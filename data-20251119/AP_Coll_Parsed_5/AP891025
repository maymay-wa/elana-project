congress wednesday sent president bush a 345 
billion relief package the largest ever for a single disaster to 
help northern californians rebuild homes businesses and roads 
shattered by last weeks earthquake 
final approval in the house came on a vote of 303107 hours 
after the senate voted its consent 971 the senate had sweetened a 
285 billion version of the bill passed tuesday by the house by 
making an additional 600 million of small business administration 
disaster loans available to companies hurt by the quake 
this is a tremendous amount of good will rep vic fazio 
dcalif who helped lead his state congressional delegations 
efforts to win federal aid told his colleagues we thank all of 
you 
white house spokesman robert hall said bush would sign the bill 
first thing thursday morning that was virtually a necessity 
largely because the measure was attached to legislation allowing 
the government to continue functioning through its latest fiscal 
crisis 
even though the governments authority to spend money 
technically expired at midnight all federal employees were to 
report to work as usual on thursday morning hall said 
the assistance was directed at what appears to have been the 
costliest natural disaster in american history with damage 
estimates now exceeding 71 billion the oct 17 quake measured 
at 71 on the richter scale killed 63 people with 9 unaccounted 
for 3000 injured and nearly 14000 homeless 
the earthquake measure comes on the heels of a 11 billion 
relief package approved last month to help victims of hurricane 
hugo the previous federal assistance record for a single disaster 
it is very likely that the ultimate federal cost may be 
higher as the damage estimates continue to grow warned sen alan 
cranston dcalif but this is a very good very important 
allocation for a community that has been very badly shaken 
the aid was part of a mustpass bill to keep federal agencies in 
business for the next three weeks because only two of the 13 
annual appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 have been enacted the 
governments authority to spend money would otherwise expire at 
midnight wednesday fiscal 1990 began oct 1 
the earthquake relief portion provides 11 billion for housing 
families losses damaged public property and other assistance 
through the federal emergency management agency 
it makes available 1 billion for highway and bridge repair 
creates a 250 million fund for bush to distribute and pours an 
additional 500 million into the sbas emergency loan pot which 
previously contained 1 billion it also increases by 600 million 
to a total of 18 billion the maximum amount of emergency loans 
which the sba is authorized to make 
though the sba would start with about 15 billion in its 
emergency pool it could issue loans up to the 18 billion figure 
as the pool is replenished by repayments 
people who are dislocated from their homes and businesses need 
that assistance now said sen pete wilson rcalif 
at the insistence of california lawmakers the measure also 
clears away several bureaucratic hurdles that would have restricted 
the assistance it makes the san franciscooakland bay bridge 
where a section of road collapsed eligible for federal assistance 
because it is a toll road it would not have otherwise qualified 
it also extends from 90 to 180 days the period in which 
california would not have to provide state funds to be eligible for 
federal assistance 
in addition 20 million of the funds would be used to study 
earthquakes and techniques to prepare for them 
the quake was centered on the san andreas fault in the santa 
cruz mountains 56 miles south of san francisco 
some money in the bill could be used to help victims of hugo and 
about 19 other disaster areas that still qualify for federal 
assistance the lions share however is intended for victims of 
the earthquake 
sen gordon humphrey rnh cast the sole vote against the 
bill in the senate saying he did so because it exceeded the 25 
billion sought by the administration and would fuel the nations 
deficit sens edward kennedy dmass and claiborne pell dri 
did not vote

state prison inmates took eight guards 
hostage and set four fires in a sevenhour riot touched off when a 
prisoner assaulted a staff worker officials said at least 42 
people mostly prison employees were injured 
the disturbance at the mediumsecurity state correctional 
institute at camp hill began at 3 pm and ended shortly before 11 
pm superintendent robert freeman said 
the incident at camp hill is over we are fully in control of 
the institution he said 
the injured included 35 guards or staff people five inmates 
including one who had been stabbed with a screwdriver one 
firefighter and one state trooper said john palakovich assistant 
to the prison superintendent 
the hostages were released by 9 pm but prison officials did 
not say how long they had been held 
formal negotiations between the inmates who carried homemade 
weapons and a team of prison guards began at 6 pm and the first 
hostages were released at 8 pm freeman said 
the inmates had demanded a press conference changes in medical 
care and family visit rules and amnesty freeman said in response 
to the demands the superintendent said he plans to meet with a 
group of inmates on wednesday 
freeman said some of the hostages had been beaten and received 
medical treatment but he had no details on their condition 
all cell blocks were secure and all but one fire was 
extinguished by 10 pm palakovich said

assaulted by an inmate at the e gatehouse the incident carried 
over to two nearby cellblock areas fires were started at the 
prison furniture factory a commissary and another food service 
area palakovich said 
a reporter for the patriotnews said she saw a number of inmates 
try to crash a truck through a rear gate there was no official 
confirmation of that account but witnesses said the truck did not 
get through the fence 
freeman said the riot was apparently ignited by inmate anger 
over a recent prison ban on inmates families bringing in homemade 
food out of fears it was being used to hide contraband 
the prison has 2607 inmates about 45 percent over capacity 
the 52acre complex about three miles from harrisburg was opened in

uncertain times lie ahead for chinas movie 
industry which faces new political constraints just as a 
generation of young ambitious directors strives to compete on 
international screens 
like others in the art world studio heads and directors are 
waiting to see the full impact of the crackdown on liberalism that 
has followed the june crackdown on studentled demonstrations for 
democratic reform 
the early signs have not been encouraging 
the central governments film bureau which supervises all 
movies has fired the head of the beijing film studio for 
unspecified political errors and sent in a special team led by 
bureau director teng jingxian to rectify the studio 
liu cheng in charge of censorship at the bureau said he sent 
urgent telegrams this fall to chinas two most innovative 
studios the xian film studio in western china and the pearl river 
film studio in canton warning them to pay special attention to 
problems in ideological tendencies 
asked what that meant liu laughed and said when they see 
the warning they understand 
film officials did not even try to select this years best movie 
in the golden rooster competition chinas politically charged 
version of the academy awards the selection was hard enough in 
past years when awards were sometimes delayed for months while 
officials debated the political merits of films nominated for 
artistic reasons this year officials said no movies were 
acceptable 
all studios like other work units have been ordered to hold 
special classes to study recent communist party documents on the 
battle against bourgeois liberalism or antisocialist ideas 
and the need for art to serve socialism 
liu said at the film bureau the classes take up two halfdays a 
week far more than ordinary work units 
two of chinas leading film directors were overseas when the 
crackdown began and one chen kaige has said he wont return he 
plans to make a documentary about the june army attack on beijing 
protesters in which hundreds and possibly thousands were killed 
the other xian studio head wu tianming has not been in touch 
with his studio since he left for canada in april to attend the 
opening of a joint chinesecanadian movie about chinas first 
emperor 
studio officials say they dont know if wu will return and liu 
acknowledged it was hard to say if wu would be allowed to keep 
his job if he did wus blunt criticisms of government censors long 
have gotten him in trouble and his studios movies have angered 
some officials by depicting rural poverty and mindless bureaucracy 
but the debtridden studio in arid impoverished northern china 
also has won more international prizes than any other studio 
beginning with wus 1987 old well which won awards in tokyo 
and hawaii 
the movies frank depiction of rural poverty and daring story of 
a love triangle set off a small storm within the chinese movie 
industry more accustomed to socialist morality tales 
young directors at other studios joined the movement to make 
realistic movies of modern life adopting film techniques from 
abroad and critics said chinas film industry had finally matured 
no movies of the new school have been released since the june 
crackdown only epics of the communist revolution timed to 
celebrate the 40th anniversary of its victory in october 1949 
but wang jin vice president of the pearl river studio said in 
an interview that the film bureau recently approved a movie the 
studio shot before june depicting smuggling and other illegal 
activities 
last spring pearl river released what it billed as chinas 
first sex movie a story of love and marriage in a 1940s 
fishing village i think we can still make this kind of movie 
wang said 
but the studio will no longer test the censors by sending them 
love scenes it thinks likely to be cut it will make the cuts 
itself he said 
directors yan xueshu and zhou xiaowen at the xian studio also 
said they hope to continue their experimental work 
movements happen we are used to them zhou said if the 
government insisted on changing a movie he made he added boldly 
id resign 
and start your own studio yan asked him sarcastically

margaret thatcher provokes 
outrage admiration bewilderment and few south africans who 
follow foreign affairs are neutral about the british prime minister 
from the commonwealth summit meeting in distant malaysia this 
week mrs thatcher consolidated her status as a dominant figure in 
south africas political disputes 
her determined opposition to tougher economic sanctions against 
south africa was praised by conservative whites and denounced by 
antiapartheid leaders 
thank you maggie said an editorial tuesday in the citizen 
a progovernment johannesburg daily we south africans appreciate 
your brave honest and lone battle against sanctions 
president fw de klerk in a speech monday night lauded the 
leader of britains conservative party and said intensified 
sanctions would undermine his proposals for political reform 
murphy morobe a senior spokesman for the antiapartheid 
movement said with understatement that mrs thatchers position 
does not coincide with ours moses mayekiso a black trade 
union leader said mrs thatcher went to the summit to defend the 
apartheid regime 
the 49nation commonwealth composed of britain and its former 
colonies adopted a declaration sunday calling for tougher 
financial measures against south africa and giving the whiteled 
government six months to fulfill promises to dismantle apartheid 
the declaration incorporated mrs thatchers objections but an 
hour later to the dismay of other participants she issued a 
separate statement outlining her reasons for dissent 
she said tougher sanctions will hurt south africas blacks and 
increase white resistance to de klerks reform program 
on tuesday she told a news conference in kuala lumpur i am in 
step with the people of south africa 
south africa a former british colony withdrew from the 
commonwealth in 1961 as other members increased their demands that 
it end its policies of racial separation 
business day a johannesburgbased financial newspaper often 
critical of the government said mrs thatcher performed more 
honorably at kuala lumpur than two prosanctions advocates prime 
ministers robert hawke of australia and brian mulroney of canada 
hawke and mulroney have found in south africa a rare 
opportunity for moral posturing business day said they dont 
know or care what harm they do 
mrs thatcher has the good sense to recognize fundamental 
changes when they occur sufficient faith in human nature to dare 
to hope for better times and the courage to back her judgment 
the editorial said that is why she towers over men like hawke 
and mulroney even if she turns out in the end to be wrong at 
least she is not a pygmy 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate residential districts schools and health services

a century after the vatican lost control of rome 
politicians are accusing it of still trying to control the citys 
politics 
the charge stems from a speech by a top church administrator 
the papal vicar for rome suggesting that the citys voters choose 
the christian democrats italys only churchlinked party in 
mayoral elections this weekend 
the appeal by cardinal ugo poletti has sparked a national outcry 
about roman catholic church involvement in italian politics 
we seem to have returned to the rome of the popes commented 
bettino craxi leader of the socialist party 
the debate underlines how powerful religion is considered even 
in a city that appears overwhelmingly secular with low mass 
attendance porno movie houses and condom ads on buses it has 
overshadowed such pressing concerns as traffic pollution social 
services and housing 
poletti came under attack particularly for saying voters should 
make courageous choices even at the expense of personal 
sacrifice or repugnance 
his statement was interpreted as calling for support for the 
christian democrats despite the fact that successive city 
governments led by the party have been embroiled in scandal 
it is worrying that cardinal poletti invites people to 
vote for the christian democrats even when they feel 
repugnance said giorgio la malfa leader of the small republican 
party 
since july rome has been run by a special commissioner named by 
the national government after christian democrat mayor pietro 
giubilo resigned giubilo had been accused of steering contracts 
for school lunches to friends he denied he did anything wrong 
while the elections are simply to choose a city council which 
in turn elects the mayor they have major symbolic significance 
both for the church and the italian political parties 
the oct 2930 ballot is the first since the christian democrats 
won back control of city hall in 1985 after nine years of rule by 
the communists italys secondbiggest party 
the vatican was embarrassed by communist rule in the city of 
popes and unhappy about several communist policies such as 
extension of abortion services consequently it is anxious to see a 
party espousing catholic values returned to city hall 
political parties meanwhile see the rome elections as a 
barometer of their popularity nationwide and a chance to land a 
highprofile post 
the importance of the vote has prompted several parties to send 
top politicians including premier giulio andreotti a christian 
democrat to stump for mayoral candidates craxi sailed down the 
tiber river to promote his man tourism minister franco carraro 
the vatican controlled the city of rome for 400 years until 
italian unification hero giuseppe garibaldis troops entered the 
city in 1870 
but the church has long kept a hand in italian politics and its 
support of the christian democrats has been credited with helping 
keep the communists out of national government for more than four 
decades 
much of the churchs traditional influence however has waned 
in italy as western european society has become more secular 
less than 25 percent of the population attends mass regularly in 
the city that is the world center of catholicism 
only about 72 percent of marriages in the italian capital this 
year were in church even though around 90 percent of the 
population calls itself catholic according to figures from city 
hall and the catholic organization caritas 
still the catholic church is considered a powerful political 
force in the eternal city 
the turinbased newspaper la stampa recently surveyed the 
strength of romes religious orders and lay catholic organizations 
and concluded they comprised around 60000 people rome has 23 
million eligible voters 
more than 39 percent of romans questioned in a survey in the 
italian newsmagazine panorama felt cardinal polettis appeal would 
have a lot or some influence on the votes of catholics 
the latest controversy came as the vatican has been sparring 
with christian democrat politicians over conditions in the capital 
in february pope john paul ii urged city officials to stop 
squabbling among themselves he described rome as a city of two 
faces where wealth and poverty exist side by side 
both poletti and the vatican newspaper osservatore romano were 
critical of giubilo the mayor who resigned 
the fact that poletti urged support for the party he had been 
criticizing was not lost on politicians

ann smith likes to be where the action is 
when disaster strikes 
bob lytles wife wanted him out of her kitchen 
both retired they are reservists for the federal emergency 
management agency who help the agency stretch when the pressure is 
on 
last month they were helping victims of hurricane hugo now 
theyre pulling 12hours shifts at the veterans memorial building 
in oakland where fema set up its disaster assistance center to 
handle applications for grants and lowinterest loans 
smith 61 retired in june from the california department of 
transportation office in redding but has been a fema reservist for 
three years 
before she retired she saved up vacation time to work disasters 
its an organization thats there quickly and we like to be 
part of the action said smith who is assistant manager of the 
disaster assistance center here 
lytle 78 of tempe ariz a retired associated professor of 
agricultural engineering has been a reservist 12 years 
my wife said she married for better or worse but not for 
lunch said lytle she wanted to know what are you going to 
do to stay out of my kitchen 
until recently neither one had been sent to a disaster in more 
than a year and a half 
on sept 1 lytle was sent to baton rouge la to a flood 
three weeks later he was sent to charleston sc for hurricane 
hugo a day at home and he was in oakland to help open an 
earthquake disaster assistance center 
smith was packed and ready to go to the grand canyon on vacation 
with her husband larry another fema reservist now working in 
monterey county when the call came sept 24 for hugo 
we split our clothes into two suitcases and off we went to 
puerto rico she said 
three weeks later they both were sent to help out with the 
quake 
we had a beautiful spring and summer at home she said i 
havent been home at all this fall 
both find getting their laundry done one of the biggest 
challenges 
if you go to a laundromat thats an hour you could be 
sleeping lytle said 
coasttocoast diasters have stretched fema but it hasnt 
snapped yet said spokesman bill mcada in washington 
i sure dont want to see it strained much more though 
mcada said right now i have laying on my desk a request for a 
disaster declaration from the state of kentucky where flood 
damages are estimated at 12 million mcada said were about to 
find out whether we can meet more demands or not 
the agency has 3000 people assigned to hurricane hugo and the 
california earthquake he said of them only 200 are fulltime 
fema employees six hundred are regular reservists who have been 
trained in advance and are called up in time of need the remaining 
2200 are hired locally and get one day of training before being 
thrown in the breach 
hurricane damage has accounted for 350000 disaster aid 
applications from puerto rico 8000 from the virgin islands 
51000 from south carolina and 2800 from north carolina mcada 
said 
a week after the earthquake struck californias bay area 10000 
applications have come in from the 12 disaster centers in seven 
counties said fema spokeswoman rhoda brooks 
more than 400 people of various specialties from the army corps 
of engineers have been dispatched from around the country to verify 
disaster claims before fema signs checks 
the total number of applications from hugo and the earthquake 
alone amount to more than three years worth under normal 
ccircumstances mcada said 
i dont think our people would ever admit they have reached 
their limit somewhere down the line you will run out of manpower 
but i dont know where that is he said 
do you put together an agency that is big enough to handle the 
current situation then sit around and do nothing for a year 
thats not very effecive 
instead fema lets people like smith and lytle do the sitting 
around 
i just sit at home and rock slowly til they call me lytle

a study suggests the nutritional needs of 
women with eating disorders differ from those of normal women 
a study by western psychiatric institute and clinic found that 
women recovering from bulimia needed only 73 percent of the normal 
intake of calories conversely women recovering from anorexia 
needed twothirds more calories than normal 
bulimia is the disorder of gorging and purging anorexia is an 
avoidance of food 
the study of 23 recovering bulimic women who were trying to 
maintain normal weight found that the women required only 10 
calories per pound of body weight or 73 percent of the 138 daily 
calories per pound that healthy women need 
separate studies involving 31 recovering anorexic women found 
they needed 223 calories per pound of body weight to maintain 
their normal weight 
these findings have led to new treatment methods in our 
program and they help us to understand the physiological 
factors that complicate the psychological issues of eating 
disorders said dr walter kaye director of the institutes 
center for overcoming problem eating 
the findings were published in a recent issue of the american 
journal of nutrition and released to the public tuesday in 
conjunction with easting disorders awareness week 
the studies were conducted during the last three years kaye 
said

please doesnt anybody out there love a 
bureaucrat 
last june entrepreneur matthew lesko launched my favorite 
bureaucrat contest and invited people around the country to 
submit a brief verifiable story of 250 words or less about how a 
government bureaucrat helped you 
lesko offered a 5000 cash prize for the winning entry and 
figured hed be swamped with nominations after all he says there 
are plenty of federal state and local bureaucrats to choose from 
about 15 million altogether 
today lesko is flabbergasted in the past four months he has 
received exactly one entry 
even worse it was submitted by a woman employee of the new york 
state department of taxation and finance who nominated her boss 
my god i just cant believe the lack of response said 
lesko the author of books and newsletters on where to get free 
advice from government experts on everything from playing the stock 
market to curing a backache to buying a new refrigerator 
lesko says he plugged the contest in thousands of news releases 
mailed from his suburban chevy chase md office on larry kings 
radio show pat sajaks television show and the cspan cable tv 
network and in speeches around the country promoting the dozen 
books he has written 
besides the 5000 prize for the contest winner lesko promised 
500 to each of two runnersup a plaque for the winning favorite 
bureaucrat and a free list of the governments two dozen best 
sources of information for every contest participant 
i cant believe how this idea fell so flat lesko 
complained he suspects the problem runs deeper than any lack of 
publicity 
the government is the biggest source of information and help 
on anything you could want he said all the millionaires like 
lee iacocca and donald trump use it i even got free legal advice 
from the federal trade commission on how to run this contest 
but the average guy in the street probably just hates the 
government is intimidated by it and doesnt think theres anything 
there but waste fraud and abuse lesko said 
the only contact most people have with the government is 
dealing with the internal revenue service and the division of motor 
vehicles which are probably the two worst experiences anybody can 
have 
the publics antagonism toward the government apparently is so 
virulent lesko said that a contest to nominate the biggest 
bureaucratic bunglers probably would produce a flood of entries 
i wouldnt do that to the post office he said 
someone who understands the publics reluctance to identify 
helpful competent bureaucrats is james h boren a former state 
department official and washington humorist who is president of the 
international association of professional bureaucrats 
people are rather fearful of making such information public 
boren said if they say a bureaucrat has helped them its like 
saying theyve seen a ufo in the sky people might think theyre 
not totally balanced

explosions that may have been caused by 
illegal fireworks leveled one house and set two others on fire 
tuesday killing at least two people and injuring 13 others 
authorities said 
crews worked into the night searching the rubble for other 
possible victims of the blast said fire chief bim orrenmaa 
he said illegal fireworks were suspected as the cause of the 
explosions which rocked this city of 13000 on lake erie at the 
northeast corner of ohio 
the fire chief initially said the explosion killed three people 
but later revised the number to two saying he had been incorrectly 
told that one injured person had died 
brian hubbard an investigator with the ashtabula county 
coroners office confirmed two deaths 
orrenmaa said firefighters found devices that looked like 
fireworks in the home where the explosion and two subsequent blasts 
occurred just before noon 
we had a lot of small bangs before the big explosion and 
two subsequent blasts orrenmaa said 
students were evacuated from a nearby elementary school but 
there were no other evacuations 
patrolman michael strine said the explosion blew out windows of 
at least 20 homes in a sixblock area 
the victims were not immediately identified 
a 46yearold woman who lived at the house where the explosions 
occurred was taken to hamot medical center in erie pa 25 miles 
east of conneaut said hospital spokeswoman wendy depalma she was 
in satisfactory condition 
twelve people were taken to brown memorial hospital in conneaut 
then released said hospital administrator george whitney he said 
most of the injuries did not appear serious 
john kingsolver an agent with the federal bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms said 10 agents were at the scene kingsolver 
said that tubes resembling parts of fireworks were found 
the state emergency management agency in ashtabula county said 
it was investigating

dr samuel h sheppard acquitted in the 
murder of his wife after the us supreme court reversed his 
conviction due to pretrial publicity always feared he would be put 
back in prison his son said 
ending 20 years of silence on the case sam r sheppard said in 
a speech that he is speaking out in hopes of clearing his fathers 
name 
every reference to that landmark supreme court decision 23 
years ago calls my father a convicted murderer he said tuesday 
35 years after his father was first brought to trial thats not 
fair that conviction was thrown out 
the elder sheppard an osteopath who was well known in the 
cleveland suburb of bay village was convicted of murder in the 
1954 bludgeoning of his pregnant wife marilyn he served nine 
years in prison before the nations high court reversed the 
conviction 
sheppard was acquitted after a second trial he died in 1970 at 
age 46 the case remains unsolved 
the younger sheppard 42 had been long silent on the case until 
this weeks speaking tour on tuesday he spoke at youngstown state 
university 
he was 7 years old at the time of the slaying and lived with an 
uncle after after his father was imprisoned after the supreme 
court decision the elder sheppard feared constantly that he would 
be forced to return to prison his son said 
his exoneration in 1966 eased those worries but created new ones 
there is still this stigma in our society that if youre 
accused youre guilty he said he couldnt cope with society 
he was a great guy but i kept my distance i didnt want to 
go down with him that was the agreement between us 
sheppard said the person he believed responsible for his 
mothers killing was the same person who broke into his familys 
house two days before the slaying that person he said later was 
convicted in an unrelated slaying 
he said he knew the identity of the alleged killer but would 
not reveal the name to the audience 
last summer police indicated they might consider reopening the 
investigation into mrs sheppards slaying following the murder 
conviction of the sheppards onetime window washer 
richard eberling was arrested in 1959 after being found with a 
large amount of jewelry belonging to marilyn sheppard and her 
husbands brother richard sheppard 
in august eberling told the cleveland plain dealer from 
prison that he was familiar with the circumstances surrounding mrs 
sheppards death

any effort by president bush to exercise a 
lineitem veto will prompt a lawsuit by members of congress the 
chairman of a house judiciary subcommittee says 
the lineitem veto is an idea that many of us would resist 
very diligently rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the 
civil and constitutional rights subcommittee of the house judiciary 
committee said tuesday after white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said bush was considering such a move 
bush fitzwater said is prepared to take such a step despite 
lack of specific constitutional authority to see if it works 
although bush has called for a constitutional amendment to give 
him the ability to veto just one item in a bill while leaving the 
rest intact such a proposal has never made much headway in 
congress 
former president reagan tried unsuccessfully for eight years to 
persuade congress to propose such a constitutional change to the 
states for ratification 
some legal scholars contend that lineitem veto powers are 
implied in a presidents overall veto power however the concept 
has never been tested 
such a notion edwards said in an interview comes from chit 
chat in conservative circles and has little constitutional 
legitimacy 
we are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test 
case but at this point we dont have one fitzwater said adding 
that it was anticipated such a move would provoke a court challenge 
were bush to cast such a veto edwards said a majority of the 
members of the judiciary committee would promptly take him to 
court 
however edwards conceded the issue could remain in limbo for 
years until it makes its way to the supreme court 
conservatives could have a field day he said they think 
they could get several years of lineitem vetoes 
administration sources said it was unlikely the test case would 
come soon because there is nothing before the president that is a 
likely candidate 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said a 
tentative target had been selected by white house counsel boyden 
gray a provision once in the interior department appropriations 
bill to ban a requirement that members of congress keep a log of 
contacts with lobbyists 
however the house stripped the provision from the bill before 
the president could decide whether to exercise a lineitem veto 
white house officials are keeping a sharp eye out however for 
another candidate sources said they are looking for a provision

emergency crews searched the charred 
twisted rubble of a plastics plant tuesday looking for victims of 
fiery explosions that hurled wreckage miles away at least two 
people were killed 22 presumed dead and 124 injured 
theres just nothing left harris county sheriff johnny 
klevenhagen said after venturing into the stillsmoldering plant 
no 5 at the phillips petroleum co complex 
officials located but could not remove the body of a second 
victim tuesday partly buried in mounds of concrete and steel 
beams they said it would take heavy equipment to fully search the 
ruins one body was found monday 
company officials in pasadena said late tuesday that the 22 
missing workers were presumed dead 
any employee in that wreckage probably didnt survive said 
jere smith director of public relations for phillips 
later tuesday officials at the companys bartlesville okla 
headquarters said 19 phillips employees were either dead or missing 
and four contract workers were missing for a total of 23 
spokesman bill wertz could not explain the discrepancy in the 
victim totals 
fires that followed the blasts and were fueled by highly 
flammable chemicals had been contained in small areas only a thin 
column of smoke rose from the plant tuesday 24 hours after the 
first explosions which shattered windows three miles away and were 
felt 25 miles away 
some entire buildings inside the chemical plant complex had 
disappeared klevenhagen said and elsewhere pipes and metal 
framework were broken and dangling 
it is devastated klevenhagen said major major damage 
its going to take extremely heavy equipment to remove the debris 
the problem were finding is that there are areas of the plant 
we just cant get to were going to have to bring in a bulldozer 
to make a road 
klevenhagen and a crew of firefighters safety inspectors and a 
medical examiner made the first foray into the ruins at the complex 
outside houston 
frantic relatives gathered and scanned lists of known survivors 
monday night many continued their vigil outside the plant tuesday 
mary de la vergne 38 found the name of her husband cipriana 
rodriguez 43 on the list of missing workers 
i had just taken him lunch said ms de la vergne i heard 
the explosion when i was going back home 
i can only keep on hoping she said collapsing into tears 
of the 124 people reported injured 35 remained hospitalized 
tuesday with six in critical condition dr paul pepe houstons 
emergency medical director said the patient in the worst condition 
was a woman with first and seconddegree burns over half her body 
the plant which produced 45 million pounds a day of 
polyethylene plastic used in everything from milk jugs to grocery 
sacks erupted in a series of explosions that began just after 1 
pm monday sending debris flying as far as six miles 
the fire raged into the evening monday fueled by plastics and 
by ethylene and isobutane gases which are both used to make 
plastics by tuesday it had been contained in small controlled 
areas 
we dont feel there is any danger of further explosions 
said smith were past that 
as many as 400 firefighters battled the blaze water had to 
pumped from a sewage treatment plant and the nearby houston ship 
channel after the explosions knocked out water service to the area 
officials arranged tuesday to move hundreds of employees cars 
that were damaged in the parking lot and hampered cleanup efforts 
more than 900 people work in three shifts at the plant built in

headquarters in bartlesville okla workers whose jobs were 
affected by the explosion will continue to be paid smith said but 
some may be laid off later 
officials didnt immediately know what caused the explosion 
phillips environmental director bill stoltz said a seal blew out 
on an ethylene loop reactor in which chemical reactions take place 
to create polyethylene out of ethylene a component of natural gas 
the seal break released hydrocarbon vapor which ignited 
there are 100 ways that could occur we dont know how the 
ignition occurred phillips president glenn cox said 
the ethylene is fed to the plant through a pipeline from sweeny 
about 75 miles southwest of the plant in this town of 100000 
people the pipeline was shut down after the blast 
inspectors from the environmental protection agency and the 
occupational safety and health administration joined phillips 
emergency response team in assessing damages 
robert benz plastic resins manager at the plant said there was 
no immediate damage estimate itll be a big number he said

president bush excused his lateness for an 
award ceremony for math teachers by joking he was busy trying to 
solve a few quadratic equations he said the exercise was 
somewhat more difficult than balancing the budget 
having pretty much given up on the notion of balancing the 
budget any time soon administration officials are trying to juggle 
a slew of budgetpolicy equations to gloss over a continuing 
impasse with congress 
bush told the math and science teachers gathered in the rose 
garden on tuesday that he gets much of his scientific understanding 
from the comic strips 
he cited a gary larson cartoon where after detailed 
calculations einstein discovers that time is actually money 
time was money in fact in the federal response to the 
california earthquake 
last weeks devastating quake gave rise to weekend speculation 
that the administration was considering some form of tax surcharge 
or increase most likely in the gasoline tax to help pay for a 
federal relief effort expected to cost us taxpayers around 3 
billion 
after all thats a big chunk and where was the money to come 
from in an already overburdened federal budget 
the tax speculation was fueled by bushs own repeated failure to 
rule out a tax increase when asked by reporters about the prospects 
during his tour of the san francisco bay areas earthquake damage 
however it turned out that bush once again could stick with 
the no new taxes vow of the 1988 campaign 
a quirk in the nations budget laws allowed administration and 
congressional officials to find money for quake relief without 
having to face the issue of raising taxes 
congress inability to agree on a deficitreduction package for 
the fiscal year that began oct 1 resulted in acrosstheboard cuts 
of 161 billion under the grammrudman budget balancing law 
but those cuts took effect oct 16 the day before the 
earthquake and there is no mechanism for further automatic budget 
reductions for another year 
thus the grammrudman law is not applicable in this case 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater declared its a 
whole other ball game he said 
budget director richard darman and congressional budgeters are 
finding other equations that like larsons einstein turn time or 
at least delay into money 
for instance by not counting the cost of the governments 
bailout of savings and loan institutions as part of the deficit 
the real degree of red ink is understated 
and the deficit is further made to look less menacing by 
another accounting gimmick involving social security funds 
the current surplus in the social security trust fund a 
surplus that will vanish once babyboom generation workers get to 
retirement age around the turn of the century is being used to 
help finance the deficit 
the law requires money in the fund to be used to buy government 
securities which in turn are largely used to finance the deficit 
not only are social security receipts being used to help retire the 
national debt but the fact that theres a surplus in the account 
makes the deficit in other programs look smaller on paper 
the real current budget deficit discounting the social 
security surplus and putting back in the costs of the sampl bailout 
and other programs now exempt is closer to 250 billion than the 
1162 billion projected by the omb 
meanwhile bush doesnt have much to say these days about the 
flexible freeze he talked about during his campaign 
but he told the math and science teachers i had a friend who 
was so smart once that he knew how to convert meters to gallons in 
his head

ten years and 15 million afghan lives ago 
the soviet union invaded afghanistan this week soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze called it a mistake 
but shevardnadze gave no indication that the kremlin was 
withdrawing its military support to the government created by the 
soviet invasion 
the current afghan government was put in place as a result of 
the intervention that he now says was a contravention of moral 
norms said barnett r rubin a specialist on afghanistan at the 
washingtonbased institute for peace 
in a speech to the supreme soviet on monday shevardnadze 
admitted the 1979 invasion of afghanistan ignored universal human 
values and involved gross violations of our own laws 
onethird of afghanistans prewar population of 14 million has 
fled the country since the invasion and about 70 percent of the 
nations cities villages and agricultural land have been 
destroyed according to administration estimates 
it is unusual but not unprecedented for the foreign minister of 
a superpower to acknowledge that a previous administration erred in 
wreaking such devastation on another country 
cyrus r vance in confirmation hearings before the senate 
foreign relations committee before he became president carters 
secretary of state in 1977 said the us intervention in vietnam 
was wrong 
in the light of hindsight i believe it was a mistake to have 
intervened in vietnam vance testified pledging not to 
mislead congress as carters predecessors had done in waging war 
in indochina 
carter continued the detente of his republican predecessors but 
rapprochement with moscow fell apart when the red army invaded 
afghanistan in december 1979 
carter canceled us participation in the 1980 summer olympic 
games in moscow embargoed the sale of us grain to the soviet 
union and began to aid afghan guerrillas 
despite vances capitulation the united states still has not 
granted diplomatic recognition to vietnams communist government 
14 years after the fall of the usbacked government in saigon 
nor could vance restore the lives of the 900000 vietnamese and 
60000 americans who died in the conflict 
and his statements did not mark a permanent change in us 
policy president reagan made it clear he did not share vances 
opposition to military intervention abroad as he armed nicaraguas 
contra guerrillas invaded grenada and bombed the headquarters of 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
vance accepted blame whereas shevardnadze did not vance had 
been an architect of the us war in vietnam serving as army 
secretary and undersecretary of defense in the kennedy and johnson 
administrations 
shevardnadze in his speech stressed that when the red army 
invaded afghanistan in december 1979 he and the current soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev were nonvoting members of the ruling 
communist party politburo 
i found out about what had happened from radio and newspaper 
reports a decision that had very serious consequences for our 
country was made behind the back of the party and the people we 
were confronted with a fait accompli shevardnadze said 
a private american specialist on afghanistan selig harrison of 
the carnegie endowment for peace in washington said that during a 
trip to moscow in april he was told that gorbachev was an early 
opponent of the afghan invasion but there is little direct 
evidence of that 
there was substantial disagreement from the beginning 
harrison said gorbachev who in 1979 was the politburo member in 
charge of agriculture expressed objections to the diversion of 
funds to the war that had been programmed for agriculture 
harrison said 
since the red army withdrew in february soviet military aid to 
the afghan government headed by president najibullah has been 
estimated at 250 million to 300 million a month by us 
government analysts and at up to 400 million a month by rep don 
ritter rpa a harsh critic of the kremlin 
by contrast the united states has been sending an estimated 
500 million a year in military aid to mujahedeen guerrillas of 
afghanistan 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said we 
welcome the soviet admission and encourage them to take the next 
logical step to correct the soviet mistake transfer of power from 
the illegitimate najibullah regime to a government acceptable to 
all the afghan people

the government is again easing the zero 
tolerance antidrug policy which required immediate seizure of 
illegal drug users cars and boats to let some people pay a fine 
and go on their way 
our goal and intent is still user accountability said 
customs service senior special agent ed callahan who oversees the 
program along with the coast guard 
the changes are intended to streamline the program make it 
more effective more equitable he said tuesday 
officials hope the new guidelines will save time and money now 
spent on seizing cars trucks and boats at the borders or in us 
territorial limits because small amounts of illegal drugs are found 
inside 
this is the third easing in the zero tolerance program since it 
began march 21 1988 with thencustoms commissioner william von 
raab declaring there will be no mercy 
under the original rules a driver heading across the border 
into the united states with a small amount of marijuana in his car 
could be stopped and his auto seized by the government if he 
wanted to get the car back immediately he would have to pay the 
full value of the car plus any fines said customs service 
spokesman dennis shimkoski 
the new guidelines were signed oct 18 by acting customs 
commissioner michael lane but they were effective oct 11 
the limits of drugs for which the new rules apply are an ounce 
of marijuana or hashish a gram of cocaine heroin or 
methamphetamine onetenth of a gram of pcp and 500 micrograms of 
lsd callahan said 
under the new rules callahan said the car still could be 
seized by federal agents under certain circumstances such as if 
the driver were impaired by the drug found in the car more likely 
the driver simply would be charged with a failure to report that he 
was bringing marijuana into the country 
that violation required a penalty of 5000 to 10000 but the 
customs service has reduced that by 90 percent he said 
realizing that that is not proportionate to the violation the 
penalty would be 500 for the first offense 1000 for the second 
offense callahan said 
if you pay that penalty at the time of the incident you get 
in your car and drive away he said if you refuse to pay the 
penalty the automobile will be seized just as it was in the past 
because we have made an offer of a mitigated penalty which you 
have rejected 
but forget putting the fine on visa or mastercharge the customs 
service doesnt take plastic only cash a cashiers check or some 
other negotiable instrument he said 
if the cars owner had loaned the auto to someone else who was 
carrying a small amount of an illegal drug the federal agent would 
decide on a casebycase basis what would happen to the car 
callahan said 
since the zero tolerance program began customs has seized 8076 
personal vehicles such as cars pickup trucks and motorcycles 452 
commercialtype trucks 190 boats and 13 aircraft shimkoski said 
about 75 percent of the total value has been returned to its 
owners excluding penalties 
the new guidelines also change the policy for boats found with 
the useramounts of drugs on board under the new guidelines the 
owners of all boats with such drugs on board will be issued a 
summons requiring them to report to customs in 15 to 30 days for 
handling of their case callahan said 
the government in february exempted fishing boats heading to or 
from fishing grounds from immediate seizure other boats however 
were subject to seizure requiring the coast guard to bring the 
boats to shore keep them safe and take in the owners 
under the first revision in the policy made in may 1988 
customs or coast guard authorities who found small amounts of drugs 
on boats more than 12 miles offshore would seize the boats only if 
they appeared to be transporting drugs into the country 
the change was prompted by an outcry that erupted when the 
atlantis ii owned by the woods hole oceanographic institution of 
massachusetts the 25 million yacht ark royal and the monkey 
business the pleasure boat that former presidential candidate 
gary hart sailed on with model donna rice were seized when small 
quantities of drugs were discovered on board

senate republicans who want to blunt 
democrats efforts to seize the upper hand on us aid to eastern 
europe are proposing their own threeyear 585 million program 
meanwhile president bush struck back at critics of his aid 
program saying in an interview with the new york times that hes 
tired of complaints from people who found poland on the globe 
about three weeks ago 
the gop plan for poland and hungary assembled by minority 
leader bob dole rkan and seven republican colleagues was a 
middle ground between bushs 450 million proposal and an 837 
million version passed by the house last week 
we do not believe the test of american policy in poland and 
hungary is how many dollars we spend but how we can best achieve 
our national goals in those two countries dole said in a 
statement 
the issue was scheduled to come to the senate floor today 
in an interview published in todays editions of the times bush 
said changes taking place in eastern europe are absolutely 
extraordinary but im not going to be stampeded into overreacting 
to any of this 
democrats on capitol hill have been calling me timid bush 
said i have other better words like cautious diplomatic 
prudent 
an outline of the bill calls the gop approach generous but 
fiscally prudent rejecting the notion that poland will benefit 
from a bidding war between american political parties 
democrats have criticized bushs response to the sweeping 
changes in eastern europe and sought to demonstrate leadership by 
proposing a far more generous program 
democrats higher aid figures make no economic sense at this 
point dole said contending that private enterprise will take 
time to evolve from the two countries centrally planned economies 
just pouring aid dollars into poland and hungary will not do 
the trick dole said 
the gop proposal included some of the features of the 
housepassed legislation which won strong bipartisan support 
it would provide 200 million as the us share of a 1 billion 
international fund to stabilize polands economy and 112 million 
in immediate food aid for poland but instead of providing new 
money it would require that the 200 million come out of the 
already tight foreign aid budget 
another 125 million would be used to support new private 
business ventures including joint ventures with americans the 
house bill calls for 200 million in private enterprise support 
the republican alternative omits a 200 million guarantee fund 
the house version provides to underwrite sales to poland by us 
exporters 
the senate gop bill would make the aid specifically contingent 
on continuing transition toward democracy in the two countries and 
development of a freeenterprise economy 
poland has elected a government that for the first time in four 
decades is not controlled by the communist party candidates of the 
solidarity trade union dominate the new legislature 
hungary has been making strides toward a more open political 
system as well and has become the first eastern european country 
to physically tear down fences dividing it from the west

congressional negotiators who say the united 
states is shouldering a disproportionate share of the worldwide 
defense burden approved an 85 billion military construction bill 
that cuts president bushs budget for bases overseas 
weve seen the peak for military construction spending said 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate appropriations 
subcommittee on military construction 
thwarted in earlier efforts to reduce troop levels overseas 
members of the house and senate targeted money used for such items 
as barracks munitions centers and storage facilities at military 
installations worldwide 
specifically negotiators approved an 855 million cut from the 
863 million bush requested for south korea several members of 
congress have called for reductions in the 43000 us personnel 
stationed in south korea an arrangement that costs the federal 
government 26 billion a year 
the house is expected to act thursday or friday on the 
legislation which members of the house and senate appropriations 
subcommittees on military construction approved by voice vote 
tuesday 
the bill covering the fiscal year that began oct 1 provides 
500 million less than this years level for military construction 
but about 500 million more than bush requested 
sasser discussing the senate version of the bill last month 
said the best way to make our defense dollar go further is to 
secure a more equitable burden sharing from our allies 
lawmakers agreed to cut all 408 million bush requested for the 
philippines basing the decision on upcoming negotiations on a new 
treaty to replace the military bases agreement 
the usphilippines pact under which the united states leases 
clark air base and subic bay naval base will expire in september 
1991 talks are expected to begin in december and vice president 
dan quayle said last month he was hopeful a mutually acceptable 
agreement will provide for a longtime stay by the unites states 
however opposition to the us presence is strong quayles 
visit to the philippines was marked by demonstrations hours before 
the vice president arrived two american civilians were killed near 
a us base 
philippine president corazon aquino has refused to say whether 
she favors keeping the us bases but she is expected to discuss 
the issue when she visits washington next month 
senate negotiators also accepted the house plan to allocate 500 
million to close 86 military facilities in the united states scale 
back five others and change the mission at 54 other installations 
bush had requested 500 million

bush said changes taking place in eastern europe are 
absolutely extraordinary but im not going to be stampeded into

he also said he does not share the concern that some european 
countries have about a reunified germany because i think germanys 
commitment to and recognition of the importance of the alliance is 
unshakable 
and i dont see germany in order to get reunification going 
off onto what some are concerned about and that is a neutralist 
path that puts them at odds or potentially at odds with their 
nato partners 
during a visit to eastern europe in july bush proposed a 
threeyear 149 million aid package for poland and hungary to 
encourage fledgling economic and political reforms since then 
under pressure from capitol hill he has raised the value of his 
aid proposal to about 450 million 
last week the democraticcontrolled house with strong backing 
from republicans approved a threeyear 837 million aid package 
for the two countries 
bush also has been stung by the rhetoric of democratic leaders 
who have denounced the presidents policy as timid

the energy department may have to spend more 
than 8 million to correct a newly disclosed problem at the 
savannah river nuclear weapons plant according to federal auditors 
who say the flaw raises new safety concerns 
in a report tuesday to a house government operations 
subcommittee the general accounting office revealed that tubes 
containing materials used in savannah rivers nuclear reactors were 
either made to incorrect specifications or their specifications 
could not be determined because of paperwork problems 
use of badly flawed tubes could in the worst case lead to an 
uncontrolled chain reaction in the reactors that produce a gas used 
in nuclear warheads the gao said 
when the problem was discovered in september 1988 by ei du 
pont de nemours amp co which was the savannah river operator the 
energy department ordered du pont to stop making the tubes and stop 
putting them in the reactors until the cause of the problem and its 
significance could be pinpointed 
the gao the investigative arm of congress said that several 
months later it was determined that the tube flaws werent 
serious enough to pose a safety problem but that none of them will 
be used in the reactors which have been shut down since april 1988 
for repairs and safety upgrades 
it said the energy department estimated it would cost 731000 
to replace the 174 flawed tubes and an additional 101 tubes 
affected by the problem 
keith fultz the gaos director of energy issues told the 
subcommittee the cost could go beyond 8 million depending on how 
the department chooses to handle the corrections 
the report said that while the department has taken steps aimed 
at preventing a recurrence the incident raises further questions 
about the departments ability to improve management at savannah 
river which is situated near aiken sc 
this is another in a series of incidents at savannah river 
site pointing out poor internal controls and management inattention 
to safety the gao report said 
the report said the specifications of some of the questionable 
tubes could not be determined because du ponts records were 
outofdate and gave conflicting accounts of how much enriched 
uranium and lithium were in the tubes 
department officials at the hearing provided no additional 
information about the problem and savannah river officials could 
not be reached for comment afterward 
at the same hearing the department acknowledged it may have 
erred in rewarding du pont and the operators of some of its other 
nuclear weapons plants with millions of dollars in bonuses despite 
serious failings in safety and health protection 
there is room for real question about whether the energy 
department should have paid 912000 in bonuses last year to the 
top 25 du pont managers at savannah river deputy energy secretary 
henson moore said in sworn testimony 
moore acknowledged that the three highestpaid du pont 
executives with collective government salaries of 561000 and 
bonuses of 306000 in 1988 were not based at the plant site they 
worked at du pont headquarters at wilmington del 
from 1984 through 1988 the top 25 du pont executives in charge 
of running savannah river got 127 million in salaries plus 35 
million in bonuses from the energy department the figures showed 
westinghouse savannah river co took over as operator april 1 
moore told the committee the top westinghouse executives are paid 
less than were the du pont managers and all top westinghouse 
managers are at the plant 
moore did not provide exact figures for westinghouse salaries or 
bonuses

one side effect of the us inability to 
dislodge panamas gen manuel antonio noriega is a highly unusual 
public spat between two influential former officials over who is to 
blame for the panama policy failure 
the fingerpointing mudslinging and mutual recriminations 
carried out recently in prominent newspapers are a departure from 
the normal practice of policymakers who disagree such disputes 
usually are kept private but the feelings on the panama situation 
run deeply 
in one corner in this conflict is the reagan administrations 
top diplomat for latin america elliott abrams and in the other is 
the recently retired chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm 
william j crowe jr they have decided to take the gloves off 
the hawkish abrams 41 quit government service in january the 
more dovish crowe 64 joined the military six years before abrams 
was born 
both have impressive educational backgrounds and relish 
intellectual combat but beyond that the similarities between them 
are few aside from their political differences abrams is a 
relative bantam while crowe is a 6foottall 200pounder 
their dispute over panama boils down to how far the united 
states should have gone last year in its efforts to remove noriega 
a question that has been revived following the failed coup attempt 
against noriega three weeks ago 
abrams fired the first salvo against crowe two days after the 
abortive coup attempt complaining in a new york times column that 
crowe and the joint chiefs used adamant pressure to reject 
proposals for vigorous action against noriega last year 
these and other allegations prompted crowe to rebut in a letter 
to the times that abrams was both naive and reckless in his 
advocacy of the use of military force in panama 
crowe suggested that such attitudes are not uncommon among 
young political appointees who have never served in uniform 
in a telephone interview this week abrams rejected crowes 
suggestion that abrams was alone in the push for a more pugnacious 
stand against noriega 
they were not my positions they were the state 
departments he said as for the notion that reckless military 
action is often the option favored by those who have never seen 
active duty abrams replied that a military move in panama was 
urged by his boss a wellknown marine combat veteran former 
secretary of state george p shultz 
crowe did not return a reporters phone call this week but said 
in his letter to the times that abrams was wrong from the start 
about panama 
abrams crowe wrote offered assurances that the mere threat of 
economic sanctions against panama would oust noriega 
he then argued with great confidence that actually imposing 
sanctions would bring the general to his knees in two weeks we 
tried that and it didnt work either crowe wrote 
abrams denied that he suggested that economic sanctions would 
ever be sufficient to bring down noriega 
he also suggested that crowe attempted to influence public 
opinion with newspaper leaks designed to discredit the options 
abrams was advocating on behalf of the state department 
in a country that adheres to the principle of civilian 
supremacy abrams said such activity by a uniformed officer is 
pernicious 
crowe meanwhile told the new york times this week that abrams 
had been badmouthing me all over town saying isnt it sort of 
weird that the jcs are wimps and things like that 
i was getting a little bit tired of elliott now that im free 
to talk i felt i should throw down the gauntlet crowe said

environmentalists are giving national park 
service director james ridenour high marks for refusing to allow a 
lumber company to haul timber from national forests through 
yellowstone park 
i think the park service is to be commended michael scott 
of the wilderness society said tuesday it did the right thing 
ridenour rejected a us forest service argument that an 
economic emergency justified the route 
it would have set a very serious precedent scott said 
contending that private owners would have made similar requests if 
the forest service had prevailed 
ridenour denied the request on the advice of lawyers who said it 
violated federal regulations that prohibit commercial transport 
across park roadways said park service spokesman george berklacy 
ridenour berklacy said was concerned that the plan to move 
about 20000 truckloads of logs through the park would have adverse 
impact on important grizzly bear elk and bison habitats as well as 
roadways 
the forest service sold the timber from national forests 
bordering yellowstone that were partially burned during colossal 
fires that swept through the park last year

powers of its chairman and chief executive sources say 
the sources said tuesday night the 45member board in a meeting 
scheduled for today may consider changes in the centers bylaws to 
ease ralph davidson out of some of his responsibilities as the 
daytoday administrator of the cultural center 
davidson is reported to have been the source of friction between 
some trustees in recent months 
the sources noted that the bylaws provide for a president a 
position vacant since the center opened in 1971 as the nations 
only official memorial to president john f kennedy 
the washington post reported today that 28 trustees said they 
dont want to renew davidsons contract which expires in january

his tenure the newspaper said 
davidson a former time inc executive was hired in february 
1988 to succeed broadway producer roger l stevens the first 
chairman stevens officially retired in august of this year after a 
long transition 
reports of davidsons difficulties surfaced after the boards 
last meeting three months ago one kennedy center source who spoke 
on condition of anonymity said davidson had come to believe 
differences over the future of the center were intractable the 
source didnt detail the differences 
the newspaper said differences concerned personality clashes and 
other matters not the artistic health of the center 
among the matters cited were davidsons reported failure to 
attend important parties how to pay for an upcoming trip to the 
soviet union by the national symphony orchestra and davidson being 
unreachable by british producer duncan weldon most likely losing 
the chance to mount weldons productions of shakespeares richard 
ii and richard iii 
harry mcpherson general counsel to the center declined to 
comment on the report the newspaper said davidson declined to

a smokeable drug called ice is a major 
problem in hawaii and could become a greater threat than cocaine 
officials say 
the ice problem is so bad that crack pales by comparison 
honolulu police chief douglas g gibb told a house panel tuesday 
ice is cheaper to produce gives users a very long steady high 
and is more addictive than heroin 
us attorney daniel bent told the house select committee on 
narcotics abuse and control i think we have an epidemic 
the hearing focused on the asianproduced crystalline form of 
methamphetamine that has hit hawaii and some cities on the west 
coast and on the reemergence of powdered methamphetamine known 
as crank speed and meth 
although ice is more expensive than cocaine selling for as much 
as 7000 for a full ounce drug users consider it more economical 
because it lasts longer bent said he and gibb said the high lasts 
four to 14 hours 
san diego police chief bob burgreen said regular methamphetamine 
which can be smoked and provides the same high as ice according 
to experts can be produced for about 1000 a pound and sold in 
bulk for 5000 a pound on the street burgreen said oneeighth 
of an ounce can sell for as much as 200 
he said the process to transform regular methamphetamine into 
the popular and more expensive ice is relatively simple 
ice is odorless and can be smoked in public with little danger 
of detection gibb said this factor as well as the 
longlasting high and the ready availability of the drug have made 
it the drug of choice for onthejob use in honolulu 
the increase in the drugs popularity is evident not only in the 
increase in arrests the caseload is up 75 percent over last year 
and there are two ice cases for every cocaine case but also in 
hospital admissions he said 
last year one of honolulus major hospitals averaged one ice 
overdose a day this year there have been half a dozen a day 
gibb said 
since 1985 he said 32 deaths in honolulu have been attributed 
to ice while in the first six months of 1989 there were eight 
homicides and seven suicides connected to the drug

a car bomb exploded in the resort city 
of cartagena just hours after the government pledged to resist a 
terror campaign and keep extraditing suspected drug traffickers to 
the united states 
the bomb went off late tuesday in the bocagrande section of the 
city near the barlovento hotel injuring two people and causing 
extensive damage the radio network caracol reported the hotel is 
popular with us tourists 
sixteen people have been killed and 201 injured in bombings 
blamed on drug gangs since midaugust when the government launched 
its antidrug campaign and cocaine barons reciprocated with a 
declaration of war 
the state council a panel of top government leaders said 
tuesday that an emergency decree issued aug 19 by president 
virgilio barco allowing extradition to the united states would 
continue to be applied 
the council also said it has no intention of entering 
negotiations with traffickers as some have proposed 
barco issued the extradition decree after assassins shot to 
death a leading presidential candidate colombias previous 
extradition treaty with the united states had been struck down in 
the courts 
also tuesday the bodyguard of a manager for the antidrug 
crusading newspaper el espectador was fatally shot in western 
medellin police said the victim pedro luis osorio was a member 
of the medellin police force 
osorio was walking to meet a friend for lunch when two men 
approached him on a motorcycle and opened fire a medellin police 
spokesman said by telephone after killing the bodyguard police 
said the assassins chased down and murdered his friend maria 
ortega five blocks away 
the spokesman said the murders resulted from a personal dispute 
however hours after the killings a man claiming to speak for 
drug traffickers said in an anonymous phone call that the remaining 
11 el espectador workers in medellin would be killed if the paper 
does not close its bureau in the city home of the countrys most 
powerful cocaine cartel 
the bodyguard had been assigned to protect luis bejarano who 
replaced one of the two el espectador employees killed by gunmen in 
medellin on oct 10 
the state council composed of the president the chief of 
police intelligence the attorney general and the ministers of 
defense interior and justice issued its announcement on the 
extraditions following speculation that the supreme court had 
struck down possible extraditions 
in rejecting negotiations with the drug cartels the council 
said the government has undertaken a policy of combating drug 
trafficking and its criminal organizations and nowhere in this 
campaign is there room for either a dialogue or negotiations with 
traffickers 
a message from drug traffickers published by the bogota 
newspaper el tiempo on wednesday had asked for talks with the 
government to end extraditions if the cocaine bosses agree to 
abandon all drug trafficking in colombia 
under barcos decree the government has extradited four people 
to the united states 
although government forces have seized millions of dollars in 
alleged assets of drug traffickers since midaugust they have yet 
to capture any of the top cocaine bosses wanted by the united 
states

buried in the mudslide but survivors at the scene said about 400 
people lived in the slum neighborhood 
geraldo jacob of the public works department said some houses 
were buried under at least 45 feet of dirt

john poindexters daily meetings with 
president reagan on irancontra may entitle the former national 
security adviser to subpoena some of the expresidents notes and 
diaries a federal judge says 
us district court judge harold greene on tuesday gave 
poindexter the goahead to seek relevant documents from reagan 
he set jan 22 for poindexters trial on charges of conspiracy 
making false statements and obstructing congress in the irancontra 
affair 
greene said poindexter will assert in his defense that his 
activities were authorized by reagan contentions that suggest that 
reagan was far more deeply involved in details of the irancontra 
scandal than he has acknowledged 
greene rejected a request by poindexter for permission to 
subpoena notes of thenvice president bush saying poindexter 
failed to show that bush might have authorized his activities but 
the judge held open the possibility that poindexter might be 
allowed to seek documents from bush later if he can show a more 
pressing need 
if the claims by poindexter are correct there is a 
sufficient likelihood that the documents sought from president 
reagan would be material to the poindexter defense the judge 
said 
if the defendant submits subpoenas for specific 
relevant documents in the custody of former president reagan or 
the national archives the court will authorize their issuance 
greene said 
reagan would have to produce any subpoenaed documents by nov 
23 but such a subpoena could invoke a claim of executive 
privilege theodore olson a lawyer for the former president 
declined to comment 
us district court judge gerhard gesell quashed subpoenas for 
testimony from reagan and bush in the trial of oliver north the 
former white house aide who worked under poindexter 
poindexter greene said contends that reagan met with him 
daily frequently alone and that they routinely discussed 
such matters as the role of richard secord as a middleman in the 
transfer of arms to iran 
poindexter maintains in sealed papers that reagan was briefed 
about a false chronology of the administrations arms sales to iran 
involving four of the criminal charges against poindexter 
the chronology stated that no one in the us government knew 
before january 1986 that a november 1985 shipment to iran contained 
hawk missiles the cia assisted the shipment without a signed 
presidential finding as required by law 
poindexter asserts that reagan on the inaccurate chronology and 
other matters either formulated the administrations position 
or entertained poindexters plans without voicing any objection 
it appears that notes were taken by the president and others 
on these conversations and according to the defendant these notes 
or presidential diary entries would support his defense to the 
charges greene said 
poindexter contends that he and reagan discussed the 
administrations view of a contemplated house committee inquiry 
into the thensecret contra resupply program operated by north 
poindexter is charged with obstructing congress by encouraging 
north to lie in an aug 6 1986 meeting with members of congress 
about assisting the contras after the meeting in which north 
denied aiding the rebels the proposed resolution of inquiry was 
shelved 
poindexter sent a well done message to north after the aug 
6 meeting 
greene also said poindexter maintains he discussed frequently 
with reagan the depth of the administrations commitment to the 
contras and its desire to continue to provide military support to 
them

a swarm of 40 earthquakes struck the 
yellowstone national park area but only two were strong enough to 
be felt geologists said 
the quakes began at 116 pm mdt tuesday and were recorded 
during the next nine hours said walter nagy who monitors 
yellowstone seismic activity for the university of utah seismograph 
stations 
the quakes included two of magnitude 35 on the richter scale of 
ground movement at 935 pm and 936 pm these were large enough 
to be felt locally he said 
the quakes were six miles north of west yellowstone mont 
along the western boundary of the park 
they struck within five miles of an extensive swarm sequence in 
1985 which included 28 quakes of magnitude 35 or greater nagy 
said 
he said tuesdays quakes were at the eastern end of the rupture 
zone of the magnitude 75 hebgen quake on aug 17 1959 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area a 7 reading is a major earthquake 
capable of widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable 
of tremendous damage 
the oct 17 san francisco bay area quake measured 71 on the 
richter scale

the joffrey ballet season at the city center 
opened with what was intended to be a salute to vaudeville but the 
650000 40minute entertainment isnt ballet and it isnt a 
thoroughgoing giggle to watch either 
the pantages and the palace present twoaday was seen 
tuesday night at the start of a season that runs through nov 19 
after paul taylors arden court in which dancers looked 
bright and sparkling gerald arpinos duet sea shadow and the 
new york premiere of twoaday a roaring 20s supper ball 
was held at roseland 
this was appropriate since some of twoaday looked more 
like a glitzy production of the boy friend the 1954 musical 
about the 20s than like vaudeville 
arpino was inspired to create twoaday by theaters which 
alternated movies and live stage shows he began with a color film 
recreating the ending of the first a star is born then 
presumably the audience saw the dance part of the live show 
the program explained who inspired each of eight scenes sally 
rand is named for the first les plumes with 15 women running 
around waving big pink and white fans it looked more as though 
busby berkeley was its inspiration 
there isnt much dancing in twoaday but there are a lot 
of men carrying women aloft and a lot of just running around the 
stage six men with top hats and canes were listed as tapdancing 
they did a few novelty steps and one expertly twirled his cane like 
a baton 
in more extreme novelty kathryn ginden wafted about two long 
pieces of silk with her arms and poles she held in her hands 
bathing beauties in middy tops and shorts formed a kick line 
a persian couple seemed like a chance for a dance but mostly 
tom mossbrucker carried julie janus over his head 
six couples spoofing spanish dancing was close to camp it was 
the liveliest scene and probably the best 
a girl with bobbed hair arrived from above seated on a moon 
amid swooning men and was carried around by them before departing 
skyward the mild finale was meant to be a group charleston 
most of the music was composed by rebekah harkness 
twoaday was commissioned by david h murdock to honor the 
office of the president it was underwritten by murdock and the 
harkness foundation for dance the premiere was oct 10 at kennedy 
center in washington 
we wouldnt really want to see twoaday again maybe there 
should have been a couple of comics and a trained dog

kidnappers holding at least two americans 
have again issued their demand for the release of 15 shiite moslem 
comrades jailed in kuwait for bombing the us and french embassies 
a statement from islamic jihad or islamic holy war was 
delivered tuesday to the independent newspaper annahar and a 
western news agency in beirut 
the agencys copy was accompanied by an instant photograph of 
american hostage terry anderson who has been held the longest of 
the 18 western hostages anderson abducted march 16 1985 is 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
we renew our firm emphasis on the need to free our struggling 
brethren from the jails of the collaborating kuwaiti regime and 
declare that the mujahedeen holy warriors shall not rest until 
they see their brethren free said the statement typewritten in 
arabic 
the photograph of anderson was similar to one released by 
islamic jihad on nov 4 1988 with the last statement from the 
group showing anderson about to cut a birthday cake 
no cake was visible in the latest picture a closeup from a 
slightly different angle that shows anderson from the waist up 
mustachioed and smiling wearing glasses and a yellow tshirt in 
the background is what appears to be the same blue curtain 
anderson turns 42 on friday it will be his fifth birthday in 
captivity 
islamic jihad also holds thomas sutherland 57 of fort collins 
colo who was acting dean of agriculture at american university of 
beirut when he was abducted june 9 1985 
the shiite moslems in kuwait were convicted on terrorist charges 
stemming from the 1983 embassy bombings in which at least five 
people were killed and 86 wounded three have been condemned to 
death but the sentences have not been carried out kuwait has 
refused previous demands to release the prisoners 
with the statement delivered to annahar were two pictures of 
the us marine base and the french paratroop headquarters in 
beirut that were attacked with truck bombs oct 23 1983 
islamic jihad said it issued the statement to mark the 
anniversary of the bombings which killed 241 american military 
personnel and 58 french soldiers 
like most other lebanese factions claiming to hold western 
hostages in lebanon islamic jihad is believed to be a group of 
shiite zealots loyal to iran 
president hashemi rafsanjani of iran offered monday to help 
secure the hostages release if the united states releases frozen 
iranian assets or helps determine the fate of three iranians now 
believed dead kidnapped in lebanon in 1982

republican army bombing says police harassed him at gunpoint in 
belfast after his release 
legislators jeremy corbyn and chris mullin of britains 
opposition labor party said today they will question prime minister 
margaret thatchers government in parliament about gerard conlons 
allegation

which he and family members were traveling tuesday 
police checked the identity papers of the people in the taxi 
the report said then searched conlon a belfast roman catholic at 
gunpoint 
guns were pointed at him and one officer turned and 
shouted to a group of others this is conlon the report said 
the royal ulster constabulary northern irelands predominantly 
protestant police force said in a statement that if conlon made an 
official complaint it would be investigated 
conlon earlier told reporters after 15 years in prison 
havent they done enough to me and my family 
searches by armed police are commonplace in northern ireland but 
critics allege they are sometimes carried out to harass members of 
the minority catholic community 
conlon returned to belfast after thursdays ruling in london by 
lord lane the countrys secondranking judge that he and the 
other three members of the socalled guildford four were wrongly 
convicted

that police officers probably lied to get the four convictions he 
also reversed the convictions of armstrong and hill for an ira 
bombing at a tavern in the london suburb of woolwich on nov 6 
1974 two people died in that blast 
the government has ordered an inquiry into alleged police

jim berkland moonlights as an earthquake 
prophet using theories based on lost pets and lunar tides but it 
may have cost him his job as geologist for the santa clara county 
planning department 
berkland complained tuesday that he got a bad rap after he 
predicted the deadly 71magnitude quake that killed dozens 
injured thousands and caused more than 71 billion in damage 
berklands boss planning director leode franklin said she put 
him on administrative leave because his reported claims of another 
major quake in the bay area in november were generating 
unwarranted fear 
berkland 59 contends he predicted nothing more than a 35 to 
55magnitude quake between nov 11 and nov 18 
this is a fantastic situation when i get accused of something 
i didnt do berkland said in a telephone interview from his san 
jose area home 
the geologist said he has been predicting temblors for 15 years 
by studying tides the movement of the sun and the moon and the 
disoriented behavior of dogs cats birds and other animals 
immediately before an earthquake 
he said one clue is the large number of lost animal 
advertisements printed in papers a week or two before an earthquake 
berkland theorizes that animals are far more sensitive than 
people to changes in magnetic fields known to occur before quakes 
and when they get disoriented they lose their sense of direction 
berkland said his unorthodox methods have generated ridicule 
over the years he got wide attention after the oct 17 quake 
because hed said four days earlier that a quake measuring up to 6 
on the richter scale was about to hit 
ms franklin said berkland was hired by the county to assess 
geologic conditions for land use approvals in unincorporated areas 
my real concern is the public as a whole sees him as a county 
official she said adding that his hobby has interfered with 
legitimate geologic assessments 
if santa clara county wants information on potential quakes ms 
franklin said it will rely on the state office of emergency 
services and the us geologic survey on tuesday the usgs said 
there was a 5050 chance of a major aftershock by christmas 
the usgs based its prediction on statistical data from other 
quakes in the area and on geologists observations of the san 
andreas fault the agency has disputed berklands methods 
bill bakun of the usgs said people can do just as well by 
flipping a coin and be as successful as jim berkland in 
forecasting temblors 
berkland claimed that hes been right on 240 of the 300 quakes 
he has predicted during the past 15 years

government agents in at least two dozen countries 
illegally killed tens of thousands of people in 1988 and more than 
half the worlds governments tortured or mistreated prisoners 
amnesty international said today 
the londonbased human rights group said in its annual global 
survey that human rights were violated in 133 countries last year 
the violations ranged from death squad killings in latin america to 
harassment of church groups in china and mistreatment of jailed 
aborigines in australia 
the 310page report said the victims of deliberate illegal 
killings in at least two dozen countries were government opponents 
members of ethnic or religious groups and civilians living in areas 
of military operations 
it said the victims were gunned down in groups or shot by 
snipers blown up by explosives stabbed strangled hacked to 
death or poisoned many were tortured to death 
onethird of the worlds governments jailed prisoners of 
conscience defined by amnesty as people locked up for the 
nonviolent exercise of their human rights the group said 
and it accused more than half the governments of either 
torturing or mistreating prisoners 
also 1903 prisoners were executed under death penalty laws in 
35 countries in 1988 the highest number of such executions since 
1981 the report said amnesty winner of the 1977 nobel peace 
prize opposes capital punishment in all circumstances 
the report was written before many of the sweeping democratic 
reforms in eastern europe and the soviet union 
an accompanying summary touched only briefly on the june killing 
of hundreds of unarmed civilians in beijing by chinese troops as 
the government moved to crush the studentled prodemocracy 
movement 
in colombia guatemala el salvador syria and the philippines 
victims of illegal killings were often severely mutilated before 
being killed the report said 
it called those killings and the killing of hundreds of 
civilians by sri lankas security forces striking examples of 
continuing extrajudicial executions this year 
it said governments made enormous efforts to conceal 
evidence of such killings but details were reaching the 
international community more rapidly than ever before 
killings are carried out at night when the victims are alone 
or in remote rural areas where even largescale troop movements can 
be undertaken unobserved the report said 
in urban areas specialized squads are trained to function in 
secrecy and are authorized to conduct operations in areas under 
curfew and police control 
amnesty said many such killings occurred during armed conflict 
in countries including afghanistan ethiopia and burma 
warfare makes it easier to evade accountability not only is 
access by independent observers limited but the dead can be 
characterized as combatants or as the unavoidable civilian 
casualties of war the report said 
amnesty said many people became victims simply because they 
lived in areas where the overall population was seen as the enemy 
it said iraqi forces attacked the kurdish population with 
chemical weapons deliberately killing some 5000 men women and 
children in halabja survivors of chemical attacks were often 
summarily executed and in villages near the town of duhok more 
than 1000 executions in one day were reported it said 
many killings occurred during or after antigovernment 
demonstrations amnesty said it expressed concern about the 
israelioccupied territories where more than 300 palestinian 
civilians were killed in 1988 algeria where at least 176 
demonstrators died and tibet where chinese police killed dozens 
of proindependence demonstrators 
amnesty said it documented prisoners of conscience in at least 
76 countries in 1988 
among the worst offenders cited were turkey where thousands 
were detained for political reasons including hundreds of 
prisoners of conscience and greece where conscientious objectors 
to military service were in prison 
however 1566 prisoners of conscience were released worldwide 
during 1988 or one in every three cases taken up by amnesty more 
than half the 300 known prisoners of conscience in the soviet union 
in january 1988 were released by the end of the year 
detainees were held without charge or trial in more than 75 
countries and torture and illtreatment was reported in 94 it 
said

the disorganized coup in panama was 
muddled by confusion and mixed feelings among officers about the 
leader they sought to overthrow said the highestranking survivor 
of the attempt 
capt javier licona escaped the killings and arrests that 
followed the collapse of the oct 3 coup because he had been sent 
to fort clayton during the operation to ask why us troops hadnt 
cut off roads or buzzed airports to block loyalists of panamanian 
leader gen manuel antonio noriega 
when the coup began to crumble licona remained at fort clayton 
the us base in panama and eventually was flown with other 
refugees to the united states 
licona 36 talked to reporters tuesday for the first time since 
the failed coup he had declined to speak publicly while he 
arranged for relatives to join him and was interviewed by us 
officials 
licona said the coups leader maj moises giroldi told him 
us support was promised at a secret meeting the night of oct 1 
but when i arrived at fort clayton general cisneros knew 
nothing of the support they were supposed to give us licona 
said maj gen marc cisneros is the top us army official in 
panama 
after a 20minute phone call with someone cisneros gave the 
order to block the roads licona said 
panamanian military planes had already left to transport in 
the troops to support general noriega it was too late licona 
said 
having seized noriega during the coup attempt giroldi seemed 
unsure about what to do with him licona said 
he remained under noriegas influence he had been very 
loyal to the general licona said giroldi wanted noriega to 
leave power peacefully but said he could remain in panama licona 
said 
licona said giroldi failed to make a clear agreement with maj 
federico oleochea leader of the strongest unit in the capital 
battalion 2000 
he told me he was sure major oleochea would support us the 
moment he asked but he never spoke wwith him concretely about what 
he wanted i never trusted oleochea he said 
oleochea eventually joined noriega in crushing the coup licona 
said giroldi was slain

abandoned cats free to anyone who will prove a good home for them 
problem is these felines grow to 150 pounds 
vernon yates has accumulated eight cougars at his wildlife 
rescue and rehabilitation complex and hes having trouble giving 
them away 
i have a very hard time placing cougars everybody does he 
said 
he wound up with the big cats as part of his job trapping and 
housing unwanted exotic animals 
they make good pets if you understand what youre dealing 
with yates said they have the potential to severely hurt 
somebody and in the case of a small child kill them 
pet shops sold exotic cats until a couple years ago when 
stricter state laws were enacted anybody could walk into a pet 
shop lay down 1000 and walk off with a cat said yates 
now to get a permit to own an exotic cat the state requires 
three years of animal handling experience and a cage that meets 
certain specifications 
some people say that living in a cage isnt necessarily the 
best life for a cougar yates said but its someplace to go 
im trying to keep them from being destroyed 
i believe there are people out there who will love them even 
though they cant pet them

workers prepared atlantis 
for a weekend piggyback ride on a jet to florida after finding the 
shuttle sustained very little damage to its heatshield tiles 
during its latest space flight 
everythings going smooth were on schedule to depart on 
saturday morning said lisa malone spokeswoman for the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
atlantis today sat inside a 100foottall steel structure named 
the matedemate device as workers prepared to mount it atop a 
modified boeing 747 jumbo jet for the return to kennedy space 
center 
plans now call for the jet to carry the shuttle to kelly air 
force base near san antonio for an overnight stop but there was a 
remote possibility the entire trip would be completed saturday 
said conrad nagel atlantis processing director 
atlantis landed at this mojave desert military base monday 
following a fiveday flight during which astronauts released the 
galileo spacecraft from the shuttles cargo bay for a looping 
sixyear voyage to jupiter 
initial inspection showed only 25 nicks caused by debris that 
hit the tiles most can be repaired and only six tiles will need to 
be replaced cindy lodge tile manager for the shuttle said 
tuesday 
no tiles were lost she said 
inspection of atlantis brakes showed they looked really 
good while the shuttles tires displayed only normal 
scuffing nagel said 
the mission was atlantis fifth and was the sixth flight for 
any shuttle since the jan 28 1986 explosion that destroyed 
challenger and killed its seven crew members 
the next flight of atlantis scheduled for feb 10 probably 
will be delayed by up to six days because of the sixday delay in 
launching the shuttle on the justcompleted flight nagel said 
atlantis is scheduled to perform a classified defense department 
mission in february 
two other shuttle flights are planned for this year 
discovery is scheduled for a nov 20 launch on a classified 
pentagon mission 
columbia scheduled for launch on a 10day mission dec 20 will 
place a navy communications satellite in orbit then attempt to 
retrieve the 15 million long duration exposure facility satellite 
which will fall into earths atmosphere in february unless it is 
plucked from its decaying orbit 
the satellite contains experiments related to the proposed 
star wars system to defend the united states against incoming 
warheads the experiments were meant to determine how materials 
that might be used in a star wars system will fare in the hostile 
environment of space 
the satellite launched by challenger in 1984 also contains 
millions of tomato seeds which will be planted on earth to learn 
how weightlessness affects the subsequent growth of the seeds

four of the 10 men killed in an 
explosion at a western kentucky mine were pulled from an area where 
dangerous methane levels had been detected four days earlier a 
state official said 
but the official testifying tuesday at a hearing on the sept 
13 explosion said the high concentration of the gas alone would 
not account for the blast which caused the worst us mine 
disaster since 1984 
interviews with workers at the william station mine indicated 
that tests showed the air in one part of the mine was 6 percent 
methane on sept 9 said the official state mining inspector billy 
smith 
methane is considered explosive at levels of 5 percent to 15 
percent 
workers hung additional fireproof curtains and tightened 
existing curtains to allow more air to flow into the mine and 
decrease the high methane level they also assigned a person to 
monitor the methane level while they worked in the area he said 
from what i can find out they warned oncoming crews they had 
detected methane smith said 
state investigators are considering several possible causes for 
the accumulation of methane including water that blocked the 
mines primary ventilation system and the absence of a regulator 
or curtain to control the flow of air through the mine 
workers were not required to use the regulator since mining in 
the section had been completed on sept 6 and the four workers who 
died in the area of high methane concentration were dismantling a 
longwall mining machine smith said 
the six other miners were working in another section 
the explosion may have been sparked by torches believed to have 
been in use before the explosion or by rock falls that may have 
caused electric cables to spark officials said 
ron siler president of pyro mining co said officials did not 
learn of the high methane level until after the explosion 
attorneys for widows of miners killed in the blast questioned 
state and company officials knew about a partition that was removed 
about 15 minutes before the explosion 
federal investigators have said tearing down the barrier may 
have altered the air flow in the mine allowing the explosive 
methane gas to accumulate 
smith testified however that the partition was about 5400 
feet away from the explosion area and was unlikely to have affected 
the level of methane in the blast area 
methane gas is given off as coal is mined smith said any 
accumulation of the gas usually clears out of an area within two 
days after mining ceases

amnesty international said today that a puerto 
rican nationalist in lengthy pretrial detention and a former black 
panther sentenced to life on a murder conviction may have been 
shortchanged by the us justice system 
in its annual global survey the human rights organization 
reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and said the 11 
prisoners executed in the united states last year raised the total 
since 1977 to 104 
the death row population grew to an unprecedented 2182 
prisoners in 34 states by the end of 1988 it said 
amnesty international raised concerns about filberto ojeda rios 
a puerto rican independence supporter held in pretrial detention 
in connecticut for 32 months on armed robbery charges 
a federal court ordered his release on bail in may 1988 saying 
due process cannot tolerate any further pretrial detention 
however he was arrested again three months later and charged 
with a new offense of assault relating to his original arrest in 
1985 ojeda rios was denied bail and again placed in detention 
amnesty said he was held in virtual incommunicado detention 
with only limited access to lawyers 
it expressed concern that ojeda rios lengthy pretrial 
detention may have undermined his right to be tried within a 
reasonable period or else be released 
the human rights group also said it asked gov george deukmejian 
of california to order an inquiry into the case of a former member 
of the black panther party serving a life sentence in california 
for a 1972 murder conviction 
elmer geronimo pratt may have been denied a fair trial 
because of his political activities amnesty said 
it said new evidence obtained after pratts trial indicated he 
was targeted for neutralization by the fbi between 1968 and 
1971 because of his political activities 
it said the evidence also revealed the chief prosecution witness 
was an fbi informant and that the fbi planted informers in pratts 
defense teams 
a 1985 court hearing dismissed pratts motion for a new trial 
ruling that the chief prosecution witness had been an fbi contact 
not an informer and that pratt had not suffered as a result of the 
surveillance on his defense team 
in june 1988 the ninth circuit court of appeal also turned down 
his appeal on technical grounds 
amnesty said deukmejian told them he was without the 
authority ability and resources to order an inquiry 
on other matters amnesty said it investigated reports that 
prisoners in several state prisons had been illtreated including 
the michael unit of the texas department of corrections where 
guards allegedly beat prisoners who were handcuffed and kept in leg 
irons 
the warden of michael unit informed amnesty that no such 
incidents had occurred the report said 
amnesty said it also looked into reports that prisoners in the 
administrative control unit of the southern ohio correctional 
facility were shackled and chained to cell fixtures others were 
alleged to have been sprayed with mace and highpressure water and 
left in empty unheated cells for several days 
prison authorities denied that prisoners had been illtreated 
but admitted that shackles chains and mace were used for 
restraining purposes amnesty said 
the international human rights organization said it also 
concluded that conditions in the high security unit of kentuckys 
lexington federal prison were substandard the unit has since been 
closed

the 82yearold lawyer who represented 
jim bakker through much of his fraud and conspiracy trial doesnt 
expect to be paid soon by the ptl founder but relishes the 
publicity 
every case ive ever had has been a heartstopper said 
george t davis who has been practicing law for more than five 
decades those are the only kinds of cases i take 
davis gained reknown representing legendary labor leader tom 
mooney and since has represented accused nazi war criminals 
political prisoners death row inmates and deposed foreign leaders 
he arrived in san francisco on tuesday to represent rudy tham a 
convicted teamster embezzler who allegedly conspired with us 
district judge robert aguilar to gain a reversal of his conviction 
aguilar has been charged with using his san jose calif 
judicial office in a racketeering enterprise in only the fourth 
indictment to be returned against a federal judge this decade and 
the first time the racketeering influence corrupt organizations 
act has been used against a federal judge 
davis who sparred with us district judge robert potter 
throughout bakkers trial said bakker had released him from 
serving as his attorney during the sentencing 
asked if bakker had paid him davis said how can i describe 
my compensation he assures me that some day it will be taken 
care of 
davis said bakker had been unfairly convicted 
this case was tried in a lynch mob orientation davis said 
in a telephone interview the only difference between an old 
fashioned southern lynching and this one is that the victim is 
still alive 
the case that sealed davis reputation at the age of 32 was 
his appeal on behalf of labor organizer mooney convicted of a 1916 
bombing in san francisco 
it was widely believed that mooney had been framed and when he 
was pardoned in 1939 thousands cheered as mooney and davis paraded 
through san francisco

the soviet union could play an 
important role in helping to initiate talks between south africas 
white government and its black adversaries state radio said today 
the south african broadcasting corp in a commentary said the 
soviet union was the only major power with influence over the 
african national congress guerrilla movement 
the anc has said it will neither halt its use of violence nor 
enter negotiations until the government legalizes it frees all 
political prisoners ends the 40monthold state of emergency and 
lifts restrictions on opposition activity the government says the 
anc is welcome to enter negotiations if it commits itself to 
peaceful solutions 
while it must be stressed that the soviet union will 
remain the main supplier of weapons to the anc as long as it 
decides to continue its program of violence the soviet union is 
nevertheless now publicly urging the anc to take part in a 
political or negotiated settlement the radio commentary said 
there is a clear need for all sides to concentrate less on 
preconditions and to get down to initial talks about the 
negotiations that they must eventually take part in the 
commentary said the soviet union could play an important role as 
a facilitator in working with other parties to loosen the current 
logjam 
president fw de klerk has offered to negotiate a new 
constitution which would extend political rights to the black 
majority although he envisions a system in which whites would 
retain veto power over major decisions 
in a series of steps aimed at promoting talks de klerk has 
eased restrictions on mass protests conferred with antiapartheid 
activists and freed unconditionally eight longterm political 
prisoners including seven anc leaders 
the freed anc men have spoken forthrightly in support of their 
organization including its use of violence and they are to 
address a governmentapproved mass rally sunday nevertheless law 
and order minister adriaan vlok has denied the anc has been tacitly 
legalized 
the anc will remain banned as long as it refuses to commit 
itself to peaceful development vlok said tuesday the south 
african police will continue to stop the organization in its 
tracks 
andries treurnicht leader of the farright conservative party 
said in a speech tuesday night that the government was obsessed 
with the concept of negotiation at the expense of white 
sovereignty 
de klerks national party insults our nationality and chases 
us up the path of black domination under the flag of consensus and 
reconciliation said treurnicht whose party won 31 percent of 
the white vote in parliamentary elections last month 
we will rather make do with a smaller white area than with one 
under an anc government he said

returned home after the verdict was given until dec 29 to 
complete the jail sentence 
she also was ordered to be interviewed by a psychiatrist and to 
refrain from driving until she gets her real age on her drivers 
license during the trial miss gabor claimed the license was 
stolen and altered by someone else 
the judge repeatedly attacked miss gabors demeanor inside and 
outside of court saying she was milking this case for 
publicity at the expense of the taxpayers who paid for the trial 
she has demonstrated an attitude continually of contempt for 
law and order and these proceedings without a hint of remorse or 
contrition of any kind the judge said and that is very 
relevant to sentencing 
as miss gabor left the courtroom she disputed the judges 
contention that she not only slapped a police officer but the 
american people by her statements out of court that the united 
states was worse than the soviet union or nazi germany 
im a very good american i love america she said why 
should i slap the face of america 
miss gabor star of such bfilms as queen of outer space and 
picture mommy dead faced a maximum of 18 months in jail and 
the judge warned that she could get more jail time if she violated 
her parole

after he stopped her rollsroyce convertible the actress testified 
she instinctively struck kramer after he roughed her up kramer 
overreacted she said and used undue force in arresting her 
besides the alcohol offense a jury convicted miss gabor on 
sept 29 of battery on a police officer and driving without a valid 
drivers license she was acquitted of failing to obey an officer 
all the charges were misdemeanors 
when she was first convicted we felt that the police 
department and officer kramer were vindicated said lt robert 
curtis a police spokesman we certainly feel that this 
sentence is even further vindication 
the trial drew more than 100 reporters camera crews and 
photographers from throughout the world 
the sentencing attracted a zsa zsa gabor lookalike a man who 
wrote a poem for the trial several people wearing fry zsa zsa 
buttons a man with john 316 on a tshirt and numerous 
tourists with pocket cameras 
after the sentencing a threepiece band played a drum roll as 
von anhalt walked down the court steps then later played a song 
written for the trial with lyrics that included zsa zsa shes 
going to jail shes paying some fines now

president mikhail s gorbachev and other top 
communists would have to campaign for their parliamentary seats in 
local districts in 1994 much as the british prime minister does 
if the legislature gets its way 
the constitutional change throwing all seats in parliament up 
for popular election was approved by the supreme soviet tuesday in 
a 254to85 vote however it must be confirmed by the 
legislatures parent body the congress of peoples deputies which 
meets at the end of the year 
the change part of a package of constitutional amendments 
approved tuesday denies the communist party and other special 
interests their guaranteed seats 
last years political reform allocated 100 seats to the 
communist party which filled them by allowing the leadership to 
select just 100 candidates 
that allowed gorbachev and most of the ruling politburo to be 
seated in congress without facing a public vote of confidence 
the supreme soviet the 542member fulltime legislature did 
not require gorbachev to mount a national campaign to win 
reelection to the presidency although some deputies had suggested 
a direct election that post will continue to be filled by the 
congress from among its members 
the decision by no means restricts the communist party from 
running candidates for geographical seats currently 80 percent of 
the 2250 deputies are communist party members 
last years political reform gave soviet voters their first real 
selection of candidates but the election system was complex and 
many people complained that the process was undemocratic and 
favored the status quo 
twothirds of the 2250 deputies in the congress were elected 
from geographical districts the other onethird were elected by 
social organizations and the reform package promised 100 seats 
each to the communist party the official trade unions and 
cooperative organizations 
the package allocated 75 seats each to the komsomol communist 
youth league to creative unions and to groups of women academics 
and veterans 
the last 75 were split among smaller groups with one seat even 
going to an association of stamp collectors 
progressives complained that the system violated the principle 
of one person one vote they said members of these organizations 
had the opportunity to vote in each group as well as in their 
geographical district 
in practice key reform groups such as the baltic peoples 
fronts and groups of new private business cooperatives were shut 
out of the privileged group in favor of longstanding agricultural 
cooperatives and organizations controlled by the communist party 
in one case however the prestigious academy of sciences capped 
a stormy series of elections by choosing a slate of reformers that 
included human rights activist andrei sakharov 
the supreme soviet also decided monday to allow the republics of 
the soviet union to make their own decisions on whether their 
presidents will be elected directly by the public or by their 
legislatures 
although the congress is supposed to handle final approval of 
constitutional amendments the legislators speeded up their vote 
because a number of the republics are scheduled to adopt new 
election laws this week that depend on the national amendments the 
official tass news agency said

while applauding the soviet admissions of past 
mistakes some bush administration officials are concerned that the 
kremlin may be engaged in a sophisticated campaign to weaken us 
resolve on key foreign and defense policies 
the administrations public response tuesday to the speech by 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze was decidedly 
favorable with spokesmen using words such as extraordinary and 
striking to describe the soviet diplomats statements 
in a speech monday shevardnadze condemned the soviet invasion 
of afghanistan in 1979 and in effect said the united states was 
correct in contending that a controversial radar station in siberia 
violated bilateral agreements 
but one us official speaking anonymously said shevardnadzes 
statements on afghanistan may have been aimed at rallying us 
public opinion against continued us military involvement in 
afghanistan 
the united states has been providing substantial assistance to 
the afghan rebels and encouraging them not to enter peace 
negotiations with the promoscow regime in kabul 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler welcomed 
shevardnadzes admission that the invasion had set the soviet union 
against all of humanity but she added that the kremlin should 
do more to erase its mistakes 
specifically she encouraged the soviets to transfer power from 
the illegitimate government in afghanistan to a government 
acceptable to all the afghan people 
the legacy of the soviet invasion continues as long as the 
current kabul regime retains power in the face of a determined 
effort by the afghan people and the international community to see 
it removed she said 
the afghan war has continued to rage even though the soviets 
completed their troop pullout eight months ago 
according to us estimates the soviets have been airlifting 
250 million to 300 million worth of arms a month to kabul soviet 
military involvement in afghanistan among other regional 
conflicts was perhaps the main area of disagreement during 
shevardnadzes talks last month with secretary of state james a 
baker iii in wyoming 
the administration was clearly elated over shevardnadzes 
remarks on the krasnoyarsk radar site 
ms tutwiler said we have long maintained that the radar is a 
violation of the abm treaty we therefore welcome mr 
shevardnadzes statement just as we welcomed the soviet decision in 
september to completely eliminate that radar 
other officials insisting on anonymity expressed concern that 
the soviets might try to parlay their mea culpas over the radar 
issue into a campaign aimed at reversing us public support for 
the strategic defense initiative 
former defense secretary caspar weinberger said in a television 
interview today that the speech was almost certainly aimed at 
giving the soviets leverage against the spacebased missile defense 
system 
one of the motives i am sure is to make it more difficult 
for us to withdraw from the abm treaty which we should do 
weinberger said on abcs good morning america program and 
so this is part of the soviet pattern of trying to prevent us from 
proceeding with president reagans strategic defense initiative 
the united states had argued that the soviets could have 
utilized the krasnoyarsk radar to develop a first strike capability 
against us targets the soviets have used the same argument in 
opposing sdi 
one official said shevardnadzes statements on the krasnoyarsk 
site have immense propaganda potential if they weaken us 
resolve to push ahead with the sdi program 
the official added he believes it is essential for the united 
states to proceed with the program contending that the soviets 
themselves have their own sdi project under way 
still the administration seemed pleased at the overall tone of 
shevardnadzes remarks and suggested that they bode well for the 
future 
theyre extraordinary said white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater he called shevardnadzes candor a step in the right 
direction for arms control 
ms tutwiler called shevardnadzes statements strikingly 
forthright admissions of past soviet mistakes 
they reflect new thinking and they demonstrate the soviet 
acknowledgement of the importance of being honest about past soviet 
policy she said

a senior california transportation 
engineer told a seismic workshop four years ago there was no need 
to strengthen freeway columns until future earthquakes proved them 
vulnerable state documents show 
ray j zelinski head of the freeway retrofitting program for 
the state department of transportation said the strengthening 
wasnt necessary because the states project to tie roadbeds 
together with steel cables provided enough stability in an 
earthquake according to the documents released monday by the 
department 
some structural engineers have criticized californias 
transportation department for not strengthening the columns on 
oaklands doubledecked nimitz freeway which collapsed during the 
oct 17 earthquake killing more than three dozen people the 
freeways roadbeds were tied together 
the cause of the collapse is still undetermined however 
it should be noted zelinski said in a paper delivered at 
the 1985 workshop in new zealand that column retrofits have been 
avoided by designing restraining features in a manner which 
circumvents collapse due to column damage 
review of behavior of retrofitted bridges during earthquakes 
will determine whether features will need improvement and whether 
columns need to be considered for retrofitting he said 
zelinski has been ordered by state transportation officials and 
attorneys not to comment on his earlier remarks 
however james e roberts chief of caltrans structures 
division said zelinski still believes the roadbed tiedown system 
should be enough to prevent failures although the freeways 
collapse shakes his faith a little 
roberts said he thought the tiedown project has been highly 
effective 
the states program to strengthen columns through retrofitting 
also may have been delayed in part because zelinski and other 
engineers did not believe it was necessary said roberts that 
tells you about why we havent seen the need to move faster 
also tuesday a former state bridge designer charged that the 
nimitz freeway which opened in 1957 was not built to the highest 
standards of the time 
jim see who is now the public works director for the city of 
pleasant hill said the freeways columns were not sufficiently 
reinforced with horizontal steel supports 
roberts said his staff is investigating sees allegations

novelist salman rushdie denied a newspapers claim 
that he misled his publisher about the likely impact his novel 
the satanic verses would have on the moslem world 
in a letter published today in the independent rushdie accuses 
the daily of telling a blatant untruth in a profile it 
published saturday of peter mayer head of viking penguin 
publishers 
rushdie has been in hiding for eight months since the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called on moslems to kill him for 
allegedly blaspheming their faith 
the threat also extends to rushdies publishers and the 
independents profile said mayer has been forced to spend weeks 
slipping through shadows 
it said that when mayer first read the book he missed the 
religious time bomb ticking inside its covers 
rushdie was asked twice once before penguin bought the book 
and again afterward what the now notorious mahound chapter was 
supposed to mean the independent wrote 
he seemed curiously reluctant to explain dont worry he 
said at one point its not terribly important to the plot 
in his letter rushdie wrote this passage is a lie as 
penguin editorial staff in london and new york know i discussed 
the background to the satanic verses fully answering all 
questions 
he said he had failed to anticipate the distortions and 
falsifications to which my novel was subsequently subjected but 
he insisted it was ludicrous to suggest he had dismissed some 75 
pages of the novel as unimportant to the plot 
the implication that i deceived viking penguin is wholly 
unjustified and in the present circumstances injurious 
character assassination is also a sort of murder rushdie wrote 
i am acutely conscious of peter mayers present anguish as 
im sure he is of mine he wrote 
rushdie also took issue with the newspapers suggestion that 
since he had nothing to lose he was pressuring penguin to 
produce a paperback version of the satanic verses despite the 
danger that this would further inflame moslem hostility 
id like to think that your readers found the description of 
my present situation more than a little distasteful he wrote 
the letter was dated oct 23 and gave no indication of where it 
was written

spots in the countries history one such blank spot is a 
world war ii massacre of polish officers for which soviet forces 
have generally been blamed 
shevardnadze met for more than an hour with the communist 
partys first secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski and then invited 
adam michnik to join them michnik is editor in chief of the

party with anybody and said the soviet union wants close 
relations with both the communist party and with polands new 
government which is led by solidarity 
speaking of blanks spots in polishsoviet history 
shevardnadze promised they would be cleared up 
we want only the truth it is needed by our two nations and is 
in the interest of friendship he said 
asked how much change the soviet union would tolerate in poland 
he responded we dont set up order in other countries would you 
want it to be so 
shevardnadze arrived in poland on tuesday and as a sign of 
goodwill promised that moscow will maintain fuel deliveries 
crucial to polands survival 
he also met tuesday with taduesz mazowiecki the east blocs 
first noncommunist prime minister and the two announced that 
mazowiecki will visit moscow next month 
the kremlin has said it views the radical political changes in 
poland to be an internal matter its decision to allow poland and 
hungary to chart an independent course marked a significant shift 
in soviet policy toward its east bloc allies 
mazowiecki and his solidarityled cabinet have promised 
however to respect the countrys military obligations to the 
sovietled alliance 
shevardnadze the highestlevel soviet official to visit poland 
since mazowieckis took office in midaugust held a meeting with 
the prime minister tuesday that lasted an hour longer than planned 
i am very happy about our manyfaceted talk mazowiecki said 
after the twohour meeting i accepted the invitation to moscow 
with gratitude he said the visit would be on nov 23 
foreign ministry spokesman stefan staniszewski said after the 
meeting that there are some problems but they were discussed in 
the spirit of understanding and seeking solutions 
he said shevardnadze pledged the soviet union would maintain its 
level of deliveries to poland which is dependent on moscow for 
oil gas electricity and raw materials 
that was a significant gesture because poland has been having 
trouble delivering products to the soviet union due to its 
protracted economic crisis poland suffers from a shortage of 
industrial goods high inflation and a 39 billion foreign debt 
the communist party daily trybuna ludu reported tuesday that 
moscow provides nearly 85 percent of polands crude oil 65 percent 
of its processed petroleum products and 72 percent of its iron ore 
shevardnadze said the soviet union will try to uncover the truth 
about the world war ii massacre of 4300 polish soldiers in the 
katyn forest near smolensk in the soviet union 
moscow has not acknowledged official responsiblity for the 
crime but it generally has been accepted that soviet soldiers were 
to blame 
the issue long has been a sore point in polishsoviet relations 
shevardnadze was asked by reporters if he and mazowiecki had 
discussed the issue all questions everything connected with 
history present and future were raised he replied we are 
going to study history and search for documents if they exist 
poland has been pressing for a joint declaration of soviet 
responsibility for the deaths hardline factions in the soviet 
union so far have been reluctant to do this

east germanys new communist party leader today 
reversed the partys position and said prodemocracy activists will 
be invited to join in national talks on possible reforms 
in another change staterun media reported that the government 
will propose a law next month allowing all citizens to travel to 
the west and dropping requirements that family members stay behind 
as insurance 
and party chief egon krenz hinted tuesday he is considering 
amnesty for people jailed on charges of trying to flee west 
western sources estimate thousands are jailed on such charges 
krenz speaking in response to reporters questions after 
meeting with a senior west german official said prodemocracy 
activists could take part in the reform talks 
no one will be excluded from the dialogue he said 
krenz did not say whether the nations growing opposition would 
be officially recognized or whether challenges to the socialist 
foundation of east germany would be tolerated 
communist party officials previously had made it clear that 
opposition groups would be excluded from such talks and staunchly 
reaffirmed the countrys socialist basis 
in the first meeting between the new leader and a senior west 
german official krenz met for two hours with wolfgang mischnick 
parliamentary leader of the free democratic party the junior 
partner in bonns governing coalition 
on tuesday about 12000 east germans defied a warning from 
krenz and protested in the streets of the capital after parliament 
confirmed him as president police did not intervene 
after the ritual confirmation in the traditionally rubberstamp 
chamber some deputies voted no for the first time in the 
countrys history krenz called for an end to street 
demonstrations by advocates of a more open society 
he also promised to investigate charges of police brutality 
during protests earlier this month and communist authorities 
admitted for the first time that some police had used excessive 
force against peaceful activists 
krenz was in charge of east germanys police at the time 
the 52yearold career politician replaced erich honecker last 
week as party leader east germanys supreme leadership post and 
promised a new course for the country that young skilled 
workers have been leaving by the tens of thousands 
the staterun adn news agency reported tuesday that when the 
communist partys governing central committee begins its next 
session nov 8 it will consider reform proposals including a more 
liberal travel law 
adn said the partys ruling politburo would propose a system 
under which every citizen could get a passport and be allowed to 
travel to all nations and west berlin 
it said the politburo would call for an end to the current 
requirements that family members stay behind as insurance that the 
travelers will return and that current demands for grounds to 
travel should be dropped 
since hungary opened its western border last month more than 
50000 east germans have fled to west germany which grants them 
automatic citizenship tens of thousands more have taken to the 
streets saying they are staying to fight for reforms including 
free elections and speech 
adn said the politburo expressed the hope that the new travel 
law can be put into effect before the end of this year 
krenz ran unopposed for the presidency and received 26 no 
votes in the 500member parliament with another 26 deputies 
abstaining 
his election triggered the east berlin demonstration in which 
marchers demanding more democratic elections chanted egon who 
asked us and we are the competition 
the march was shown on east germanys staterun television and 
reported by adn with no hint of criticism witnesses estimated the 
number of marchers at 7000 but adn reported later that as many as 
12000 took part 
no violence was reported between protesters and police who 
directed traffic to keep the march route clear 
more than 300000 people had marched through the streets of 
leipzig monday night in the largest demonstration in the countrys 
40 years 
an official newspaper the national zeitung charged today that 
governmental neglect has sparked the mass demonstrations in leipzig 
in his acceptance speech tuesday krenz called for an end to 
street protests but also said he would look into the police 
brutality charges 
east german officials later admitted that police had attacked 
peaceful demonstrators adn said that 83 complaints were under 
investigation and that police had apologized in several cases where 
the allegations proved true

air filled the tiny lungs of elizabeth 
patrice cupples for the first time on oct 17 at 503 pm one 
minute later her new world shook violently 
i thought well just have to wait until it stops then they 
can sew me up marilyn cupples recalled one week after the bumpy 
delivery at ami community hospital 
drs katherine corby and marsha muir had just delivered 7pound 
14ounce elizabeth by caesarean section when the operating room 
began shaking 
the baby had just been born when the earthquake started 
things started moving around the lights started to sway the 
walls were moving and things were bumping along said corby 
at that moment the newborn girl was whisked away to the nursery 
while corby and muir fought to stay on their feet to protect the 
mother and shield her from flying debris with their bodies 
mrs cupples said the room started shaking and all i heard 
them say was lets get her the baby out of here 
mrs cupples 40 was awake during delivery but numbed from the 
waist down her husband jim was at her side 
there wasnt much i could do really i knew wed get through 
it said mrs cupples 
corby was astonished by the way mrs cupples handled the 
disaster while we were sewing her up she talked about what the 
richter reading would be she said 
he cupples was in a bit of an altered state though he was 
laughing and telling his new daughter you were born and the earth 
moved they named her elizabeth but during all this they said they 
considered calling her eartha corby said 
there was even more levity in the delivery room 
i said why dont we do a tummy tuck while were at it 
the new mother said 
elizabeth patrice is the first baby for mrs cupples a 
personnel consultant her husband is an engineer 
we have been thinking of all sorts of nicknames because of the 
earthquake mrs cupples said from her santa cruz home tuesday 
eartha quaker tremblor and epi are the ones weve thought 
of epi might stick because her initials are ep and it also 
sounds like epicenter mrs cupples said 
mrs cupples and her newborn went home from the hospital friday 
when i got home i felt like i had been in a time warp the first 
aftershock at home i started crying it jolted me into reality 
she said 
at 504 pm tuesday one week after the delivery and the 
earthquake mrs cupples was nursing elizabeth i wondered if 
there would be an aftershock there is still a feeling around here 
that history may repeat itself

the ruling communist party has for 
the first time indicated it may allow a multiparty democracy 
according to an official party platform released today 
the document adopted at last weeks session of the 
policysetting central committee and carried by tanjug news agency 
declared the party will support the development of political 
pluralism and individual rights and freedoms of individuals 
it also called for free and democratic elections for 
independence of the judiciary and for guaranteeing citizens the 
right to form political associations and independent trade 
unions 
the platform likely to be adopted at the next party congress 
scheduled for jan 20 appears to be the result of a compromise 
between communist reformers and conservatives 
the document stopped short of advocating establishment of 
opposition parties but stressed the party will support the setting 
up of citizens political organizations which ensure the free 
competition of political ideas and programs 
the platform however made clear the party did not accept the 
reduction of political pluralism exclusively to a multiparty 
system as this is only one of the possible forms of political 
pluralism 
yugoslavias liberal northern republic of slovenia already has 
allowed the establishment of several independent political parties 
and plans to hold its first free westernstyle parliamentary 
elections next year 
but the largest republic serbia strongly opposes multiparty 
democracy and is planning to hold its own legislative elections 
next month in which only officially sanctioned candidates will be 
allowed to run 
serbia is supported in its stand by yugoslavias military whose 
entire officer corps is almost entirely made up of communist party 
members

a high school teacher suspended for 
refusing to wear a tie says he may not accept his job back despite 
a judges order that he be reinstated 
i wont go back until i get something in writing that says 
youre welcome to walk into the building said bill webb 
following a ruling tuesday that his constitutional rights were 
violated by a dress code banning denim for teachers and requiring 
male teachers to wear ties 
kanawha county circuit judge tod kaufman ordered webb reinstated 
with back pay and court costs 
webb 46 a math teacher at point pleasant high for 20 years 
was fired dec 21 after being suspended three times for refusing to 
follow the dress code 
a lawyer for the school board says an appeal of kaufmans ruling 
is virtually certain and webb says that would take months so for 
now webb says he will continue working at his gallipolis ohio 
farm and auto repair shop 
knowing the people of mason county the way i do theyll take 
the next eight months to appeal it and we wont know anything 
until june or july he said 
diane johnson an assistant mason county prosecutor acting as 
the school boards attorney says shell ask kaufman for a stay of 
his order until the appeal is settled she said she doesnt plan to 
file for the stay until after the boards nov 6 meeting 
she said however that if webb shows up for work the board 
will file for a stay immediately 
johnson also said the dress code which was revised to delete 
the tie requirement remains in effect 
webb contended that his apparel usually jeans and a cotton work 
shirt caused no problems until superintendent charles chambers 
issued the dress code 
in his ruling kaufman said webb had been praised as an 
excellent teacher who had good rapport with his students and 
said his dress had caused no problems 
this dress code involves constitutional considerations which 
include the right of the individual teacher to dress as he or she 
chooses so long as no disruptive or distracting effects occur which 
are detrimental to the educational process the judge wrote

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the country 
oct 23 
san francisco examiner on the california earthquake 
residents of the san francisco bay area are starting to pick up 
the pieces after the massive earthquake that killed scores of 
people injured and left homeless thousands more and caused 
billions of dollars in damages 
despite the toll some 75000 football fans saw the san 
francisco 49ers play in stanford university stadium on sunday 
defeating the new england patriots and it was announced that the 
world series between the san francisco giants and oakland athletics 
would resume friday 
such events perhaps are part of the answer to a question which 
must be asked why will millions of people continue to live in a 
known fault zone that promises even larger earthquakes with greater 
death and destruction 
one obvious reason is that all of us place our lives and 
fortunes on the line every day more than 50000 persons die each 
year in auto accidents alone 
another part of the answer lies with the unquenchable part of 
the human spirit that has always defied threats to life and 
economic stability 
but together are these reasons the full answer to the question 
of why virtually all of those in the san francisco area are now 
beginning to rebuild their lives and stake out new futures no 
they are not 
a certain state of mind exists in california in general and san 
francisco in particular a youthful exhilaration exists there that 
comes from the outdoor lifestyle of swimming surfing and skiing 
and being on the cutting edge of much change in american society 
for millions the risk of life in that region is worth it

last wednesday oct 18 the switchboard at kywtv in 
philadelphia logged nearly 500 angry calls between 830 am and 
noon 
they came in response to nbcs coverage of the california 
earthquake that expanded the today show and cut the regular 
morning lineup 
the quake put the bay bridge world series on hold the next 
morning sportscasters with a token nod to the tragedy of death and 
devastated lives in california clamored to know when the series 
would resume 
incredible that within hours attention could so easily turn 
from reallife battles for survival to the contrived struggle of a 
game 
disquieting that viewers would respond so angrily at being 
denied an hour of watching actors mimic tragedy 
distressing that even a few americans were unwilling to pause 
and to make the adjustments in their daily lives that comprise 
compassion

baseball commissioner fay vincent deserves special praise for 
his actions since the oct 17 earthquake his decision to delay the 
world series reveals a solid set of priorities 
candlestick park probably could have withstood an early 
resumption of the series bay area residents certainly could use a 
diversion from the task of cleaning up 
but resuming play wasnt worth the extra burden the game would 
place on the areas already overtaxed highway and public safety 
systems having the games on weekday afternoons to meet the east 
coasts primetime schedule would push more traffic onto san 
franciscos weakened transportation system at rush hour 
given how much overemphasis is placed on sports in america 
vincents willingness to postpone the series is heartening 
baseball after all is what youre supposed to do after the real 
work is done

las cruces nm sunnews on flag burning 
its probably a good thing the us senate killed a proposed 
constitutional amendment against burning or otherwise desecrating 
the american flag the bill of rights has stood us in good stead 
for two centuries now and it isnt wise to tinker with it 
the issue was understandably emotioncharged the senators 
understood very well that their constituents love the flag and want 
it protected probably some of them voted for the amendment though 
they privately deemed it unwise and were sure it would be 
defeated in order to appear to be on the side of the angels 
but a number of influential voices including those of several 
leading conservatives had been raised against the amendment the 
gist of what they had to say was that flag burning does not pose 
any such threat to the public order as to justify altering out 
basic guarantees of liberty and due process

pension 
ollie norths corps of heavyweight pals continue to toil on 
behalf of the convicted felon 
their latest effort involves the 23000ayear pension north 
earned for 20 years of military service 
the navy stripped north of the pension after he was convicted 
and sentenced to probation in july for his role in the reagan 
administrations secret scheme to arm the contras 
now some lawmakers are vowing to get the exmarine his pension 
they justify their action by saying congress never intended that 
its antishredding law deprive north of his pension 
the senate is scheduled to vote nov 3 on a bill to exempt north 
from the penalty imposed after his conviction on three felonies 
sen orrin hatch already has the solution give north special 
treatment 
said the utah republican regardless of what happened in the 
irancontra affair people have a difficult time understanding why 
he is being denied the pension that he earned 
sure he earned it by giving 20 years of military service to his 
country but then he decided to shred some documents and in doing 
so gave up any right he has to that money

the bulletin bend ore on students and cultural ignorance 
american college students have a high degree of cultural 
ignorance the cry already has gone up for american colleges to do 
something about that 
a majority of the college seniors responding to a recent gallup 
poll commisssioned by the national endowment for the humanities 
were unable to say who was president at the time of the korean war 
only 58 percent knew that the civil war was fought sometime between 
1850 and 1900 
lynne v cheney chairwoman of the national endowment for the 
humanities used the poll results to call for a mandatory 50hour 
college curriculum which would cover five areas of knowledge 
but a good part of the pressure is being put on the wrong 
institutions students arrive in college having had 12 or more 
years of formal schooling what the test results show is that they 
are being cheated in their elementary and high schools not that 
the colleges have failed

the joplin mo globe on foreign investment 
congress has set its cap to stifle foreign investment which if 
happens would be a gross miscarriage of lawmaking 
the legislative move doubtless has been spurred by a surge of 
foreign investment in the united states in recent years causing 
people to worry about american dependence on other countries 
such concerns are unwarranted for a couple reasons 
one foreign investment is not nearly as extensive as popularly 
thought 
two foreign investment brings to the us economy significant 
advantages 
frankly americans dont or cant because of taxes save enough 
to cover the governments massive deficits so the united states 
needs investments from abroad to continue economic growth and 
sustained vitality

the dallas morning news on the cia 
should the central intelligence agency be given the authority to 
become involved in coups that result in the assassination of 
foreign leaders 
the bush administration seems bent on rescinding a 1976 order 
issued by president gerald ford barring us involvement in 
assassinations bush is entering a mine field 
weakening the ford directive would be a virtual invitation to 
the cia to strike out on adventures that may ultimately be 
counterproductive the temptation to assist in the elimination of 
despised foreign leaders would be great but does the executive 
branch really want to get into the business of playing god 
it may be reasonably asked if cia involvement in foreign 
assassinations might not result in foreign agents showing less 
restraint against us political figures here 
the united states should promote democracy by promoting 
democracy that means giving encouragement to the opponents of 
dictatorships teaching them about the principles of our system of 
government and helping promote the conditions under which democracy 
thrives 
but under no circumstances short of outright war are the 
interests of democracy promoted by dialing cia for murder

the seattle times on east germany 
in a season of extraordinary events in eastern europe the 
removal of erich honecker from power in east germany must rank 
among the most dazzling and perplexing 
the man whose communist principles were steeled by a decade in a 
nazi prison the man who supervised construction of the berlin 
wall is the same leader who had the wit 18 years ago to renew 
political and financial ties with west germany 
honecker 77 was deposed in favor of his younger protege egon 
krenz 52 who is credited with the same dogged commitment to 
hardline ideology 
a startling conclusion that may be slow to form in the west is 
that honecker was removed not for his failure to crush a nascent 
prodemocracy movement but for dragging his feet on economic 
reforms 
honecker who outlasted the nazis could not keep pace with his 
countrys desire for political and economic reform 
if krenz is no more responsive he may not last either

the state columbia sc on east germany and hungary 
egon krenz has made it clear that the communist party in east 
germany will maintain its leading role and will not share power 
with any other political element in truth theres no organization 
to share it with right now 
east germany has not allowed an independent movement like 
polands solidarity to emerge and there is no reform element 
within the party as there is in hungary but the pressures building 
up in the country will create outlets and krenz had better 
have the flexibility to deal with them 
while the leaders were changing in east berlin the party was 
changing in budapest hungarys communist party took the 
unprecedented step of declaring itself politically bankrupt and 
recasting itself as the socialist party then parliament abandoned 
oneparty rule by allowing parties to freely form and compete in 
elections scheduled for next year 
the communist label proved to be poison when poland allowed free 
elections earlier this year just how complete this reformation is 
is not yet apparent the new party elected the former communist 
party chairman as its president but the reformers seem to have the 
upper hand 
as we watch these events we should remember that moscow will 
probably tolerate more deviation in hungary and poland than in east 
germany which it considers the centerpiece of its empire east 
german dissenters might do well to keep that in mind too

vicksburg miss evening post on coca growing 
years before crack became the scourge of america bolivian 
peasants grew coca plants some of the leaves were sent aboard to 
be processed into illegal cocaine but mounds of them wound up in 
the marketplaces of la paz 
the highlands indians were in the habit of chewing the leaves to 
help numb their hunger and the piercing cold 
the presidents of bolivia peru and colombia surely must 
understand that many indians view coca as a medicinal plant that 
helps them survive their harsh environment now with demand for 
cocaine and crack soaring in the united states and europe the 
peasants have come to see it as an export crop that helps ease 
their pain with money 
the peasants who find themselves whipsawed between drug 
outlaws guerrillas and the government need a substitute for their 
coca cultivation 
the presidents of the three drugtroubled andean countries 
decided at their meeting to invite president bush to meet with them 
within 90 days we hope he goes with some concrete ideas for wooing 
the cocagrowing peasants away from the drug traffickers and 
leftwing guerrillas 
the possibilities include targeting us agricultural assistance 
to the remote regions where coca is now grown the peasants need 
help in modernizing their herding and growing practices the united 
states could provide farm equipment and loans for growing legal 
crops 
easing trade barriers into the united states for legal 
agricultural exports from the cocagrowing areas may also help

paris le figaro newspaper that he has not completely rejected it 
sources said lebanese christian legislators who agreed to the 
accord in saudi arabia on sunday feared aoun would have them 
arrested if they returned to beirut aoun said he would guarantee

a mob witness whose protective custody 
is under investigation played court with his family in a 
judges chambers while they lived in an apartment in a police 
station his wife says 
mayor joseph r paolino jr on tuesday announced an internal 
investigation of the police department over the custody of peter 
gilbert a threetime murderer who was a key witness in two trials 
of alleged organized crime figures 
it will be at least the third investigation of the confessed 
murderer who died of a heart attack in june 1988 while on his way 
to an unsupervised skydiving trip in connecticut he had been 
expected to testify against other alleged organized crime figures 
packages containing 9 grams of cocaine were found in gilberts 
parachute bag later investigations showed that while in police 
custody gilbert was paid at least 98000 took other trips 
charged meals and liquor to the state and bought bullets and 
jewelry at taxpayers expense 
paolino who said he didnt know gilbert was in department 
custody ordered the probe because of the outrageous 
revelations of recent weeks including reports that a police 
officer was videotaped joking with gilbert about the free ride they 
were getting 
in the 30 months gilbert 43 was in police custody he was kept 
at a police station apartment with his wife debra and some of his 
seven children then transferred in january 1988 to a safe house 
while he served a 10year sentence for murder 
mrs gilbert told wpritv in an interview broadcast tuesday that 
while the family lived in the apartment at the police station the 
policeman would stand in the hall and peter and i would go skating 
and our daughter had a little threewheeler and would be skating 
all over 
we went into the municipal judges chambers and played 
court and we had fun she said 
the apartment formerly had been a matrons living quarters 
the providence journalbulletin reported saturday that mrs 
gilbert had a videotape of a police officer joking with her 
husband mrs gilbert told the newspaper the tape shows detective 
steven cross with his arm around her husbands shoulders saying 
the criminal justice system has been good to us peter huh 
cross who was recently transferred from the detective division 
to the auto squad which investigates stolen cars was not in the 
office for comment tuesday said police officer bob lauro cross 
told wpritv that his comment was play acting to make gilbert 
feel at home 
wpritv broadcast footage tuesday that it said was taken as 
gilbert cavorted with his police keepers at a florida motel pool 
the station said it obtained the footage from mrs gilbert 
the film showed the incident with cross and pictures the station 
said gilbert took of a new van one of several vehicles he 
apparently bought with a 20000 credit union loan obtained while 
under police protection 
gilbert also videotaped a police officer sleeping in a poolside 
lounge chair while he was supposed to be guarding the witness 
hard time tough duty gilbert said on the tape as he laughed 
the sleeping officer has since committed suicide wpri said 
gov edward d diprete announced a state police investigation of 
the gilbert case last week at the recommendation of the us

romanian leader nicolae ceausescu has 
condemned reforms by some of his soviet bloc neighbors telling a 
communist party plenum in bucharest that they represent an 
abandonment of socialism 
ceausescu who has ruled for 24 years also accused unnamed 
imperialist circles of trying to destroy world communism the 
official agerpres news agency reported today 
the twoday plenum debating ideological questions began one day 
earlier than scheduled observers speculated that the early opening 
may have been prompted by unease over mondays mass commemoration 
in hungary of its 1956 anticommunist uprising 
more than 100000 people gathered for the officially condoned 
rallies in budapest which were broadcast nationally by hungarian 
television and could be watched by many of romanias 
17millionmember hungarian minority 
ceausescu rules over an oldstyle communist state clinging to 
tough economic policies that have produced the soviet blocs worst 
food and energy shortages he criticized hungary and poland by name 
in a speech last week for their marketoriented economic reforms 
poland has the east blocs first noncommunist government and 
hungary this week declared itself a democracy hungarys communist 
party even changed its name 
the romanian party plenum also called to discuss better food 
supplies for its hardpressed people is the last such meeting 
prior to a party congress scheduled for nov 2025 the congress 
formally is the highest decisionmaking body of the communist party 
steps are taken in some soviet bloc countries that weaken 
the positions of socialism and open the way to the reinstatement of 
capitalism in various forms agerpres monitored in vienna 
quoted ceausescu as telling the plenum tuesday 
some openly declare that they want to take various capitalist 
countries for a model ceausescu said it is hard to 
understand though that socialism can be developed and improved by 
taking as a model the capitalist system divided into classes of 
oppressors and oppressed 
although he named no countries ceausescu clearly targeted 
hungary poland and the soviet union as he spoke of economic 
reforms that would open the path to the lowering of the peoples 
living standard 
facts in some socialist countries that switch to the market 
economy such as mounting inflation and profiteering spell 
danger to the very development of the socialist society 
ceausescu said 
in his address ceausescu made clear that romania will stick to 
the centralized economy that has brought it widespread food 
shortages and have left many romanian houses cold and streets dark 
in the past four winters 
he warned that the imperialist circles actions against 
communism are a great danger for detente and cooperation 
if they continue they will inevitably lead to an even more 
drastic deterioration of the world situation ceausescu said 
without elaboration 
romanian exiles abroad listening to his speech broadcast by 
radio bucharest noted that ceausescu stuttered and raised his voice 
several times throughout the twohour frequently emotional speech

the philippines may become another 
colombia if antinarcotics agencies cannot stop the increasingly 
powerful drug rings operating in this country a senator said today 
precisely if we do not do something about this there might 
come a time when we will see the spectacle of the philippines 
becoming like colombia where drug lords even have armies 
helicopters planes and even tanks said sen alberto romulo 
romulo made the statement during a public hearing on last weeks 
report given by sen ernesto herrera alleging that at least 17 
military officials are protecting drug syndicates 
maj gen ramon montano chief of the philippine constabulary 
admitted during the hearing that there are military men involved in 
drug rings but he said officials are doing their best to weed them 
out 
at least 40 officers have been ousted since herreras report and 
assigned to combat units fighting communist guerrillas in the 
countryside montano added 
he said the drug problem has grown swiftly in the last few 
years most drug syndicates operating in asias socalled golden 
triangle of burma laos and thailand use the philippines as a 
relay point to australia the united states italy iran and some 
asian countries he said 
a total of 2543 people were arrested for various drugrelated 
offenses last year and 1884 were arrested from january to 
september this year montano said 
but sen romulo said most of those arrested and convicted were 
smalltime pushers and none of the three major local drug groups 
leaders or their top managers has been arrested 
col virgilio david chief of the constabularys narcotics 
command said he plans to change men under his command as often as 
possible to prevent them from fraternizing with drug ring members 
the temptation is just too great for soldiers whose average 
salary is about 80 pesos 360 a day david said 
during the hearing herrera played the first of at least 15 
tapes of interviews with drug pushers military and police officers 
who gave names of officers involved in corruption involving the 
drug trade

investigators said initial reports indicated the fire started in 
the house of jose gallen the lone fatality they said his 
unidentified wife was hurt when gallen threw the kerosene lamp

another firetruck stalled and blocked a street and had to be 
pushed away by the residents witnesses said 
fire investigator renato recto said they responded immediately

nato defense ministers today welcomed 
soviet promises to cut its powerful military forces but urged the 
kremlin to do more to slash its tactical nuclear weapons 
us defense secretary dick cheney and other ministers of the 
north atlantic treaty organization also applauded in their final 
statement moscows pledge to remove a disputed radar station in 
siberia 
cheney cautioned that the soviet union remains a powerful 
military force and said there is great uncertainty about how 
events will unfold in the soviet union 
wrapping up two days of nuclear strategy talks on the southern 
portuguese coast the officials said they looked forward to the 
prompt and full implementation of this commitment 
after the meeting cheney was to fly to london for talks with 
british officials on the european leg of a threeweek foreign tour 
in the final statement the ministers said they were 
encouraged by the changes underway in the soviet union and some of 
its allies 
nevertheless we recognized the continuing capability of the 
forces of the warsaw pact for offensive military action it said 
it expressed concern about substantial capabilities in 
moscows space program and its nuclear modernization program 
we welcomed the announced warsaw pact unilateral force 
reductions and looked forward to their full implementation the 
statement said 
however the ministers said the cuts would have little effect 
on the warsaw pacts nuclear capability and in particular on 
their continuing massive superiority in shortrange nuclear missile 
systems 
we therefore called again on the soviet union to reduce 
unilaterally its shortrange missile systems to current nato 
levels the statement said 
the ministers agenda was somewhat overshadowed by soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadzes unusually candid speech on 
monday 
he told the soviet legislature that the krasnoyarsk radar 
station violated the 1972 ussoviet antiballistic missile treaty 
and said it would be removed the facility stood in the way of 
further arms treaties he said 
it was an acknowledgement of what the united states has 
maintained for a long time said a senior us official speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
we obviously applaud this recognition and the pledge to 
dismantle the installation he said 
west german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg called 
shevardnadzes speech remarkable and a true sign of glasnost 
openness 
the fact that he stands up and says straight out that 
krasnoyarsk was a violation of the abm treaty is a whole new 
language he told reporters 
shevardnadze said the decision to take down the giant 
phasedarray radar had been criticized internally but he said 
we are saving the abm treaty and opening the way to the 
conclusion of a treaty on strategic weapons 
the united states has argued the abm treaty prohibited the 
deployment of large radar stations capable of giving early 
warnings of missile attacks anywhere except on the periphery of 
us or soviet territory the krasnoyarsk radar is deep within 
soviet siberia 
in his speech shevardnadze also called for dissolving nato and 
the sovietled warsaw pact 
not surprisingly the nato officials did not share his vision of 
an end to the western allliance 
i can assure you were not thinking of disbanding nato 
stoltenberg said 
all 16 nato nations except france attended the meeting france 
does not belong to the alliances integrated military structure 
iceland which has no armed forces has observer status

the soviet union is trimming tank production 
by half for the next five years building only 850 tanks annually 
according to a report published today 
soviet defense minister dmitri yazov made the promise during 
meetings earlier this month with defense secretary dick cheney 
according to unidentified defense officials cited by the washington 
post 
in vilamoura portugal today cheney said soviet officials have 
indicated it is their intention to produce fewer tanks than they 
have in the past 
we have seen some beginning signs that in fact that transition 
may be occurring he said at a news conference on the final day 
of a nato nuclear strategy session 
even so he said as of today their tank production still far 
exceeds that of the west all nato nations combined although it 
does appear to be lower than it has been in the recent past 
pressed about a promised reduction to 850 tanks a year cheney 
replied i wouldnt want to be more precise than i have been 
the defense intelligence agency has estimated annual soviet tank 
production at 3500 in a total warsaw pact output of 4200 but 
soviet marshal sergei f akhromeyev told the house armed services 
committee in july the figure was about 1700 
the newspaper said dia recently reported a reduction in soviet 
tank production 
if yazovs pledge of an additional 50 percent reduction is 
realized soviet tank production would be about 850 per year us 
production is about 775 in a total north atlantic treaty 
organization output of 925 a year the newspaper said 
an unidentified senior defense official told the post that the 
production cut may be a result of the soviets reconsidering what 
kinds of weapons are effective 
while tank production is decreasing production of artillery 
and armored personnel carriers is increasing the official said

the fatal explosions that ripped through 
a plastics plant also may send shock waves through the industry 
driving up plastics prices worldwide analysts said 
analysts said if the phillips petroleum co plant is destroyed 
or shut down for a while manufacturers of plastic products like 
milk jugs and grocery bags could be scrambling for plastic at 
higher prices 
if the whole thing goes down there are going to be shortages 
all over the place said analyst bill kuhlke of dewitt amp co a 
houstonbased chemical consulting company 
the blasts at the plant killed as many as 23 workers and injured 
124 two bodies have been recovered and up to 21 others are missing 
and presumed dead 
phillips which supplies up to 19 percent of a common plastic 
base has been leading several companies building factories along 
texas gulf coast company officials said phillips supplies about a 
third of the worlds plastics and its polyethylene plant no 5 
represented a large chunk of their production power 
phillips spokesman dave dryden of the companys bartlesville 
okla headquarters said the effects of losing the plant were 
unclear 
were very early in the assessment dryden said 
phillips bought the 800acre pasadena plant in 1948 and turned 
it into a huge complex employing more than 900 people it produces 
more than 2 billion pounds of plastics per year threequarters of 
it polyethylene 
the damage we know of was primarily to the polyethylene 
plant dryden said the plant was scheduled to increase 
production 15 percent in 1990 
he said phillips has another plant at the complex that makes 500 
million pounds of polypropylene annually which is used carpet 
fibers and films and another part produces kresin for plastic 
water bottles and rigid but flexible plastic cups like the ones 
used on airlines that production was to increase production by 50 
percent in 1990 
consultant earl simpson with bonner amp moore associates said he 
had brushed off talk of a polyethylene price increase the industry 
hoped to see nov 1 but the phillips explosion may allow a rise of 
about 3 cents per pound product in storage will only last about 
five weeks he said

foreign minister siddhi savetsila 
confirmed today that khmer rouge guerrillas have seized a key 
cambodian town near the thai border and captured tanks and 
artillery 
but siddhi the first top official to confirm that the western 
town of pailin was in guerrilla hands said neither the cambodian 
government nor guerrilla forces are strong enough to win a clear 
victory 
in the end they will have to compromise and come back to 
negotiations he told a weekly news briefing 
the guerrillas said the victory sunday opened the door for an 
assault 40 miles to the northeast on battambang cambodias 
secondlargest city after the nations capital pnom penh 
khmer rouge army radio on tuesday called on officials and 
soldiers of cambodias vietnameseinstalled government to quit 
parents and compatriots please call on your children and 
husbands to quickly desert for home in order to stay alive 
said the broadcast a text of which was seen in bangkok today 
army officers had vowed to hold onto pailins gemrich area 
seized by the khmer rouge who have been fighting to topple the 
government for the past 11 years 
thailand is leading efforts to restart the peace process 
stalled since the failure of an international conference in paris 
in august 
the main stumbling block was the cambodian governments refusal 
to agree to a government role for the khmer rouge which massacred 
hundreds of thousands of cambodians during four years of rule 
before vietnam invaded in 1978 and ousted it from power the khmer 
rouge tried to turn cambodia into an agrarian commune 
asked if the khmer rouge controlled pailin the minister said 
yes it is true he added that according to thai military 
reports the guerrillas captured nine artillery pieces four tanks 
six trucks and large quantities of ammunition in their assault on 
the town 
thai military sources said cambodian government forces had 
pulled back to route 10 linking pailin with battambang the 
provincial capital but the khmer rouge continued its attacks and 
was trying to seize more territory 
the khmer rouge killed 120 government soldiers and captured 17 
in their final assualt on pailin the sources said 
the communist khmer rouge is the strongest member of the 
guerrilla coalition that also includes the noncommunist khmer 
peoples national liberation front and the army of prince norodom 
sihanouk 
the two noncommunist groups also have scored significant 
victories in western cambodia north of pailin since late september 
when vietnam said it pulled out the last of its troops 
siddhi said today it was uncertain the two factions could hold 
on to their gains 
on tuesday heavy fighting was reported along route 69 as the 
guerrillas of the liberation front advanced towards svey chek 
which they described as the only barrier between them and the 
strategic town of sisophon 
dien del deputy commander of the front claimed tuesday his 
group seized eight small government outposts and cut route 69 south 
and north of svey chek

at least 20 policemen and soldiers 
were arrested on charges of rape attempted extortion and other 
crimes during the struggle with sinhalese extremists officials 
said today 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne said several military officers 
were among those arrested in the past month lt gen hamilton 
wanasinghe the army commander said if the arrested are found 
guilty they will be dealt with most severely 
wijeratne said among those arrested were five policemen in a 
colombo suburb on charges of raping a young sinhalese woman they 
detained for questioning after claiming she belonged to the 
peoples liberation front a radical sinhalese group 
police arrested four army lieutenants who allegedly posed as 
front members and tried to extort money from a wealthy businessman 
in the town of wellawatte just south of colombo said wijeratne 
who is also deputy defense minister 
the officials commented after the sun an independent newspaper 
voiced concern about an increase in the number of serious crimes 
blamed on police 
at least 5000 people have been killed in the sinhalese 
heartland of central and southern sri lanka since july 1987 when 
the government signed an indianbrokered accord designed to end an 
insurgency by tamil militants in northeastern sri lanka 
the government has blamed most of the deaths on the front which 
has assassinated fellow sinhalese who serve or back the government 
however human rights activists opposition politicians and 
religious leaders say government forces and progovernment 
vigilante groups are responsible for many killings 
the peoples liberation front accuses the government of selling 
out the rights of the mainly buddhist sinhalese majority by making 
too many concessions to the tamil minority tamils who are mostly 
hindus account for 18 percent and say they are discriminated 
against 
tamil guerrillas launched a series of massacres of sinhalese 
civilians those attacks plus the ensuing war pitting the 
guerrillas against sri lankan soldiers and later indian 
peacekeepers have claimed 11000 lives since the tamil separatist 
insurrection began in 1983

witnesses called by attorneys for a white police 
officer charged with manslaughter in the shooting of a black 
motorcyclist testified today about past racial disturbances in the 
city 
however circuit judge joseph farina restricted evidence about 
plans for quelling any violence that might stem from the officers 
trial 
the judge and attorneys for both sides agreed tuesday that riots 
were likely if officer william lozano were acquitted 
lozanos attorney roy black who wants the trial moved from 
dade county did succeed today in admitting a metrodade police 
contingency plan into evidence although farina ordered it sealed 
for now 
also introduced was a poster from the overtown comrades that 
the defense described as an inflammatory and offered as proof of 
efforts to whip up anger over the trial in the black community 
lozano is charged with two counts of manslaughter in the deaths 
of motorcyclist clement lloyd 23 and passenger allan blanchard 
24 
their deaths touched off three days of racial disturbances in 
january 
farina who will rule on blacks motion for change of venue 
after hearing more testimony and arguments today said tuesday he 
didnt need to hear lengthy testimony about the possibility of 
violence 
there very well may be posttrial difficulties said farina 
but we dont need individuals testifying to that 
one person was killed 11 others were wounded by gunfire and 13 
buildings were burned in the rioting after lloyd was shot while 
being chased by police blanchard was fatally injured when the 
motorcycle crashed 
the defense attorney had subpoenaed scores of witnesses and 
wanted to enter newspaper clippings videotapes and other documents 
into evidence to show that public agencies were preparing for more 
violence 
jurors are going to think if they find my client guilty there 
is not going to be a riot but if they find not guilty there is 
going to be a riot black said its unfair for ordinary people 
to have that much responsibility on their shoulders 
but farina threw out most of the subpoenas and limited the riot 
testimony during the change of venue hearing to police reports from 
four previous racial disturbances in the 1980s all of which 
resulted after a jury found a policeman was innocent of shooting a 
black man 
the judge and attorneys decided monday to seat a large jury pool 
just before the change of venue motions so the panel could be 
ordered to avoid reading or listening to testimony on the motions 
prosecutors sought to quash blacks subpoenas but did not 
dispute the threat of violence in case of acquittal 
there is a degree of probability that a riot will occur 
said roy wood an assistant dade county attorney 
police have acknowledged contingency plans for a posttrial 
riot including the purchase of 700 gas masks arrangements for use 
of two armored vehicles and the possible use of the orange bowl to 
house those arrested during any disturbances 
farina said careful questioning of potential jurors should 
determine whether their deliberations will be affected by the 
chance of possible riots 
i have no doubts that there are a number of individuals in 
this community who will accept that responsibilty as difficult as 
it may be he said

the death of a hospital patient is being 
investigated as a possible mercy killing and two doctors have been 
barred from practicing at the hospital until the review is 
completed officials said today 
dr viswa nathan a heart surgeon was suspended oct 4 after 
the death the same day of clarence a reid 66 of new haven said 
officials at the hospital of st raphael a second doctor a 
resident at the hospital was placed on a leave of absence the 
hospital said the second doctor was not identified 
hospital spokesman ken warren said today an investigation was 
begun because of the circumstances surrounding the death but 
he would not elaborate he said reids family was notified of the 
investigation on the day of his death 
nathan did not want to comment on the allegations a secretary 
at his new haven office said today she said he was referring all 
calls to st raphaels 
reids wife innebell was quoted by the new haven register on 
wednesday as saying she never asked nathan to put her husband out 
of his suffering 
she said she took her husband to the hospital after he suffered 
what she thought was a stroke doctors found a blood clot and 
decided to operate but reid never regained consciousness after the 
surgery she said 
i never would have asked the doctor to let my husband die my 
husband was a beautiful man she told the register 
reids death certificate says his thoracic aorta a major blood 
vessel burst 
warren would not comment on whether the hospital believed the 
doctors may have acted on their own or heeded a request from the 
family 
euthanasia is illegal in all 50 states though the practice is 
considered common in most cases a doctor either withholds or 
withdraws a supportive treatment that might prolong life in a 
terminal illness 
an investigation by st raphaels medical board into the 
possibility of a mercy killing could take from a week to two 
months said hospital president daniel rissing 
the hospital said it notified both the state medical examiners 
office and the state department of health services medical quality 
assurance division 
no doctor has ever been convicted of a mercy killing in 
connecticut

folks in boston and chicago may have 
been out of luck if they tried to buy fresh california strawberries 
last wednesday and thursday 
electrical failures after last tuesdays earthquake meant 
125000 crates of berries many bound for east and midwest markets 
from this farming community were left unrefrigerated overnight 
by the time they reached their destinations they were spoiled 
a week after the quake forced more than 1000 residents into 
tents and shelters employers still are assessing their losses 
i would not be one to say losses will be minimal under the 
circumstances they might be considered minimal but to the 
individual they are pretty severe said santa cruz county 
agricultural commissioner leonard kraft 
an estimated 5 million to 6 milion worth of crops were bruised 
or damaged when the quake toppled storage bins according to ron 
tyler of the agricultural extension service 
and losses at the plants that process 40 percent of the 
countrys frozen foods wont be known until workers determine how 
much of the produce shaken from 30foothigh shelves can be 
repacked and how much must be thrown out 
most companies say those losses should be small indicating that 
while production lines and shipments of frozen broccoli 
cauliflower and brussels sprouts have been slowed the industry 
isnt devastated 
i dont think theres a doubt the industry will rebound 
kraft said its the heart and soul of the area 
more than 7 million worth of packaged vegetables spilled onto 
the warehouse floor at the richard a shaw inc frozen food 
company but president jeffrey shaw said he expects most of the 
vegetables can be repacked 
were hoping 500000 in losses is a worst case shaw 
said were hoping we can get it down to a 5 percent loss of 
whats on the floor our focus is going to be on shipping 
merchandise ship now and clean up later weve got to ship to 
create space to speed up the cleanup 
strawberry packers are expecting very little loss the season 
ends nov 1 so were fortunate it happened at this time theres 
not really much to recover from since were near the end anyway 
said herb baum president of naturipe berry growers 
but stalled production will be felt strongly by the 7000 
residents who harvest crops from local fields or work in the food 
processing plants here 
the personal losses they have suffered have been compounded by 
the lack of a place to work green giant expects to be closed for 
at least two weeks leaving 600 people out of work and shaw inc 
is operating with about 200 of its 900 employees 
not only have they lost their jobs but there are no 
alternatives left in town jeffrey shaw said 
even the agriculture industry which makes up 65 percent of the 
communitys economy may not be strong enough to rebuild the town 
by itself 
we have quite a large population in the city who work in 
agriculture and all the downtown store owners depend on people to 
spend their paychecks at the store kraft said 
a lot of peoples homes are destroyed he added those 
people may work in agriculture but thats not going to help

the city council is asking the state and 
county to reopen the murder case of civil rights leader medgar 
evers more than a quartercentury afer he was gunned down 
a council member said the move indicates how much attitudes have 
changed 
hopefully the district attorney will follow through to 
correct an injustice of the past councilman louis armstrong said 
tuesday after the vote 
the motive for introducing this resolution was to begin 
healing a festering wound created by a subversion of justice by the 
state sovereignty commission armstrong said of the nowdefunct 
segregation watchdog agency 
i think it was incumbent upon the city council to protect the 
rights of one of its citizens who was murdered by bigotry and 
hatred 
the city councils vote came a day after the clarionledger a 
jackson newspaper reported that in 1964 investigators from the 
sovereignty commission helped the defense screen prospective jurors 
at the first of two trials of byron de la beckwith who was charged 
in evers death 
armstrongs resolution asked the state attorney general and 
hinds county district attorney to reopen the investigation and 
prosecution in connection with the civil rights leaders june 12 
1963 slaying 
a secretary in the office of district attorney ed peters said he 
would be out of town all week and and no one else could comment on 
whether he would reopen the case jim warren a special assistant 
to attorney general mike moore said the decision would be up to 
peters we would however offer him any assistance if he so 
requests warren said 
the council which has a majority of white members voted 42 
with one council member absent 
beckwith was tried twice in 1964 by allwhite juries for the 
murder of evers a naacp field secretary who was gunned down in the 
driveway of his jackson home both trials ended in hung juries 
prosecutors said beckwiths fingerprint was on a gun found in 
bushes near the slaying and witnesses placed his car near the 
scene 
beckwith said his gun was stolen 
councilman e c foster said tuesday that he voted for the 
resolution because hed like to see the case solved 
primariy its clear that the murderer is still free and so 
if by reopening the investigation we can bring the murderer to 
justice then i think thats what should happen he said 
councilman derwood boyles who voted against the resolution 
said monday as far as im concerned that comes under the 
heading of the district attorney and the attorney general and i 
dont personally think i should be telling them what to do 
i think if mr evers was here hed tell us we have more 
important things to do than that said boyles

president mikhail s gorbachev today 
began a visit to a thriving soviet neighbor seeking finnish help 
in bolstering his countrys ailing economy 
accompanied by his wife raisa gorbachev was given a redcarpet 
airport welcome by president mauno koivisto and driven under 
overcast skies to the waterfront presidential residence in downtown 
helsinki 
finland has long sought to maintain its independence and 
neutrality but for centuries it has generally been subservient to 
its giant neighbor the nations fought bitter wars twice during 
world war ii and finland each time was forced to grant territorial 
concessions to the soviet aggressors 
though long considered to be under moscows thumb increasingly 
liberal east european countries and soviet republics are using 
finland as a model of how to cooperate with moscow maintain 
independence and run an effective economy 
a handful of demonstrators were among several hundred finns who 
lined the street near the palace to greet the soviet leader many 
cheering and waving small finnish and soviet flags 
the demonstrators wanted their government to seek the return of 
karelia an eastern region which finland ceded to the soviets in 
1944 
give us back our karelia the protesters shouted in finnish 
as gorbachev reviewed the honor guard in a light rain 
i want the soviets to discuss with us whether they would 
return it since they said stalin took it and that it was an 
unwarranted aggression what would be wrong with correcting 
that mistake said martti siirala 66 who said he was born in 
the annexed territory 
finnish officials have said they did not expect the issue to be 
raised during gorbachevs threeday visit and they said most finns 
accept soviet control of the region about 400000 finns were 
displaced by the annexation 
gorbachev whose economic reforms need an infusion of western 
technology and business acumen planned to sign a fiveyear trade 
agreement and several specific accords for new joint businesses 
one agreement is to set the groundwork for new industries in the 
kola peninsula which until recently was a closed military area it 
is the home of the soviet northern fleet and the base for northern 
defenses 
in the gorbachev entourage was vaino vyalyas the communist 
party chief of estonia his inclusion reflected recognition of the 
cultural links between the finns and the people of the baltic 
republic across the gulf of finland 
soviet government spokesman gennady gerasimov also in the 
entourage reiterated in an interview that moscow has no plans to 
hinder east bloc countries instituting democratic reform 
the brezhnev doctrine as you called it is dead and there is no 
hope of revival he told abcs good morning america 
referring to the concept of intervention named after the late 
soviet leader 
these countries poland hungary and others are members of 
the warsaw pact which we want to disband together simultaneously 
with the nato pact and they are still members of the mutual 
council on economic assistance he said 
despite a bloody history the soviets and finns have close 
business ties based for many years on the barter of soviet oil for 
finnish goods 
finland still is the soviets secondlargest trading partner in 
the capitalist world after west germany but its own trade 
dependency on the soviet union declined as oil prices plunged 
the finns increasingly have turned toward western europe and 
shifted their economy from basic industries and shipbuilding to 
electronics and high technology 
finlands trade with the soviets fell from 25 percent of its 
total exports in 1983 to just 13 percent this year at the same 
time its own economy became one of the fastest growing in the west 
expanding about 5 percent a year 
the two countries share a 793mile border 
in 1948 finland and the soviet union signed a treaty of 
friendship and cooperation which guaranteed the soviets 
northwestern front finland adopted a cautious neutral foreign 
policy which now is being held up as a model by reformers in the 
baltic states and others in the soviet sphere 
as of next year residents of estonia and the other baltic 
republics will take over management of their local economies from 
moscow opening the way for further finnish and western involvement 
finland already has daily ferry service to tallinn the estonian 
capital and residents of the two regions which are linguistic and 
cultural cousins can watch each others television

judges and lawyers must do more to keep 
noncriminal cases in federal courts from taking too long and 
costing too much congress was told wednesday 
the excessive cost and delay associated with litigating civil 
cases in america should no longer be tolerated and can be 
forcefully addressed through procedural reform more active case 
management by judges and better efforts by attorneys and their 
clients said a 39page report prepared by a special task force 
the report is the result of a ninemonth study by 36 lawyers and 
law professors whose effort was suggested by sen joseph biden 
ddel chairman of the senate judiciary committee 
biden called the reports recommendations an important and 
encouraging start and said his committee will give a high 
priority to civil justice reform 
the report focuses on federal courts only but the task force 
said its recommendations could be applied to state and local courts 
as well 
the task force urged congress to provide a mix of suggestions 
and incentives to spark change and then let those who use the 
system fill in the details 
our core recommendations allow each federal court to 
develop its own set of reforms for reducing delay and litigation 
costs within some broad parameters that congress would establish 
through federal legislation the report says 
the task force recommended 
that congress require all federal trial judges to streamline 
the pretrial exchange of information between both sides of a 
lawsuit that process called discovery accounts for an 
estimated 60 percent of all federal litigation costs 
each trial courts streamlining plan should include a system of 
assigning differing tracks to cases of different complexity 
fixed timetables and deadlines for completion of discovery and the 
start of a trial would depend on what track a case is assigned 
judges should adopt a firm and consistent policy for 
minimizing continuances or exceptions to the fixed deadlines 
imposed 
clients either in person or by telephone should participate 
in any courtsponsored settlement conferences that would make it 
impossible for the attorneys to delay settlement discussions 
often for weeks or months with the timehonored excuse let me 
get back to you after ive discussed this with my client the 
task force report said 
judges should not rely on magistrates as heavily as some now do 
in keeping track of civil cases that have not yet gone to trial 
the report also recommended increasing judges administrative 
staffs and raising judges salaries 
and the report called for cooperation from the countrys lawyers 
the nation needs and must get a substantial commitment 
from the bar to address this challenge as well it said there 
is a consensus that some litigation costs are incurred as a direct 
outgrowth of the incentives that have been built into the private 
legal industry itself 
the task force noted that the legal profession increasingly is 
dominated by escalating lawyer salaries and heavier demands for 
billable hours 
the time has come for the profession to examine the impact of 
costs on the delivery of legal services and the critical question 
whether increasing costs have impeded access to the courts the 
task force report said

night hes out there the likelihood is less but it is very very 
possible

weather and knew what to do his mother sarah madsen said tuesday 
thank god he has been trained on what to do out there in 
the woods i have to trust in nathan because i know he knows what 
to do she said 
he may have panicked when he first realized he was lost but 
after that im sure his common sense took over im sure he is ok 
he may be cold and he may be wet but im sure hes ok

together for a long time hoy said of the 10yearold sorrel

buddy was no ordinary tomcat at 6 years 
old hed survived two broken jaws innumerable fights a fall from 
a fourthstory window and various internal injuries 
but buddy like many family pets was powerless to fight the 
enemy he faced at 504 pm on oct 17 
the 71magnitude bay area earthquake that took dozens of lives 
injured thousands and caused more than 7 billion damage also 
claimed a large number of pets 
just like human victims pets were trapped in falling buildings 
consumed by fires and crushed in cars but perhaps the largest 
numbers were swallowed by panic in a world gone temporarily haywire 
buddy and another cat a spayed female named poochie lived in 
an apartment building partially demolished by fire the night of the 
quake it has since been razed said buddys veterinarian lee 
morris 
they esccaped from the burning apartment both cats ran 
outdoors buddy died he was burned they found his body its 
pretty ironic that he didnt make it through this because if 
anybody could have it would have been him morris said 
poochie did survive when her owner went back in for 15 
minutes before they wrecked the building she had come back she 
poochies owner brought her in on thursday she smelled like 
smoke but she was ok morris said 
what was nightmarish about the quake was not only did we 
scare the bejesus out of the cats and dogs but we lost power 
said rich avanzino president of the san francisco society for the 
prevention of cruelty to animals 
disoriented animals rushing hither and yon were crossing 
streets with abandon coming upon motorists who no longer had the 
benefit of street lights avanzino said 
several veterinarians told the story of spot a black 
3yearold female cat who like dockworker buck helm defied odds 
to survive 
spot was sunning herself on an apartment building windowsill 
avanzino said she was dislodged and fell 10 floors to the 
concrete she was rushed here and came out with only a broken leg 
thats one lucky cat he said 
dr john holden at mission pet hospital treated about 20 
fourlegged quake victims there were some traumatic injuries 
one cat was crushed under boxes there were a lot of glass 
injuries he said 
the cat crushed by boxes came in pretty gorked out but hes 
doing better neurologically he added 
he is sure many pets have yet to be found no one will ever know 
how many dogs cats guinea pigs fish birds reptiles and other 
pets were killed in the quake he said 
at least two dozen animals who bolted from their homes during 
the quake have been reunited with their owners by san francisco 
animal care and control said director carl friedman a dozen more 
are being cared for by the agency 
avanzino and other spca employees spent the night of the temblor 
in quake zones handing out pet food leashes cat carriers 
dishes bowls and water he said 
since then the spca has been working to arrange for temporary 
homes for animals whose owners were left homeless avanzino said 
dan harberts owner of bubbling well pet memorial park in napa 
said he had arranged for the burials of at least two dogs who died 
of earthquakerelated injuries 
the veterinarians said there were few ways to protect pets from 
earthquake injury or death its important to have carriers or ways 
to confine animals in an emergency holden said and returning to 
normal as quickly as possible will help an animal after a quake 
morris whose patients in addition to poochie included a dog who 
went through a window and cut up his nose and several cats who 
pulled their toenails out in struggles to get away said the best 
thing owners can do is offer to your pets the same comfort now 
that they have always offered you 
and he added dont be upset if a pet hides cowers refuses 
food pouts mopes vomits or wets where he or she shouldnt for a 
while 
ive talked to about 30 people who describe psychological 
problems with their pets in some cases the people are stressed 
and are reading their own problems into their pets morris said

officials have ousted operators of a 
program providing meals to the elderly that former president reagan 
once praised as a national model but later was accused of 
mismanagement and poor service 
the county council on aging ordered locks changed tuesday at a 
recreation center where it canceled the contract under which 
frances freeman operated the south park area councils meal program 
for six years 
on thursday the tucson urban league will take over the remainder 
of a 70000 contract to feed 75 to 80 people a hot lunch each day 
said marian lupu executive director of the council on aging 
ms freemans group had the contract with the state and 
federally subsidized council on aging since 1983 she ran a 
foodfortheelderly program with local funds for 13 years before 
that 
ms lupu said monitoring by the council on aging and an audit by 
the state department of economic security showed a great number 
of irregularities in the way the program has been delivered to the 
participants 
the council on aging accused ms freemans group of cutting meal 
portions and mishandling signin sheets that are supposed to verify 
that recipients get served said diana edwards a council program 
monitor 
in 1982 thenpresident reagan pointed to ms freemans meals 
program as an outstanding model of social service volunteerism at a 
time of federal cuts in social programs 
ms edwards said her agency worked with ms freemans group 
since 1983 trying to bring it into contract compliance she said 
that last year it lost the contract for home delivery of meals in 
may for transportation of about 25 people to the center and on 
tuesday for providing meals at the center 
george logan assistant director for management review at the 
department of economic security in phoenix said the attorney 
generals office would determine whether criminal charges should be 
filed he said there is that potential very definitely 
margo cowan a community activist who identified herself as 
secretary of the south park area council told the associated press 
that she ms freeman and other officials of the group would have 
no comment 
but the tucson citizen quoted ms freeman as saying she never 
was told directly that council on aging funding was being cut off 
and first heard about it tuesday morning as she was on her way to 
the center 
ms freeman said she plans to keep helping elderly people 
without the funding

members who killed two white teenagers in 1974 in an effort to set 
off racial violence has been paroled from prison after serving 14 
years of a 199year term

illinois the commission agreed to free him

husband was in critical condition 
charles and carol stuart were abducted while leaving brigham and 
womens hospital where theyd attended a birthing class monday 
night 
their abductor forced them to drive to the citys mission hill 
district then robbed and shot them 
stuart then used the cars cellular phone to call police but 
could not give his location when he lost consciousness operators 
listened on the phone for the sirens of passing police cars 
mrs stuarts baby was delivered at the hospital shed left 
hours earlier a hospital spokeswoman would say only that the baby 
was alive but would not comment further 
the couple had chosen christopher as the babys name because 
doctors had said he would be born the day after christmas said 
rosemary leone aunt of the 33yearold mrs stuart 
if you could only see how beautifully formed he is she 
said he looked perfect they told us to stroke his face because 
they said he would need a lot of love 
she wanted this baby so badly but they dont think theres 
much hope for him she said 
she had what she always wanted a good job a husband a 
house and soon a baby and then one bastard came and took it all 
away said mrs stuarts cousin cheryl leone 
stuart 29 general manager of a fur store in bostons back bay 
remained in critical condition today with a gunshot wound to the 
abdomen a boston city hospital spokesman said 
at a news conference today joseph saia deputy police 
superintendent said stuarts condition had kept him from assisting 
in the investigation 
hopefully he will recover and provide invaluable help to the 
case he said 
police have no suspects but mayor raymond flynn said 
fingerprints were found in the stuarts car along with two 
38caliber slugs 
we now need people to come forward and provide whatever 
information they have whether they saw something or heard 
something flynn said police officers will be combing the 
mission hill public housing development and talking to everyone 
and anyone 
the gunman apparently thought the stuarts were police officers 
after seeing the car phone said joseph dunford deputy police 
superintendent before shooting the couple according to dunford 
the gunman said i think youre fiveo slang for police 
stuart battled for himself and his wife in the minutes after 
they were shot and left for dead police said but as he spoke to 
police on his telephone he faded in and out of consciousness while 
his pregnant wife lay dying next to him 
he cried in pain and confusion not knowing where he was he 
couldnt tell state police dispatcher gary mclaughlin where to send 
help 
oh man it hurts and my wife has stopped gurgling shes 
stopped breathing stuart called out according to a transcript 
released tuesday by police 
then there was silence 
chuck can you hear me chuck chuck can you hear me buddy 
mclaughlin pleaded pick up the phone chuck chuck come on 
chuck can you hear me chuck chuck pick up the phone i can hear 
you breathing there chuck come on buddy 
still nothing 
mclaughlin instructed stuart at one point to open his door or 
window to see if he could identify some landmark so that help 
could find him 
but stuart only replied im blanking out 
you cant blank out on me i need you man chuck chuck 
in a desperate effort to home in on the car police in cruisers 
were told to flick their sirens off and on one by one mclaughlin 
was able to tell which cruiser was near the stuarts car by 
listening to the sirens coming over the phone 
get my wife out stuart told the officers who found him 
the ambulance crew that cae to the aid of the stuarts had been 
riding with a camera crew from the cbstv series rescue 911 
which tells reallife stories about rescue operations 
the crew videotaped stuart regaining consciousness and talking 
about the attack as paramedics worked on him en route to boston 
city hospital and was allowed into the emergency room cbs 
spokesman mike silver said in new york 
the mayor asked that every available detective be put on the 
case said police spokeswoman jill reilly 
at a news conference flynn was asked why the killing was 
getting so much attention when shootings occur almost daily in 
other distressed areas of the city 
no matter whether it happens in roxbury charlestown back bay 
or beacon hill whatever area or color or ethnicity it will be 
handled in the same aggressive and fair way by the boston police 
department he replied 
ted kakas an owner of the fur store where stuart has worked for 
eight years said couple had just celebrated their fourth wedding 
anniversary the child was the couples first 
the couple from suburban reading were mindful of the rise of 
violence in the city friends said 
chuck and i had talked about the number of shootings that had 
gone on there said fellow employee peter jaworski it seemed 
almost daily the number of people getting shot 
so many senseless things going on jaworski said choking on 
his words

jim bakker head bowed and bound hand and 
foot was led into federal prison to begin a 45year sentence for 
defrauding thousands of followers of his television ministry 
my reports are hes going through the process very normally 
warden don southerland said after bakker arrived at the talladega 
federal correctional institution late tuesday 
after surrendering his valuables showering leaving his 
fingerprints and donning prison garb bakker entered the cell he 
will share with another lightweight security inmate 
southerland said 
after his arrival the founder of ptl kept his eyes on the 
ground as six guards hustled him from a brown sedan to the entrance 
of the rural mediumsecurity prison in east alabama 
officials said he would stay here for about two weeks before 
transfer to another prison 
obviously he is not a normal inmate but he is being 
processed as a normal inmate southerland said 
two former bakker aides sentenced a month ago to more than 17 
years each after being convicted of income tax evasion reported to 
an alabama prison today david taggert and his brother james 
arrived at the minimumsecurity prison at maxwell air force base in 
montgomery 
bakker had no comment for the dozens of reporters gathered at 
the redbrick prison surrounded by two 15foot fences topped with 
razor wire 
us district judge robert potter of charlotte nc who 
sentenced bakker on tuesday also fined him 500000 saying that 
bakker was unrepentant and still trying to milk supporters for 
money he ordered him to begin serving the long sentence 
immediately 
bakker would have to serve at least 10 years in prison before 
achieving parole unless a planned appeal is successful 
southerland said bakker was allowed to contact his family before 
being placed in his twoman cell for the night 
the warden said he had no details on what calls bakker made 
baksides had an agreement not 
to reveal the nature of the sanctions i could only confirm what 
the turkish spokesman said today the us official told the 
associated press 
the senate committee approved the measure despite a fullscale 
lobbying campaign by the turkish government against it 
the government has taken the sanctions to put pressure on the 
us administration to make efforts to block the adoption of the 
resolution by the full senate said a government official speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
he said the defense cooperation pact between turkey and the 
united states could be jeopardized when it comes up for renewal 
next year if the senate approves the measure 
the united states maintains its military installations in turkey 
under this defense pact 
no date has been set for full consideration by the senate

a judge sent evangelist jim bakker 
directly to jail to start a 45year sentence for defrauding 
followers of millions of dollars saying people were sick of 
being saps for moneygrubbing preachers 
us district judge robert potter on tuesday also fined the 
defrocked ptl founder 500000 concluding that bakker had 
continued to milk the faithful even after his conviction for 
overselling memberships in a christian vacation retreat 
the 49yearold television evangelist left the courtroom in leg 
irons and handcuffs on his way to federal prison in alabama 
depending on the outcome of an appeal he will serve at least 10 
years before being eligible for parole 
two of bakkers former aides reported today to another 
minimumsecurity prison in alabama to begin serving sentences they 
received a month ago more than 18 years for david taggart and 17 
for his brother james 
prosecutors said the man who founded the once mighty ptl 
religious empire raised thousands of dollars since his oct 5th 
conviction and needed to be imprisoned to stop him from using tv 
and the mails to raise more 
hes able to walk out of this courtroom today and continue to 
perpetuate this fraud assistant us attorney jerry miller told 
the judge he hasnt blinked 
potter read a letter that bakker and his wife tammy faye 
mailed last month from their new tv ministry in orlando fla 
asking 300 supporters to send in 1000 apiece to alleviate a 
financial crisis 
those of us who do have a religion are sick of being saps for 
moneygrubbing preachers and priests potter said worst of 
all it appears that mr bakker feels he was deserving of his gains 
from the little people who sent in their savings 
potter refrained from ordering bakker to make restitution to his 
victims saying that issue needed to be resolved in bankruptcy 
court 
bakkers fall from power began in 1987 with revelations about a 
sexual encounter with former church secretary jessica hahn who 
received hush money leading to the unraveling of the ministry 
im deeply sorry for those i have hurt bakker said before 
sentencing i have sinned but never in my life did i intend to 
defraud anyone 
prosecutors didnt accept his apology 
this man is a con man a common criminal said miller 
hes ready willing and able to pick it up where he left it off 
hes ready to go back to the henhouse 
bakker stood and stared straight ahead as the sentence was read 
potter then sent him to the mediumsecurity federal prison at 
talledega ala where he arrived late tuesday 
warden don southerland said bakker was to spend the night in a 
cell with another inmate and remain there a few weeks before being 
assigned to another institution 
defense attorney harold bender had asked that bakker be freed on 
bond pending an appeal but potter said he posed a substantial 
flight risk 
he has supporters who think he can do no wrong and who say 
they are willing to do anything for him potter said i believe 
them 
bakkers 19yearold daughter tammy sue chapman was led 
sobbing from the courtroom mrs bakker did not attend the trial 
bakker was convicted of 23 counts of fraud and one count of 
conspiracy in an indictment that charged him with diverting 37 
million in ministry finances to finance his lavish lifestyle out of 
the 158 million sent him by followers 
bakker had faced a maximum sentence of 120 years but the judge 
consolidated the 24 counts to nine and sentenced bakker to five 
years on each potter known as maximum bob had given stiff 
sentences in the convictions of three top bakker aides richard 
dortch and the taggart brothers the three cooperated with the 
government in exchange for lightened sentences 
nearly 153000 people sent money to bakker between 1984 and 1987 
to become lifetime partners at the ptls heritage usa retreat 
in nearby fort mill sc bakker was convicted of selling 
guarantees of lodging at the retreat when he knew rooms werent 
available he spent contributors money on luxurious homes fancy 
cars jewelry vacations an airconditioned doghouse a swimming 
pool heated to 90 degrees and goldplated bathroom fixtures 
bakkers sixweek trial was delayed for three days in september 
when he suffered an emotional collapse claiming that wild animals 
were attacking him hurricane hugo caused a oneday delay 
bakker resigned ptl in march 1987 after it was revealed that he 
had paid hahn 265000 in ministry money to keep quiet about their 
1980 tryst 
hahn applauded tuesdays sentence 
it cannot repay those millions of dollars and the years of 
work people did to make it but at least its a start she said 
in a telephone interview from her west hollwood calif home at 
least people can feel like they wont be taken for fools 
jim bakkers no crook said bakker supporter helen gordon 
the news media made him look like one

rubble to find them

said rebecca lance vivarium manager we just grabbed them up and 
threw them into a huge garbage bucket 
the vivarium home to 10000 lizards snakes amphibians and 
rodents is about 50 feet from the quakeruined section of 
interstate 880 employees ran to help the human victims when they

footlong dumeril boa constrictors three 600 monitor lizards and 
assorted reptiles worth 35 to 500 each

behind pictures on the wall hanging from the picture wires we 
found them under cages on top of cages at one point i changed 
from tennis shoes to boots when i went back to put my tennis shoes 
on i found a snake in each shoe

cocaineproducing and consuming nations 
wrapped up a twoday meeting wednesday agreeing to tighten their 
dragnet on drug traffickers and encourage coca farmers to plant 
other cash crops 
spain and other european countries that have seen a dramatic 
expansion in the drug trade in recent years pledged greater 
involvement 
this meeting represents a great step forward in broadbased 
material support by the major european countries said acting 
us assistant attorney general edward dennis adding it would 
not be helpful to elaborate on the specifics of material offered 
he said the group also agreed to work toward streamlining the 
extradition process and establish a network of treaties that will 
eliminate any hiding place in the world for drug traffickers 
the meeting brought representatives of the 12nation european 
economic community the united states and colombia peru and 
bolivia together for the first time to discuss material and legal 
methods to halt the flow of cocaine 
in the past three years the amount of cocaine seized in the eec 
has tripled as drug traffickers turn from the united states in 
search of new markets 
an official said cocaine seizures in spain last year represented 
62 percent of the eec total of about six tons and that italy is 
another major point of entry into europe 
we feel that the recognition by eec countries of our 
situation represents a rather big step forward said armando 
lecaroz perus special drug ambassador 
spanish interior minister jose luis corcuera said the group 
agreed on the importance of investigating and halting the 
laundering of drug money and would look into ways to control the 
export from eec countries of chemicals used to transform coca leave 
paste into cocaine 
on tuesday at the close of a hispanofrench summit in the 
spanish city of valladolid french president francois mitterrand 
called for a crackdown on moneylaundering and said banks will 
have to open up their books and their accounts 
most of the worlds coca leaves are grown in the andean 
highlands of peru and bolivia most of the coca leave paste is 
processed into cocaine and shipped to the rest of the world from 
colombia 
representatives of all three producer countries stressed the 
importance of crop substitution programs to wean growers away from 
coca as well as export incentives and financing to make substitute 
crops commercially attractive 
participants agreed in a final communique to draw up and secure 
funding for appropriate crop substitution programs 
spains special drug coordinator miguel solans said concrete aid 
in the form of vehicles training of police and narcotics agents 
weapons and judicial protection programs would be negotiated 
bilaterally

former president ronald reagan on wednesday urged 
japan to leave a great legacy of its golden age to history by 
helping poland and other communist countries achieve freedom and 
democracy 
this is a golden age for japan reagan told some 600 people 
attending a banquet in his honor a genuine golden age provides 
the world with a distinctive idea a philosophy a cause a greater 
good

freedom and democracy particularly in communist countries moving 
toward democracy 
great endeavors make great nations let japan undertake this 
great endeavor to help save poland hungary and eastern europe i 
know you will he said 
in a television interview earlier in the day the 78yearold 
former president said the united states and japan are good friends 
who have made significant progress in their sometimes rocky trade 
relations 
there are just a few little itchy things here and there that 
we still are working on from both sides and part of our problem is 
our own congress that we have to bring into line reagan said 
japans trade surplus with the united states last year totaled 
52 billion according to us figures 
reagan said he believes sony corps recent purchase of columbia

determined to do our best to serve as a communication medium 
between the japan and the united states 
fujisankei officials have refused comment on reports the reagans

the house today sustained president bushs 
veto of a bill that would have allowed federally financed medicaid 
abortions for victims of rape and incest 
the vote was 231 to 191 in favor of override but that fell 51 
votes short of the twothirds margin needed 
abortionrights supporters who had won a surprising victory two 
weeks ago for more liberal abortion provisions failed in todays 
vote to end a prohibition that has been written in federal law for 
nearly a decade 
supporters of expanding federally financed abortions for poor 
women had acknowledged they faced a difficult task in trying to 
raise a twothirds house majority for an override they won a 
216206 vote two weeks ago 
an override also would have require twothirds approval by the 
senate 
the vote followed an emotionpacked debate on the house floor 
in which abortionrights forces condemned bushs veto as an 
unconscionable infringement on the rights of poor women and 
children victimized by rape and incest and one that will bring 
political damage to republicans 
abortion foes cast the issue as a moral one that would invite 
widespread federal financing of abortions 
this president cant stop panamanian leader manuel antonio 
noriega he cant decide what to do to roll back communism but 
boy can he show the poor women of this country whos boss said 
rep les aucoin dore a leader of abortionrights lawmakers 
if youre a poor woman george bush is saying to you just 
say no to rape just say no to incest what a leader aucoin 
said 
rep christopher smith rnj a leader of the antiabortion 
forces said the measure was vague imprecise and if enacted 
into law might open the floodgates to aboriton funding 
another abortion foe rep henry hyde rill said i have 
letters here from women who have been raped who say thank god i 
didnt have an abortion 
in an indication of how politically difficult the issue was 
regarded the house republican leader rep robert michel rill 
said he would vote with bush while suggesting he could change 
positions later 
im obliged obviously as the leader to support the president 
in this effort michel said that isnt to say that sometime 
down the road that position wont be modified to some degree but i 
think we ought to talk about it 
the liberalized abortion language passed the house on a 216206 
vote two weeks ago the measure which cleared the senate by a 
wider margin is part of a 1567 billion appropriations bill for 
education labor and health programs 
one democrat who had voted against the liberalization told the 
house today he would change positions and vote to overrride rep 
william natcher dky chairman of the appropriations subcommittee 
that wrote the spending bill said i like george bush but 
mr speaker hes wrong this time 
bush said he was seeking room for flexibility on the issue 
immediately after the house vote but under pressure from 
antiabortion supporters he hardened his stand and vetoed the bill 
saturday 
meanwhile white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today the 
passage of tougher restrictions on abortion by the pennsylvania 
house on tuesday certainly does show that theres strong feelings 
on both sides of this issue he said the president has no plans 
to campaign for passage of state laws restricting abortion 
on tuesday freshman rep frank pallone jr dnj reversed 
his previous stand and said he would vote in favor of an override 
i think its wrong for me as a congressman to dictate to women 
what decision they should make in the case of rape and 
incest said pallone who added he remains personally opposed to 
abortion 
the abortion provision would reverse a law in effect since 1981 
that bans all medicaid abortions for poor women except when the 
mothers life is endangered by her pregnancy 
although the senate has endorsed more liberal abortion 
provisions the house in previous years insisted on keeping the 
current law the house vote two weeks ago to accept the senate 
version surprised even its supporters 
the disputed provision would allow medicaid funding of abortions 
in cases of rape or incest when the victim reported promptly 
to health or law authorities 
although that was expected to cover a relatively narrow category 
of women the issue has taken on broader symbolic importance in the 
political fight over abortion 
it comes at a time when abortion rights supporters say they are 
benefiting from a changed political climate after the supreme court 
last summer gave the states more room to regulate abortions that 
ruling they contend has energized abortion rights supporters and

labor secretary elizabeth dole today named w 
j usery jr a longtime mediator and onetime labor secretary 
himself as supermediator for the 6monthold strike by the 
united mine workers against pittston coal group 
i believe that bill usery is precisely the right person to 
assist the parties in resolving what has thus far been a most 
difficult dispute mrs dole told reporters in making the 
announcement 
usery who agreed tuesday to try to settle the strike by 1700 
miners in three states said the public acrimony between the union 
and company gave him pause before he decided to accept 
this is one that you didnt jump at so quick usery said 
still usery said he would contact both sides immediately and that 
he hoped to resolve the strike before the upcoming holidays usery 
said he would meet separately with company and union officials 
first but wanted them to agree to a facetoface meeting soon 
usery labor secretary in the ford administration has an 
impressive record of settling strikes since leaving government he 
has headed a labor relations company in washington 
his skills will be tested in the umwpittston dispute the two 
sides refuse to negotiate facetoface and have been shuttling 
messages through federal mediators 
the strike began april 5 at pittston mines in virginia west 
virginia and kentucky the major dispute is over health and 
retirement benefits 
two weeks ago mrs dole met with strikers in carbo va and 
days later sat down with umw president richard trumka and pittston 
chairman paul douglas after that meeting she said she would name 
a supermediator 
as labor secretary usery sometimes stepped into contract 
disputes but mrs dole has resisted doing so 
i am not a mediator she said during her visit to the 
pittston facility im not here to say i have the answer to this 
complex problem but i do feel now it is time to see if we can 
facilitate the bargaining process 
userys resume includes helping end a sixmonth strike by the 
united auto workers against deere amp co in 1987 and a threeweek 
strike by chicago teachers in 1983 
he also helped settle a professional football strike in 1974 and 
has mediated dozens of disputes in the rubber auto electric 
hotel and transportation industries 
president nixon brought the hardwick ga native to washington 
in 1969 naming him assistant secretary of labor he was credited 
with helping settle railroad and airline labor disputes 
in 1973 he was named director of the federal mediation and 
conciliation service serving for three years until ford tapped him 
to head the labor department

a nineblock residential area was strewn 
with smoldering debris today after a series of explosions destroyed 
three homes killing two people and injuring 13 others 
its like a war zone theres a lot of damage conneaut 
mayor lewis shiley said after surveying the neighborhood 
a dozen agents from the us bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms were to search the rubble later today for clues of the 
explosion shiley said the mayor said it was presumed there were 
no more deaths officials earlier feared more victims might be in 
the wreckage 
its pretty much out theres still some smoldering chet 
arcaro conneaut building inspector said of the fire that broke 
out after the series of explosions about noon tuesday 
fire chief bim orrenmaa said officials were investigating the 
possibility that the 20 minutes of explosions of which the largest 
occurred midway through the series may have been caused by illegal 
fireworks 
i thought it was an earthquake said lori punkar who lives 
three blocks away in this town of 13000 people just west of the 
pennsylvania state line 
this felt like someone hit the house she said like a 
semi hit the house all the neighbors ran out in the street saying 
what was it 
wa west said the blast rocked his house two miles away we 
were eating lunch and it shook the floor i had no idea what it 
was 
orrenmaa said he saw what appeared to be firecrackers strewn 
around the house where the largest explosion occurred 
investigators had not yet determined whether all of the explosions 
occurred at the same house 
the fire chief said the pattern of the blasts led him to suspect 
illegal fireworks were involved and he summoned federal agents to 
investigate 
john kingsolver a special agent with the federal bureaus 
cleveland office also said items that resembled firecracker tubes 
had been spotted at one house he said federal investigators were 
warned of the possibility of more blasts while they examine the 
debris 
the county coroners office tentatively identified the two dead 
as people who lived in the area of the blast donald a rossi 56 
and june riddle described as elderly 
the only injured person to be hospitalized georgianna rossi 
46 was listed in satisfactory condition this morning at hamot 
medical center in erie pa about 25 miles east of conneaut she 
lived in the house where the largest explosion occurred 
twelve people were treated at brown memorial hospital in 
conneaut and released said hospital administrator george whitney 
orrenmaa originally put the death toll at three but later 
revised it to two

was denied a government spokesman said wednesday 
frank nesbitt who is accused of delivering unauthorized 
information to soviet agents requested citizenship when he was in 
moscow as a tourist in september said foreign ministry spokesman

the senate today overwhelmingly passed a 345 
billion relief package for earthquakedamaged northern california 
which substantially expands aid approved by the house 
by a vote of 971 the senate approved the plan and sent it back 
to the house as part of a wideranging spending bill which must 
reach president bushs desk tonight to keep the federal government 
from defaulting 
sen gordon humphrey rnh cast the only negative vote not 
voting were sens edward kennedy dmass and claiborne pell 
dri 
the senate accepted the housepassed 285 billion earthquake 
allocation and responding to pleas from california lawmakers 
added to it 600 million more for small business administration 
emergency loans 
california will be eligible to receive immediately 345 
billion said sen alan cranston dcalif it is very likely 
that the ultimate federal cost for the disaster may be higher 
for a community that has been badly shaken 
people who are dislocated from their homes and businesses need 
that assistance now said sen pete wilson rcalif who called 
the senate action generous and sensitive 
you have to go for what you can and weve done that said 
rep vic fazio dcalif who led his delegations unsuccessful 
effort in the house for even more money 38 billion 
the house measure passed 32199 on tuesday included 500 
million for the sba 11 billion for federal emergency management 
agency repair efforts and 1 billion for the federal highway 
administrations emergency fund it also set up a 250 million fund 
for bush to spend at his discretion 
in addition to expanding the sba money the senate approved 
waivers of federal rules denied in the house bill that would let 
the state get more federal money quickly with less commitment of 
local and state funds 
cranston estimated the total cost of the damage to the san 
francisco bay area from the oct 17 earthquake exceeded 7 billion 
quick senate action was needed because the aid was attached to a 
stopgap spending bill needed to avert a government shutdown 
thursday the bill is required because congress and the president 
have failed to enact 11 of the 13 annual appropriations bills 
required for the government to operate in fiscal 1990 which began 
oct 1 
a top house leadership aide said he expected a modest expansion 
in the senate would be acceptable in that chamber both houses must 
agree on a single version before it can be sent to the president 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday the 
president could accept the house version of the assistance plan 
the administration had proposed 15 billion in new federal 
spending plus earmarking another 1 billion for quake relief 
because of the urgency of the situation the californians said 
they were seeking as much as they could get now while the quake is 
still fresh on the nations consciousness but would come back for 
more later 
let me be honest fazio said if we dont accomplish 
everything we set out to accomplish well have to come back again 
and again and again but we understand that in six months 
well be just another budgetary problem 
the allocation for the quake approved by the house was already 
several times larger than any previous disaster aid package 
because of the extent of the damage the senate plan would waive 
or greatly expand legal limits to the federal obligation 
for example one waiver would allow the federal government to 
pay for repairing the san franciscooakland bay bridge a vital 
link that is a toll road and thus not eligible for such aid 
the plan also would extend from 90 days to 180 days the period 
during which the state could get 100 percent federal reimbursement 
for road repairs and the cost of earthquake repairs would be kept 
separate from the states normal allocation from the highway trust 
fund so it would not slow road projects elsewhere in the state

the federal emergency management agency is 
moving ahead with a program that will offer lower flood insurance 
rates in communities that work harder to reduce risks of flood 
damage officials said wednesday 
harold t duryee head of femas federal insurance 
administration said the agency is setting a dec 15 1990 
deadline for initial applications from communities seeking to 
qualify for premium adjustments under the program called the 
community rating system 
the first flood insurance rate cuts will take effect oct 1 
1991 in communities that qualify for them he said 
duryee said the agency also is trying to simplify procedures 
involved with the flood insurance program noting criticism in some 
communities that the program was so complex that people didnt 
want to fuss with all that was necessary to get coverage 
frank reilly the fias deputy administrator said about 2000 
out of the nearly 18000 communities now participating in the 
national flood insurance program will apply for premium reductions 
under the new rating system 
currently there are more than 21 million federal flood 
insurance policies in force over the last 10 years 350000 
insurance losses have been paid out for a total of 25 billion 
an fia summary of the community rating system said its goals are 
to are to encourage by the use of flood insurance premium 
adjustments community and state activities beyond those required 
by the national flood insurance program to reduce flood losses 
facilitate accurate insurance rating and promote the awareness of 
flood insurance 
not only does such a system properly reward those communities 
that are doing more than the minimum to protect their residents 
from flood losses it will will encourage communities to initiate 
new flood protection activities the paper said

a disgruntled former contra leader lashed out 
wednesday at us financing for the opposition political coalition 
in nicaragua charging the money is going for votebuying and will 
cause corruption on a big scale 
edgar chamorro who describes himself as the ciaselected 
director of contra communications from 1982 to 1984 said the 9 
million in national endowment for democracy funds equals 2 billion 
in his poor central american country 
the bush administration last week received congressional 
approval for the aid to help the coalition in its february 
electoral fight against the leftist sandinista government 
the congressional vote for this form of intervention 
represents an essential agreement between the bush administration 
and the democratcontrolled congress that the attempt to overturn 
the sandinista government by armed force has failed he said at a 
news conference 
congress cut off military aid to the contra rebels in 1988 the 
10000 or so troops most of whom are based in honduras receive 
nonlethal aid 
chamorro also charged that presidential candidate violeta 
chamorro who is not related to him received the nomination 
because of votebuying 
people received money to get her elected he said i have 
heard this directly from friends and witnesses he offered no 
other proof or testimony 
chamorro also charged that opposition leaders planned to use 
more than 25 million in american funds for salaries cars and 
paid vacations 
these are merely the current overt funds chamorro said 
an agency for international development official speaking on 
the condition of anonymity said a draft budget had been presented 
by the opposition coalition but no decisions had been reached 
it will be closely monitored he said 
chamorro said the cia still supplies the opposition working out 
of honduras and costa rica 
he said contra combatants continued carrying out armed 
propaganda activities murdering electoral officials and sandinista 
political activists and warning peasants against voting for the 
sandinistas 
chamorro says he is a nonsandinista nicaraguan but faulted 
the government only for not cracking down on the large sums of 
money coming into the country for the elections 2 million of 
which goes to the governments electoral council 
i think nicaragua was wrong in accepting that money he 
said this is corruption on a big scale 
chamorro returned to live in nicaragua in 1987 and he now heads 
the managua office of the center for the study of democratic 
systems a group he said will observe the observers in the 
nicaraguan elections that organization is an offshoot of the new 
yorkbased institute for media analysis made up mostly of 
americans opposed to the us support for the contra rebels

investigating incidents at a high school that prompted transfer 
requests from a black teacher and three black students 
officials from the civil rights division and other civilrights 
agencies plan to visit evergreen high school next week division 
public information officer judy fester said tuesday 
evergreen language arts teacher joseph knight submitted a 
transfer request to the jefferson county school district last 
friday after receiving an unsigned note containing a racist threat 
the note was very physically threatening knight 35 said 
tuesday life death that sort of thing i simply cant work 
in fear and i wont 
knight is on paid administrative leave while his transfer 
request is considered 
several weeks ago three black students the sons of evergreen 
residents norm and joan burkett withdrew from the school after 
hearing that some students rigged a homecoming contest against them 
because they are black their mother resigned as president of the 
parent teachers association 
the students said that earlier racist graffiti and slurs against 
blacks and jews contributed to their decision to leave the school

fifteen japaneseamericans whose graduation 
from high school was thwarted by world war ii will receive diplomas 
they earned 47 years ago 
the students who are scheduled to receive their diplomas 
saturday were among those detained in the sincediscredited 
wartime policy of relocating japaneseamericans to internment camps 
as possible enemy sympathizers 
our rights were denied us all these years said hayao 
shishino a retired cook who lives in cerritos we want to be on 
the rolls of the class of 1942 
most of the high school seniors sent to internment camps went on 
to receive diplomas from correspondence courses or at their 25th 
anniversary class reunion in 1967 but shishino and other former 
students wanted diplomas dated 1942 
he successfully appealed to los angeles school board member 
warren furutani whose motherinlaw was among the classmates 
refused diplomas 
the most important part of this episode is that it is a living 
history lesson we have an opportunity to go back and set the 
record straight furutani said 
shishino helped set up the weekend ceremony which 11 of the 
former los angeles high school students are expected to attend one 
diploma will be awarded posthumously

despite calls for less state regulation and more 
power for schools to improve themselves most states are still 
calling the shots on education reform according to a new report 
states have made only modest educational gains since the 1983 
federal report a nation at risk ushered in the reform era with 
its verdict that us schools were mired in mediocrity according 
to the report the progress of reform an appraisal of state 
education initiatives 
the report released wednesday concluded that state reform 
packages generally lacked coherence and only a few states such 
as washington arkansas maine and massachusetts have programs 
aimed at encouraging local districts to find creative ways of 
improving classroom instruction 
current rhetoric holds that the reform movement went through a 
first wave from 198286 mostly dictated from on high by 
states during which teacher and student standards were stiffened 
from 1986 on a second wave of reform often called 
restructuring is said to have moved beyond standards to 
improving teaching and learning at the school site 
president bush at his education summit with the nations 
governors last month put his stamp of approval on this second 
wave endorsing the principles of less educational red tape and 
more power for teachers and others at school sites to meet reform 
mandates 
but the study concludes that this second wave of reform remains 
wishful thinking in most states future objectives such as 
redistributing education funds from rich to poor districts and 
giving teachers and parents more authority will be far tougher if 
not impossible to achieve 
if were going to get those kinds of things people are going 
to have to be willing to stay at it for a long time william a 
firestone associate professor of education at rutgers university 
and coauthor of the report said in a telephone interview wednesday 
a few pioneering districts such as rochester ny and dade 
county fla have active local restructuring strategies but 
states are still enacting policies more characteristie globe that you 
will also be known as

the postmark had been removed chemically and the stamps regummed 
said a post office spokesman 
several people were being questioned following raids across 
britain by police and 75 postal investigators the spokesman said 
billions of stamps were reportedly seized many of which had 
been sent unwittingly to the fraud ring by charities the spokesman 
said 
the charities believed they were sending the stamps to dealers 
who repackage them for sale to collectors the spokesman said 
the post office said it was alerted to a possible fraud a year 
ago when revenue from stamps didnt tally with the volume of mail 
the alleged plot involved outsiders not post office employees

president bush declared today that nicaragua 
poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the united states and announced he 
will continue the us embargo against the central american country 
the trade embargo against the nation of 3 million was imposed by 
president reagan on may 1 1985 it bars imports from nicaragua and 
bans us exports to that country except to support the contra 
rebels fighting the leftist sandinista government it also 
prohibits nicaraguan aircraft or boats from entering the united 
states 
in related developments secretary of state james a baker iii 
said the united states protested as recently as today to the soviet 
union about continued shipments of eastbloc arms from nicaragua to 
leftist rebels in el salvador 
baker briefing reporters on bushs upcoming trip to costa rica 
also said the president would not meet with nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega this weekend during a celebration of a century of 
democracy in costa rica 
i doubt that he would refuse to speak if spoken to but hes 
not going to be meeting with him and not going to be extending any 
courtesies said baker 
he also said bush was likely to use the gathering in costa rica 
to be attended by 19 heads of state to further keep up the 
pressure for the ouster of panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega 
from power and to talk about the war on drugs 
the secretary said the administration continues to have concern 
that in the upcoming nicaraguan elections the opposition parties 
there will not be given adequate and sufficient access to the media 
to make the election free and fair 
nicaragua clearly continues to ship arms to leftist rebels 
in el salvador baker said citing the fact that a truck was 
stopped here at the hunduran border a day or so ago that had 
eastbloc arms in it 
it is a major problem that we have called to the attention of 
the soviet union and called to their attention as recently as 
today baker said 
the soviet union has denied any role in such arms shipments 
weve had an extended dialogue with the soviet union about the 
importance of using their influence to stop that kind of 
activity baker added the soviets told us they are going to 
use their best efforts to do that 
baker said he was willing to give the soviets the benefit of the 
doubt since soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze had 
recently been in nicaragua it would appear to me the nicaraguans 
are telling them one thing and doing something else he said 
baker said a prerequisite for such a meeting was for ortega to 
first meet with the nicaraguan resistance the contras who have 
been supported by both the reagan and bush administrations 
we think he ought to meet with his own people before he meets 
with us baker said he has continued to refuse to do that 
bush in a sixmonth report to congress on the status of the 
nicaragua embargo said the trade sanctions are an essential 
element of our policy that seeks a democratic outcome in nicaragua 
by diplomatic means 
the bush administration wants to see ortegas government voted 
out of office in the election next feb 25 and contends that 
election preparations unfairly benefit the ruling sandinistas 
the policies and actions of the government of nicaragua 
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security and foreign policy of the united states bush 
said 
i do not believe that current conditions in nicaragua justify 
lifting the trade sanctions he wrote he added that if ortega 
holds fair elections and implements democratic reforms as he 
promised in a regional agreement with other central american 
presidents the emergency that prompted the imposition of the 
trade sanctions would largely be resolved

lawmakers from north korea and south 
korea set aside their agenda wednesday and traded accusations of 
dictatorship and human rights abuses casting doubt on any quick 
breakthrough toward easing tension 
delegates from the two sides clashed when communist north korea 
opened the talks at this truce village by demanding south korea 
release three jailed dissidents and get all us troops to withdraw 
chief south korean delegate chai munshick responded by saying 
north korea should stop interfering in the souths internal affairs 
and said the pyongyang government must abandon dictatorial rule 
and protect human rights 
the senior north korean delegate chun kum chol reacted 
angrily your accusations are nonsense 
after reading prepared statements repeating their uncompromising 
stands both sides traded unusually hostile accusations for more 
than three hours but agreed to meet again nov 29 
wednesdays meeting the first since december was called to set 
terms for a joint session of the two koreas legislatures to work 
out various tensioneasing measures on the peninsula including a 
nonaggression pact 
the nations clashed over similar subjects at red cross sports 
and other talks earlier this month but their exchanges were not as 
hostile as wednesday 
the chief north korean delegate chun argued that the three 
jailed south korean dissidents christian pastor moon ikhwan 
opposition lawmaker suh kyungwon and radical student im sukyong 
were patriots who wanted reunification of the divided peninsula 
and demanded their immediate release 
the three dissidents were arrested between april and august for 
making illegal trips to north korea an enemy country 
the seoul government bans unauthorized visits to north korea and 
maintains dialogue on national unification must be carried on only 
through official channels the two koreas do not allow their 
citizens to visit each other or cross the heavily guarded border 
the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
the capitalist south in 1945 at the end of world war ii and the two 
nations remain bitter enemies after fighting a bloody war from

secretary of state james a baker iii offered 
today to review his proposal for talks between israel and 
palestinian arabs but said overhauling it could delay negotiations 
we think the five points are reasonable we think the five 
points are clear baker told a white house news conference 
referring to the major provisions of the us proposal 
israeli foreign minister moshe arens in a letter to baker 
delivered monday night accepted the us package in principle 
provided his government was assured the palestine liberation 
organization would be excluded and that the talks would deal 
entirely with holding elections on the west bank and in gaza 
i think that we want to do everything we can to try and move 
things forward baker said and therefore we will review the 
suggested changes we have received 
however he added if we start making changes for one side we 
will find ourselves in an extended negotiating session in terms of 
making changes that might be requested it would be much better 
if both sides would accept the five points as a general framework 
for moving forward and then lets get about the hard nittygritty 
business of sitting down facetoface and deciding what the rules 
are that would govern the conduct of elections 
baker described his mood as realistic neither optimisic nor 
pessimistic after reading arens letter and talking to him tuesday 
on the telephone 
but he went on to say over the last week or so many people 
have wanted to basically write this effort off they wanted to 
declare it dead the events of the last two or three days at least 
indicate that the effort has life in it 
arens told baker in the letter delivered by israeli ambassador 
moshe arad on monday night that the plo must be excluded and the 
agenda limited to the mechanics of conducting elections among the 
14 million palestinians who live on the west bank and in gaza 
baker had already offered assurances he was not trying to 
pressure israel into dealing with the plo and that israel would 
have the right to determine beforehand if it was satisfied with 
the palestinian delegation 
arens asked baker to harden those assurances while baker is 
trying to persuade the plo through egyptian intermediaries to 
permit palestinians in the israeliheld territories to engage in 
negotiations with israel 
without a green light from yasser arafats organization it is 
extremely unlikely palestinians will step forward israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir in a letter last week to baker said they 
were being subjected to intimidation 
the plos central committee meeting last week in baghdad iraq 
insisted that only the plo had the authority to represent 
palestinians and to select the delegation but margaret tutwiler 
the state department spokeswoman said tuesday that did not mean 
the plo had rejected bakers initiative 
baker talked again to arens on tuesday reaching him by 
telephone in brussels where the israeli foreign minister is meeting 
with belgian and european common market officials as well as with a 
group of israeli ambassadors based in europe 
the contents of their conversation were not disclosed but it 
was learned baker and arens concluded they had a basis to keep 
working together toward shamirs goal of holding elections among 
the palestinians 
arens in an interview broadcast today on israel radio said 
however he was adamant that the formula for talks with 
palestinians not deviate in any way from the israeli governments 
peace initiative 
baker also talked by telephone with egyptian foreign minister 
esmat abdel meguid who was in cairo 
publicly the state department welcomed arens letter to baker 
and said through ms tutwiler it reinforces what we believe 
that they are engaged and that they are working really hard to try 
to bridge these gaps 
shamir while touring the golan heights meanwhile described 
the recently steppedup exchange with the bush administration as 
positive i dont see any large gap between our views and the 
proposals of the secretary of state he told reporters but 
there are some differences 
israels labor party opposition stressed those differences i 
dont see anything in bakers proposal that needs to be changed 
said shimon peres the labor leader who is also finance minister 
shamir said israel would agree to the baker plan after the 
changes we proposed are accepted the prime minister added in 
a few days we will know if there is an agreement or not 
only one of bakers five points has been publicly acknowledged 
by the state department it provides for a threeway meeting of 
israel egypt and the united states in washington after israel 
meets with palestinians but before the elections are held 
the other provisions are that the israelipalestinian talks be 
held that the elections are the focus that israel is to be 
satisfied with the palestinian delegations composition and 
that egyptian president hosni mubarak is free to consult any middle 
eastern parties about the makeup of the delegation 
shamirs proposal is that palestinians elected on the west bank 
and in gaza would make arrangements with israel for five years of 
limited selfrule after this trial run palestinians together with 
jordan and egypt would negotiate an overall settlement with israel

crews began searching with heavy 
equipment today to clear tons of twisted blackened rubble at a 
plastics plant where a series of explosions and fire may have 
killed up to 22 workers officials said 
the body of third plant worker was recovered today officials 
said 
in addition a worker who had been among the missing was 
accounted for said bob benz manager of the pasadena plant that 
reduced the number of presumed dead to 19 not counting the three 
workers whose bodies were found but not yet identified 
the worker accounted for today was not at the plant during the 
monday afternoon explosion benz said 
they have moved in equipment overnight and they are beginning 
the process of searching for the missing said dick robinson 
phillips director of community affairs its liable to be a slow 
process but they are working in that area now and well take 
whatever time it takes to find them 
robinson indicated it was unlikely that anyone in the debris is 
still alive 
we always hope for the best but he trailed off 
miles of charred strings of pipe from mondays accident were 
piled haphazardly around the phillips petroleum co plant some 
buildings are gone and eight giant reactors now look like huge 
smashed tin cans 
any employee in that wreckage probably didnt survive said 
jere smith phillips director of public relations looking at the 
scene 
officials at the companys bartlesville okla headquarters 
late tuesday released a list of missing phillips employees 
the plants emergency alarm system had been tested and was 
problemfree hours before the explosions said greg derrick a 
phillips spokesman in bartlesville 
smith said officials were mobilizing heavy cranes and bulldozers 
to remove the wreckage the effort would proceed slowly as crews 
look for victims while removing debris he said 
the devastation in the plant is a whole lot more extensive 
than we thought said harris county sheriff johnny klevenhagen 
some of the buildings are gone theres nothing there others are 
crushed in flattened 
frantic relatives gathered and scanned lists of known survivors 
many held a vigil outside the complex which produces 45 million 
pounds a day of plastics used in milk jugs and grocery sacks 
mary de la vergne 38 found the name of her commonlaw husband 
cipriana rodriguez 43 on the list of missing workers 
i had just taken him lunch said ms de la vergne dressed 
in black i heard the explosion when i was going back home 
i can only keep on hoping she said collapsing into tears 
of the 124 injured in the blast 35 remained hospitalized 
tuesday with as many as six people in critical condition robinson 
said doctors would be reporting to phillips officials later today 
with updates on the employees conditions 
officials dont know yet exactly what caused the explosions 
which stemmed from a leaking chemical reactor at least two 
government agencies have joined phillips in assessing the damage 
were going to do a thorough investigation not only in 
procedures not only in systems but in training the employees had 
to assure ourselves that every precaution was taken said gilbert 
saulter regional administrator for the occupation safety and 
health administration 
union officials say they are questioning work schedules that may 
have left less experienced or tired employees on the job 
we feel like the number of hours that have been put in 
particularly by some maintenance classifications and the 
contractors the number of them that are in there working and the 
lack of training on their part it is a safety measure that may 
have contributed to the blast said wt walker representative of 
the oil chemical and atomic workers union local 4227 
worker james westerfield 37 said he saw a red fireball 
eating up everything in sight he began running out but stopped 
to carry an injured coworker gary bogle 
westerfield shrugged as he looked at smoke rising from the plant 
on tuesday and said he deserved no special mention 
there aint no heroes out here he said it was just 
everybody trying to help everybody else 
the plant exploded in a series of blasts monday afternoon 
sending metal and concrete debris flying as far as six miles the 
blast bent nearby railroad warning signs twentyfive miles away 
the ground shook 
authorities said it will be days and perhaps weeks before the 
missing workers are found 
the second victim was found tuesday but the body could not 
immediately be recovered because it was partly buried in mounds of 
concrete and steel beams the first fatality was discovered monday 
night but officials have not yet identified either person 
the area where authorities believe most of the missing workers 
are entombed is a twisted jumble of rubble and debris 
its going to take extremely heavy equipment to remove the 
debris were going to have to bring in a bulldozer to make a 
road the sheriff said smith said phillips likely will rebuild 
at the site but added he was uncertain what type of facility would 
replace it 
workers whose jobs were displaced by the explosion will continue 
to be paid he said but some may be laid off later phillips also 
will try to find work for some of the workers at the companys 
other operations in nearby houston and sweeny 
more than 900 people worked in three shifts at the plant built 
in 1948 on an 800acre complex

crackinfested crimeridden lowincome housing project 
and as the fourth fifth and sixthgraders trickled back to 
class this week they were encouragd to talk about their personal 
fears to help soothe any psychological jolts left over from the 
quake 
i thought i was going to die at first i thought it was the 
washing machine then we heard plates falling said jamaal brown 
10 
i saw cars crushed on the freeway and the bodies were in 
there its bad said one fourthgrader sitting crosslegged in 
a circle of children sharing his feelings with a group 
my grandmother had a heart attack said another 
my fish tank broke and all the fish died one added 
i tried to run but i couldnt i had to crawl a student 
said 
psychologists throughout northern california have encouraged 
schools to help children cope with the disruptions of the oct 17 
earthquake warning signs of anxiety are trouble sleeping clinging 
to parents or being excessively quiet 
children experience an earthquake differently said shirley 
reece chief social worker for child psycholology at langley porter 
psychiatric hospital of the university of california at san 
francisco 
they feel terribly powerless and if they see it in the papers 
or on tv the earthquake happens over and over they are simply 
being retraumatized she said 
at the cole school which is decorated for halloween students 
talked drew pictures and wrote quakerelated poems the building 
is one block away from interstate 880 and four blocks from a 
section of the elevated roadway that collapsed killing dozens of 
people 
there were special feelings about the plight of 6yearold julio 
berumen who was trapped in the carnage firefighters had to cut 
through his dead mothers body with a chain saw so doctors could 
amputate his right leg and free him 
they shouldnt have put that on the news about that boy that 
was terrible that was personal said toral george 10 
edson mejia a sixthgrader drew a picture in crayon of the 
doubledecked roadway it showed columns cracking in half cars 
sandwiched between layers of concrete and passengers in cars 
i felt sorry for the people stuck in there said mejia it 
sounded like a bomb 
about 135 people from the neighborhood were evacuated because 
officials feared stillstanding portions of the shaky roadway could 
fall some students require passes from police to pass under the 
road visible as the students jumped doubledutch rope and played 
basketball at recess 
every time they look at the freeway theyre reminded of it 
theyre reminded there are still bodies out there said 
sixthgrade teacher claudia bilbao 
there are other reminders near the cafeteria a seismometer was 
installed by columbia university to measure aftershocks teachers 
also used the device for their science classes 
one tangible fear was aftershocks and reports that the quake 
that hit as devastating as it was wasnt even the big one that 
scientists fear 
theres going to be another one its going to be so big the 
ground will open up and well all fall in a hole said spirit

local governments that urged peasants to grow 
more grain are too short of cash to buy the bumper harvest leaving 
angry peasants with grain they cant sell or store an official 
report said wednesday 
ever since spring planting time chinese leaders have been 
urging peasants to grasp grain production and plant grain 
rather than more profitable crops in order to help china become 
selfsufficient in grain 
many peasants did and now they are mad the peasants daily 
said 
this years crop is estimated to top 400 million tons making it 
the highest since 1984 but because of the governments yearold 
economic austerity program which has sharply cut bank credit many 
county grain bureaus have no cash to buy the crop 
what they do buy they cant sell because regional grain bureaus 
the next step in the state purchase system also have no money 
the paper said 
county grain storage facilities are overflowing it said and in 
one county in central china 100000 tons are being stored in the 
open and face danger of turning moldy in another county peasants 
have been stuck with more than 100000 tons in their homes 
the states inability to buy the crop has depressed free market 
prices and in central chinas henan province some peasants have 
sold grain at firesale prices to itinerate profiteers to get it 
off their hands the paper said 
all peasants contract with the state to sell a fixed amount of 
grain but they can sell the rest on the free market in past 
years free market prices were higher than state prices and in some 
areas local governments had trouble keeping peasants from selling 
their entire crops on the free market 
the government fears that if all grain were bought and sold on 
free markets the price would rise and trigger unrest in cities 
where residents are used to low statesubsidized prices 
the paper noted the irony of the situation 
two months earlier large numbers of officials rode in 
propaganda buses through the villages mobilizing peasants to sell 
more grain to the state this year it wrote two months later 
when the peasants carried their extra grain to the grain shop the 
grain shops one after another were closed the peasants 
furiously asked isnt this making fun of us field hands 
county governments dealt with a similar shortage of funds last 
year by issuing ious but that triggered protests and violent 
clashes in some places this year the government pledged to pay 
cash so that not taking the grain at all has become its only 
option 
the government has compounded its headache by recreating a state 
monopoly on buying cotton this year to keep a shortage of cotton 
from driving prices up the move means local governments must come 
up with even more funds than before 
the official china daily said last week that the central bank 
was distributing 5 billion in emergency funds to local banks to 
help buy the harvest the peasants daily did not say if this sum 
would be enough 
it called the problem one of circulation and urged 
responsible departments to think of solutions as soon as 
possible

the foreign ministry said wednesday it 
is investigating reports that its ambassador to bonn insulted a 
group of west german officials during an evening of heavy drinking 
the envoy albert hohl said he spent a boisterous evening 
with city officials from bonn and from basel switzerland on a 
rhine river cruise boat 
he said that in joking about swiss relations with the big 
neighbor to the north he mentioned an antigerman epithet the 
west germans did not take offense but the basel delegation later 
complained to the foreign ministry hohl told the associated press 
he dismissed a report wednesday by a basel magazine dementi 
that he insulted the german group and had to be dragged from the 
boat drunk 
swiss foreign ministry spokesman clemens birrer said an internal 
inquiry was launched against hohl after the sept 23 incident in 
which the ambassador was under a certain degree of alcohol 
influence hohl has been asked to respond officially to the 
allegations of poor conduct the spokesman said 
while official relations between the two countries are good 
opinion polls traditionally show that west germans are not very 
popular in switzerland

senate republicans stung by a drive by 
democrats to portray president bush as timid hesitant and weak 
described the critics wednesday as yapping dogs determined to 
rule or ruin 
theyre not interested in legislating said deputy 
republican leader alan simpson rwyo theyre just interested in 
seeing just who can ram it to the other side 
but senate majority leader george mitchell replying to a remark 
by bush on tuesday that he was tired of taking hits from 
opponents said the president has no reason to complain 
the president doesnt mind criticizing others but doesnt want 
to be criticized himself the maine democrat said 
he said criticism of the adequacy of the presidents proposals 
for poland and hungary was entirely justified because what the 
president proposed was inadequate 
mitchell house speaker tom foley dwash and most other 
democratic leaders have opened an aggressive campaign in recent 
weeks repeatedly using such words as weak and timid and 
woefully inadequate to describe bushs efforts on such issues 
as aid for eastern europe and the war against drugs 
on tuesday mitchell ripped into bushs drive to pass a capital 
gains tax cut accusing the administration of unfair tactics and 
declaring the capital gains tax has become the holy grail of 
this administration 
mitchell said the administration has cast aside any concern 
for the deficit it has cast aside any concern for the budget 
process it has now cast aside any concern for fairness and it has 
cast aside any concern for relations with this congress on the 
capital gains issue 
simpson told the senate that in making such statements mitchell 
and foley are reflecting heat from down below 
its heat from people who really dont like to legislate they 
just like to rule or ruin simpson said 
he said these young turk democrats were irritated with the 
early tendency of both mitchell and foley to accomodate the 
president and facilitate his programs 
they have been saying when are you going to stop that when 
are you going to hammer him get him forget the issues just get 
him 
simpson said he is not blaming mitchell or foley but is 
reserving his fire for those democrats whom he said insisted on a 
more aggressive strategy 
i think they grind their teeth at night simpson said 
adding 
theyre not interested in legislating they are just 
interested in seeing just who can ram it to the other side out of 
ambition they have a higher agenda and thats power and 
heaven forbid some of them even lust for the presidency 
and so they rattle the cage simpson said 
and they say things like the hesitancy presidency which is 
a dazzling phrase somebody cabbaged up timid thats another 
george bush has been through all of that simpson said in 
eight years as vice president he was called a wimp 
sycophant lapdog didnt faze him a bit 
so there wont be any response from george bush at these 
yapping dogs simpson said and there are yapping dogs out 
there 
actually bush did respond in an interview on tuesday with the 
new york times 
democrats on capitol hill have been calling me timid he 
said i have other better words like cautious diplomatic 
prudent

gen michel aoun called on legislators 
wednesday to reject a peace plan they passed during a special 
parliament session in saudi arabia and his hostility left him 
politically isolated even in his christian camp 
fearing aouns wrath might land them in jail some christian 
legislators delayed their return to beirut 
christian political militia and religious leaders declared 
cautious support for the accord the main political alliance urged 
lebanese leaders to show flexibility in dealing with it 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir of the maronite church was quoted in 
radio interviews from rome as supporting the plan which would 
shift political control from the christian minority to the moslem 
majority but reserve the presidency for a maronite 
aoun scorned it in a speech to young christian demonstrators at 
the warbattered remnants of the presidential palace east of beirut 
he repeated that he accepted the political reforms but rejected 
the accords lack of a deadline for the withdrawal of the 40000 
syrian troops in lebanon 
no to the accord of capitulation no to surrender the 
estimated 2000 demonstrators chanted waving posters of aoun and 
flags of lebanon 
parliament approved the plan sunday after 23 days of talks in 
the saudi resort of taif it is aimed at ending 14 years of civil 
war 
saudi arabia morocco and algeria assigned by the arab league 
to mediate the lebanon crisis urged parliament to convene by nov 
7 in beirut to formally approve it and elect a president 
the white house said the bush administration supports the accord 
the lebanese front alliance of rightwing christian groups 
declared support for the plan which was approved by 59 of the 62 
lawmakers at taif 
the fronts president george saadeh voted for it saadeh heads 
the phalange party the main christian political group in lebanon 
the lebanese front pleads with all officials and leaders to 
show flexibility in dealing with initiatives to settle the lebanese 
crisis a statement said 
saadeh and five deputies went to rome to seek church backing for 
the plan 
parliament deputy raymond edde a maronite catholic like aoun 
announced in paris that he will run for president 
edde who has been living in selfimposed exile following 
repeated attempts to assassinate him in lebanon was the first 
person to announce candidacy for the post 
lebanon has been without a president since sept 22 1988 when 
amin gemayels term expired and parliament was unable to decide on 
a successor 
gemayel named aoun head of an interim military cabinet pending 
election of a new president 
moslems rejected aouns appointment and swore allegiance to the 
cabinet of acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem 
one senior official in the phalange party speaking anonymously 
said aoun felt abandoned by the plan because it does not fulfull 
his goal of driving the syrians out of the country 
syrian troops were deployed in 1976 under an arab league mandate 
to quell the civil war aoun said they violated the mandate by 
siding with the moslems in the war 
the general rightfully feels he is left out in the cold he is 
the main loser as a result of the taif accord and it looks like 
hes not going to take it gracefully said the official

hundreds of artists and their supporters staged a 
national arts advocacy day on wednesday and warned that theaters 
museums and other institutions are being squeezed to death by 
government cutbacks 
subsidized theater in britain is as much under threat as the 
amazonian rain forests said richard eyre director of the royal 
national theatre 
the demonstrators rallied at the south bank arts center home of 
the royal festival hall and the national theater before heading to 
the house of commons to urge lawmakers to be more generous with 
funding for the arts 
john bowis a legislator for the governing conservative party 
said they would have to exert huge pressure because the arts 
were of little interest to most members of parliament or mps 
the last time i initiated a debate on the arts there were 
about 40 mps present out of 650 in the house of commons he said 
speakers accused the government of underestimating the value of 
the arts to british life and as a revenue earner more than 300 
people attended the rally organizers said 
britain has an artistic talent all round which is second to 
none but which is being squeezed to death said sir peter 
maxwell davies the composer and conductor 
years of belttightening by arts organizations are being wasted 
because of rising inflation said luke rittner the 
governmentappointed secretarygeneral of the arts council which 
distributes government arts subsidies he pleaded for another 64 
million of government aid over the next three years 
since prime minister margaret thatchers conservatives won power 
in 1979 government financial support for the arts has fallen by 19 
percent said simon crine director of the national campaign for 
the arts which organized the events 
total government spending this year on arts and libraries 
including the 19 national museums is officially estimated at 13 
billion of which 707 million is for the arts alone 
the arts council receives 245 million of that for drama music 
opera dance movies and videos touring companies and art 
exhibitions 
local authorities spend a further 316 million and business 
sponsorship amounts to 47 million 
arts organizers say the inflation rate of 76 percent has thrown 
many ensembles and projects into crisis and the governments own 
advisory body the museums and galleries commission said in july 
that inflation and wage increases have risen four times as much as 
its grants 
britains flagship arts center the heavily subsidized royal 
opera house has a projected deficit this year of nearly 4 
million the royal shakespeare company is more than 158 million 
in the red and the national theater the financially strongest of 
the trio only balanced its books this year by drawing on reserves 
the british museum faces the first deficit in its 236year 
history about 158 million largely because funding has failed to 
match civil service pay hikes said sir david wilson its director 
subsidized theater in britain is as much under threat as the 
amazonian rain forests said richard eyre director of the royal 
national theatre 
peter palumbo the millionaire real estate developer and 
chairman of the arts council said last week that britons should 
abandon the outdated perception of the arts as a recreational 
pastime for amateurs 
the arts are a major industry employing 500000 people and with 
an annual revenue of 19 billion he said

the ozone pollution reported in some cities 
last year was caused mostly by unusually hot weather not dirtier 
air an industrysupported analysis said wednesday 
the environmental community would have you believe we are in 
an ozone crisis but that is not the case said william d fay 
administrator of the clean air working group 
with the exceptions of los angeles houston and sometimes new 
york our cities are facing neither an ozone crisis nor an 
intractable ozone problem said fay 
dr michael oppenheimer of the environmental defense fund 
disagreed however contending that most of the eastern united 
states has too much ozone 
emissions and weather are the factors that affect pollution 
said oppenheimer emissions have been increasing with the improving 
economy he said and while 1988 was an unusual year if climate 
warming does occur as some scientisis fear that would increase 
future pollution levels 
congress is considering legislation which would tighten 
emissions standards for automobiles businesses and industry and 
last summers increased smog levels have been cited in debates over 
that measure 
several cities did record dramatic increases in the number of 
times their air quality failed to meet federal standards last year 
but kay h jones of the seattle research firm roy f weston 
inc said his analysis of ozone readings in more than 70 major 
cities shows that 1988 was an aberration 
for much of the nation the summer of 1988 was the hottest since 
the dust bowl years of the 1930s and the excessive heat generated 
more ozone in large cities jones said 
ozone a highly reactive form of oxygen is a major constituent 
of urban smog heat speeds the chemical reactions which form ozone 
conditions returned to nearly normal this past summer jones 
said for example he said atlanta exceeded ozone standards for 19 
days in 1988 and only once in 1989 for other cities the excessive 
days included baltimore 34 in 1988 and 2 in 1989 chicago 27 in 
1988 and 3 in 1989 new york 39 in 1988 and 12 in 1989 and 
washington 30 in 1988 n london metal exchange warehouse 
stocks and a pending strike vote at exxon corp mines in chile 
strikes and shutdowns that had been supporting prices for a 
while back are settled and copper is not in such tight supply 
said demler 
copper settled 35 to 45 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in october at 115 a pound 
also on the comex the steadier stock market and stronger dollar 
sent gold and silver futures slightly lower 
its been a pretty dead metals market lately with not much 
major news to generate any sudden shifts said diane meagher of 
deak international inc in chicago 
gold settled 1 to 110 lower with the contract for delivery 
in october at 36910 a troy ounce and silver was 34 cents to 35 
cents lower with october at 5114 a troy ounce 
oil futures prices were mostly higher in very light trading on 
the new york mercantile exchange 
futures were supported by a false rumor during the day that an 
earthquake had hit alaska said mike rothman senior oil anaylst 
for merrill lynch capital markets inc 
he also said traders were discounting the 6304 million barrels 
of crude oil listed in tuesdays american petroleum institute 
inventory report 
they believe stocks were depleted by the effects of hurricane 
jerry and there will be offsetting figures in next weeks 
report said rothman 
crude futures settled 10 cents lower to 23 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in november at 1883 a barrel heating 
oil was 20 cent lower to 05 cent higher with november at 5844 
cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline was 05 cent to 61 cent 
higher with november at 5340 a gallon 
futures prices for corn and soybeans climbed higher but wheat 
prices sagged on the chicago board of trade 
this weeks light trading continued for a third day with little 
outside news of any major consequence for the futures markets said 
susan leighty an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
lack of export demand and beneficial rains for both the south 
american and us winter crop were depressing wheat prices ms 
leighty said 
supporting futures prices was new soviet interest in the 
agricultural markets as the soviet union purchased 50000 metric 
tons of argentine meal and 350000 metric tons of corn from 
yugoslavia since tuesday said victor lespinasse a floor trader 
with dean witter reynolds inc 
wheat settled 1 cents to 6 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in december at 405 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 2 
cents higher with december at 242 a bushel oats were cent to 
1 cents lower with december at 146 a bushel and soybeans were 
3 cents to 6 cents higher with november at 566 a bushel 
on the chicago mercantile exchange livestock and pork prices 
were mostly higher 
we had a late rally in the final 20 minutes mostly on 
commission house buying said chicago analyst phil stanley of dec 
futures inc 
lighter supplies of cattle but not so light for hogs were 
affecting prices stanley said 
cattle settled 02 cent lower to 03 cent higher with the

the aut the first woman justice in the 
200year history of the supreme court gave chief justice william 
rehnquist the vote he had sought for 16 years a working majority 
to begin dismantling the roe decision written by fellow justice 
harry blackmun in 1973 
for now business continues as usual at most of the clinics and 
hospitals that annually perform legal abortions on three out of 
every 100 american women of childbearing age under the new ruling 
more than 95 percent could proceed without legal interruption 
because that is the proportion who get abortions earlier than the 
point at which the states may now intercede 
but with three more challenges to roe on the justices docket 
it may not be long before the court jettisons the landmark 1973 
decision entirely allowing states either to recriminalize all 
abortions or impose any of dozens of proposed restrictions ranging 
from mandatory parental or spousal consent to forced medical 
testing of the fetus and psychological counseling of the mother 
blackmun himself wrote that the signs his decision will be 
explicitly overturned are evident and very ominous and a chill 
wind blows 
some saw the missouri ruling as the grandest judicial 
affirmation to date of ronald reagans revolution others say it 
may prove ironically to unravel it the opinion of the courts 
majority simply is not shared by the majority of americans 
most polls including a media generalassociated press survey 
last summer say that by a 21 margin americans believe abortions 
should be legal but they are more evenly divided and in some 
cases tilt the other way on questions regarding public spending 
parental consent and related curbs 
charlotte taft director of a womens clinic in dallas puts t 
this way americans favor abortion only in the case of rape 
incest and their own personal circumstance 
democratic pollster peter hart says many republicans outside the 
religious right those in the suburban mainstream of the party 
have always given a wink and a nod to their candidates stated 
abortion views but now that the court has made abortion a hot 
political issue he says many will not find that acceptable 
anymore 
william schneider of the conservative american enterprise 
institute echoed that view when he warned gop politicians that 
suburban defections could drive a stake through the heart of the 
reagan coalition 
republican consultant roger stone however says the democratic 
party which unequivocally endorsed abortion rights in its platform 
last year stands to lose its last conservative bloc the urban 
bluecollar roman catholics 
there are no guarantees to any of these theories even the 
catholic coalition cannot be taken for granted despite the 
churchs vehement opposition to abortion indeed guttmacher 
researchers have found that catholic women are more likely to have 
an abortion than either protestant or jewish women probably 
because they practice less birth control another somewhat 
startling finding one out of every six women who have an abortion 
describes herself as an evangelical christian 
there will be some early clues on the political scene abortion 
is an issue in two gubernatorial races next month in new jersey 
and virginia as well as the mayoral contest in new york city and 
next year 36 gubernatorial races as well as the us house and a 
third of the senate will be fought 
the prochoice movement meanwhile is back on the march 
starting with a demonstration that drew more than 300000 people to 
the capital on the eve of the supreme courts hearing of the 
missouri case and it was buoyed last month by the florida 
legislatures wholesale rebuke of the antiabortion laws gov bob 
martinez tried to push through a special session moreover for the 
first time this decade the house and senate passed a bill that 
would have granted rape and incest victims federal assistance for 
abortions bush vetoed it this past week 
read our lips take our rights lose your jobs says kate 
michelman director of the national abortion rights action league 
at its 20th anniversary convention the league named nine 
politicians including martinez and sen jesse helms of north 
carolina as special targets for defeat next year 
according to larry sabato political scientist at the university 
of virginia abortion is likely to become the beirut of american 
politics a nowin issue california pollster mervin field says 
the nations 7500 state legislators are saying oh my god and 
wondering how they can control the damage 
the anitabortion movement meanwhile is content to take things 
one step at a time we believe the court will permit the states 
and congress to restrict the reasons for abortions says douglas 
johnson of the national right to life committee 
overall more than half the states are regarded as likely to 
enact some restrictions another eight to 10 are battlegrounds and 
10 to 15 are likely to retain full abortionondemand rights 
part of the strategy of abortion opponents is to create such a 
blizzard of consent and testing requirements that clinics and 
doctors will give up their abortion services as legally or 
financially risky the antiabortion shock troops meanwhile 
belong to operation rescue a largely white evangelical 
christian group that counts 35000 members and thousands of arrests 
while demonstrating at abortion clinics around the country 
typically its rescues entail forming a human blockade 
around the clinic while sidewalk counselors attempt to turn 
away the women trying to get through some protestors have entered 
clinics and damaged medical equipment with eggs and fake blood 
the group disowned by many in the antiabortion movement is 
led by young randall terry who carts a disfigured splotchy fetus 
he calls baby choice around the country in a jar of 
formaldehyde at news conferences he lays the fetus out in a tiny 
coffin lined with white satin terry a former usedcar salesman 
will point to the fetus and declare thats not a blob of cells 
thats a little girl 
operation rescue also distributes a video designed to evoke 
equal shock it features shots of aborted fetuses mixed with scenes 
of nazi concentration camps a somewhat milder video called the 
silent scream has been circulated for years by other 
antiabortion groups 
now the prochoice forces are distributing a video of their 
own produced by the fund for the feminist majority it is called 
abortion for survival and depicts an actual abortion that 
lasts 84 seconds and shows two aborted embryos amounting to about 
two tablespoons of blood and tissue the point is to demonstrate 
that what is swept from the womb in most abortions is not nearly 
the babylike figure depicted by the opposition 
whatever the tactics the abortion war looms like the civil 
rights struggle and vietnam as a long and painful one for the 
country the difference is that nobody predicts an end to this 
fight by law or by conscience

moving to ease consumer concerns over food 
safety president bush is preparing to announce a streamlining of 
regulations so that dangerous chemicals can be taken off the market 
more quickly sources said wednesday 
the administrations new policy for dealing with pesticides and 
other chemicals in foods is aimed at giving the environmental 
protection agency greater flexibility in dealing with food safety 
issues 
epa administrator william k reilly declined on wednesday to 
provide details of the impending policy announcement but told 
reporters its responsive to a number of problems this agency has 
had in administering our pesticide law 
the president is expected to announce the food safety initiative 
at the white house on thursday 
industry spokesmen reserved comment on the new policy until it 
is announced environmentalists said that while they welcome some 
aspects of the new policy they have concerns about other 
provisions 
according to sources familiar with the revision it will include 
a shift in the procedures used by the epa in determine whether a 
potentially dangerous pesticide should be taken off the market the 
epa no longer will be required to have a formal judicial hearing 
and may opt for a swifter rulemaking process that could 
significantly reduce the time it takes to ban a chemical 
environmentalists said that such a shift could reduce the time 
it takes to get a dangerous pesticide off the market from as long 
as eight years under current procedures to about two years 
if risks warrant the epa also will be given greater leeway in 
suspending use of pesticides and other chemicals used on foods 
while the formal proceedings get underway the sources said the 
agency will no longer have to prove an imminent hazard to 
public health to suspend a chemical as is required under current 
policy in some cases the agency will not have to take into 
account economic ramifications of its action in suspending a 
chemical 
the epa has been under attack from environmentalists for failing 
to act swiftly to protect the countrys food supply from dangerous 
levels of pesticide residues including carcinogens in foods 
especially on fruits and vegetables 
the issue gained widespread attention earlier this year when epa 
officials acknowledged that daminozide a growthregulating 
compound marketed under the name alar caused cancer but were 
unable to take it off the market immediately because the agency did 
believe it met the imminent hazard standard 
a public outcry over the use of alar on apples subsequently 
caused its manufacturer to stop selling the chemical voluntarily 
the maker of another widely used chemical the fungicide ebdc 
recently announced it was stopping sale of the compound for use on 
a variety of food crops but continued to make it available for use 
on many other fruits and vegetables the epa has been reviewing the 
status of ebdc since 1977 when it was discovered that a byproduct 
of the family of fungicides is a potential human carcinogen 
although the new administration policy will allow the epa to 
make more timely decisions on protecting foods from harmful 
pesticide residues the plan also contains provisions that are 
expected to be attacked by environmentalists 
the policy for example will relax the threshold at which a 
chemical in some cases will be considered to pose an unacceptable 
risk according to the sources who commented under the condition 
that they not be further identified 
the epa under current policy has said action is warranted if the 
risk of cancer or other serious illness is 1 in 1 million under 
the new policy the epa may choose not to act in some cases unless 
the risk is as great as 1 in 100000 
in addition the administration will propose that pesticide 
regulation be uniform across the country 
that according to environmentalists amounts to administration 
endorsement of congressional action to preempt states from 
imposing tougher pesticide laws than federal requirements 
jay feldman of the national coalition against the misuse of 
pesticides said any preemptive provision would be opposed by 
environmentalists most of the major federal actions in the past 
on pesticides have been preceded by state actions which serve as 
an important check and balance said feldman

president bush forcefully pressed for a clear 
shot at a senate vote on a lower capital gains tax in a meeting 
wednesday with senate democrats but was told his chances were 
slim participants said 
the lawmakers said after a white house meeting that they told 
bush his only realistic hope was to support a compromise package 
that included other items as well 
while balking at the notion of delaying action on such a measure 
until next year bush expressed willingness to discuss a compromise 
package said the senators 
sen tom harkin diowa said when he proposed that the capital 
gains change be linked with a higher minimum wage white house 
chief of staff john sununu put a pad in front of me and said 
write it out 
harkin was one of eight democrats invited to the white house by 
bush as the president continued to lobby democrats for a 
straightforward vote on the capital gains proposal 
the white house is seeking senate approval of a provision passed 
by the house that would lower the tax on capital gains profits 
from the sale of real estate stocks and other assets to 196 
percent for two years from the current maximum rate of 33 percent 
but the senate democratic leadership has resisted scheduling a 
simple vote on the measure and the white house in the past few 
days has stepped up its lobbying campaign 
if the administration continues to push for an upanddown 
vote on capital gains to the exclusion of everything else thats 
just not going to happen harkin said 
senators who met with bush said the president was repeatedly 
told there was little likelihood he would get a vote on a separate 
capital gains tax bill this year 
the blunt assessment was more substantial in that it came from a 
group of democrats who in the past had supported either a capital 
gains tax cut or some form of capital gains incentives 
bush met with harkin and sens brock adams of washington max 
baucus of montana christopher dodd of connecticut wyche fowler 
jr of georgia john glenn of ohio john f kerry of massachusetts 
and timothy e wirth of colorado 
participants said that in addition to the capital gains 
proposal the final package might include a democraticsponsored 
plan to expand coverage of individual retirement accounts as well 
as legislation to deal with the minimum wage and child care 
its clear that most people feel theyve got to resolve this 
in some sort of sensible way that involves compromises on both 
sides kerry told reporters 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president was agreeable to 
possible compromises on the proposal but did not suggest what 
form such a package might take 
we are working to pick up new votes all the time he said 
however it seemed unlikely bush picked up any in wednesdays 
session 
the president presented his position very forcefully glenn 
said 
participants said bush opened wednesdays meeting by denying 
that he was seeking to make the issue a holy grail as senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine had asserted on tuesday 
the house attached the capital gains cut to broader 
deficitreduction bill which is now in a housesenate conference 
committee 
the senate version does not contain the cut democrats have 
threatened to filibuster if the conference committee produces a 
compromise version containing the capital gains provision 
it would take 60 votes to shut off such a filibuster votes 
republicans do not appear to have 
negotiators from the senate and house began the efforts 
wednesday to work out a compromise between the different 
deficitreduction bills passed by the two chambers but made little 
headway

col moammar gadhafi for the first time 
acknowledged libya bankrolled terrorist groups but said he 
mistakenly thought the action would further the arab cause 
according to an interview published wednesday 
at one point we supported some of these groups without 
meticulously examining their aims and role the egyptian 
governmentowned weekly magazine almussawar quoted him as saying 
but when we discovered that these groups were causing more 
harm than benefit to the arab cause we halted our aid to them 
completely and withdrew our support he told almussawar editor 
makram mohammed ahmed a confidant of egyptian president hosni 
mubarak 
gadhafi also said he wants no confrontation with the united 
states and would welcome a dialogue toward friendlier relations 
the magazine said ahmed conducted the interview a week ago a 
day after gadhafi met with mubarak in tobruk on libyas 
mediterranean coast to discuss improving relations after 16 years 
of friction 
gadhafi a disciple of the late egyptian president gamal abdel 
nasser and currently the main proponent of nassers ideas on arab 
unity did not identify any terror groups that were backed by 
libya one is known to be the fatah revolutionary council a 
dissident palestinian group led by abu nidal whose real name is 
sabry elbanna 
in the past gadhafi insisted he helped only nationalist not 
international movements 
we erroneously thought that these groups could be part of the 
arab national liberation movement he said but we found out 
that they were practicing terrorism for the sake of terrorism and 
for other objectives that had nothing to do with our national cause 
let me tell you frankly that hijacking planes and killing 
civilians are acts of murder that have nothing to do with combat 
gadhafi said libya should not be called to account for any of 
these acts because we have withdrawn our support of such groups 
gadhafis sponsorship of international terror was the principal 
cause of his rift with the united states in september 1987 us 
officials presented to the united nations a selected chronology 
specifying 60 cases of what they termed libyas terrorism and 
support for various terrorist groups 
us warplanes raided two libyan cities the capital of tripoli 
and the mediterranean port of benghazi in april 1986 10 days after 
libya was blamed for masterminding the bombing of a discotheque in 
west berlin frequented by us servicemen 
an american soldier and a woman died in the bombing and 200 
people were wounded 
in the interview gadhafi seemed to be telling the americans he 
wants bygones to be bygones and is eager to turn a new leaf 
he said he would welcome a dialogue with the americans 
anywhere they want on condition it is held in the public eye 
i say very clearly we do not believe that conflict with the 
united states is necessary we believe that many of the problems 
between us can be solved at the negotiating table 
he blamed former president reagans muscleflexing for 
complications in americanlibyan relations and said he felt that 
president bushs administration will be more rational 
in the eightpage interview gadhafi also made these points 
libya has enough arms to meet its needs and is not seeking 
more from the soviet union its principal armorer 
libya would not object to a proposed peace dialogue between 
the palestinians and israel 
egypt and libya should pursue their reconciliation and forge 
closer relations he said it would be silly and idiotic to 
quarrel and trade insults again 
in naples italy police on wednesday blocked 800 libyans who 
arrived by boat to mark a day of mourning declared by gadhafi 
for libyans deported during italian colonial rule police said the 
passengers lacked entry visas 
the libyans as well as several hundred others who have arrived 
over the past few days were planning to take part in 
demonstrations scheduled in rome and other cities on thursday 
the demonstrations are in memory of libyans deported to italy 
during colonial rule between 1911 and the end of world war ii 
libya contends at least 4000 libyans were sent to italy 
libya says oct 26 is the 78th anniversary of the first 
deportations to remote italian islands 
gadhafi wants italy to pay reparations for its colonial 
occupation rome insists it met its obligations by paying 67 
million in 1956 under an agreement with the libyan monarchy later 
deposed by gadhafi in a 1969 coup

firefighter gerry shannon who rescued a 
woman 12 years ago only to have her die grabbed the woman pinned 
in her blazing marina apartment and held on like man in a grudge 
match with death 
the 19year veteran firefighter found sherra cox lying in the 
dust and blackness trapped under a door and doorframe when two 
upper floors of her apartment building collapsed during the oct 17 
earthquake 
when somebody holds your hand and youre a few feet away i 
doubt ill ever feel that again i felt like i knew her and i 
couldnt go no matter what was happening said shannon 44 
when he heard someone was trapped he found an opening in the 
rubble of a sidewall throwing off his coat and helmet he crawled 
inside the dark twofoot hole lighting his way with a flashlight 
cox 55 had dislodged an iron pole and was banging it with her 
one free arm 
i am here she called to shannon who crawled toward the 
voice 
outside firefighters and spectators who smelled the gas 
enveloping the building and saw flames igniting yelled for sannnon 
to leave 
it got real bright and hot when the building across the street 
fell i saw her eyes got wide i heard someone stick his head in 
and yell to get out she just squeezed hard and said please dont 
leave me he said 
the struggle brought back memories of 12 years ago when shannon 
was offduty and pulled a woman from an apartment fire but she 
died shortly after of smoke inhalation 
what ive thought the most about is when i heard everybody 
tell me to get out i knew the building was on fire and it 
felt like we were both done for but i couldnt leave her he said 
but shannon needed equipment or both could die 
he crawled outside and capt robert boudoures handed him a 
chainsaw shannon went back and began to cut the timbers after 
more than an hour shannon cut cox free 
another rescue worker shoved in a stretcher and helped pull cox 
out 
cox was taken to san francisco general hospital where she 
underwent seven hours of surgery for a dislocated fractured hip 
and cracked pelvis she was in fair to good condition wednesday 
i saw her yesterday in the hospital shes doing great shes 
a real tough gal said shannon

earthquakes on one side of san francisco bay 
have been matched within three years by similarsized quakes on the 
other side raising the possibility that another might now be due 
in oakland researchers say 
an earthquake that hit oaklands side of the bay in 1836 was 
followed by a quake on the san francisco side in 1838 and an 
earthquake that hit the san francisco peninsula in 1865 was 
followed by an oakland quake three years later all the earthquakes 
had magnitudes of 63 to 70 
the 1865 earthquake occurred near the loma prieta area of the 
san francisco peninsula where the oct 17 earthquake occurred 
according to a report to appear friday in science magazine 
an oakland quake similar in size on the richter scale to the 
oct 17 earthquake would cause far more damage said allan lindh of 
the us geological survey in menlo park calif as horrible as 
this one is its just nothing compared to when we get an 
earthquake this size in the urban areas in and near oakland he 
told science 
lindh could not be reached wednesday 
lindh william ellsworth and their colleagues in menlo park 
report that the 70 years leading up to the big san francisco 
earthquake of 1906 were marked by numerous earthquakes and that 
activity was sharply reduced after the big quake 
in a telephone interview lynn sykes a seismologist at the 
lamontdoherty geological observatory of columbia university in 
palisades ny said there are reasons to believe the two sides of 
the bay are seismologically linked 
just as there was activity in the oakland area before the 1906 
earthquake there was activity there before the oct 17 quake 
sykes said 
there were a number of magnitude 5 to magnitude 6 earthquakes 
in the east bay starting around 1973 he said i would say in 
both instances the stress or pressures in the earth were building 
up he said 
the question now is did the oct 17 quake relieve pressures 
that had been building in the east bay or did it increase 
pressures there making a matching quake likely 
its too soon toth graf the deaths adds 3

palestinians killed three fellow arabs in the 
occupied territories on wednesday including a woman accused of 
subverting the palestinian revolt by dealing in prostitution 
as police found the body of one victim in an abandoned car 
masked youths appeared on a nearby hill and shouted allahu 
akbar arabic for god is great 
in tel aviv judges sentenced a west bank palestinian to life in 
prison plus 20 years after he pleaded guilty to murdering an 
israeli construction worker and trying to careen a crowded public 
bus into a steep ravine last month 
also wednesday foreign minister moshe arens said us middle 
east peace proposals must be changed to more closely reflect 
israels own initiative before they can be accepted by the 
government 
arens wants the united states to exclude cairo as the site for a 
preliminary israelpalestinian meeting and to change language 
suggesting palestinians from outside the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip may take part an israeli official said 
in the gaza strip police found the body of an accused 
collaborator fayez mohammed sahlawi 29 in the trunk of a car 
parked north of his home village of beit hanoun they said an 
initial investigation indicated he was shot to death masked youths

the residents said alwafa was accused of working with the 
israeli intelligence agents and dealing in drugs 
the army spokesmans office confirmed the deaths of both ms

the deaths raised to 135 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs as suspected collaborators or as drug dealers or 
prostitutes during the 22month palestinian uprising against

in tel aviv a district court sentenced 26yearold ahmed 
shukry of ramallah to life plus 20 years after he pleaded guilty 
wednesday to one count of murder and 51 counts of attempted murder 
shukrys second sentence would start should he be granted 
parole which is possible after 20 years under a life sentence in 
israel meaning he faced at least 40 years in prison 
shukry was convicted of murdering michael eshtener 38 at a tel 
aviv building site sept 7 and of stabbing an israeli bus driver 
two days later in an attempt to force a bus off the jerusalemtel 
aviv highway into a ravine 
shukrys attempt occurred near the spot where a palestinian

jews including a us tourist and two canadians 
in the occupied territories arab children are being killed 
every day army radio quoted shukry as telling the court i 
wanted to kill jewish children 
at least 603 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians in the uprising according to the israeli information 
center for human rights more than 120 of those killed were under 
age 16 forty israelis have also died in the violence 
the foreign minister interviewed by governmentrun radio 
disputed a report by the israeli embassy in washington that he 
already had agreed in principle to a fivepoint peace plan of us 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
we are working in order to ensure that the formula presented 
by the secretary of state will be the same as the governments 
decision the governments initiative arens told the radio from 
brussels where he is attending a meeting 
the israeli peace initiative calls for elections in the occupied 
lands to select palestinians to open talks with israel on limited 
autonomy it rules out any role for the plo which israel considers 
a terrorist organization 
israeli officials have opposed cairo as a venue for preliminary 
talks because they believe egypt is trying to act as an 
intermediary for the plo 
in washington baker said the suggested changes will be reviewed 
but cautioned if we start making changes for one side we will 
find ourselves in an extended negotiating session in terms of 
making changes that might be requested 
it would be much better if both sides would accept the five 
points as a general framework for moving forward he said 
a foreign ministry official said he could not comment until he

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on 
wednesday defended his agencys political independence and warned 
that proposals to make the central bank more accountable to 
congress and the administration could hamper its fight against 
inflation 
greenspan was the leadoff witnesses as congress launched its 
first major review in more than a decade of the operations of the 
federal reserve and its chairman often called the second most 
powerful man in the country because of the feds power over 
interest rates 
greenspan said he opposed a bill sponsored by reps lee 
hamilton dind and byron dorgan dnd that they say would 
make the central banks deliberations less secretive and more 
accountable to the public 
the hamiltondorgan bill would require the feds top 
policymaking body the federal open market committee to meet with 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and other bush administration 
officials at regular intervals 
the bill would also require immediate release of decisions made 
by the fomc and it would change the term of the fed chairman so 
that an incoming president would be able to appoint a new chairman 
sooner after taking office 
greenspan rejected all of these proposals contending they 
increased the risks that the fed would set interest rates in 
response to political pressures rather than on judgments about what 
was best for the longrun health of the economy 
the federal reserve must take actions that while sometimes 
unpopular in the shortrun are in the longrun best interests of 
the country greenspan said adding the feds 75year history of 
independence had served the country well 
while voicing strong opposition to the hamiltondorgan bill 
greenspan did endorse a separate resolution sponsored by rep 
stephen neal dnc that would write into law a requirement that 
the fed eliminate inflation and give the central bank five years to 
reach that goal 
terming neals measure a laudable effort to clarify the 
feds mandate greenspan warned that wringing inflation out of the 
economy over the next five years would have shortterm costs in 
terms of slower growth he termed the 1994 deadline achievable and 
said it could be accomplished without plunging the country into a 
recession 
consumer prices after spurting up sharply early in the year 
are now rising at an annual rate of 44 percent very close to the 
rate of inflation over the past several years 
neals measure does not include any penalties if the fed fails 
to meet the fiveyear deadline for eliminating inflation but neal 
argued that the resolution would clarify existing law which 
directs the fed to pursue the sometimes conflicting goals of 
promoting employment stable prices and moderate longterm interest 
rates 
in his appearance before congress greenspan sought to play down 
reports of a major rift between the fed and the bush administration 
over interest rates the administration has been pushing the fed to 
lower rates in an effort to spur economic growth and lower the 
international exchange rate of the dollar 
greenspan said that he and the administration have differences 
on occasions but that what was being interpreted as major 
disputes were in reality only disagreements concerning relatively 
minor issues of tactics 
both the neal measure and the hamiltondorgan proposal are given 
slight chance of getting through congress because of opposition in 
the senate where key members of the senate banking committee have 
given the fed high marks and said they see no reason to make 
changes

the house on wednesday voted 258162 to 
protect thousands of illegal aliens who fled conflict in their 
homelands by deferring their deportation to china el salvador and 
nicaragua 
it will create humanitarian relief for three categories of 
individuals who are here in the united states and for whom there is 
no will to send them back said rep bruce morrison dconn 
the bill which now goes to the senate would suspend for three 
years deportation of chinese salvadorans and nicaraguans who 
register within nine months 
it would stop short of granting political asylum or permanent 
resident status but would provide temporary protection to perhaps 
750000 exiles 
it also would establish a system for extending such temporary 
status to citizens of additional countries beset by armed conflict 
and natural disaster 
the measure is designed to furnish shelter to those who have 
fled civil war in central america and face government persecution 
as a result of the student democracy demonstrations in china 
proponents said 70000 salvadorans and 30000 nicaraguan 
civilians have been killed in civil wars in their countries over 
the last decade and that 10000 participants in the chinese 
democracy demonstrations have been jailed 
they scoffed at complaints that the measure would create an 
exception that would undermine existing immigration law 
critics said it was a mistake to combine relief measures for the 
central americans and the chinese they said the measure would 
merely provide central americans hungry for american jobs with a 
foot in the door 
what we are going to do is grant a permanent status not to 
people who came here for any political reason but for people who 
came here for an economic reason to take jobs away from american 
workers said rep bob walker rpa 
rep joe moakley dmass a supporter of the measure retorted 
that the aflcio and a number of large labor unions have endorsed 
the measure so evidently they arent afraid he told the house 
rep helen bentley rmd cited estimates that the price tag on 
operation of the measure could reach 260 million over two years 
i can tell you that my constituents will not abide by it she 
declared 
rep hamilton fish rny said that illegal aliens who have 
fled the three countries already are in the united states i 
think its in our interest to have nicaraguans and salvadorans 
living in the open rather than maintaining an underground 
existence he said 
this bill is the right thing to do rep bill richardson 
dnm told the house he urged help for those uprooted for 
political reasons who have been escaping tragedy

the foreign minister said wednesday 
that khmer rouge guerrillas seized the strategic cambodian town of 
pailin a victory that could block the movement of government 
troops and supplies to nearby cities 
the khmer rouge said in a radio broadcast the seizure opened the 
door for an assault on the city of battambang and it advised 
government soldiers to leave the area in order to stay alive 
the guerrillas said they took pailin along the thai border on 
sunday after a twoyear offensive 
foreign minister siddhi savetsila of thailand confirmed the 
report and said the guerrillas also captured artillery guns tanks 
and ammunition stockpiles he was the first thai official to 
confirm the guerrilla takeover 
it could be a major victory for the khmer rouge in its war to 
oust the government vietnam installed after its 1978 invasion 
government soldiers had vowed to hold onto pailin which is 
along route 10 leading to the provincial capital of battambang 40 
miles away battambang is cambodias largest city after the 
capital phnom penh 
a khmer rouge army broadcast said guerrillas routed the 196th 
division two brigades and three provincial regiments in their 
twoday final offensive on pailin 
pailin town has a very important strategic role for the 
vietnamese enemy and puppets militarily politically and 
economically it said particularly in the military aspect it 
is a strategic door directly relating to the survival of battambang 
town 
the broadcast said provietnamese forces face serious problems 
trying to move soldiers and supplies to defend route 10 and 
battambang 
parents and compatriots it said please call on your 
children and husbands to quickly desert for home in order to 
stay alive 
what is the use of the remaining district and provincial units 
fighting and dying 
the broadcast said some vietnamese disguised as cambodian 
soldiers helped the cambodian troops defend pailin 
vietnam said it pulled the last of its soldiers from cambodia 
last month but the guerrillas say thousands are still in the 
country 
the vietnamese withdrawal raised fears the cambodian army would 
not be able to hold its own against the khmer rouge and the two 
noncommunist guerrilla groups the khmer peoples national 
liberation front and the army of prince norodom sihanouk the khmer 
rouge is the strongest of the coalition 
thai military sources said the khmer rouge killed 120 government 
soldiers and captured 17 at pailin 
siddhi who spoke at a weekly news briefing said neither the 
phnom penh government nor the guerrillas is strong enough to win a 
clear victory in the war in the end they will have to compromise 
and come back to negotiations he said 
thailand is leading efforts to revive peace negotiations 
stalled since the failure of an international conference in paris 
in august 
the main stumbling block was the cambodian governments refusal 
to agree to a government role for the khmer rouge which massacred 
hundreds of thousands of cambodians in the 1970s before it was 
ousted

the ruling party on wednesday opened 
its first plenum since the soviet troop withdrawal and promoted to 
the central committee several leading figures who opposed moscows 
intervention in the afghan war 
several rockets slammed into kabul killing six people 
four members of one family were killed when a missile crashed 
through their house and exploded women stood in the courtyard of 
the house wailing in mourning 
another rocket landed in the hills behind kabul 
the plenum was held amid tight security in deteriorating 
government buildings in downtown kabul it elected 19 new full 
members and one alternate to the policymaking central committee of 
the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan a government 
spokesman said two new members were also appointed to the 
politburo the highest policymaking body in the country 
a tank manned by several soldiers stood at one end of the street 
near the meeting place dozens of troops patrolled the streets 
nearby 
the party changes were intended to unite the party and increase 
support from the military diplomats and an afghan government 
source said 
president najib addressed the meeting and said the party was 
ready to unite with all progressive groups to achieve peace in 
afghanistan it was the first full party meeting since october 1988 
the sovietbacked government is in the middle of a civil war 
against usbacked moslem guerrillas although fighting appears 
stalemated the rebels control much of the countryside 
among the new central committee members are karim misaq and 
abdul ghorbandi both leading members of the ruling partys khalq 
faction which opposed the soviet military intervention in 1979 
the intervention brought khalqs opponent the parcham faction 
to power 
the two factions have been bitter enemies since the 1960s 
traditionally khalq which means masses had much support in 
the military and parcham meaning flag was popular among 
intellectuals neither can claim much popular support 
the khalq group has long been critical of moscows military 
presence in afghanistan and blames afghanistans current plight on 
the policies of the parcham 
since the last soviet troops withdrew in february the partys 
parcham leadership especially najib has sought to blunt such 
criticism by bringing khalq members into government 
these moves are necessary to show the rebels that our ranks 
are united said a government official speaking on condition of 
anonymity we are showing that we have a strong party 
the official said the parcham group was also bringing khalq 
people into the central commtttee because they need military 
support the khalq group has strong military backing it was the 
military that put the khalq faction in power in april 1978 when 
officers loyal khalq staged a communist coup 
soviet forces intervened in december 1979 to replace that 
government with another then stayed to help fight the guerrillas 
also appointed to the central committee were the secretaries of 
several provincial party committees 
afghan guerrillas said they have scored more victories against 
government forces in the past two weeks than at any time since the 
soviet troops left 
najibullah lefrey information minister in the rebels 
governmentinexile made the claim in a news conference in 
islamabad pakistan the guerrillas are based in pakistan 
this month the guerrillas stopped a major army convoy that was 
heading south from kabul to supply troops defending khost an 
eastern garrison town 90 miles away that has been under siege since 
august 
lefrey said the air force then tried to drop supplies to khost 
by parachute but that many landed in guerrillacontrolled areas 
nearby

a deaf teenage girl who walked into a 
school nervously seeking help was apparently kidnapped several 
years ago and moved around the country possibly by satanists an 
fbi agent said wednesday 
from some of the drawings she was able to provide it is 
believed that some of the people she was with since her abduction 
may have been tied to the occult fbi agent paul cavanagh said 
authorities have had a hard time gathering information from the 
frightened confused girl but she has given them drawings that 
include symbols associated with satanism and indicated she may have 
been abducted from a foster home in california cavanagh said 
the girl showed up sept 18 at william b jack elementary school 
in portland identifying herself in sign language as toby cole 
she just stopped at the counter she walked in and signed a 
little bit said judi fox a teachers aide who called in a 
teacher who speaks in sign language the teacher realized the girl 
needed help and took her to the governor baxter school for the deaf 
in nearby falmouth where authorities began questioning her 
over the next few weeks toby provided information which leads 
us to believe that she is possibly the victim of a kidnapping 
abduction the fbi said in a statement issued by its boston 
office 
toby has indicated that she is not sure toby cole is her real 
name but is the name given to her by her abductors the 
statement said she stated she believes she is 15 years of age 
and possibly was born on dec 25 1974 toby seems to possess a 
good vocabulary and is far ahead of children in her age bracket in 
intelligence and communication skills 
cavanagh said wednesday from boston that psychologists and 
childcare experts dealing with the girl have pieced together 
enough information to believe she was abducted from california 
about three years ago then moved several times possibly into 
canada 
she claims to have been abducted by a male out there who was 
driving a van at the time cavanagh said he said authorities had 
no reason to doubt the girls story but had found no missing 
person reports matching her 
we did receive a communication on it supervisory special 
agent susan schnitzer in san francisco said wednesday anything 
were requested by the boston division to do well be doing 
ms schnitzer declined further comment 
falmouth police lt michael bouchard said wednesday that his 
department had received numerous calls but had no immediate leads 
on the girls family or any suspects in her abduction 
authorities said the girl was in the care of the maine 
department of human services shes in a safe place in the 
state bouchard said shes comfortable shes being taken care 
of 
cavanagh said authorities believed the girl had been abused but 
he did not think she had been emotionally able to undergo physical 
tests that would determine whether she had been sexually abused 
the elementary teacher who was able to sign with the girl said 
wednesday she took her to the baxter school because the girl 
quickly indicated she needed help 
i realized she was a deaf person in a hearing environment and 
she would do better in a deaf environment ann marie 
papistratton said 
ms papistratton declined to say what the girl told her 
at the baxter school superintendent kathleen fries said she had 
been advised by authorities and her superiors not to discuss 
specifics of the case 
the principal of jack elementary myrt collins said employees 
who saw the girl described her as frightened and anxious 
although there was nothing unusual about her appearance or dress 
the fbi statement on the girl described her as a caucasian 
about 5 feet tall and 105 pounds with blond or light brown wavy 
hair and blue eyes

a panel of rural appraisers says farmland 
values are expected to continue rising in 1990 but at a much 
slower rate than this year the agriculture department reported 
wednesday 
based on a survey made in early august farmland prices are 
likely to rise an average 35 percent by august 1990 that would 
be about half the 65 percent increase reported for 198889 
one reason suggested by appraisers for the slowdown is a drop 
in corn and soybean prices from the droughtlevels of last year 
but higher wheat prices probably are helping support some values 
particularly in the great plains 
a group of about 500 appraisers is checked quarterly by a 
university of wisconsin survey laboratory for the departments 
economic research service said analyst roger hexem author of the 
report 
hexem said in a telephone interview that the yearahead estimate 
by appraisers was somewhat lower than we have been forecasting 
within the agency the information is being reviewed and will be 
considered when usda issues its next farmland forecast late in 
november 
the report said appraisers expect land values to rise the 
fastest in the north central region up 48 percent during the 
198990 compared with a 95 percent increase reported in 198889 
no state estimates were included in the report 
while corn and soybean prices remain relatively high compared 
with recent years current prices are lower than last year and may 
have contributed to the lessoptimistic outlook the report said 
in contrast high and rising wheat prices are llikely providing 
strength to the regions land values 
in the south appraisers expect land values to increase an 
average of 27 percent in 198990 compared with 55 percent the 
previous 12 months 
principal factors behind the 27 percent increase expected in 
the south are commodity price movements lower interest rates and 
improving farm incomes the report said during the past year 
the appraisers said high commodity prices government programs and 
favorable weather contributed to higher farmland values in the 
south 
farmland in the west was forecast by appraisers to appreciate 
about 3 percvent compared with 41 percent in 198889 
high commodity prices including cattle and stronger demand 
by nonagricultural investors are the most frequently cited factors 
behind the increases the report said 
values in the northeast are expected to rise an average of 14 
percent in 198990 compared with 28 percent the previous year

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said wednesday his country is determined to maintain 
friendly relations with polands communists and with the 
noncommunists leading the government 
i think it is an interesting period and obviously this 
situation deserves introducing some corrections the chief soviet 
diplomat said when asked about the current state of sovietpolish 
relations 
first of all we have to rebuild the mechanisms of economic 
relations and increase the effectiveness of our cooperation he 
said without elaborating 
a joint communique said both sides agreed mutual problems should 
be solved on the basis of the principles of freedom of choice and 
nonintervention in internal affairs 
shevardnadze is the highestranking soviet official to visit 
poland since the election to prime minister aug 24 of tadeusz 
mazowiecki the east blocs first noncommunist prime minister 
after meeting with him tuesday shevardnadze announced mazowiecki 
will visit moscow next month 
shevardnadze demonstrated moscows apparent openness to polish 
pluralism wednesday when he invited adam michnik a top solidarity 
editor and former political prisoner to join him for part of a 
session with communist party leader mieczyslaw f rakowski 
afterward shevardnadze declared he is willing to meet with 
every party with anybody 
michnik editor in chief of the prosolidarity gazeta wyborcza 
daily and one of polands keenest observers of soviet affairs was 
the only journalist ushered into the central committee conference 
room they talked for about 10 minutes before shevardnadze came out 
and spoke with other reporters 
the soviet government has said it views the radical changes in 
poland as internal political matters shevardnadze said the soviet 
union is determined to maintain friendly relations with the new 
solidarityled coalition government as well as with polands 
communist party 
speaking of blanks spots in polishsoviet history such as 
the massacre of polish soldiers on soviet soil during world war ii 
shevardnadze said they would be cleared up 
we want only the truth it is needed by our two nations and is 
in the interest of friendship he said 
the joint communique said both sides had confirmed the will to 
explain some problems and history of polishsoviet relations 
quickening of these works is in the interest of both sides 
the most important is the massacre of nearly 4500 polish 
officers at the katyn forest in world war ii a polish commission 
has traced responsibility to soviet secret police but there has 
been no response from the soviets 
asked what the limits to soviet tolerance of changes in poland 
are shevardnadze said we dont set up order in other countries 
would you want it to be so 
the meeting with rakowski was followed by a meeting with 
president wojciech jaruzelski a communist they embraced warmly 
and posed for photographers before beginning private discussions 
during talks with new foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski on 
tuesday shevardnadze pledged that the soviet union will maintain 
crucial deliveries of oil and raw materials to poland its largest 
economic partner in the east bloc 
moscow provides nearly 85 percent of polands crude oil 65 
percent of its processed petroleum products and 72 percent of its 
iron ore 
shevardnadze told the official pap news agency his country is 
interested in an intensification of economic relations with poland 
cooperation is simply necessary because the soviet and polish 
economies are complimentary to each other in many spheres he 
said 
shevardnadze said trade with poland represents about 10 percent 
of his countrys total foreign trade while the soviet union 
receives about onethird of polish trade 
both countries are in the midst of economic crisis but the new 
polish government has made a firm commitment to introduce a market 
economy and is seeking to renegotiate its contacts with its east 
bloc trading partners

south korea plans to purchase 120 us jet 
fighters under a coproduction agreement that one senator predicts 
will spark a bitter brawl between congress and the 
administration officials said wednesday 
south korean defense minister lee sang hoon has informed defense 
secretary dick cheney that the seoul government will announce its 
choice between two us fighters early next month said pentagon 
sources 
cheney was told of the decision during a courtesy call at the 
pentagon last week said the sources who spoke on condition of not 
being identified by name 
lee was in washington during the visit of south korean president 
roh tae woo 
the south koreans will choose between the fa18 hornet built 
by the mcdonnell douglas corp or the f16 falcon built by general 
dynamics corp in order to modernize their fleet of aging f5 
fighters 
sen alan dixon dill an opponent of the coproduction plan 
said through an aide on wednesday that the deal could be worth 18 
billion to 3 billion 
the aide said dixon foresees a bitter bitter brawl between 
congress and the bush administration over the plan and contends it 
will cost us jobs and harm american aerospace and aviation 
industries 
the senator plans to offer a resolution in the senate to express 
disapproval of the deal as soon as it is official said the 
aide who asked not to be identified by name 
the koreans proposed to buy 12 fighters offtheshelf from us 
manufacturers assemble 36 from ussupplied kits and then build 
72 on their own an arrangement that has been accepted by us 
negotiators 
pentagon spokesman navy lt cmdr edward lundquist confirmed 
that us and korean negotiators have agreed to a 123672 mix 
lundquist said 12 aircraft will be fully built in the united 
states 36 will be assembled in south korea from imported parts and 
72 planes will be built in south korea under the licensed 
coproduction agreement 
a significant portion of the coproduced aircraft will be 
produced in the united states at least 70 percent of the 
programs value will be spent in the united states he said 
during a visit to the pentagon in july lee said the decision on 
the purchase of the 120 fighters was to be announced in september 
cheney said after that july session that he preferred the 
koreans purchase the planes readymade by us manufacturers but 
added that the final agreement would probably be some blend of 
outright purchase and coproduction 
the defense secretary added that he was pleased the koreans had 
decided to purchase us planes over those of other nations

egypts top security official denied 
lawyers assertions wednesday that us rather than egyptian 
investigators uncovered a terror group charged with attacking 
american and israeli diplomats 
the defense lawyers goal appeared to be to embarrass interior 
minister zaki badr and the government 
badrs rare appearance on a state security court subpoena was to 
elicit testimony on the investigation of 20 alleged members of an 
organization calling itself egypts revolution 
the defendants are charged with murder attempted murder and 
criminal complicity in four shootings between 1984 and 1987 that 
killed two israeli diplomats and wounded six israelis and two us 
diplomats 
all 20 defendants were present except khaled abdel nasser 
eldest son of the late president gamal abdel nasser he is 
reportedly living in yugoslavia 
badrs ministry handles egypts internal security 
during his 70minute testimony badr denied repeatedly that 
defendant essam nour eldin went to the us embassy in cairo in 
1987 to confess and was questioned there for more than two weeks 
before being surrendered to egyptian authorities 
defense attorneys contended that before the americans gave them 
nour eldin badrs investigators had no clue to the terrorist 
group whose attacks had greatly embarrassed the government 
essam nour eldin told state security authorities that he had 
information about these cases in the middle of august 1987 badr 
told the court authorities checked his story and made their 
investigations 
defense lawyer adel amin alleged that president hosni mubarak 
formed a committee which included badr to investigate egypts 
revolution on the basis of information from the us embassy 
centering on nour eldins statements 
i am sure that no decision was ever made to create such a 
committee therefore i could not possibly have been a member of 
it badr said 
after badr left nour eldin testified that he went to the us 
embassy and made statements to officials there 
embassy spokeswoman marcelle wahba refused comment on the two 
mens testimony 
amin cited purportedly official papers to show that nour eldin 
went to the embassy aug 15 1987 and that security authorities 
were informed of the case sept 6 nevertheless amin said 
defendant khaled abdel nasser was able to leave egypt on sept 10 
when someone makes an accusation just an accusation should i 
prevent people from traveling abroad without my having proof and 
without going through the judicial authorities badr responded 
the prosecution has demanded the death penalty for 11 
defendants including nasser who was charged with murder 
attempted murder undermining egypts national security and 
damaging its relations with israel and the united states 
the remaining nine among them a nephew of president nasser are 
charged with complicity and could be sentenced to prison terms of 
up to 25 years 
eleven defendants are in custody the rest are free on bail

the bush administration complained to moscow 
on wednesday that nicaragua is still shipping sovietbloc arms to 
salvadoran rebels despite repeated soviet and nicaraguan denials 
secretary of state james a baker iii citing the seizure of a 
truckload of weapons on the nicaraguanhondran border called the 
continued shipments a major problem 
weve had an extended dialogue with the soviet union about the 
importance of using their influence to stop that kind of 
activity baker said 
at the same time president bush extended for another six months 
a us trade embargo against nicaragua first imposed by president 
reagan in mid1985 
in a statement announcing the renewal of the sanctions bush 
said the central american nation continues to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to national security and foreign policy of the 
united states 
bush must report to congress twice a year on the status of the 
embargo and on usnicaraguan relations 
the developments came as bush prepared for a visit to costa 
rica where he and 17 other heads of state including nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega will join in festivities marking 100 
years of costa rican democracy 
baker briefing reporters on bushs trip said the president 
would not meet with ortega during the twoday visit that begins 
friday 
he cited continued clandestine shipments by oretgas sandinista 
government of eastbloc arms to leftist salvadoran rebels as one 
reason why a bushortega meeting would be inappropriate 
nicaragua clearly continues to ship arms to the 
antigovernment rebels baker said 
it is a major problem that we have called to the attention of 
the soviet union and called to their attention as recently as 
today baker said 
asked whether the apparent continued shipments undermine soviet 
credibility baker said it is a major stumbling block 
the soviets have denied any knowledge of the shipments 
the honduran military last wednesday seized what officials 
called a record shipment of weapons being sent from nicaragua 
through hondurus to rebels in el salvador 
the state department says the captured weaponry includes 20 akm 
assault rifles with 13 of soviet manufacture the remainder were 
made in other sovietbloc countries 
the cargo also reportedly included more than 300 rifle grenades 
800 mortar shells large quantities of sovietmade hand grenades 
50 other assault weapons or machine guns large quantities of 
ammunition explosives and military radios according to the state 
department much of the equipment was wrapped in nicaraguan 
newspapers 
also included with the weapons were instruction booklets with 
fmln on the cover the letters of the spanishlanguage name of 
the salvadoran liberation effort 
salvadoran government officials have told the state department 
that the truck was registered in the name of a known fmln front 
group us officials said 
at the very least the government of nicaragua is not doing 
what they are telling the soviet union based on what the soviet 
union tells us baker told reporters 
noting that soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze had 
recently visited nicaragua baker said it would appear to me the 
nicaraguans are telling them one thing and doing something else 
baker said 
the bush administration wants to see ortegas government voted 
out of office in the election next feb 25 and contends that 
election preparations unfairly benefit the ruling sandinistas 
bush in his sixmonth report to congress on the status of the 
nicaragua embargo said the trade sanctions are an essential 
element of our policy that seeks a democratic outcome in nicaragua 
by diplomatic means 
the embargo bars imports from nicaragua and bans us exports to 
that country except to support the contra rebels fighting the 
leftist sandinista government it also prohibits nicaraguan 
aircraft or boats from entering the united states

sales of existing homes responding to lower 
interest rates climbed 43 percent in september to the highest 
level this year a real estate trade group said wednesday 
the national association of realtors said existing singlefamily 
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 363 
million units last month following a 45 percent sales increase in 
august 
analysts credited lower mortgage rates for the backtoback 
monthly increases in sales with the lower rates meaning families 
that had been priced out of the market when rates were rising 
earlier in the year can now afford homes 
at the end of last week fixedrate mortgages had dipped back 
below 10 percent averaging 992 percent according to a weekly 
survey conducted by the federal home loan mortgage corp last 
spring mortgage rates hit a peak of 1122 percent reflecting a 
yearlong effort on the part of the federal reserve to push rates 
higher in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures 
with signs that inflation was easing the fed has relented and 
has been nudging rates lower in response to signs of sluggish 
economic growth 
many people who were forced to put off trading up or entering 
the market earlier this year are making their move now said ira 
gribin president of the realtors association with mortgage 
rates lower during the second half of the year than the first the 
market is reaching a broader income range of buyers 
the national median price for an existing singlefamily home 
fell from august to september by 1400 to 93400 the median or 
midpoint price was still 55 percent higher than it was a year 
ago 
analysts attributed the onemonth price drop in large part to 
the fact that the market in september shifts away from larger 
families to smaller households buying smaller homes 
regionally the sales advance was paced by a 127 percent 
increase in the west where homes were sold at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 620000 units in september 
sales were up 37 percent in the south to an annual rate of 140 
million units while sales rose 1 percent in the midwest to an 
annual rate of 990000 units 
sales were unchanged in the northeast at 590000 units this is 
down 92 percent from a year ago home sales in the northeast have 
been in a slump this year because surging home costs have priced 
many buyers out of the market 
but john tuccillo chief economist for the realtors said that 
sales in the northeast have come back slightly from a lowpoint 
reached in june and appear to be stabilizing at the current sales 
pace 
housing markets appear to be firming up across the board we 
expect that the lower mortgage rates this fall will keep boosting 
sales in the moderateprice range tuccillo said 
the most expensive housing market in september was the 
northeast where a medianpriced home went for 144800 followed 
by the west at 144300 the median sales price in the south was 
84200 while the midwest offered the cheapest housing with a 
median price of 71800 in september 
the national sales pace of 363 million units was the fastest 
clip since homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
392 million units last december

scientists marine enforcement and 
florida businesses are pulling together to save the manatee from 
boaters in a campaign keyed to the mammals endangered status 
miss her now or miss her forever 
i think the slogan has really got a message vi stewart of 
the state department of natural resources marine research 
laboratory said wednesday its very significant but youve got 
to think about it it doesnt jump out and grab you like wheres 
the beef 
marine experts estimate there are probably 1200 west indian 
manatees left in the united states down from as many as an 
estimated 10000 a few decades ago almost all are in floridas 
coastal waters 
so far this year through september 125 have died in florida 41 
after being struck by boats or barges last year 113 deaths were 
recorded 
aiming to slow this recordsetting pace a multimedia 
advertising blitz is planned for the time of year when the gentle 
giant is most vulnerable to boaters 
as the temperature drops and the water cools the lumbering sea 
cows move into warmer waters near springs or thermal discharges of 
power plants thus increasing the risk of contact with boaters 
the next six months is the most critical time for the 
manatee said ralph campbell president of hla advertising and 
public relations of tampa which donated work on the campaign and 
came up with the slogan 
the state cabinet is recommending posting speed limits for boats 
and the licensing of operators in a twofold effort to reduce 
boatrelated deaths and to protect manatees 
florida has 711000 registered boats the state had 105 
boatingrelated deaths last year 
gov bob martinez and the cabinet also voted tuesday to require 
13 counties where the manatees are concentrated to decide within 60 
days whether to immpose countywide speed limits or adopt more 
specific plans

a few feet away scruffylooking street people walked between 
temporary metal barricades to breakfast one man washed his hair 
using canned water there was no contact between the mismatched 
schoolmates 
red cross officials estimated about half the homeless were 
displaced residents of the affluent area while the other half 
permanently lived on the streets 
some of the freshfaced students were upset that the homeless 
were still in the building more than a week after the oct 17 
quake even though security is heavy and segregation nearly total 
it might be disturbing the students said student kevin wong 
as he headed into classes 
a student who wouldnt give his name said some children feel 
they have sacrificed enough by giving up a week of classes so the 
victims could be housed 
with the cafeteria turned over to the homeless students have to 
bring bag lunches wednesday morning the cafeteria featured an 
obscenityfilled screaming match between two street people who had 
to be separated by security guards outside in the yard lay a 
bundle of filthy clothes

would not allow to give her name we cant get to the gym 
but administrators said they were happy to help

in these little seats ms doss said as she ate a breakfast of a 
banana orange slices and a turnover 
this is better food than ive been eating said rick

the house banking committee will hold hearings 
in texas to examine why the southwest is reportedly awash with 
drug monies being laundered through banks in the region chairman 
henry b gonzalez announced wednesday 
gonzalez a texas democrat said the hearings would be conducted 
in his hometown of san antonio dec 6 and 7 to examine the growing 
problem of money laundering in the southwest and whether current 
banking laws are adequate 
recent reports show that more cash is flowing into certain 
southwest financial institutions than is being withdrawn 
gonzalez said in a statement such an influx of cash 
particularly in small bills is often an indication that the 
deposit is the result of an illegal drug sale 
gonzalez cited a story in the austin americanstatesman that 
said the cash surplus in the san antonio vault of the federal 
reserve rose from 900 million in 1986 to 16 billion in 1988 
only the federal reserve banks in miami los angeles and 
jacksonville fla have larger cash surpluses gonzalez said 
gonzalez said his committee would ask officials on the front 
lines in the war against drugs to discuss the extent of the drug 
problem and money laundering in the southwest and how local and 
state law enforcement agencies are cordinating their efforts with 
federal agencies 
witnesses would also be called from the border patrol drug 
enforcement administration customs service and internal revenue 
service gonzalez said as the committee attempts to assess the 
federal governments effectiveness in combatting money laundering 
activities 
the role of financial institutions would also be examined 
when congress passed the omnibus drug initiative act of 1988 
the banking committee made sure that the bill contained strong 
language designed to prevent our nations banks from being used as 
laudromats to launder the illgotten gains of drug dealers 
gonzalez said 
gonzalez said the hearings would look at the role of 
international bankers in combatting money laundering and would 
examine international money trasnfer systems and attempt to 
estimate the volume of illegal drug funds worldwide

former labor secretary wj usery jr on 
wednesday stepped into the fray between the pittston co and 1700 
striking miners as the governments super mediator saying he hopes 
to provide different ideas different everything to bring an 
end to the 7monthold walkout 
usery tapped by current labor secretary elizabeth dole to 
intervene in the threestate strike admitted initial reluctance to 
do so because of the acrimony between the two sides which havent 
bargained directly with one another since the walkout began in 
april 
this is one that you didnt jump at so quick said usery a 
veteran mediator who served as labor secretary in the final year of 
the ford administration 
still he said he would get to work immediately and hoped a 
settlement could be reached by the holidays he did not say whether 
he meant thanksgiving or christmas 
mrs dole said the decision to appoint a super mediator was 
not a sign of disappointment with the federal mediators currently 
involved in the negotiations but she said her recent visit with 
pittston strikers and her threeway meeting with company chairman 
paul douglas and united mine workers president richard trumka had 
convinced her of the need to name a mediator of greater stature 
i believe that bill usery is precisely the right person she 
told reporters 
added usery there comes a time that the parties themselves 
the process needs an additional thrust needs someone else needs 
a different voice different suggestions different ideas 
different everything i hope that im the person who can bring this 
to a stop 
a spokeswoman for pittston coal group susan copeland said 
that although we have not worked with mr usery in the past his 
integrity and reputation for fairness are very well known and we 
look forward to working closely with him 
she said the company resisted the unions efforts to get usery 
involved earlier this year because we felt at that time that all 
other bargaining possibilities had not been exhausted 
trumka in a statement said usery is familiar with the 
industry has an intimate knowledge of the significance of the 
issues involved and possesses a reputation for fairness and 
impartiality a better choice for mediator could not have been 
made trumka urged daily facetoface bargaining sessions 
usery said he had been in touch with pittson which had objected 
to a union request several months ago that usery be asked to 
mediate the dispute 
they called and assured me that they would give me their full 
cooperation and were hopeful that a resolution would be found he 
said 
usery said he would begin private separate discussions 
wednesday with the principals in the dispute and hoped to arrange a 
facetoface meeting soon 
well be working at it quite rapidly he said adding that 
marathon bargaining sessions were possible once he was up to speed 
on the issues health benefits particularly those paid to 
pensioners have been the major issue dividing the company and its 
miners in virginia west virginia and kentucky 
since leaving government usery has headed a washington labor 
relations firm that bears his name among the dozens of major 
strike he has mediated were a sixmonth strike by the united auto 
workers against deere amp co in 1987 and a threeweek strike by 
chicago teachers in 1983 
the hardwick ga native was appointed assistant secretary of 
labor in 1969 and headed the federal mediation and conciliation 
service from 1973 until ford tapped him for the cabinet post in 
1976

nato defense ministers urged the 
soviets on wednesday to reduce their shortrange nuclear arsenal 
and cautioned the west against dropping its guard because of the 
democratic trend in eastern europe 
defense secretary dick cheney of the united states and the other 
defense chiefs welcomed moscows offer of unilateral cuts in 
conventional forces but said those would have little effect on the 
warsaw pacts nuclear capabilities 
in a statement ending a twoday semiannual meeting of the 
western alliances nuclear planning group the ministers called 
again on the soviet union to reduce unilaterally its shortrange 
missile systems to current nato levels 
they said the soviets maintained a massive superiority in 
shortrange nuclear weapons by updating their systems 
cheney told reporters afterward the soviet union still 
possesses enormous military capability their strategic capability 
is more robust today than it was when gorbachev came to power 
president mikhail s gorbachev became communist party chief in 
march 1985 
the nato ministers said the alliances nuclear warheads in 
western europe had been reduced by more than onethird since 1979 
to the lowest level in more than 20 years 
according to western estimates the soviet union has 1450 
shortrange missile launchers in europe nato has 88 lance 
launchers most of them in west germany 
gorbachev has promised to withdraw 500 shortrange nuclear 
weapons from europe this year 
two days after foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze admitted 
the disputed krasnoyarsk radar in siberia violates the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty the ministers welcomed the soviet 
offer to dismantle it 
their statement stressed the importance of full compliance 
with arms control agreements and said nato looked forward to 
the prompt and full implementation of this commitment on 
krasnoyarsk 
about democratic reforms spreading through eastern europe 
cheney said there is great uncertainty about how events will 
unfold in the soviet union and cautioned against a euphoric 
attitude 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater was asked in washington 
about shevardnadzes proposal this week during a speech to soviet 
legislators of negotiations on disbanding nato and the warsaw pact 
fitzwater replied 
we dont have a position on their idea we think nato is 
important we expect the nato pact to be in existence for some 
time otherwise we dont have any comment 
defense minister tom king of britain said the 16member nato 
alliance was even more important now at this time of manifest 
change in the warsaw pact and in the soviet union itself he said 
western defense efforts were no obstacle at all to improved 
eastwest relations 
all 16 nato nations attended the portugal meeting except france 
which does not belong to the alliances integrated military 
structure iceland which has no armed forces was present as an 
observer

napa valley vintner daryl sattui feels 
contempt for the thief who stole his wine after it fell from a 
truck whose driver was among those killed in the collapsed oakland 
freeway 
perhaps i can see people stealing something but when theyre 
stealing under those circumstances i can think that even a thief 
might not stoop to do it said sattui whose greatgrandfather 
vittorio started making wine in 1885 today none of the sattui 
wine is sold in stores only at the winery and by subscription 
in a rented truck driver gary k watson of napa was northbound 
on the lower roadway of the doubledeck nimitz freeway when the 
quake hit his cargo headed for shipment to customers was 70 
nineliter cases of wine from the v sattui winery in st helena 
neither sattui nor most of the people from the winery personally 
knew watson who was a temporary hire for the upcoming holiday 
season 
watsons truck was crushed and watson was killed along with at 
least 38 others but four plasticfoampacked cases of sattui wine 
some of it the 100abottle 1981 cabernet sauvignon reserve 
plummeted 40 feet to the street 
for six days the surviving bottles sat on the street skirted 
by rescue workers in the desperate search for survivors from the 
pancaked tons of concrete and twisted steel at one point they were 
gathered and stacked neatly under the freeway out of the way 
they had become an eloquent symbol of priorities amid the death 
and destruction rescuers looked at the wine but nobody touched it 
i aint thinking about it at all much less taking it or 
drinking it a man said the night of the earthquake besides 
it would be wrong real wrong to take anything from this horrible 
place that aint yours 
on the seventh day monday somebody stole the bottles 
makes my skin crawl rescue worker warner brown told the san 
francisco chronicle whoever got it he can have it i bet 
some guy thought about that nice wine all week temptation 
finally just got the better of his sense deep down he doesnt 
really want that wine

after years of insisting that his name be 
welded to a law requiring sharp cuts in the federal deficit sen 
ernest f hollings wants a divorce from the grammrudmanhollings 
deficit reduction act 
i want a divorce because they are using the law as a shield to 
hide behind instead of as a sword to spur us in the right 
direction the south carolina democrat said in an interview 
wednesday 
i want a divorce on grounds of infidelity and irreconcilable 
differences he said abandoning his oncestrong campaign to make 
sure the legislation was referred to as grammrudmanhollings 
instead of just grammrudman 
hollings accused his partners in shaping the act sens warren 
rudman rnh and phil gramm rtexas of succumbing to a numbers 
game in which figures are shifted from column to column the budget 
debate is dominated by smoke and mirrors and the defict goes up 
not down 
i think thats blasphemy he said i need a divorce 
hollings said that the process actually worked in the first two 
years after the passage of the defict reduction bill in 1985 
we cut 113 billion he said 
but then hollings said an agreement between congress and the 
white house started the monkeyshines and the subterfuge 
it was a game of anything you can do i can do better he 
said 
and we know its fraudulent 
hollings accused gramm of arguing for truth in budgeting while 
at the same time leading the pack on the senate floor to take 
the bailout of the faltering savings and loan industry out of the 
budget process 
hollings complained of the use of other tricks and dodges to 
avoid the money bite in the law he helped create 
for example he said that a savings of 29 billion was claimed 
by moving a payday at the pentagon to sept 29 from oct 1 placing 
it in the 1989 fiscal year instead of the current 1990 fiscal year 
for a while he said the annual deficit actually did turn 
modestly downward 
now were going up and up were not even going in the right 
direction he said

and a courtappointed medical guardian will make the decision to 
give the infant blood if alternative treatments are exhausted 
lowengrub said 
the infant has not yet needed a transfusion but hospital 
officials sought the order as a precaution after learning of the 
parents objections to the procedure 
the infant weighing nearly five pounds was delivered six weeks 
prematurely by caesarean section sunday the baby was pale and was 
kept on a ventilator for the first 48 hours according to court 
documents 
neonatal specialists at the hospital said the infant could be at 
risk because of low blood pressure and a low hemoglobin rate the 
hospital even reduced blood sampling to conserve the infants blood 
supply according to dr margaret fernandes chief of the 
neonatology unit 
lowengrub first signed a temporary order tuesday allowing 
doctors to perform blood transfusions if necessary after a hearing 
wednesday the judge extended his order for the duration of the 
infants hospitalization 
the parents of the baby boy identified in court documents only 
as baby caban had objected to the procedure saying it was 
against their beliefs as jehovahs witnesses to allow the 
transfusion of blood or blood products into their bodies 
followers of the faith believe transfusions go against the 
teachings of the bible citing a passage of leviticus that reads 
whatsoever man eats any manner of blood i will cut him off 
from among his people 
what they want to do is follow their religious tenets said 
carl a price the parents attorney who would not identify the 
willingboro couple they want to be able to make the decision 
about any medical treatment that they would receive and their child 
would receive 
lowengrub however rejected their arguments 
parents may choose to become martyrs themselves but they 
cannot make martyrs of their children the judge said the 
right to belief is absolute but the exercise of that belief is 
not 
under lowengrubs order the couple will make all other medical 
decisions for their child 
michael brennan the hospitals attorney said the hospital has 
sought similar orders at least twice but has never had to give 
transfusions to patients who objected 
he said the infants condition has improved and he may not need 
a transfusion

suburban students see detroit as a city of 
ratinfested rundown buildings where murder and drugdealing are 
rampant city students see the suburbs as havens of expensive cars 
plush homes and spoiled brats 
some of them traded places wednesday after swapping stories the 
day before and both found out how wrong they were 
they think we all have perfect lives said shannon doak a 
17yearold senior at dearborns edsel ford high school there 
are drugs in the suburbs too you just dont hear about it 
hearing about the differences and learning to recognize and 
respect them are the aims of the exchange arranged by new detroit 
inc an urban coalition founded in 1967 after race riots 
devastated much of the city 
the teachers see that the students have a different attitude 
just with the one day they spend in another school vivian 
buffington a race relations consultant who organized the program 
said wednesday 
the new detroit exchange program was started four years ago to 
promote intercultural harmony and slow racial prejudice among 
teenagers 
students chosen to participate through a variety of methods 
say some of their biggest misconceptions come from home 
my parents dont know both sides and i think i can help them 
see that detroit isnt what they think it is aliza pearlberg a 
17yearold senior at southfieldlathrup high school said after 
tuesdays session at mercy college in detroit 
curtis davenport from the interfaith center for racial justice 
in mount clemens said students find a conflict between what they 
learn at sessions like tuesdays and what they hear at home 
its tough for them because a lot of their parents are trying 
to socialize them in different beliefs davenport said 
in tuesdays sessions students from the city and outlying 
suburbs formed groups of 30 and played games designed to raise 
consciousness to racial equality 
one game required students from suburbs to draw their 
impressions of the city while students from detroit drew their 
concepts of the suburbs 
i get upset that people think youre a charity case if you 
come from detroit said wade brown a 17yearold detroit 
resident and senior at university liggett school in fashionable 
grosse pointe woods they think that you have only one parent and 
live in a slum 
participants in this weeks program one of two held each school 
year were 354 students and 48 teachers

residents of a southern chile community 
on wednesday mourned the death of a baby whale that it adopted 
three months ago after the creature took refuge in a local cove 
with its mother 
but fishermen in the village of punta lavapie reacted 
differently they butchered the 26footlong right whale 
tomito or tommy for food after it died monday in arauco gulf 
all arauco is hurting the local governor eugenia cofre 
was quoted as saying wednesday in the santiago daily la segunda 
the whale and its mother arrived in july at the cove near punta

are largeheaded with wrinkles on the throat and chest and 
nicknamed them tomito and ema

marine biologists the scientists said the newborn whale was being 
nurtured until it was big enough to endure the rigors of a 
migratory trip to antartica for feeding 
but the whale was found dead on a rocky beach monday according 
to santiago newspapers the cause of death was unclear but some 
newspapers said it may have been slashed by a fishing boats 
propeller

two members of congress plan a trip to lebanon 
to urge christian leader michel aoun to accept a proposed peace 
plan despite warnings from the state department that their 
security cannot be guaranteed sources said wednesday 
reps mary rose oakar dohio and nick rahall dwva both of 
lebaneseamerican descent are seeking a meeting with gen aoun 
the leader of lebanons predominantly christian army who has 
withheld his acceptance of the proposal to end the countrys 
14year civil war the sources said they spoke only on condition 
of anonymity 
rahalls office declined to discuss his trip saying we can 
neither confirm nor deny it for security reasons a spokesman 
for ms oakar said he could not obtain information about her plans 
the white house meanwhile rejected any us attempt to 
influence aoun thats an internal matter for lebanon and the 
various factions there to deal with said presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
president bush did discuss the prospects for peace in lebanon in 
telephone calls monday and tuesday with pope john paul ii 
president francois mitterrand of france and king fahd of saudi 
arabia fitzwater said 
bush expressed hope the plan would be a step in the direction 
of lebanese reform said fitzwater 
the plan adopted by 63 lebanese legislators after three weeks 
of closeddoor meetings in saudi arabia would shift political 
control from the christian minority to the moslem majority in an 
attempt to end the countrys 14year civil war 
aoun who declared a war of liberation in march to drive the 
40000 syrian troops from the country called on the lebanese 
lawmakers to reject the plan when it comes up for a vote next month 
because it fails to set a deadline for a syrian pullout 
oakar and rahall are no strangers to the dangers of lebanon in 
1982 they visited beirut at the height of the israeli invasion to 
offer their support for the lebanese people and condemn the 
fighting 
but state department officials said the situation now is far 
more dangerous because the us embassy has been evacuated and the 
two lawmakers would be completely dependent for their security on 
their lebanese hosts 
we dont oppose their talking to him aoun but we cant 
offer any support or help if they get in trouble said one 
official who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
state department guidelines prohibit travel by americans to 
lebanon in most cases the situation in lebanon is so dangerous 
that no us citizen can be considered safe from terrorist acts 
according to the guidelines 
us passports are invalid for travel to lebanon unless special 
permission is obtained violation of this ban can be punishable by 
imprisonment or a fine the guidelines say 
there are eight americans missing in lebanon all believed to 
have been kidnapped in the past five years by proiranian radicals 
the embassy was evacuated last month after aoun made veiled 
threats to take american hostages in order to draw attention to his 
fight for expulsion of the syrians

hong kong cannot accommodate much longer 43000 
vietnamese boat people who mainly are economic refugees britich 
foreign secretary john major said wednesday 
it is soon going to be necessary to tackle the thorny problem 
of involuntary repatriation major told the house of commons in 
response to a question about the refugees in the british colony 
it is not reasonable to accept that they will have to stay in 
hong kong forever and i cannot and will not accept that 
we are seeking to cajole and persuade the vietnamese boat 
people to return but i now have to recognize that the problem in 
hong kong is acute and getting worse and cannot be borne much 
longer major said 
some legislators of the governing conservative party and the 
labor opposition expressed concern over majors comments 
gerald kaufman labors foreign affairs spokesman said the 
refugees left vietnam because the country was poor and that they 
had to be dealt with in a humanitarian way 
i think if we are going to have a solution which is humane yet 
effective economic aid to vietnam on a substantial scale has 
got to be part of the answer he told channel 4 news 
james lester a conservative said the united nations and the 
european economic community should help improve life in vietnam 
unless we can do that many of us will have grave concerns 
about repatriation he said 
a foreign office spokesman said that the 13000 vietnamese who 
arrived in hong kong before 1988 qualified for refugee status 
because of religious or political persecution 
however the vast majority of the 43000 vietnamese who have 
arrived since june 1988 are expected to be disqualified on grounds 
they left their homeland only to seek a better living elsewhere 
the spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
only 386 refugees have agreed to return home from hong kong 
voluntarily since september 1988 he said

president bushs veto of a bill to provide 
abortion assistance to impoverished victims of rape and incest was 
sustained in the house on wednesday as a 231191 vote to override 
him fell 51 votes short of the necessary twothirds margin 
though narrow in scope the bill carried symbolic importance in 
the widening political struggle over the abortion issue and 
proponents took their loss with a vow to keep the presidents feet 
to the fire but rep chris smith rnj called it a decisive 
victory for the prolife movement 
the president won a legislative victory today with use of a 
legislative minority said rep les aucoin dore he will put 
his party at tremendous risk in the next election and some of his 
allies on the house floor will not be returned 
a republican rep bill green of new york who supported the 
bill said president bush may well have stumbled on the one issue 
that could cost him reelection 
the vote in which 42 republicans joined 189 democrats in the 
unsuccessful bid to enact the bill over the presidents veto left 
intact an 8yearold ban of federal financing of abortions for poor 
women except when their lives are threatened 
were pleased said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
it shows strong support for the presidents position 
the disputed provision would have permitted medicaid abortions 
for women who are victims of rape or incest and who reported 
promptly to authorities it was part of a spending bill that now 
goes back to the house appropriations committee for revision 
smith and other abortion opponents said the vote demonstrated 
they can overcome future efforts to weaken the prohibition on most 
medicaid abortions adding that it shows the political ground has 
not shifted in favor of abortion rights as some political 
strategists argue 
they made the mistake of thinking this was a oneround 
fight said rep vin weber rminn 
some members who were panicked by proabortion propaganda in 
the last few weeks are going to be surprised because the final 
tale hasnt been told on how this issue is cutting more liberal language 
had passed 
the house although it had easily cleared the senate 
abortionrights supporters picked up a net 15 votes on the 
override vote but some of those who switched positions said they 
did so for other reasons since the vote affected the entire 1567 
billion spending bill 
fiftynine democrats and 132 republicans voted to sustain the 
veto 
eleven members did not vote including rep james courter a 
republican who running for governor of new jersey and who has been 
accused of waffling on the abortion issue his opponent democratic 
rep james florio voted to override and later said courter chose 
to say this was not an issue of enough importance to adjust his 
schedule to be here 
smith the antiabortion leader attributed most of the switches 
to other issues but said there were a few marginal members who 
have capitulated 
house speaker tom foley dwash said democrats had not decided 
on their next move house democratic whip bill gray dpa said he 
did not think democrats would attempt to add similar abortion 
language again to the same appropriations bill 
leaders of the move to liberalize medicaid abortions held out 
that possibility however and said in any event they would raise 
the issue repeatedly by attempting to add similar language to other 
bills 
we will keep coming back said rep barbara boxer dcalif 
the vote followed an emotionpacked debate on the house floor 
abortionrights forces condemned bushs veto as an 
unconscionable infringement on the rights of poor women and 
children victimized by rape and incest and one that will bring 
political damage to republicans 
abortion foes cast the issue as a moral one that would invite 
widespread federal financing of abortions 
rep henry hyde rill author of the current ban known as the 
hyde amendment pleaded dont force death upon an innocent 
victim 
rep steny hoyer dmd raised the name of willie horton the 
man who republicans and the bush campaign cited last year as 
evidence that democratic opponent michael dukakis the governor of 
massachusetts was soft on crime horton had raped a maryland woman 
while on furlough from a massachusetts prison 
god was gracious and willie horton did not impregnate that 
woman hoyer said but if he had which one of us would 
have stood before her and said carry willie hortons baby to 
term 
in an indication of how politically difficult the vote was 
regarded the house republican leader rep robert michel rill 
said he would vote with bush while suggesting he could change 
positions later

rescue workers wednesday dug through 
tons of dirt and debris from a landslide that buried a sao paulo 
shantytown killing at least three people injuring dozens and 
leaving at least 90 missing 
however officials said they had little hope of finding 
survivors from tuesdays accident which occurred after a 
100foothigh hill of dirt from construction sites collapsed at the 
nova republica slum 
fire department maj luiz roberto carchedi said shantytown 
community leaders estimated more than 90 people were missing 
but that does not mean they are all dead carchedi said 
because we are sure that many of those unaccounted for are in 
temporary shelters 
we may never know how many people were killed he added 
at least three people died and dozens of slum dwellers were 
injured tuesday evening in the landslide fire officials said 
we heard a loud roar and the ground shook and we ran for the 
door maria dos prazeres a survivor said in a televised 
interview we just had time to move before the walls came 
crashing down on us 
a total of 56 wood and brick shacks were buried lt francisco 
tenorio de albuquerque of the fire department said 
the chances of finding anyone still alive beneath all this 
rubble are extremely remote but we will continue searching because 
we can never give up hope carchedi said 
several of the shacks were buried underneath 45 feet of dirt 
carchedi said 
firemen policemen civil defense workers and volunteers using 
bulldozers backhoes shovels and in many cases their bare hands 
worked nonstop wednesday digging through mud in search of victims 
four specially trained police dogs scoured the area looking for 
survivors 
carchedi a rescue coordinator said three bodies had been 
pulled out and that about 20 people were treated for injuries at an 
emergency treatment center set up near the slum 
survivors at the scene said about 400 people lived in 100 shacks 
in the neighborhood 
the landfill was made of dirt excavated from construction sites 
around the city and illegally dumped next to the shantytown said 
geraldo jacob an employee of the public works department in sao 
paulo 
he said the earth was loose and slid away because of underground 
streams that eroded its base 
fernando luiz prandini a geologist of the sao paulo 
universitys institute for technological research surveyed the 
area and estimated about 600000 tons of earth collapsed

defense efforts to move the trial of a police 
officer charged in the fatal shooting of a black motorcylist 
suffered a setback wednesday when the judge cut off the hearing and 
resumed screening jurors 
lawyers for colombianborn miami officer william lozano contend 
he cannot get a fair trial on two manslaughter charges in miami 
because jurors might fear that an innocent verdict would touch off 
rioting 
lozanos shooting of clement lloyd 23 who was being chased by 
police led to three days of racial violence in january the 
suspended officer is also charged in the death of lloyds 
passenger allan blanchard 24 killed in the subsequent crash 
lozano said lloyd tried to run him over and he fired in 
selfdefense some witnesses disputed his account and called the 
shooting unwarranted 
the january riot was the fourth related to police slayings of 
black men in miami during the 1980s two disturbances followed 
acquittals of officers 
dade circuit judge joseph farina had sharply limited the 
documents and witnesses defense attorney roy black could use to 
request the change of venue and on wednesday after they were 
submitted indicated he was in no hurry to rule on the issue 
he cut off the defense presentation and spent the rest of 
wednesday completing preliminary screening of a pool of more than 
220 potential jurors 
there very well may be posttrial difficulties said farina 
but we dont need individuals testifying to that 
the case was recessed until monday when questioning of jurors 
will continue the questioning of jurors with 15 minutes per side 
for each potential juror could take three weeks attorneys said 
outoftown depositions are being taken the rest of the week 
clearly were disappointed black said outside the 
courtroom its unfair to have a trial with jurors who are 
concerned with something other than guilt or innocence 
prosecutors has sought to quash blacks subpoenas but did not 
dispute the threat of violence in case of acquittal 
there is a degree of probability that a riot will occur 
said roy wood an assistant dade county attorney 
black had also fought for a change of venue in the case of 
officer luis alvarez who in 1984 was acquitted in the 1982 video 
arcade shooting of nevell johnson both the slaying and the 
innocent verdict led to disturbances 
but the attorney said the situations are different 
the atmosphere in this courthouse and the atmosphere in the 
community are far worse this time black said

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
wednesday further sanctions against south africa would be 
inappropriate now because of steps the countrys new government is 
taking toward the black majority 
baker said he refused to choose sides in the commonwealth 
dispute in which british prime minister margaret thatcher refused 
to go along with a call by other commonwealth leaders for further 
sanctions 
instead he reiterated that the united states is committed to 
ending apartheid by assisting blacks in south africa economically 
and politically and would work through diplomcy to resolve 
conflicts 
were going to continue to work with our allies to support 
change in south africa and were going to try and continue to work 
with the us congress to develop a bipartisan approach baker 
said 
he said action taken by president fw de klerk and his 
government in recent weeks is clearly a step in the right 
direction and i think that that step argues for continued patience 
with respect to the question of further sanctions 
i think it would be inappropriate now to move forward with 
further sanctions in the light of the efforts of that new 
government obvious efforts of that new government to move in the 
right direction baker said 
baker didnt refer specifically to steps taken by the de klerk 
government such as freeing of imprisoned black leaders and 
permitting antiapartheid demonstrating 
the united states has said since september that it doesnt think 
sanctions should be increased now but that it might reevaluate its 
position if negotiations between the south african government and 
blacks fail to achieve progress by next summer

the bush administration will send a delegation 
to a conference on global warming next month in the netherlands 
but is not prepared to commit itself to action against the problem 
officials said wednesday 
epa administrator william k reilly who will head the 
delegation said the administrations policy on global warming has 
yet to be worked out 
reilly said it is premature to call for a commitment to freeze 
emissions by the year 2000 of the greenhouse gases these are 
gases whose accumulation in the atmosphere is according to most 
scientists warming the globe 
the dutch government is expected to propose such a freeze of 
carbon dioxide emissions at the 68nation conference nov 67 near 
the hague carbon dioxide a product of burning fossil fuels and 
cutting down forests is the principal warming gas 
president bush promised during his election campaign last year 
to convene a similar international conference on global warming 
but nothing has been done reilly in a meeting with reporters did 
not discuss the presidents campaign promise 
the administration reportedly has been divided on how aggressive 
a role the united states should assume in confronting global 
warming 
according to administration sources it was not clear until 
earlier this week that reilly actually would go to the conference 
which will be attended by environmental ministers from the around 
the world 
christopher flavin an expert on global warming issues for 
worldwatch institute an environmentally oriented research group 
said the flap over whether reilly would attend the conference was 
seen by many european officials as further indication that the 
united states is not prepared to lead the effort to deal with 
global warming 
this is a major meeting its been in the planning stage 
for better part of a year the united states just doesnt have its 
act together said flavin 
flavin said that most european governments favor specific 
commitments for reducing carbon dioxide emissions 
according to administration sources who have discussed the 
question on condition they not be identified reilly has championed 
a more aggressive response to the global warming concern and has 
favored taking specific proposals to the meeting in the netherlands 
others in the administration including the presidents science 
adviser d allan bromley have cautioned against moving too 
quickly they argue there has yet to emerge a clear scientific 
consensus on the impact of the socalled greenhouse effect nor 
have the economic ramifications of a curb on the burning of fossil 
fuels been made clear 
reilly refused to discuss the internal disagreements within the 
administration 
he told reporters that a whole range of questions remain 
about global warming and how to respond these questions should be 
answered before the administration decides on specific commitments 
for curbing greenhouse pollutants he suggested

the secret police will disband undercover 
units and turn off listening devices to try to win public 
acceptance and prestige and a place in polands reforms 
commanders said wednesday 
freed from watching opposition activists many now hold posts 
in the east blocs first noncommunist government security forces 
can turn to fighting an alarming rise in property crimes spawned by 
polands economic crisis the officials said 
the functionaries of the security service not only fully 
accept these changes but are aware that the changes are 
irreversible said jerzy karpacz deputy chief of the secret 
police 
if any are found with a different view they will have to 
leave the force he said 
karpacz was joined by the deputy commander of the police and the 
spokesman for the interior ministry at a news conference that 
opened the secret department to unusual scrutiny 
it is obvious that the understanding interpretation and 
realization of the job of the interior ministry depends 
directly on the broader social and political conditions of the 
country said spokesman wojciech garstka 
that is why there will be changes perhaps the deepest in 
postwar history in the way some responsibilities in the interior 
ministry will be implemented garstka said 
the despised secret police long symbolized communist control by 
fear they are remembered as executors of stalinist purges 
clandestine monitors of the opposition and interrogators of 
activists 
three rogue officers and their commander from the socalled 
fourth department which spied on religious associations were 
convicted of the 1984 kidnapping and murder of the rev jerzy 
popieluszko a charismatic solidarity priest whose bound body was 
dumped in a river 
the fourth department and five other units including those 
responsible for surveillance of citizens loyalty and protection of 
the agricultural manufacturing and arms industries have been 
liquidated in the reform drive garstka said 
also dissolved are archaic units that inspected foreign mail 
for secret messages and monitored foreign radio transmissions 
garstka said along with the political education unit 
there will be much less frequent use of secret observation 
wiretapping and eavesdropping and only with the permission of the 
court or the prosecutors office he said 
the most radical changes will be in the secret police the 
tasks of protecting internal security in the case of a 
parliamentary democracy and political pluralism has to be 
understood and executed in an essentially different manner from the 
past garstka said 
as long as any opposition was illegal it was treated as a 
threat since the considerable majority of the opposition has 
become legal its representatives are in the parliament they 
have ceased to be an object of interest to the secret police he 
said 
three new secret police units will be formed one will protect 
the constitutional order against political extremists and 
terrorists who do not want to become legal under new freedoms 
another will safeguard the economy against espionage and disruption 
and the third will analyze security information and work on crime 
prevention garstka said 
with poland still the object of increased interest from 
foreign intelligence services counterintelligence efforts will 
be strengthened garstka siad 
acknowledging an expansion of the secret police ranks over the 
years garstka said the department will be limited to 7 percent of 
the interior ministry or about 7500 posts 
greater importance will be put on public safety and protecting 
property garstka said and some secret police officers will be 
transferred to help with a national alert issued to combat an 
alarming rise in thefts and burglaries 
there are about 1250 crimes per 100000 people annually which 
garstka said was relatively low by western standards but 
increasing incidents of car breakins and other crimes are being 
reported as the economic situation worsens and the division between 
the welltodo and the impoverished widens 
the 12500member paramilitary zomo riot police disbanded in a 
symbolic move sept 29 will be replaced by prevention squads 
of 5177 officers in 22 of the 49 provinces they will be 
supplemented by 13000 men serving in the police as an alternative 
to mandatory military duty garstka said 
interior ministry officials were questioned about confiscations 
of oncebanned underground publications the privileges supposedly 
provided to security forces and what would happen to the 
information gathered through surveillance 
they said material confiscated but not destroyed following court 
procedures might be returned if proper application was made 
as the secret police units were disbanded all the resources 
were listed and in cases in which analyses were not useful they 
were destroyed karpacz said 
he denied that a special unit existed to monitor foreign 
journalists but would not answer directly whether their offices and 
homes were bugged 
interior minister czeslaw kiszczak one of four remaining 
communists in the 24member solidarityled cabinet has recommended 
that the prime minister create an advisory committee representing 
polands political forces to deepen societys control of the 
interior ministry garstka said 
interior ministry officers were brought together this month for 
a twoday seminar during which kiszczak gave a lecture on how they 
should work in the new conditions the spokesman said 
acting in a responsible and cautious way according to law 
with professionalism openly informing society about their actions 
and problems the interior ministry is going to strive for public 
acceptance and prestige he said

israel on wednesday protested a call by pope 
john paul ii for creation of a palestinian homeland 
we cannot but express the deep feeling of disappointment over 
the statement made by the pope and our hope that the catholic 
church and those leading it would finally conduct a soulsearching 
regarding the political reality of these days said minister ehud 
olmert who is responsible for arab affairs 
he made his statement in parliament on behalf of the israeli 
cabinet 
the pope spoke about the difficult conflict which is torturing 
for all of us and mentioned another people in a style reminiscent 
of past relations with the church that we considered long gone 
olmert said 
in a brief speech sunday john paul expressed solidarity with 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip who have 
been rebelling against israeli rule the past 22 months 
from the holy land come calls for help and solidarity from the 
inhabitants of the west bank and from gaza the pope said they 
are the cries of an entire people which today is particularly tired 
and feels weaker after decades of conflict with another people 
linked to the same land by their history and their faith 
he added i would like to express to these people my most 
profound solidarity assuring them that the pope continues to make 
his own their legitimate request to live in peace in a country of 
their own respecting the rights of every other people to enjoy the 
necessary security and tranquility 
the statement did not specifically mention the jewish people or 
israel with which the vatican has no diplomatic relations 
israel opposes formation of an independent palestinian state 
fearing it would threaten israels security prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs likud bloc and other rightwing parties view the occupied 
territories as an integral part of israel 
the plos parliamentinexile from its headquarters in tunisia 
last year declared palestine as an independent state without giving 
specific boundaries israel refuses to speak to the plo which it 
considers a terrorist group 
 
shamirs adviser avi pazner reacting to the popes statement 
was quoted monday by the englishlanguage jerusalem post as saying 
the popes concern for a homeland for the palestinians is very 
peculiar in light of the fact that despite the 40 years of israels 
existence the vatican has yet to recognize or show the same 
concern for the homeland of the jewish people

the justice department said wednesday that a 
court decision allowing former president reagans papers to be 
subpoenaed for an irancontra trial raised a serious question 
about the institution of the presidency 
comments by chief spokesman david runkel appeared to signal that 
top justice department officials were studying the possibility of 
supporting reagan in any challenge to subpoenas for notes and 
diaries for use as evidence by former national security adviser 
john m poindexter 
runkel emphasized that the department has not formulated a 
position on tuesdays ruling by the trial judge in poindexters 
case and wouldnt do so without consulting with reagans private 
attorney theodore b olson 
but the spokesman said the ruling by us district judge harold 
greene does raise a serious question about the institution of the 
presidency 
the judges decision would allow for the subpoenaing of 
material from president reagan that dealt with discussions he had 
when he was president runkel said we intend to take a look at 
that 
runkel refused to discuss in more specific detail the nature of 
the justice departments reaction to greenes ruling 
asked if the department was considering a claim the papers are 
protected by executive privilege runkel said only the 
possibilities are wide i expect 
olson declined to comment about whether reagan would resist 
subpoenas 
poindexter is accused of obstructing various congressional 
inquiries into the irancontra affair he contends that reagans 
diaries and notes taken during their frequent meetings will show 
that the former president authorized many of his actions in the 
irancontra affair 
greene held that if such diaries and notes contain relevant 
information poindexter is entitled to subpoena them for use as 
evidence at the trial set to begin jan 22 
among other things poindexter contends that he and reagan 
discussed a false chronology of the administrations arms sales to 
iran that is the subject of four of the charges against the former 
national security adviser 
in his request for documents poindexter cited notes taken by 
the former president and others during his meetings with reagan as 
well as presidential diaries 
prosecutors for independent counsel lawrence e walsh were 
allowed to read and take notes from typewritten extracts of 
reagans diaries that were prepared by the white house 
the diaries remain in reagans custody and he claims they are 
his personal property according to filings in the case 
greene ruled that poindexters attorneys may issue subpoenas for 
documents kept by reagan or at the national archives the subpoenas 
would be returnable by nov 23 the judge refused to authorize 
poindexter to subpoena similar records from thenvice president 
bush 
under the presidential records and materials and preservation 
act a former president may invoke executive privilege to prevent 
the archives from releasing certain papers the law however does 
not extend this privilege to subpoenas for material needed as 
evidence in a criminal trial 
moreover the supreme court unanimously ruled in 1973 that 
thenpresident nixon could not invoke executive privilege to 
withhold tape recordings of his oval office conversations for use 
as evidence in the watergate prosecutions 
the high court ruled that although a president has an executive 
privilege over his papers it cannot be invoked to prevent use of 
papers deemed relevant to a criminal trial

investors on wednesday snapped up the first of 
what will be 30 billion in special government bonds sold to 
finance the savings and loan bailout 
buyers bid an average yield of 815 percent on 452 billion in 
30year bonds issued by the resolution funding corp called 
refcorp 
the premium over regular treasury 30year bonds which yielded 
788 percent on wednesday was 027 percentage points about what 
treasury department officials were expecting 
economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a government 
securities dealer in new york said investors demand the premium 
because the government guarantee of interest payments on the 
refcorp bonds is not as strong as the full faith and credit 
guarantee given direct government borrowing 
considering all of that i think it was really well bid for 
the bonds were really well received and came in at about the spread 
expected he said 
in the fiscal year ended sept 30 the government borrowed 20 
billion for sampls directly the complex funding compromise put 
together by the administration and congress calls for an additional 
30 billion in borrowing through refcorp by sept 30 1991 regular 
quarterly auctions are planned 
the refcorp bonds which the bush administration favored have 
the advantage of keeping 30 billion out of the federal budget 
deficit however jones said that if the interest rate difference 
holds at 027 percentage points taxpayers will wind up spending 
243 billion extra for that accounting maneuver

us ambassador thomas r pickering 
delivered a 65 million check for americas un dues wednesday a 
day later than intended 
the us check was meant to be a birthday gift delivered tuesday 
on united nations day commemorating 44 years since the un 
charter came into force on oct 24 1945 
the state department sent an envelope that was to have included 
the check tuesday to the us mission but someone forgot to 
include the check an official said 
pickering instead had to wait another day for the 65 million 
check said the official who was familiar with the mixup and 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said in 
midoctober that the united nations had only 68 million in its 
general fund barely enough to meet expenses through the end of the 
month 
the united states is the un member most in arrears before the 
latest payment america owed more than 495 million to the regular 
budget and 200 million more for peacekeeping activities 
the 65 million will be applied to the 1989 us dues of 216 
million the uns annual budget is about 776 million 
beginning in 1985 the reagan administration began withholding 
some of its the us dues to protest what it said was the 
organizations antiwestern bias inefficiency and budget overruns 
but in september 1988 reagan announced he was pleased with the 
world bodys progress toward budget reform staff cutbacks and a 
new spirit of consensus and cooperation 
reagan left the details of paying the arrears to president bush 
us congressional subcommittees have given preliminary approval 
for payment of 2055 million toward the full 1990 fiscal year 
assessment of 216 million 
however they have rejected state department requests for 46 
million more to pay some of the arrears citing financial 
constraints imposed by the us federal budget deficit

residents and merchants are still 
rebuilding their lives and businesses two years after the whittier 
narrows earthquake painting a sobering forecast for cities heavily 
damaged in the san francisco quake 
patience care and drive are the virtues earthquake veterans 
here recommend for the communities in the san francisco bay region 
and south to santa cruz county that were jolted oct 17 by an 
earthquake that registered 71 on the richter scale 
the recovery effort is a function of the spirit of the people 
affected by the disaster said whittier city manager tom mauk 
once the community comes out of shock plans for rebuilding must 
be made right away he said 
it takes a longer time than anybody thinks mauk said 
theres a lot to do and the key is youve just got to run and 
sprint through it 
speed should be tempered by organization and care for those 
going through the process of applying to government agencies for 
loans and grants and looking for building contractors said bill 
lewis manager of the building rehabilitation department and code 
enforcement 
you always have opportunists lewis said unfortunately 
some of those opportunists are what they call contractors 
the 59magnitude earthquake of oct 1 1987 and a 
53magnitude aftershock three days later caused more than 350 
million damage in greater los angeles including more than 78 
million damage to suburban whittier 
about 5000 homes and businesses were damaged 
lewis said the city of santa cruz which was badly damaged in 
last weeks quake is looking at from two to four years before 
everything is put back together 
its just a massive undertaking he said 
im still running very very skinny saidanthony gonzalez 
who operates a bicycle shop in whittier thats located next door to 
a twostory building laced with earthquake cracks and surrounded by 
a chainlink fence 
its not a positive thing having that building next door he 
said 
most evidence of the quakes collapsed walls shattered glass 
and toppled chimneys has long since been cleared away and the 
town of 73000 bustles with traffic and shoppers but it is clear 
that repairs and replacement of what was lost will go on for years 
the battered whittier theater still slumps in the ruins of its 
facade and a boardedup supermarket waits behind a chainlink fence 
for wreckers to finish what the earthquake began nearly 25 months 
ago 
a pancaked parking structure at the whittier quad shopping 
center is gone along with a multistory department store that was 
the centerpiece but new stores have yet to take shape on the 
freshly graded land 
a dozen lots remain empty in the quaint village business 
district some behind fences bearing optimistic slogans toward 
the future better than ever and developing with beauty 
about 30000 people visited assistance centers in southern 
california after the whittier quake more than 14000 applicants 
got grants for home repairs from the federal emergency management 
agency and the small business administration approved 8400 loan 
applications totaling about 150 million

libyans who arrived by boat to mark a day of mourning declared 
by col moammar gadhafi for libyans deported during italian 
colonial rule 
the libyan cruise ship garnata arrived in port but police barred

statement addressed to the italian government saying they had made 
a voyage of peace to visit the graves of relatives 
authorities said 846 libyan passengers were on board 
libyan representatives met with italian foreign ministry 
officials in an attempt to get the libyans into italy but there

italian news agencies quoting unidentified sources in the 
premiers office said the libyans would not be allowed into the 
country there was no immediate official confirmation 
gadhafi as in other years set aside thursday as a day of 
mourning for libyans deported to italy during colonial rule from

of relatives and take part in demonstrations in rome and other 
cities on thursday 
if they dont get the permits to enter italy they will go 
back to libya libyas ambassador abdel rahman shalgam told 
reporters in rome 
in rome a foreign ministry spokesman said authorities had 
agreed to allow about 200 libyans to come by plane but were taken 
by surprise when gadhafi sent the ship to naples with 800 people 
aboard 
when 800 people arrive at a single port without visas even if 
you wanted to allow them to enter it would take days said the 
official speaking on condition of anonymity as is customary 
about 170 libyans with valid visas did arrive by plane and 
traveled to the tiny italian island of ustica to visit a cemetery 
where libyan deportees were buried 
the italian news agency ansa quoted one of the libyan crew 
members aboard the ship as saying they are all without visas 
because they didnt have time to apply for them it usually takes a 
month to get them from the italian embassy but the trip was 
arranged only a week ago 
all flights and international telecommunications will be halted 
in libya for 12 hours thursday in observance of the day of 
mourning the official libyan news agency jana announced earlier 
this week 
the day is part of gadhafis persistent demand that italy pay 
reparations for its colonial occupation 
the italian government however says italy met its obligations 
with payment of an idemnity of 15 million british pounds at the 
time worth 67 million under a 1956 agreement with the then 
libyan monarchy 
gadhafi deposed the monarchy in a 1969 coup

the new head of the immigration and 
naturalization service said wednesday that he opposed digging a 
4mile ditch in southern california to discourage illegal border 
crossings from mexico 
i dont think the ditch is a very good idea but i think some 
things have to be done along the southern border to stem illegal 
crossings gene mcnary told reporters 
mcnary who was confirmed tuesday by the senate to be ins 
commissioner said one of his top priorities it to get control of 
the budget personnel and procurement in an agency that was 
described by a departing official as totally disorganized 
mcnary said he wanted to secure the border in a humane way 
adding that repairing fences might be an alternative 
mcnary said he accepted as valid some of the criticisms leveled 
at the agency by raymond m momboisse the agencys former general 
counsel who said incompetency at all levels of command render 
many key officials liable to disciplinary charges 
but mcnary refused to say which of the many criticisms of ins 
operation in momboisses 22page memo he considered to be valid 
i appreciate the memo mcnary said he was in a key 
position so his ideas even though they might be biased are ideas 
from an insider i have read the memo and probaby will read it 
again 
the new commissioner who has not been formally sworn into 
office said he wanted to centralize the operations of ins which 
was criticized earlier this year in a justice department audit that 
found mismanagement and waste 
ins ended the last fiscal year with an estimated 30 million 
deficit which one source said resulted from the decentralization 
of agency operations under mcnarys predecessor alan nelson 
mcnarys comments about the drainage ditch which has drawn 
opposition from hispanic organizations and the mexican government 
indicated the government may scrap plans to build it 
attorney general dick thornburgh has yet to approve construction 
of the project which the border patrol said would make it harder 
drivers to smuggle drugs and illegal aliens across the desert near 
san diego 
justice department spokesman daniel eramian said he was unaware 
of any decision on the issue by the attorney general

two lawmakers called wednesday for a 
nationwide consumer boycott of canned tuna imported from countries 
whose fishing fleets use drift nets 
rep peter defazio dore and eni fh faleomavaega american 
samoas nonvoting delegate to congress also urged consumers not 
to purchase tuna from nations whose canneries process fish supplied 
by the driftnet fleets 
defazio said it was his understanding that virtually all of the 
canned tuna imported from southeast asia contained fish caught by 
the driftnet fleets of taiwan japan and south korea and that 
thailand was the principal processor of such fish 
all imported tuna is required to bear the country of origin on 
its label although defazio said such labeling was often in fine 
print 
the united states is the only major market for canned tuna 
importing almost 250 million of driftnetcaught tuna just last 
year defazio said i think american consumers would be willing 
to pay a few cents more for a can of tuna in order to force these 
nations to stop using drift nets 
i have yet to meet an american family that thinks it is a good 
idea to strangle dolphins and other animals in drift nets 
defazio said about 30 percent of the canned tuna sold in the 
united states is imported 
the american market has enormous economic clout and can force 
a change in these fishing technologies said gerry leape 
greenpeaces legislative director for ocean ecology issues 
a greenpeace spokeswoman however said later in the day the 
environmental group was not actually calling for a boycott 
we are not opposed to a boycott but would prefer that things 
be done legislatively said blair palese boycotts are not the 
answer there are better ways to do things we tell people if they 
want to avoid buying tuna thats fine but it is hard for 
consumers to understand what tuna to buy or not to buy 
last week defazio introduced legislation that could lead to a 
us ban on fish imports from nations known to use drift nets or to 
process driftnet catches 
we need to hit them in their pocketbooks defazio told a 
news conference adding that driftnet fleets were effectively 
stripmining the pacific ocean of both tuna and salmon 
defazio said the smallmesh monofilament nets also kill 
thousands of marine mammals sea birds and other marine animals 
annually 
every night these nations drop 30000 miles of net a virtual 
wall of death that could encircle the entire globe defazio said 
if this continues for a few more years we will have a beautiful 
shimmering biological desert off the west coast 
the bush administration has agreed to support a temporary 
moratorium on driftnet fishing on the south pacific but has been 
reluctant to seek a similar ban in either the north pacific or 
internationally 
the administration earlier this summer reached separate 
enforcement and monitoring agreements with taiwan korea and japan 
that state department officials hope will supply adequate 
scientific data for the administration to decide whether to seek an 
international ban 
defazio said further studies were not needed and we do not 
have time for lengthy negotiations

iranian leader ayatollah ali khamenei on 
wednesday lashed out at amnesty international for complaining of 
human rights abuses in iran calling the group a western tool 
in riyadh saudi officials were quoted as saying criticism of 
the kingdoms use of the death penalty is antiislamic 
londonbased amnesty has taken saudi officials to task over the 
issue 
in its annual global survey of human rights released wednesday 
amnesty said 142 executions had been announced by iran last year 
however it said it had learned of at least 1700 secret executions 
the rights group which opposes capital punishment issues 
periodic lists of people executed or jailed for political reasons 
the official islamic republic news agency of iran monitored in 
nicosia quoted khamenei as saying that amnesty issues lists now 
and then for fun to impress other nations and discourage them from 
sympathizing with the islamic republic 
in their propaganda our enemies refer to drug traffickers as 
political dissidents khamenei said at a gathering in tehran 
by its own figures iran has executed more than 1000 purported 
drug traffickers since december 
amnesty and some other independent rights groups believe many 
political prisoners have been hanged as drug smugglers 
all this propaganda is aimed at marring the image of the 
islamic republic the iranian news agency quoted khamenei as 
saying 
in an interview distributed by the official saudi press agency 
interior minister prince nayef bin abdelaziz was quoted wednesday 
as stressing that saudi arabia is a theocratic state ruled by 
islamic law 
these are laws from god inspired to his prophet mohammed 
he was quoted as saying 
under that law islamic courts may prescribe beheading by the 
sword and crucifixion for those convicted of heresy or murder the 
chopping off of hands and feet for thieves and stoning for 
adulterers 
in saudi arabia convicted murderers are routinely beheaded in 
public squares in front of mosques after friday prayers 
while the interview did not specifically mention amnesty saudi 
arabias beheading of 16 moslem shiites of kuwaiti nationality last 
month brought condemnation by amnesty and other groups 
the 16 were convicted by islamic courts of planting bombs at the 
height of the islamic pilgrimage to mecca on july 10 one pakistani 
pilgrim was killed and 16 other pilgrims were injured

the justice department said wednesday it will 
pay 170000 to settle a lawsuit by a woman who claims her late 
husband was illegally discredited by the fbis cointelpro domestic 
surveillance program 
the settlement ends a dispute over information the justice 
department says would endanger national security if it were 
publicly disclosed in the course of the litigation 
the department invoked the statesecret privilege to protect the 
information but an appeals court ruled that the plaintiff could 
proceed with the lawsuit notwithstanding government concerns about 
national security 
the justice department appealed the ruling to the supreme court 
but as part of the settlement will withdraw its petition for 
highcourt review of the case 
the justice department said it agreed to pay lillie albertson 
170000 to settle her claim that the fbi forced her late husbands 
expulsion from the communist party in 1964 by making it appear that 
he was an fbi or police informant 
mrs albertson had claimed that fbi agents in new york planted a 
fictious report in a car used by party members to make it appear 
that her husband was an informant 
as part of the settlement mrs albertson agreed to drop her 
lawsuit along with a freedom of information act claim for release 
of government documents the department said 
both sides stipulated that the settlement was not an admission 
of liability or fault by the us government or any employees 
the department said 
mrs albertson also agreed to join the justice department in 
asking the us circuit court of appeals here to vacate last 
aprils opinions on the statesecret question this would mean the 
appellate court decision would not have any legal significance as a 
precedent 
in a split decision a threejudge panel rejected the justice 
departments request that it order dismissal of the lawsuit in the 
ground that state secrets would be revealed 
the court rejected the justice departments assertion that 
evidence of the governments activities of 20 to 30 years ago 
will result in the disclosure of state secrets today 
in an unusual move the court published a censored version of a 
dissent by judge douglas ginsburg twelve of the 18 pages of 
ginsburgs opinion were deleted because they contained classified 
information 
ginsburg said the government had a legitimate and compelling 
interest in preventing disclosure of exceedingly senstive national 
security information 
he cited an affidavit by assistant fbi director james h geer 
head of the bureaus intelligence division that disclosure of 
evidence would pose a serious risk to the personal safety of 
government informants and cause serious damage to national 
security 
kate martin an attorney for the american civil liberties union 
which represented mrs albertson called the settlement a victory 
for her client

fifteen house members including four 
republicans who had earlier opposed a measure to finance 
abortions for poor women in the case of rape or incest sided 
wednesday with the prochoice faction by voting to override 
president bushs veto 
ive thought a lot about this said frank pallone dnj 
saying he concluded it was a womans decision whether to have an 
abortion i dont think ive been elected to come down here and 
make those decisions for them 
but he was among the few who had a true change of heart on the 
issue 
rep william natcher dky who led debate for the democrats 
is chairman of the subcommittee that produced the massive spending 
bill for labor health and education programs which contains the 
expanded medicaid coverage for abortions 
natcher voted to override bushs veto but said he is not in 
favor of abortion 
i have never voted for an amendment or a bill that legalized 
abortion said natcher who voted no oct 11 when the house 
took a prochoice turn by approving 216206 the amendment to 
include rape and incest as reasons a woman could get medicaid to 
pay for her abortion 
i like george bush hes wrong this time he said before 
voting to override 
an aide to rep george gekas rpa said her boss has always 
been in favor of a womans right to an abortion in the case of 
rape incest or to save the life of the mother 
his problem with the amendment added oct 11 was with an 
unrelated section relating to hypodermic needles for drug addicts 
the needle language was modified by the time the bill got to the 
president so gekas had no reason to want the bill vetoed said his 
press secretary joelle ziemian 
rep john duncan rtenn voted to override the veto because he 
supported the many programs other than abortion that would be 
funded by the bill said his spokesman 
he did not see todays vote on a abortion but for education 
and other programs said aide jim edwards 
rep william broomfield rmich who also opposed the oct 11 
language known as the boxer amendment issued a statement after his 
vote wednesday to override the presidents veto saying 
i just dont believe that anyone who is a victim of rape or 
incest should be denied this right if it is legal for someone who 
can afford it how can we make it illegal for a victim of rape or 
incest who is poor 
the other 10 members who opposed the boxer amendment but voted 
to override bushs veto were reps james clarke dnc george 
darden dga sam gibbons dfla lee hamilton dind matthew 
mchugh dny charles pashayan rcalif carl perkins dky 
nick rahall dwva bruce vento dminn and jamie whitten 
dmiss 
meanwhile three house members who had supported the boxer 
amendment sided with bushs veto 
both reps helen bentley rmd and porter goss rfla said 
they supported a womans right to an abortion in the cases of rape 
incest or to save her life but are opposed to using federal funds 
for the procedure 
they both said that the amendment proposed by rep barbara 
boxer dcalif that they favored was on preference not funding 
and that their vote to sustain the bush veto was consistent with 
their opposition to the use of federal money for abortions 
rep alfred mccandless rala said his vote to sustain bushs 
veto had nothing to do with abortion he said he opposes the level 
of funding for the three agencies in the appropriations package 
and that he still believes as demonstrated by his vote oct 11 in 
favor of the boxer amendment that a woman has a right to a 
federally funded abortion in cases of rape incest or to save her 
life

republican and democratic senators clashed 
wednesday on the magnitude of aid to noncommunist governments in 
poland and hungary with democrats accusing president bush of 
committing billions for war but only small change for peace 
republicans counterattacked charging democrats with attempting 
to solve polands serious economic problems with a flood of 
taxpayers money which they said would only serve to bail out 
failed socialist dinosaurs 
we have to be very careful and pragmatic about what we propose 
to do said senate republican leader bob dole of kansas there 
should not be a contest about how much money we can drag out of the 
us treasury 
some have complained that there are those in this body who are 
doing this to embarrass the president of the united states that is 
simply wrong said sen joseph r biden rdel who managed the 
democratic version of the bill on the senate floor 
what we are trying to do is to give shape to american 
policy biden said the only real issue is the level of 
commitment 
democrats said the bush administration may lose a historic 
opportunity to end the cold war and encourage the spread of 
democratic institutions and free enterprise throughout eastern 
europe and ultimately in the soviet union itself 
the debate comes after months of partisan squabbling about aid 
levels for eastern europe which some say is on the verge of 
peaceful change from communism to democracy 
under pressure to do more bush has little by little expanded 
his aid proposal to its current level of 451 million over three 
years 
the house last week voted for an 840 million package of grants 
and loans for the two countries the senate foreign relations 
committee had earlier urged adoption of a threeyear 12 billion 
aid plan 
senate democrats now seek passage of a proposal sponsored by 
sen paul simon dill to authorize a total 989 million in 
grants and loans over three years 
the simon bill includes 125 million in food aid 200 million 
in currency stabilization loans 200 million in trade credit 
insurance guarantees 40 million in environmental aid and 320 
million for poland and 80 million for hungary to promote 
development of private enterprise 
dole offered a substitute measure boosting the bush proposal by 
about 100 million to 585 million over the threeyear period and 
tying assistance to the development of a capitalist economy 
several democrats used the debate to renew a drumbeat of 
criticism against an administration they say is passively watching 
from the sidelines as history takes a momentous turn 
when asked for dramatic new steps the administration takes a 
wait and see attitude said sen patrick leahy dvt when 
asked for a solid commitment of aid it instead offers a few words 
of encouragement 
why is this administration so willing to commit billions for 
war but only small change for peace leahy asked

for the second time in five weeks a sailor 
stationed aboard the aircraft carrier uss midway has been convicted 
of espionage the navy said on wednesday 
navy spokesman lt james wood identified the second sailor who 
was sentenced to 10 years confinement at hard labor as electonics 
warfare technician petty officer third class russell p brown of 
norfolk neb 
brown 21 was convicted for conspiring with airman recruit 
james r wilmoth to commit espionage and for making false 
statements to the naval investigative service wood said 
wilmoth 21 of omaha neb was sentenced last month to 35 
years for trying to pass classified material to a soviet agent 
the sailors were arrested by nis on july 25 in yokosuka japan 
where the midway is based 
they were apprehended after an eightmonth investigation wood 
said 
no other sailors have been implicated in the case the 
spokesman said 
besides his 10year sentence brown received a dishonorable 
discharge reduction in rank from paygrade e3 to e1 and 
forfeiture of all pay and allowances wood said 
the navy spokesman said a general court martial was convened and 
charges against brown referred to a trial by a military judge at 
the order of the commander of the us seventh fleet vice adm 
henry h mauz jr 
the sailors twoday trial began oct 18 in yokosuka wood said 
the spokesman said brown pleaded not guilty and his case will be 
reviewed by the fleet commander before he begins serving his 
sentence 
wilmoth who worked in food service aboard the aircraft carrier 
also was convicted of possession and distribution of hashish navy 
spokesman lt greg smith said last month 
wood said wilmoth did not have a security clearance but that 
brown had one 
the spokesman said he could not provide any details of the 
classified information involved in the case 
asked about a report that brown took classified documents from a 
receptacle used to hold such documents slated for burning in the 
electronics warfare center of the carrier wood said he could not 
comment 
that is part of the investigation that is still going on 
wood said 
wilmoths court martial was in yokosuka as well and he was 
convicted on sept 24 on charges of attempted espionage failure to 
report a contact with a soviet citizen conspiracy to unlawfully 
transfer classified material and possession use and distribution 
of hashish 
wilmoth who also received a dishonorable discharge had been in 
the navy for 2 12 years and had served aboard the midway since may 
1988 smith said 
brown had been in the navy the same period of time as wilmoth 
and had been stationed aboard the aircraft carrier since may 1987 
wood said 
wood said it has not yet been determined where the men will 
serve out their sentences but that it would be in the united 
states 
the spokesman said that wilmoth had made a pretrial 
agreement with navy officials and that a reduced sentence had 
been discussed but that he could not comment on a report that 
the sailors term was reduced to 15 years in exchange for 
testifying against brown at his courtmartial 
browns mother said wednesday that her son and wilmoth didnt 
know each other before they enlisted in the navy 
yvonne brown of norfolk neb speaking through tears in a 
telephone interview with the omaha worldherald said she knows her 
son is innocent

son was in trouble when he called saturday night brown told his 
parents he wasnt guilty

im leaving man im leaving expletive you in trouble 
steven smith screamed as prosecutor james kindler crossexamined a 
defense psychiatrist who testified the suspect was too deranged to 
be prosecuted 
several jurors stared in surprise at smith who was standing at 
the defense table the defendant then said softly theres 
nothing i can do about it man im telling you straight out 
the turmoil was sparked when kindler asked dr daniel schwartz 
if smith could be faking insanity to receive lenient treatment 
state supreme court justice james leff then cleared the jury 
from the room and instructed smith he would tolerate no further 
outbursts which prompted another explosion from the defendant 
well what the expletive is that judge you want me to 
stop it i cant control it listen to me man im not normal 
man at all at all said smith thats what got me into 
trouble here now im here to get help brother 
smith was then handcuffed and led from the courtroom leff

hospitals for the past decade appears to have a psychosis related 
to schizophrenia 
defense lawyer marvyn kornberg admitted in opening remarks that 
smith committed the crimes charged but he argued that his client 
is insane and therefore not responsible for his actions

a decision will be made later this year on 
plans to move forward with a number of star wars experiments at 
kwajalein atoll in the marshall islands the army said on wednesday 
there are some 2900 us personnel at the armys missile test 
facility on the island 
army spokesman lt col dick bridges said the army has concluded 
an environmental impact statement on whether programs connected 
with the star wars program formally known as the strategic 
defense initiative would have a significant environmental affect 
on the atoll 
the army wants to provide test range facilities and support 
services on the island the pentagon said in a statement 
the proposed sdi tests at the us army kwajalein atoll 
include the sensing and tracking of reentry vehicles launched by 
missiles from california and hawaii the statement said 
such a segment of the spacebased antimissile system envisions 
rockets intercepting and destroying enemy missiles during the 
middle and latter stages of their flight 
in 1987 the pentagon ordered an extensive environmental impact 
statement after a preliminary report found that the acceleration 
of the star wars program would have no significant impact on any 
us facility with the exception of kwajalein 
at that time the pentagon said potential impacts include the 
possible degradation of water quality around the islands the 
possible degradation of the marine habitat and possible 
socioeconomic impacts as a result of population increases 
but after the latest study bridges said the army believes we 
can minimize any adverse affects on the environment if it goes 
through with its proposed actions on the atoll 
the army will not move forward with any action until a 30day 
period passes during which opponents of the action may file 
protests if they wish bridges said

tent cities that spread out in parks 
and vacant lots after the deadly oct 17 earthquake are unhealthy 
and dangerous firefighters and health officials said wednesday 
our plan is not to physically move people but to convince them 
that their options are better at other places fire chief gary 
smith said at a news conference wednesday in callaghan park where 
about 160 people have set up camp 
some of those living in the tent cities were driven from their 
homes because of damage but fright has kept many others outside 
even if inspectors have certified them sound 
still others refuse to move to red cross shelters because 
theyve gathered belongings into the tents things like sofas and 
televisions that arent allowed into the shelters 
but smith said there is concern that tent dwellers who are 
cooking on charcoal braziers could be taking them in the tents 
creating fire and health hazards 
central coast college student enrique alvarado one of the tent 
encampments organizers said he would try to persuade people to 
move but would let them decide for themselves 
many of the people living in the tent cities refuse to enter any 
building because they feel unsafe said patricia mendez a county 
employee 
about 1200 watsonville residents were displaced by the quake 
and aftershocks the quake killed dozens of people injured 
thousands and caused more than 71 billion damage throughout 
northern california watsonville a poor agricultural community 
just a few miles from the epicenter was especially hard it

former housing and urban development secretary 
samuel pierce on wednesday told congress he would again ban 
television cameras from his scheduled appearance before a house 
subcommittee his attorney hinted strongly that pierce would again 
refuse to testify 
pierce who has been subpoenaed to appear on friday invoked his 
right to ban television and radio coverage of the testimony during 
a meeting between his attorneys and the subcommittee staff 
meanwhile us district court judge joyce green denied a 
request by the four major television networks for a permanent 
injunction that would keep the clerk of the house from enforcing 
the rule permitting a witness to ban broadcast coverage 
the subcommittee on employment and housing of the government 
operations committee is investigating alleged fraud 
influencepeddling and mismanagement during pierces eightyear 
tenure last month he invoked his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination and refused to testify contending the 
subcommittee members had prejudged him 
in an interview wednesday night pierces attorney paul l 
perito said a decision on whether pierce would testify friday 
would not be made until thursday morning but he said he had seen 
little evidence that the subcommittees attitude toward the former 
secretary had changed 
i am still convinced that these people have prejudged my 
client without merit and we have certainly not foreclosed a 
continuation of the option we invoked at the previous hearing 
perito said 
stuart weisberg counsel for the subcommittee declined comment 
on the substance of the meeting except to confirm that pierces 
attorneys had renewed their request that television and still 
cameras and radio coverage be prohibited 
it was a cordial and frank discussion weisberg said 
another congressional source however said that pierces 
attorneys asked whether the subcommittee would require his presence 
in the event he would again refuse to testify and were told that 
subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif would insist that 
pierce personally appear 
another subcommittee member however said he thought it would 
be a waste of time to hold a hearing if pierce the only scheduled 
witness was not going to testify im not sure its worth us 
wasting our time to hear him tell us he wont testify said rep 
christopher shays rconn 
i dont think sam pierce could tell us very much anyway 
pierce appeared voluntarily before the panel in may and said he 
took no direct role in decisions about what projects to finance 
asking only that projects supported by prominent republicans 
receive careful consideration that appearance was covered live 
since then however a former pierce deputy and documents 
released by the agency have indicated that pierce played a greater 
role in some such decisions involving friends and political 
associates 
in addition to pierce three other former top hud officials 
including two who served as his top aides have refused to testify 
on grounds that their testimony might tend to incriminate them 
the judge dismissed the suit filed by cable news network inc 
capital citiesabc inc cbs inc and national broadcasting co 
inc 
the networks in alleging a violation of the first amendment 
contended that the house may not arbitrarily delegate to a private 
party the right to determine whether tv coverage of pierces 
appearances will be allowed 
green ruled however that judicial review of the question is 
barred by the constitution she said the house rule is within the 
legitimate legislative sphere and is essential to legislating 
the judge said the tv networks have chosen the wrong forum in 
which to present their objection their recourse lies not with the 
courts but rather with the coequal branch of government that 
enacted the rule

the senate approved legislation wednesday 
night boosting by 20 million the federal effort to lessen the 
hazards posed by earthquakes and to reduce the losses they cause 
the legislation sponsored by sen albert gore dtenn whose 
own state lies across an earthquake fault was adopted on voice 
vote without debate it now goes to the house 
it increases the authorization for earthquake hazard programs 
from the present 85 million to 105 million and expands the 
mission of agencies responsible for increasing earthquake 
preparedness 
for example the bill directs the preparation of model building 
codes to make structures more resistant to quakes and expands 
education and training programs 
it also directs the us geological survey to do further work on 
the exact location of fault lines and to establish a center for the 
international exchange of earthquake information 
of the additional 20 million authorization 8 million would be 
used for a study to determine why some buildings withstood last 
weeks earthquake in san francisco while others did not the 
remaining 12 million would be used for earthquake preparedness 
the actual 20 million is contained in the earthquake relief 
provisions of the stopgap appropriations bill sent to president 
bush by the house earlier wednesday under the rules of congress 
every appropriation must be accompanied by an authorization bill 
that sets a spending ceiling

members of the lac du flambeau 
chippewa tribe wednesday rejected a 356 million pact with the 
state to curtail the indians offreservation hunting and fishing 
outside the tribal hall a crowd of people protesting the 
agreement erupted in chants and screams of jubilation when told at 
925 pm of the outcome 439 votes against the plan and 366 for it 
the pact which many had expected to pass would have paid the 
tribe for not fishing for 10 years then been renegotiated some 
ceremonial fishing would still have been allowed 
i feel great said scott smith a lac du flambeau member 
they saved our rights 
before the vote about 30 to 40 opponents carried signs 
criticizing the agreement as a sellout of the tribes 19th 
century treaty rights and some heckled tribal government officials 
who walked by 
the treaty rights which courts have ruled allow indians to 
spearfish off their reservations have caused controversy and 
sparked some violence some sports fishermen are angered that the 
chippewa can fish with spears and out of season which other 
fishermen cannot do 
our ancestors thought enough to preserve our rights through 
this treaty and our council is selling it said dorothy thoms a 
tribal member who lives on the reservation in northwestern 
wisconsin 
tribal chairman mike allen ordered the tribal center secured by 
officers saying the action was due to numerous threats to 
disrupt the referendum election or take over the building 
allen said he received a death threat after he left a meeting on 
the reservation tuesday night 
they threatened me last night after the meeting and weve had 
numerous threats and calls allen said he said the death threat 
was made in person although he declined to identify the individual 
about 10 officers from tribal police the great lakes indian 
fish and wildlife commission and vilas county sheriffs department 
patrolled near the center 
ms thoms said the protesters were prepared to go to jail if 
tribal officials tried to quash their lastditch efforts ive 
got my medicine and my toothbrush in my purse she said 
the states six chippewa bands retain spearfishing hunting 
food gathering and timber cutting rights under courtaffirmed 19th 
century treaties that ceded northern wisconsin to the federal 
government 
the lac du flambeau with about 2500 members is traditionally 
the most active of the states chippewa bands during the 
spearfishing season 
in recent years opponents of the treaty rights have staged 
large and sometimes violent protests at lakes where the indians 
have spearfished last spring nearly 200 protesters were arrested 
the settlement with the lac du flambeau would have established a 
356 million trust fund from which individual tribal members would 
have been paid if it had been approved it would have advanced to 
the wisconsin legislature where it faced opposition 
before the vote allen said the plan would advance no further if 
it were defeated and the band is unlikely to continue negotiations 
with the state 
opponents had thought there was little hope the agreement would 
be voted down they said a plan to give each tribal member 1800 
in the first year of the agreement would probably ensure its 
passage 
the great spirit won over tonight said thomas maulson an 
organizer of the offreservation spearfishing the lac du 
flambeau people came through

after a week of closeddoor bargaining with 
the white house democratic sen robert c byrd stepped before 
television cameras to announce a compromise adding 11 billion to 
president bushs antidrug program 
his republican counterpart sen mark hatfield of oregon 
quickly cautioned that they still needed to make sure senate 
leaders would accept the deal 
i dont have to the courteous whitehaired byrd informed 
hatfield quietly but not so quietly that reporters couldnt hear 
he kinda left it up to me 
a year after he relinquished his powerful post as senate 
majority leader much of what happens in the senate still is up to 
the 71yearold sixth term democrat from west virginia 
when byrd believed lobbyists were getting out of hand the 
senate approved his bill restricting their activities it may well 
be the only ethics legislation enacted this year 
when bush proposed a drug initiative byrd considered 
inadequate byrd used his post as senate appropriations chairman to 
force negotiations with the white house on expanding the program 
and give democrats a legislative success on a highprofile bill 
as the senates senior democrat he also claimed the title of 
president pro tempore third in line to the presidency its been 
mostly a ceremonial post until now but byrd is overseeing a near 
doubling of its budget for staff and other support and 
strengthening his influence in the process 
he has been unabashedly funneling federal dollars into his 
povertystricken home state the 1990 military construction bill 
orders the pentagon to accelerate spending on west virginia 
projects to 49 million this year more than 10 times what the 
defense department proposed 
until byrd stepped down after six years as majority leader the 
senates top official had never before given up the job and 
remained in congress 
byrds decision reflected in part a dissatisfaction with his 
oldschool formal and sometimes quirky approach to the job 
procedure often seemed more important than policy 
in the wake of another presidential loss the democrats also 
wanted someone who could better counter the white house on 
television 
there was much speculation that byrd would simply take care of 
homestate concerns and attend to his cherished study of senate 
history 
but that is not his way 
whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might 
byrd says precisely quoting ecclesiastes 910 the king james 
version i have that sense of duty i follow it meticulously 
i think hes been freed by giving up the role of party 
leader says linda peek his former spokeswoman anybody who knew 
him knew that he wasnt going out to pasture she said 
byrd was known for seemingly endless meetings as majority 
leader hoping to enlist as many democrats as possible on any given 
issue he says he still tries to be fair but i dont have to 
concern myself with developing a consensus 
beyond his titles byrds influence permeates the institution 
hes called home since 1959 
many of the people he appointed when majority leader stayed 
behind to oversee a broad swath of the machinery that operates the 
senate 
in real estate alone byrd probably reigns over more of the 
senate wing of the capitol than anyone else with his two suites of 
offices and support staff rooms when majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine goes to work in the morning its in the robert 
c byrd rooms 
both byrd and mitchell say theres no friction between them 
although others point to some instances 
for example on the senate floor mitchell looked up from some 
work and asked byrd if he needed a vote on one of his bills a 
motion the leader would make byrd politely told him he already did 
it 
republicans note that byrds drug plan was developed almost 
entirely within the appropriations committee implying it was 
foisted upon mitchell the two democrats deny that too 
byrd brushes aside suggestions that personal clout is what gave 
his drug plan priority over those of others who sought to take on 
bush on the politically popular topic he just knows how to work 
the system and line up support he said 
one could not be expected to walk into the senate as a 
freshman and do that kind of work he said there has to be 
some knowledge of how this machine operates and some experience in 
dealing with other senators 
and ive had ample experience he says 
sen james sasser dtenn says what byrd has done so far is 
just the tip of the iceberg 
i think now he has the time and the position to focus his 
attention on creating legislation he said byrd is a powerful 
presence for his party sasser said who by force of personality 
is very intimidating to members on the other side of the aisle 
away from the spotlight byrd has been using his position as 
appropriations chairman to take care of the folks back home as his 
work on the military spending bill shows 
hes also made clear that he will represent west virginia 
interests without any help from intermediaries his antilobbying 
bill was a reaction against the hiring of consultants by west 
virginia university to seek a government grant 
but hes never far from the center of action 
north carolina republican jesse helms reacting to a federally 
supported exhibit including homosexual photographs was tying the 
senate into knots in his effort to prohibit spending by the federal 
arts agencies on anything that might be considered offensive 
but when helms tried to get the senate to pass an amendment 
instructing byrds committee against compromising with the house 
byrd put his foot down 
i am not going to follow the instructions of this amendment or 
any other amendment or resolution that might be introduced on this 
subject byrd declared the senate then tabled or killed the 
helms amendment 
a housesenate compromise emerged much watered down from what 
helms wanted which would establish a panel to oversee federal arts 
endowment policy 
a third of that panel will be appointed by the president a 
third by the speaker of the house and a third by the president pro 
tempore of the senate robert c byrd

junk bonds often get a bad rap from people who 
forget that on occasion such financing tools have helped new 
companies get started weak companies grow strong and small 
companies grow big 
but as happens eventually to everything in the world of 
creative finance the notion has been abused rather than financing 
sound enterprises junk bonds often became vehicles for the pursuit 
of greed power and fanciful schemes 
they have made certain individuals enormously and quickly 
wealthy they have put oncesound companies on the edge of 
financial disaster they have thwarted the growth of many 
companies and theyve all but destroyed others 
they have also shattered the dreams of many of those who bought 
them in expectation of big profits because now they must sit and 
wait and wonder if the companies in which they invested will ever 
be able to repay them 
default rates are rising and conceivably could mount into still 
another national financial disaster should a deep recession occur 
there are about 200 billion of them out there and they are 
widely held if a recession should occur it could ruin some 
overleveraged companies and destroy values in pension funds 
stocks mutual funds and college endowments 
short of a recession there still could be serious problems for 
holders the junk bond market isnt as liquid as other markets 
there is no assurance that buyers are out there at any given time 
given that prices could fall 
several large issuers of junk bonds already are in default 
among them dart drug stores and ltv while others are in deep 
trouble griffen resorts seaman furniture resorts international 
and integrated resources 
defaults and moratoriums total 4 billion this year the 
nations largest retailing empire campeau corp has come apart 
only a year after it was put together with junk financing other 
issuers survive by selling off parts 
the picture neednt be painted entirely in somber tones of gray 
however because some companies are bound to thrive continue to 
pay the high interest on their bonds and still have enough left in 
the kitty to finance growth 
growth is the secret by which issuers of junk bonds hope to cast 
off the burden of debt but that growth has to be vigorous within 
months some issuers have discovered that the growth they 
envisioned just wasnt there 
when that happens the company must think of cannibalizing 
itself or selling off parts to meet financial obligations but the 
consequence of that is often to further erode growth thus 
threatening a downward spiral 
prime computer inc a massachusetts computer maker that went 
from sales of about 85 million in 1978 to about 1 billion 10 
years later was acquired in a leveraged buyout earlier this year 
for 13 billion cash and junk bonds 
with its growth record its products its reputation and its 
ability to keep abreast of developments in its field prime 
appeared to be a safe risk a company capable of generating enough 
cash to keep bondholders happy 
this week the new owners of prime jh whitney amp co sought to 
slash costs by dismissing 2500 workers or 20 percent of primes 
payroll setting off speculation in the industry about the 
companys future 
if prime cannot support good workers how will it support good 
products can it service its customers gain new ones can it 
create new products to match the innovative equipment from its 
vigorous competitors 
conceivably prime could get its big bills paid down in four or 
five years and then turn its energies to growth and greater 
profitability but until then it will be carrying an interestrate 
burden thats like a deadweight anchor

tourists to amish country often return 
home with simple notions of the amish as merely quaintly dressed 
people who drive buggies 
their secluded ways have opened the amish for decades to such 
misconceptions and unchallenged commercial exploitation 
as an antidote a visitors center opened last year to offer 
tourists a selfguided lesson of amish and mennonite church history 
and culture 
perhaps surprisingly the center has become a learning place for 
amish children and even adults the founders had hoped this would 
happen but feared the secluded amish would shun the modern 
facility the more worldly mennonites have been strong supporters 
of the project since the beginning 
about half the amish children in this region go to public 
schools with the other half attending much smaller amish schools 
where one instructor teaches first through eighth grade 
neither the public nor the amish schools offer reliably thorough 
training in amish history said samuel yoder a former amishman who 
joined the mennonite church and now teaches at goshen college 
the result he said is that most amish children have only 
spotty knowledge of their cultural history of persecution in europe 
and the flight to religious freedom in the new world 
they know a few facts but not so much yoder said 
so in small but growing numbers amish are visiting the center 
to learn about their past 
they say that this is a good program and they have a real 
appreciation for the accuracies of it said dan beachy a guide 
at the center 
in the 17th century mennonite jakob amman split from the 
established church with his followers the amish over doctrinal 
matters both groups resisted the enforced teachings of the german 
statecontrolled church and state militarism and members found 
themselves persecuted for their beliefs 
they began emigrating to north america settling largely in 
pennsylvania ohio and indiana 
while the mennonites have become known for their international 
missions and disaster relief the old order amish have maintained 
their separateness from modern society they continue to wear plain 
clothing and speak a dialect of german they shun modern 
conveniences such as electrical appliances enginedpowered farm 
machinery and automobiles 
these amish ways caused their leadership to waver in its support 
for the visitors center 
initially before the design was finalized there was a fair 
amount of support from amish leadership said tim lichti a 
former mennonite preacher who directs the center once they 
discovered it was going to cost 1 million and have enough 
bathrooms for 10 people they began to wonder if our commitment 
to be noncommercial could be held 
the official stance was a waitandsee attitude since they 
have toured the facility they have become much more supportive 
still there is ambivalence and some resistance 
the center uses audio tape and visual aids modern devices 
disapproved by the amish to tell its story 
but they realize thats about the only way you get the story 
across yoder said 
nevertheless the reliance on tapes and slides puts amish 
leaders in an awkward position beachy said while they may approve 
of the centers mission openingly supporting it could be 
interpreted as an implicit endorsement of the modern devices he 
said 
individually they feel good about it but then to go out and 
promote it they go pretty lowkey on that he said 
only one or two groups of children from the areas allamish 
schools have been among the 67000 visitors who have toured the 
center since it opened last year most of the amish student 
visitors have come from public school groups lichti nevertheless 
expects a growing number of amish in the coming months 
in response to the growing amish acceptance of the center the 
board of directors is prepared to make a crucial modification in 
the asphalt parking lot yoder said 
were now talking about putting in hitching racks so that 
when they come in their buggies they can tie the horses

democrats have launched an autumn political 
offensive accusing president bush of timidity which is a 
slightly kinder way of saying wimp 
its a label bush confronted and overcame when he was a 
candidate now there is a toughening tone at the white house and 
from bushs republican allies in congress against the risk that 
democrats can revive the image as an issue by calling him a 
hesitant timid leader 
among other things the president is vowing to stand lobby and 
fight for a capital gains tax reduction something the leader of 
senate democrats says he will not get 
the house passed the tax measure as part of a budget bill but 
the senate stripped it away and differences between te two bills 
now are under negotiation the white house said bush will look for 
the first opportunity to push the issue to a vote in the senate 
where the administration claims it can get majority support in an 
up or down test bush is expected to contact as many as 20 senators 
in a personal lobbying drive for the tax cut he advocated as a 
candidate 
hes going to press for it and its not the greatest issue of 
our times but it sure as hell is a campaign promise that he kept 
and i think thats what people admire about him said sen alan 
k simpson of wyoming the republican whip 
another challenge to the democrats vice president dan quayle 
said bush may pick an issue and try to veto one item in a composite 
bill thus claiming a power of lineitem veto both he and ronald 
reagan have sought 
we are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test 
case said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
with that power bush could for example have vetoed only the 
abortion language in the appropriations bill he rejected last 
saturday because it provided federal funds for medicaid abortions 
in cases of rape or incest 
the idea of forcing a legal challenge and a court decision on 
whether a president already has the power to veto specific items is 
not new business it was discussed during the reagan years but 
never pushed to a test 
and nobody said it was going to happen this time but raising 
the prospect fits the strategy of counterattack drawing a line 
against the democrats running congress where the power to build 
hostage items into hardtoveto bills always has been guarded 
against administration inroads 
rep richard a gephardt of missouri the house majority leader 
sounded the democratic offensive 
the key to the current republican strategy has been to 
perpetuate a precarious status quo any great changes even those 
that might inure to americas benefit are avoided at all costs 
change is to be put off the status quo is to be preserved 
george bush appears to be determined to go down in history as 
the hesitation president gephardt said in a speech at the 
national press club a week ago at least his first year in office 
could be entitled the year of living timidly 
sen george mitchell of maine leader of the senates democratic 
majority already had accused bush of timidity in dealing with 
the opportunities opened by the move toward democracy in eastern 
europe 
the house has voted to approve nearly twice as much aid for 
poland and hungary as the administration proposed 
democratic leaders and more than a few republicans complained at 
administration inaction in the brief and futile panamanian coup 
against manuel noriega 
congress forced bush into an abortion veto that could hurt 
republicans the democrats outmaneuvered him on flagburning by 
passing a law he didnt want and rejecting a constitutional 
amendment he sought 
for the last three weeks as it becomes more and more obvious 
that the democratic leadership of the congress cant get their job 
done they have been attacking president bush more and more 
aggressively said rep newt gingrich the house republican whip 
for all of that the democrats have had trouble finding the 
voices and the themes to compete with the white house gephardt 
acknowledged the problem saying that congressional democrats must 
present a cohesive program not a batch of unconnected issues he 
said theyre still trying and hope to put together a consensus 
democratic agenda to be presented next year 
first congress and the president will have to settle the 
capital gains fight along with other major issues their rival 
child care programs a minimum wage bill to replace one bush vetoed 
as too high and might veto again because of his insistence on a 
lower training wage for new workers differences on how and how 
much to spend fighting drugs the stalled budget bill that has 
forced automatic if probably temporary spending cuts 
theres plenty there to test whos timid and who isnt

and who but julia child could get away with explaining yeast 
dough in terms of burps the main ingredients of flour are starch 
and gluten its the starch in the dough that feeds upon the yeast 
belching forth gas that pushes up the gluten 
child nurtures you through breadbaking explaining how yeast 
works what flour to buy what kneading is all about photographs 
make it clear just how the dough should look along the way 
and how can anyone resist trying a souffle when she writes 
the souffle is undoubtedly the egg at its most magnificent 
the egg in all its puffing power how impressive is the chocolate 
or cheese souffle its head rising dramatically out of its dish 
and swaying ever so slightly as it is borne to the table 
in a bow to health she includes cream soups made with 
pureed rice but she also suggests adding heavy or sour cream if 
you like she also offers a fatfree heavensent poached 
chicken and recommends a castiron grill to cook meat without fat 
but she writes i for one would rather swoon over a few thin 
slices of prime beefsteak or one small serving of chocolate 
mousee or a sliver of foie gras than indulge to the full on such 
nonentities as fatfree gelatin puddings 
child grew up in pasadena calif in a home with a hired cook 
and did not take a cooking lesson until she was in her 30s 
she graduated from smith college in 1934 and after writing 
advertising copy for a short time joined the office of strategic 
services the forerunner of the cia she was sent off as a clerk to 
ceylon now sri lanka where she met paul child a career diplomat 
10 years her senior in 1943 
they married in 1946 and remain very close she often talks in 
terms of we he recently moved to a nursing home near their 
cambridge mass home they have no children 
they just never came she said matteroffactly i would 
be very happy to be a grandmother at this point but in addition 
to her book child is busy these days working to improve the status 
of food professionals through the american institute of wine and 
food which she cofounded and the james beard foundation in new 
york 
two years after their marriage the childs were sent to paris 
where she enrolled at the cordon bleu cooking school she was 
considered a bit odd by her friends who all had hired help in the 
kitchen 
id been looking for my lifes work all along and when i got 
into cooking i found it i was inspired by the tremendous 
seriousness with which they took it 
in france she also met simone beck and louisette bertholle who 
needed an american collaborator for the first volume of mastering 
the art of french cooking nine years in the making it was 
published in 1961 with a foreword that began this is a book for 
the servantless american cook who can be unconcerned on occasion 
with budgets waistlines time schedules childrens meals the 
parentchauffeurden mother syndrome or anything else which might 
interfere with the enjoyment of producing something wonderful to 
eat 
and it ends above all have a good time 
two years later when child was 51 wgbh in boston launched 
the french chef series and for 206 meals she entertained and 
cajoled and encouraged viewers to do as she did 
i happened to be the right woman at the right time she said 
with modesty noting that john f kennedy had a french chef at the 
white house and more americans were traveling abroad 
suddenly people began considering food with a capital f 
besides she was fun to watch perhaps partly because of the 
onair disasters the first of which occurred with an apple 
charlotte 
as i was looking it did a slow collapse you could hear the 
tears in my voice to cover she told viewers you dont want 
it too stiff 
but the mistakes taught viewers how to make repairs and made 
her more familiar 
and since its the good company that counts her advice to 
others who make mistakes dont apologize ever its very bad to 
apologize because people will say that wasnt very good was it

it is americas most divisive social issue 
one that stirs the soberest reflections of private conscience the 
shrillest voices of public debate 
so polarizing are the arguments over abortion whether personal 
or political they can separate the warmest of lovers young adults 
from parents and grandparents priests from their parishioners 
officeholders from their jobs 
some women even some men are separated from their sanity 
suicide or years of melancholy are not unheard of either as the 
consequence of a lamented abortion or of a struggling mothers 
anguish over her inability to provide for a child perhaps woefully 
deformed or handicapped that she has brought into the world 
the ethical complexities wear thick for some americans thin for 
others some find their answers in faith some in science and some 
in lonely desperation at the heart of the furor is the question of 
whether human life begins with a babys first breath or nine 
months earlier with the microscopic conjunction of sperm and egg 
or somewhere in between with the emergence of a viable fetus 
at the fringe of that theological and scientific riddle are the 
ironies of fervor prolife fanatics for example who risk 
murder by bombing abortion clinics or militant mothers children 
proudly in tow marching for abortion rights 
each side claims the truth as its ally and thus they agree on 
precious few facts but there is little argument about this 
millions of american women about onefifth of those older than 15 
have had and will have abortions according to the alan 
guttmacher institute a birthcontrol research group in new york 
city 16 million abortions are performed annually nearly 
onethird of all pregnancies end in abortion 
the issue separates the president of the united states from the 
mainstream of public opinion from the congress and even from his 
personal physician burton j lee iii who believes each woman is 
entitled to decide for herself whether to bear a child 
it also separates president bush from the george bush of a 
decade ago before he got religion from ronald reagan in 1980 he 
opposed reagans idea of a constitutional amendment to overturn the 
supreme courts roe vs wade decision now against all political 
odds he supports such an amendment 
other conservatives arent waiting for a constitutional revision 
which to be realistic is nowhere on the political horizon 
instead reagans supreme court has itself begun chipping away at 
the roe decision the 1973 effort by justice harry blackmun to 
balance the governments interest in protecting life and a womans 
right to determine when and whether to have a child at least 
six states have new antiabortion laws ready to take hold pending 
a goahead from the court 
as a quiet battle rages within the justices chambers the 
skirmishes outside the door are deafening advocates on either side 
have marched by the tens of thousands upon the court congress 
state legislatures and even city halls they wave blueandwhite 
placards with blackandwhite aphorisms frequently more insult 
than idea it is a singleissue crusade neither side much concedes 
voters should judge anyone president or sheriff or dogcatcher by 
any other standard to one side you are either prolife or you 
condone or commit murder to the other you are either 
prochoice or you are willing to trample a womans rights and 
threaten her health or even life 
the roe decision entitled all women to have abortions for any 
reason within the first three months of pregnancy in upholding a 
restrictive missouri law last summer one declaring that life 
begins at conception the latest court reopened the door for a 
cornucopia of state efforts to legislate the issue 
george bush would allow only those women whose lives are 
threatened by pregnancy or those who are the victims of rape or 
incest to have abortions but he will not sign federal legislation 
to enable the poorest of sexually assaulted women to abort their 
fetuses at government expense in his view tax dollars should not 
be used to compound a violent act with the taking of an unborn 
life 
rep thomas c sawyer dohio bitterly summarized the 
presidents position this way he would give his daughter or 
yours or mine every option but if they cannot afford a 
doctor they must carry the unborn of that hateful act to term 
they have no choice 
sadly even the most destitute women do have an abortion choice 
of sorts it is essentially the same desperate option exercised 
by many young unmarried women back in the days when most states 
banned abortions and when unwed mothers faced ostracism and could 
be forced to turn their babies over for adoption for them an 
abortion meant squalid procedures sometimes selfadministered 
with knitting needles bleach and coathangers for some it meant 
death 
women will have abortions legal or not says molly yard 
president of the national organization for women the question is 
whether they will be legal medically safe and available to every 
woman who needs one 
the vast majority of abortions are performed within the first 12 
weeks of pregnancy at walkin clinics charging an average of only 
225 or so despite the modest cost many women appear to be 
resorting even now to amateur methods health officials in big 
cities are finding that some are intentionally using crack cocaine 
to induce uterine contractions others are trying megadoses of 
vitamin c exotic herbs and a menstrual extraction method using a 
mason jar aquarium tubing and other paraphernalia 
todays doityourself techniques can be as hazardous as the old 
coathanger abortions physicians say moreover they sometimes 
damage the fetus rather than kill it druginduced contractions can 
separate the placenta from the uterine wall causing oxygen 
deprivation and a braindamaged rather than aborted fetus 
cocaine can trigger a heart attack in the mother or cause the baby 
to be born a drug addict 
a woman who has plenty of money neednt worry about either her 
safety or legal risk no matter what course local jurisdictions 
take some states like new york california washington and 
hawaii seem certain to keep abortion legal for the indefinite 
future and there are always clinics to be found overseas in 
france for example a simple pill known as the ru486 can be 
used to end pregnancy within five weeks of conception 
but the travel alternative while easy enough for the career 
woman or affluent housewife with a pocketbook full of credit cards 
is out of the question for ghetto teenagers or welfare mothers 
already struggling to support a roomful of kids thus the abortion 
debate while usually couched in medical or theological terms has 
a number of troubling class and racial overtones 
according to the guttmacher institute women below the poverty 
level are more than three times as likely to have abortions as 
women whose incomes exceed 25000 an astonishing number about 
500000 a year are teenagers and because many lack access to 
medical care early in pregnancy they are more prone to seek 
abortions in later stages when more legal restrictions are now 
possible

the national securities commission has

lambert inc a newspaper reported 
madrids el mundo daily said tuesday the commissions directors 
recently approved a 70millionpeseta or 615000 fine against 
dbl capital markets espana sa for very serious civil 
infractions of trading rules 
the paper said the commission must receive government approval 
before issuing the fine which at five times the illicit profits 
earned represents the maximum penalty permitted under law 
a spokesman for new yorkbased drexel said theres been no 
official decision its still under consideration and obviously we 
cant comment 
but sources said they believed the fine would be lower and that 
a final decision was still some time away 
drexel which recently pleaded guilty to unrelated fraud charges 
in the united states and has pledged to toughen securities law 
compliance closed the 27employee spanish unit in july 
acknowledging improper behavior

fraudulently made 400 applications for shares worth 59 million in 
the april 20may 6 partial privatization of the statecontroled

of 123000

the federal government has been too slow to 
decide on proposals for stronger automobile safety standards says 
president bushs choice to head the national highway traffic safety 
administration 
jerry r curry a retired army major general and former deputy 
assistant defense secretary said at his senate confirmation 
hearing tuesday he would set a goal of 18 months for the agency to 
approve or reject new safety regulations 
one area where i have been disappointed is in the length of 
time it takes to complete a rulemaking action two years on the 
average from start to finish curry told the senate committee on 
commerce science and transportation which took no vote on his 
confirmation in some cases it has taken years longer he said 
but curry who has been a consultant to the agency since march 
said its career employees were doing their jobs well he backed the 
bush administrations opposition to pending legislation that would 
set time limits for rulemaking on some transportationsafety issues 
the national highway traffic safety administration charged with 
ensuring that vehicles meet minimum safety standards drew 
bipartisan accusations of laxity during the reagan administration 
it seemed to us in the past that oftentimes nhtsa has been 
most subservient to ideological positions which seemed to say 
why should safety stand in the way of profit sen john 
danforth rmo said 
committee chairman richard d bryan dnev described the 
agency in recent years as lethargic and some would say 
derelict 
senators closely questioned curry about whether he had any 
philosophical aversion to government intervention in the automobile 
industry to promote safety 
i bring nothing in the ideological nature to this job curry 
said to me ths job has a very narrow focus that focus is 
saving lives 
curry promised if confirmed to push the agency to conclude by 
next summer its decadelong consideration of an improved 
sideimpact standard for passenger cars senators cited the delay 
as the most flagrant example of what they called the agencys 
footdragging 
the agency began studying a sideimpact standard in 1979 but 
suspended action in 1982 only to renew its work last year 
danforth said an estimated 10000 americans are klled in 
sideimpact crashes each year he said 
curry also promised action by the end of 1990 on proposals to 
toughen standards for multipurpose vehicles such as small trucks 
and minivans for child booster seats for improving pedestrian 
safety and for reducing head injuries caused by bumping into 
interior components

a senate agriculture subcommittee chairman has 
accused the agriculture department of not sufficiently warning 
farmers about the dangers of fertilizers and pesticides to 
groundwater 
the departments extension service calculates that 46 percent 
of us counties contain groundwater susceptible to contamination 
from pesticides and fertilizers said sen wyche fowler dga 
chairman of the subcommittee on conservation and forestry 
he said tuesday that wells are not systematically tested 
research is not keeping up with the problem and national data on 
fertilizer and chemical damage to groundwater in each of the states 
is not available 
it should come as no surprise then that farmers have poor 
information on the consequences of the practices they employ 
beyond this years yield fowler said 
the us extension service which our farmers rely on for so 
much of their information has not taken adequate steps to educate 
them about the possible consequences of polluting our water 
supplies with pesticides and fertilizers he said 
furthermore he said the extension service is not providing 
much guidance to farmers about alternatives to chemical use 
during a hearing on water quality fowler said he had recently 
been informed that extension service agents were getting paid by 
chemical companies to be consultants 
jay vroom of the national agricultural chemical association 
said he had not heard of that happening but said that the chemical 
manufacturers have long relied on information from extension agents 
and land grant universities 
terry nipp director of the water quality initiative at the 
national association of state universities and land grant colleges 
said its widely known that fertilizer and pesticide dealers have a 
great deal of influence with how farmers use chemicals 
yet there is no national program to certify train or provide 
educational materials to the dealers nipp said in testimony to 
the fowlers subcommittee 
he said the extension services would like to do more but dont 
have the money or personnel 
fowler asked nipp why extension agents were criticizing the 
system known as low intensity sustainable agriculture which relies 
on organic procedures for increasing yields and controlling pests 
like all institutions there is a certain amount of inertia 
said nipp but he said there have been some fairly religious 
conversions by extension agents to organic methods 
fowler said he called the hearing to help determine what kind of 
regulations pertaining to groundwater should be in the 1990 farm 
bill 
we simply cannot continue to encourage farmers to maximize 
program benefits at the expense of the environment he said

a house committee has approved legislation 
requiring the federal trade commission to adopt new rules designed 
to stem multibilliondollar telephone sales fraud 
the house energy and commerce committee on a voice vote 
tuesday approved a bill by rep thomas a luken dohio that 
would order the ftc to establish a minimum set of standards on 
socalled telemarketing within 180 days 
the rules must give buyers the right to change their minds 
within a certain time after placing a phone order and require 
refunds if the goods arent delivered by a specified date 
the ftc also must establish restrictions on the time of day when 
phone solicitations may be made 
in addition the bill allows private citizens and state 
officials to sue in federal court anyone who violates the new ftc 
rules or commits telemarketing fraud prohibits harassment of 
customers by telemarketing firms and directs the commission to set 
up an office to answer consumer questions 
a nearly identical measure passed the house last year on a voice 
vote but died in the senate 
telephone fraud has grown widely in recent years as hustlers 
offer phony prizes or try to sell goods such as gemstones and rare 
coins or shoddy merchandise 
luken said the ftc had estimated there is 1 billion a year in 
telemarketing fraud private estimates have put the figure much 
higher luken added 
the telephone is becoming an instrument to reach out and rob 
someone luken said 
the bill was designed to make telemarketing rules conform with 
15yearold ftc restrictions on doortodoor and mailorder sales 
said benjamin cohen an aide to luken 
the commission earlier this month began formal proceedings to 
extend the mailorder regulations to telephone sales 
the bill had the support of the banking industry this year 
which has asserted it is losing several hundred million dollars a 
year when dissatisfied customers stop payment on visa or mastercard 
purchases made by phone cohen added 
before it approved the bill the committee gave voicevote 
approval to an amendment offered by rep thomas j manton dny 
that specifies that the new ftc rules will not apply to securities 
which are covered by the securities and exchange commission 
the sec two months ago adopted a penny stock rule requiring 
that the buyer must give the seller written confirmation before the 
sale is consummated 
thats tougher than anything in our bill cohen said 
in other action tuesday the committee on a voice vote 
authorized 1098 million for the federal communications commission 
in the 1990 fiscal year the year that began oct 1 and 1215 
million next year up from 996 million in the 1989 fiscal year 
the fcc authorization was amended by rep bill richardson 
dnm to allow the fcc to consider what impact its rulings may 
have on us trade 
richardson said the provision was a response to the decision 
last month of the european common market to urge its 12 member 
nations to broadcast television programs made in the market at 
least 51 percent of the time where practicable 
he said amendment was a strong signal that until foreign 
telecommunications markets are completely open to us companies 
the united states will be watching its own interests carefully 
the senate commerce science and transportation committee 
earlier this month authorized 1098 million for the fcc in 1990 
but only 1198 million for 1991 
the house committee also authorized 293 million for the 
commerce departments national telecommunications and information 
administration for 1990 and 1991

largely for american and european business travellers who until now 
have had to choose between the worn but welllocated hotels run by 
the soviet intourist travel agency and the usbuilt 
mezhdunarodnaya several miles from the city center 
the service and ambiance of the intourist hotels are the subject 
of frequent complaints from western travellers 
the sheraton moscow will employ about 650 people most of them 
soviets who will be trained in hotel services by westerners drawn 
from sheratons network of western european hotels said john 
kapioltas head of the ittsheraton corp 
the hotel to include an english pub and italian japanese and 
russian restaurants and a discoteque will accept western 
currencies rather than the soviet ruble which on the black market 
is worth about six times less than the conversion rate offered by 
stateowned banks 
the arrangement allows sheraton to finesse an aspect of soviet 
law that has hampered previous such joint ventures that western 
firms may repatriate only western currency and may not convert 
rubles into hard currencies for transfer outside the soviet union 
sheraton and the city of moscow each hold a 40 percent stake in 
the joint venture and pan am and aeroflot hold 10 percent apiece 
officials said 
neogotiations are still under way to determine the exact amount 
that each partner will invest in the construction said plaskett 
the soviets are expected to supply workmen and raw materials but 
sheraton will supervise construction and have the right to import 
skilled craftsmen as needed he said 
the hotel will be located on gorky street in a block currently 
occupied largely by residential units soviet officials said 
contractors will preserve the facade of the existing buildings 
and the street will be preserved to take into account the 
architectural character of the district one of most historic in 
moscow said moscow mayor valery t saikin

alfred a checchi who headed a group that 
acquired the parent of northwest airlines inc says the fear that 
debtfinanced airline takeovers sacrifice safety is misleading 
testifying before a house panel tuesday the los angeles 
investor said a wellmaintained fleet is in fact a far more 
costeffective fleet to operate 
his testimony came before a subcommittee of the house ways and 
means committee that is looking into the tax policy aspects of 
mergers acquisitions and leveraged buyouts in the airline industry 
earlier in the day senior transportation and treasury 
department officials told a house panel that proposed legislation 
to restrict airline takeovers wouldnt be good for the industry or 
the country 
checchi added that every deal is different and one 
acrosstheboard rule would be naive and shortsighted 
he said that the kind of person who would if he could cut 
back on maintenance procedures to save money would do this 
irrespective of what his companys capital structure might be 
rep jj pickle dtexas chairman of the oversight 
subcomittee said the panel was looking into whether tax 
provisions have made the airlines more desirable and more 
susceptible to takeover activity 
to combat that another subcommittee member rep byron l 
dorgan dnd introduced legislation that would prohibit airlines 
purchased in leveraged buyouts from deducting interest payments 
from their taxes 
last week a house committee voted to give the transportation 
department the authority to block a major airline takeover if it 
would jeopardize safety hinder the companys ability to compete or 
put it in the hands of a foreign carrier 
but a top transportation department official said the agency 
neither needs nor wants such authority 
patrick v murphy jr deputy assistant secretary of 
transportation for policy and international affairs said the 
department would object strongly to any legislation that might 
inappropriately interfere with the free flow of capital in the 
airline industry or with allowing the dynamics of the marketplace 
to determine the capital structure of airlines 
murphy said his boss transportation secretary samuel skinner 
has told congress that senior advisers will recommend to the 
president that he veto any such legislation 
another government official john g wilkins said the treasury 
department opposes any legislative attempt to single out and 
address concerns regarding leveraged buyouts in a specific 
industry 
the tax code is generally too blunt an instrument to draw 
distinctions between good and bad debt or between good and bad 
lbos said wilkins a senior economic adviser in the treasurys 
office of tax policy 
he added that his department does not favor special incometax 
rules for airlines or for any other specific industry 
in his testimony checchi said the 4 billion takeover of nwa 
inc the parent of northwest was not motivated by tax factors 
if the tax treatment of debt had been changed to make the 
aftertax cost of interest greater i do not necessarily feel that 
this would have discouraged the acquisition of northwest he 
said the fundamental attractiveness of northwest as a business 
would remain unchanged 
checchi also said that while klm royal dutch airlines was part 
of the group that bought nwa we ceded no control of northwest to 
klm 
he noted that klm got only 5 percent of the voting stock and one 
out of 12 seats on the board of directors 
each acquisition and acquirer should be evaluated 
individually he told the panel

a plunge and then a late rally in ual corp 
stock is keeping many eyes on the parent company of united 
airlines despite its boards insistence that it is backing away 
from an immediate sale 
in tuesdays trading on the new york stock exchange ual 
finished down 837 at 170 a share rallying on late buying 
interest after dropping more than 32 early in the day 
the closing price represented just over half the 300 a share 
originally offered by a buyout group that included uals management 
and pilots 
the united chapter of the air line pilots association said 
tuesday it was undaunted in its quest for an employeeowned airline 
alpa spokesman hank krakowski said the late rally in uals stock 
price might be a sign of possible takeover interest from outside 
we told our pilots tonight on the telephone hotline that we 
know from sources that someone is accumulating ual stock but who 
that is we do not know krakowski said 
the companys board said late monday the chicagobased airline 
would remain independent while directors examine alternatives to 
the 675 billion offer that collapsed earlier this month 
pat friend a spokeswoman for the association of flight 
attendants another union involved in the original buyout attempt 
said her union was not happy with the boards stand 
we dont know what anyones going to do at this point in 
time friend said all were saying is that we believe the 
board of directors have made a mistake because they have not taken 
any action to protect the company from hostile takeovers 
airline analyst stephen dexter with kemper financial services 
inc said the ual boards statement gives the pilotmanagement 
group breathing room to regroup and possibly come back with another 
buyout proposal 
all the messages here are lets take a breather stand back 
let management run the company its a holding pattern until a 
firm bid hits the table dexter said 
krakowski said the pilots continued to work behind the scenes in 
an attempt to put together another package 
the players the pilots their financial advisers havent 
packed up their bags and gone home by any means he said well 
just regroup and see what we can do in the future 
robert decker an airline analyst with the chicago investment 
firm duff amp phelps inc said the decline in uals stock is 
making any potential bid cheaper all the time its just a 
reaction to the boards decision to do nothing 
and the more the stock price falls the more attractive ual is 
to hostile raiders decker said 
stock prices declined broadly in heavy trading early tuesday in 
part due to concerns about ual though there was some recovery 
after noon the pilotmanagement groups announcement oct 13 that 
it was unable to obtain financing for its bid helped trigger a 
19058point drop in the dow jones industrial average and launched 
the downward slide for ual 
the widely followed market index finished down 369 tuesday at 
265922 after a day of volatile movement 
in addition to the inability to raise financing the buyout 
suffered another major setback last week when british airways plc 
which was to contribute 750 million in equity in exchange for a 15 
percent stake in ual pulled out of the buyout group

speculation that the hot pace of car and truck 
sales in late summer would cool is coming true with automakers 
reporting a 205 percent drop in vehicle sales in midoctober 
compared with the same period last year 
part of the analysts predictions of weak sales in october came 
from consumers fear of price increases for 1990model cars which 
were introduced this month and attractive buyer incentives in 
august and september 
the combination apparently proved too much to resist for some 
consumers who had planned to buy cars this fall car sales reported 
tuesday by the big three automakers fell more than 20 percent each 
with light truck sales not far behind 
the eight major automakers with us plants said they sold 
vehicles at an average daily rate of 28156 during oct 1120 
compared with a rate of 35407 during the same time last year 
overall car sales were off 19 percent while truck sales were down 
228 percent 
as the 1990 model year opened automakers announced price 
increases they blamed mostly on federal safety requirements 
including driverside air bags or automatic safety belts 
general motors corp announced a 34 percent average price 
increase for its 1990 model cars ford motor cos prices rose an 
average of 49 percent and chrysler corps went up 5 percent on 
average 
the manufacturers also carried over cash rebates or lowinterest 
financing packages to some 1990 cars and trucks but they didnt 
match the level of incentives on 1989 models 
some dealers still have 1989 cars and trucks in stock but the 
majority sold now are 1990 models 
the midoctober sales decline when tacked on to the 119 
percent drop in earlyoctober sales figures worked out to a 165 
percent decline in vehicle sales during the first 20 days of the 
month compared with the same period last year 
we borrowed some business from october november and 
december said herb adcox owner of herb adcox chevrolet in 
chattanooga tenn and the incoming treasurer of the national 
automobile dealers association that usually happens when you 
have a strong close to the model year like this 
in september car and light truck sales by the eight companies 
were up 82 percent over the same month last year in august 
vehicle sales were up 131 percent compared with august 1988 
so far this calendar year car and truck sales are running 2 
percent behind the last years pace the secondbest on record car 
sales are down 3 percent and lighttruck sales were down 02 
percent 
gm reported its car sales were down 248 percent during 
midoctober compared with last year while gms light truck sales 
were off 26 percent for the yeartodate gms car sales were down 
68 percent while truck sales were up 14 percent 
ford said its midoctober car sales ran 212 percent behind last 
year and truck sales were down 242 percent for the year fords 
car sales were 06 percent behind last year and truck sales were 
down 27 percent 
midoctober car sales at chrysler were down 237 percent and 
truck sales were off 175 percent since the first of the year 
chryslers car sales were 115 percent behind last year and truck 
sales were down 04 percent

ford motor co says its ready more than a year 
early to bid for all of jaguar plcs outstanding stock but that 
it may not go after the british luxury carmaker when the time comes 
ford apparently will have to wait until the end of next year 
before it could move to acquire more than 15 percent of the company 
because of an ownership roadblock written into jaguars bylaws 
a suitor can acquire more than 15 percent of the stock before 
then but it must be approved by jaguars board of directors and 
that seems unlikely in fords case 
the notification by ford on monday to the securities and 
exchange commission that it was prepared to bid for all of the 
stock stemmed from an sec requirement said ford spokeswoman lin 
cummins 
it is a legal requirement by the sec that once you became a 5 
percent stockholder in the company you have to disclose your 
intentions concerning the issuer which is jaguar she said 
its not saying that we are going after it 
ford and general motors corp have made separate moves to 
acquire chunks of jaguar ford through stock purchases that jaguar 
has called unwelcome and gm through friendly negotiations with 
company 
gm and ford the nations nos 1 and 2 automakers respectively 
apparently want a luxury automobile to add to their stables and 
jaguar which has fallen on tough financial times seems to fit the 
bill 
on the new york stock exchange ford stock fell 75 cents a share 
to close at 49125 tuesday and jaguars american depositary 
receipts rose 125 cents to close at 1125 in overthecounter 
trading 
on tuesday ford reported a 224 percent decline in sales of its 
cars and light trucks during midoctober compared with the same 
time last year jaguar like other overseas automakers wont 
report us sales until the first of next month 
because of jaguar bylaws no outside individual or company may 
acquire more than 15 percent of its stock before dec 31 1990 
without a vote by jaguars board of directors after that date 
there are no provisions in place that would thwart a hostile 
takeover through stock purchases 
jaguar has said it wants to remain independent 
ford announced sept 19 that it planned to acquire 15 percent of 
jaguars stock and received us regulatory approval for the 
purchase by monday jaguar said ford had accumulated 219 million 
shares or about 12 percent of the companys outstanding stock 
a ford move to acquire all of jaguars stock may be dealt a blow 
sooner than the end of next year 
jaguar chairman john egan has said he hopes to make an 
announcement to shareholders within a month about the matter 
spokesman tom mcdonnell of jaguars us subsidiary said tuesday 
it is possible that such an announcement would involve gm which 
reportedly has been negotiating to buy up to 30 percent of jaguar 
stock within the next few years 
we are continuing in our discussions with jaguar regarding 
several possible business arrangements including manufacturing 
marketing and other activities gm spokesman ron theis said 
tuesday he said egan said last week the discussions included a 
product for the european market 
we have declined to get any more specific than that theis 
said

nintendo of america inc will get a hand from 
pepsicola co in promoting its portable video game boy that 
analysts say could be one of the most popular presents under 
christmas trees this year 
but nintendo says the transistor radiosized handheld device 
has such blockbuster potential that the company wont have enough 
of them this christmas to meet even half of the projected demand 
we expect to sell out said bill white director of 
advertising and public relations for the us subsidiary of japans 
nintendo co ltd 
white said nintendo forecasts the holiday demand for game boy at 
2 million to 25 million units nintendo will ship just over 1 
million units and another 4 million to 5 million next year he 
said 
pepsi and nintendo announced tuesday they would team up in a 
twomonth promotion starting nov 1 during which pepsi will award 
more than 4000 game boys to consumers 
for pepsi the campaign could be a bonanza if it encourages many 
more consumers to buy pepsi beverages for a chance to obtain what 
could become a hardtofind holiday gift 
we hope to be in the forefront of consumers minds during the 
holidays pepsicola spokesman tod mackenzie said tuesday we 
hope to make the pepsi brand name synonymous with the hottest toy 
of the holiday season 
toy industry analysts agree that nintendo appears to have 
another big hit on its hands with game boy which retails for 
8995 nintendos entertainment system that turns a television 
into a game screen dominates the homecomputergame business 
angela bourdon spokeswoman for retailer toys r us said game 
boy has been a strong seller since its release in august 
its the no 1 best seller for christmas she said hands 
down 
kathy ellis a retail analyst with morgan stanley amp co in new 
york had a similar view the game boy is going to have a 
tremendous christmas she said 
added frank reysen editor of playthings magazine people are 
asking if this is the next cabbage patch referring to the dolls 
that were a toy industry sensation in the mid1980s 
reysen said he doubts game boy will achieve megahit status in 
the same league as the cabbage patch dolls with such a hefty 
pricetag game boy wont be for everyone 
but reysen said game boy could trigger a turnaround in the 
handheld video game category which has been in the doldrums for 
several years game boy uses interchangeable cartridges but not 
the same ones as used on nintendos regular tvbased system 
pepsis 10 million promotion with nintendo will be supported by 
radio and television advertisements plus instore 
pointofpurchase displays pepsi said it would create special tv 
and radio ads for network and local broadcasts 
customers will have a chance at winning a game boy or certain 
other items through an instantwin underthecap giveaway on 
specially marked packages of pepsi products the other prizes 
include nintendo action sets uforce remotes for use with the 
nintendo entertainment system nintendo game paks 5 nintendo 
vouchers and free coupons for twoliter pepsi products 
the contest will be featured on 16oz nonreturnable 
oneliter twoliter and threeliter packages of pepsi diet pepsi 
both diet and regular caffeine free pepsi moutain dew and 
lemonlime slice 
pepsi is hoping this years holiday promotion will have results 
similar to last years when pepsi sponsored the home video release 
of mcauniversals et the extraterrestrial and offered 
special 5 rebates 
according to pepsi the 1988 promotion generated a record 16 
million rebates and helped et become the highestselling home 
video in history

the dollar lost ground against the japanese yen in 
tokyo today and stock prices fell in afternoon trading erasing 
earlier gains 
the dollar finished trading at 14155 yen down 055 yen from 
tuesdays close of 14210 yen after opening at 14157 yen it 
stayed in a narrow range between 14140 and 14179 yen 
recently the us currency hasnt been falling much in tokyo 
because japanese investors still have large dollar demands said 
yuji nakao a trader with chemical bank in tokyo 
but he said traders in other countries had become less 
interested in the dollar because of recent declines in us 
interest rates 
lower interest rates in a country tend to make its currency less 
attractive to investors 
japanese participants also were concerned about recent losses on 
the new york stock exchange following its big plunge two weeks ago 
he said 
on the stock market the 225issue nikkei stock average shed 
8415 points or 024 percent ending the days trading at 
3544240 the index which lost 5897 points the previous day 
gained 7190 points in the morning but fell back in afternoon 
trading 
the index started falling as investors began selling issues to 
take profits from the morning gains dealers said 
many participants also stepped off to the sidelines to wait to 
see the performance of the new york market tonight said kazuhiro 
nomura a dealer with new japan securities co ltd 
the new york stock exchanges dow jones industrial average of 30 
major issues lost about 80 points on tuesday its largest tumble 
since oct 13 when it fell more than 190 points 
nomura said arbitrage deals by some participants to make profits 
from price gaps between the spot and futures markets also helped 
cause the nikkeis afternoon fall 
but he said there were no negative economic elements in the 
tokyo market discouraging participants

a pair of new twoseat 
roadsters and a new fourwheeldrive sedan and station wagon will 
lead mercedesbenzs fight to hold its share of the growing luxury 
car market a company executive says 
eric krampe president and chief executive officer of 
mercedesbenz of north america inc said tuesday he expected the 
luxury market to grow to about 840000 cars next year about 10000 
more than 1989 sales 
krampe also said he expected the company to keep or slightly 
increase its 75000carayear sales pace of 1989 the four cars 
that the west german automaker introduced will lead a list of 17 
models into the next decade 
the 300sl with a base price of 73500 and the 500sl which 
costs 10000 more replace the mercedes 560sl a roadster the west 
german automaker had been producing for 18 years 
mercedes also is selling a sedan and a station wagon carrying 
300e and 300te designations respectively with automatically 
engaging fourwheeldrive a first for the company 
some of the competition mercedes will face in 1990 will come 
from japan 
toyota motor corp last month began selling its lexus luxury 
cars and next month nissan motor corp will begin selling its 
infiniti line 
they will try to take customers from the united states 
automakers as well as europeans krampe said what the effect 
will be still has to be seen there is no clear picture yet 
we do view them with a lot of respect he said we believe 
they will be worthy competitors 
the median price for a mercedes in 1989 was about 45000 
krampe said slightly above the 40000 price for the 
topoftheline lexus or infiniti model krampe doubted speculation 
that the japanese companies were keeping their prices low in order 
to grab larger shares of the us luxurycar market 
they are certainly out with an interesting price he said 
i think it would be very disrespectful to say they buy market 
share im not happy that theyre around at these prices but i 
understand why 
krampe said he expected the two new sl models to account for 
about 8000 in sales apiece and the fourwheeldrive cars called 
4matic will account for about 1000 in sales each 
the fourwheeldrive system is a complex series of sensors that 
automatically add frontwheeldrive to existing rearwheeldrive 
when certain limits of wheel spin engine speed and other factors 
are passed drivers have to do nothing for the system to engage or 
disengage 
next year mercedes plans to introduce two new turbodiesel cars 
which should amount to about 4000 in sales in 1990 krampe 
acknowledged reports that the new turbodiesels do not meet 
stringent california air quality standards meaning that the state 
with some of the companys largest markets will be off limits for 
the diesel cars 
the rest of the country he said accounts for 75 percent of 
mercedes sales

japans minister of agriculture forestry and 
fisheries on wednesday opposed new us proposals for the 
liberalization of farm trade saying they were impractical 
michihiko kano told a parliament committee we believe there 
are some problems in the realization of the us proposals from a 
standpoint of the world agricultural situation and the position in 
which japanese farmers are being placed a parliamentary official 
said 
japan will maintain its current stand particularly its 
policy of selfsufficiency in rice the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity quoted kano as saying 
us trade representative carla hills and agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter announced in washington tuesday a fourpoint 
package calling for all farm trade import barriers to be turned 
into tariffs and gradually reduced over 10 years and for the 
abolishment of all export subsidies in five years 
under the proposals to be submitted wednesday to international 
farm trade liberalization talks in geneva japan would be able to 
protect its rice production with a high tariff at first but would 
have to gradually lower it to nearly zero in 10 years 
prime minister toshiki kaifu told the parliamentary committee 
the government would continue to implement a policy of 
selfsufficiency on rice 
japanese officials maintain that rice as a staple food should 
be protected and that japan should continue its policy for 
security reasons 
the japanese government regulates the domestic rice market 
buying much of the rice produced by japanese farmers and reselling 
it to consumers at lower prices which are still several times the 
world market level

statistics showing that black mortgage 
applicants are rejected twice as often as whites indicate federal 
regulators arent trying hard enough to enforce discrimination 
laws a senate banking subcommittee chairman says 
the problem today is not lack of laws it is lackluster 
enforcement said sen alan j dixon dill chairman of the 
consumer and regulatory affairs panel 
blacks applying for mortgages at savings institutions are 
rejected approximately twice as often as whites according to data 
collected since 1978 by the office of thrift supervision 
however robert j herrmann senior deputy at the office of the 
comptroller of the currency said only 16 of the 37000 written 
complaints received by his agency between january 1987 and august 
1989 alleged racial discrimination in mortgage lending 
all 16 were investigated and no violations were found he said 
studies by the federal reserve board show that predominantly 
black neighborhoods in atlanta boston cleveland and detroit 
received fewer home purchase loans than white neighborhoods with 
similar income levels 
im not a statistician but when blacks are getting their loan 
applications rejected twice as often as whites i conclude that 
discrimination is part of the problem dixon said tuesday 
regulators told his panel the data doesnt prove violations by 
financial institutions which are prohibited from discriminating 
against potential borrowers on the basis of race sex religion 
national origin or family status 
jonathan l fiechter senior deputy director of the thrift 
office said the statistics only suggest the possibility of 
unequal treatment because they dont include information on the 
income or credit worthiness of mortgage applicants 
john p laware a member of the federal reserve board said 
differences in lending to black and white neighborhoods could be 
explained in part by differences in demand for mortgages 
moreover regulators said their examinations find few banks not 
living up to their obligations 
john f bovenzi deputy to the chairman of the federal deposit 
insurance corp said only 21 of 6515 banks examined for redlining 
violations in 1986 1987 and 1988 received less than satisfactory 
ratings 
herrmann and laware said discrimination is often difficult to 
detect because it can occur when institutions subtly discourage 
loan applications from minorities when there are no applications 
there are no audit trails for examiners to follow they said 
allen j fishbein general counsel for the center for community 
change an activist group in washington said the department of 
housing and urban development could remedy that by expanding its 
use of testers 
testing is an investigative technique using matched pairs of 
homeseekers minority and nonminority who are otherwise 
similarly qualified financial institutions have resisted the use 
of that tactic even though it is already used to detect 
discrimination by real estate and rental agents

the new head of the securities and exchange 
commission told a congressional panel today the handling of wall 
streets 190 point plunge on oct 13 shows the value of the 
market improvements adopted during the past two years 
sec chairman richard c breeden who noted i was sworn into 
office just two weeks ago today was the star witness before a 
house panel on market reform his first public appearance since 
taking office 
it also was breedens first public questioning since the dow 
jones industrial average plunged 19058 points on oct 13 
the dow jones average a key market indicator rebounded to 
close up 8812 points the following monday after a week of gentler 
fluctuations it seesawed again tuesday finishing the day with a 
slight decline of 369 points at 265922 
we learned important lessons from the market turbulence of 
oct 13 and oct 16 and the markets responses to it breeden 
said in testimony prepared for the house energy and commerce 
committees telecommunications and finance subcommittee 
the volume surges and volatility experienced on those two days 
exemplify fundamental changes in our markets they were not 
isolated instances we should not panic in the face of these 
events however for what was demonstrated on oct 13 and 16 was 
the strength and resiliency of the nations markets 
he noted that more shares were traded in one hour during the 
oct 13 slide than were traded on the average full day in 1985 
and three times the markets average daily volume 10 years ago 
breeden also said communication among the financial markets was 
excellent and circuitbreakers temporary trading halts in options 
to slow market volatility also worked well 
legislation is pending in both the senate and the house that 
would expand the secs powers to monitor the markets in several 
ways some of them opposed by various segments of the industry and 
one giving the sec the power to halt trading in emergencies 
opposed by breeden himself 
the other proposed changes include giving the sec authority to 
request reports on large securities and options trades this power 
would enhance the secs surveillence abilities to track whos 
trading what to whom another would require rules for assessing the 
financial soundness of holding companies that are the parent 
companies of brokerdealers 
the other witnesses slated to testify are edward i obrien 
president of the securities industry association a trade 
association representing 600 securities firms and george s 
bissell chairman of the bostonbased keystone group of mutual 
funds 
the market reforms proposed by congress include giving the sec 
chairman the authority to halt trading for up to 24 hours in 
emergenies currently only the president can order such a shutdown 
but breeden has said he does not want that power and does not 
think it should be exercised 
in written answers to senate staffers questions during 
confirmation hearings for the sec post breeden said such authority 
would create too much uncertainty about when the markets would 
close and for how long 
in a crisis this uncertainty and the related rumors 
concerning its likelihood could have seriously adverse 
consequences he wrote last month

wall street took on a calmer tone today 
following tuesdays rollercoaster ride in which stock prices swung 
wildly depressing the dollar and boosting demand for us treasury 
bonds 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was off 635 to 265287 
in the first half hour of trading today but in the broader market 
rising stocks held a small edge over losers 
the dow average plummeted as much as 85 points on tuesday before 
rebounding and closing down 369 points at 265922 
analysts said the tone for tuesdays market gyrations was set by 
two factors speculation that a collapsed deal to buy united 
airlines parent ual corp signaled a continued ebbing of the 
takeover tide and concern that a slowing economy would lead to 
weaker corporate profits 
on wall street program trading strategies involving millions of 
shares of stock helped accentuate wild declines and rebounds in 
stock prices some analysts said 
it was almost all computerized program trading that gave us 
tremendous violent price swings said dennis e jarrett a 
technical analyst for kidder peabody amp co i dont think you 
could put your finger on any underlying economic statistic 
in other financial markets tuesday the dollar ended lower 
against most major currencies moving in tandem with the stock 
market and reflecting concern from foreign investors about the 
shakiness of the us financial markets 
but us treasury bonds posted moderate gains with the 
bellwether 30year bond up point or 5 per 1000 face amount 
treasury bonds which are guaranteed by the government are 
considered a safe haven at times of financial instability 
stock market observers initially attributed the downturn to the 
decision late monday by ual to forego an employeemanagement buyout 
for the time being and a surge tuesday in computerized program 
selling involving stockindex futures 
in such program selling traders using sophisticated computer 
programs take advantage of minute price discrepancies between 
stockindex futures and the actual stocks on which the futures 
contracts are based 
the ual buyout groups oct 13 announcement that it couldnt 
raise financing for its 675 billion bid and program selling that 
followed were considered key factors in the dows 190point plunge 
that day stocks regained much of their losses last week however 
its certainly reminiscent of friday the 13th although 
its not a replay said hugh johnson chief investment officer 
for first albany corp in albany 
analysts said program trades dominated tuesdays buying and 
selling 
i didnt see a lot of individuals or even institutions 
participating said johnson by and large they seemed to be 
fence sitting 
gene jay seagle vice president and director of technical 
research at gruntal financial inc said program trading was 
accelerating the current bearishness apparent in the stock market 
what we have here is an intermediate correction in an 
otherwise bull market he said but weve just seen it happen 
in a matter of days instead of weeks as we normally do 
were getting compressed moves both on the upside and the 
downside due to program trading 
johnson said the fixation on the collapse of the ual buyout 
represented concerns about the future of leveraged buyouts 
its not the final nail in the coffin of leveraged buyouts or 
acquisitions but its pretty darn close to it he said the 
lbo business had been the principal drive of the stock market for 
most of 1988 and 1989 
analysts also pinned the blame on the lower stock prices on 
weakness in the economy and its effects on corporate profits those 
concerns were magnified by a government report tuesday showing that 
orders for big ticket durable goods declined 01 percent during 
september 
the economys heartbeat is not very strong and that isnt good 
news for stocks said ac moore director of research at argus 
research in new york

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
today he opposes a bill that would subject the central bank to more 
supervision from congress and the administration 
however congressional supporters of the measure said it was 
needed to make the secretive central bank more accountable for its 
actions which can have enormous impact on the 5 trillion us 
economy 
the federal reserve must take actions that while sometimes 
unpopular in the short run are in the longrun best interests of 
the country greenspan said adding that the independence of 
the federal reserve has in practice served the country well 
greenspan was the leadoff witness as a house banking 
subcommittee opened hearings to examine how the central bank and 
its chairman often called the second most powerful man in america 
reach decisions on setting interest rates 
greenspan said the fed was opposed to a bill sponsored by reps 
lee hamilton dind and byron dorgan dnd which would require 
fed officials to meet at specified times with the administration 
and release immediately results of its closeddoor deliberations 
while rejecting these proposals greenspan did endorse another 
measure sponsored by rep stephen neal dnc that would write 
into law that the feds chief mission is to eliminate inflation and 
establish a deadline of 1994 for having done so 
greenspan said however that wringing inflation out of the 
economy over the next five years would have shorttem costs in 
terms of slower growth 
the hamiltondorgan proposal also calls for the feds budget 
which currently is not reviewed by either congress or the 
administration to be subject to review and would require that the 
feds books be audited each year by congressional auditors it also 
would make the chairmans term start one year after the start of a 
presidential term 
greenspan said all those changes would compromise the political 
independence of the fed which he said was essential to the central 
banks main role of fighting inflation 
in arguing for his proposal hamilton said the purpose of our 
bill is to increase the accountability of the federal reserve to 
the american people by making the workings of the fed more open and 
by establishing a formal channel of communications between 
policymakers 
the hamiltondorgan measure originally called for the secretary 
of the treasury to be added to the feds key policymaking body 
the federal open market committee 
that panel composed of members of the federal reserve board and 
presidents of the feds regional banks meets secretly eight times 
a year to set interest rate policies decisions arent made public 
for six weeks after a meeting and even then only abbreviated 
minutes of the closeddoor sessions are made available 
the revised hamiltondorgan bill drops the effort to put the 
treasury secretary on the feds policy board and instead calls for 
the fed panel to meet twice each year with the treasury secretary 
and other top administration officials it also calls for the 
immediate release of the minutes of the meeting 
neals measure does not include any penalties if the fed fails 
to meet the fiveyear deadline for eliminating inflation 
consumer prices have been rising at an annual rate of 44 
percent through the first nine months of this year 
current law directs the fed to promote effectively the goals 
of maximum employment stable prices and moderate longterm 
interest rates but says nothing about the tradeoffs between 
these sometimesconflicting goals 
the law as it is presently written is so broad that the fed 
can do anything and say that they are following the law neal 
said in arguing for his proposal 
neals original legislation was much more specific in calling on 
the fed to reduce by 1 percent a year until it had reached zero 
inflation 
his new version revamped to meet greenspans objections simply 
calls for the elimination of inflation in five years and 
paraphrases language greenspan has used to say that inflation 
will be deemed to be eliminated when the expected rate of change of 
the general level of prices ceases to be a factor in individual and 
business decisions making 
even the revised bills are given little chance of passing 
congress especially in light of objections from key members of the 
senate banking committee

the state bank announced today that it was 
dramatically devaluing the ruble for people and businesses needing 
convertible currency to travel abroad 
the new rate of 626 rubles to the dollar is a tacit admission 
that the ruble is not worth anything near the existing official 
rate of 6277 per dollar 
it means that soviet travelers instead of receiving 159 per 
ruble will instead get about 16 cents 
the announcement reported by the official tass news agency 
indicated the standard rate will remain in effect for most 
transactions such as for foreign firms doing business in the 
soviet union and for most international trade with the west 
the special rate will be used by banking institutions in the 
ussr when selling hard currencies to citizens traveling 
abroad on personal matters and when purchasing such currencies 
tass said 
it will also be used when selling hard currencies to 
state cooperative and other public and other enterprises for 
business trips of their workers abroad 
one western diplomatic analyst speaking on condition he not be 
identified said the announcement could mark an initial step 
toward eventual convertibility of the ruble on international 
currency exchanges but the source called it too small a step to 
have any obvious effect on the soviet unions foreign trade status 
because the ruble cannot be freely exchanged for dollars yen 
marks and other hard currencies it has virtually no value outside 
the soviet union 
soviet citizens have long been allowed to exchange just 200 
rubles for travel abroad tens of thousands of soviets making trips 
to the west thus trade rubles for dollars on the black market and 
smuggle cash out of the country 
a tremendous increase in the number of soviets being permitted 
to travel abroad under the more open climate created by president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms has been blamed by western observers 
for a sharp decline in the blackmarket value of the ruble 
a spokesman for the council of ministers which approved the 
measure characterized the change as an attempt to attract more 
foreign tourists curb the black market and encourage soviet 
citizens with hardcurrency bank accounts to exchange them for 
rubles thus increasing the state banks hardcurrency reserves 
the announcement did not indicate foreign tourists would be 
allowed to buy rubles at the new rate so it was not clear how the 
move could affect foreign tourism 
the spokesman valery ovcharenko of the council of ministers 
press office told the associated press the new rule would take 
effect nov 1 
the new rate if accompanied by a lifting of the limit on 
official exchanges would give soviet travelers a more attractive 
legal alternative than the black market for buying hard currency 
the growing disparity between the official rate and blackmarket 
rates tends to feed anxieties about the nations tenuous economic 
condition 
tass gave no explanation for the devaluation and igor 
kozlovsky deputy chief of the joint currency economics department 
of the finance ministry refused to give more details on the 
decision he would say only that it had been approved by the 
council of ministers 
the council of foreign ministers in december ordered up a plan 
for partial convertibility of the ruble beginning with a 50 
percent devaluation on jan 1 1990 
making the ruble convertible would destroy the soviet pricing 
system under which industrial goods and raw materials are cheap 
and consumer goods are expensive

cineplex odeon corp chairman garth drabinsky is 
planning a bid worth 6668 million to buy his company the firm 
said today 
drabinsky and his longtime partner myron gottlieb are trying 
to arrange financing for a 14 per share cash offer cineplex said 
cineplexs biggest shareholder los angelesbased entertainment 
giant mca inc has agreed to sell its stake worth 330 million 
under the proposed bid if drabinsky can arrange financing and 
mail the offer by nov 22 cineplex said in a statement 
the other big shareholder claridge inc of montreal led by 
charles bronfman has also agreed to tender its 947 million stake 
under the same conditions cineplex said 
cineplex owns more than 1800 screens in about 500 locations in 
north america drabinsky founded the chain a decade ago 
a special committee of the cineplex board would continue to meet 
with other interested bidders until the drabinsky offer is firm 
company spokesman brian hemming said 
cineplex stock was down 37 cents to 1087 a share in early 
new york stock exchange trading today 
drabinskys proposed bid is less than the nearly 15 a share he 
originally offered to buy out the claridge stake and gain control 
of the company piecemeal several months ago 
mca had objected to that move and regulators quickly quashed the 
bid saying drabinsky was required to make the same offer to all 
shareholders 
under their agreement with drabinsky mca and claridge retain 
the right to pull out of any deal with him and tender their shares 
to a higher competing bid cineplex said 
the cineplex statement also said mca and claridge have agreed to 
buy the universal city 18screen complex in los angeles and lease 
the facility back to cineplex if the drabinsky bid goes through 
cineplex also said it would sell its 51 percent stake in film 
house to jointowner rank organization plc of britain

as a 22yearold exchange student heinz prechter 
decided to stay in the united states to pursue an auto sunroof 
business 
his decision grew into the asc inc car conversion empire and 
at age 47 prechter is spending weeks at a time at a new asc 
facility back in his native west germany 
the man who left boyhood in rural bavaria to chase the american 
dream now has a foothold for expansion in the european economic 
community of 1992 and beyond 
we are a company with truly worldwide activities for a small 
company like ours thats unusual he said 
prechter who became a naturalized us citizen in 1972 has 
built a reputation in detroit economic development circles and a 
role in republican politics that includes advising the president on 
international competitiveness 
he said he realized early that stability for asc would depend on 
international marketing in japan and in europe a recession in 
detroit earlier this decade punctuated the lesson 
between jet trips to west germany prechter recently led a 
visitor through a chromedecorated studio at ascs southgate 
headquarters 
getting his hands on the cars still makes him smile and he 
showed how the convertible top drops into concealment on a gold 
specialedition ford mustang 
also gleaming under the lights were audi porsche acura toyota 
convertibles made by asc and a bright yellow softtop jeep 
raised in rural postwar west germany i grew up as a farm boy 
and of course there were no cars prechter said 
he left home at 13 to work as an apprentice in his uncles auto 
coachbuilding shop in nuremburg attending high school at night 
he went on to engineering school and traveled to the united states 
in 1963 to attend san francisco state university as an exchange 
student in engineering 
in 1965 he quit school but decided to stay in the united 
states he moved to los angeles and opened american sunroof co 
with 750 worth of tools in a twocar garage rented from custom car 
designer george barris 
prechter began selling handcut handformed metal sunroofs new 
to the united states at the time a visiting ford motor co 
executive asked him to do prototype work for ford and prechter 
soon moved his business to michigan 
asc inc now has about 30 facilities and employs about 3000 
people crafting special editions convertibles and prototypes for 
the big three us carmakers and overseas makers including toyota 
porsche and saab 
the newest plant in heilbrun west germany does the 
convertible conversion of the porsche 944 cabriolet prechter also 
owns an interest in karosserie werke in weinsberg which does 
advanced bodywork for makers such as bmw porsche ford 
volkswagen opel and fiat 
in the industrial area south of detroit prechter is dubbed the 
duke of downriver because of his holdings

calling it toxic waste dumping and the 
second opium war antismoking crusaders in asia have accused 
american tobacco interests of moving to reverse victories scored 
against the cigarette by targeting the booming pacific rim as a key 
market 
the american companies faced with antismoking regulations that 
depress profits in the united states say the budding antismoking 
movement in asia is an excuse for trade protectionism 
american cigarettes entered the once closed markets of south 
korea japan and taiwan in 1986 and now tobacco companies are 
trying to penetrate thailand american cigarettes historically have 
been hot sellers in hong kong 
asian smoking opponents claim the american hard sell and slick 
ads equating smoking with the good life will create a new 
generation of smoking addicts especially women and teenagers 
smoking foreign cigarettes has become a symbol of money and 
social status the china pictorial magazine stated recently 
noting the price of a couple of cartons of marlboros equal a 
chinese professors monthly salary 
in taiwan an antismoking group called john tungs foundation 
claims smoking has soared among teenagers because of hardsell 
tactics by american tobacco companies eightfive percent of 
youthful puffers prefer imports the tung group says 
in a letter to president bush earlier this year health groups 
from nine asian countries described the american push as a 
mockery of your countrys efforts to curb the export of other 
addictive drugs into your country 
activists have likened the american blitz to last centurys 
opium war when britain forcefully flooded china with opium from its 
colony india and made addicts out of millions 
those favoring increased exports such as congressman robin 
tallon of south carolina a major tobaccogrowing state contend 
asians will continue to buy cigarettes with or without american 
presence 
the real issue is whether american companies will be allowed 
to compete or if the playing field is abandoned to other foreign 
manufacturers and local monopolies he said 
the us cigarette export association notes as part of its 
argument that cigarettes contributed a record 35 billion to help 
reduce the us trade deficit in 1988 
the us trade office is threatening thailand with trade 
penalties if it does not lower its import tax and other barriers to 
american cigarettes it is seeking the reversal of laws under which 
cigarette advertising was sharply restricted in 1979 and virtually 
eliminated from mass media this year 
thai antismoking lobbyists some of whom recently testified in 
washington say their stand against american cigarettes is not a 
smokescreen for protectionism 
my bottom line is antismoking i dont care if its thai or 
american cigarettes said dr prakit vateesatokit of the thai 
antismoking campaign project i see people die of smoking every 
day 
prakit said he is concerned that a fullscale american entry 
will target youth and women in a smoking profile typical of many 
asian nations only 35 percent of thai women were said to smoke in 
1988 vs 466 percent of males 
led by 250 million chinese asians remain among the worlds most 
prolific puffers and account for 44 percent of global cigarette 
production governments take in hefty revenues from state 
monopolies and cigarette import taxes and thus are reluctant to 
take too tough a stand against their domestic industries 
but private pressure groups and governments in some asian 
countries inspired partly by the american antismoking movement 
have made some notable gains in the tobacco war 
led by prime minister mahathir mohamad a doctor turned 
politician malaysia banned smoking in government offices in 1982 
and all hospitals this year cigarette advertisements on television 
and radio both government controlled have been replaced by 
messages about smokings harmful effects 
but the asianpacific conference on cigarette smoking and 
health which sent the letter to bush said american cigarette 
promoters in malaysia still place television ads for such things as 
kent travel bags and tours of marlboro country in which 
viewers are asked to call a local travel agency if they wish to 
visit marlboro country 
prakit says the number of thai smokers has fallen sharply since 
1976 partly because of an increased awareness of the health risks 
the country beat the united states in forbidding smoking on all 
domestic airline flights a regulation that took effect this year 
antismoking campaigners got to prime minister chatichai 
choonhavan who gave up his trademark cigars recently hes joked 
that his sex life has since improved 
other asian leaders have set examples singapores lee kuan yew 
abhors smoking in his presence and philippines president corazon 
aquino has banned it at cabinet meetings 
those who light up on singapores buses trains and taxis face 
fines of up to 250 but in the philippines the macho marlboro man 
still rides tall as television audiences are bombarded with this 
and other american cigarette ads long banned in the united states 
hong kong where american smokes dominate 70 percent of market 
cigarette advertising is banned on prime time tv and will be banned 
from all programming by 1990 controversy continues in the british 
colony and elsewhere in asia over tobacco industry sponsorships of 
sports and cultural programs 
antismoking has made little headway in japan and china and only 
some in south korea where critics say american cigarettes are the 
most heavily advertised products in the country although the market 
share of imported cigarettes is still only about 4 percent 
in china where relatively expensive american cigarettes have 
captured only a miniscule percentage of the market the government 
has not even imposed health warnings on packs top leader deng 
xiaoping is a prolific smoker and is often photographed puffing on 
a domestic panda brand 
one flicker of interest was beijings participation in the first 
world antismoking day last april stalls in the city sold 
antismoking ointments quit smoking mouth gargles and 
battery powered electrodes attached to the cheeks and activated 
each time the user gets an urge to smoke 
in japan where more than 60 percent of the people smoke among 
the few places where smokers cannot indulge are underground 
platforms of tokyos subway system the sides of cigarette packs 
carry the faintly printed admonition be careful not to smoke too 
much for your health 
japan remains one of the few industrialized nations to allow 
cigarette advertising on tv where popular foreign actors such as 
james coburn and roger moore promote smokings glamorous image 
the american incursion does not appear to have significantly 
affected smoking in japan but the asianpacific conference claimed 
that since the market was opened to americans in 1987 cigarette 
ads on tokyo television rose from no 40 to second place in total 
air time 
japanese companies the conference reported have responded to 
steppedup competition by copying westernstyle advertising and 
concocting new products these include a womenoriented brand 
misty and another called dean named after deceased 
american actor james dean an idol among japanese youth

the aim was admirable scratch extraneous 
words from a tonguetwisting trade code 
but by deleting three a government agency has mistakenly opened 
the nations borders to cheap brooms and us makers of a witchs 
favorite ride fear their sturdy cornbristle sweepers may never 
stroke another dirty floor 
its thrown our industry into turmoil says tim monahan of 
arcola ill president of thomas monahan co the worlds largest 
supplier of cornbroom materials weve seen them gearing up 
heavily in mexico 
its absolutely unbelievable adds bill libman who runs an 
illinois cornbroom company founded by his grandfather in 1896 
the industry which includes approximately 50 major producers 
making at least 20 million corn brooms a year from whisk to floor 
models says its been dusted by the us international trade 
commission 
in an effort to simplify language the commission changed the 
section that put import restrictions and costly tariffs on brooms 
made wholly or partly of broom corn 
the rules now apply only to brooms made of broom corn 
the change got little attention until the customs service was 
recently asked to interpret the new code is a broom that is 28 
percent to 43 percent corn bristle subject to the governments 
import limit 
the customs service said no 
and with that green light foreign producers now can stuff their 
brooms with cheap material such as grass or vegetable fibers ship 
them to the united states and market them as dependable corn brooms 
even though they are not the real thing monahan said wednesday 
libman said his company makes more than 1 million brooms a year 
at prices ranging from 6 to 8 
foreign brooms are selling for less than half he said 
its not a good product it lasts for a month and you throw it 
out the consumer doesnt know the difference 
were just a small industry monahan said we cant afford 
to educate the public 
a washington attorney who represents mexican broom exporters 
said the american makers just dont want competition 
its just hysteria attorney leslie a glick said 
dismissing claims that his clients make inferior brooms my 
clients call them naturalfiber brooms the mexican industry isnt 
that big 
a trade commission official acknowledged the mistake in a oct 
13 letter to the customs service which enforces tariff policy 
there was no intention on the commissions part to change the 
tariff treatment of whisk brooms and other brooms containing broom 
corn david b beck wrote 
the consequences this would have on the tariff treatment of 
these products were never brought to our attention when we 
could have done something about it he said 
so we understand that your hands are somewhat tied in 
interpreting the essential character of these products beck 
wrote 
some angry members of congress are pledging to rescue us 
cornbroom makers 
rep terry bruce dill whose district includes arcola 
introduced a bill tuesday to correct the error sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas the chairman of the taxwriting senate finance committee 
is pushing similar legislation 
ironically the cornbroom rule and other code changes were 
approved by congress

oil minister golamreza aqazadeh predicted 
wednesday that world oil demand would grow so strongly in the next 
two years that opec would abandon its current system of production 
limits 
in a news conference with foreign reporters aqazadeh also said 
iran would seek compensation for the destruction of offshore oil 
platforms by us forces near the end of the gulf war 
aqazadeh did not give any specific growth rate predictions for 
world oil demand but contended it would increase substantially 
over the next two years 
we anticipate this demand will reach such a level that the 
opec quota system will be abandoned altogether aqazadeh said 
as a result all members will be able to produce as much as 
necessary to meet demand and the opec quota system will be 
abandoned 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries now attempts 
to support a price of 18 a barrel for its crude oil through a 
system of voluntary production limits or quotas imposed on each 
of its 13 members 
prices have hovered somewhat below that level partly because 
overproduction by some member nations has pushed opecs output 
above the official ceiling of 205 million barrels a day 
asked how prices would be set once the quota system was 
abolished aqazadeh said there will be a longterm production and 
price strategy and by controlling production opec will be able to 
control price 
some very serious discussion over longterm strategy is taking 
place among opec members aqazadeh said he gave no details on 
how longterm production would be controlled without quotas 
william veno director of oil market analysis for data resources 
inc in boston said demand in noncommunist nations grew by 23 
percent about 12 million barrels a day in the first three 
quarters of 1989 for total daily consumption of 512 million 
barrels 
opecs average production during that time was 21 million 
barrels a day he said 
data resources projects that worldwide demand growth will slow 
to 13 percent in 1990 and about 12 percent annually in the next 
three years 
aqazadeh also said iran intends to seek compensation from the 
united states for destroying iranian offshore oil platforms during 
the gulf war 
he did not say how much the compensation should be but said 
total damage to his countrys offshore oil installations during the 
eightyear war was 15 billion most of the damage resulted from 
iraqi air raids 
us warships in the persian gulf attacked a number of iranian 
oil platforms which iranian forces used as bases for attacks on 
neutral shipping 
aqazadeh said irans main oil loading platform on kharg island 
which was raided repeatedly by iranian jets sustained 300 million 
worth of damage 
he said iran planned to invest 84 billion in hard currency on 
petrochemical expansion projects over the next five years if 
spending in local currency is included total investment in such 
projects could reach two to three times that amount he said 
aqazadeh said iran now earns 12 billion annually from oil and 
expects to earn 70 billion over the next five years the current 
earnings were based on a daily production of about 3 million 
barrels per day some 2 million barrels of which are exported 
aqazadeh said current production capacity was 35 million 
barrels a day but it was not fully used to conform to irans 
production quota of 292 million barrels a day set by opec 
he said expansion and reconstruction would increase capacity to 
4 million barrels a day within three years compared with prewar 
capacity of 6 million barrels 
aqazadeh said irans current total refining capacity is 730000 
barrels per day

a burly bearded man uses sign language to 
communicate with his pal as they belly up to the bar in a beer 
advertisement 
an ad for laundry detergent shows a man in a wheelchair 
skyhooking a soap packet into the washing machine an ad for a 
southern bank shows a mother getting her children off to school and 
settling down to read her bank statement written in braille 
advertisers have been making greater use of people with 
disabilities in mainstream commercials designed to show the wide 
appeal of their products and services 
advocates for the more than 37 million physically challenged 
americans have welcomed this increased visibility but they say the 
disabled still are underrepresented 
advertisers have been a bit timid said arney rosenblat 
spokeswoman for the national multiple sclerosis society and an 
advocate of more disabled people in advertising they always try 
to get sexy girls and project a mainstream idea of what everyone 
wants to look like using their product 
but she said a growing awareness of the economic clout of the 
disabled and pressure on congress to forbid discrimination against 
the disabled are having an impact 
she said the disabled have an estimated 40 billion a year in 
spending power an appealing target for manufacturers who have 
shown keener interest in getting messages to narrowly defined 
audiences 
five years ago you couldnt name one company using disabled 
people in commercials but now there are 10 or more ms 
rosenblat said 
they include anheuserbusch companies inc colgatepalmolive 
co wachovia bank amp trust co ralston purina co apple computer 
inc citicorp nike inc and general motors corp 
athletes in wheelchairs have been popular including a nike 
commercial that featured racer craig blanchette 
but advocates for the disabled say they are even more encouraged 
by ads that integrate average people with disabilities into 
reallife vignettes 
ralston for instance showed a blind man and his guide dog in a 
recent commercial for purina dog chow citicorp cast a businessman 
in a wheelchair with a briefcase on his lap in an ad that showed 
people hurrying to work and a dayton department stores ad included 
a boy in a wheelchair among a halfdozen youngsters trimming a 
christmas tree 
levi strauss amp co the apparel maker from san francisco was 
among the first to integrate disabled people into general 
advertising 
in 1984 levi used a man in a wheelchair as one of several 
people shown in a commercial for levis 501 blues and has used a 
woman in a wheelchair a hearingimpaired woman using sign language 
and an amputee on crutches 
we have never used them deliberately except when it seemed 
appropriate for the situation said alan jewett an executive at 
the levi ad agency foote cone amp belding 
fastfood leader mcdonalds corp has made prominent use of the 
disabled 
its captioned silent persuasion ad a few years ago showed 
two deaf students using sign language on a study break another ad 
called best friends showed a typical day for two junior high 
girls one in a wheelchair 
our view is that since a large percentage of our commercials 
deal with slice of life situations you dont ignore people who 
are a large part of society said chuck ebeling spokesman for 
the oak brook illbased company 
in an ad for budweiser that ended an 18month run late last 
year anheuserbusch showed a dozen scenes of friends enjoying a 
beer a group of graduates in their gowns some aging veterans at 
a reunion a father and son on a porch 
in one shot of a crowded bar a bearded man can be seen using 
sign language as he talks with a pal standing beside him 
great catch the admakers said the deaf man tells his friend 
as they watch television want another bud 
colgatepalmolive admakers cast a man in a wheelchair for a fab 
one shot commercial that ran last year the commercial showed 
people tossing the detergent packet into the washing machine from 
odd angles to the tune sweet georgia brown 
ariel allen vice president of creative services at colgate 
said she previously had received letters encouraging her to use the 
disabled in ads and felt it would be appropriate for this 
commercial 
the man selected for the ad played in a basketball league for 
the disabled she said and he provided something extra that 
happens from both a human and a selling point of view 
wachovia bank amp trust co of winstonsalem nc has been 
running ads for months that draw attention to its services the 
bank has been printing bank statements in braille for blind 
customers since the 1970s but had not advertised it until earlier 
this year 
the commercial shows a woman at her door as her children leave 
for school she turns back into the house and takes some papers off 
a table but it is only when she is seated and scanning the papers 
that viewers see they include a statement written in braille which 
the woman reads by passing her fingers over the raised dots she is 
blind 
advocates for the disabled say they want to see more disabled 
people make up 15 percent of the population but far fewer in ads 
laura slutsky founder of peoplefinders inc a new yorkbased 
agency that specializes in finding nonprofessional talent for 
commercials said none of the 50 or so advertisers she works for 
have asked for disabled people although she expects that to change 
jerry saviola director of casting services at grey advertising 
in new york said advertising agency people may simply not be 
sensitive enough to the whole situation to request disabled 
people for roles 
sometimes even when a disabled person is required for in a 
commercial admakers can stumble 
bill demby the vietnam vet who lost both legs in the war and 
starred in a commercial that showed him playing basketball with 
artificial legs made by dupont co said he almost backed out of 
the commercial 
he said one person involved in making the ad indicated he would 
manipulate a camera to make it appear demby could jump much higher 
than he actually could 
in a telephone interview from his home near washington demby 
said the comment upset him because he didnt want to mislead 
anybody about what artificial legs could do for an amputee 
but they assured me they would try to keep a reign on the 
offending admaker demby said and he made the ad 
he said hes happy with the result and thinks it reflects well 
on both the disabled and veterans the only difference between 
disabled people and others are what we use as transportation he 
said

futures prices of corn and soybeans shot higher 
but wheat prices sagged at the close of trading wednesday on the 
chicago board of trade 
this weeks light trading continued for a third day with little 
outside news of any consequence affecting prices said susan 
leighty an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
lack of export demand and beneficial rains for both the south 
american and us winter crop was hurting wheat prices ms leighty 
said 
supporting futures prices was new soviet interest in the 
agricultural markets as the soviet union purchased 50000 metric 
tons of argentine meal and 350000 metric tons of corn from 
yugoslavia since tuesday said victor lespinasse a floor trader 
with dean witter reynolds inc 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 5 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 403 a bushel corn was 1 
cent to 2 cents higher with december at 242 a bushel oats 
were cent to 1 cents lower with december at 145 a bushel 
and soybeans were 2 cents to 5 cents higher with november at

the united states on wednesday confronted 16 allies 
pressing to ease controls on sensitive high technology sales to 
communist governments in light of rapid changes in the soviet bloc 
a us source who spoke on condition of anonymity acknowledged 
before the meeting that washington was all but isolated by allies 
who want greater trade with fewer restrictions 
at the same time the source said the us delegation feels 
that some countries including west germany and italy have not 
strengthened export controls as promised 
the meeting of cocom the coordinating committee for 
multilateral export controls was expected to end thursday until 
then not even its location was to be disclosed 
cocom comprised of the 15 nato nations and japan and australia 
regulates trade in items to soviet bloc nations 
the us embassy said three issues would dominate the agenda 
streamlining the list of restricted items improving export 
controls and discussing political developments in the east 
cocoms list of restricted items threatens to drive a wedge 
between the united states and its european allies 
us officials contend that in a new atmosphere of openness 
soviet engineers are acquiring restricted western technology at 
what may be an unprecedented rate 
european governments insist the bush administration is dragging 
its feet reviewing the list itembyitem and retaining simple 
items that reached moscow long ago 
they argue that changing philosophies in eastern europe put 
political and economic pressure on them to expand trade 
increasingly cocom partners accuse the united states of using 
the list to stifle foreign competitors of american manufacturers 
they say that some us companies are also guilty of infractions 
recent us intelligence findings report that more than 5000 
machine tools have been sold illegally to the soviet union over the 
past five years the kremlin depends on western highprecision gear 
for manufacturing military equipment 
before the meeting wednesday reginald bartholomew us 
undersecretary of state for security assistance visited rome to 
warn that olivetti might be banned from selling some items in the 
united states 
the italian manufacturer was alleged to have exported to the 
soviet union machine tools used for making fighter aircraft 
engines olivetti also was reported to have sent technicians to the 
soviet union 
in a wellpublicized case last year japans toshiba machine co 
was accused of selling sophisticated equipment to the soviet union 
in violation of cocom regulations 
the united states claimed the equipment helped the soviets build 
quieter harder to detect submarines and it slapped severe 
sanctions on toshiba machine and prohibited it from exporting to 
the united states for three years 
on wednesday another japanese firm tomei shoji was convicted 
of exporting electronic products to communist north korea in 
violation of cocom rules the trading firm and one if its employees 
were fined a total of 4900 two other employees were given 
sixmonth prison terms 
specialists say part of the problem is the political role of 
export industries in national economies 
earlier this year defense department officials showed the 
associated press an internal report identifying west germany as 
the greatest single source of transfers of sensitive technology 
to the east 
the report blamed pressure from german business on a government 
eager for links to east germany and the soviet union 
even france regarded as a relatively effective cocom partner 
has allowed serious leaks 
earlier this year french officials said they were investigating 
the apparent role of a government adviser in illegal sales to 
moscow of machine tools used in making warplanes

mobil corps plan to trim its us exploration 
and production business reflects an industrywide trend toward 
bolstering their shrinking reserves by boosting overseas 
exploration analysts said wednesday 
mobils announcement on tuesday followed similar restructurings 
earlier this year by other major oil companies including texaco 
inc amoco corp and occidental petroleum corp 
mobil the nations secondlargest oil company after exxon 
corp said in its thirdquarter earnings report that it had taken 
a 40 million provision for the restructuring costs 
the oil giant said it planned to transfer and terminate 
employees over a twoyear period to reduce costs and focus 
efforts in areas where the projected financial returns are most 
attractive 
details of the reorganization were not immediately available 
but mobil spokesman john lord said an announcement was planned for 
friday 
mobil has been selling off a great number of small properties 
since the early 1980s lord said this restructuring is part 
of that 
analysts familiar with mobils strategy said the announcement 
was not a surprise given the general industry trend to cut us 
drilling costs and focus exploration overseas where the 
probability of finding large reserves is greater and financial 
exposure is lower due partly to more favorable tax and royalty 
rates 
were going to see more and more announcements by other 
majors said paul ting analyst with the investment firm 
oppenheimer amp co 
low crude oil prices over the last few years and heavy 
exploration costs in the united states have discouraged many 
companies from pumping more money into domestic oil drilling 
crude prices have hovered in the 18 to 20 a barrel range in 
recent months and as low as the 12 range last year 
more importantly analysts say the us oil patch may be nearly 
bone dry with little oil left outside of the gulf of mexico 
alaska and offshore california the last major us oil find was in 
the late 1960s in prudhoe bay alaska 
industrywide domestic production fell by more than 500000 
barrels a day during the first nine months of this year compared 
with a decline of about 200000 barrels a day during 1988 
basically the us has been drilled over for oil the large 
deposits are in geologically hostile areas or off limits due to 
environmental concerns said philip j kehl an analyst with dean 
witter reynolds inc 
most oil companies including large independents are 
reshuffling assets abroad because of declining us output kehl 
said 
areas outside the us are considered a more costeffective 
use of oil drilling funds he said 
in 1986 mobil announced a major restructuring of its upstream 
operations exploration and production as part of an 
industrywide shakeout due to plummeting oil prices 
last march texaco announced the reorganization of its us 
upstream operations into two regions as part of an overall 
restructuring to increase the companys profits worldwide the move 
included the streamlining of regional and divisional offices and 
trimming of management 
amoco followed with an announcement in late march that it was 
cutting its us exploration and production workforce by 800 amoco 
said at the time that its domestic operations would continue to 
shrink through divestment of marginal and nonstrategic properties 
while international activities would grow 
occidental continued the trend in recent weeks with the 
announcement that it had ceased all us exploration and was 
expanding its drilling overseas

wall street was stunned bond brokers froze 
doomsayers talked of financial disaster 
that was the scene a year ago as the biggest takeover battle of 
all time consumed rjr nabisco inc when it was over the investment 
firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co had defeated the food and 
tobacco giants top management paid a record 2453 billion in 
borrowed money and put the company heavily into debt 
critics of the 1980s takeover era said rjr nabisco would be 
crushed by the weight of its debt load and jeopardize the banks 
that financed the deal the bond market already reeling from a 
rash of highpriced takeovers was traumatized because investors 
thought the buyout binge had gone too far 
what a difference a year makes 
despite a debt of 23 billion rjr nabisco now is seen as a 
relative rock of stability while the financial markets are buffeted 
with uncertainty raised by smaller takeovers 
i think the company is doing tremendously well said kurt 
feuerman a securities analayst at drexel burnham lambert inc 
jack maxwell of wheat first securities in richmond va said 
its a good company and theyve got a good team 
investors also praise the new rjr nabisco confidence in the 
company was evident in the recent performance of the companys 
highyield junk bonds that were used to finance the takeover 
prices skidded on the highyieother big buyouts ran 
into trouble recently rjr nabiscos didnt 
there are two reasons why 
because of the nature of rjr nabiscos business the company is 
considered inherently more stable than other companies investors 
also have confidence in its management 
the biggest worry for highly leveragedld market after companies like 
rjr 
nabisco is cash flow without a strong steady influx of money 
they cant pay their interest bills 
several buyouts have stumbled because cash flow hasnt matched 
projections the most notorious case has been campeau corps 66 
billion takeover of federated department stores inc a wobbly 
transaction that jolted the stock and bond markets a few weeks ago 
because campeau couldnt pay its interest 
kohlberg kravis the acknowledged leader plan to shed any major divisions 
gerstner 
said in an interview 
individual product lines are the most likely to go gerstner 
said the butterfingers and baby ruth candy bar business is under 
consideration but he declined to name any other possible 
candidates 
maxwell the wheat first analyst said he was pleased by cost 
and inventory reductions and by the companys plans for boosting 
tobacco sales in recent years rj reynolds has turned around its 
oncelagging camel brand and is focusing on revitalizing winston 
and salem sales maxwell said 
the battle for rjr nabisco marked a quantum leap in the scope of 
the takeover trend reshaping american business for the first time 
it seemed to raise the possibility that any company could be 
acquired with borrowed money 
the company announced on oct 20 that its chief executive f 
ross johnson was considering a bid of about 17 billion 
that kind of money was beyond comprehension on wall street but 
four days later kohlberg kravis announced a 2025 billion offer 
signaling the start of a bidding war that for a while included the 
investment firm first boston corp 
the rjr nabisco fight not only dwarfed all records for 
takeovers it came against a background of brawls for two other big 
food companies 
just days before philip morris had launched an 11 billion 
offer for kraft inc and pillsbury co had rejected a 523 billion 
bid from the british firm grand metropolitan plc 
in both cases the suitors won and late in the evening of nov 
29 rjr nabisco announced that kohlberg kravis had emerged the 
winner 
johnson was vanquished but still rich from a severance package 
and the sale of his own rjr nabisco stock when he resigned in early 
february he took several top rjr nabisco managers with him but 
analysts said they were satisfied with gerstners replacements 
kohlberg kravis is also said to be happy with rjr nabiscos 
performance the investment firm is smarting from seamans problems 
and reports that it has been disappointed by other investments and 
its reputation rests on the outcome of its biggest takeover 
for gerstner the outside worlds obsession with the size of the 
takeover is irrelevant its running the business thats most 
important 
youve got to separate that financial transaction from the 
great marketing strength and production strength of this company 
he said

anheuserbusch companies inc said wednesday 
its thirdquarter profit rose 52 percent from a year ago on a 
revenue increase of 61 percent but warned that price cutting 
could slow future earnings growth 
the company which is the worlds largest brewer and also makes 
snack foods said earnings for the quarter ended sept 30 were 238 
million or 83 cents per share up from 226 million or 78 cents 
per share last year 
sales in the quarter rose to 270 billion from 255 billion in 
1988 
the company said it sold a record 214 million barrels of beer 
in the quarter up 42 percent from a year ago 
for the first nine months of the year the company said its beer 
sales accounted for 419 percent of the industrys sales up from 
406 percent as year earlier 
but august a busch iii chairman and president said 
anheuserbusch is being challenged by competitors who have begun to 
heavily discount their premium brands 
we have been very reluctant to discount our high quality 
premium brands to the same extent as our competitors busch said 
but he said some discounting is required to avoid further losses in 
sales volume 
busch said the financial impact of the price cuts will be lower 
earnings growth than anticipated for the last half of 1989 and the 
year 1990 but he said the move should eventually pay off in an 
even stronger market position and in higher earnings 
for the first nine months the company earned 639 million or 
223 per share up 82 percent from 5904 million or 201 per 
share a year earlier 
ninemonth sales of 73 billion in the first three quarters of 
last year 
the company recently agreed to purchase four sea world parks 
two other theme parks and certain land near the parks from harcourt 
brace jovanovich inc for 11 billion the deal is expected to be 
closed in november anheuserbusch said

a late bid for gold at 36850 an ounce off 20 cents 
currency dealers said the dollar got an early lift from comments 
from federal reserve chairman alan greenspan but edged lower mainly 
on technical factors they said many dealers were awaiting 
thursdays release of thirdquarter gross national product data 
which should shed more light on the direction of the economy and 
interest rates 
in testimony before congress greenspan hinted that the central 
bank was unlikely to ease credit by lowering interest rates any 
time soon because the current inflation rate of 44 percent was too 
high to be ignored

they make dollardenominated securities more attractive to 
foreigners thereby increasing the need for those investors to 
convert their money into the us currency

on a drizzly morning when traffic was snarled by 
an overturned nail truck seattle residents on wednesday learned 
their fastgrowing home had been named the nations best place to 
live for the second time this year 
the 1989 edition of the places rated almanac picked seattle tops 
among 333 cities in terms of climate transit crime education 
health care environment jobs arts and recreation 
while seattle struggles with explosive growth schools that 
dont seem to live up to expectations and the pervasive problems of 
drugs and crime attorney margaret pageler sees a special brand of 
optimism in the city 
what i love about seattle is the optimism of seattle people 
about our future she said theres that sort of progressive 
spirit of optimism perhaps its whats left of the western cando 
spirit thats still here 
others who take a less spiritual view might cite mount rainiers 
glacial peak the ferries plying puget sound fresh salmon and 
dungeness crabs stacked in the public market or ski slopes amid 
forests of douglas fir 
runnerup on the almanacs list was san francisco followed by 
pittsburgh washington and its marylandvirginia suburbs san 
diego boston new york anaheimsanta ana calif louisville 
ky and new yorks long island 
the lowest ranking went to pine bluff ark where chamber of 
commerce president jim berry tried to put a better spin on the

international business machines corp dedicated 
a 500 million computer chip laboratory wednesday and said it would 
share its research on xray etching with another us chipmaker 
motorola corp 
ibm spokesman paul bergevin said the advanced semiconductor 
technology center in east fishkill ny was the nations most 
advanced semiconductor development laboratory and on a par with any 
anywhere in the world 
the upstate new york laboratory will eventually house the 
nations first privately owned machine for etching computer chips 
with xrays ibm said 
ibm scientists are already experimenting with xray etching at 
brookhaven national laboratory in upton ny motorola will pay an 
undisclosed amount of money to send its engineers to brookhaven to 
participate in the ibm research for 21 months 
the xray work at brookhaven will be transferred to the new 
laboratory in east fishkill in 1991 at which time the investment 
in the laboratory will total about 500 million bergevin said 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher attended wednesdays 
dedication ceremonies along with robert noyce of sematech and 
sanford kane of us memories inc the two organizations are 
intended to bolster americas standing in computer chips 
bergevin said ibm was discussing sharing its xray etching 
research with other us companies out of an interest in 
strengthening the overall us semiconductor industry 
scientists say future generations of computer chips will be so 
densely packed with circuitry that regular light will be too fuzzy 
to etch the circuit lines xrays have shorter wavelengths so they 
can draw finer lines 
japanese companies are working intensively in xray etching 
bergevin said were certainly on a par with the very best 
efforts of the japanese 
the east fishkill laboratory will consolidate semiconductor 
research now done at chipmaking plants in east fishkill and essex 
junction vt and at ibm research headquarters in yorktown 
heights ny

when ames department stores inc decided to 
bring zayre stores into the corporate fold there were doubts that 
the discounter had selected an acquisition that would fit in easily 
or enhance its operations 
a year later ames is putting the finishing touches on what it 
calls the single largest us retail conversion ever on thursday 
254 former zayre stores will open their doors under the ames name 
the 12month process has turned ames into a dominant discounter 
in the northeast and the fourthbiggest discount retailer in the 
country with expected sales this year of 5 billion the three 
leading discounters are k mart corp walmart stores inc and the 
target stores division of dayton hudson corp 
peter b hollis ames president and chief executive officer 
said integrating zayres has demonstrated ames ability to handle 
change a necessary skill for mass merchants to have in a business 
where prosperity depends on being able to adapt to shifting 
consumer tastes and shopping habits 
retailers who fail to change will fall by the wayside 
hollis said in an interview 
ames had considerable experience with acquisitions before it 
bought zayre corps discount store division in october 1988 for 
778 million about 500 of ames 693 stores in 20 states and 
washington were the products of acquisitions ames has doubled its 
size twice in the past 4 years 
we are a company that are accustomed to acquisition and we 
are accustomed to change said hollis 
retail analysts say zayre posed a tough challenge for ames 
at the time ames came on the scene zayre stores in some areas 
were suffering from a reputation for shoddy merchandise and poor 
service under zayre corp which has restructured the retail 
operations it retained and changed its name to tjx cos inczayre 
stores werent making money 
also zayre was technologically behind ames lacking the 
advanced cash registers and other hardware needed to accomodate 
computerized inventory controls 
industry analysts say the use of sophisticated inventory 
management techniques employing stateoftheart technology 
might be even more important for discounters than for regular 
retailers discounters must carefully monitor costs to maintain 
their slimmer profit margins 
ames went in and refurbished zayre stores to give them a more 
customerfriendly layout and a better merchandise mix staff had 
the concept of customer service drilled into them 
technology was upgraded ames made a 30 million investment in 
cash registers and backoffice equipment to speed customer 
checkout streamline store data collection and provide the 
foundation for further improvements such as barcode scanning 
hollis said the use of scanning had to be postponed within ames 
for a year while the zayre stores were being made compatible it is 
being tested now and should be in place next year 
as in ames original stores the former zayre stores are 
carrying more national brands in apparel for instance 
we have completely remerchandised everything carried in zayres 
stores said hollis 
retail analysts generally give ames high marks for its longterm 
strategy but have taken a waitandsee attitude about the near 
future 
ames lost 207 million or 72 cents a share in the first half 
of this year due to the costs of transforming zayre and 
disappointing retail sales hollis has said the full year will turn 
out to be profitable 
retail analyst elizabeth armstrong of prescott ball amp turben 
said the acquisition of zayre will test their ability for some 
time because it was a major acquisition 
but she said it could pay off 
the combination with zayre is going to give ames quite a lot 
of power she said the environment is competitive and will 
continue to get more competitive but good management can do well 
henry jicha jr an analyst with wood gundy corp thinks ames 
can thrive under its current management 
ames prides itself on its management capability i think 
justly so said jicha 
ames performance in the fourth quarter by far the most 
important time for retailers will provide an indication if 
customers like what ames has done 
the proof of the whole pudding is going to come in the fourth 
quarter said jicha he is recommending purchase of ames stock 
based on a projected return to profitability this year and a sharp 
jump in earnings next year 
in addition to the 254 renamed zayre stores rocky hill 
connbased ames owns 61 others that are retaining the zayre name 
ames said its research indicated that the markets in which the 61 
operate mainly miami chicago washington and baltimore had 
strong customer loyalty to the zayre name

midway airlines chairman david r hinson is 
behind the wheel of his company car a latemodel domestic station 
wagon snaking through a single lane of rainsoaked traffic slowed 
by construction 
the contractor widening the roads outside midway airport had 
promised to keep two lanes open hinson picks up his car phone and 
orders a secretary to complain 
youve got to stay on top of these contractors all the time 
he says 
hinsons conservative car and attention to detail reflect the 
attitude that has made this scrappy regional carrier survive the 
past decade to become what the 56yearold chairman and former 
fighter pilot calls an airline airline 
midway the last us airline certified in the era of regulation 
and first new one to fly under deregulation marks its 10th 
anniversary wednesday 
although it has less than 1 percent of the national airtravel 
market midways business is expanding quickly at a time when 
rivals are worried about keeping passengers in november the 
carrier is opening a second hub in philadelphia and offering 
firstclass service 
midway also is unencumbered by the kind of takeover trauma 
preoccupying its larger chicago neighbor united airlines parent 
ual corp 
we realize that even though were growing rapidly were 
smaller than most of the carriers but were an airline airline 
hinson said in an interview 
an original investor in midway hinson sees the airline as a 
regional carrier providing many of the same services offered by 
larger competitors flights to many cities a frequentflier 
program and international links 
its a nice little airline no doubt about it said john v 
pincavage a partner at the transportation group ltd a new 
yorkbased investment bank that specializes in airline securities 
midway has achieved that status through attention to customer 
service a conservative balance sheet and avoiding direct 
competition with large airlines hinson said 
department of transportation figures on domestic airlines for 
the first nine months of 1989 show midway ranks among the top 10 
for the fewest passenger complaints at an average 146 per 100000 
passengers and in honoring reservations bumping an average 16 
passengers per 10000 boarded 
midway started as a cutrate airline offering pennyamile fares 
in its first promotion on nov 1 1979 when three dc9s flew to 
cleveland detroit and kansas city 
the carrier now serves 51 cites with a fleet of 64 planes from 
midway airport 11 miles southwest of chicagos loop that is about 
half the distance from downtown to ohare international airport 
earlier this year midway signed a 2 billion deal with 
mcdonnelldouglas corp for 74 new jets and agreed to pay 244 
million for 33 twinengine turboprop commuters from a west german 
manufacturer 
while its capacity has steadily increased earnings have varied 
two years of modest profits followed a firstyear loss midway then 
logged three losing years through 1985 when hinson became chairman 
and chief executive officer 
the company since has since reported three consecutive 
profitable years although earnings fell last year one explanation 
for the slump was a drop in passenger traffic blamed on midways 
slow response to triplemileage frequent flier incentives offered 
by other airlines 
we made a mistake hinson said 
midway earned 65 million or 60 cents a share on revenues of 
412 million in 1988 vs 186 million or 170 a share on 
revenues of 3469 million in 1987 
the airline earned 8 million or 62 cents a share on sales of 
233 million for the first six months this year vs 43 million 
or 27 cents a share on 192 million in revenues for the 
yearearlier period 
analysts who follow airline stocks see midway as a solid 
performer in a volatile industry but the airlines 2056 million 
acquisition of eastern airlines assets at philadelphia 
international airport could hurt midways financial performance in 
the next two years 
hinson is counting on the airlines lock on midway airport to 
help pay the cost of developing the philadelphia hub 
we have this chasm to get across but we can fund that out of 
chicago he said it would be a big mistake for us to go to 
philadelphia and try to be successful if we didnt have a pretty 
good airline here in chicago 
in an increasingly competitive industry julius maldutis an 
analyst with salomon brothers inc in new york said midway has a 
strong future 
they have a very important market niche in terms of the midway 
airport dominance that they have successfully developed he said 
i think more importantly they have one of the strongest 
managements in the airline industry in terms of developing that 
niche because it basically boils down to management 
midways success has spawned persistent rumors of a takeover 
but no deal has surfaced midway management treats the 96 percent 
stake purchased earlier this year by ampcopittsburg corp as a 
normal business investment said airline spokeswoman sandra 
allen 
but when its crosstown neighbor ual was in the midst of takeover 
negotiations in august midways board strengthened the companys 
poisonpill defense against hostile suitors 
i mean prudent boards do those things hinson said but 
the boards instructions to me and my feeling as well is that were 
going to operate midway like any business 
if somebody insists on buying the company and they offer a 
price thats so high that the board feels they must accept it then 
well sell the company obviously

a year after starting and losing the fight over 
rjr nabisco inc f ross johnson has all but disappeared from 
public view but he lacks neither money nor activity 
in the aftermath of the 2453 billion battle for the food and 
tobacco giant the johnson era is a memory at rjr nabisco 
acquaintances and associates say its also history to the man who a 
year ago was president and chief executive of the company 
rjr nabisco now owned by the investment firm kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co has moved its headquarters from suburban atlanta to 
midtown manhattan and is headed by former american express co 
president louis gerstner 
the once flamboyant johnson 57 meanwhile is the lowkey 
chairman of rjm group an atlantabased international management 
advisory company organized in february when johnson resigned from 
rjr nabisco 
he took a fair amount of money with him when he left johnson 
who earned a 18 million salary in his final year with rjr 
nabisco received 72 million in continued pay to see him through 
1991 when he will be eligible for retirement benefits 
his golden parachute included nearly 2 million to help 
johnson pay his taxes he also received 192 million worth of rjr 
nabisco stock 
johnson would have been even wealthier had his bid for the 
company prevailed he said during the height of the rjr nabisco 
fight that if successful he could expect to make 100 million in 
seven or eight years 
but making 100 million was not my motive by any stretch of 
the imagination he said then 
nonetheless johnson was seen as pursuing a buyout purely for 
his own greed he was criticized for his initial low 17 billion 
bid and his own builtin rewards in the offer 
his plans to sell off all of the companys nontobacco 
businesses and disregard of rjr nabisco employees also rankled many 
people including the firms board of directors and although his 
252 billion final bid was higher than the kohlberg kravis offer 
it wasnt enough to win 
the record size of the rjr nabisco deal also brought 
unprecedented public attention to the phenomenon of leveraged 
buyouts takeovers largely accomplished through the use of borrowed 
funds 
after kohlberg kravis victory in early december johnson issued 
a statement wishing the new owners good luck and maintaining that 
his initiation of the takeover process benefited the companys 
stockholders he has offered no further public postmortems 
i think hes put that in the past said william liss an 
atlanta consultant who was a senior vice president at rjr nabisco 
under johnson 
liss said he understood that johnson has discussed the takeover 
battle with several authors in an effort to ensure that books about 
the deal are accurate joel koblentz a partner at egon zehnder 
international inc an atlanta executive search firm that has dealt 
with several former rjr nabisco employees said johnson sits on 
eight or nine corporate boards and also has been exploring various 
investment opportunities 
johnson has stepped out of the public spotlight by his own 
choice koblentz said 
hes picking and choosing his activities koblentz said 
he has a number of interests both social and business and a 
number of homes 
koblentz said johnsons lowkey nature is quite in contrast to 
the style he practiced as rjr nabiscos ceo 
we havent seen him on the restaurant and party circuit as 
much as he used to be koblentz said he used to be very 
visible

lin broadcasting corp said wednesday that mccaw 
cellular communications inc will have to extend its 275 billion 
offer for about 40 percent of lins shares 
the mccaw offer of 125 a share for 22 million of lins shares 
is currently scheduled to expire friday but lin said mccaw will 
have to extend it because mccaw has failed to announced sufficient 
committed financing for the deal 
lin said federal securities regulations would require mccaw to 
keep its offer open five days after announcing fully committed 
financing 
mccaw the nations largest cellular telephone company that has 
been pursuing lin since june said in a statement that it was 
moving forward with our financing beyond the initial round of 
commitments 
the kirkland washbased mccaw said last week that it had 
received 12 billion in financing commitments from three banks 
that are highly confident they could arrange a syndicate of banks 
to commit the balance of the 45 billion in financing needed 
within a few weeks 
mccaw wants to arrange financing for more than the costs of the 
tender offer alone because it intends to buy metromedia cos 
halfinterest in a cellular franchise in new york city for 19 
billion as well 
the issue now at hand is will lin conduct a fair auction 
mccaw said in wednesdays statement 
new yorkbased lin has taken no position on the mccaw offer and 
wont do so until it hears from bellsouth corp the regional 
telephone company based in atlanta with whom it has a separate deal 
to merge cellular telephone operations 
a spokeswoman for bellsouth said the company expects to respond 
to the mccaw offer for lin soon but could not say when 
in national overthecounter trading wednesday lin rose 50 
cents a share to 10925 while mccaw rose 50 cents a share to 
4050

oil futures prices ended mixed wednesday with 
the crude oil market under pressure from growing concern about 
excess opec production 
analysts said the crude market largely ignored an american 
petroleum institute report that showed a decline in oil inventories 
last week 
on the new york mercantile exchange the december contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude 
finished 10 cents lower at 1962 a barrel january crude ended

5340 cents a gallon and later contracts also rose 
november heating oil lost 01 cent to 5844 cents a gallon and 
december declined 020 cent to 5867 cents a gallon while 
contracts for later delivery showed gains and losses 
analysts said api statistics released after the close of trading 
on tuesday showed that inventories of crude and products declined 
in the week ended oct 20 although the data should have been 
bullish concern about rising oil production dampened the markets 
enthusiasm traders said 
the markets sagged as traders continued to express some 
concern over higher opec production as well as evidence of sluggish 
us demand said andrew lebow senior broker and analyst with 
edampf man international futures inc 
the api data showed that crude stocks fell 63 million barrels 
to 3365 million barrels total gasoline supplies were down 21 
million barrels to 2232 million and heating oil declined 374000 
barrels to about 120 million barrels 
industry estimates suggest that the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries is continuing to increase production opec 
output recently swelled to more than 22 million barrels a day well 
above its official quota of 205 million barrels a day 
various opec members also have suggested recently that the 
cartel will raise production further as worldwide demand for opec 
oil increases in coming years 
nevertheless us demand is expected to decline putting 
downward pressure on oil prices

soviet workers at six mines called strikes 
wednesday in arctic circle coalfields that were hit by largescale 
walkouts last summer the regions strike leader said 
about 5000 miners had voted for walkouts by wednesday evening 
and up to 20000 at 12 mines were expected to strike said valentin 
kopasov chairman of the vorkuta area strike committee 
the strike violated a law passed this month by the soviet 
legislature setting arbitration procedures for wouldbe strikers 
and banning walkouts in such vital areas as energy defense and 
transportation 
first deputy premier lev voronin said this month that power 
stations and public utilities had 45 million fewer tons of coal on 
hand than at the same time last year due to the summer strikes 
he said miners would have to work harder to avoid rationing of 
heat light and electricity this winter 
this summer strikes in virtually all the soviet unions major 
coalfields from central asia in the south to the vorkuta fields in 
the far north paralyzed much of its coal industry the miners who 
demanded better working conditions and consumer supplies as well as 
more financial independence for their mines went back to work 
after the government conceded to almost all their demands 
but this week miners in vorkuta and in the western siberian 
mining town of mezhdurechensk declared the government had failed to 
come through on some of the promised benefits 
about 20000 mezhdurechensk miners staged a twohour warning 
strike monday despite officials protests that they were showing 
disrespect for the new law 
the vorkuta strikers demanded the government fulfill its 
promises of this summer and punish officials who had gone back on 
their word they also wanted official status to be granted to new 
committees formed to defend workers interests kopasov said 
as he spoke wednesday by telephone from vorkuta word arrived at 
strike headquarters that the towns chief prosecutor had ordered 
officials at one of the striking mines to give him a list of the 
walkouts organizers kopasov said 
he said that made the strike leaders expect a crackdown from 
local authorities 
at a news conference tuesday the head of the interior ministry 
troops that have been sent in to quell major unrest around the 
soviet union in recent months said his soldiers would not be called 
on to repress any renewed strikes 
that is a politicallegal question we handle only massive 
disorders said colgen yuri shatalin 
this summers coal strikes involved virtually no violence 
strikers policed their own ranks and the authorities generally 
refrained from intervening 
but that was before the new law on strikes when the strikers 
legal status was unclear the government has not indicated what its 
response to such open defiance of the new law will be 
there has been no report of reprisals against the mezhdurechensk 
workers who struck monday 
kopasov said the vorkuta strikers also were demanding 
publication of an appeal to the countrys workers that called for 
solidarity and condemned the new strike law 
the law is aimed at depriving workers of the right to the 
extreme measure of striking and at distancing the worker from the 
process of democratization it said in part 
the strikers also put forth several political demands including 
that the countrys legislature consider doing away with the article 
in the constitution that makes the communist party the leading 
and guiding force of soviet society kopasov added

a class action lawsuit was filed wednesday on 
behalf of a group of campeau corp shareholders alleging officials 
of the struggling real estate and retailing giant misled them about 
its ability to repay a huge debt 
the lawsuit was brought in us district court against the 
torontobased campeau chairman robert campeau and other top 
executives 
campeau owns a range of department stores in the united states 
and is perhaps best known for its purchase of bloomingdales the 
swank east coast retailing chain 
the companys 115 billion debt has injected uncertainty into 
the corporate bond market and raised the likelihood that 
bloomingdales and other valuable campeau assets will have to be 
sold 
the lawsuit seeks to determine whether the price of campeaus 
common stock was artificially inflated by alleged 
misrepresentations about the companys financial situation a 
damage amount isnt specified 
although campeau corp incurred significant debt in connection 
with its massive acquisitions throughout 1988 and until 
midseptember 1989 it made positive statements regarding its 
financial condition and it repeatedly reassured the investing 
public that it would be able to repay its debt the suit said 
the motivation for this deceit was that campeau needed 
additional financial capital from private and public sources it 
said 
the lawsuit was filed on behalf of all people who purchased 
campeau stock between april 1 and sept 19 when the company 
disclosed it reached an agreement with one of its major 
stockholders olympia amp york developments ltd on a 250 million 
loan to help the company meet interest payments due on its bonds 
and help its stores pay for winter and spring merchandise 
the lawsuit said news of the companys financial restructuring 
sent the price of campeau stock tumbling and caused substantial 
losses to shareholders 
the loan from olympia amp york was be used to provide cash for 
campeaus two retail units allied stores corp and federated 
department stores inc 
besides bloomingdales campeaus us retail operations include 
the jordan marsh sterns ralphs lazarus burdines and 
richsgoldsmiths chains 
campeau said last month that bloomingdales probably would have 
to be sold as part of a restructuring to reduce the companys debt 
exposure 
a japanese newspaper reported wednesday that tokyu department 
stores ltd a large tokyobased retailing chain had offered 13 
billion to buy bloomingdales campeau declined to comment on the 
report in the daily nihon keizai shimbun

columbia savings amp loan association 
said wednesday it lost 2263 million in the third quarter because 
it was forced by new laws to record 3575 million in losses 
related to its huge junk bond holdings 
columbia the biggest junk bond investor among the nations 
thrifts earned 163 million in the same period last year for the 
three months ended sept 30 losses amounted to 1157 per share 
compared with earnings of 37 cents per share in the same quarter in 
1988 
under the leadership of chairman thomas spiegel a close friend 
of junk bond wizard michael milken columbia for years angered 
federal thrift regulators by amassing a huge portfolio of the 
highyield highrisk securities 
unlike some thrifts however columbia in 1986 and 1987 made big 
profits on the investments which now constitute about 30 percent 
of its 127 billion in total assets 
on wednesday the thrift reported an accounting loss of 1302 
million resulting from the savings and loan bailout bill signed in 
august by president bush which requires thrifts to get rid of all 
their junk bond investments by 1994 
columbia said it also added 2273 million to its reserves for 
losses on its junkbond portfolio bringing those reserves to 300 
million or about 67 percent of its total investment in the 
securities 
the market for highyield highrisk securities has weakened 
severely in recent months and the accounting loss of 1302 
million could be revised for the better if it improves the company 
said 
in the future thrifts will have to invest in such bonds through 
separately capitalized affiliates rather than using 
governmentinsured deposits 
spiegel said that as columbia refocuses on its lending business 
we remain one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the 
industry 
under the bailout bill sampls were required to have tangible 
capital the excess of real assets over liabilities immediately 
and reach 3 percent tangible capital by the end of 1994 
columbia had tangible capital of 6 percent before wednesdays 
writeoffs after taking them it has 36 percent spokeswoman lenore

sci television inc a privately held tv station 
company struggling to meet payments on its 13 billion debt said 
wednesday it was proposing a sweeping capital restructuring plan 
the plan includes an offer to exchange about 665 million in 
public and privately held bonds for a combination of stock and new 
debt and a deferment of a 153 million scheduled repayment of 
principal due last month on 650 million in bank loans 
sci which owns six television stations said the overall 
objective of its plan to realign its capital structure was to 
reduce scheduled debt service requirements by an unspecified amount 
in addition it said the plan would give the company a chance 
to implement an orderly asset sales program 
a call was placed to a new york law firm said to represent 
bondholders but it was not returned 
sci television which was once part of the cable and tv company 
storer communications was created in 1987 when it was acquired in 
a leveraged buyout 
the company is 45 percent owned by the former shareholders of 
sci holdings inc which had been organized in 1985 by the 
investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co to buy the stations 
from storer and 55 percent owned by gillett corp controlled by 
nashville tennbased entrepreneur george gillett 
if bondholders and bankers accepted the plan it would result in 
current bondholders owning about 30 percent of the equity in the 
company gillett with 41 percent banks with 5 percent the former 
sci holdings shareholders with 15 percent and 9 percent to be 
apportioned 
gillett would continue to manage the stations 
the exchange offer is scheduled to expire at midnight nov 22 
sci said it must be tendered at least 90 percent of principal 
amount of each series of previously issued securities under the 
exchange offer for it to be obligated to make the exchange 
the company said that in the event that the restructuring is not 
completed there can be no assurance that the company will not 
elect to file for protection under applicable bankruptcy laws

an investment group and the largest 
unsecured creditor of sharon steel corp said wednesday they have 
agreed to cosponsor a plan to buy the companys steel operations 
and bring the company out of bankruptcy proceedings 
the investment group including new yorkbased castle harlan 
inc and two former sharon executives proposes to acquire sharons 
steel operations by paying cash and assuming liabilities in a deal 
valued at more than 300 million 
quantum fund sharons largest creditor with claims exceeding 
100 million on the companys bonds would purchase up to 50 
million in equity in the new company 
were hoping and offering that other creditors join with us in 
that infusion said raymond wechsler financial adviser to 
quantum an investment fund and cochairman of the committee of 
unsecured creditors 
sharons profitable nonsteel businesses mueller brass co in 
port huron mich and coal copper and gold properties would be 
shifted to a new company that would be owned by creditors 
the plan to be filed in us bankruptcy court within 60 days 
is contingent on financing 
sharon steel filed for reorganization under chapter ll of the 
us bankruptcy code on april 17 1987 listing debts of 740 
million the company employs about 2400 workers producing a 
variety of carbon and specialty steel products 
despite the reorganization sharon has had to depend on its 
nonsteel operations to turn a profit 
walter sieckman former chief operating officer of sharon and a 
member of the castle harlan group said another major creditor afc 
corp has approved the plan quantum and afc together control 
about 40 percent of sharons debt to bondholders he said 
the bank group also includes former sharon executive vice 
president wolfgang jansen 
sieckman said the bidders assume there will be a mild recession 
in the steel industry continuing through 1990 the company would 
need about 100 million in capital improvements 
he said he saw no reason to streamline sharons varied lines of 
carbon and specialty steel products 
we would like to make it bigger more viable he said 
herbert minkel a new york attorney representing unsecured 
creditors said the proposal dispels pessimistic predictions by 
sharon steels chief operating officer e leonard kern who 
replaced sieckman 
if youd read some of his comments youd think there was no 
one in the western world that would be interested in buying sharon 
steel he said 
kern has said sharon steel is losing money on its steel 
operations and that unless production costs are reduced it might 
not survive without continued support from its profitable nonsteel 
operations 
kern and united steelworkers local 1197 president howard clark 
were not available for comment their secretaries said wednesday

kemper financial services inc said wednesday it 
had stopped doing business with four wall street firms involved in 
computerized program trading saying the strategy had scared away 
investors by increasing stock market volatility 
the chicagobased money manager cited what it called the 
disruptive and destabilizing influence of the trading strategy 
which some blame for worsening the 1987 crash and the recent friday 
the 13th plunge 
kemper which has about 75 billion in its stock portfolio out 
of 57 billion in total assets under management said it had ended 
equity business with four firms that conduct program trading for 
their own accounts it did not identify the firms 
the practice of trading millions of shares of stock in seconds 
via computerized buy and sell programs which are used mainly by 
huge institutional investors has been accused of heightening 
stock market price swings that volatility is seen as frightening 
individual investors out of the market 
after the 1987 crash most major brokerages curtailed program 
trading for their own accounts socalled proprietary trading 
but use of the strategy recently has increased 
the new york stock exchange said program trading accounted for 
138 percent of its average daily volume in september up from 103 
percent in august and the highest percentage since the exchange 
began the calculation in july 1988 
some experts recently cited program trading as a factor when the 
dow jones industrial average plummeted more than 190 points in the 
final hours of trading on oct 13 and 85 points this past monday 
morning 
we believe that in the present environment index arbitrage 
generally increases intraday market price volatility which 
undermines investors confidence in the fair functioning of 
markets said stephen timbers kempers chief investment officer 
we hope that this practice stops and prefer to conduct our 
business with brokerage firms who do not engage in this trading 
strategy he said 
index arbitrage is a form of program trading that employs 
computers to rapidly buy and sell huge blocks of stocks in new york 
and stockindex futures in chicago in an attempt to profit from 
minute differences in prices on the two markets 
in september salomon brothers inc morgan stanley amp co 
kidder peabody amp co and goldman sachs amp co conducted the most 
program trading of wall street firms according to the nyse 
goldman and salomon said they were not among the four cut off by 
kemper kidder peabody and bear stearns amp co another major 
programtrading firm declined to comment 
a spokeswoman for morgan stanley which resumed program trading 
in february said the firm does business with kemper but had not 
yet been informed whether it was one of the four 
we believe that our position is reasonable said the 
spokeswoman who asked not to be named during periods of market 
stress we will suspend proprietary arbitrage trading to avoid 
contributing to intraday volatility 
kempers announcement was praised by several other money 
managers who said they also would consider discontinuing placing 
stock orders with brokerages that engage in program trading for 
their own accounts 
i think those guys are terrific said new york money manager 
james cramer of cramer amp co 
we didnt have this horrible kind of volatility when these 
firms were refraining from it cramer said now that theyre 
back we have the volatility 
nobody needs that kind of volatility when theres nothing 
different in the companies outlook said david dreman a 
managing director of dreman value management which has 4 billion 
in assets about 85 percent in stocks 
these methods work absolutely independent of the fundamentals 
in the economy and the stock market 
dreman said a boycott of firms that conduct index arbitrage 
would be very effective and said his firm would consider one if 
clients agreed to it 
defenders said program trading has been made a scapegoat for 
oftennormal market fluctuations they blame market volatility not 
on progam trading but on an overdependence on intermediate dealers 
whose job is to bring together buyers and sellers 
its a shootthemessenger issue said r steven wunsch 
vice president for financial futures at kidder peabody 
arbitragers do bring selling pressure from one market to another 
market but the selling pressure came first they didnt cause it

the feisty founder of cineplex odeon north 
americas secondbiggest theater chain plans to make a 
multimilliondollar bid to reclaim his company cineplex said 
wednesday 
garth drabinsky in concert with longtime partner myron 
gottlieb is putting together a deal already accepted in principle 
by the companys two biggest shareholders who together own a 
majority of the stock 
the proposal is worth 1640 canadian dollars a share or about 
781 million canadian dollars for the 476 million shares 
outstanding however drabinsky and gottlieb already control 
between 7 percent and 8 percent of the stock and could join another 
shareholder to make the bid lowering their financing hurdle 
in a statement cineplex said financing is still being arranged 
and that the bid may not proceed under an agreement the pair must 
make a formal offer by nov 22 
drabinsky who turns 41 on friday began his career as a lawyer 
specializing in entertainment law he founded the company a decade 
ago in toronto by building a pioneering multiscreen movie theater 
cineplex now owns 1870 screens at 500 locations all but one of 
them in north america its the biggest chain in canada with 560 
screens 
the company is saddled with about 750 million canadian dollars 
in longterm debt making the buyout package worth more than 14 
billion canadian dollars 
we thought it was an appropriate and fair bid said sandra 
kolber a member of a special committee of the cineplex board 
examining offers from montreal 
the committee was formed following an abortive attempt by 
drabinsky in may to seize control by buying out the secondbiggest 
shareholder claridge inc controlled by montrealbased 
businessman charles bronfman 
that move enraged mca inc the los angelesbased entertainment 
giant which owns the biggest block of cineplex stock 236 million 
shares mca succeeded in getting canadian regulators to stay 
drabinskys hand by insisting he make the same 1750ashare offer 
to all shareholders 
the cineplex board then created the special committee to seek 
buyout offers for the entire company wednesdays announcement 
with details of a bid in the works caps weeks of speculation 
although it left unanswered the big questions of financing and 
whether there are other serious bidders 
neither drabinsky nor gottlieb responded to requests wednesday

mercedesbenz of north america inc has paid 91 
million in corporate taxes on its massachusetts earnings settling 
a case gov michael s dukakis said will be a landmark for other 
states 
the settlement ended a nearly 5year fight between the state and 
the montvale njbased company that had argued it did not owe the 
state a dime and had failed to contest a lawsuit in massachusetts 
courts seeking the payment 
the state won a default judgment against the company in may in 
suffolk county superior court and seized a companyowned car from a 
mercedes executive this summer the 74000 car was auctioned by 
the state and sold for 50000 dukakis said 
massachusetts attorney general james m shannon said the 
settlement was the single largest tax judgment in state history and 
came about when he took steps to seize new jersey property of 
mercedes 
were going to make sure the big guys pay their fair share of 
taxes not just the working men and women of massachusetts 
shannon said 
i hope it is a clear and concise message to all taxpayers 
especially corporate taxpayers that its not just the little guys 
who pay taxes said dukakis who has made collection of 
delinquent taxes a priority in his administration 
mercedesbenz is pleased that its tax dispute with the 
commonwealth of massachusetts has been resolved in an equitable 
manner through goodfaith negotiations initiated by 
mercedesbenz company spokesman bob neary said in montvale 
revenue commissioner stephen w kidder said the case began in 
1985 when his department investigated six foreign car companies he 
said five were cooperative and paid 10 million in taxes but 
mercedes declined until last month 
since then they have been completely cooperative we are 
delighted they have seen the light kidder said 
mercedesbenz had argued it did not owe massachusetts any taxes 
since it had no property in the state and since the imported german 
cars were sold directly to dealers as they left ships in states 
other than massachusetts 
but kidder and shannon said the company had employees based in 
massachusetts to handle warranty matters state lemon law issues 
and to work with dealers 
in order to have to pay corporate taxes in massachusetts a 
company must have some form of connection to the state what tax 
officials call a nexus 
kidder said in most cases it is clear whether or not a company 
must pay 
a chain of retail stores with headquarters in another state owes 
massachusetts corporate taxes on its income from massachusetts 
kidder said while a company that does strictly mailorder business 
from another state does not 
kidder said wednesdays settlement covers mercedes taxes from 
1966 the year the state adopted a corporate excise tax through 
1985 the period covered by the lawsuit 
mercedes intends to file tax returns for the remaining years he 
said 
it was a total victory kidder said

investigators searching for the cause of 
a huge plastics plant explosion discovered three more bodies in the 
twisted rubble wednesday and continued the search for 17 others 
presumed killed 
in all five bodies have been found since a series of explosions 
ripped through the phillips petroleum co plant on monday 
company officials learned that one man who had been listed as 
missing was not at the plant at the time plant manager robert benz 
said 
assistant secretary of labor john scannell who heads the 
occupational safety and health administration toured the plant 
wednesday with other federal investigators sent in by us labor 
secretary elizabeth dole 
its total devastation scannell said in 30 years of 
experience in the chemical industry ive never seen such massive 
equipment twisted and strung about 
its still a very hazardous situation with twisted steel and 
columns the total destruction of some parts you can only imagine 
the force of the explosion bolts were sheared right off and 
twisted like pretzels 
the plant which produced 45 million pounds of plastics a day 
exploded in a series of blasts monday afternoon throwing metal and 
concrete debris as far as six miles miles of twisted strings of 
pipe are piled haphazardly around the plant some buildings are 
gone and eight giant chemical reactors vessels look like huge 
battered tin cans 
osha had a team of 15 investigators including chemical and 
structural engineers at the site scannell said they will help 
with recovery operations and offer technical assistance and advice 
and then we want to determine a cause scannell said we 
want to come up with prevention efforts to keep this from occurring 
again 
virtually every piece of material is being looked at as a 
piece of the puzzle scannell said adding the osha crew expects 
to remain at the site for several days well be here as long as 
it takes 
the area where authorities believe most of the 18 missing 
workers are is a twisted jumble of rubble and debris scannell said 
the recovery of victims could be days could be weeks its very 
complicated part of the problem is that when one piece of 
wreckage is moved it sets off a chain reaction of falling debris 
scannell said 
on wednesday the body of one of three contract workers 
unaccounted for since the explosions was found in a maintenance 
area in the morning the two other bodies were found separately 
later in the day but both were in the same vicinity near a storage 
area for polyethylene pellets said bill wicker another company

chemical reactor but phillips officials said they dont know how 
the gases were ignited

an excellent safety record that included a 5 millionmanhour 
stretch with no safetyrelated work injuries that cost an employee 
work time that would cover a period of some 2 years benz said 
but union officials say they are questioning work schedules that 
may have left less experienced or tired employees on the job

utilization of subcontractors within the plant said bob wages 
national vice president of the oil chemical and atomic workers 
union wed like to know if these were contributing factors to 
the accident

rebuild at the site but he was uncertain what type of facility 
would replace the plastics plant

two months he said but some may be laid off later phillips will 
try to find work for some of them at the companys other operations
