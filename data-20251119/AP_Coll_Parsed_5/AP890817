former gov jim hunt ended months of 
speculation wednesday when he said he not seek a replay of the 
bitter 1984 senate campaign with republican rival sen jesse helms 
this was pretty well settled some time back said hunt 
citing a heart attack and stroke suffered by his mother hunt and 
his parents live on adjoining farms in wilson county 
we just cant walk away from that he said you do your 
duty to your family first 
helms defeated hunt in 1984 by a 52to48 percent margin they 
spent a combined 26 million then a record for a senate race the 
campaign was marked by negative campaigning and personal slurs but 
hunt said the grueling 1984 campaign was not the reason for his 
decision not to run 
hunt 52 is a partner in a raleigh law firm he served four 
years as lieutenant governor and was the first governor to serve 
successive fouryear terms 
helms in a prepared statement said he was relieved not to be 
facing hunt again mr hunt has demonstrated in four elections 
that he is always a formidable opponent helms said i would be 
less than honest if i did not acknowledge that i was glad to learn 
of his announcement today 
state democratic party chairman lawrence davis said in a 
statement that hunt would have been an excellent candidate but 
our party has a number of excellent potential candidates any one 
of whom can win the 1990 senate race

as exxon prepares to pull out thousands of 
oil cleanup workers next month the people of valdez are bracing for 
an uncertain winter with a rising crime rate growing landfill and a 
shrinking population 
already the frenzy that followed the march 24 spill from the 
exxon valdez is giving way to quiet few people sleep in their cars 
on the city streets anymore new restaurants on wheels are preparing 
to leave town 
poor valdez i dont know how it survived said judy hobson 
a vendor whose portable shop is nestled with others in a dusty 
parking lot hobson like many plans to be gone by the end of 
september 
many residents who gave up jobs for bigger paychecks working on 
the cleanup will come home to find their jobs taken by newcomers 
living in temporary housing 
people who dont have jobs anymore are going to have a place to 
live those with jobs wont valdez city manager doug griffin 
says some workers with money but no jobs may leave or become a 
problem 
you have the potential for drinking increased domestic 
violence he said 
were going to see a change in our town griffin says it 
could change the politics it may change school enrollment the 
demographics could change its going to be interesting to see how 
the town reacts this winter 
more than 10000 workers and 1000 vessels are laboring on the 
12 billion effort to clean up oil smeared on hundreds of miles of 
oncepristine shoreline the spill killed thousands of birds and sea 
mammals amd devastated the fishing industry in prince william sound 
kodiak and cook inlet 
of the 1566 miles of shoreline fouled when the exxon valdez 
spilled about 11 million gallons of north slope crude oil only 520 
miles have been treated to the satisfaction of the coast guard but 
those beaches are not oilfree in most cases the approval to move 
off a beach hinges on removal of only gross contamination 
exxon has set a sept 15 withdrawal deadline saying it would be 
unsafe to continue cleanup work in the face of winter storms it is 
unclear whether exxon will return in force next year 
the state on tuesday sued exxon corp and six other oil companies 
claiming they were negligent in preventing and cleaning up the 
spill it is expected the court case will last up to a decade 
like the spill the pullouts effects will ripple through 
government agencies and leave their mark on this and other coastal 
communities 
already the tide that left sleepy valdez a raging boomtown and 
prince william sound a noisy beehive of activity is shifting the 
daily operational meetings at the department of environmental 
conservation were reduced to three nights a week then to one night 
a week at the exxon headquarters 
things sure arent the same said a bored security guard 
the state environmental agency which has spent about 9 million 
on the spill in the coming weeks plans to cut its oil spill 
response force of about 130 people by half in valdez and probably 
more in kenai seward and homer 
fish processing plants are working well below capacity because 
fishing in the sound has been shut down for much of the summer and 
workers are scarce 
some tour operators in valdez have been hurt by the spill other 
businesses such as restaurants hotels and recreational vehicle 
parks have prospered griffin said there were 23 bedandbreakfasts 
before the spill there are more than 100 now there are 10 new 
restaurants many on wheels 
valdez swamped in the early days of the spill is planning to 
lay off temporary workers and prepare for social political and 
economic problems in the wake of exxons withdrawal officials 
bracing for the pullout say they are unsure what may be caused by 
thousands of oil spill workers pouring through the city on their way 
elsewhere 
crime is up and more violent griffin said burglaries are 
expected to increase as people leave town i feel sorry for exxon 
veco and norcon they are going to see lots of stuff walk away he 
said 
the city landfill is filling up the citys overtime bills each 
month are running 150000 to 175000 
there likely will be a glut of office space when the summer ends 
and the housing market also may be flooded the towns population 
probably will not fall back to 3300 but likely will drop to about 
4500 from 13000 griffin said that kind of concerns me people 
just hanging around this winter 
for valdez the spill will not be over when exxon pulls out but 
just entering a new phase when problems may not be so apparent 
griffin said 
but im proud of the city i dont think any other city in the 
state could have handled it as well we took some pretty good shots 
we didnt get knocked out were going to make it it may be a split 
decision but were going to make it

ban non saoae thailand ap the war has nothing to do with 
them but without warning it comes roaring in often on the 729 
people of ban non saoae who make their living by farming 
the war is cambodias government forces fighting rebels and 
the villagers have the misfortune of living close to the border 
where the fighting frequently breaks out with artillery barrages 
that send shells crashing into thailand 
bunker is one of the few english words that have worked their 
way into the local language and thats because almost every family 
has a bunker under their stiltraised wooden houses 
phra attikan arun a 30yearold buddhist monk is recording the 
war 
when the artillery shells start pounding in he turns on his tape 
recorder and runs to the safety of his bunker 
later he plays the tapes for visitors to show them what its 
like to live in ban non saoae in thailands prachinburi province 
the provincial defense office says that in prachinburi alone 36 
villagers have been killed and 120 wounded since 1984 more than 
15000 have fled 
the effects of the war on ban noan saoae also are documented in 
a few dozen color snapshots the monks have arranged on a display 
board at their temple the photographs show the bodies of two 
victims of an august 1988 shelling people building bunkers looking 
at houses blown to pieces and gathered around an unexploded 
artillery shell 
the fighting flared in late july just after villagers planted 
the rainyseason crop scores of shells hit this and other nearby 
villages 
a woman wanpen thonchul 22 was wounded by shrapnel 
several hundred women and children fled down the road to the 
kaset college auditorium where they slept on the concrete floor 
tin janshu 59 fled to his bunker after shells crashed in the 
paddy field where he was working 
when it was over tin sat on the bunker saying he doesnt know 
why they are fighting in cambodia 
i only grow my rice to eat he said 
why not move to another village 
how can i move the coconut and fruit trees have been growing 
here since my parents if i move somewhere else by the time i can 
grow a coconut tree like this i would be dead 
my grandfather died here my father died here so ill die here 
also 
dum jankeja 64 said he also will stay dum and his wife share a 
bunker with three other households and he said adversity has 
brought the villagers closer 
we have to go through this together we help each other out if 
we go into the bunker we go in together 
less fortunate was somwang janpit 22 one of at least three 
villagers who recently lost legs to landmines 
in june he was searching for bamboo shoots in a deserted field 
he thought the blast he heard was someone shooting birds until he 
saw his right leg was gone 
yes im angry he said now i cant take care of my father 
and mother 
his mother 63 now toils nine hours a day in the fields to feed 
him his handicapped sister and their father 84 
at the village school anything that sounds like gunfire sends 
the children dashing for the bunker on the compound heavy shelling 
last year shattered several school buildings 
but most students have learned to cope a teacher said 
their homes are here in the village when they hear it the 
shelling they are scared when its over they go and play like 
children everywhere

hooves thunder and swords flash as 
warriors on horseback battle hordes of infidels a leopard stalks a 
bear dances and a princess in white chiffon smiles radiantly at the 
assembled masses 
the famed moscow circus is getting its best acts together and 
taking them on the road this year the road is winding through the 
united states and canada for only the second time in the past decade 
among those taking part is showman tamerlane nugzarov leader of 
the famous troupe of horsemen who perform the theatrical 
eyepopping acrobatics that are among the bestknown features of the 
storied circus 
but while nugzarov is one of the soviet unions great showmen he 
would not be embarking on a ninemonth north america tour if not for 
the promotional abilities of an even flashier figure president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
hes the best promotion man whos ever left the soviet union 
said steve leber a new york promoter who says he is putting up more 
than 15 million to finance the tour he has singlehandedly made 
the american public curious about the soviet union 
leber and the circus first capitalized on the wests fascination 
with all things soviet last year when the circus toured the united 
states for the first time in 10 years 
this year the circus and leber have signed an agreement to keep 
the circus returning yearly circus authorities pay the performers 
regular salaries and leber covers north american expenses 
hopefully well gross four times that leber said of his 
investment 
he said the deal guarantees the circus against loss and gives it 
more than half the profits 
this years road show goes beyond the regular moscow circus 
leber said it is among the best of 1400 circus acts nationwide the 
troupe recently completed a onemonth dress rehearsal in leningrad 
and opens its north american tour in toronto on wednesday night 
among the acts is bear trainer raisa ibragimovish who shares a 
first name and a strong resemblance with the soviet unions first 
lady 
the show also features an acrobat who looks like actor michael j 
fox haunting russian folk songs and soviet and us flags that 
seem to appear when the lush music hits its most grandiose peaks 
despite the goodwill there often are snags when western business 
interests hatch deals with communist countries 
look what happened in china said leber its 
nervewracking 
the moscow circus in fact almost remained stuck in its 
namesake on the day that animals and equipment were to be loaded 
onto a freighter for the voyage to canada the culture ministry 
denied the circus a license to export the show 
one of the underlings in the ministry of culture said your 
contract is too long and too good were holding up the ship 
leber said 
even a few days delay would have jeopardized wednesday nights 
opening at the canadian national exhibition in toronto leber said 
i had the blessing of the circus and i thought they had 
control of their own destiny with this new freedom of gorbachevs 
reforms but the ministry of culture still had that one power and 
with it they could really mess you up this is no way to do 
business 
a day later after leber cut the length of the contract from five 
years to one the ministry relented 
when ministry officials were asked what happened spokesman 
vladimir benyukh replied that is an internal affair and they do 
not have to divulge the secrets 
culture minister vasily zakharov apparently was not involved he 
had lost his job days earlier when the newly powerful soviet 
parliament rejected him in the countrys first cabinet confirmation 
hearings the culture ministry has long been a source of shame for 
progressive soviets since it was responsible for repressing 
artists theater directors and writers who didnt toe the communist 
party line 
if anything the soviets involved in the circus are learning a 
little about westernstyle promotion 
meanwhile his general manager ted thrasher is offering much 
gentler lessons to the circus people about the harsh reality of 
competition in the western world 
late in the evening after one of the last rehearsals in 
leningrad tour general manager ted thrasher and leber dined with 
nugzarov and some other soviets someone reveling in the spirit of 
sovietamerican goodwill offered a toast to christopher columbus 
the discoverer of america 
well we can toast him thrasher allowed but this is a 
very important lesson christopher columbus was not the first but 
he had the best publicity

an agreement has been reached between 
federal officials and the sierra club acknowledging that the 
plutonium recovery incinerator at the rocky flats nuclear weapons 
plant needs a state permit 
officials said the agreement was reached monday between the 
sierra club which had filed a lawsuit over the issue and the us 
department of energy which owns the plant which manufactures 
plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons 
the plan stipulates that the doe wont restart the incinerator in 
building 771 until it gets a permit and holds public hearings 
fred dowsett of the state health department said the 
incinerator probably will be shut down six months to a year during 
the permit application process 
the new permit procedures could hasten a crisis in waste disposal 
at the plant which is storing wastes tainted with both hazardous 
materials and radioactivity because of a lack of an approved waste 
disposal site 
gov roy romer has vowed to close the plant if that total exceeds 
1601 cubic yards and officials say that limit could be reached in 
march a permanent waste site is planned but not open in new 
mexico 
the agreement was signed by the us department of justice for 
the doe rockwell international which runs rocky flats and the 
sierra club 
the sierra club said burning a mixture of plutonium and poisonous 
chemicals without a stateauthorized permit illegally endangers 
public health 
most of the plutonium processed can be recovered without the 
incinerator said chemist niels schonbeck of the rocky flats 
environmental monitoring council a group opposed to the incinerator

salman rushdie whose writings ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini found offensive to mohammed and allah has spent seven 
months in hiding cut off from friends and protected by armed guards 
on feb 14 the iranian leader declared rushdies novel the 
satanic verses blasphemous and told his followers to kill the 
author the shiite moslem patriarch died june 3 but his sentence 
lives 
rushdies american wife marianne wiggins has been quoted as 
saying the couple have moved 56 times to a succession of safe 
houses used for spies and intelligence contacts 
friends say the rushdies seem in good spirits but that the 
indianborn british writer a nonpracticing moslem feels his 
seclusion may end only if iran formally withdraws the threat 
he issued a statement soon after khomeini passed sentence 
expressing profound regret for any offense to moslems but iran 
rejected it 
among parts of the the satanic verses many moslems find 
offensive are a scene in which prostitutes are given the names of 
the prophet mohammeds wives and implications that mohammed wrote 
the koran the moslem holy book 
hes been silenced effectively and cannot speak in his own 
defense and thats a terrible plight for any writer to be in its 
hideous said a friend lisa appignamesi 
its very hard to speak for another person but i think hes 
bearing up very well she said in an interview ms appignamesi is 
coauthor of the rushdie file a recent book about the case 
rushdie 42 and his wife of 19 months have not been seen in 
public since police escorted them from their north london home on 
feb 14 rushdie has not given interviews and ms wiggins 41 also 
a novelist has said isolation is their greatest burden 
you can no longer pass down the street and encounter a 
stranger the london magazine options quoted her as saying last 
month you lose all sense of spontaneity because you live in fear 
fear is an element that used to be on the far side of the earth 
ms wiggins says she and her husband keep diaries stay in touch 
with their families and world events and always have at least one 
armed bodyguard with them 
they have dined occasionally with friends literary acquaintances 
or such political figures as neil kinnock leader of opposition 
labor party but friends say the occasions have become fewer at the 
insistence of the guards 
the rushdies have occupied a succession of houses operated by 
special branch security police and mi5 the domestic intelligence 
agency ms wiggins was quoted as telling the sunday telegraph 
she returned to their home in londons islington district to pick 
up belongings but neither has been home since 
their friends literary agents and publishers do not know their 
whereabouts according to the london newspaper the independent it 
said the rushdies do not take telephone calls and mail is sent by a 
roundabout route via police but they can respond to messages 
security has cost tens of thousands of dollars the independent 
said 
more than 11 million hardback copies of the satanic verses 
have been sold including 600000 in the united states earning 
rushdie more than 19 million said sources at his publishers 
viking penguin 
one said viking penguin had spent an amount equal to the 
royalties on security for its buildings and at bookstores so the 
major winner is rushdie in a sense plans for a paperback edition 
had been shelved 
rushdie continues to review books for the observer a london 
weekly and news reports say he is writing a childrens book 
the international committee for the defense of salman rushdie and 
his publishers has gathered the signatures of 12000 people 
including 2500 writers 
in a message to the committee last month rushdie said he 
believed reconciliation with iran was possible 
he said many moslems had written messages of support and there 
is no such unbridgeable gulf between his vision of islam and that 
of moslems who accuse him of blasphemy

a sense of hopelessness has driven a record number 
of east germans across newly porous borders to the west this year 
private and government agencies who help resettle refugees say 
they expect about 100000 east germans to make it to west germany by 
the end of the year 
the number of despairing east germans climbing crawling and 
catapulting their way across the border has swelled to a rate 
unparalleled since the flood of escapees 30 years ago that exodus 
was dammed by the construction of the berlin wall on aug 13 1961 
and those braving the heavily fortified borders are now joined by 
a new breed of escapees who obtain legal permission to travel abroad 
then refuse to return 
it is a sense that grows stronger each day among east germans 
that they have no hope no perspectives for better days as long as 
the current regime is in power said rainer hildebrandt director 
of the august 13th society that aids east german refugees 
the fact that 50 percent of those escaping now are under the 
age of 24 is testimony to the general despair felt there 
about 10000 east germans with legal tourist visas have sought 
asylum in west berlin so far this year and at least 70000 legal 
emigres are expected by the end of the year 
a west german official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
at least 200 east germans are seeking asylum at west german 
embassies in hungary czechoslovakia and east berlin 
we advise against this method as there are continuing dangers 
involved and there is simply no way to accommodate people at the 
representations the official said 
in budapest hungary where an estimated 130 east germans are 
seeking refugee status and access to west germany authorities have 
hinted that they may recognize a right to asylum but no decisions 
have been made 
west germanys deputy minister for intergerman relations walter 
priesnitz said recently that east germans should not try to leave 
without proper documents through hungary which also has a communist 
government 
in the course of democratic reform hungary has dismantled nearly 
half of the 160mile barbedwire border separating it from the west 
officials in austria have been approached for help by 237 east 
germans who fled across the border since the hungarians began 
dismantling the barbed wire in may but they estimate up to six 
times that number have gone directly to the west german embassy in 
vienna after arriving via hungary 
judith toth the hungarian interior ministry official responsible 
for refugee affairs has said a special refugee camp will be erected 
in budapest for those seeking asylum but until then those seeking 
refuge at the west german embassy now may be forced to return to 
east germany 
detlef kuehn president of the institute for intergerman affairs 
in west germany told the associated press that the west german 
government advises east germans to seek legal means of emigrating 
but he acknowledged that the majority of applicants must wait years 
it is hopelessness that is driving so many here kuehn said 
there are no limits on the number of east germans that we will 
take in but we have no interest in depopulating east germany 
one east berliner who did not want his name used said east 
germans are turning to hungary as an escape route because the 
prospects for reform in their own nation seem ever dimmer as erich 
honecker remains the communist party leader 
erich honecker is apparently a very healthy man and as long as 
he is alive we will have the status quo he said 
but right now we have a terrible situation because nobody knows 
what the reality is it is naivete and wishful thinking that makes 
people seek help in another socialist country 
east german officials declined the discuss the isssue 
these matters remain very sensitive as you know said herman 
thost a foreign ministry official in east berlin who deals with 
press relations 
honecker has told visiting west german officials his government 
has repealed longstanding orders to shoot those trying to escape 
except in cases where other lives are threatened no shootings have 
been reported since february despite a rising rate of escapes 
the august 13th society calculates that at least 189 east germans 
were killed in failed escape attempts since the berlin wall was 
built 
at least 350 escapes have been recorded this year up to midjuly 
over the wall and across the heavily fortified borders with the rest 
of west germany

baseball pitcher dave dravecky not only made 
a dramatic comeback from cancer surgery last week his stirring 
victory has helped a 6yearold boys fight against leukemia 
its just wonderful said isabelle lemon of radio station 
knbr which sponsored the fundraiser that generated more than 
85000 to pay for tests of 1133 potential bone marrow donors we 
expect to get more 
while making his return to baseball with the san francisco giants 
last thursday dravecky urged donors to come forward for alex 
vlahov alex whose chances of survival depend on quickly locating a 
suitable marrow match was at candlestick park for the game 
knbr offered to donate 5 for each of the 92 pitches thrown by 
dravecky against the cincinnati reds in his 43 comeback win 
we were deluged by callers pledging similar donations lemon 
said the 1500 donations ranged from a check for 80 cents from a 
child who took the money from his weekly allowance to 8813

an systems analyst who had checked into 
a psychiatric center was indicted wednesday on charges of 
sodomizing sexually abusing and torturing young boys and filming 
some of the acts for sale a prosecutor said 
harold hotchkiss 45 of ossining was charged in a 209count 
indictment with various counts of sodomy sexual abuse use of a 
child in a sexual performance promoting a sexual performance by a 
child obscenity attempted aggravated sexual abuse and endangering 
the welfare of a child 
westchester county district attorney carl vergari said the 
alleged abuse occurred between 1984 and 1989 and involved 10 boys 
between the ages of seven and 17 
there was anal and oral sodomy shock treatments and 
beatings said vergari 
apparently hotchkiss was friends with the family of one boy and 
one thing led to another a friend introduced a friend introduced 
a friend 
vergari also said that he approached young boys who were 
susceptible 
three of the victims were brothers vergari said he would not 
disclose whether the boys received any kind of payment for their 
activities 
jeanine ferris pirro chief of the district attorneys domestic 
violence and child abuse bureau said hotchkiss photographed and 
audiotaped the acts for sale and distribution so authorities do 
not have all the film hotchkiss allegedly took 
hotchkiss allegedly made the children perform acts with him and 
with each other and he allegedly beat the boys and used shock on 
them 
pirro said authorities were notified of the activities when the 
mother of one of the boys found something in her home she would 
not disclose what it was vergari said there was a possibility that 
there were more victims 
the alleged abuse occurred in the ossiningpeekskill area where 
hotchkiss has lived for many years much of the abuse occurred 
within hotchkiss home said vergari 
hotchkiss who is single voluntarily checked himself into the 
institute of living in hartford conn a few months ago pirro said 
authorities would not disclose why he checked himself into the 
facility or whether his arrest wednesday occurred there 
his attorney frank silverstein asked westchester county court 
judge kenneth lange to allow his client to undergo psychiatric 
tests lange agreed and hotchkiss was remanded to the forensic unit 
of the westchester county jail no bail was set

its lush and lovely and delightful 
to behold but the enchantment of purple loosestrife is fast growing 
old 
the bushy garden flower is invading delicate wetlands from coast 
to coast choking out native plants and driving away the birds and 
animals that lived among them 
although loosestrife has been on the loose since the 1800s 
biologists havent recognized the damage until the past five years 
its a very pretty plant until you realize what its done 
said howard wandell with michigans department of natural resources 
in lansing in some of our game areas it is creating habitat 
problems 
at this time of year the hardy european marsh plant is in peak 
purple bloom across the northern united states 
its so beautiful its hard to be angry with it said 
stephen hight a us department of agriculture researcher in 
beltsville va in new york you just see fields of purple haze 
its just gorgeous 
although product researchers at dow chemical co are 
experimenting with a selective herbicide called garlon that could 
kill loosestrife hight and other usda researchers hope to import 
predators for the imported pest 
the study centers on three european beetles that eat nothing but 
loosestrife 
hight said the usda will be ready within two years to release the 
insects in test fields in seven states new york iowa nebraska 
minnesota wisconsin indiana and illinois 
it would take five to 10 years for the bugs to breed in enough 
numbers to take on the whole continent if they thrive and eat 
right the beetles could cut the purple fields of loosestrife to a 
fourth of their current density and hold it there hight said 
wednesday 
we find that in invaded areas the native plants some of them 
endangered species are just barely hanging on this could allow 
some of these native plants to come back in he said 
until then fighting loosestrife is a statebystate battle 
minnesota and washington have outlawed the plant banning it even 
in home gardens still it has claimed more than 1 percent of 
minnesotas 25 million acres of wetland said jay rendall of the 
minnesota department of natural resources 
i personally have witnessed how fast it spreads rendall 
said i watched one 50by100foot patch spread to cover a 20acre 
march in about three years 
loosestrife replaces cattails and rushes in which waterfowl nest 
when the plant moves in ducks move out followed by muskrats and 
other animals rendall said 
wisconsin prohibits the sale of all species of loosestrife and 
indiana ohio and illinois place restrictions on the plants sale 
some states including new york and michigan have enacted no 
antiloosestrife laws rendall said in both states the infestation 
is so severe it would cost too much to even begin battling the weed 
he said 
yet loosestrife holds a peculiar attraction in michigan where 
rendall estimates it has taken over more than 30000 acres of marsh 
and swamp about the same as in minnesota 
it is a very pretty plant so a lot of people here were 
promoting its growth wandell said garden clubs even had some 
cities name their city flower the purple loosestrife

while claude pepper lived his office was a 
fiveroom suite among the best on capitol hill with pepper gone 
and no successor in place his staff is winding up his work in two 
dingy storerooms with an air shaft for a view 
our quarters are so cramped we figured the animal rights 
people would be protesting says rochelle jones longtime press 
secretary for the florida congressman 
the experiences of peppers staff undoubtedly differ little from 
those of reps jim wright and tony coelho who resigned and mickey 
leland and larkin smith who were killed in recent plane crashes 
pepper the champion of the elderly enjoyed the power and perks 
that grow with seniority and his staff shared them too when he 
died the perks died for his staff as well 
when a member dies its over with says ray colley the 
deputy clerk of the house who supervises the transitions when a 
congressman leaves and another takes his place 
when pepper staffers returned from his funeral in june there was 
a message from the clerks office the telephone should no longer be 
answered congressman claude peppers office it was to be 18th 
congressional district of florida 
about the same time recalls ms jones a procession of 
congressmen and their staffs came by to look over peppers office 
which was in a prime location in the rayburn office building 
commensurate with his 27 years in the house 
they were really ghoulish people looking over the remains 
says ms jones five different people put in a bid for the 
office 
when congressional suites become vacant other members bid on 
them and they are awarded on the basis of seniority 
the visitors included congressmen and others who wanted 
postdeath autographs on books and pictures before the automatic 
signing pen was put away 
i can understand the staffs concern about not being able to 
answer senator pepper but hes not senator pepper any more 
colley said many oldtimers on capitol hill still referred to 
pepper as senator since he served in the senate for 14 years 
some of the pepper perks were gone before the sun set on his 
grave 
i had a parking space in rayburn that was just great a few 
steps from the elevator said ms jones one day i came in and 
found texas congressman jack brooks using my parking space it was 
my notification that the space was no longer mine 
pepper died may 30 at age 88 the funeral was june 5 in florida 
his congressional seat will be filled in a special election aug 29 
but until then his staff takes care of district business 
at the end of june the pepper staff was told to move into two 
rooms among storage spaces on the sixth floor of the longworth house 
office building next door with a view of an air shaft 
the move meant packing up the congressmans belongings first for 
the office switch then for transfer to the federal records center 
pepper was in office from 1962 he never threw away a piece of 
paper said ms jones i found personnel files of people who 
worked there in the 1960s 
the rayburn office was filled with memorabilia it was a living 
museum pictures of pepper with all the presidents hes known since 
roosevelt pictures of pepper with celebrities one wall was filled 
just with legislation he had participated in from the crossflorida 
barge canal to social security reform 
peppers personal things including the hundreds of pictures and 
dozens of pens from bill signings will go to the mildred and claude 
pepper library at florida state university in tallahassee 
peppers office was assigned by the clerks office to rep dale 
kildee dmich who is in his seventh term 
we are very careful to answer the phone 18th congressional 
district of florida said ms jones there is usually a pause 
then is this congressman peppers office people still call up 
they need help getting a visa a yearold medicare claim hasnt been 
paid 
the staff toils on winding up the pepper era 
people have stopped answering our phone calls ms jones said 
that in washington is the ultimate loss of power

official us displeasure over the chinese 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement is putting a damper on 
departing ambassador han xus farewell to washington 
the most prominent americans among about 500 guests at hans 
chinese embassy reception wednesday night were retired rather than 
active public officials 
they included two former secretaries of state henry kissinger 
and alexander haig and two former senate leaders republican hugh 
scott and democrat mike mansfield also there was former democratic 
sen j william fulbright 
the absence of top members of president bushs administration and 
cabinet reflected the presidents postjune 3 policy of balancing 
us public outrage over the killings of chinese prodemocracy 
demonstrators against the decision to continue dialogue with the 
chinese government 
under that policy the administration decided that the highest 
representation at hans reception would be at the assistant 
secretary level said a state department official who insisted on 
anonymity from the department came richard solomon assistant 
secretary for east asian and pacific affairs ivan selin 
undersecretary for management and some lower level officials 
earlier in the day the 65yearold ambassador made a farewell 
call on vice president dan quayle their meeting was cordial and 
they talked about ways china could improve its relations with the 
united states human rights were obviously mentioned said 
quayle spokesman david beckwith 
han also made official farewell calls on at least four members of 
the bush cabinet and some members of congress all conspicuously 
absent wednesday cabinet members often attend diplomatic 
receptions and they appeared at the chinese embassy during the 
heyday of hans four upbeat years of expanding relations with the 
united states 
but us officials say those times are over unless china halts 
repression of its citizens 
han xu and his wife ge qiyun smilingly greeted all the guests 
at the entrance to two reception rooms filled with hot and cold 
chinese appetizers and drinks ranging from tea to whiskey the 
couple showed they have made some warm friends the ambassador 
embracing several americans including haig while ms ge exchanged 
kisses with some of the female guests 
haig a retired fourstar general accompanied president nixon on 
his 1972 beijing journey breaking the ice on uschina relations 
han then chief of protocol was one of the first officials to greet 
them haig has visited china several times 
scott 88 attended the reception in a wheelchair he recalled 
his first visit to china before world war ii mansfield who last 
year completed a record 11 years as ambassador to japan was known 
in congress as an old asia hand who advocated us recogniion of 
the communist government long before many other lawmakers he first 
visited asia as a navy sailor 
beijing television on july 6 said han xus term was up and he 
would be succeeded by vice foreign minister zhu qizhen han will 
leave for beijing later this month and the new ambassador is 
expected in midoctober chinese officials said

pw bothas bitter exit from 
the presidency three weeks before parliamentary elections may help 
farright candidates at the expense of the national party he served 
for a halfcentury 
the conservative party which claims the nationalists are 
capitulating to blacks quickly incorporated bothas stern farewell 
speech monday into its campaign rhetoric 
we support mr pw botha in his viewpoint which has been our 
viewpoint all along said conservative party leader andries 
treurnicht at a campaign rally after bothas nationally televised 
address 
botha denounced a planned meeting between national party leader 
fw de klerk and president kenneth kaunda of zambia on grounds the 
outlawed african national congress guerrilla organization has its 
headquarters in zambia botha said his cabinet ignored his 
opposition to the meeting 
yet botha and his predecessor john vorster had met with kaunda 
and the circumstances of the anc were no different then 
one conclusion is that mr botha was using the kaunda talks as 
a stick with which to beat mr de klerk not because of any 
objection in principle but because he was blinded by personal 
antipathy for the man who succeeded him said patrick laurence a 
political writer for the star newspaper in johannesburg 
de klerk was installed as acting president on tuesday 
the way botha chose to do this tarring de klerk with the anc 
brush it is clear he wanted to do as much harm to de klerk as he 
could said steven friedman a researcher at the independent south 
african institute of race relations 
friedman suggested botha had grown more conservative in recent 
years 
he had come to the end of the line as far as reform is 
concerned he was increasingly querulous and felt he hadnt gotten 
credit particularly from the outside world for the major reforms 
he did initiate said friedman 
by proceeding with the kaunda meeting de klerk could win over 
some voters who might have backed the liberal democratic party but 
the greatest threat to nationalists in the sept 6 elections appears 
to be from the conservatives who say the anc has no role to play 
ever in south africa they also call for reimposing apartheid laws 
botha repealed 
it was bothas foreign policy that treurnicht agreed with not 
the retired presidents belief that whites must share power with the 
black majority 
at a minimum the resignation saga has damaged the image of 
stability developed by the national party since taking power in 1948 
for the last 40 years the national party has appeared to be 
entirely in control incidents like this conflict dont do much for 
that kind of image said friedman 
treurnicht a member of bothas cabinet who broke away in 1982 
over the issue of allowing indians and people of mixed race into 
parliament lost no time in decrying the national partys lack of 
unity 
botha who became prime minister in 1978 built up a personal 
image as a defender of white particularly afrikaner interests 
even if people found it difficult to be fond of him most white 
voters english and afrikaansspeaking trusted him on security 
matters his suggestion that de klerk is making a major error on 
that front may be taken seriously 
on the personal level many white voters feel sorry for botha 
the reaction in street conversations and radio talk shows indicates 
the cabinet is seen as bullying a sick albeit cantankerous old man 
into a humiliating resignation instead of smoothing things over 
until the election 
such sentiments may not translate into a loss of support for the 
national party but the conservative party is not missing any chance 
from the first hint of the dispute treurnicht has lamented 
bothas treatment by the cabinet and called the resignation a 
palace revolution 
although afrikaners the whites most likely to vote 
conservatively may sympathize with botha they also believe 
strongly in group loyalty they may begin to frown on bothas 
turning against the party he served for 53 years 
beeld an afrikaanslanguage daily that supported botha for many 
years said the last image that will linger is that of a 
blind samson who with his last strength tried to overturn the 
pillars of his party on himself and his own companions

babies may learn to crawl and walk a little slower 
if their mothers drink while nursing according to a study released 
today that suggests even small amounts of alcohol in breast milk can 
affect development 
while the results are troubling experts caution that there is no 
clear proof that nursing mothers will harm their babies if they 
drink moderately 
i would not worry about drinking during lactation until this 
finding has been confirmed in at least one more study said dr 
ruth e little principal author of the research report 
even if their babies are slow to walk she said mothers should 
not blame their occasional drinking because babies normally vary in 
when they learn these skills 
doctors routinely caution women to avoid alcohol during pregnancy 
because of the potentially dangerous effects of drinking on the 
growth of their fetuses the results of the new study raise the 
possibility that this taboo should be extended into early childhood 
if babies are breastfed 
the research found that the development of movement skills but 
not intelligence was slightly retarded in the babies of nursing 
women who had one or more drinks a day 
these babies are a little slower to walk to crawl and to have 
other motor skills said little an epidemiologist at the 
university of michigan 
she and other researchers looked at more than 100 possible 
factors that could have explained the slower development these 
included the womens age intelligence and drug use during 
pregnancy but only drinking while breast feeding was clearly 
associated with slower motor development 
the study published in the new england journal of medicine was 
based on tests conducted on 400 infants who were born to members of 
a health maintenance organization in seattle 
i think its provocative but the potential mechanism is very 
difficult to understand since the actual alcohol exposure 
experienced by these children is minimal commented dr robert 
sokol head of the fetal alcohol research center at wayne state 
university in detroit 
during pregnancy alcohol consumed by the mother crosses the 
placenta and alcohol levels in the fetus are similar to those in 
the mothers bloodstream after birth however only tiny amounts of 
alcohol get into breast milk 
for instance if a 130pound woman has four drinks onehundredth 
of an ounce of the alcohol will reach her baby through breast milk 
even if the mother drinks this heavily every day for three months 
the child will still take in less than an ounce of alcohol 
the researchers cannot explain how even lower alcohol exposure 
might affect babies development they said one possibility is that 
babies cannot eliminate alcohol from their bodies so it builds up 
and interferes with brain development 
the doctors used a test called the bayley scales of infant 
development to check babies mental and motor growth at 1 year of 
age motor development was lower in babies regularly exposed to 
alcohol in breast milk and the higher their alcohol intake the 
slower their motor growth 
the infants of breastfeeding mothers who had at least one drink 
a day had mean scores on the test of 98 while those exposed to less 
alcohol had mean scores of 103 the difference was a bit greater 
when the researchers compared only babies whose mothers did not 
supplement their diets with formula 
lyn weiner program director of the fetal alcohol education 
program at boston university school of medicine noted that 
pediatricians sometimes recommend that nursing mothers drink some 
beer to help start the flow of milk 
women have been doing it for generations she said i think 
its probably of no effect in the healthy woman 
however she said the results do raise concern about women who 
drink heavily while nursing

hearings are to begin next month on legislation 
to get the agriculture department more involved with the 
environmental protection agency on pesticide decisions 
a key feature of the measure sponsored by rep george brown 
dcalif would amend existing statutes to require the agriculture 
department to report annually to epa on which pests are attacking 
crops and the chemicals or other methods being used to control them 
it also would require usda to say which pests are developing 
resistance to products said skip stiles staff director of browns 
house agriculture subcommittee on department operations research 
and foreign agriculture 
the idea he said is to set off an early warning system if epa 
is starting to eliminate all the pesticides used for certain crops 
so alternatives can be developed 
the department of agriculture doesnt get involved in these 
regulation decisions until it is too late to do anything about it 
stiles said 
he gave as an example the case of ethylene dibromide suspended 
by the epa in 1984 after more than seven years of review it was 
used among other things as a fumigant against fruit flies on 
imported produce most specifically mangoes 
a relatively simple alternative eventually was discovered but it 
took three years to move through the government approval process 
from the time ethylene dibromide was taken off the market he said 
the agriculture department stiles said could have been working 
all along to find the alternative that would have been ready when 
ethylene dibromide was canceled 
charles smith usda pesticide research coordinator said the 
department was aware of the epa review but never knew what the 
agencys decision would be 
at the end of the seven years you can look back and say why 
didnt you do something and we say we didnt know what we were 
supposed to do smith said 
he said the department has to ask how many million dollars of 
taxpayers money should i spend to find an alternative to something 
that may stay on the market 
but smith said that doesnt mean the department isnt 
constantly doing research on pest control 
finding chemical alternatives is not what we generally think of 
as the area we think federal money is best spent smith said 
adding that the chemical industry usually shoulders that burden 
he said the government is doing extensive biotechnical research 
and that federal and university researchers generally do the kind of 
work thats not profitable for private industry because its 
highrisk 
just because a chemical is under review by the epa doesnt mean 
it will be canceled he said 
epa has been reluctant to share any information until they are 
certain there is a problem and then sometimes it is way down the 
road smith said 
stiles said the major part of browns bill is devoted to 
procedures for canceling pesticides 
the big complaint has been the epa takes forever to cancel a 
pesticide he said part of the delay is the fact that they have 
cumbersome administrative hearings 
the bill stiles said would eliminate some of those hearings

the pentagon says the cost of bringing its 98 
major weapons systems from the drawing board to full production is 
expected to be 8062 billion 19 billion less than thought six 
months ago 
but that figure is sure to fluctuate since congress already has 
attempted to rearrange defense secretary dick cheneys first 
spending plan 
the pentagon issued a congressionally mandated report wednesday 
that offers a snapshot of anticipated overall weapons costs if 
the bush administration budget is followed 
several of the weapons contained in the selected acquisition 
report entered development in 1970 while others are expected to be 
in production beyond the year 2000 as the weapons programs reach 
the final stages of production they are dropped from the report 
the previous report which was released in march and estimated 
costs as of dec 31 1988 predicted the overall cost of the 
pentagons major weapons systems would be 8259 billion 
the report said the 19 billion drop over the past six months was 
due primarily to cheneys attempt to cancel the marines 
troopcarrying v22 osprey tiltrotor plane and halt production on a 
number of items such as the armys ah64 apache attack helicopter 
the oh58d helicopter the navys f14d jet fighter the air forces 
f15e fighter plane and the phoenix airtoair missile which is 
carried aboard f14s 
congress has attempted to restore the osprey to the pentagons 
spending plan for next year its cancellation would have sliced 
234 billion from the pentagons budget the report said 
the report also detailed estimated increases in several programs 
such as the addition of 225 ch53e troop transport helicopters for 
the navy and marines raising the total cost of that program from 
48 billion to 78 billion 
under cheneys plan the choppers were envisioned as the 
substitute for the v22 osprey 
the report said the armys sadarm missile program jumped by 44 
billion to 62 billion due primarily to orders from fiscal years 
1995 through 2002 which had not been recorded in previous reports 
in total the army estimates it will purchase 124145 of the 
antitank missiles 
an increase of 1 billion was logged for the navys ssn21 sea 
wolf submarine program while research development and testing 
drove costs of the air forces small intercontinental ballistic 
missile program up by 22 billion to 53 billion the report 
showed 
the pentagon is required by congress to produce the annual 
selected acquisition report 
it is a review of the total procurement costs of the major 
weapons programs and is designed to provide a broad gauge of how 
well the pentagon is managing its weapons buying 
on wednesday officials released an update of that report which 
summarizes programs that have had cost estimate changes of at least 
5 percent or schedule delays of at least six months 
the cost estimates include research and development for a weapons 
program its procurement and construction costs the total program 
costs reflect actual costs on delivered items as well as 
anticipated costs for future procurement which in some instances 
extend beyond the year 2000 the pentagon report said 
the report released wednesday gave a view of the program costs as 
of june 30

china says it is suspending participation in 
the prestigious fulbright program forbidding an exchange of 
american professors and chinese scholars 
the action comes in the wake of strained relations between the 
united states and china over the communist nations crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
richard ware chairman of the board of foreign scholarships said 
wednesday that the chinese government told the us embassy in

stock brokers will have a harder time 
pressuring new customers into buying lowpriced often risky 
securities known as penny stocks under a new rule adopted by 
the securities and exchange commission 
the rule unanimously approved wednesday requires brokers 
offering certain securities to get the new customers written 
approval before completing the sale 
sec staffers hope it will curb the practice of unsolicited 
telephone stock sales known as cold calling by providing a 
builtin cooling off period for the customer to reconsider his 
or her decision said sarah b ackerson of the sec enforcement 
division 
the rule which takes effect jan 1 comes in response to a 
dramatic rise in the fraudulent sale of penny stocks in the first 
half of the current fiscal year the sec has received 2462 
complaints about penny stock fraud compared with 1510 for all of 
the last year 
john c baldwin president of the north american securities 
administrators association a group of statelevel investment 
regulators said the action puts new obstacles in the path of the 
penny stock firms that use the telephone as a weapon to mug 
unsuspecting investors 
before the 5to0 vote to approve the change sec chairman david 
s ruder said the problem was of great concern to the agency 
last fall ruder created a penny stock task force which found a 
key element of penny stock fraud was highpressure sales tactics 
often over the telephone used on unsophisticated investors 
the new rule ruder said brings us today a weapon against this 
scurrilous conduct a weapon thats effective but not intrusive 
but he and several other commission members also noted most penny 
stocks and penny stock dealers are legitimate 
the sec created several exceptions in response to numerous 
complaints that the proposal would make it tough for new companies 
short of capital traditionally a major segment of penny stock 
issuers to raise money 
the rule would apply to stocks selling at 499 or less per share 
or to stocks issued by companies with less than 2 million in 
tangible assets 
penny stocks trading for a few cents up to a few dollars are 
usually issued by new companies or concerns with an uneven earnings 
history 
they usually are not traded on exchanges or quoted on the 
national association of securities dealers automated quotation 
nasdaq system commonly known as the national overthecounter 
market 
because most penny stocks are not listed nationally information 
about them is hard to come by and fraudulent claims are difficult to 
dispute 
the new penny stock rule first proposed in february will 
require brokers and dealers to get written purchase agreements from 
new customers before completing their first three transactions in 
stocks that are neither traded on stock exchanges nor through the 
nasdaq system 
brokerdealers also would have to get financial information from 
the customer such as income investment experience and investment 
objectives determine whether the transaction is suitable for the 
customers needs and write down the basis for that determination 
exempted were initial public offerings that are scheduled to be 
listed with nasdaq or a stock exchange

the bush administration is demanding that gen 
manuel antonio noriega relinquish power in panama but apparently 
wont insist that he leave the country 
weve always said that he must leave power weve always said 
that there can be no accommodation with a noriegadominated 
regime state department spokesman richard boucher said wednesday 
however boucher declined to say whether noriega under 
indictment in florida on drug charges must leave panama 
the organization of american states resumed talks in panama this 
week with government and opposition forces boucher said the 
administration supports the attempt to achieve a democratic 
transfer of power 
president bush at a news conference tuesday left open the 
possibility of seeking noriegas extradition or even abducting him 
to face trial 
i have an obligation to try to bring people to justice he 
said 
the reagan administration initially demanded that noriega not 
only surrender power but leave panama behind the scenes though 
the united states worked out a deal for the general to leave during 
national elections and to be free to return afterward but without 
power the deal fell apart in 1988 and the administration stopped 
calling for him to leave panama 
last year noriega bought a home in the dominican republic 
raising prospects he could be persuaded to go there however the 
reagan administration scuttled any such deal on the grounds the 
dominican republic was too close to panama

two private groups say the freedom of 
information act entitles them to copies of oliver norths notebooks 
from prosecutors in the irancontra scandal 
the national security archive and public citizen filed suit 
wednesday in us district court asking a judge to order 
independent counsel lawrence walsh to turn over copies of some 3000 
pages of handwritten notes compiled by the former white house aide

administrations iran arms sale initiative and secret support for 
the contras during a congressional ban on military aid to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
north took the notebooks when he was fired in 1986 and was forced 
to give copies of them to walshs office when he took the witness 
stand in his own defense at his criminal trial north was convicted 
on three felony counts 
in a july 24 letter walsh told the archive that ownership of the 
documents is uncertain and denied its request to turn over copies 
according to the lawsuit 
mary belcher a spokeswoman for walshs office declined to 
comment on the lawsuit

administration and congressional sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
we shall supply a copy of these documents to the national 
security council along with a copy of your letter expressing a need 
for them walsh said in a june 23 letter to sen claiborne pell 
dri the foreign relations committees chairman

the national transportation safety board 
reportedly is likely to recommend more frequent and more thorough 
inspections of all dc10 engines as a result of the sioux city 
iowa crash that killed 111 people 
the safety board is fairly certain to make the recommendation 
as a precaution against another explosive engine failure such as the 
one that led to the july 19 crash of united airlines flight 232 abc 
news reported wednesday 
ted lopatkiewicz an ntsb spokesman said he could not confirm 
whether the board was considering a recommendation for increased and 
tougher inspections for dc10 engines 
we dont discuss anything that might be considered or discussed 
until the board votes on a recommendation he said 
nothing in the records for the engine and the plane showed any 
problems or violations of maintenance regulations the network 
reported 
engines on two dc10 passenger jets have suffered explosive 
failure in the past month 
about two weeks after the sioux city iowa crash a northwest 
airlines dc10 made an emergency landing in denver after its no 2 
tail engine apparently began disintegrating in flight 
the federal aviation administration has since formed a 
governmentindustry task force that is examining possible design 
changes in the planes manufactured by mcdonnelldouglas though the 
dc10 is no longer in production mcdonnelldouglas plans a 
derivative the md11 
lopatkiewicz said investigators are still trying to find out what 
caused the engine on flight 232 to fail sending pieces of the 
engine flying and cutting hydraulic control lines 
with pilots struggling to control the aircraft by changing power 
on the remaining two engines the united dc10 with 296 aboard 
cartwheeled into a cornfield while trying to land at sioux city 
significant portions of the fan portion are still missing 
lopatkiewicz said adding that search teams are looking for them 
below the planes flight path 
parts that have been recovered have been taken to the evendale 
ohio plant of general electric the engine manufacturer and are 
being compared with engines produced at the same time

the death toll from fires in the united states hit 
a sevenyear high last year signaling a need for stricter fire code 
enforcement and widespread installation of smoke detectors a trade 
group said 
the national fire protection association said wednesday the 1988 
death toll of 6215 people was up 7 percent over 1987 when there 
were 405 fewer deaths 
the report said steady progress has been made in reducing fire 
deaths this century but since 1982 fire deaths have remained fairly 
constant staying within 4 percent of 6000 every year except 1984 
the implications of the plateau reached by civilian fire deaths 
are clear today as they have been for the last several years the 
report said the steady stream of good news to which we have 
become accustomed will not resume unless we make it 
the figures exclude 62 firefighters who died in the line of duty 
eight years ago the death toll from fires hit 6700 the 
previous high had been 7575 in 1979 said julie reynolds a 
spokeswoman for the nonprofit association based in suburban quincy 
fires caused property damage last year estimated at 835 
billion the report said an increase of 167 percent from 1987 
the report noted that a significant part of the total 56 
percent resulted from large industrial fires at a refinery in 
norco la a chemical manufacturing plant in henderson nev and a 
telephone switching station in hinsdale ill 
fires caused by arson or suspected arson dropped 52 percent to 
99500 in 1988 but the association said the 1594 billion in 
property damage they caused still amounted to nearly a quarter of 
the property loss in structures 
of the 1988 deaths 5065 happened in residential properties an 
increase of 87 percent over the previous year the association 
defines residential properties as one and twofamily houses 
apartments mobile homes hotels and motels 
michael j karter jr the associations senior statistician 
said a combination of education greater use of smoke detectors and 
wider installation of sprinkler systems in residential buildings are 
needed to reduce fire deaths 
karter also called for steps to make home products safer 
including development of childresistant cigarette lighters and 
marketing of cigarettes that go out quickly when they are dropped or 
thrown away 
the association reported that public fire departments responded 
to 2436500 fires last year an increase of 46 percent from a year 
earlier about 30800 people were injured in fires last year the 
association said 
the report noted that wildfires sharply increased last year with 
675500 brush and grass fires an increase of more than 22 percent 
over 1987 the drought that struck much of the country last summer 
was blamed for most of that increase 
the association arrived at its figures by sampling 2948 fire 
departments including all departments that protect communities of 
100000 or more

the troubleplagued jury in the night 
stalker murder trial began deliberating anew after an alternate 
replaced a slain juror to ponder the fate of richard ramirez 
attorneys for the 29yearold drifter failed in their attempt to 
suspend deliberations for a week but they did not move for a 
mistrial wednesday they said they wanted to research the law on the 
unusual developments that have rocked the trial 
the law is scant on this issue defense attorney ray g clark 
said adding that he would like to see the jurors reach verdicts 
i like the jury he said so personally im not crazy about 
a mistrial 
defense attorney daniel hernandez said he was contemplating a 
motion asking that each juror be polled about their feelings after 
the killing of phyllis singletary 30 who was found beaten and shot 
monday she had been working with the other jurors for a year 
ms singletarys livein boyfriend james melton later committed 
suicide and left a note saying he killed her over a domestic dispute 
please understand that none of this had anything to do with 
whether mr ramirez is guilty or innocent of these charges 
superior court judge michael tynan told the jurors 
we must get on with the task that life has given us he told 
them no matter how deeply you feel about her death it is in no 
way connected to the case of richard ramirez 
ramirez from el paso tex is charged with 13 serial murders 
and 30 related felonies in a summer 1985 rampage that terrified 
southern california 
i have an objection he shouted in court wednesday then 
uttered an obscenity indicating he thought the trial was messed up 
tynan allowed jurors to start deliberating afresh after the jury 
foreman felipe rodriguez said panelists had calmed down after 
reacting tearfully to ms singletarys death on tuesday 
everyone appears to have put it behind them he said 
but clark told the judge i believe a cloud hangs over the jury 
now a cloud of sadness his motion to suspend deliberations for a 
week was denied 
the jurors have been together since the trial began with jury 
selection a year ago testimony took six months clark said he 
believes jurors in such a long trial become closer than siblings 
and would be deeply affected by the death of one member 
the attorney said he feared jurors would vent their anger over 
ms singletarys death on ramirez 
hes the only target they have he said 
it was the third time the jury had to make a fresh start last 
week after 13 days of talks another juror had to be replaced by an 
alternate for sleeping during deliberations

gov buddy roemer commuted the death 
sentence of a man convicted of stabbing his landlady to death while 
her children watched although the governor said he did not believe 
the mans claim of innocence 
ronald monroe 34 who was to have died in the electric chair 
aug 30 will spend the rest of his life in prison without parole 
roemer said wednesday 
two different juries sentenced monroe to death for the 1977 fatal 
stabbing of lenora collins in her new orleans home her children 
who were 11 and 12 at the time testified that monroe was the 
murderer 
roemer met for nearly three hours wednesday with defense 
attorneys prosecutors and theodise collins now 24 who said again 
she was sure monroe was the murderer 
nevertheless roemer said information that has surfaced since the 
conviction casts enough doubt on the case to waive the death 
sentence he cited defense claims that lenora collins was killed by 
her exboyfriend plus the fact that monroe had no criminal record 
and lived next door to collins for years without violence 
in an execution in this country the test ought not be 
reasonable doubt the test ought to be is there any doubt roemer 
said 
he met the test for guilty but not execution the governor 
said 
monroe who has insisted he is innocent for more than a decade 
has labelled by his lawyers as borderline mentally retarded 
defense attorneys said collins exboyfriend george stinson 
admitted committing the murder in 1980 and had intimidated her 
children into identifying monroe as the killer they said he had a 
history of stabbing women and intimidating witnesses 
none of those allegations were heard at monroes trials defense 
lawyer douglas morris said 
however the 5th us circuit court of appeals said last year 
that there was no evidence to back up the defense claims 
the panel noted that stinson was given immunity and testified at 
a special hearing that while serving time in michigan for fatally 
stabbing his commonlaw wife he told a cellmate that lenora collins 
died in a similar fashion but he did not say or imply that he 
personally had any guilt in her death the court said 
theodise collins talked to reporters wednesday after meeting with 
roemer but before he commuted the sentence she said she would not 
be angry if the governor spared monroes life even though she felt 
he should die 
he has a job he has to do she said of roemer 
no governor has commuted a death sentence in louisiana since the 
u s supreme court lifted its ban in the 1970s eighteen have died 
in louisiana including three during the last 17 months that roemer 
has served as governor

managers of a maryland nuclear plant whose 
performance has plummeted ignored warnings that complacency was 
jeopardizing safety the owners chief executive told federal 
regulators 
george mcgowan chairman of baltimore gas amp electric co said he 
had told supervisors at the calvert cliffs plant on chesapeake bay 
that he saw a slippage setting in that threatened the plants 
reputation for efficiency and safety 
im not so sure they believed what i had to say mcgowan on 
wednesday told members of the nuclear regulatory commission 
the nrc last december declared calvert cliffs one of the nations 
worstrun plants and intensified monitoring of its operations 
the commissioners summoned mcgowan and the utilitys other top 
officers to find out how calvert cliffs had fallen to the bottom of 
the performance pile after long being considered one of the bestrun 
plants in the country 
the plants sudden fall from grace has raised new questions about 
the nrcs ability to detect drops in plant performance levels before 
serious accidents occur 
both of calvert cliffs nuclear reactors were shut down last may 
because of mechanical problems a series of earlier mishaps at the 
plant culminated in the accidental death last september of an 
employee who drowned in a water storage tank

transportation secretary samuel skinner is 
asking the senate to move swiftly to ratify a 14yearold treaty 
that would increase compensation for victims of international air 
accidents 
skinner in a letter to the senate foreign relations committee on 
wednesday said the bombing last december of pan american world 
airways flight 103 serves to highlight the gross injustices that 
exist because current treaty provisions limit compensation to 
75000 
the senate has wrestled with the compensation question for more 
than a decade 
in 1975 the united states signed the socalled montreal 
protocols to the warsaw convention which would allow an increase in 
compensation for international air accidents by establishing 
supplemental compensation plans 
while the foreign relations committee twice has recommended the 
montreal protocols be ratified the senate has failed to do so 
because of criticism that proposed plans still did not provide for 
enough compensation to international air travelers 
last year the transportation department offered a revised 
supplemental compensation plan it cast aside the proposed maximum 
compensation of 317000 and proposed an essentially unlimited 
recovery plan per passenger that would be subject only to an overall 
limit of 500 million per accident 
the awards would come from a special fund established through a 
5 per passenger fee on round trip tickets for international air 
travel 
but the senate never held hearings on the proposal before 
adjourning

businesses are breathing uneasily as they face 
the daunting task of complying with an antismog strategy designed 
to clean up the nations dirtiest air and transform the california 
lifestyle 
the plan is so encompassing and so broad in its scope that we 
dont really know yet what the financial implications are as we go 
into the next century said robert raskin of owensbrockway corp 
a glass bottle maker with california plants in vernon and pomona 
the plan adopted this week aims to bring the nations smoggiest 
air into compliance with federal laws by the year 2007 a process 
drawing interest from the bush administration other states japan 
and europe 
but it is the scope of the plan a 45volume collection of 
documents that stands nearly 3 feet high that has drawn concern 
from businesses throughout one of the nations premier manufacturing 
centers 
proposals outlined in the plan would change the way companies do 
business government agencies operate and how people live and play 
in los angeles orange san bernardino and riverside counties for 
example 
sales of barbecue starter fluid a petroleum distillate that 
contributes to ozone would be banned in favor of cleaner 
alternatives such as electric charcoal starters and tins of jellied 
alcohol 
dry cleaners would be required to use equipment that prevents 
fumes from perchloroethylene a dry cleaning chemical that 
contributes to smog from leaking into the air about 1760 dry 
cleaners use the chemical 
outboard and inboard engines for recreational boats sold in the 
region would have to meet tougher air pollution control standards 
banks and fastfood restaurants would be required to reduce the 
time automobiles spend idling in drivethrough lines idling motor 
vehicles account for much of the carbon monoxide pumped into the air 
each day 
one particular worry among business executives however is the 
uncertainty inherent in a strategy intended to guide regional air 
quality regulators for the next 18 years 
owensbrockway the bottlemaking firm already is working to 
reduce nitrogen oxides emissions from its gasfired furnaces in 
accordance with the new rules 
it definitely has been a financial burden raskin said 
though he declined to say how much of a burden 
nevertheless he said we regard ourselves as good corporate 
citizens and his company supports the cleanair goals 
at lockheed aeronautical systems co the big impact for us is 
in the area of things like paint and what are called volatile 
organic chemicals said ed faeder lockheeds director of 
environmental protection and safety 
as of now few if any substitutes exist for certain solvents and 
chromiumbased paints specified for the military aircraft lockheed 
builds 
faeder said lockheed and other defense firms are caught between 
antipollution rules and pentagon specifications 
also complicating matters for corporate employers are efforts to 
curb air pollution by lessening southern californians dependence on 
the automobile 
the plan not only proposes new emission standards for cars and 
trucks but outlines new standards for cleanerburning gasoline it 
sets a longrange course for switching to electricpowered cars and 
aternative fuels such as methanol 
traffic reduction is sought in other ways such as ordering 
companies to develop ridesharing programs and developing landuse 
plans that ensure people live closer to their jobs 
but the proposals have invoked the ire of developers and other 
businesses 
our central concern all along has been with the growth 
management control measures that are in this plan said bart 
doyle a lawyer for the building industry association of southern 
california they tend to run roughshod over local control and 
landuse planning measures that already are in effect 
david neumann a first vice president for security pacific bank 
said its too early to tell how well the ridesharing requirements 
will work out but added 
we certainly are taking the regulation seriously

the moon blushed in alabama turned taupe in minneapolis glowed 
orange in maine and texas and disappeared altogether in washington 
during a rare prime time full lunar eclipse that attracted awed 
sky watchers from coast to coast 
clouds spoiled the view for much of the united states but where 
the skies were clear observers reported a spectacular celestial show 
of light and color 
in the nations capital the moon rose as a golden orange tinted 
grayish brown as the eclipse began then winked out altogether as 
the lunar disk swept into the dark inner core of the earths shadow 
i finally saw one disappear said alan fiala a naval 
observatory astronomer who has studied eclipses for 15 years he 
watched from the observatory roof and shook his head in wonder when 
another astronomer noted that thing done disappeared 
a little girl watching with her mother in a park in minneapolis 
also saw it fade from view 
is the moon going to come back tomorrow she asked 
in mobile ala a sky watcher said the moon turned into a 
faintly glowing ball of red clay 
its not flaming red said richard stuefer who watched the 
eclipse with a friend in minneapolis its kind of a taupe 
astronomers at mcdonald observatory near fort davis texas said 
the moon faded to a faint orange glow with a slight tinge of blue 
they fired a laser at the moon repeatedly but said it was too 
dark during the eclipse to aim accurately at their target a 
reflector left on the lunar surface by apollo astronauts 
in portland maine amateur astronomer bill hoyt was elated when 
the moon dimmed to muted orangeneon disk 
its so impressive he said you can see the shadow going 
across the moon in a curve which the greeks correctly interpreted 
to mean the earth is round only a round earth could have a round 
shadow 
ron abbott of the astronomical society of kansas city called the 
heavenly show clearly one of the best eclipses in 15 to 20 years 
the moon is dead in the middle of the earths shadow 
a moonwatching party in richmond va attracted 400 guests but 
clouds sent many of them home disappointed with only a partial 
glimpse 
it was perfect for about five minutes but thats all we saw 
said mary coleman martin were disappointed but were grateful 
we saw it at the halfway point 
cosmos minn a town of 550 with streets named for the planets 
and other celestial bodies didnt stage a moonwatching party 
i guess nobody thought about it said barbara minnick but 
she watched the eclipse anyway and reported i stood on milky way 
avenue which is our main street i can see it good 
there were 150 amateur astronomers on the roof of the museum of 
science in boston who got to see the eclipsing moon but they had to 
look quickly it appeared from behind clouds for a tantalizing 10 
seconds faded from view and then came back for another 40 seconds 
it was eerie and thrilling said mary jane dodge a museum 
employee it was like this real bright white crescent that came 
out of the clouds everyone was just going wow and then it 
disappeared again and everybody said oh 
clouds blotted out the view at harvard college observatory and in 
portland ore philadelphia phoenix cheyenne wyo dallas and at 
other eclipsewatch gatherings around the country rain spoiled a 
moon party planned in central park in new york 
sadly well have to wait for the next good eclipse which may 
be a while said harvard astrophysicist clifford stoll this one 
was a total loss 
give us a rain check said new york city parks commissioner 
henry stern who came to the central park event dressed in a space 
suit as part of the citys celebration of the 20th anniversary of 
man landing on the moon since the moon refused to shine well 
have to come back another day 
hundreds of people gathered atop the griffith park observatory 
just north of downtown los angeles and sky watchers also 
congregated in the mojave desert community of lancaster 
its quite a show said retired marine aviator john 
macwhiter who watched the eclipse in lancaster its a marvel 
lunar eclipses begin when the earths shadow nibbles away at the 
moon to create a grayish veil that slowly drapes the lunarscape 
then the dark heart of the earths shadow blots out the last trace 
of silver and turns the moon a reddish hue 
if there is smoke or haze in the atmosphere as there was in 
washington dc the moon can sometimes disappear from view 
altogether 
but it returns just as it did wednesday night after an hour or 
so a faint crescent first appears and then the lunar disk emerges 
little by little out of the shadow and becomes whole again 
eclipsing colors have ranged from vibrant copperred to a faint 
orange glow shadows on the moon during one lunar eclipse in the 
last century are said to have formed the outline of the african 
continent 
wednesday nights celestial show was the first full lunar eclipse 
visible over north america since dec 30 1982 when viewers had to 
arise in the predawn hours the last american primetime eclipse 
occurring in the evening hours when most people are awake was april 
13 1968 the next full lunar eclipse for americans will be in 
december 1992 
if weather had permitted the eclipse could have been in view of 
more than a billion people the earthmoon alignment put the 
eclipsing events in view of north and south america western europe 
and africa and the antarctic 
lunar eclipses occur when the moon passes through the shadow 
created by the earth blocking the suns light the moon in its 
orbit of the earth usually passes above or below this shadowline 
but it occasionally follows a path that shades it completely for a 
time an event called a total eclipse 
eclipses of the moon occur generally twice a year but many are 
only partial or occur during postmidnight hours and are seen by few 
people

the b2 stealth bomber 
soared 10000 feet over the desert floor but a low oilpressure 
reading forced its second test flight to end several hours early 
air force col richard s couch and northrop corp chief test 
pilot bruce j hinds brought the radarevading aircraft down 
wednesday morning because of the reading officials said 
we dont even know if its a problem yet were concerned with 
it and will have to check it out said 1st lt anu sjaardema an 
air force spokeswoman 
the flight scheduled to last three to four hours began at 729 
am in the mojave desert and ended at 836 am 
the two men were never in danger and the plane did achieve at 
least one objective by flying with its landing gear retracted for 
the first time sjaardema said 
nevertheless couch and hinds obviously would have liked to 
accomplish more she said 
the government already has invested about 224 billion in the 
b2 program and congress has balked at paying more than 500 
million apiece for the 132 bombers the military wants making it the 
most expensive airplane in history 
sjaardema said the big black flying wing went a little bit 
faster and a little bit higher than on the first flight in july 
but air force maj dick cole said later at the pentagon that the 
plane was flown to a maximum altitude of 10000 feet and a maximum 
air speed of 180 knots that is the same elevation and speed as 
during the twohour maiden flight of july 17 
low oil pressure was reported in one of the planes four 
accessory drives each drive is like a transmission connected to 
one of the b2s four engines by a shaft the drives power air 
turbine starters and hydraulic systems sjaardema said 
air turbine starters are used to start engines a northrop 
spokesman said the b2s hydraulics apparently control its landing 
gear but it isnt known if they are used to move flaps and other 
control surfaces as is the case on many planes tech sgt donn 
clarius said there was no failure of the hydraulic system 
it was the second setback in two days for the flying wing 
delays caused by wind and a long list of preflight checks on 
tuesday forced officials to move the test back a day 
the air forces first attempt to fly the plane last month was 
aborted because of a low fuelpressure reading that problem was 
fixed

a study of adopted children showed that being 
raised by a welltodo family or being born to privileged parents 
raised iq scores 
the study is one of the first to clearly separate the effects of 
heredity and environment on iq scores said matthew mcgue a 
behavioral geneticist at the university of minnesota 
its a welldesigned study and the results are clean and 
clear he said wednesday there is an effect of biology and 
there is an effect of rearing circumstances 
the study found that adopted children raised by privileged 
families had iq scores 12 points higher than adopted children raised 
by poorer families 
and adopted children whose parents were privileged had iq scores 
15 points higher than adopted children born to poorer families 
regardless of the status of the families that raised them 
children who had welltodo parents and privileged upbringing 
scored highest of all 
an increase of 12 to 15 points in iq score is actually very 
large mcgue twelve points is comparable to the difference 
between people who go to college and the general population 
the study by christiane capron and michel duyme of the 
university of paris appears today in the scientific journal nature 
along with a commentary by mcgue capron and duyme are on vacation 
this week and could not be reached 
the study does not say anything about the reasons for the 
observed increases in iq for example mcgue said it does not 
explain whether the elevated iqs in the children raised in 
privileged families might be the result of access to better schools 
or more emphasis on reading or a variety of other factors 
similarly it does not explain how the genetic effect might 
operate some researchers believe that some children are born with 
more efficient brains but others argue that some children are 
merely born with say a predilection for reading or some other 
activity that might lead to better intellectual performance 
making a general statement that genes somehow influence mental 
development doesnt get us anywhere said douglas wahlsten a 
behavioral geneticist at the university of alberta in canada but 
if we can point to a specific gene learn how it works what it does 
in the body that knowledge can be helpful it can help us to 
produce a better outcome in development 
researchers have argued for years over the relative importance of 
heredity and environment in determining intelligence 
previous studies attempting to resolve the conflict have 
generally used a broad crosssection of adopted children or twins 
statistical tests were generally used to try to separate the 
relative contributions of genes and environment said jerry hirsch 
a professor of psychology and biology at the university of illinois 
hirsch believes those statistical manipulations are faulty 
they tend to confirm prejudices and theyre not as rigorous as we 
would like them to be he said 
the study by capron and duyme avoided the need for such 
statistical tests by carefully selecting the subjects for study 
said wahlsten 
they looked at 38 children for whom the socioeconomic status of 
the biological parents and the adoptive parents was known the 
strict selection criteria justified the use of small numbers of 
subjects the researchers wrote

attorneys for fired exxon skipper joseph 
hazelwood say his sobrietytest results should be thrown out with 
two of the six charges against him 
in legal motions filed wednesday they also asked to move 
hazelwoods oct 30 trial out of valdez 
the request to suppress results of a bloodalcohol test given to 
hazelwood after the oil tanker that he supervised ran aground march 
24 is based on several arguments including the assertion that the 
test was given illegally 
the approved method for determining blood alcohol in alaska is 
the breathalyzer said attorney ken covell who is assisting 
fairbanks attorney dick madson in hazelwoods defense generally 
speaking you cant force somebody to submit to a bloodalcohol 
test 
hazelwood was not offered a breath test and did not consent to a 
blood test covell said 
hazelwood failed the blood test for sobriety performed about 10 
hours after the accident that occurred early the morning of good 
friday 
the 987foot exxon valdez struck a reef in prince william sound 
and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil the spill was the 
nations worst and is expected to have environmental effects for 
years 
hazelwood of huntington ny faces misdemeanor charges of 
operating a vessel while intoxicated reckless endangerment and 
negligent discharge of pollutants a felony indictment charges him 
with three counts of seconddegree criminal mischief he is free on 
50000 bail 
the motions filed wednesday seek dismissal of the endangerment 
and pollution charges 
essentially the facts alleged even if proven at trial would 
not substantiate a conviction on those charges covell said 
the motion for a change of venue does not specify an alternative 
location but fairbanks would afford capt hazelwood the best 
opportunity to obtain a fair trial covell said 
the state has 21 days to respond to the motions

american bases in the philippines are 
so important to regional security that congress will probably 
support any agreement to allow them to stay a us lawmaker said 
today 
rep dante fascell dfla made the statement during a news 
conference before concluding a fourday visit 
fascell leader of a sixmember delegation and chairman of the 
house committee on foreign affairs said talks with president 
corazon aquino and other officials on the bases made him feel more 
optimistic than i did when i came here 
the us and philippine governments are expected to begin talks 
later this year on whether to extend the lease on the bases 
the lease expires in september 1991 and mrs aquino refuses to 
say whether she supports an extension any extension is subject to 
ratification by twothirds of the 23member philippine senate where 
sentiment against the bases is strong 
fascell said many nations in southeast asia see the presence of 
the usrun clark air base subic bay naval base and the four other 
smaller military installations as essential to stability in the 
region 
all the countries in the pacific basin recognize the importance 
of mutual security and the value of it in this area fascell said 
i dont anticipate that we we would have any great difficulty in 
reaching an understanding 
us officials say the bases are essential to maintaining the 
balance of military power in the far east and protecting sea lanes 
to japan and the newly industralized countries of east asia 
but filipino critics say the bases represent an infringment on 
national sovereignty and contribute to social problems such as drug 
addiction and prostitution 
critics also say the united states regularly interferes in 
internal philippine affairs to keep the bases about 40000 american 
service members civilian employees and military dependents are 
stationed here 
fascells delegation is among three groups of us congressmen to 
visit the philippines this month fascells group also will visit 
indonesia singapore and thailand 
the others in his party are democratic reps sander levin of 
michigan and william richardson of new mexico and republican reps 
william bloomfield of michigan benjamin gilman of new york and ben 
blaz of guam 
on wednesday rep stephen solarz dny who is leading another 
delegation said he hoped the two countries could agree to extend 
the bases if not he said the united states would develop 
operative facilities elsewhere in the pacific

president bush is following the case of anticastro 
militant orlando bosch but wont respond to calls for his freedom 
while the case is in federal court a cubanborn republican 
congressional nominee said 
the president himself brought it up on air force one said 
state sen ileana roslehtinen who flew to miamia on wednesday with 
bush from washington for a luncheon that raised at least 250000 
for her campaign he was well abreast on it 
bush noted that bosch has a hearing next month before a federal 
judge she said presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
bush would not comment on the matter 
hes going to be interested in seeing what the decision is 
going to be ms roslehtinen said 
while the case is in court its not really a presidential 
matter she said if and when that time comes certainly were 
going to call on the president to try to help out 
ms roslehtinen who faces democratic attorney gerald richman in 
an aug 29 special election to replace the late rep claude pepper 
has long urged that bosch 62 be freed she made a similar appeal 
to ronald reagan during his last presidential visit to miami last 
year 
bosch a cubanborn pediatrician was taken into custody by 
federal officers when he returned to this country in february 1988 
he had spent 11 years in venezuelan prisons successfuly fighting 
accusations that he masterminded a 1976 bombing of a cuban airliner 
near barbados killing 73 people 
after reviewing his case the justice department this year 
ordered boschs deportation federal officials have said bosch has a 
long history of terrorist activities including during the 1960s 
when he lived in miami he was convicted in 1968 of firing a small 
artillery weapon at a polish freighter at the port of miami and 
later fled the united states violating his probation 
but his supporters point out that he was acquitted three times in 
venezuelan courts on the cuban bombing they say he is a heroic 
freedom fighter who is a victim of changing us policy 
bosch had the active support of the central intelligence agency 
during his 1960s anticastro exploits which included bombing raids 
over cuba they say 
boschs appeal of the deportation order will be taken up in us 
district court next month

a federal prison near here

research suggesting that an overactive immune 
system may cause headache pain is of limited use in treating the 
estimated one in 20 americans who suffer from it almost daily 
medical experts say 
its interesting but its a curiosity when its comes right 
down to it dr fred freitag associate director of the diamond 
headache clinic in chicago said of findings that link headaches to 
alterations in the immune system 
dr lawrence robbins the suburban neurologist who conducted the 
research said everything we know about headaches fits in with the 
hypothesis that the immune system is involved in some integral way 
we know that people with lupus have an overactive immune 
system and they get many many more migraines than other people 
said robbins head of the robbins headache clinic in northbrook 
lupus occurs when the immune system attacks the bodys own 
connective tissues causing symptoms ranging from a rash to joint 
pain and even death 
we know that steroids cortisone which decrease the immune 
system help migraine headaches very much robbins said wednesday 
and now he said researchers are looking into whether aids 
patients who have a history of migraines get fewer headaches once 
the aids virus depresses their immune systems 
the preliminary results appear to indicate that is happening 
said robbins who has enlisted researchers in four headache studies 
of aids patients 
robbins and two colleagues reported in may that they had analyzed 
the blood of 75 headache patients including sufferers of migraines 
and chronic tension headaches and 32 other people the researchers 
found that the headache patients had 30 percent fewer immune system 
cells of a type known as suppressor cells which slow the bodys 
diseasefighting response 
suppressor cells work in combination with helper cells which 
push the immune system along he said in aids patients the helper 
cells are relatively few in headache patients the helpers are 
relatively many 
in a way you could say the immune system is overactive said 
robbins who reported his findings in the may issue of the journal 
headache and presented them in june at the 31st annual meeting of 
american association for the study of headache in boston 
dr egilius spierings director of the john r graham headache 
centre at faulkner hospital in boston said he believes that even 
though robbins research is sound it is of limited use because 
headaches have many causes 
i dont think this is something that would account for a large 
proportion of the headache suffering we see spierings said in a 
telephone interview 
he said headache causes most often include fatigue caffeine 
consumption atmospheric conditions eye and postural strain 
oversleeping hormonal factors emotional stress and even excess 
pain medication 
i wouldnt know how to place his findings in our current pool 
of knowledge and understanding said spierings 
freitag was skeptical of the findings 
what are we going to do we dont have any tools to help us if 
we could decrease the number of helper cells would that decrease 
the headaches i dont believe it would he said 
i have people in my practice who have aids and who still have 
migraine headaches he said

women who take vitamins before they get pregnant do 
not reduce the risk of birth defects a study concludes 
the research contradicts earlier reports suggesting that women 
who take multiple vitamins before they conceive are less likely to 
have babies with defects of the neural tube which develops into the 
brain and spinal cord 
we found that vitamin use was associated with neither an 
increased nor a decreased risk of neural tube defects wrote the 
authors of the latest study 
the work was conducted by dr james l mills and colleagues from 
the national institute of child health and human development it was 
published in todays new england journal of medicine 
the doctors asked 571 women who had babies with neural tube 
defects whether they had taken vitamin pills or eaten 
vitaminfortified cereal before they got pregnant they were 
compared with 573 mothers of healthy babies and 546 who had babies 
with other birth defects 
the researchers found no difference in vitamin use between the 
three groups 
these results indicate that the use of vitamin supplements by 
american women around the time of conception is unlikely to lead 
to any important reduction in the frequency of neural tube 
defects the researchers wrote 
types of neural tube defects include anencephaly in which babies 
are born without a cerebrum

six workers waiting outside the sejm were 
adamant when they approached a solidarity senator on his way to an 
urgent meeting on who will govern poland 
do something have you seen the price of bread we cant make 
ends meet anymore one told sen lech kaczynski 
lawmakers moved through the corridors of parliament wednesday in 
search of a solution to the protracted political and economic 
crisis and by dawn today a solidarityled governing coalition had 
emerged as a real possibility 
kaczynski urged the workers to have patience and cautioned them 
against staging a strike today 
strikes are the worst thing now he told them as he rushed to 
a meeting of lawmakers from solidarity and two smaller parties that 
are preparing to form a noncommunist coalition 
after a government minister droned too long about the rising 
price of bread and coal a solidarity deputy inquired whether it 
wasnt premature to discuss the government budget when there was no 
government yet 
as interest waned in parliamentary proceedings lawmakers left 
the chamber and resumed speculating would there be a solidarityled 
coalition would the communists accept such a configuration does 
solidarity leader lech walesa want to become prime minister 
many of the politicians who could provide answers stayed away 
from reporters prime minister czeslaw kiszczak huddled with top 
solidarity advisers bronislaw geremek and jacek kuron and voices 
lowered when reporters drew near 
i understand when i dont understand what the communists are 
doing but i dont understand when i dont understand what we are 
doing said one leading solidarity deputy over lunch 
the pace of debate quickened late in the day when solidarity 
lawmakers drew up and approved a resolution calling for a 
noncommunist coalition government the first in the east bloc 
we have to go fast the situation is deteriorating from hour to 
hour kaczynski told a reporter in the corridor 
solidarity has hesitated before taking responsibility for the 
countrys economic crisis but now its lawmakers seem to feel that 
only a government they create will have real public support 
we must take some risks such are the times deputy jaroslaw 
kaczynski told opposition lawmakers 
the solidarity meeting was joined by the independent movements 
two new allies the peasant and democratic parties long allied with 
the communists but now ready to form an opposition coalition 
during the threeway discussion solidarity lawmaker aleksander 
malachowski interrupted a speaker and asked where the communists 
were 
i had the impression that a miracle had taken place that the 
communist party had evaporated from this country he said 
actually they were in another chamber just out of earshot 
debating a resolution on polands participation in the invasion of 
czechoslovakia in 1968 
that debate seemed irrelevant to one communist lawmaker who was 
taking a cigarette break 
i dont know i just dont know its strange very strange 
she said when asked why the 1968 invasion was being debated at such 
a time 
by the way whats going on at the other meeting she asked

shellfire jolted beirut overnight despite 
a fragile lull that followed a ceasefire call by the un security 
council police said today 
statements from both the christian army command and the militias 
allied with syria recognized the ceasefire but rejected conditions 
outlined by their opponents to end the devastating 5month 
confrontation 
a police spokesman said two people were killed and 22 wounded in 
the intermittent exchanges with howitzers and mortars across 
beiruts dividing green line the southeastern mountains and the 
northern flank of the christian enclave 
by police count 774 people have been killed and 2073 wounded 
since march in the confrontation between gen michel aouns 20000 
predominantly christian troops and syrias 40000 soldiers and 
allied lebanese militias 
the police spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
regulations said the latest salvo of howitzer shells was fired by 
syrian gunners from moslem west beirut against the 
christiancontrolled coastline north of beirut at 315 am 
the 130mm sovietmade shells damaged the christian port of 
jounieh but no casualties were reported the spokesman said 
he said syrian and christian snipers manning rooftop nests also 
exchanged fire across the green line separating the moslem and 
christian sectors 
the intensity of the clashes has decreased sharply compared to 
the waves of random shelling before the ceasefire call the 
spokesman said 
one independent observer who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
both sides appeared to be observing a ceasefire of convenience 
they are quietly bolstering their forces 
the syrians and aouns force have been fighting since march 8 
the battle has ravaged beirut in addition to the dead the 
casualties include 2051 wounded six of them wednesday nearly all 
the casualties have been civilians 
the un security council unanimously approved the ceasefire 
resolution tuesday in new york during an emergency meeting called by 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
a spokesman for aoun said wednesday the general 
unconditionally welcomes the un security council resolution the 
resolution as we understand it is a package deal that involves not 
just a ceasefire but also lifting of blockades and programming the 
syrian military pullout from lebanon 
aoun has declared a war of liberation to drive out the syrian 
troops deployed in lebanon under an arab league mandate granted in 
1976 the year after the sectarian civil war began aoun has said 
the syrians lost their mandate as a peacekeeping force when they 
sided with moslems 
the spokesman claimed aouns gunners entrenched in the christian 
enclave were abiding by the ceasefire call but they dont need 
orders to fire back if they were shelled 
an alliance of lebanese leftist and moslem militias backed by 
syria and iran announced a conditional approval of the 
ceasefire call 
in a statement from damascus syria the nationalist front said 
it accepts the call for a ceasefire provided that an 
interlebanese committee be formed to monitor the lebanese coast and 
prevent the delivery of arms shipments to aoun 
the aoun spokesman however said the concept of an 
interlebanese committee is totally rejected by us 
our war has not been with lebanese factions weve been 
fighting the syrians for more than five months and now they want to 
forge facts and say the conflict is between lebanese groups we will 
not accept this at all he said 
the aoun spokesman said the ceasefire call will face a major 
test when any ship tries to dock at our ports if they shell it 
well certainly respond 
druse warlord walid jumblatt syrias closest ally in the 
nationalist front rejected the ceasefire call altogether 
either aoun goes or it is war to the end jumblatt said in a 
statement broadcast by voice of the people radio 
earlier syrian president hafez assad told italian premier giulio 
andreotti he will try to silence the guns in lebanon and promote 
a peace settlement in washington state department spokesman 
richard boucher read a statement that said in part the senseless 
bloodshed has gone on for far too long and it must cease 
druse fighters manning jeepmounted machine guns and recoilless 
cannons were seen in west beirut for the first time since syrian 
troops moved into the moslem sector in february 1987 to stop 
fighting among militias 
the lebanese capital divided into moslem and christian sectors 
has suffered the brunt of the fighting about 90 percent of its 15 
million people have left since the shelling began in march 
the artillery war began two days after aouns forces blockaded 
illegal ports run by moslem militias that deprived the government of 
about 100 million a year in customs revenue

former gov jim hunts decision not to seek 
a rematch against republican sen jesse helms leaves the way open 
for a host of fresh democratic faces to enter the race 
hunt said wednesday he thought he could beat helms but he said 
his mothers poor health persuaded him not to run he also indicated 
he wasnt eager for a replay of his bitter 1984 race against helms 
although he said that wasnt why he was bowing out 
i especially believe i would win if the campaign focused on the 
issues and on the future of north carolina and the nation he said 
in a statement but given the experience of 1984 that probably 
would not be its nature further given the result of 1984 it is 
clear that i do not enjoy or perform very well in a campaign that 
emphasizes negative ads and character attacks 
hunt and helms spent a national record 26 million in a race 
marked by negative campaigning and personal slurs helms won by a 
52to48 percent margin against the backdrop of former president 
reagans landslide reelection win 
helms said he was relieved he would not face hunt 
mr hunt has demonstrated in four elections that he is always a 
formidable opponent helms said in a statement i would be less 
than honest if i did not acknowledge that i was glad to learn of his 
announcement today 
hunt 52 is a partner in a raleigh law firm he served four 
years as lieutenant governor and was the first governor to serve 
successive fouryear terms 
national democratic leaders had been pushing hunt to run again 
former state sen bo thomas the only democrat actively 
campaigning for the nomination welcomed hunts decision saying it 
is not the time or place for him to run thomas said he expected 
other democrats to enter the race

the soviet union will allow thousands 
of koreans living in the soviet far eastern district of sakhalin to 
visit their homeland governing party sources said today 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said rep kim 
hyonwook of the governing democratic justice party is in the soviet 
union discussing procedures for koreans to return to their homeland 
for the first time since world war ii ended in 1945 
thousands of koreans were brought to sakhalin by japan as forced 
labor in the final years of the war they since have been stranded 
there simply because of the lack of diplomatic relations between 
seoul and moscow 
but the two coutries exchanged trade offices this year and the 
soviet union closely allied with communist north korea has shown 
willingess to promote nonpolitical ties with south korea 
officials of the democratic justice party said about 36000 
koreans are living in sakhalin and that about 3000 mostly 
firstgeneration koreans want to return home permanently or at 
least visit 
under an agreement with soviet officials a chartered south 
korean plane may be allowed to bring home several hundred koreans 
before the end of the year the party sources said 
they said the south korean government would pay all travel 
expenses 
the central executive committee of the democratic justice party 
reviewed the issue today and discussed seeking financial 
compensation from japan for the korean residents of sakhalin the 
party sources said

a soviet freighter carrying canadian 
toxic waste intended for incineration in britain sailed from 
liverpool early today with the cargo still aboard after port owners 
refused to unload it 
david boyle of the association of waste disposal contractors said 
the freighter nadezhda obukhova was returning to montreal with its 
cargo of polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs 
the british government had insisted that incineration of the 
waste posed no threat to health and boyle condemned the refusal of 
port owners and dockworkers at the northwest port of liverpool to 
unload it 
there is no reason whatsoever why on environmental grounds 
these cargoes should not be handled environment secretary chris 
patten said wednesday we havent been and were not going to be 
the dustbin of the world 
but greenpeace and other environmental groups that campaigned 
against the waste being brought to britain said the freighters 
departure was a victory 
the ship discharged and loaded some containers but the ones 
holding the pcbs remained on board and the vessel sailed from 
liverpool shortly before dawn 
the pcbs had been destined for destruction in a special 
hightemperature incinerator in south wales 
the mersey docks and harbor co backing dockworker leaders 
refused to handle the cargo after greenpeace succeeded with a highly 
publicized protest in blocking another pcbs cargo at a south england 
port tilbury 
tilbury turned away the shipment also from canada after 
protesters attached a skull and crossbones banner to the freighter 
while television camera crews filmed from media launches and 
helicopters 
british newspapers have taken up the issue with mass circulation 
newspapers carrying headlines such as ship of shame 
londons liberal observer newspaper usually sympathetic to 
greenpeace this week accused the environmental movement of going 
overboard 
its protests are aimed at blocking 15 shipments from canada that 
a british disposal company rechem has contracted to handle at its 
south wales plant the company says it will defend its position 
pcbs were used primarily as a coolant in electrical transformers 
but have been banned in north america because of links to cancer 
government officials argue that britain has the technology to 
dispose of the material and strict safety regulations 
greenpeace spokesman tim birch said wednesday that by allowing 
the imports britain was encouraging the global toxic waste 
crisis 
canadas only incinerator capable of disposing of pcbs is in 
alberta and does not accept wastes from other provinces

a tanker captain was overworked and 
distracted causing the oil spill off newport for which he and a 
shipping company have agreed to pay 510000 in fines a prosecutor 
said 
the captain iakovos georgudis and ballard shipping co each 
pleaded guilty wednesday to one misdemeanor count of violating the 
federal clean water act 
almost 300000 gallons of heating oil flowed from the greek 
tanker world prodigy when it ran aground june 23 on brenton reef at 
the mouth of narragansett bay 
georgudis 43 of athens greece agreed to pay a 10000 fine to 
avoid prison and ballard a liberian company agreed to pay 500000 
to the state for environmental research and land acquisition 
us district judge ernest c torres set sentencing for sept 15 
but reserved the right to reject the pleas if a presentence 
investigation turned up other facts 
us attorney lincoln almond said georgudis became distracted 
and was also doing computations to doublecheck estimates of how 
oil would have to be shifted for unloading 
the ship at some point should have taken a left turn he said 
instead it ran straight onto the rocks 
according to testimony at a us coast guard hearing georgudis 
and a helmsman were on the bridge at the time a harbor pilot was 
preparing to board the ship to guide it through narragansett bay 
he was simply trying to handle more than one person could 
handle at one time said peter dibiase georgudis attorney 
georgudis could have faced one year in prison and he and ballard 
each could have faced fines of twice the damages almond said 
the captain remained free on 50000 bail but restricted to rhode 
island massachusetts and new york city where the ship was repaired 
before it left for greece late last month 
georgudis previously told gov edward d diprete and coast guard 
officials that he made a mistake by not steering the ship away from 
the reef and warning buoys and by not having a harbor pilot on board 
the captain also faces state charges of causing pollution and 
failing to have a harbor pilot on board if convicted of the state 
charges georgudis could be sentenced to more than one year in 
prison and fined 20000 state attorney general james oneil has 
said he would not seek prison time 
claude cote acting legal counsel for the state department of 
environmental management said the state was negotiating a 
settlement for cleanup costs with ballard he said the federal plea 
agreement would not block state legal action 
almond said he decided the state should get the fines because it 
suffered more damage than the federal government 
ballard will pay 250000 to an environmental trust fund some of 
which cote said would be used to develop better oil containment 
booms for ocean work the remaining 250000 would be used to help 
the state acquire coastal property 
the coast guard has estimated cleanup costs at nearly 2 million

a qantas jumbo jet made aviation history 
today by becoming the first commercial airliner to fly nonstop from 
london to sydney 
ending what the pilot called the tyranny of distance the new 
150 million qantas airways boeing 747400 made the 11156mile 
journey in 20 hours nine minutes also setting a speed record 
hundreds of people witnessed the arrival of the city of 
canberra at sydneys kingsfordsmith airport named for sir 
charles kingsfordsmith the australian aviator who pioneered the 
route in 1929 
the previous longdistance record was held by south african 
airways which flew a specially designed boeing jet 10281 miles 
from seattle to cape town 
flights between australia and london currently make one stop and 
complete the journey in about 22 hours 
by contrast a similar journey in the 1930s from london to 
brisbane took 12 to 14 days with stops in paris brindisi italy 
athens cairo karachi pakistan singapore and brisbane 
the city of canberra made the journey with 23 people on 
board as well as strict limitations on luggage it carried 56420 
gallons of highdensity aviation fuel 
qantas said the flight could not have been attempted with a full 
load of passengers so the 367seat jet carried just seven crew 
including four pilots and 16 others including airline executives 
and aviation writers 
its normal range is 7875 miles with a full passenger and cargo 
payload 
on the tarmac hundreds cheered senior pilot capt david 
masseygreen who declared the tryanny of distance has been 
beaten down 
nonessential galley equipment including newspapers were 
removed from the plane it reportedly arrived with only one hours 
worth of fuel in reserve after flying at an average speed of 570 mph 
at an altitude of 45000 feet 
more than half the super jets weight at takeoff was in fuel

wednesdays sentencing followed a night of gang bloodshed that 
left four people dead and four injured such violence coupled with 
rampant drug dealing prompted the city on tuesday to create a 3 
million program to deploy large squads of police in ganginfested 
areas 
the girl whose name was withheld because of her age was 
sentenced in compton juvenile court for the june 2 shooting of 
patricia tawana thomas 14 she was convicted of firstdegree murder 
on aug 3 
despite the heavy sentence as a minor she can be imprisoned only 
until she is 25 
the killer and the slain girl were friends who had belonged to 
the 118th street east coast crips gang but the victims decision to 
change gangs led to a dispute said dennis fuhrman a prosecutor 
assigned to the district attorneys hardcore gang unit 
she armed herself went to the victims house and while waiting 
for her to come outside she told some people standing outside that 
she was gonna smoke the girl furhman said

the food and drug administration is conducting 
new tests of the 30 most prescribed generic drugs responding to 
revelations that some drugs were not properly tested before getting 
federal approval 
if any safety problem arises in either a generic or brandname 
product an announcement and recall will be promptly made the fda 
said wednesday 
the tests come as the result of recent reports that some 
companies substituted the original patented drug for the generic 
drug in tests to win fda approval such a substitution tests the 
original drug against itself almost guaranteeing equivalent 
biological activity 
the agency said it expects to analyze more than 1000 samples 
from hundreds of companies to check potency rate of dissolution in 
the body and chemical composition 
samples will be collected from all manufacturers and 
privatelabel distributors of the 30 drugs the agency said about 
half are already in hand and the tests may take several weeks 
the 30 generic drugs being tested cover about threefourths of 
new prescriptions for generics the agency said 
the announcement followed disclosure that the agencys 
governmental parent the department of health and human services 
has streamlined procedures to deal with serious violations of the 
food drug and cosmetic act 
the health agencys inspector general has been given authority to 
investigate violations something the fda previously handled itself 
the fda has been under pressure from capitol hill especially the 
house energy and commerce investigations subcommittee chaired by 
rep john dingell dmich to clean up the generic drug division 
dingells investigators were the first to uncover the problems at 
the fda division they turned their information over to the us 
attorneys office in baltimore 
prescription drugs must undergo tests that lead to human trials 
to prove they are safe and effective before they can be sold 
new drugs are patented but when patents expire any company is 
free to make the drug several companies frequently compete to sell 
the same product which reduces prices 
the drugs being tested by the fda are generic versions of the 
following drugs 
acetaminophen with codeine allopurinol amitriptyline 
amoxicillin and amoxicillin trihydrate ampicillin cephalexin 
doxycycline hyclate diazepam dipyridamole erythromycin 
erythromycin stearate ferrous sulfate furosemide 
hydrochlorothiazide hydrocortisone ibuprofen 
imipramine lorazepam meclizine metronidazole nitroglycerin

soldiers today began 
turning back palestinians headed to work in israel for failing to 
have the governments new computerized identification cards 
in the occupied west bank troops shot and killed a palestinian 
escapee armed with an uzi submachine gun after he defied an order to 
stop the army said 
the shooting occurred wednesday night near idna a village 20 
miles southwest of jerusalem the army said in a statement the army 
identified the man as shahadi darwish 25 of beit jala and said he 
escaped from jail in may 
he was in detention on suspicion of committing several 
terrorist acts among these the murder of a local policeman in beit 
jala in august 1987 the statement said 
the death raised to 537 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli troops and jewish settlers since the palestinian uprising 
began in december 1987 ninetyfive suspected collaborators have 
been killed by fellow arabs and 38 israelis also have died in the 
violence 
palestinian activists have called for a strike starting friday to 
protest the identification cards which israeli officials say are 
needed to improve security 
the system was announced several months ago after a series of 
slayings and other attacks against israeli civilians by palestinians 
the issue has become primarily a test of strength between the 
armyrun civil administration in the gaza strip and clandestine 
uprising leaders who are trying to sever ties between palestinians 
and israel as part of their revolt against 22 years of occupation 
brig gen arye ramot head of the military government in gaza 
told israel radio today that 5000 gaza workers were allowed to 
enter israel through the erez checkpoint between 330 am and 7 am 
but ramot said about 1000 laborers in 300 cars were turned back 
when spot checks showed they lacked the new identification cards 
he said israel initially estimated that 50000 cards would be 
issued but now believes demand could exceed 70000 
ramot said the cards would increase israels control over the 
people of gaza since their backgrounds could now be checked against 
computer records but he conceded someone who never committed a 
crime before could get the card then carry out an attack in israel 
israeli officials said uprising leaders have confiscated as many 
as 1000 cards and intimidated workers who have tried to acquire 
them 
outside the complex of tents and stucco buildings where the cards 
are issued a 48yearold palestinian father of eight complained he 
had to pay all his back taxes to get the new card and now expected 
it to be taken away 
we get it and the popular committees come and take it so its 
useless said the man who gave his name only as yusef 
according to government figures 110000 palestinians from the 
occupied territories work in israel 50000 from the gaza strip and 
60000 from the west bank 
many hold lowpaying jobs in construction textiles restaurants 
and city sanitation services together their wages amount to about 
700 million a year 
such work is the largest single source of income for palestinians 
in the occupied lands and constitutes a significant portion of the 
13 billion gross domestic product of the territories 
the army earlier announced that effective friday no gazan 
without a new identification card would be allowed to enter israel 
wall slogans in the gaza strip on wednesday ordered workers to 
boycott their jobs in israel for two weeks starting friday 
underground leaders of the uprising said in a leaflet that 
workers in the west bank should strike for a week in solidarity with 
the gazans the leaflet also said palestinians who did not strike 
would be considered betrayers 
israel radio said that many palestinian workers defied strikes on 
tuesday and wednesday and that some may stay in israel to circumvent 
new strike calls and keep their jobs 
many israeli employers have begun trying to replace arab workers 
with israelis for security reasons and to ease israels rising 
unemployment 
the central bureau of statistics said today that estimates for 
april through june put unemployment at 95 percent

a chinese student leader clarifying a statement he 
made the day before at a un human rights panel said today he has 
reliable information that up to 120000 people were arrested since 
the military crackdown in china last june 
some of those arrested li lu said have been secretly 
executed 
li 23 who is on the beijing governments list of most wanted 
criminals for his role in the demonstrations on tiananmen square 
told reporters he has maintained close contacts with sources in 
china since he fled his homeland in late june

li on wednesday became the first student leader to address a un 
body the un subcommission for the prevention of discrimination 
on the june events his appeal to the international community to 
condemn chinas rights policies prompted the official chinese 
observer to walk out in protest 
in his speech li said that since the crackdown many more are 
arrested and executed these may number as many as 120000 
asked about this at todays news conference he said he meant 
that some of these may have been executed but did not give an 
estimate many arrests he said were never publicly announced 
li who studied physics and economics said he was for a short 
time a member of the chinese communist party until 1986 when he 
still thought that reforms could change the system 
now most people realize an inside reform cannot bring hope for 
chinas future he said speaking in halting english in response 
to questions he said he favored limited sanctions by the 
international community against china but cautioned that this was a 
complicated issue 
since his escape he said he has been living in france west 
germany and the united states asked whether he felt threatened 
being on chinas most wanted list he said he did not care 
about dangers and that many people were protecting him 
the official chinese observer zhang yishan told the un panel 
wednesday night that li was one of the major organizers of the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion

indignation and regret at the fact that a criminal wanted by a 
un member state was able to attack that nation at a un forum 
li who said he was the deputy head of the student hunger strike 
committee said wednesday that thousands may have been killed during 
the june 34 military repression china has said at least 200 people 
have died 
the exact numbers will never be known since bodies were carted 
off probably to mass graves others were cremated right where they 
lay he said but the terror did not end with the killings 
amnesty international in a statement released after lis speech 
said the atmosphere of terror following the june crackdown made 
it impossible to say how many were killed 
amnesty has called the government figure a gross 
underestimate

the government today said it was barring 
indefinitely the entry of a bulgarian train that for three months 
has carried an average of 600 ethnic turks daily to this country 
a foreign ministry spokesman murat sungar told the associated 
press that the decision was made to protest the disorderly and 
inhuman transfer of the ethnic turks by the bulgarian government 
sungar said the train was overcrowded and the immigrants 
belongings were sent three days later 
he added that turkey could review its decision if the bulgarian 
government agrees to make the transfers in a more orderly and humane 
way 
the decision does not mean that turkey closes its border with 
bulgaria sungar said 
the exodus continued today with more immigrants crossing the 
border by private cars the number of immigrants who have arrived in 
turkey so far has reached 291500 
in may bulgaria began deporting ethnic turks after subjecting 
them to a forced assimilation campaign that included changing their 
turkish names to slavic ones and banning islamic rites and use of 
the turkish language 
the deportation grew into an exodus as the ethnic turks were 
permitted to acquire passports and leave the country 
bulgaria refuses turkeys call for talks on an immigration 
agreement that would protect the ethnic turks legal rights 
including social security benefits and compensation for property 
left behind and restoration of minority rights to those who remain 
in bulgaria

the iowa supreme court has freed local 
governments to impose curfews on minors to fight drug abuse and 
crime 
the court in a 54 ruling wednesday said a curfew is only a 
minor infringement on the rights of children and parents it upheld 
a curfew set in panora that barred people under 18 from being out 
from 10 pm to 5 am 
david simmons then 15 had challenged the panora curfew after he 
was caught skateboarding at 1035 pm he argued that curfews 
unconstitutionally interfere with family rights and violate his 
right to move about as he pleased 
dissenters in the ruling said the court was allowing fundamental 
rights to be trampled because of panic over crime and drugs

affirmative action programs weakened by recent 
court rulings can be saved only by lobbying and intensive 
fundraising an naacp lawyer told civil rights leaders 
the naacp legal defense fund has received seven requests for help 
in defending minority setaside programs julius chambers told the 
southern christian leadership conference at its annual meeting 
wednesday 
he said it would take about 1 million to lobby for minority 
setaside programs and more to take the cases to court 
the supreme court set out with an agenda to rewrite civil 
rights and theyve done a pretty successful job chambers said 
during its recent term the court made it easier to challenge 
affirmative action programs already in place and made it harder to 
initiate and win discrimination suits 
sclc president joseph lowery said civil rights leaders will 
continue trying to persuade the bush administration to seek 
legislation to preserve affirmative action 
attorney general richard thornburgh said earlier this year that 
the administration did not intend to pursue the matter 
ohio gov richard celeste a democrat said the bush 
administration has lagged on education and training programs and 
affirmative action 
if the government can find enough money to bail out the savings 
and loan industry why cant we find a few billion dollars for 
head start programs and setaside programs that award public 
contracts to minorities he asked 
sclc members agreed to use the vote to pressure lawmakers for 
action and said they would work to raise money to help the naacp 
legal defense fund handle requests for help 
the sclc convention runs through friday

the suspect in the nations worst unsolved 
serial murder case is really the scapegoat of a reckless 
investigation his brother says 
robert j stevens said wednesday he has proof that his brother 
william jay stevens ii was on a family vacation on the east coast 
when the first victims of the green river serial killer disappeared 
william stevens 38 has been identified as a suspect by the 
green river task force but has not been charged in any of the 48 
deaths or disappearances of women between 1982 and 1985 near seattle 
and portland ore the first five victims were found along the green 
river south of seattle 
stevens is completing a jail sentence in seattle for a 1979 
burglary and his 1981 escape from a work release center 
i believe in my brothers innocence robert stevens said at a 
news conference he said the task force is no longer looking at his 
brother for the first five killings 
stevens gave reporters a list of credit card charges made in the 
northeastern united states in june and july 1982 he also showed 
four photographs he said are from a monthlong vacation taken by his 
brother and his parents which included a visit to robert stevens 
and his family in connecticut in july 1982 
stevens said he has given the information and photographs to task 
force investigators who interviewed him at his fathers home 
tuesday 
he said he found the photographs a week ago in his fathers 
spokane home which the task force searched last month 
investigators did not seize the photographs because they only 
searched his brothers room and personal belongings he said 
the task force has been reckless in their investigation and 
have done nothing but harass my brother family and friends 
stevens said he complained that investigators waited more than 
seven months after william stevens arrest in january to contact him 
for information about his brothers whereabouts during 198185 
before the press conference task force commander bob evans said 
detectives visited the stevens home on tuesday but that the 
information on william stevens vacations was not new he said the 
investigation was continuing 
craig beles william stevens attorney in seattle said his 
client had no comment 
police last month searched two spokane residences where william 
stevens lived while attending gonzaga university law school 
investigators carted away around 50 boxes of materials including a 
collection of police badges videotapes and other paraphernalia 
robert stevens said he only recently obtained a copy of the 
affidavit used to obtain the search warrant and spent two weeks 
compiling the information that he said clears his brother 
he also said he is searching for more information that will prove 
his brother was not in the areas where other green river victims 
disappeared 
stevens 37 a senior chief petty officer at the navy submarine 
base at bangor wash is on humanitarian leave to care for his 
father who is recovering from surgery on a brain tumor earlier this 
summer stevens mother died in june 
looking back i believe he is more a scapegoat than he is a 
suspect he said of his brother the task force may have focused 
on him to justify the money it spent and to try and continue its 
operation he said 
the stevens family hopes to have this all cleared up by the 
time my brother is released from seattle robert stevens said he 
also said the family make take legal action against the police and 
the press but did not elaborate 
william stevens is scheduled to get out of jail sept 26

mike sevel wasnt overly concerned that 
night 20 years ago as he helped his father maneuver their 65foot 
shrimp boat up the biloxi river to shelter from an approaching storm 
but for the sevels and hundreds of other fishermen along the 
mississippi gulf coast on aug 17 1969 the destructive power of 
hurricane camille would soon become painfully clear 
camilles 200 mph winds pushed a wall of water over mississippis 
coastline tossing oceangoing ships onto the beach ripping away 
all but the pilings in harbors and damaging or destroying thousands 
of coastal homes and businesses 
the most powerful storm in us history camille danced along the 
coast for days before roaring ashore in mississippi two hundred 
fortyeight people died including 141 in mississippi 
sevel said his father decided to move their boat to the safety of 
the river as soon as the outward winds of the hurricane reached 
gulfports commercial small craft harbor 
after we moved up the river we tied our boat up to a paperwood 
barge said sevel 16 at the time nearby there was a cluster of 
pilings and three or four boats tied up between them 
sevel said the water rose higher throughout the night and the 
winds whipped up to a howl 
and while you couldnt see them you knew there were tornadoes 
moving around us because you could hear the sudden roar he said 
we had tied to the pilings with several lines and after camille 
came through there was only one line left the rest had snapped 
we fought all night long and there were times i wasnt sure we 
could make it 
he said some of the other boats in the pack either sank under the 
weight of the rushing water or were pounded into the river banks 
frank wells 65 said he left gulfport ahead of the storm and 
took his 35foot shrimp boat up a bayou near his empire la home 
we took shelter behind a ferry on the bayou and we made it fine 
but while we were saving the boat we lost our home he said we 
had 18 feet of water come through empire 
camille destroyed 6744 homes and damaged 46709 more while 
destroying or damaging 746 businesses 
shrimper luther rowell 53 said his most vivid memory of camille 
was returning to the harbor at gulfport after weeks of waiting 
aboard his boat on the river while crews worked to restore power to 
drawbridges 
i remember that when he got back there was no wharf only 
pilings rowell said we had to take scraps of wood to make a 
walk there was destruction everywhere you turned 
commercial fisherman james l ladner of gulfport spent that night 
at his brothers supermarket a few blocks inland but returned the 
next morning to the beach area 
i can still remember seeing those three ships that got caught 
up on the beach two of them had to be scrapped he said all 
along the beach there was total destruction and there was nothing 
left of us 90 then the major traffic route along the 
mississippi coast 
and i remember there were plenty of shrimp out there he said 
pointing to the mississippi sound but so much stuff had washed 
into the water that when you pulled in your nets they were filled 
with things like refrigerators bathtubs and even car batteries

troops loyal to chinas president detained the 
nations defense minister and several military commanders after a 
dispute over who would fill a top military post chinese sources 
said today 
the sources said president yang shangkun a mastermind of the 
martial law crackdown in beijing apparently ordered the move to 
strengthen his control of the chinese military the post had been 
held by communist party boss zhao ziyang who was purged for 
allegedly supporting the prodemocracy movement 
control of the military is an essential ingredient in chinese 
politics senior leader deng xiaopings only official post is 
chairman of the central military commission chinas top military 
body 
troops went to the beijing residence of defense minister qin 
jiwei wednesday evening and took him and one of his guards away the 
chinese sources said troops later took away the heads of the 
beijing guangzhou and nanjing military districts who supported qin 
and were in beijing for an important meeting the sources said 
one source said the troops were from the garrison headquarters of 
beijing a special force that protects top military and political 
leaders and is directed by yang the sources said they believed that 
qin and the others went unwillingly and the sources said they did 
not know where the officials were it was not immediately possible 
to confirm the report 
however the sources contacted the associated press separately 
one source is a military officer who called the ap early this 
morning from beijing the other is a hong kongbased businessman 
who said he has extensive contacts within the chinese military 
in other developments a chinese government spokesman confirmed 
in an interview published today that wang dan a leader of the 
spring prodemocracy movement and one of the countrys most wanted 
fugitives has been arrested 
state council spokesman yuan mu said wang was arrested july 2 
after meeting with a taiwanese reporter who was detained and later 
expelled from china 
yuan was interviewed by the japanese newspaper yomiuri shimbun 
and his comments were reported by chinas official xinhua news 
agency 
wang a 20yearold history student at beijing university went 
underground after authorities issued an arrest warrant for him and 
20 other students involved in the democracy protests eight fugitive 
students have been arrested and two are known to have fled the 
country 
also today a shanghai newspaper said authorities arrested or 
were investigating 99 people accused of involvement in illegal 
workers groups that plotted to establish a peoples party and 
kidnap officials the groups planned to overthrow the government 
the shanghai liberation daily said 
regarding the reported military dispute qin and yang are both 
jockeying to fill the post of first vice chairman of the central 
military commission which was occupied by zhao before he was purged 
in june 
zhao was purged following the student demonstrations for sweeping 
political change in china those demonstrations ended on june 3 when 
thousands of soldiers attacked protesters and crushed the movement 
earlier chinese sources had said qin had opposed martial law in 
beijing and the use of force to clear tiananmen square he was 
overruled 
moves by yang to take over zhaos old post appear to indicate 
that he hopes to solidify his control of the military upon dengs 
death deng 84 is reported to be in poor health 
yang who is also 84 is reported to be healthy

a federal official dismisses fears that sludge 
from the polluted boston harbor will be sold as fertilizer in texas 
but sen lloyd bentsen is taking the idea seriously 
bentsen dtexas says hes made it clear to the environmental 
protection agency that texas should not become the repository of 
sludge that is too contaminated to remain in the commonwealth of 
massachusetts 
bentsen and texas agricultural commissioner jim hightower point 
to a draft proposal to market boston sludge as fertilizer as well 
as an internal epa memo that said the sludge is too filthy to be 
used as fertilizer under massachusetts law it is too filthy for all 
of new england and new york 
well then i believe its too filthy for massey new deal and 
new ulm texas too hightower told bentsen in seeking the 
senators support in his fight against hauling bostons pollution 
problem halfway across the country so it can then become a texas 
problem 
according to hightower the sludge contains a relatively high 
percentage of industrial toxic waste that is not pretreated 
leaving it replete with such potentially dangerous contaminants as 
mercury molybdenum copper and cadmium 
boston harbor pollution was an issue in the 1988 presidential 
campaign with george bush accusing massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis of acting too slowly to deal with the problem bentsen was 
dukakis vice presidential running mate 
the massachusetts water resources authority has no intention 
no contracts no plans to use these pellets in texas principally 
because of the high cost of transportation paul keough acting 
administrator of the epa region that includes massachusetts said 
wednesday 
there doesnt seem to be any interest in sending the material 
to texas so there seems to be much ado about nothing keough said 
paul dinatale chief spokesman for the massachusetts water 
authority which is coordinating the boston harbor cleanup took 
strong issue with the memo written by epa headquarters staffers 
that memo accused the epa and the water authority of ignoring 
proposed water regulations and proceeding to shop around for 
states with weak environmental laws where they can market their 
contaminated sludge as fertilizer they have focused in on the 
southeast and on texas and florida in particular 
although bentsen said he understands drafts of reports sometimes 
never advance beyond the preliminary stages this is one proposal 
that should never reach the status of a mature idea

tamil guerrillas today entered a 
hospital in a northern town and fired rockets and guns at an indian 
army post on the street below killing at least 24 soldiers 
officials said 
the guerrillas entered the main hospital at mannar 160 miles 
north of colombo late wednesday night and launched the attack 
shortly after midnight officials in colombo and new delhi said 
they opened fire in utter disregard of the 89 patients inside 
the hospital said a foreign ministry official in new delhi 
because the indian peacekeeping troops were conscious that 
retaliatory fire would cause casualties in the hospital they did 
not use heavy weapons 
the official who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
blamed the attack on the liberation tigers of tamil eelam a rebel 
group that has been fighting indian soldiers deployed in sri lanka 
to contain the tamil insurgency 
he said he knew of no casualties among the rebels or civilians 
but added that sporadic fighting around the hospital was continuing 
in other sectarian violence the government said 20 killings 
occurred wednesday night and today the victims included at least 
eight young sinhalese men whose bodies were found near the capital 
before the attack on the indian army post the liberation tigers 
accused indian troops of killing 6000 tamil civilians during the 
past 22 months the accusation was included in an appeal addressed 
to the united nations and demanded the troops be withdrawn as early 
as possible a copy of the appeal was released to reporters 
wednesday night 
a spokesman at the indian high commission or embassy said he 
had not seen the statement and could not comment on it an indian 
foreign ministry spokesman in new delhi also declined comment 
the tigers statement also accused indian troops of widespread 
atrocities torture and extrajudicial killings and claimed that 
more than 3000 tamil civilians are being held by the soldiers 
during the first months of the indian offensive to secure the 
control of jaffna city over 2000 civilians were killed and 
several thousand were wounded the statement said 
the indian offensive began in october 1987 the tigers claim of 
6000 deaths since then is nearly double the total compiled from sri 
lankan and indian estimates that about 2500 tamil civilians and 
about 1100 tamil guerrillas have been killed in the past 22 months 
of fighting in addition about 1000 indian soldiers have died in 
the peacekeeping operation 
india sent troops to sri lanka on july 30 1987 to enforce an 
indiansri lankan peace accord aimed at ending a tamil insurgency 
for an independent nation the accord offered limited autonomy to 
tamils in exchange for an arms surrender by tamil militias 
the tamil tigers reneged on the accord and soon started attacking 
the indian soldiers other separatist groups abided by the accord 
and joined the political mainstream

a jury awarded 523000 to a tv station 
employee who was fired after finding and showing to coworkers a 
tornup memo her boss had written criticizing her 
the hennepin county jurys award wednesday to wendy bradley a 
38yearold onetime employee of the kstp promotions department 
included 11000 for breach of promise and 500000 in punitive 
damages 
kstp attorney charles mays argued that bradley was fired in 1986 
for breaching a promise of confidentiality she had showed other 
employees a memo written by her boss virginia hubbard 
the memo to another manager said that bradley was not an asset to 
the department that she had been involved in two legal disputes 
that a case was being built against her and that she could be 
replaced by a secretary 
bradley claimed that she found the memo in pieces on a table by a 
copying machine ms hubbard said she believed that bradley had 
taken the pieces from a wastebasket in ms hubbards office 
bradleys attorney donald horton told the jury she had had no 
problems on the job until she cooperated with a state investigation 
of sexual harassment allegations 
still pending in the case are claims by bradley that she was 
discriminated against on the basis of sex and marital status and had 
been retaliated against for taking part in the harassment 
investigation and another on job posting

crash investigators left ethiopia 
today after inspecting the wreckage of the twinengine plane that 
carried us rep mickey leland and 15 other people to their deaths 
the american and canadian specialists spent wednesday nd part of 
today on the steep slopes of tam mountain in southwestern ethiopia 
looking through the remains of the twin otter that slammed nose 
first into a cliff while en route to a refugee camp aug 7 
they announced no findings but sources close to the 
investigation said bad weather and faulty judgment by the pilot were 
at least contributing factors in the crash 
the sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity said the 
pilot had been warned by weather forecasters of heavy clouds rain 
and poor visibility all along his planned 300mile route 
the planes takeoff from addis ababas bole airport was delayed 
for two hours by bad weather and flying conditions were still only 
marginal when it finally left the ground 
sources said the weather was even worse in the southwest 
although radar scans showed a break in the clouds over lelands 
destination the fugnido refugee camp 
the investigating team was made up of members of the us 
national transportation safety board its canadian counterpart and 
representatives of the boeing and pratt and whitney companies 
boeing provided the airframe and pratt and whitney built the 
engines of the craft which was manufactured in a canadian plant 
the investigation is being conducted jointly with the ethiopian 
civil aviation authority 
eight other americans and seven ethiopians including the pilot 
accompanied the texas democrat on the flight us military forensic 
experts were trying to identify their remains which were recovered 
from the mountain tuesday

the pilot of the small plane that crashed 
and killed rep larkin smith appeared nervous before the flight ran 
the aircraft off the runway before takeoff and flew in the wrong 
direction an investigator says 
a second investigator with the national transportation safety 
board said weather may have been a factor in the crash sunday night 
the singleengine plane carrying smith 45 and pilot chuck 
vierling 58 traveled east of its planned flight path slamming 
into a 70foot pine tree in a forest the mississippi republican was 
returning from hattiesburg to gulfport 70 miles south both men 
died in the crash 
witnesses reported that before takeoff vierling appeared kind 
of nervous like he was concerned about the flight jorge 
prellezo regional director for the national transportation safety 
board said in an interview wednesday in miami 
william dowden an employee of southeast aviation said he 
observed vierlings plane during and after takeoff from the 
hattiesburg airport 
he taxied straight out off the ramp area onto the grass and 
when he realized what had happened he made a 180degree turn then 
taxied slowly out to the runway said dowden the taxiways are 
lit up with blue lights and what happened struck us as being highly 
unusual 
prellezo said there were other questions about the flight 
including why the pilot had indicated to controllers he would follow 
the established route along a highway but instead flew about nine 
miles east over the forest 
after taking off he headed east and when he contacted air 
traffic control at houston they told him well if you want to go 
to gulfport you had better take a southerly heading prellezo 
said 
vierling was a licensed pilot and a friend of smiths he had 
been flying since 1963 said his stepson glenn terrell the plane 
belonged to gulfports institute for marine mammal studies 
authorities said 
jeff kennedy another ntsb investigator said at a news 
conference in biloxi on wednesday that although weather reports 
cited visibility of nearly six miles darkness and haze may have 
affected the pilots vision 
vierling would have had few ground lights to guide him over the 
rural area kennedy said he noted that search helicopters were 
grounded by fog about 430 am 
its hard to determine what kind of flying conditions he was 
in kennedy said 
charles theologos a parttime federal aviation administration 
instructor said vierling was not certified to fly by instruments 
alone but authorities said the weather was good enough for him to 
take off sunday night 
investigators were also examining the possibility the plane ran 
out of fuel following reports there was no smell of gasoline at the 
crash site said prellezo

more than 120 vietnamese who fled their homeland 
by boat headed back by plane today in the biggest voluntary return 
of refugees from this british colony 
waving handkerchiefs and clutching bags packed with clothes and 
radios the refugees boarded a boeing 737 at hong kongs airport and 
took off for hanoi 
from there the 46 men 40 women 17 boys and 18 girls will be 
taken to their hometowns and monitored by the united nations high 
commissioner for refugees 
i think this is an extremely hopeful sign said robert van 
leeuwen head of the un refugee office in hong kong as the jet 
took off 
originally 124 people had volunteered to return but three were 
forced to stay in hong kong for medical reasons van leeuwen said 
he said 190 more people were awaiting a chance to return to 
vietnam and that 600 to 700 more refugees had already applied to go 
back 
voluntary repatriation is the best shot van leeuwen said 
the remark was significant because vietnam and britain are 
negotiating a plan to force many of the 51000 vietnamese refugess 
living in hong kong back to vietnam 
the communist government in hanoi said it will not prosecute 
those returning to the country one of the poorest in asia un 
officials today reiterated that they will closely monitor the fate 
of the returning refugees 
until last year hong kong allowed all vietnamese refugees to 
settle in hong kong if they could not go to another country 
but to stem the flood to the crowded colony of 5 million the 
government in june ruled out resettlement for new refugees unless 
they could prove they were escaping political persecution 
since then about 38300 vietnanmese have sailed to hong kong and 
are being housed in a series of camps detention centers and halfway 
houses about 4700 live in tents on a nearby island and another 
1800 cram five ferries 
van leeuwen said adult returnees had been given 150 each and 
children 14 years or under were given 75 each when they returned 
several boat people interviewed this week said they were going 
home because they missed their families 
i miss my old mother very much said le thi minh from 
haiphong she said her brother was unable to care for their mother 
because he is in jail for attempting to flee vietnve to take risks she 
said about returning home 
but the pull of my family is too strong 
van leeuwen said un officials will help resettle the returning 
refugees providing assistance on a casebycase basis

a federal appeals court today overturned a 
jurys 94 million award to relatives of a woman murdered by a 
mercenary hired through an ad in soldier of fortune magazine 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals said that holding the 
magazine responsible for the slaying of sandra black in 1985 would 
impose too great a burden on publishers to screen ambiguously worded 
advertisements 
although the magazine said the judgment against it had violated 
its first amendment right to freedom of the press the court did not 
address first amendment arguments basing its ruling instead on 
texas liability law 
soldier of fortune owed no duty to refrain from publishing a 
facially innocuous classified advertisement when the ads context 
at most made its message ambiguous judge w eugene davis wrote 
for the unanimous threejudge panel 
mrs black was slain in bryan texas a federal jury in houston 
in 1988 awarded her son and mother 94 million over an ad john 
wayne hearn placed in a 1984 issue of the magazine which is aimed 
at adventurers and military enthusiasts 
mrs blacks husband robert was convicted of hiring hearn to 
kill her robert black is on death row in texas and hearn is in 
florida serving three life sentences for the black killing and two 
other murders 
soldier of fortunes lawyers argued that there was no way its 
publishers could have known that hearns ad offering an exmarine 
and vietnam veterans services for highrisk assignments was a 
solicitation for murder 
the burden on a publisher to avoid liability from suits of this 
type is too great the appeals court ruled today 
the court said without a more specific indication of illegal 
intent than hearns ad or its context provided we conclude that 
soldier of fortune did not violate the standard of conduct by 
publishing an ad that later played a role in criminal activity 
john roberson a lawyer for mrs blacks son gary 19 and 
mother marjorie eimann 65 said highrisk assignment clearly 
meant gun for hire in the lingo of the magazine 
attorneys for the magazine conceded that possibility but said the 
ad could be seen simply as a solicitation for a job as a bodyguard 
or security officer

the communist party today suggested a rewrite of 
the agreement that formed the soviet union opening the possibility 
for complete change in the nations structure 
party leaders also said the 15 soviet republics might be able to 
question national laws before a high court with greater powers 
according to a draft policy published in the communist party daily 
pravda 
it appeared to be a partial concession to the baltic republics of 
estonia latvia and lithuania which have amended their 
constitutions to have the right to reject national laws the kremlin 
has said this violates the soviet constitution 
the draft policy also calls for a law banning nationalist and 
chauvinist organizations which could be used against groups 
demanding independence from the central government 
the partys central committee is to act on the measures at a 
meeting in september 
the party said that to achieve a transformation of the soviet 
federation the question has been raised of working out and 
signing a new union agreement instead of the treaty on the formation 
of the ussr of 1922 
that could be limited to expanding the powers of the 15 
republics but it also opens the possibility that radicals could 
push through a complete change 
human rights activist andrei sakharov has suggested a loose 
confederation of sovereign states and many nationalists in the 
baltics and georgia have called for secession from the soviet union 
aigar irgens an editor at atmoda the newspaper of the latvian 
popular front said of the partys proposal we dont want a new 
agreement we want complete independence 
many of the more than 100 nationalities in the soviet union have 
formed groups to agitate for changes ranging from restoration of 
their native languages to secession 
the proposed law against nationalist and chauvenist 
organizations could target prosecession groups such as the party 
of national independence in georgia russian strikers protesting a 
new language law in estonia or the massmembership estonian popular 
front which supported the language law 
irgens said the effect of the proposed ban would depend on the 
definition of nationalist we have nationalist groups in latvia 
but the term is very broad he said 
the communist party proposal says the republics can raise the 
question of rejecting national laws they believe exceed the 
authority of the central government but it says the central 
government has the power to cancel unconstitutional laws passed in 
the republics 
the party suggests that such disputes be settled by the 
constitutional control commission a new quasisupreme court created 
in last years political reform 
publication of the draft proposal was highly unusual in that it 
came prior to its adoption until recently the party did not 
announce the dates and agendas of its central committee meetings 
until they were under way 
the draft which was approved by the ruling politburo is 
expected to be discussed by party officials in the republics prior 
to next months meeting 
that meeting has been postponed several times because of ethnic 
violence that has killed more than 200 people in the last year and a 
half 
in hopes of heading off futher conflict the party proposal calls 
for a law that would guarantee the rights of citizens living outside 
their national boundaries 
it also calls for creation of a government entity to handle 
ethnic relations 
in helsinki finland today gen dmitri yazov the soviet defense 
minister said the soviet union would not increase its military 
presence in the baltic republics despite strikes and demonstrations 
in the region 
the situation in the baltic republics is due to our domestic 
policies of glasnost and perestroika and as you well understand 
the results have not always been positive yazov told reporters 
during a threeday visit to finland that ends friday 
glasnost and perestroika are not meant for everyone and the 
new legislation in estonia is a step backward yazov said 
referring to new estonian legislation requiring a minimum two years 
residence in the republic to vote in local elections glasnost 
and perestroika are the catchwords of president mikhail 
gorbachevs economic and social reforms 
the new estonian legislation prompted the strikes by ethnic 
russians alleging discrimination on wednesday the national 
presidium declared the new estonian election law unconstitutional

seventytwoyearold gertrude eberly 
had been retired for nine years living in nevada on a modest 
pension when the state of california dunned her for nearly 4000 
even though eberly had moved from california in 1978 the 
franchise tax board sent the former state worker a bill in december 
1987 for back taxes interest and penalties on her california 
pension for 198186 
after exhausting appeals to the tax board and state and federal 
politicians eberly arranged to pay california allowed her to make 
50 monthly installments to accommodate her annual pension and 
social security income of less than 13000 
but in pursuing the money california unwittingly fueled a 
growing grassroots campaign against what eberly and other pensioners 
nationwide say is unfair taxation by 13 states 
i was just totally overcome and so helpless eberly said in a 
telephone interview from her home in fallon nev where she moved 
to be near her daughters family after retiring with 31 years 
service in the california employment development department 
i wrote i think it was 120 letters to senators and 
representatives and advocacy agencies for the elderly i got seven 
replies in those they said well this is not our problem 
her nevada representatives told her that since it was a 
california tax she should write to gov george deukmejian 
deukmejians office politely suggested she write her nevada 
representatives 
i had no representation thats when i got angry and decided it 
was unconstitutional 
california is one of 13 states that collect a source tax on 
pensions sent outside their borders said bill hoffman head of a 
group called retirees to eliminate state income source tax or 
resist 
the other states are arkansas idaho iowa kansas maryland 
massachusetts new jersey new york oregon utah vermont and 
virginia hoffman said north carolina recently approved a similar 
tax and several other states are poised to do so he said 
resist members complain they are paying taxes to states where 
they are no longer residents cant vote and dont use the freeways 
and other taxfinanced services 
of course the biggest objection to this tax is that its 
taxation without representation hoffman said i have no control 
over it they could double or triple or quadruple the tax and i 
couldnt do anything about it 
hoffman 57 a retired aerospace engineer founded resist last 
summer after he and his wife joanne moved from torrance to carson 
city nev only to find they still had to pay california taxes 
nevada has no state income tax 
the looseknit organization now has chapters in at least 35 
states with about 8000 members who are lobbying for federal 
legislation to outlaw the tax 
their tax revolt is a lawabiding one like eberly most end up 
paying the tax albeit under protest hoffman and tax officials said 
according to tax officials source tax on nonresidents is legal 
and fair 
pensioners werent taxed on the income when it went into their 
retirement accounts but are obligated to pay the tax once they 
collect retirement whether they still live in the state or not 
we are not taxing people without representation said jim 
reber a spokesman for the franchise tax board they were 
represented when they made that income 
california source tax dates to 1935 but the state has stepped up 
enforcement in recent years largely because of new more 
sophisticated computer records to track potential taxpayers reber 
said 
in 1986 the state collected 7 million from 33000 nonresidents 
who filed returns reporting pensions and annuities from california 
he said that compares with 409 million in income taxes on 
annuities and pensions reported by 16 million californians during 
the same year 
the concept is this all during the time you were working in 
california you were receiving a professional tax break on deferred 
income reber said 
it was money that was never taxed in the first place now 
that youre retired the state wants its fair share of that tax 
california has agreements with other states that levy income tax 
to prevent double taxation on the pensions 
california only taxes income earned within the state but it 
calculates the tax rate based on total income which can 
substantially raise the tax bill if the retiree has other income 
the new home state may do the same critics say the result is in 
effect double taxation 
retirees with california pensions say their former home state 
never told them about the tax before sending them bills that include 
late penalties of 55 percent and interest of 10 percent to 13 
percent 
if indeed they were going to do this to us somebody should 
have told us hoffman said and i think they should have given 
us some options maybe we could have paid the taxes as we went 
along

clam beds on georges bank have been closed because 
of high levels of toxins caused by red tide 
the 90day closing of the fishing grounds 100 miles east of cape 
cod to surfclam harvesters was declared last week by the us 
department of commerce 
high quantities of paralytic shellfish toxins were found in the 
clams said brian gorman of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration red tide toxin causes tingling on the tongue and 
lips and can lead to respiratory failure and death 
gorman said he believed it was the first time in the roughly five 
years that surf clams have been extensively fished on the bank that 
the area was closed because of red tide an algaelike organism 
normally found in shellfish closer to shore 
surf clams are used mainly in canned soup and other processed 
food because they are tougher than regular clams found in coastal 
waters gorman said 
the value of the surf clam catch in that area last year was 
800000 said jack terrill a resource policy analyst for the 
national marine fisheries service in gloucester 
terrill said finding the toxins in shellfish so far from shore 
caught everybody by surprise

said it was possible that police might arrest the five white black 
and indian activists who announced the campaign while dressed in 
united democratic front tshirts such items are banned under the 
governments emergency regulations 
we dont plan our actions having that detention in mind 
otherwise we wouldnt plan anything mafolo said

youth and labor groups that was banned in feburary 1988 will lead 
all restricted organizations at a mass rally at the university 
of the witwatersrand in johannesburg on sunday mafolo said

released from detention began violating their restrictions which 
confined them to their homes at night curtailed their political

violence however there have been almost daily confrontations in 
the cape town area between mixedrace students and police in which 
the youths have thrown stones and erected barricades in the streets 
and the police have fired tear gas the school violence spread to 
durban this week where it was met with police birdshot

a group of 121 vietnamese returned thursday to 
the land they fled the largest voluntary repatriation of refugees 
from hong kongs teeming camps 
waving handkerchiefs and clutching bags packed with clothes and 
radios the refugees boarded a boeing 737 at hong kongs airport and 
took off for hanoi 
from there the 46 men 40 women 17 boys and 18 girls will be 
taken to their hometowns and monitored by the united nations high 
commissioner for refugees 
i think this is an extremely hopeful sign said robert van 
leeuwen head of the un refugee office in hong kong as the jets 
engines roared behind him the vietnamese seemed very hopeful to 
go back 
originally 124 people had volunteered to return but three were 
forced to stay in hong kong for medical reasons van leeuwen said 
he said 190 more were waiting to return to vietnam and between 
600 and 700 more refugees had applied to go back 
voluntary repatriation is the best shot he said the remark 
was significant because vietnam and britain are negotiating a plan 
to force many of the 51000 vietnamese refugees to return the 
united states has said it opposes forced repatriation 
hanois communist government has said it wont prosecute those 
returning to the country one of the poorest in asia un officials 
on thursday reiterated that they would monitor the returning 
refugees closely 
until last year hong kong allowed all vietnamese refugees the 
right to settle in the british colony if they could not immigrate to 
another country but under a tough policy instituted in june the 
government ruled out resettlement for new refugees unless they could 
prove they were escaping political persecution 
since then about 38300 vietnanmese have sailed to hong kong and 
are being housed in a series of camps detention centers and halfway 
houses in the crowded colony of 5 million people about 4700 live 
in tents on a nearby island and another 1800 cram five ferries in 
conditions the united nations has called lifethreatening 
the government began a voluntary repatriation program in march 
and groups of 75 and 68 refugees have returned 
van leeuwen said although the voluntary repatriation program had 
begun slowly he had hopes that it would soon accelerate 
he said adult returnees had been given 150 and children 14 years 
or under 75 to return previous groups had been given 50 for 
adults and 25 for children 
the departure comes at a time when hong kong is under pressure 
from the united nations to improve the conditions in the camps 
a preliminary report earlier this week said boat people on tai a 
chau island and on five ferries in hong kongs harbor were in danger 
of dying because of malnutrition and disease 
last week another un official said the camps were some of the 
worst he had seen saying the space given to some refugees is even 
less than what is supposed to be given here for a dog 
the un also has alleged police beat about 100 boat people 
during a july 23 disturbance at a detention center in the new 
territories section of hong kong 
several of the boat people said they were going home because they 
missed their families 
in the philippines meanwhile a un refugee agency said 166 
vietnamese boat people landed in the country in august 
a report by the manila representative of the united nations high 
commissioner for refugees said the most recent arrival occurred 
monday when 21 vietnamese reached lawak island off palawan 
province 360 miles southwest of manila 
the august arrivals brought to 5438 the number of boat people 
who have landed in the philippines this year the report said 
although the month is far from over a source who asked not to be 
identified said the august arrivals so far indicate a decline from 
the 604 vietnamese refugees who landed in the philippines during the 
same month last year

president bush monitored 
governmental shuffling in poland today as he began a threeweek 
seaside vacation and the white house said the sensitive 
situation was an overall positive development 
we do encourage and support the process of pluralism and it 
appears that is the general direction that they are aimed in 
poland press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters who 
accompanied the president to maine 
certainly a noncommunist government would be a remarkable and 
historymaking occurrence he added in reference to reports tht 
opposition leader lech walesa was being supported for prime minister 
by his own solidarity labor movement and two small political parties 
that have traditaionlly backed the communists 
fitzwater spoke today before it was reported that polish 
president wojciech jaruzelski approved walesas offer to form a 
coalition government led by noncommunists but after learning of 
the development he said there still are many unanswered 
questions 
he said the president had not been immediately informed of the 
development because he was out boating 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
we welcome progress in the formation of a government which would 
enjoy broad and popular support and we emphasize this continues to 
be a matter for the polish people 
bush met with walesa as well as goverment leaders during his 
trip to europe in july 
fitzwater said bush had not been directly involved in talks with 
east bloc leaders on the subject the spokesman was careful to state 
that the united states did not want to intrude in the internal 
affairs in poland but said the united states would encourage a 
noncommunist government 
its a sensitive situation there in terms of the general move 
away from communist control but we do not want to do anything 
or say anything to upset the apple cart as it were in terms of the 
progress theyre making 
we feel very positive in an oveerall sense about events that 
are occurring there 
fitzwater said the president after his morning intelligence 
briefings went boating this morning accompanied by two of his sons 
george and neil 
several other offspring and grandchildren joined the president 
and first lady barbara bush on wednesday night to watch the lunar 
eclipse from the family compound on walkers point 
bush arrived in maine wednesday announcing he was aiming to 
get my body in shape with his favorite vacation pastime 
intensive exercise 
the president and first lady barbara bush were expecting separate 
visits from canadian prime minister brian mulroney and danish prime 
minister poul schluter but those were to be personal rather than 
businessoriented the white house said 
bush flew to this resort town from miami where he made a oneday 
campaign foray in behalf of republican congressional candidate 
ileana roslehtinen who is vying against democrat gerald richman to 
succeed the late democratic rep claude pepper 
the white house also announced wednesday that bush will make his 
first televised address to the nation as president sept 5 to reveal 
his national strategy to combat drug abuse 
the president wanted to discuss it directly with the american 
people fitzwater said 
fitzwater said the president in a meeting tuesday with his 
domestic policy council of cabinet and senior advisers signed off 
on the broad planks of the strategy he said however theres 
still some outstanding specifics to be decided 
the strategy will target drug users much more intensively than 
past policy which has focused on interdiction said one 
knowledgeable official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
bush on wednesday made a decision on one key aspect of the 
antidrug plan that had divided his top advisers whether to 
withhold federal highway funds and other support to states that fail 
to implement sufficiently tough policies such as revoking drivers 
licenses of drug offenders it was learned however officials did 
not disclose the presidents decision 
officials said the antidrug strategy also will entail expanded 
use of the us military to help combat drugs at the source in 
foreign countries when those countries request assistance 
the no 1 issue in miami and the no 1 issue across america 
is drugs and the violent crime they spawn bush said in miami 
bush also made a point on the miami stop of stating that he will 
never restore normalized relations with cuba unless president fidel 
castro implements democratic freedoms for his people 
drug policy coordinator william j bennett has called for a 
dramatic increase in drug treatment funds for 1990 according to a 
draft of his national drug strategy 
the draft obtained by the associated press revealed that bennett 
wants 925 million for drug treatment next year a 49 percent 
increase over the current spending 
another administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said wednesday the drug plans total cost would be 
roughly a billion dollars more than bushs february budget 
proposal of 55 billion for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
bush plans to interrupt his vacation for a visit in washington on 
sept 1 with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
bush will return to washington the day before he makes the 
television address on drugs in the meantime he was eager to begin 
his vacation regimen of running boating fishing tennis and golf 
while staying at his family compound on walkers point 
bush brought only a skeleton crew of staff with him and aides 
said he did not expect to conduct much business beyond his daily 
intelligence briefings

renewed fighting in northwestern 
somilia has forced about 8000 people to flee to ethiopia in the 
past two weeks according to a un official 
albertalain peters an addis ababa representative of the un 
high commissioner for refugees said wednesday that about 650 
refugees were entering ethiopia daily up from 150 at the beginning 
of august 
the refugees had reported heavy fighting between the rebel somali 
national movement and government troops around the garrison town of 
borama near the ethiopian border peters said 
borama is about 60 miles northwest of hargeisa somalias 
secondlargest town 
the refugees mostly women and children are camped in a remote 
area six miles from the border and about 250 miles northeast of 
ethiopias capital addis ababa 
peters who returned from a visit to the area wednesday said the 
un agency would start caring for the refugees as soon as ethiopian 
authorities moved them to more easily accessible areas farther 
inside the country 
they are the latest in a wave of refugees who started coming 
across the border in may 1988 when fighting intensified between the 
rebels and government troops around the northern towns of hargeisa 
burao and berbera an estimated 350000 somalis have sought refuge 
in unmanaged camps near jijiga about 60 miles southwest of the 
new arrivals 
the somali national movement has been fighting to topple the 
government of president mohamed siad barre since 1981 
exiled dissidents recently have claimed barres government has 
lost control of all but the capital and is experiencing the most 
widespread fighting across the east african nation since barre 
seized power in 1969 
the dissidents say that in addition to the northern fighting 
soldiers who belong to the ogadeni clan have turned against the 
government in the south 
a kenyan newspaper reported that more than 5500 somalis had fled 
to kenya following government raids on their southern somali border 
town last month 
it is impossible to confirm rebel claims independently the 
government has refused to let journalists into somalia since may 
1988 and mogadishu residents contacted by telephone say they know 
little about events outside the capital

the navy is looking into a possible design 
miscalculation in its largest nuclear missile the trident 2 that 
may have caused the latest test failure of the weapon 
rear adm kenneth c malley chief of the navys ballistic 
missile program said that despite computer simulations engineers 
seriously underestimated the amount of pressure on the trident as it 
thrusts upward after being launched from underwater 
malley in an interview published today in the new york times 
said designers had failed to foresee how the movement of the missile 
would cause water jets and the effect they would have on the 
missile 
although the navy said it could not make malley available for an 
interview it did confirm that his statements to the times were 
accurate 
navy spokesman lt greg smith said the service retains full 
confidence in the trident system and that no impact is 
presently foreseen on the planned deployment of the submarine uss 
tennessee with the missiles in early 1990 
in a statement the navy said the submarine will undergo a 
twomonth shakedown at the electric boat docks in groton conn 
where evaluation and correction action for the test failure will 
be conducted 
in the interview malley said the missile is much larger than 
anything weve fired before we expected some extra pressure on 
the rear end of the missile and its rocket nozzles but not as much 
as were seeing it turns out that the pressure and the aft load are 
much more severe than was anticipated 
asked if the failures were a result of a design error or a flaw 
in the manufacturing the admiral said the device was built to 
specification there is no question that it was designed the way it 
was intended to be designed 
the first trident 2 exploded off the east coast of florida four 
seconds after it was launched from a submarine on march 21 the 
second test was considered largely successful but the third missile 
to be launched selfdestructed on tuesday 
the trident 2 is expected to be deployed in the 1990s aboard a 
new generation of submarines with up to eight large nuclear 
warheads it is supposed to be the navys centerpiece in the us 
nuclear arsenal until 2032 
until the test failures the missile had been one of the defense 
departments nuclear modernization programs to be mostly 
problemfree with 16 of 19 successful land launchings 
engineers apparently failed to anticipate the amount and effect 
of turbulence on the new missile during its underwater movement at 
44 feet and 130000 pounds it is much longer and almost twice as 
heavy as its earlier version the trident 1 
because of the miscalculation the original nozzles on the 
missiles firststage rocket did not have the strength to withstand 
the increased turbulence malley said 
the nozzles were redesigned after the first failure but tests 
must be done to determine why they failed during tuesdays 
launching he said 
malley said he was confident the trident 2 would be ready as 
scheduled on march 31 once the department he heads the stategic 
systems program office fixes the missile 
because of the large number of navy officials and subcontractors 
working on the trident program it was not immediately clear when or 
by whom the miscalculations were made the navy said

new telephone installation remained backlogged 
thursday by a strike at four regional bell phone companies but 
customers were having better luck reaching operator assistance 
company and union officials said 
bill bickers spokesman for the striking communications workers 
of america local at bell atlantic said service was spotty in some 
places as management personnel were pressed into unfamiliar 
duties the companys slow on installation and repairs in some 
locations 
operatorassisted calls also were not up to normal snuff but 
its moderate bickers said in some locations its really 
slow 
recorded messages continued to tell 411 directory assistance 
callers that due to the work stoppage your call may be delayed 
but telephone company officials said the waits were becoming shorter 
as managers got to know the computer equipment 
were finding that the delays have dissipated some because of 
the fact that our temporary operators have become more proficient 
with their skills said steve ford a spokesman for one of the 
four companies ameritech 
operatorassisted calls maintenance and repairs were being 
handled at near prestrike levels in many areas officials said 
but onpremises installations continued to be hard hit because of 
the strike by nearly 200000 operators clerks technicians and 
others represented by the cwa and the international brotherhood of 
electrical workers 
the strike began aug 6 against nynex bell atlantic and pacific 
telesis and on aug 13 against ameritech the walkouts affected 
phone service in 20 states and the district of columbia 
we are deferring service that requires dispatch of a human 
being said larry plumb a spokesman for philadelphiabased bell 
atlantic but if they are using service already in place that 
kind of service is being taken care of in a typical week that is 65 
percent of the work 
customers who are doing direct dialing are receiving service as 
normal plumb said where customers need to talk to a company 
representative weve seen improvement in services since the work 
stoppage as managers have gotten more familiar with their jobs 
plumb said operator assistance has returned to prework 
stoppage levels as for directory assistance there are some 
customers who will experience delays but we have seen 
improvements 
plumb said the lengths of the delays vary widely 
the phone companies urged callers to dial direct when possible 
use their telephone directories and postpone routine calls about 
billing 
the phone networks are highly automated and the strike primarily 
was affecting laborintensive areas such as installation and 
operator assistance 
melissa morin president of striking local 1400 of the cwa in new 
hampshire said directory assistance is running about a minute to 
two minutes delay 
she added however in some cases i know some people sat 
waiting 15 minutes for an operator 
morin said her 200member local had shut down business phone 
installation in the new hampshire areas served by nynex 
as far as business offices are concerned you cant get new 
service at all morin said repairs are considerably backed up 
the last i heard it was about a fiveday wait to get a phone fixed 
in northeastern areas where heavy rains have sparked failures 
however andrea dudley a spokeswoman for nynexowned new england 
telephone co said installations were proceeding albeit slowly 
obviously we are having to set priorities and phone service 
to fire departments and police would have priority she said 
obviously we are having delays but we are working through our 
orders 
there are still delays in reaching directory assistance and 
getting assistance for operator calls and we still have 
installation and repair delays dudley said 
the key challenge is installation ameritechs ford 
acknowledged if it requires a promised visit that may take 
longer than it normally would 
in indiana for instance instead of two days it may be three 
or four days before an onpremises installation may be arranged 
ford said 
scott smith a spokesman for pacific bell in san francisco said 
our repair service is normal for the most part directory 
assistance and operator assistance are near normal installation 
was slow in some areas

the former head of us laser weapons research said 
thursday he was impressed by a soviet laser he saw melt a piece of 
metal but added that neither superpower would consider the 
equipment stateoftheart technology 
john hammond former head of the directed energy program for the 
pentagons strategic defense organization and several top us 
lawmakers saw the powerful laser in action wednesday 
hammond said in an interview the powerful megawatt carbon 
dioxide laser at a secretive branch of the kurchatov institute of 
atomic energy in troitsk near moscow once was thought to have 
potential military applications but now other types of lasers are 
more promising 
this type of laser technology as to high power does not have a 
lot of relevance to more strategictype weapons such as sdi 
hammond said referring to the us strategic defense initiative 
popularly called star wars 
nevertheless he added it was quite an impressive thing to 
accomplish 
of the visit itself he said this does in fact represent an 
openness on the part of the soviet union 
hammond was joined by a group from the house armed services 
committee led by rep les aspin dwis who wind up a visit to the 
soviet union on friday 
the former sdi official said the united states developed the type 
of laser he saw demonstrated 10 years ago and that both washington 
and moscow later concluded it would be unprofitable for laser 
weapons 
in the demonstration the laser produced a beam for three seconds 
that partially melted a block of metal and spewed out balls of 
ignited gas hammond said 
the congressmen were also shown two devices used in research on 
fusion energy 
the pentagon says the soviets are developing highenergy lasers 
for strategic air defense spacebased antisatellite missions and 
defense against ballistic missiles 
the united states has a similar program 
the lawmakers have been touring soviet military and space 
facilities since aug 7 and have seen several previously secret 
facilities 
on thursday they met with yevgeny primakov the chairman of one 
of the two houses of the soviet legislature and discussed setting 
up a sovietamerican committee on arms control tass reported they 
also discussed joint work between the us congress and supreme 
soviet in freeing soviets missing or captured in afghanistan and 
americans missing or captured in north korea vietnam and laos the 
news agency said 
later in the day rep arthur ravenel jr rsc challenged a 
soviet official about emigration policy he said the congressmen met 
wednesday night with a group of refuseniks jews refused permission 
to emigrate whom he described as very sad poor dissatisfied 
apparently harmless people who just want to leave 
georgy arbatov head of the usacanada institute a kremlin 
think tank and a member of the communist partys policymaking 
central committee replied if it depended on me i would kick 
them out immediately 
arbatov blamed bureaucrats obsessed with preserving state 
security for blocking the emigration of some soviets he 
challenged ravenels estimate that there were 700 refuseniks saying 
there were just a couple dozen

president hashemi rafsanjani took office 
today and said improving the standard of living for the poor would 
take priority over political infighting the official iranian news 
agency reported 
i will start my work as president of the islamic republic of 
iran today the 54yearold middleranking cleric was quoted as 
saying by the islamic republic news agency 
rafsanjani in remarks carried later by the news agency also 
said tehran will work for the release of western hostages if the 
united states adopts a more friendly stance toward the islamic 
republic 
the agency said he made the remarks during a meeting with foreign 
minister yaqoub khan of pakistan 
we condemn hostagetaking and have many times declared this 
but we know that some of the people who resort to these things out 
of innocence and because they have no other recourse have no other 
way to defend themselves he said 
rafsanjani has emerged as irans new strongman following the june 
3 death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini architect of the 1979 
revolution that toppled the monarchy 
elected president in a landslide vote july 28 rafsanjani is 
viewed as eager to build ties with the west to gain technology and 
financing to rebuild the countrys economy shattered after eight 
years of war with iraq 
rafsanjani succeeds ali khamenei a rafsanjani ally who was 
picked to succeed khomeini as irans spiritual leader 
khomeinis son ahmad today rejected any possible relations 
between tehran and washington he also dismissed speculation that 
iranian authorities had been indirectly in contact with us 
officials to discuss the release of 16 western hostages including 
eight americans held by proiranian groups in lebanon 
tehran radio quoted khomeini 43 as saying iranian officials 
will punch america in the face and they will kick america out of 
the middle east 
the younger khomeini holds no official position in iran he has 
aligned himself with the hardline elements of the government but 
is more a symbol now that his role as his fathers spokesman is gone 
rafsanjani made no mention of the hostages in his remarks during 
todays ceremony previous reports indicated that he was sworn into 
office on aug 3 but iranian media subsequently characterized that 
event as a religious ceremony confirming his victory 
the former speaker of the majlis or parliament said his first 
goal in office would be to get the nations factories working and 
in a veiled warning to his radical opponents said a policy of 
political autonomy was meaningless if the people are hungry 
rafsanjani acknowledged a fight was brewing over his cabinet 
appointments with some current ministers refusing to serve in his 
government 
rafsanjani did not specifically name the hardline opposition 
headed by former interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi who support 
central control over the economy and keeping islamic revolutionary 
fervor sharp by challenging the west 
we have a constitution we make a pledge to implement it but 
not just one aspect of it like guarding our borders and political 
independence we must secure economic independence too rafsanjani 
said 
irans leaders have maintained a public front of unity since the 
death of khomeini 
speeches are tempered with references to following his 
guidelines but the tug of war expected after khomeinis death is 
emerging 
i certainly do not intend to choose or reject this or that 
person on political or factional grounds rafsanjani said 
he said some current ministers had refused to join his 
administration but said he would try to make use of them in some 
capacity 
on wednesday parliament elected a radical antiwestern cleric 
to succeed rafsanjani as speaker rather than his choice former 
interior minister ali akbar nateqnouri 
mehdi karrubi a 51yearold middle ranking cleric and deputy 
speaker under rafsanjani won 145 votes from the 243 deputies 
present 
karrubi is allied to rafsanjanis political rivals led by 
mohtashemi and outgoing prime minister hussein musavi whose post 
was scrapped in a constitutional reshuffle 
karrubis brother hassan was involved with rafsanjani in secret 
armsforhostages negotiations in 1985 with thenus national 
security adviser robert mcfarlane

husband after he beat her detailed years of abuse during testimony 
thursday then broke down as she recalled stabbing him and seeing 
him covered with blood 
i saw the blood coming from his ear from his nose and his 
mouth then i hugged him and kissed him thats how i got blood all 
over me donna ordway said sobbing loudly 
superior court judge robert d krause called an early lunch 
recesss so mrs ordway could regain her composure 
david ordway was stabbed feb 7 1987 in the couples glocester 
home mrs ordway claimed selfdefense she could face life in 
prison if convicted 
her firstdegree murder trial is believed to be the first time 
the batteredspouse defense has been used in rhode island 
prosecutors contend her statements after the stabbing showed that 
mrs ordway planned the killing 
mrs ordway 28 said the beatings began 1 years before her june 
1985 marriage to ordway a neighbor who had moved in with her 
hed backhand me punch me kick me rip my clothes off 
in my head my ribs anywhere she testified sometimes crying and 
dabbing her eyes with tissues 
mrs ordway recalled having her head smashed through a wall and 
seeking medical treatment several times at least once for a cracked 
rib the beatings occurred as often as three times a week after they 
were married and would start after they had been drinking or if her 
husband had financial or work problems 
mrs ordway said her husband would beat her after telling her 
im not a woman that im not any good in bed things like that 
on the night of the killing friends came to the house from 
another party but ordway became enraged and stomped out after his 
wife asked one guest if she could have his puppy mrs ordway said 
he returned found her talking on the telephone with her mother 
and began beating her and dragged her by the hair into the living 
room where he forced her to lie down she said 
mrs ordway said she got up but her husband had an enraged 
blank look in his eyes 
he had his hands out coming for me and i noticed the knife on 
the tv and i said stay away from me you sob he said 
nothing and just came after me and i stabbed him 
mrs ordway said her husband fell but she thought he would attack 
again until she saw the blood then she ran into the kitchen threw 
the knife in the sink and called an emergency squad she said 
krause denied a defense motion to dismiss the charges saying 
there was ample evidence that mrs ordway may have had malice 
witnesses have testified mrs ordway told them she knew her 
husband would be killed krause noted police testimony that mrs 
ordway told them they should have let her husband bleed to death 
rather than calling medics 
mrs ordway testified that she stayed with her husband despite 
the beatings because i loved him and i didnt have any money and 
i had kids and i had no family and nowhere to go

fbi agents say they raided two electronics 
companies and confiscated up to 18000 illegal devices for 
unscrambling pay tv signals 
wednesdays seizure was the largest such haul in a series of 
raids across the country aimed at cable tv piracy an industry 
official said 
b amp b inc in eagan and lake sylvan sales in burnsville which 
were selling the devices are being investigated for possible 
copyright and wire fraud violations the fbi said no arrests were 
made wednesday 
the devices unscramble cable and satellite tv signals allowing 
viewers to receive broadcasts without paying for them 
dennis sackreiter minneapolis fbi agent in charge of 
whitecollar crime investigations said cable companies supply 
converters that unscramble channels such as hbo and espn to tv 
viewers who pay for those channels the unscrambling is done by 
patented and copyrighted computer chips 
he said cable companies sell outdated converters to companies 
such as lake sylvan and b amp b which then update them illegally 
some 10000 to 15000 descramblers were taken from lake sylvan 
sales and 2000 to 3000 were confiscated from b amp b sackreiter 
said 
both companies denied any wrongdoing 
we always have our customers sign a disclaimer waiver that says 
they will not use this in any illegal manner lake sylvan owner 
bill donaldson said today if it is used at all they agree to 
notify the cable companies and pay the fees 
its not illegal to sell or buy the decoders said b amp b 
manager bill shultheis its what people do with them afterwards 
that may be illegal like a gun we advertise in about 20 
magazines we have nothing to hide 
cable tv operators have worked with the fbi for several years to 
crack down on unauthorized suppliers of such equipment and similar 
raids have been conducted across the nation 
of those wednesdays haul was the largest said jim allen

an airport system designed to detect dangerous wind 
shears helped three jetliners avoid a potentially catastrophic shear 
last month officials said 
you can definitely say the system worked john mccarthy 
director of windshear research for the national center for 
atmospheric research in boulder said wednesday 
a wind shear is a sudden change of wind direction that creates a 
powerful downburst of air the gust can be strong enough to drive a 
jetliner into the ground when it is landing or taking off 
powerful wind shears called microbursts have caused at least five 
accidents that claimed more than 500 lives in the last 15 years 
including the l985 crash of a delta air lines l1011 that killed 137 
people near dallas 
a microburst recorded at 95 knots or 109 mph was detected on 
july 8 by stapleton international airports lowlevel wind shear 
alert system officials said that was about 25 knots faster than 
the microburst that downed the delta jet 
three planes were approaching stapleton when airtraffic 
controllers alerted them to the probability of the wind shear 
federal aviation admnistration spokesman mitch barker said the 
pilots whose names and carriers were not identified took evasive 
action 
the absence of the alert to the pilots could have been very 
potentially catastrophic mccarthy said 
the crew of one of the aircraft said the microburst was so strong 
that it slowed the jet by approximately 58 mph and caused it to drop 
400 feet to within 600 feet of the ground mccarthy said 
the wind shear which lasted 10 minutes was detected by a system 
using 16 wind gauges spread over the airfield winds speed and 
direction readings from the devices were automatically relayed to a 
computer for analysis 
officials have been testing doppler systems at stapleton for 
their ability to detect wind shear last november the faa awarded a 
180 million contract to raytheon co to install such systems at 47 
major airports across the country beginning in the early 1990s 
the stapleton microburst is the strongest ever measured by a 
machine mccarthy said but he added we think microbursts can be 
a lot stronger than this 95 knotter 
scientists estimate microbursts can be as powerful as 200 knots

newark housing authorities today agreed to 
scale back drastically the amount of public housing to be demolished 
under a slum clearance plan and committed themselves to replacing 
the razed apartments 
the agreement beween the newark housing authority and housing 
activists was announced by us district judge dickinson r 
debevoise 
the agreement provides for the demolition of eight apartment 
buildings containing about 1900 units to make up for those lost 
apartments 1500 new apartments will be built and hundreds of 
others will be renovated 
in addition tenants in buildings being demolished will be given 
a place immediately in a new building or a renovated apartment 
previously the housing authority planned to raze 39 buildings 
with about 5700 units in the biggest demolition of public housing 
by an american city the program is aimed at getting rid of what 
critics call highrise slums 
but opponents of the plan wanted assurances that the demolished 
apartments would be replaced 
debevoise said that without the settlement the city would have 
lost about 100 million in federal funds previously approved for 
replacement housing 
in this case there is no loser the judge said 
many cities have destroyed or plan to demolish some of their 
aging highrise public projects saying they are unmanageable and 
dangerous and should be replaced by townhouses and lowrise 
buildings 
harris david an attorney for tenants in a lawsuit against the 
newark plan said my clients are extremely pleased they consider 
it a substantial victory for poor people and the cause of lowincome 
housing in the city 
the newark authority the nations eighthlargest controls 
13000 apartments and has a waiting list of 10000 families nearly 
40 percent of the apartments are vacant many awaiting demolition 
more than 800 units have already been razed 
onethird of the citys more than 300000 residents receive 
public assistance 
daniel blue jr executive director of the housing authority 
said the first demolition probably wont begin until 1990

61 had been asked to retire 
he appeared to be the latest victim of a purge in which at least 
10 intellectuals have been dismissed from colleges and research 
centers and an outspoken columnist for the paper dai qing was 
arrested for supporting prodemocracy protests 
in the military power struggle soldiers loyal to yang went to 
the beijing residence of defense minister qin jiwei about 640 pm 
wednesday and took him and one of his armed guards away the sources 
said 
other troopers detained the heads of the beijing guangzhou and 
nanjing military districts who supported qin and were in beijing 
for an important meeting they said 
control of the military is essential in highlevel chinese 
politics senior leader deng xiaopings only official post is 
chairman of the central military commission chinas top military 
body 
qin and yang have been competing to become first vice chairman of 
the commission left vacant by zhaos dismissal june 24 
one source said the soldiers were from the garrison headquarters 
of beijing a special force that protects military and political 
leaders and is directed by president yang 
the sources said they believed qin and the others went 
unwillingly but did not say they were kidnapped or arrested they 
said they did not know the mens whereabouts 
no confirmation of the reports was possible but the sources 
contacted the associated press separately one is a military officer 
who telephoned thursday morning from beijing and the other is a 
businessman based in hong kong who says he has extensive contacts 
within the chinese military 
zhao was purged because of he allegedly supported student 
demonstrations for sweeping political change in china which ended 
with the bloody military crackdown of june 34 
chinese sources had said earlier that qin was against imposing 
martial law in beijing and the use of force to clear tiananmen 
square 
according to the sources qin and several commanders met with 
former defense minister zhang aiping and yang dezhi former army 
chief of staff on aug 8 to discuss qins possible appointment to 
zhaos former military post 
among the officials accompanying qin were zhou yibing commander 
of the beijing military area xiang shouzhi commander of the 
nanjing area and zhang wannian the guangzhou commander they said 
zhang aiping and yang dezhi who opposed a violent crackdown on 
the democracy movement in a letter written in late may expressed 
support for qin the sources reported 
the central military commission met the next day to choose a 
first vice chairman but took no action because qin and yang argued 
and qin walked out one of the sources said 
both said the meeting was adjourned until this week but that 
wednesdays developments had placed it in doubt 
yuan the chinese government spokesman said wang a 20yearold 
beijing university student who helped lead the prodemocracy 
movement was arrested july 2 after meeting with a taiwanese 
reporter who was detained and later expelled 
an interview published wednesday in the japanese newspaper 
yomiuri quoted him as saying the communist party continued 
investigating links between the demonstrators and zhao 
if it is determined that zhao took part in the turmoil or had 
a role in planning and leading it it will cease to be an internal 
party matter but i am not saying it will definitely lead to 
criminal proceedings he said 
yuan said without elaboration that zhao and hu qili another 
moderate party leader also purged for opposing the army crackdown 
were leading normal lives 
china will not use force to pry dissident astrophysicist fang 
and his wife from their refuge in the us embassy he said but 
they will not be allowed to leave the country even for a third 
neutral nation 
he said resolution of the diplomatic standoff lies with the 
us government whoever started the trouble should end it

aids has reached a new milestone in the united 
states with more than 100000 cases of the deadly disease reported 
according to the federal centers for disease control 
through july 102621 cases of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome were reported in the united states the cdc said this week 
a total of 59391 or 58 percent of those patients have died 
as scientists have noted since aids was discovered in 1981 the 
case count is growing at a faster pace as the disease spreads the 
first 50000 aids cases in the united states were reported from 1981 
to late 1987 but the next 50000 were reported from december 1987 
to july 1989 
us health officials estimate 1 million to 15 million americans 
are infected with hiv or human immunodeficiency virus which causes 
aids a study among homosexual or bisexual males the largest risk 
group for aids suggests that up to 99 percent of those infected 
will eventually develop the disease 
aids continues to occur increasingly among abusers of injectable 
drugs in the first six months of 1989 23 percent of reported aids 
patients were female or heterosexual male users of intravenous 
drugs compared with 18 percent among the cases reported before 
1985 the cdc said 
fiftysix percent of the cases reported in the first half of this 
year were among homosexual or bisexual males compared with 63 
percent prior to 1985 
overall homosexual or bisexual men make up 60 percent of the 
102621 reported aids cases twenty percent are intravenous drug 
abusers and 7 percent are both four percent of aids cases are 
blamed on heterosexual contact 
the virus that causes aids damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread 
most often through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by 
drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from pregnant 
women to their offspring

authorities have restricted fruit and vegetable 
shipments from a 70squaremile area around dodger stadium to keep 
mediterranean fruit flies confined to the los angeles area the 
agriculture department said thursday 
larry b slagle acting administrator of the departments animal 
and health inspection service said the quarantine and other 
measures were ordered following the discovery in the last three 
weeks of 40 adult medflies and 40 larvae in a threemilesquare area 
of the county 
the quarantine restricts the movement of all fruits and 
vegetables leaving the area he said 
medflies are considered among the most destructive pests of 
fruits and vegetables females lay eggs inside ripe fruit and 
vegetables and the developing larvae feed on the pulp destroying 
their commercial and nutritive values slagle said 
an aerial drop of sexually sterile medflies is scheduled to begin 
aug 21 
by releasing large numbers of sterile flies we eliminate the 
possibility of two fertile medflies mating so the pest literally 
breeds itself out of existence slagle said

the communist party on thursday opened the 
possibility of radical change in the soviet unions structure by 
offering new powers to the republics and a possible rewrite of the 
agreement that united them 
the party leadership tendered the proposal published in its 
newspaper pravda as its solution to the ethnic conflicts that 
threaten to rip apart the soviet union more than 200 people have 
died in ethnic strife in the past 18 months and groups in several 
of the 15 republics are calling for secession 
in its proposals the party offers no specific solutions to stem 
the ethnic hatred that has led to clashes involving armenians 
azerbaijanis abkhazians georgians turks uzbeks and others some 
activists welcomed the partys attempt to compromise but said vague 
promises of decentralization are no longer enough to solve the 
nationalities question 
the only solution is for the republics to be absolutely free 
said nodar notadze head of the peoples front in georgia 
the draft policy also calls for a law banning nationalist and 
chauvinist organizations which could be used against groups 
demanding independence from moscow 
the greatest concession offers the republics the power to 
question national laws before a strengthened high court 
that clause appeared to be aimed at estonia latvia and 
lithuania which have amended their constitutions to proclaim their 
right to reject national laws the kremlin previously said this 
violated the soviet constitution 
thursdays document said that to achieve a transformation of the 
soviet federation the question has been raised of working out and 
signing a new union agreement instead of the treaty on the formation 
of the ussr of 1922 
that could be limited to the partys suggestion of expanded 
powers for republics but it opens the possibility that radicals 
could push through radical change such as andrei d sakharovs 
suggested loose confederation of sovereign states or even the 
breakup of the union into independent states 
the 1922 treaty created the ussr as a union of allegedly 
sovereign republics which were in reality dominated by the kremlin 
in moscow 
estonian activists originally suggested rewriting the treaty of 
union in november when they made world headlines by becoming the 
first of the baltics to declare their republic sovereign within 
the framework of the soviet union 
by thursday however baltic activists were no longer excited by 
the possibility 
we dont want a new agreement said aigar irgens an editor 
at atmoda the newspaper of the latvian popular front we want 
complete independence 
they are trying to present to the world that we in the soviet 
union now have a federation built on the will of the people said 
alvydas juozaitis of the lithuanian popular front sajudis that is 
impossible as long as the red army occupies the republic he 
said 
sajudis which swept parliamentary elections in lithuania in the 
spring and openly advocates independence is not prepared to sign 
a new agreement with the soviet union until the soviet union 
renounces our occupation juozaitis said 
the draft approved by the ruling party politburo is expected to 
be discussed in the party central committees of the republics prior 
to the meeting of the 250member national central committee next 
month in moscow 
the document indicates the party leadership still favors a strong 
central government despite its willingness to transfer certain 
powers to the republics 
for example it says the republics can raise the question of 
canceling national laws they believe exceed the authority of the 
central government but it claims for the moscowbased government 
the far stronger power to veto unconstitutional laws passed in the 
republics 
the party suggests that such disputes be settled by the 
constitutional control commission a quasisupreme court that was 
created last year 
the partys call for a new law banning nationalist and 
chauvinist organizations could be targeted at prosecession groups 
such as the party of national independence in georgia russian 
strikers protesting a new language law in estonia or the 
massmembership estonian popular front which supported the language 
law 
we have nationalist groups in latvia but the term is very 
broad irgens said the effect of the partys proposed ban he 
said would depend on the definition of nationalist 
the draft includes the promise to give to the republics all 
rights related to their status as sovereign socialist states and 
says they are empowered to solve problems except in those areas 
where they give control to the national government 
the soviet constitution is contradictory on this point promising 
sovereignty to the republics but simultaneously claiming that 
national law is superior the proposed policy does not clear up some 
of that fuzziness 
it grants the republics demand for the right to use and 
distribute their land and natural resources but it also reserves to 
the national government the right to determine the allunion 
basis of how resources should be used 
the division of economic power is similarly vague 
in hopes of calming national conflicts the document calls for a 
new law guaranteeing the rights of citizens living outside their 
national boundaries it also calls for creation of a new government 
entity to handle ethnic relations and local councils for 
minorities with the right to selfgovernment

the government is ending part of its trial for 
the aids drug azt because the study found it significantly slowed 
the progress of the deadly disease in certain patients the 
department of health and human services announced today 
azt also known as zidovudine was being given to participants in 
the drug trial whose blood tested positive for the aids virus but 
whose disease progression was in a very early stage 
patients in the study were those who had blood tests of fewer 
than 500 t4 blood cells per cubic millimeter half of those in the 
study received azt and the others received placebo 
hhs announced that a data and safety monitoring board found 
that those participants with fewer t4 cells who received zidovudine 
the rate of progression to aids or severe arc aidsrelated complex 
was roughly half that of participants who received placebo 
the announcement said that all patients in the trial will now 
receive azt the study continues for patients whose t4 cell count is 
above 500 
the drug trial involved more than 3200 volunteers the trial was 
begun two years ago and was conducted in 32 locations the 
announcement follows by two weeks a report that shows azt slowed 
progression of the disease in persons with early aidsrelated 
complex 
about 1300 of the participants had fewer than 500 t4 cells at 
the beginning 
these results provide real hope for the millions of people 
worldwide who are infected with the aids virus hhs secretary 
lewis w sullivan said in prepared remarks 
dr anthony s fauci director of the national institute of 
allergy and infectious diseases which was in charge of the study 
said the results have clearly demonstrated that early treatment 
with zidovudine can slow disease progression without significant 
side effects in aids patients with fewer than 500 t4 cells who do 
not yet have symptoms 
azt is currently the only antiviral drug approved to combat 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome

pope john paul ii will make his third trip 
in seven years this weekend to spain a former bastion of roman 
catholicism that is becoming increasingly secular 
some observers say the visit to the northwestern cities of 
santiago de compostela oviedo and the covadonga mountain shrine 
all important sites of early christian spain is an effort to stem 
the secularization and a dramatic decline in church attendance 
a limited abortion law and another giving the state effective 
control over religious schools both passed by the socialist 
government of prime minister felipe gonzalez took effect in 1985 
after the popes 10day trip in 1982 and a shorter visit to the 
virgin of pilar shrine in zaragoza in 1984 
divorce was made legal in 1981 six years after the death of 
dictator francisco franco under whose regime roman catholicism was 
the state religion and the church the arbiter of public and private 
morality 
in july the justice ministry declared islam under whose banner 
moorish warriors destroyed santiago de compostela in 997 a religion 
of recognized foothold in spain making moslem establishments 
eligible for taxexempt status similar decrees already had been 
issued for protestants and jews 
the highlight of john pauls trip will be the fourth 
vaticansponsored world youth day expected to attract 300000 young 
people from 60 countries to santiago on saturday when the threeday 
visit begins 
monsignor peter coughlan undersecretary of the vaticans council 
for the laity said the purpose was to demonstrate churchs emphasis 
on youth and evangelization his agency organized the event 
polls indicate half the spaniards under age 25 believe in god 
polls in the archbishopric of oviedo which the pope will visit 
sunday say 22 percent of those aged 1830 call themselves 
practicing catholics 
a study by the archbishops office said only 176 percent of the 
11 million inhabitants of asturias of which oviedo is the capital 
considered themselves active church members 
advance press coverage has focused on the financing of the visit 
and the use of public funds to pay for the estimated 5000 police 
needed to keep order and guard john paul 
although the visit is not official the pontiff will meet with 
both king juan carlos and gonzalez the prime minister 
cardinal angel suquia archbishop of madrid and head of spanish 
conference of bishops acknowledged problems with who is to pay 
what for what 
the bishops have not said what the papal visit will cost but 
gabino diaz merchan archbishop of oviedo told the state radio the 
church was spending 300000 on the visit to his diocese 
nueva espana an oviego daily said the asturias government 
contributed part of the 165000 needed to refurbish the covadonga 
shrine 
cavadonga in the picos de europa mountain range 50 miles 
southeast of oviedo houses the 18th century statue of the virgin of 
the battlefield or santina patron of asturias 
galicia of which santiago is the capital is providing 165 
million to help pay for the visit and accommodations for the young 
visitors said david cheda provincial government spokesman

fees to food and soft drink concessionaires 
archbishop antonio maria rouco varela of santiago said john

president wojciech jaruzelski will choose a 
solidarity member to lead polands next government a lawmaker said 
thursday a move that would end four decades of communist domination 
the stunning development came during a historic meeting between 
jaruzelski and lech walesa whose solidarity labor movement was 
crushed by jaruzelski eight years ago but which has now become 
polands most potent political force 
solidarity lawmaker jacek kuron said jaruzelski accepted in 
principle walesas offer to form a government led by 
noncommunists such a government would be unprecedented in the 
soviet bloc 
i am satisfied walesa said after the meeting 
even in a government led by solidarity however jaruzelski would 
remain president controlling the army and foreign affairs local 
governments would still be in the hands of the communist party and 
party members would still control the courts in addition tens of 
thousands of polands bureaucrats owe their jobs to the party and 
75 percent of management jobs ranging from shop managers to 
factory heads are held by party members 
the possibility of a noncommunist government in warsaw has 
alarmed the soviet union polands superpower neighbor and ally but 
the soviets have always stressed that political changes in poland 
were an internal affair in addition walesa has said that the 
interior and defense ministries would remain in communist hands 
after the meeting between walesa and jaruzelski staterun media 
announced that communist prime minister czeslaw kiszczak formally 
turned in his resignation to jaruzelski apparently as a prelude to 
the formation of a new government 
kiszczak who has been in office only since aug 2 had said 
earlier this week he would resign because the solidarityled 
opposition in parliament fought his efforts to form a coalition 
government 
walesa a gdansk shipyard electrician who built his labor 
movement as poland slid into an economic morass has said he does 
not want to become prime minister 
jaruzelski as president must nominate a prime minister and 
present him for approval to the sejm the lower house of the 
national assembly solidarity and two minor parties that are allied 
with it form a majority in that chamber 
kuron said he is among three solidarity candidates the coalition 
has offered for prime minister kuron a activist in the polish 
opposition for more than 20 years spent nine years in prison for 
antigovernment activities 
also to be considered are solidarity parliamentary leader 
bronislaw geremek a historian and tadeusz mazowiecki editor of 
the unions weekly newspaper tygodnik solidarnosc 
jaruzelski said he will grant nomination as prime minister to 
one of the solidarity candidates in the nearest future kuron told 
a gathering of solidarity lawmakers 
walesa has said any solidarityled government would appoint 
communist party members to lead the ministries of defense and 
interior which control the army and police this appeared to be a 
move to allay soviet fears about a fissure in the warsaw pact 
military alliance 
solidarity was the east blocs first independent trade union when 
it was formed in 1980 by walesa 
it was legal for 16 months and its membership ballooned to 10 
million until dec 13 1981 when jaruzelski declared martial law 
and jailed thousands of members including walesa solidarity was 
outlawed the following year 
a series of strikes caused by polands collapsing economy last 
year forced officials to seek a conciliation with the union 
resulting in a historic accord reached in april that allowed limited 
opposition participation in elections and the legalization of 
solidarity 
the trade union and its allied candidates dominated the elections 
in the sejm and the newly formed senate under the accord the 
communists were guaranteed a narrow majority in the national 
assembly 
but the defection this week of two minor parties typically 
associated with the communists the united peasant and the 
democratic parties swung the balance of power to solidarity 
jaruzelski was to make an announcement on the meeting friday and 
both government and opposition figures were vague on details 
jaruzelski agreed to the basic concept of the plan said jerzy 
jozwiak leader of the solidarityallied democratic party who 
attended the meeting the concept has been approved by the 
president he said 
an official communique issued after the meeting said jaruzelski 
would work for the quickest possible appointment of a government 
such as proposed by walesa 
lech walesa presented the concept of establishing a coalition 
government of national responsibility with the participation of all 
proreformatory political forces represented at the sejm said the 
communique carried on the state pap news agency 
jaruzelski declared that he will urgently consider the 
presented propositions and conduct appropriate consultations aiming 
at the quickest possible appointment of such a government in the 
interest of the nation it said 
walesa and jozwiak expressed satisfaction with the outcome but 
were vague about details apparently not wishing to speak until 
jaruzelski issued his written decision friday 
jozwiak said the outcome was favorable for the nation and the 
state 
after the meeting walesa went to see the leader of polands 
roman catholic church cardinal jozef glemp 
asked if the coalition leaders were close to a new government he 
added closer than farther 
asked if the president favored a government such as the coalition 
had suggested walesa replied what poland needs is agreement a 
government of reforms everybody is in favor of that so it is only 
a technical matter 
president bush was monitoring the developments in poland and the 
white house said the sensitive situation was a positive 
development 
we do encourage and support the process of pluralism and it 
appears that is the general direction that they are aimed in 
poland press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters who 
accompanied the president to maine 
certainly a noncommunist government would be a remarkable and 
historymaking occurrence he added 
there was no immediate comment from the soviet union the soviet 
tv news program vremya on thursday night showed a report that 
had been shot before the meeting with jaruzelski painting a picture

the us trade deficit shrank to 817 billion 
in june the smallest monthly imbalance since december 1984 the 
government said thursday in a report viewed by many economists as 
only a shortlived improvement 
the commerce department said the june deficit showed a dramatic 
189 percent narrowing from a revised may figure of 1008 billion 
reflecting record us export sales and a drop in imports 
the june report which was significantly better than had been 
expected was hailed by the bush administration as evidence that 
american manufacturers were enjoying continued success in 
penetrating foreign markets 
the decline in the trade deficit was greater than market 
expectation and certainly is good news for the country 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters in 
kennebunkport maine 
the june improvement came from a 15 percent increase in us 
exports which pushed them to a record level of 3091 billion and 
a 36 percent drop in imports which fell to 3908 billion 
private forecasters were decidedly less enthusiastic than the 
administration with some contending that the june deficit figure 
was likely to be the best trade news america would get for some time 
they predicted that the deficit would widen in coming months 
under the impact of a stronger dollar which makes us products 
more expensive on overseas markets 
the stock and bond markets also reacted negatively to the report 
which was interpreted as showing that economic growth was stronger 
than previously believed while such a development eases recession 
fears it also diminishes hopes that the federal reserve will move 
to lower interest rates further 
bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch amp co said the 
unexpectedly sharp improvement in the june trade figure and other 
recent good economic news would probably result in a big upward 
revision in the governments estimate of overall economic growth for 
the apriljune quarter 
the overall economy as measured by the gross national product 
was originally shown growing at a very weak 17 percent annual rate 
in the second quarter steinberg said that figure would likely be 
revised upward to around 25 percent reflecting not only better 
news on trade but also upturns in industrial production and retail 
sales 
during the period when the fed was easing monetary policy in 
the second quarter the economy was not nearly as weak as the 
central bank thought it was he said 
for the first six months of the year the trade deficit was 
running at an annual rate of 1086 billion down 84 percent from 
last years total merchandise trade deficit of 1185 billion 
but many economists believe the monthly deficits will begin 
creeping upward for the rest of the year reflecting both the 
stronger dollar and a growing appetite for foreign oil 
the american petroleum institute reported wednesday that imported 
crude and refined oil accounted for more than half the countrys 
total oil use in july the first time that has occurred in 12 years 
the june trade report is a good report but you cant jump to 
the conclusion that the trade deficit is on a downward trend said 
cynthia latta an economist at drimcgraw hill 
she predicted that the overall deficit would show only a small 
improvement this year perhaps declining to 110 billion while 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said he was 
looking for no improvement at all in the trade deficit for 1989 as a 
whole 
the improvement in exports was led by a jump in sales of us 
capital goods overseas the import decline was widespread 
reflecting lower shipments of foreign autos capital goods and oil 
americas foreign oil bill dropped 115 percent in june to 42 
billion as both the volume and price of imported oil fell however 
analysts noting the american petroleum institute report for july 
said oil imports would likely be rising for the rest of the year 
as usual the largest trade deficit in june was with japan an 
imbalance of 39 billion down from a may deficit of 43 billion 
the deficit with taiwan totaled 12 billion in june while the 
deficit with china was 700 million 
the total june deficit of 817 billion was the lowest since a 
679 billion deficit in december 1984

strikes and ethnic turmoil in the soviet union 
snarled rail lines from the baltic sea to the caucasus on thursday 
and russians in moldavia stopped work for two hours to press their 
demands on local leaders state media said 
the events showed the variety and gravity of the ethnic quarrels 
faced by soviet rulers who issued proposals thursday on interethnic 
relations those proposals gave vague promises of decentralization 
but no specific remedies for the nations often bloody nationalist 
strife 
in estonia where tens of thousands of ethnic russian workers 
have been on strike for nine days their organizers met with top 
communist party and government officials including estonian 
president arnold ruutel in an attempt to negotiate an end to the 
conflict the tass news agency said 
well go back to work immediately if we get the guarantees we 
want from estonian leaders alexei gutenov a representative of 
the strike committee said by telephone from tallinn the baltic 
republics capital 
the strike broke out because the estonian parliament voted to 
approve the first residency requirements in the soviet union for 
voting and running for office strike leaders claim the new law 
would strip 80000 russians and other migrants in estonia of the 
right to vote or seek elective office 
the national presidium on wednesday declared the estonian law 
unconstitutional in a decision approved by president mikhail s 
gorbachev well end the walkout if estonian leaders agree to 
abide by the presidiums decision and change the law gutenov said 
strike leaders claimed more than 50 enterprises in the republic 
of 16 million people have been shut by their action another joined 
the strike thursday gutenov said 
izvestia the government daily quouted railway minister n 
konarev as saying that because of the strike 3000 railcars have 
been idled in estonia of which more than 700 have been left on 
railway lines blocking dozens of trains from proceeding 
in tallinn where all stations that load and unload freight have 
been paralyzed by the walkout 34 trains carrying perishable 
foodstuffs and other goods are waiting to be discharged konarev 
said 
according to tass the strike committee has said the question of 
whether or nt to suspend the strike will be decided by a vote 
russian workers also flexed their muscles in moldavia a small 
soviet republic on the border with romania frightened by a proposed 
law that would make moldavian the republics official language 
russian workers in tiraspol moldavias secondlargest city staged 
a twohour warning strike wednesday 
tass said the working people of tiraspol and in other moldavian 
cities where nonmoldavians make up nearly 40 percent of the 
population demanded the language proposal be changed to protect 
their interests 
were convinced strikes are an extreme measure of resolving 
labor disputes sergei mikhailov a strike leader in tiraspol 
told tass but the alarming sociopolitical situation in moldavia 
forced us to do it 
russians and other nonmoldavians fear they will be put at a 
disadvantage if the proposed law requires a knowledge of the local 
language for those seeking certain jobs 
similar measures have been enacted in the baltic republics and 
russians in moldavia fear the language law will be the first step 
down the same road pursued by nationalist activist in estonia 
latvia and lithuania moldavias parliament is scheduled to meet 
aug 29 to debate the measure 
ethnic strife in the soviet caucasus republic of azerbaijan has 
also disrupted rail service as far north as the volga basin the 
izvestia report said last year armenians and azerbaijanis began a 
long bloody quarrel over the status of nagornokarabakh a mostly 
armenian enclave inside azerbaijan 
izvestia said a railway bridge had been destroyed near 
stepanakert the enclaves administrative center earlier this week 
about 200 people surged onto the tracks at velidag in an attempt to 
disrupt rail service it said near karchivan azerbaijan somebody 
tried to blow up the railbed but blew himself up while trying to 
place the bomb izvestia said

the federal deficit is on a path leading to 
128 billion of red ink in 1993 when the law requires the budget 
to be in balance the congressional budget office said thursday 
in the short run even if congress fully implements an agreement 
worked out with the white house the deficit will be 118 billion in 
1990 or 18 billion above the target set by the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law cbo projected 
and for budget year 1991 which begins in less than 14 months a 
127 billion deficit 63 billion above the figure allowed by law 
was forecast 
clearly this implies congress and the administration are going 
to face a very difficult challenge in fiscal year 1991 cbo 
director robert s reischauer told a news conference cutting the 
1991 deficit to the target level would require a deficitreduction 
effort more than twice as large as any previous plan he said 
the key message is that we have a very long way to go if the 
deficit is to be brought down to a level americans will be 
comfortable with reischauer said 
the cbo figures indicate a deficit each year that would be large 
enough to force acrosstheboard spending cuts in most federal 
programs as required by the grammrudman law however it is 
forecasts from the white house office of management and budget that 
determine whether those reductions will be made and the omb is 
expected to project deficits low enough to avoid the mandated 
spending cuts 
omb forecasts will be made public monday 
reischauer made his comments as cbo issued a fiveyear economic 
forecast of continued slow growth gradually declining shortterm 
interest rates inflation in the 46 percent range and a slight 
increase in unemployment 
cbos economic forecasts are less optimistic than those of omb 
which accounts for a big share of the difference between the two 
agencies outlook for the deficit 
assuming congress fully implements the deficitcutting plan 
worked out with the administration and if onetimeonly collections 
from selling government assets are not counted reischauer said the 
cbo figures indicate a 1990 deficit of 124 billion or 24 billion 
above the grammrudman maximum such a shortfall would result in 24 
billion in spending cuts divided evenly between defense and 
domestic programs 
however the administration projection is likely to show a 105 
billion deficit which would be 5 billion below the level that 
would trigger automatic spending cuts reischauer said 
deficit reduction will be a major issue when congress returns to 
washington after the august recess lawmakers face an oct 15 
deadline two weeks after the start of budget year 1990 for 
completing work to implement the deficitcutting agreement with the 
white house 
the major proposal under consideration would cut the deficit by 
about 13 billion by reducing spending and raising new revenues 
almost 9 billion of the 24billion package of deficit reduction 
for 1990 would come from accounting changes and onetime 
collections including asset sales 
deficit reduction reischauer said is a political problem as 
much as it is an economic problem the american people have to send 
a message to their legislators 
that message he added should indicate a willingness to accept 
some shortterm pain as the price for longterm improvement in the 
governments budget policies 
continued high deficits could lower the nations standard of 
living reduce the governments ability to influence the economy 
and boost international interest rates which would drain resources 
from poorer countries reischauer said 
asked if the deficit can be cut significantly without raising 
taxes reischauer replied the more programs and policies that are 
under consideration the easier it will be to craft a 
deficitreduction package 
cbo estimates this years deficit at 161 billion

a federal judge thursday ordered former 
washington lawyer william borders to testify in the senate 
impeachment trial of us district court judge alcee hastings 
us district court judge george revercomb said borders must 
respond to questions from the senate panel considering the hastings 
matter or face a possible contempt of court order which could send 
the prominent onetime lawyer to jail 
revercomb said a june 27 immunity order by us district court 
judge louis oberdorfer was proper and that sanctions would be 
imposed if it is violated 
you must testify before the senate impeachment trial 
committee or show cause why he should not be held in contempt 
revercomb told borders who served nearly three years in prison for 
his conviction in a bribe conspiracy allegedly involving hastings 
senate legal counsel michael davidson said he would check to 
determine how soon a committee meeting can be scheduled so that 
borders can be called 
borders was subpoenaed to testify before the senate panel but 
twice refused to answer questions on july 24 and july 27 
hastings and his close friend borders were charged in 1981 with 
conspiring to accept a 150000 bribe in exchange for agreeding to 
reduce the sentences of two convicted criminals to probation and 
returning nearly 1 million in forfeited property 
borders was convicted while hastings was acquitted in a separate 
trial 
the house voted a year ago to impeach hastings for bribery and 
perjury in connection with the case in which he was acquitted and 
also for allegedly leaking confidential wiretap information in a 
separate case 
borders attorney michael rosier argued against ordering his 
client to testify rosier said in court papers filed earlier this 
week that the courtauthorized grant of immunity to borders was 
defective 
rosier said the senate trial committee failed to notify the 
attorney general at least 10 days in advance of the panels 
intention to seek courtauthorized immunity for borders rosier also 
raised constitutional concerns saying that forcing him to testify 
amounted to cruel and unusual punishment 
borders has paid his debt to society by serving nearly three 
years in federal prison for conspiring to bribe hastings said the 
court papers the conduct of the government in its constant 
efforts to force mr borders testimony has now reached the level 
that it shocks the conscience and violates fundamental principles of 
fairness justice and decency 
borders has the right to be free from the constant threat of 
incarceration his lawyers said 
revercomb said that under the immunity order borders always 
has a right to relieve himself of incarceration by testifying to 
the senate

afghanistan claimed thursday that the 
united states was supplying the anticommunist guerrillas with new 
rockets that explode in the air and shower warheads which detonate 
on the ground 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said reporters on 
friday would be shown pieces of the rockets which he did not name 
but said had us markings 
the united states has said it is providing the guerrillas with 
new weapons to counter arms shipments to the afghan government from 
the soviet union published reports say these include cluster bombs 
and spanish 120mm mortars designed to crater airport runways 
it is a longrange ustype missile its very strong and it 
can destroy vast areas amani said you can see the us 
markings 
he said the guerrillas fired 53 missiles including the 
previously unused rockets at kabul late tuesday and early wednesday 
one of the new rockets killed five civilians and injured 23 
others in the former sovietoccupied mikrorayan housing complex near 
kabul airport now home to many government workers amani said one 
of the victims was a child who picked up a piece of rocket that then 
exploded he said 
he said casualties were low because the attack was at night and 
most people were asleep 
but i can assure you that if they continue firing these new 
rockets the people will suffer casualties and their hatred against 
the opponent groups and the united states of america will 
increase amani said 
explaining how the new rocket worked amani said it exploded at 
some point in the air and its 30 warheads then exploded on the 
ground 
even its pieces have exploded sometimes after one hour without 
being touched he said 
the government has said that in the last four weeks 354 rockets 
hit kabul killing 193 civilians and injuring more than 500 
most of the rockets fired at kabul are egyptianmade sakers with 
a range of up to 25 miles 
the guerrillas have claimed responsibility for some attacks but 
not those in recent days they claim the government aims rockets at 
civilian targets to discredit them 
the united states and the soviet union have accused each other of 
escalating the arms race in the 11year afghan war since soviet 
troops pulled out in february 
last week the us government said the soviets were supplying 
afghanistan with mig29 fighters and the latest su27 ground attack 
jets to be used in the event of a pakistani attack 
the afghan government has confounded western predictions of a 
quick guerrilla victory after the soviet pullout the army has 
repulsed guerrilla attacks on several major provincial cities 
including towns near the border with pakistan such as jalalabad

a year later mystery still surrounds 
the plane crash that killed president mohammed zia ulhaq us 
ambassador arnold raphel and 28 other people on aug 17 1988 
us and pakistani investigators all but ruled out technical 
failure on the presidential plane a sturdy fourengine lockheed 
c130 turboprop known as pak one 
their report said the most probable cause was a criminal act or 
sabotage but did not say by whom gen zias son speaks of a 
coverup 
the plane climbed into a clear sky over the sutlej river near the 
indian border behaved erratically three minutes later then dived 
into a sandy plain and exploded killing everyone aboard 
in addition to zia and raphel the dead included the us 
military attache and most of zias top military officers 
some pakistanis believe it was an assassination by domestic 
political enemies zia accumulated during 11 years of military rule 
others prefer a foreign motive 
investigators said the explosion and fire obliterated most clues 
but they found residues of chemicals that could if combined be 
used in a detonator 
ghulam ishaq khan president of the senate assumed the 
presidency and declared zia a martyr bolstering the belief that the 
general was murdered 
zias death opened the way three months later for the first 
free elections in more than a decade the opposition pakistan 
peoples party won and its leader benazir bhutto became the first 
woman prime minister in the islamic world 
the uspakistani investigation report parts of which were made 
public said the plane could have been put out of control by 
mechanical or deliberate interference with the flight control 
system interference with cockpit controls disabling of the pilots 
or explosive devices used to achieve one of those results 
a popular theory holds that the six crew members were knocked out 
by traceless nerve gas possibly by someone aboard another says a 
small explosive device damaged some critical part of the flight 
control system 
suspicion fell on four groups 
agents of afghanistans communist government possibly trained 
by the soviet kgb secret police zia with us support was a 
staunch supporter of moslem guerrillas in the neighboring country 
domestic political foes especially those loyal to ms bhutto 
zia overthrew her father zulfikar ali bhutto in a 1977 military 
coup and he was hanged two years later 
pakistans minority shiite moslems because of the assassination 
of their spiritual leader a month earlier 
agents of india the two nations have fought three wars since 
1947 when the subcontinent was divided and they became independent 
of britain 
zias son ijaz ulhaq said he believed the bhutto family was 
involved and the new government was covering up 
i am certain that alzulfikar had a hand in it ijaz 38 
said in an interview with the associated press i have evidence 
but if i made it public now id be eliminated 
his reference was to an organization named for the prime 
ministers father and once run by benazirs brother murtaza who 
lives in syria 
murtaza and another brother now deceased planned a pakistan 
airlines hijacking in 1981 that forced zia to release 52 political 
prisoners the hijackers killed a passenger they claimed had 
betrayed bhutto while serving under him 
benazir bhutto has said her brother must face charges of air 
piracy if he returns to pakistan 
an alzulfikar member in london claimed responsibility for the 
pak one crash but later recanted the bhutto family and officials 
of the governing party have denied any involvement or coverup 
the uspakistani report recommended a separate investigation of 
possible criminal acts president ishaq khan appointed fk bandial 
a career civil servant with few political connections to conduct it 
no findings have been published when asked by the associated 
press bandial would not say how many people were involved or 
whether they had made progress 
the investigation is still in hand he said whatever we 
send to the government will be private

president bushs chief spokesman said 
thursday that bush supports polands move toward a remarkable and 
historymaking noncommunist government 
the vacationing president was keeping close tabs on polish 
developments said presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
while the summer white house reacted cautiously to thursdays 
reports of polish president wojciech jaruzelskis approval of 
solidarity leader lech walesas plan for a coalition government 
officials privately were enthusiastic 
two years ago no one in the united states would have predicted 
this could happen of course were happy extremely happy said a 
senior administration official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
bush passed up an opportunity to react to developments in poland 
directly asked about the situation by reporters between holes on a 
local golf course he said no comment 
fitzwater said bush who voiced strong support for recent 
political reforms during his trip to poland last month was not 
endorsing walesa or any other candidate to head what would be the 
first noncommunist government in the soviet bloc 
it is a sensitive situation there in terms of the general 
movement away from the communist control fitzwater said he said 
bush remained determined not to do anything or say anything to 
upset the apple cart were very reluctant to involve ourselves 
in a more direct fashion 
still fitzwater said theres really not much question of his 
support and his thinking on that matter 
the spokesman disclosed bush and walesa discussed the possibility 
of walesa becoming prime minister when the two had lunch in gdansk 
last month 
walesa has voiced reservations this week about accepting the post 
fitzwater said bush and walesa talked about the political 
process and the prospects and about lech walesas personal feelings 
about his role the president understands the various pressures 
that are on mr walesa and he walesa is very concerned about the 
new government about solidaritys ability to step in and take over 
the new government 
aides said bush was told of the latest development jaruzelskis 
acceptance of walesas plan when he returned from a morning 
boating and fishing trip on the first full day of a threeweek 
vacation at his oceanside home 
were watching the situation we continue to watch the 
situation but there are still many unanswered questions 
fitzwater said 
certainly a noncommunist government would be a remarkable and 
historymaking occurrence the spokesman said 
he said that the white house would have no further comment on the 
situation in poland until theres much clearer direction on what 
happens next 
bush was receiving briefings on the developments in poland from 
deputy national security adviser robert m gates 
during his visit to poland bush announced a threeyear 119 
million package of economic aid to reward poland for steps toward 
democracy 
we would not try to intrude in the internal affairs of poland 
to the point of suggesting one form of government or another 
fitzwater said we do encourage and support the process of 
pluralism and it appears that that is the general direction that 
they are aiming

a federal appeals court thursday struck down a 
jurys 94 million award against soldier of fortune magazine made 
to relatives of a woman murdered by a mercenary hired through a 
classified advertisement 
e barrett prettyman jr an appeals attorney for soldier of 
fortune said thursday that publisher robert brown was ecstatic 
over the ruling which prettyman called a first amendment victory 
for the publishing industry 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled that a houston jury 
had imposed too high a standard on the magazine adding that 
publishers could be discouraged from running other ambiguously 
worded ads if the award were upheld 
the kind of duty the plaintiffs were attempting to impose here 
would not only have put this magazine out of business but would 
have had an extraordinarily harmful effect on magazines and 
publishers of all kinds prettyman said 
it should be a great relief for all those protected by the 
first amendment prettyman said 
robert black was convicted of hiring hit man john wayne hearn to 
kill his wife sandra black in february 1985 through an ad that 
read ex marines 6769 vets exdi weapons specialist jungle 
warfare pilot me highrisk assignments us or overseas 
robert black is now on texas death row and hearn is in florida 
serving three life sentences for the black killing and two other 
murders 
soldier of fortunes lawyers argued in a june 5th circuit hearing 
that there was no way the magazines publishers could have known the 
cryptic ad was actually a solicitation for murder the ad appeared 
in a 1984 issue 
john roberson representing mrs blacks son gary 19 and 
mother marjorie eimann 65 said during the hearing that high 
risk assignment clearly meant gun for hire in the lingo of the 
magazine 
however judge w eugene davis disagreed when writing on behalf 
of the threejudge 5th circuit panel thursday 
the burden on a publisher to avoid liability from suits of this 
type is too great davis wrote 
without a more specific indication of illegal intent than 
hearns ad or its context provided we conclude that soldier of 
fortune did not violate the standard of conduct by publishing an ad 
that later played a role in criminal activity he wrote 
although the magazine said the judgment against it had been a 
violation of press freedoms under the first amendment davis said 
the court didnt need to address first amendment arguments he wrote 
that under texas liability law the magazine had no duty to refrain 
from publishing an ambiguously worded ad 
roberson and other attorneys for the plaintiffs did not 
immediately return telephone calls when asked to comment on 
thursdays ruling

karim obeid the shiite moslem cleric kidnapped by israel told 
interrogators he believed two of the three israeli soldiers taken 
prisoner in lebanon were dead 
it was the first israeli confirmation of a report of the 
soldiers deaths in the sunday times of london 
officials also said however that obeids belief was based on 
secondhand information and they seriously doubted its reliability 
israels policy is that soldiers are considered alive until there 
is proof of their deaths officials said they would investigate the 
source of the leak to the london paper

28 israel has offered to trade him and hundreds of other lebanese

proiranian group thought to sponsor hostagetakers

told last week about what the captive said and knew this 
information from obeids interrogation before the leak israel 
television reported 
a senior defense ministry official apeaking on condition of 
anonymity said obeid told investigators he heard from somebody 
that soldiers yossi fink and rahamim alsheik died after shiite 
extremists captured them in february 1986 
the sunday times said israeli officials considered obeids 
statements accurate 
that is not true finks father mordechai said in a 
telephone interview he said he was in constant touch with military 
officials who told him they had no substantial information 
whatsoever on his sons fate

the drug enforcement administration is 
investigating whether an agent arrested in boston while allegedly 
attempting to deliver cocaine revealed any information on dea 
operations to drug traffickers a spokesman said thursday 
there is an internal security investigation going on 
concerning agent edward k obrien 44 said spokesman frank shults 
who declined to reveal details of the probe 
obrien an 18year veteran of the agency was arrested late 
monday at bostons logan international airport while allegedly 
delivering suitcases filled with 62 pounds of cocaine to informants 
authorities said 
a bail hearing scheduled for thursday before a us magistrate 
was postponed until aug 24 
shults rejected as having no factual basis a published report 
that during the investigation of obrien by the deas office of 
professional responsibility allegations surfaced linking obrien to 
a major miamitoboston cocainedistribution ring that allegedly 
remains the target of an independent dea probe 
there is no dea investigation of such a ring shults said 
while the dea is probing many east coast drugtrafficking rings he 
said none was known to be associated with mr obrien 
asked whether the agency were checking all of its ongoing probes 
to see if there might be some connection to obrien he said that 
gets back to our internal investigation 
shults denied that in order to protect an agency investigation 
of the drug ring he was attempting to debunk an article in 
thursdays washington post 
he noted that obrien was arrested in connection with a sting 
operation it was a controlled delivery arranged by the dea in 
miami to somebody in boston arranged and controlled by dea at both 
ends shults said 
obrien faces charges of possession with intent to distribute 
more than five kilograms 11 pounds of cocaine and if convicted 
could be sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined up to 4 million 
obrien received 14000 to transport the drugs and was expecting 
to receive another 14000 in boston said dea special agent john j 
coleman in boston last month coleman said dea watched as obrien 
obtained about 55 pounds of cocaine and sham cocaine and brought it 
to boston for 25000 
the internal dea investigation an administration source said 
may involve a check of the agencys computer indexing system to see 
if obrien used it to get information on drug investigations in 
which he was not involved 
from may 1988 until last month obrien was a staff coordinator 
within the international programs office overseeing dea operations 
in europe and the middle east he was assigned last month to prepare 
a drug law enforcement museum for the deas new headquarters from 
1982 to 1988 he was agentincharge in springfield mass 
coleman said tuesday that obrien was in charge of many 
successful dea sting operations and that they had worked together in 
southern france trying to uncover heroin labs in the 1970s those 
were the hotbeds of activity in the french connection days he 
said

an environmental group accused the 
environmental protection agency on thursday of contributing to 
increased air pollution by promoting the burning of toxic wastes 
the epa issued a statement saying the group seriously 
distorts the agencys role in the disposal of such wastes and that 
its primary goal is to promote waste reduction not a particular 
method of disposal or treatment 
the national toxics campaign fund a private organization that 
focuses on toxic pollution issues told a news conference outside 
the agencys headquarters epas policies will encourage more toxic 
waste production 
the group argued that the epa does not focus enough in getting 
companies and industrial plants to invest in technology that would 
reduce toxic emissions 
instead the critics maintained agency policy requires state and 
local officials to develop new toxic disposal facilities such as 
additional landfills or incinerators 
new disposal capacity will only encourage toxic waste 
production said the group it said putting such wastes in 
landfills risks pollution through leakage and the burning toxic 
wastes results in the release of massive quanities of toxic fumes 
and carcinogenic compunds into the air 
the only thing were prompting is waste reduction said epa 
spokeswoman robin woods were encouraging states to consider 
all waste reduction opportunities secondly were looking at them to 
look at existing disposal facilities out of state and as a last 
resort build new facilities 
she said that the epa requires strict emission controls when 
toxic wastes are burned 
congress has directed states to certify by next october to the 
epa that they have enough toxic waste disposal capacity to manage 
wastes generated over the next 20 years 
ms woods said the epa has yet to receive any of the state toxic 
waste disposal plans that are due oct 17 and that she could not say 
to what extent states intend to rely on incineration

it was a busy day for the stocky man in the 
graying mustache and patron saints pin lech walesa shipyard 
worker and nobel peace prize winner was trying to form the first 
noncommunist government in the soviet bloc 
the solidarity and black madonna badges were prominent on his 
lapel as always when walesa emerged from the europejski hotel 
shortly before 9 am thursday wearing a natty plaid jacket 
he stepped into a dented dullgray polonez car flying a 
solidarity flag and his driver sped away with a convoy of camera 
crews and journalists in pursuit 
his first stop was the headquarters of the small united peasant 
party where walesa hoped to enlist party leader roman malinowski in 
a coalition 
this is something really new for us the switchboard operator 
said as walesa strode in the party was allied with the communists 
for years but has become more independent 
an hour later walesa came out beaming with an agreeable 
malinowski in tow 
the polonez just as dull and dented despite its occupants 
political success negotiated congested streets to the headquarters 
of the democratic party another small group with a history similar 
to the united peasants 
less than an hour later party leader jerzy jozwiak had agreed to 
join the coalition 
another walesa grin for the cameras into the polonez and back to 
the hotel 
just after noon walesa was off again to a palace in a wooded 
park near the vistula river to seal the deal with solidaritys 
coalition partners 
a guard slammed the door and reporters took shelter under the 
trees from the hot sun 
another hour and another picture this time of the three men 
with walesa in the middle raising the hands of his new partners high 
i dont have to say anything he said this picture says it 
all now to work 
lunch in the cavernous hotel dining room drew a crowd it became 
a working meal with bronislaw geremek leader of solidaritys 
parliamentary delegation and andrzej stelmachowski marshal of the 
senate 
walesa had been open and talkative all morning but the mood 
changed when he left for belvedere palace the official residence of 
president wojciech jaruzelski to present his proposal for a 
coalition government 
two soldiers guarded the entrance as walesa malinowski and 
jozwiak arrived in separate cars at 3 pm 
an hour went by then a familiar red peugeot with only a driver 
turned into the palace drive 
kiszczak the reporters said gen czeslaw kiszczak the 
prime minister elected by parliament had arrived 
after another hour the meeting ended walesa assessed the 
meeting through the glass of a car window with the single word 
good 
back at the hotel dozens of reporters followed him to his room 
hoping for news of his encounter with the stolid general in dark 
glasses whose declaration of martial law in december 1981 sent 
solidarity into eight years of limbo 
resolute and brief walesa said jaruzelski favored the coalition 
concept and that kiszczak had resigned he pushed his way into the 
room and closed the door 
less than an hour later the drab faithful polonez took walesa 
to parliament for a meeting of senators and deputies elected with 
solidarity backing in junes partially free elections 
once more to the hotel then to the residence of cardinal jozef 
glemp the roman catholic primate of poland 
there was no rush here for the devout man who so often seeks 
advice from pope john paul ii a fellow pole 
he spent an hour with the cardinal and a reporter asked when he 
came out what next 
sleep walesa replied ending a day no one dreamed when he 
vaulted the lenin shipyards fence in gdansk nine years ago to lead 
the strike in which solidarity was born

relocation in nicaragua or third countries of the nicaraguan 
resistance and their families 
central american presidents agreed earlier this month to disband 
the socalled contras by middecember in return nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega agreed to hold free and fair elections in 
february 
about 11000 contras and 12000 dependents live in camps in 
honduras since the us congress cut off their military aid last 
year they have received 45 million monthly in humanitaritan 
assistance 
the sandinista government and the contras agreed march 21 to 
suspend offensive operations but talks aimed at a permanent end to 
the 7yearold war stand at an impasse 
the white house has agreed to abide by the tela plan but insists 
the rebels must voluntarily agree to disband many rebel leaders 
have said they will not 
the united nations and oas however could help persuade them 
the central american leaders say in addition honduras has said it 
will cooperate with the plan and nicaragua has offered to help 
resettle the rebels 
nicaraguan deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco said 
returning contras will be given land and all other aid to which 
nicaraguan peasant farmers are entitled

dan rostenkowski on thursday and briefly blocked his car from 
leaving a meeting with community leaders opposing his stance on the 
comprehensive health care act 
members of the crowd yelling liar liar impeach 
impeach and we wont forget at election time followed 
rostenkowski when he left his car and walked to a location a block 
away while his car was driven around the crowd he then was able to 
get back in the car which drove off 
during the walk rostenkowski refused to acknowledge the 
gathering crowds or answer reporters questions his only comment 
was i dont think they understand whats going on thats too 
bad 
rostenkowski began his day at a community center in the northwest 
side chicago district that for 30 years has sent him to congress 
where he is chairman of the house ways and means committee 
he discussed his support for the controversial catastrophic 
health care law during a private 90minute meeting with 
representatives of six organizations representing senior citizens 
jerry prete president of the illinois state council of senior 
citizens said rostenkowski wasnt receptive to suggestions made 
during the session 
prete said the group leaders hoped to persuade rostenkowski to 
oppose measures that would shift more of the cost of health care to 
seniors 
although the meeting may not have gone smoothly rostenkowskis 
real troubles began after he left the meeting and refused to address 
200 people who had gathered in an auditorium outside the private 
meeting room 
as he made his way toward the door rostenkowski was roundly 
booed and many of those present followed him onto the streets 
we told him we werent going to boo prete said we said we 
were going to show respect 
rostenkowski walked past the group and climbed into his car 
people in the crowd several carrying signs reading read our 
lips catastrophic plan is a catastrophe then surrounded the car 
and one woman refused to move from in front of the vehicle 
we think this man is inhumane said lawrence dobson 67 who 
was part of the gathering hes not answering the questions or 
needs of the people is he afraid of senior citizens 
the catastrophic health insurance program would improve benefits 
for the 200 million people or 85 percent of americans who are 
underinsured against catastrophic longterm illness 
higher income retirees who pay most of the cost of the program 
have been lobbying the committee to spread the cost among all 
taxpayers not just older citizens

soldiers blocked 
about 1000 palestinians from entering israel thursday in a test of 
new id cards that have intensified the struggle between israeli 
authorities and palestinian leaders 
officials said about 5000 other palestinians got through the 
erez checkpoint during the fourhour test because they had applied 
for and received the identification cards which will be required of 
all gazans who want to enter israel starting friday 
officials have said they may extend the new system to the west 
bank 
the experiment came off without violence unlike five days 
earlier when masked youths threw stones at hundreds of cars at 
checkpoints to protest the cards 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip have been ordered to 
begin a boycott friday of their jobs in israel to protest the cards 
which israeli authorities say are aimed at increasing security 
in the occupied west bank on thursday soldiers shot and killed a 
palestinian prison escapee carrying an uzi submachine gun when he 
ignored a warning to halt the army said 
shahadi darwish 25 was killed night near the village of idna 
20 miles southwest of jerusalem 
the army said darwish escaped in may from a jail where he was 
detained on suspicion of committing several terrorist acts 
including the murder of a police officer 
his death raised to 537 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli troops and jewish settlers since the uprising began in 
december 1987 another 95 palestinians accused of collaborating with 
israel have been killed by fellow arabs and 38 israelis have been 
killed 
elsewhere in the west bank troops shot and wounded four 
palestinians including a 5yearold boy arab hospital officials 
said the army said it was investigating the incidents 
near erez crossing brig gen arye ramot head of the gaza strip 
military government said the new computerized id cards will prevent 
potential offenders from entering israel 
he said nearly 60000 new cards had been issued and 30000 to 
40000 more would probably be given out by the time the system 
becomes fully operational in three months a few thousand people 
have been refused cards because they have criminal records of been 
accused of security offenses ramot said 
ramot would not give details on why people were refused cards but 
said even some people arrested in the uprising could receive them if 
they stopped antiisraeli activities 
palestinians maintain the new system is mostly intended to quell 
the uprising by putting an economic squeeze on gaza where poverty 
is widespread and the population of 700000 depends heavily on jobs 
in israel 
graffiti in gaza called for a twoweek boycott of israeli jobs 
starting friday and a leaflet from the plobacked uprising leaders 
ordered a oneweek sympathy strike by workers in the west bank to 
start friday 
enforcers for the committees that run the revolt have been going 
through towns villages and camps to seize the cards 
near erez on thursday a 48yearold palestinian father of eight 
complained hed had to pay his back taxes to get a card and that now 
fellow arabs probably would seize the card 
nonpayment of taxes has been a major tactic of the uprising and 
palestinians who want cards must pay all back taxes 
ramot said about 1000 people had asked for second cards after 
their first ones were seized 
according to government figures 50000 palestinians from the 
gaza strip work in israel along with about 60000 residents of the 
west bank

the massachusetts port authority unreasonably and 
illegally imposed a dual set of landing fees to discourage small 
planes from using logan international airport a federal appeals 
court ruled thursday 
a threejudge panel of the 1st us circuit court of appeals 
wrote that massports its landing fee system had been 
unscientifically developed and unfairly discriminated against small 
planes 
massports policy was based on the premise that commercial jets 
carrying 400 passengers should have priority over a sixseat private 
plane but federal law has long held that all aircraft should have 
equal access to us runways 
the us department of transportation which objected to 
massports fees has broad authority and responsibility to 
regulate navigable airspace to assure its efficient use and to 
protect the right of freedom of transit through navigable 
airspace the court ruled 
massport officials said they were disapppointed with the decision 
but hope to work with new leadership at the transportation 
department in washington to ease delay and congestion at logan 
massport last year raised the landing fee for small aircraft at 
logan from a flat 25 per touchdown to a minimum of 100 at the 
same time commercial jet fees were cut a jumbo jet for example 
saw its 800 fee cut in half 
the owners of private and commuter planes complained but traffic 
dropped by onethird and ontime performance for commercial jets 
surged from last place among the countrys 27 largest airports in 
may 1988 to second place in december 1988

reigned for 19 years as the queen of dodge citys long branch saloon 
in the tv series gunsmoke died after a long battle with cancer 
she was 60 
miss blake died wednesday night at mercy general hospital said 
hospital spokeswoman jerri ewen 
she was a beautiful and gracious lady who had a lot to do with 
the success of gunsmoke series star james arness said thursday 
we were a family together there are a lot of people for whom 
gunsmoke had a special meaning and they will be sharing the 
memories today 
the actress had surgery for oral cancer in 1977 and later 
appeared throughout the country for two years on behalf of the 
american cancer society she was once a twopackaday smoker 
in 1984 the cancer society gave her its annual courage award 
which was presented in the oval office by president reagan 
miss blake left gunsmoke in 1974 after 19 years the show 
lasted one more season on cbs then was canceled 
set in the lawless cattle town of dodge city kan in the late 
1800s gunsmoke was one of televisions original adult 
westerns more violent saltier and sexier than the cowboy fare 
offered young viewers in the mid1950s 
the shows original cast starred arness as marshal matt dillon 
dennis weaver as his limping deputy chester goode milburn stone as 
doc adams and miss blake as kitty russell the throatyvoiced 
owner of the long branch 
i loved her very much weaver said she was very talented 
and a real joy for me to work with 
there was a love interest between the redhaired kitty russell 
character and arness marshal dillon but the writers kept it off 
screen 
we keep it very subtle she said in a 1962 interview we 
let people let their imagination do what they want them to do 
actually i love the scenes where all we do is as jim says 
eyeball it 
gunsmokes story lines softened when it was moved in 1961 from 
its late saturday night time slot to early monday or tuesday nights 
miss kitty was no longer a potential rape victim of leering bad 
guys instead she was abducted a lot 
good lord have i been kidnapped she said in 1968 im 
sick and tired of it the writers claim i cant be in jeopardy as 
long as im in town because matt would protect me so they keep 
having me kidnapped 
after gunsmoke she worked only sporadically usually in 
guest appearances for tv game shows movies of the week and such 
series as edge of night hart to hart and love boat 
miss blake born beverly louise neill in buffalo ny made her 
dramatic debut as a 10yearold in a school pageant she signed a 
contract with mgm while still in her teens and her first film role 
was in the 1950 film stars in my crown 
besides her work for the american cancer society miss blake was 
a longtime activist for animal protection

two inmates were convicted thursday of 
abducting a high school honor student who said he decided not to 
contact authorities or try to flee because it didnt seem like the 
right thing to do 
the sixmember marion circuit court jury deliberated about four 
hours before finding inmates patrick paige 21 and anthony cokley 
23 guilty of one count each of kidnapping and robbery 
circuit judge ray mcneal sentenced both men to 30 years in prison 
for the robbery and life imprisonment for the jan 3 kidnapping of 
17yearold ted siegel 
during the threeday trial the jury heard conflicting testimony 
on whether the youth willingly assisted in the flight 
paige and cokley went on an 11day crime spree up the east coast 
before they were captured in utah on jan 18 four days after siegel 
was released in baltimore 
on thursday paige said he talked siegel into driving the pair 
from the ocala area and the teen was never kidnapped but siegel 
said he was abducted outside his familys lowell horse farm after 
cokley choked him unconscious 
in more than five hours of testimony wednesday siegel said there 
were several times along the trip when he could have fled or called 
for help but he decided not to contact authorities because he did 
not feel threatened and he was worried about his mothers car 
it didnt seem like the right thing to do the ocala high 
school student told assistant public defender ed bonnett the youth 
also said he helped the inmates carry goods stolen in burglaries 
siegel called home on jan 4 from the outskirts of atlanta when 
paige suggested it siegel said 
paige claimed he and cokley snuck out of the marion correctional 
institution to visit inmates at a nearby womens facility they 
decided to flee the state after they could not get back inside the 
prison 
paige said they encountered siegel outside a convenience store 
near his home and convinced the youth they were fleeing drug dealers 
and needed a ride to safety 
after siegel drove the pair to gainesville paige said he 
admitted they were escaped prisoners 
i leveled with him because i felt i owed it to him to tell him 
because he gave us a ride paige testified at that point he 
said he was going to help us out 
in july paige and cokley were sentenced to 30 years each in 
prison after pleading guilty to escape charges

hundreds of lebanese fleeing wartorn 
beirut on thursday reached this checkpoint on the border of israels 
selfdesignated security zone in southern lebanon 
we all live in fear and shells keep falling around said 
21yearold lina baydoun it makes no difference whether we are 
shiites or christians we all suffer 
ms baydoun a physics student at beiruts american university 
is among more than 25000 refugees who have escaped to this area 
since artillery duels between syrian forces and gen michel aouns 
christian troops began in march 
by lebanese police count at least 776 people have died and 2076 
wounded in the confrontation 
foreign and israeli reporters on a tour of the bayt yahun 
checkpoint five miles north of israel saw at least 300 lebanese 
who arrived from beirut thursday 
most of them said they live in the security zone a 
sixto10mile wide belt along the border that israel carved out in 
1985 after withdrawing most of its troops from lebanon following a 
threeyear occupation 
others own a second house in the zone and still others said they 
would stay with relatives there until the latest round of fighting 
ends 
adnan bazzi a social worker said he and his relatives have 
recently made at least 10 trips to beirut and back checking if 
their beirut house was damaged in the shelling 
every day shells are falling on our houses he said i have 
never seen so much shelling and it continues into the night some 
shells even pierce the underground bomb shelters 
some of the refugees settle in abandoned houses in the area 
israeli army officers said 
the lebanese arrived carrying their luggage they were not 
allowed to bring in their vehicles for fear of suicide car bomb 
attacks like the aug 9 incident in which five israeli soldiers and 
an allied militiaman were wounded 
the extremist shiite moslem hezbollah group claimed 
responsibility in the bombing which it said was in retaliation for 
israels july 28 kidnapping of a shiite cleric from south lebanon 
reporters were ordered to wear bulletproof vests and helmets as 
their convoy accompanied by an israeli armoured personnel carrier 
and military jeeps crossed into southern lebanon 
defense minister yitzhak rabin speaking at an army base on the 
israeli side of the border told reporters that 90 percent of the 
refugees were shiites but said he believed they sought refuge 
i believe that they realize the stability the relative 
tranquility in the security zone he said and they prefer to 
find a refuge either in the security zone or in its vicinity in 
southern lebanon

although the soviet union seems sincere in 
seeking better relations with the united states the superpowers 
must survive an uneasy transition before the cold war truly 
thaws the nations top military adviser said thursday 
i am persuaded that we are entering a period of uneasy 
transition which will hopefully lead to a new era in the superpower 
relationship said adm william j crowe jr chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff 
but there are many uncertainties still on the horizon and my 
assessment is that we may be in this unsettled state for a long 
time even though that is not comforting he said 
crowe is retiring sept 30 after 42 years in the navy including 
four as chief military adviser to the president the secretary of 
defense and the national security council 
he said the us government and people must keep cool in the 
face of numerous troop and arms reduction proposals from moscow 
my deepest concern is that our own impatience american 
impatience might tempt us to move prematurely with broad leaps 
of hope and faith when we encounter inevitable frustration with the 
pace of bilateral developments crowe said we just must be 
patient my own reading of americans is that they dont like to wait 
they want a better world and they want it tomorrow 
crowe who in june became the first joint chiefs of staff 
chairman to review soviet domestic military forces said he is 
convinced soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is trying to 
liberalize his country but may have underestimated the time and 
effort perestroika and glasnost require 
crowe said problems that plague the russian economic political 
and social scenes extend to its military and the peoples 
expectations of gorbachev make solutions even more critical 
they realize that they must improve the quality of consumer 
goods and services available to the soviet people as a whole 
crowe said in turn those aims suggest they must somehow reduce 
the enormus military burdens on their economy 
although some cuts have been made in the soviet military 
gorbachev believes defense must be the top priority crowe said 
even with further reducation the soviets would still have more than 
four million troops and hold the largest inventory of military 
hardware 
moreover other elements of soviet power remain untouched by 
reductions announced thus far including military activities in 
space strategic forces mainly nuclear and defensive forces air 
defense units naval combatants and strategic mobility assets 
crowe said 
after the speech crowe urged military restraint against 
terrorists saying the military is built for one thing and were 
trying to apply it to another 
answering questions from members of the japanamerica society of 
honolulu which sponsored the speech crowe said we could level 
beirut but that would not solve the problem 
terrorists holding 16 hostages including eight americans in 
beirut do not make good military targets because they are very 
mobile and easily replaced by their sponsors especially iran syria 
and libya crowe said 
besides crowe said americans were not ready to deal with the 
repercussions a military strike would bring 
americans dont want to go to war over terrorism he said 
what they really want is these problems to go away in a week 
without a lot of energy and investment

congress approved a bill thursday 
to speed the sale of dozens of state companies giving president 
carlos menem his first legislative victory 
losses by state companies have produced huge deficits and pushed 
inflation 
the legislation which takes effect immediately and lasts for 180 
days transfers from congress to menem the authority to sell state 
companies the legislation drafted by menems cabinet can be 
renewed once for an additional 180 days 
a very important step has been taken toward reestablishing the 
republic on a basis that will allow economic growth interior 
minister eduardo bauza said 
two television stations in the capital will be sold within two 
months according to a presidential decree next in line are the 
state telephone company and airline aerolineas argentinas 
government officials said 
menem was elected on may 14 amid economic crisis after taking 
office in july menem said state companies should be sold to cut the 
drag on the economy and promote foreign investment and growth 
the cost of living soared 1966 percent last month at least 14 
percent of argentines are unemployed or underemployed and wages 
fell by 60 percent during the first six months of this year 
operating losses this year at the several hundred state companies 
are projected at 55 billion or about 7 percent of the gross 
domestic product the public works ministry said in july 
the state oil company alone is expected to lose 1 billion this 
year and the state railway 500 million 
the state reform law passed thursday authorizes the sale partial 
sale or comanagement with private investors of port facilities 
grain elevators buenos aires subway the national ship line 
petrochemical plants and oil fields 
a companion bill would suspend state subsidies to private 
businesses remove barriers to foreign investment enforce tax 
collection and halt central bank bailouts of provincial banks and 
state companies 
congress was expected to approve that bill next week 
the decision to sell state companies was a policy reversal for 
menem whose peronist party last year blocked attempts by former 
president raul alfonsin to implement the same legislation 
unions traditionally the mainstay of the peronists fear job and 
wage cutbacks but confronted with economic crisis they have gone 
along with menem on the issue 
so far menems economic policy has been almost universally well 
received 
in six weeks he negotiated voluntary wage and price guidelines 
cut the fiscal deficit by increasing statecontroled rates for 
public utilities by 600 percent and more and devalued the austral 
currency by 54 percent 
inflation for august is expected to be less than onehalf julys 
rate according to private as well as government economists it is 
thought the september rate will fall below 10 percent 
also thursday the car of labor leader saul ubaldini was 
destroyed by a bomb blast there were no injuries in the explosion 
directed at the secretarygeneral of the 3millionstrong general 
labor confederation 
no group claimed responsibilty for the explosion police said 
they were investigating

a convicted drug smuggler testified thursday 
that colombian cocaine traffickers control police and key officials 
in a number of countries and once were offered a chance to buy all 
the cocaine confiscated in the bahamas 
we were setting it up but i was arrested max mermelstein 
testified from behind a screen while six federal bodyguards stood by 
in an electronically disguised voice mermelstein said he had 
smuggled up to 55 tons of cocaine into the united states as an 
employee of the boys from colombia before his arrest in 1985 
his testimony came at a hearing of the senate judiciary committee 
that its chairman sen joseph biden ddel said was designed to 
provide background for the comprehensive drugfighting blueprint due 
from the bush administration next month 
mermelstein told the committee the united states has been 
hampered in its effort to fight drug cartels in part because we 
deal directly with the police and local governments and in south 
america thats a direct line to the cartel 
police and public officials except for highranking army officers 
are brought under control by the cocaine cartel through bribe money 
and the threat of murder mermelstein said 
they own them mermelstein said either they take the 
money or they die 
he said such corruption is widespread and in the bahamas it 
goes all the way to the top 
he testified that he was once offered a deal by a bahamian 
official of so much per kilo for any cocaine confiscated by the 
bahamian government for distribution in the united states the 
committee did not ask the officials name 
he portrayed cartel leaders as using billions of dollars from 
cocaine sales in the united states to pursue a globehopping 
lifestyle including frequent visits to the bullfights in mexico and 
spain fabio ochoa considers himself an afficienado and a 
firstclass bullfighter he said 
he said members of the ochoa family top leaders of one cartel 
were on hand for the last summers olympics in south korea he said 
another cartel kingpin pablo escobar has easily slipped in and out 
of the united states using fake documents 
a former assistant us attorney in miami richard gregorie told 
the committee the customs service and the marshals service developed 
a plan to arrest jorge ochoa last fall during a trip to caracas 
venezuela and fly him to the united states for trial but the plan 
was dropped because of state department opposition 
ochoa has been indicted by us grand juries several times but 
the colombian supreme court abrogated that countrys extradition 
treaty with the united states two years ago and cannot be arrested 
by his countrys authorities on a us warrant 
mermelstein told the panel how he witnessed a murder in the early 
1970s and was allowed to live on condition that he would work 
for the cartel and subsequently imported up to 56 tons of cocaine 
into the united states he was arrested in 1985 served two years in 
prison and is now in the governments witness protection program 
he said cartel leaders have put a sevenfigure price on his head 
in other testimony robert w merkle a former us attorney in 
tampa told the committee that colombia has a government that is 
in many respects a hostage of the criminal element in its midst 
this is not surprising given the fact that the narcoterrorists 
are responsible for the assassination of scores of judges 
journalists police officers and innocent civilians in a campaign of 
total intimidation he said he said the peruvian government has 
been hobbled by leftist rebels who obtained an estimated 500 
million last year through drug trafficking 
he also said panamanian dictator manuel noriega maintains his 
power and his control through alliance with narcotics

colombias judges went on strike and 
threatened to resign thursday to protest security conditions after 
the slaying of a court magistrate who had ruled against two leaders 
of the medellin cocaine cartel 
union leaders met in emergency session thursday in response to a 
wave of shooting deaths and intimidation of magistrates said helmut 
romero the unions vice president 
in view of the governments inability to protect its judges we 
decided to begin a nationwide indefinite strike and intend to offer 
our collective resignation romero said 
he did not say when that would happen 
police announced late thursday that 51 people were arrested and 
77 million in cash and gold bars were seized in a nationwide 
sweep police spokesman alfredo salgado also said about 50 
submachine guns revolvers pistols and hand grenades were also 
seized since wednesday 
late wednesday gunmen on two motorcycles and in a taxi opened 
fire with with machine guns on magistrate carlos valencia garcia 
43 as he left his office in central bogota 
valencia garcia who had rejected court motions to exonerate two 
leaders of the medellin cartel for their part in the 1987 slaying of 
a journalist was shot six times he died a short time later at a 
hospital 
every judge who have investigated cartel leaders pablo escobar 
gaviria and gonzalo rodriguez gacha are either dead have resigned 
or were forced to leave colombia by death threats 
romero called on the government to step up protection of federal 
judges involved in drug trials because it is not acceptable that a 
judge is slain in colombia every 15 days 
gen miguel maza marquez the head of colombias secret police 
late wednesday said police would adopt new security measures to 
protect judges but refused to say what they were maza marquez last 
month escaped an assassination attempt that he attributed to the 
cocaine cartel 
the assassination of valenca garcia should unite us to look for 
ways to combat our common enemy drug trafficking maza marquez 
said following an urgent meeting of the national security council 
maza marquez said valencia garcia was accompanied by two armed 
security guards and was wearing a bulletproof vest when he was shot 
and killed 
antonio salom beltran president of colombias supreme court 
said the war against judges had reached an intolerable point 
in the last 10 years 23 judges have been assassinated and 
officials blame nearly all the deaths on drug traffickers 
three years ago 12 members of colombias supreme court were 
killed when guerrillas took over the palace of justice in bogota 
the government said rebels were working with drug smugglers and 
destroyed hundreds of files on drug trafficking 
the medellin cartel named after the colombian city where it is 
based is the worlds largest cocaine ring it is believed 
responsible for up to 80 percent of the cocaine that is smuggled 
into the united states

babies may learn to crawl and walk a little slower 
if their mothers drink while nursing according to a study released 
today that suggests even small amounts of alcohol in breast milk can 
affect development 
while the results are troubling experts caution that there is no 
clear proof that nursing mothers will harm their babies if they 
drink moderately 
i would not worry about drinking during lactation until this 
finding has been confirmed in at least one more study said dr 
ruth e little principal author of the research report 
even if their babies are slow to walk she said mothers should 
not blame their occasional drinking because babies normally vary in 
when they learn these skills

ben vereen hit bottom in december 1987 when a 
car crash killed his 16yearold daughter naja he mixed drugs and 
alcohol not caring if i woke up or not another daughter 
brought him back from the edge 
naja wouldnt want you to do this to yourself 18yearold 
malaika told him 
that got through like a blade zap recalled vereen 42 i 
realized i was still here and i had children and they needed me and 
how selfish and arrogant of me to try to end my life so i chose 
life 
but choosing life quitting drugs was just the beginning of an 
odyssey that took the entertainer back to his brooklyn neighborhood 
and a chance encounter with his homeless addicted sister lucinda 
vereen batts 
lucinda was on the doorstep pregnant and addicted to crack when 
vereen returned a year ago to the house his mother left him when she 
died in 1984 
i thought at first she was angry at me for the years that wed 
been apart and i looked closer and realized that she was shaking 
he said i said come honey its time to come home 
it was like a message like the lord was just bringing all of 
us together then i said thats it were going to duke now i 
rolled up my sleeves and got in the fight 
now lucinda too is recovering and vereen has pledged help win 
back his childhood streets in bedfordstuyvesant from drug dealers 
who had moved into the house that went unattended after his mother 
died 
the plan drew opposition from neighbors who didnt want 
recovering addicts on their street but vereen wasnt deterred he 
is determined to tear down the house and rebuild it for a drug 
program although he is uncertain of specifics like how many people 
it could help or what services would be provided 
on a recent visit he noted that herkimer street had changed much 
in a few decades drug dealers had stripped the threestory home of 
windows aluminum siding even its street numbers pigeons flew in 
and out 
i am stunned said vereen who had lived there from ages 11 
to 18 with his two sisters long before dreams of stardom became 
reality a tony award for his role in pippin acclaim for the 
tv miniseries roots and standingroomonly performances in las 
vegas 
he stood silently and stared for a long moment this is the 
before you can get the after pictures in a year or two he said 
finally 
this hasnt discouraged me at all as a matter of fact it has 
encouraged me when you see that people have to steal the aluminum 
off of a building to get drugs youve got to really get angry and 
get involved 
within 100 feet was an open lot with abandoned trucks cars and 
garbage just as someone might point out daffodils or weeds in a 
lawn lucinda described the lot where she had spent the most tragic 
moments of her last four years 
thats part of the lot where wed stay when i was getting high 
thats where i found my friend dead he got crushed stealing parts 
from under a car i happened to go through there and found his body 
up under the car under the rim where the tires had set on his chest 
all of us crack users used to come here in this lot wed sleep 
in these she said pointing to abandoned vehicles they had a 
lot of homeless out here in the lot some still stay out here still 
sleep out here in the trucks 
vereen said he feels blessed that work kept me camouflaged 
and off the streets during his addiction he began experimenting in 
the 1960s when it was cool to do drugs or smoke marijuana take 
acid or things like that 
if youre going to run with the crowd then youre going to do 
what the crowd does he said then all of a sudden it becomes 
more than cool it becomes dangerous it got dangerous for me in 
june of 87 after i lost my daughter in december i lost it 
completely and i got really bad 
i was so depressed i kept crying and i got real funky i 
remember doing a film in italy and id get up and put on my clothes 
and they would stink i was sitting on the set and smelling this 
odor and id go man thats not like me and i looked in the 
mirror and i couldnt recognize myself 
he often thought about killing himself and began mixing drugs and 
alcohol why i didnt oust out of here the lord only knows 
now vereen and his sister look ahead 
lucinda stays at the vereen home in englewood nj along with 
vereens wife nancy and their two daughters kabara 14 and 
karon 13 their other children are malaika and benji 23 
vereen now a national spokesman for the campaign for a drug 
free america hopes to donate his childhood home to that cause 
youve got to dream big i will get it done some way somehow 
ive started this fight and im not going to walk away from

the tnt movie breaking point is a remake 
of the 1964 film 36 hours starring james garner and eva marie 
saint 
the question is why 
granted the premise of the world war ii thriller is intriguing 
the nazis capture a us intelligence officer and try to trick him 
into thinking hes in a hospital suffering amnesia and the war is 
over so hell reveal when and where the allied invasion of europe 
is to take place 
but it is certainly dated and no matter how interesting the 
premise the story doesnt work if the viewers dont care what 
happens to the characters as weakly written as they are they 
arent helped by a cast list that is an eery vision of 
weeknightonthedinnertheatercircuit 
breaking point premieres tonight and is repeated saturday and 
sunday 
corbin bernsen who does an admirable job of playing a crass 
shallow divorce lawyer on la law would have been more 
convincing as one of the nazis his maj jefferson pike comes off as 
a vacuous dilettante who looks like hed be much more comfortable 
shopping for sweaters at saks than plotting some nasty old invasion 
of normandy 
the grinding wheels of the plot are set in motion when pike goes 
to an unexplained meeting with a unsavory character at a lisbon bar 
drinks spiked espresso and is plucked off the sidewalk by the nazis 
allowing director peter markle to ignore the plodding script for a 
while and engage in some arty slomo and blackandwhite photography 
after a wee bit of electroshock torture which causes pike to 
grimace and perspire he wakes up in a pleasant rest home surrounded 
by seeming yanks the date on the newspaper is convincing enough 
but pike is suspicious when everyone is vague on the identity of the 
mayor of chicago and who won the world series 
joanna pacula who is making a career of tv world war ii dramas 
crossings escape from sobibor plays anna the german 
nurse enlisted to entice pike into spilling the beans because she 
looks exactly like the wife the nazis have told him is dead no 
wonder she and his wife look alike she plays both of them if not 
for this amazing circumstance the rest of the story would have been 
tragically lost to posterity 
pike aided by the miracle of flashbacks figures out the nazi 
game he confirms his suspicions by tripping anna up with a bit of 
clever dialogue something about a paper cut received recently in 
london aha were supposed to be in occupied germany understand 
this not exactly a battle of wits between two mental giants 
only the stalwart john glover david inspires any interest 
playing gerber the nazi doctor who hatches the brainwashing plot 
as a potential footnote for the annals of bizarre casting the 
preppylooking david marshall grant thirtysomething plays a 
nazi commandant his presence must satisfy some behindthescenes 
debt we arent aware of his only plot purpose seems to be to menace 
the proceedings by expressing whining doubts about the validity of 
dr gerbers experiment not exactly the stuff of razoredged 
suspense 
unlike the 1964 film breaking point ends with a cynical 
twist which might have played on a work of contemporary fiction 
but isnt particularly compelling as part of a historical drama 
most viewers do know we won the war dont they 
despite some wonderfully inane dialogue eg dr gerber you 
wont have to sleep with major pike again nurse anna with 
straight face thank you sir the breaking point for most 
viewers will come about 10 minutes into the film

the uscanada border on lake champlain ap the water in lake 
champlain knowing no national boundaries flows freely between 
canada and the united states so do hundreds of boaters to the 
chagrin of customs agents 
a border is a border whether it is the land the air or the 
lake said jean paul barriere who runs the canadian port of entry 
without a summer cruising permit those leaving the cottagelined 
beaches on missisquoi bay in venice en quebec are supposed to stop 
at the us customs service house in alburg springs which is all 
but impossible to reach by water 
it was slightly easier to get to canadian customs boaters could 
stop at a dock just over the border and call officials in nearby 
phillipsburg 
until this year boaters going in and out of the bay jutting into 
quebec from vermont missed or ignored the notch in the trees that 
marks the line last year all but five were forgetting about 
reporting said barriere laughing 
to encourage respect for the border canada set up a floating 
immigration station a 20by40foot blue and orange barge officials 
say is a first 
on a sunny day in the middle of the week canadian customs 
officer jean pierre fortin logged 11 boats crossing by early 
afternoon he has counted more than 1000 since he took up his post 
in a boat near the barge june 21 
fortin isnt necessarily looking for drug runners or illegal 
aliens though hes prepared for both he also keeps watch for 
people trying to escape paying canadian taxes on boats by buying 
them in the united states and taking them through the bay instead of 
hauling them by land through customs stations 
his main reason for floating in the bay is to make an afternoon 
outing more pleasant by giving cruisers an easy way to report to 
customs canadian officers are on the barge between 11 am and 7 
pm until midseptember 
but for those who want to escape the bay for the open lake on the 
vermont side getting to us customs remains a trial and sometimes 
a game of chicken 
two power boats with canadians aboard stop at fortins post 
though technically they need only report at the us station one 
couple already has a summer permit to take their boat as far south 
as st albans bay without a stop on each trip but their son and a 
friend in the second boat dont 
are the police down there the father asks fortin doesnt 
tell 
the us customs house is within sight but the shallow water and 
rocky beach pose a greater risk than the agents both boats whizz 
past 
fortin shrugs he knows the boaters and he isnt surprised they 
took a chance for an afternoons spin on the lake 
but taking the chance and perhaps being confronted by imposing 
agents in uniform is just the situation thomas ducharme owner of 
the growing champlain marina and a boat dealership wants his 
customers to avoid us officials are hard on canadians he says 
and difficulty reporting has cost him customers 
when ducharme opened his marina three years ago he renewed a 
local push for a dock at the us house but the bay was too shallow 
and the idea grew for the floating station and fortins boat which 
is docked at ducharmes marina 
i did it for my pocket i want my customers to cross the border 
without any trouble ducharme said adding that to go by the book 
he must take his customers overland to the us station before 
sending them off for the day 
tim moran assistant district director of the us customs 
service in st albans acknowleges that the honest traveler would 
be less apprehensive about crossing the border if they had a place 
to check in 
an invitation to share the barge came too late for this year but 
us officials want to see how it works the crossings logged by the 
canadians are more than moran had expected but numbers alone wont 
justify a us presence 
it would be a balancing between the numbers and the perceived 
threat he said adding that there is some smuggling activity on 
the lake 
earlier this month the us coast guard and customs officials 
tied up at the barge to search boats under the bush administrations 
zero tolerance drug policy the sixhour duty brought the first 
arrest of the season a quebec man on whose boat inspectors 
allegedly found eight grams of marijuana 
fortin taps a pen on his log eleven boats have passed and hell 
radio alburg springs with an update its a big favor were doing 
them he said 
it is a big favor agreed noel induni of the us 
immigration and naturalization service in st albans the minute 
you put someone there it doesnt matter if it is a canadian 
officer you get compliance

in the arcane world of food additive 
regulation tolerance is a finely used term but it boils down to 
what parents of 2yearolds learn quickly its how much you let em 
get away with 
for example some chemicals are banned entirely by federal 
regulations from the nations food supply because they have been 
shown to cause cancer genetic deformities or other health problems 
other chemicals synthetic or natural are prohibited if their 
residues in food exceed certain tolerance levels these 
tolerances depend on the chemicals involved and how they measure up 
to federal criteria 
chemical residues in food cover a wide range of items including 
fruits vegetables meat milk poultry and eggs and they also 
involve residues from manmade chemicals such as ddt banned years 
ago and naturally occurring substances such aflatoxin 
one of the major sources of food contamination is the array of 
pesticides used on crops to control insect pests plant diseases and 
weeds its a problem for both domestic producers and foreign 
growers who ship produce to the us market 
two agriculture department economists catherine greene and glenn 
zepp say that american consumers are eating more fruits and 
vegetables and are getting more persnickety about the health 
effects of chemical residues on produce 
greene and zepp writing in the national food review a quarterly 
usda magazine noted 1988 industry figures showing that nearly 18 
percent of consumers polled said they were concerned enough by the 
possible effects of residues to change their buying habits 
the survey conducted by the packer a produce industry magazine 
showed that another 64 percent were concerned but had not altered 
their buying habits only about 19 percent said they were not very 
worried 
according to greene and zepp consumers may be wary of the 
effectiveness of current food safety regulations 
for example they said in their report when small groups of 
redbook magazine readers were asked about food safety only 7 
percent of those who replied said they trusted current laws to 
guarantee a safe food supply seventy percent said they did not 
few consumers appreciate the scope of the us food regulatory 
system the inspection and testing procedures for monitoring food 
production processing and marketing which has generally given 
americans a safe food supply the report said also new steps 
are being taken to improve monitoring a fill the gaps in pesticide 
regulation 
although more than a dozen federal agencies have a hand in the 
regulation of produce quality safety appearance freshness 
labeling marketing and imports only two are involved in pesticide 
enforcement 
the environmental protection agency determines which pesticides 
may be registered for use on food crops the epa also sets 
tolerances for those chemicals in fruits vegetables and other foods 
for human consumption 
food and drug administration officials monitor and enforce the 
pesticide tolerances set by epa on both domestic and imported 
products 
the agriculture department has charge of the inspection of meat 
and poultry and processed food items containing those products 
greene and zepp noted that congress last year amended the federal 
insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act which requires that 
pesticides be registered with epa for legal use on food crops 
the amendments include a 1997 deadline for testing 
reregistration and possible cancellation of older chemicals and a 
faster track for registering new chemicals 
one of the basic problems in the governments registration 
process for pesticides used on food crops has been the rapid growth 
in the consumption of some fruits and vegetables 
in other words chemical tolerance set years ago were based 
partly on lower consumption rates of certain food items that raises 
the possibility that residue intake by consumers is understated 
for example the report said average consumption of fresh 
honeydew broccoli and tomatoes increased from 11 11 and 126 
pounds per person respectively in 1976 to 24 33 and 168 pounds 
in 1987 
some of the pesticides used on these vegetables were registered 
prior to these consumption gains 
the report added that certain age groups eat larger amounts of 
some fruits and vegetables than the average on which the residue 
intake is estimated which also could cause residue intake being 
understated 
another flaw is that epas tolerancesetting system does not 
consider the health effects of consuming several pesticides 
simultaneously which may or may not be greather than the sum of the 
risks from exposure to the residues individually the report said 
legislative pressure continues to build on capitol hill to ban 
unsafe pesticides and strengthen epas tolerance procedures 
among the measures are food safety amendments introduced by sen 
edward kennedy dmass and rep henry waxman dcalif which 
would require epa to establish residue tolerances for different 
population groups such as infants and children

the young man stood staring straight ahead 
police followed me he hissed through nearly closed lips 
another meeting gone awry 
hours later at a new place he explained 
police came to my house and arrested me they held me 10 days 
im still under investigation im afraid my work unit may fire me 
because of it i want to leave the country 
there was quiet defiance in his manner defiance of the official 
line as expressed in the peoples daily that chinas young people 
should uphold the communist party leadership wholeheartedly serve 
the people and struggle hard and that they should renounce 
bourgeoisliberal meaning western culture 
on another night more than 100 people mostly in their 20s 
gathered at a private bar for an earthumping rock n roll party 
so much for renouncing bourgeoisliberal culture 
although swept off tiananmen square by the army the night of june 
34 the student democracy movement now is an undercurrent roiling 
out of sight of officialdom 
two months into the communist partys biggest purge in more than 
a decade a final effort by chinas aging revolutionaries to 
preserve their marxistmaoist dream the younger generation has 
tuned the government out quietly ignoring a reeducation program 
launched after tiananmen 
many chinese foreigners get to talk to including some over 30 
say they did not bother to watch the latest government television 
documentary on the sevenweek student movement that the government 
denounces as counterrevolutionary 
discreetly many seek out foreigners in beijing for information 
or just to talk 
a shopkeeper tossing a basin of water out his door and seeing a 
foreigner beckoned please come in and have some tea 
a park worker walking home after an ideological study session 
that claimed the west was trying to colonize china sat on a bench 
next to a foreigner and struck up a conversation 
a young woman selling clothing eagerly pulled a foreigner into 
her tiny stall 
like the others she brought up june 34 
the government says no one died in tiananmen square but we 
hear on the voice of america that many people died we dont believe 
our own government 
can you tell me what is true 
the news that went out around the world from beijing that night 
and the days following was that the government sent an estimated 
150000 soldiers into beijing to crush the students democracy 
movement hundreds possibly thousands of people were killed in two 
days of street fighting between soldiers with tanks and guns and 
civilians with stones and molotov cocktails 
the chinese have other questions when they meet up with 
foreigners is it true student leader wang dan has been arrested 
he was arrested july 2 but the government did not announce it until 
aug 17 how many student leaders escaped fewer than a dozen 
will president bush impose more sanctions on china he says no 
they also turn to foreigners to pour out bitterness they dare not 
express to a fellow chinese 
a taxi driver china is still ruled by emperors told to an 
unsympathetic ear that remark could mean police interrogation and a 
black mark in his file 
in the aftermath of tiananmen the government arrested thousands 
of people executed at least 12 and sentenced others to life in 
prison it has terrorized the intellectual community by purging the 
most openminded and most creative government advisers writers and 
academics 
li lu a 23yearold student leader who has fled china told 
reporters aug 17 in geneva where he had addressed a un human 
rights panel that 120000 people had been arrested since june and 
that some of them had been secretly executed most of the chinese 
people continue to support the students li said they give me 
every kind of information for security reasons i cannot name the 
sources but the information is reliable 
the government has installed cameras along streets throughout 
beijing their long necks occasionally swiveling from side to side 
three cameras watch the friendship store which the government runs 
for foreigners 
it has hung banners praising the great and glorious communist 
party from hotels and government buildings and filled the newspapers 
with editorials and columns maintaining that the democracy movement 
was a westernaided plot to turn china into a vassal state 
it has televised book burnings with officials setting fire to 
hundreds of books said to be reactionary or obscene 
but the government has failed to get all the people to listen to 
believe or to participate 
the partys antibourgeois liberalism campaign is being ignored 
like a television show with the sound turned off 
ten years of contact with the outside world encouraged by senior 
leader deng xiaopings policy of promoting rapid development have 
changed china to the point where old totalitarian methods no longer 
work to the fullest as they did in the past 
deng was respected as a reformer when he began his rule in 1978 
but now as millions of people nationwide are required to study his 
words and movies and books about him proliferate his prestige 
could hardly be lower 
we just string together words from dengs speech a chinese 
reporter said of his offices mandatory twiceweekly sessions to 
study deng each person must make a statement he said but its 
not necessary to be enthusiastic 
small numbers of chinese in beijing meet in secret to discuss 
goals of democratic change but say they have no plans for immediate 
action 
in most cases derision or anonymous defiance are the weapons now 
all of these things will be answered for reads a piece of 
graffito spraypainted in english on a subway station police 
apparently uncomprehending have not washed it off 
at viewings of a new movie lionizing deng as a young red army 
guerrilla leader audiences laugh when the young deng declares 
what i say goes 
even back then he had to have his way said woman who saw the 
movie 
after the top leaders pledged to wipe out corruption it turned 
out that the sons and daughters of some of them were involved a 
ditty began making the rounds about them the junior official will 
wear handcuffs the middlelevel official will make a selfcriticism 
and the top guy will make a report 
even university students who are now being watched more closely 
and given more intensive political education than any other group 
have dared to show their anger over being punished for protesting 
one night in late july several hundred graduates at beijing 
university a center of dissidence in the spring gathered on campus 
and began beating pots and pans shouting sarcastically long live 
the communist party 
the government caught the sarcasm and withheld the diploma of the 
alleged ringleader 
more than anything ordinary chinese look to foreign investment 
and foreign ideas to open up their oneparty system to allow freedom 
of speech and the press 
you are our hope a student told a foreigner 
said the park worker to the foreigner on the park bench we 
need foreign governments to help us make revolution

the chinese leaderships crackdown on dissent 
since early june would not be so startling if it did not follow one 
of communist chinas most lively periods of debate in the arts and 
social sciences 
early this year for example the prestigious china art gallery 
in beijing allowed controversial exhibits of nude paintings and of 
avantgarde art at which a young artist shot her own work with a bb 
gun to show her rejection of chinese culture 
young economists developed schemes for distributing stateowned 
factories to the workers in hopes of stimulating productivity and 
cutting workers dependence on the state 
government television aired a documentary that challenged 
cherished notions of the superiority of traditional chinese 
civilization and denounced the great wall as a symbol of all that is 
insular and backward in china 
such new ideas were silenced by the gunfire in tiananmen square 
in june 
since then party officials have demanded that the entire nation 
unify thinking by studying the speeches of top leaders in 
defense of the crackdown 
here are some examples of unorthodox thinking that preceded the 
crackdown and what is being said now 
a banner carried by reporters from the communist party 
newspaper the peoples daily on may 4 we want to speak the 
truth a peoples daily article july 30 about certain erroneous 
views in chinese journalism different classes and different 
social groups have different standards of socalled truth 
objectivity and fairness the main role of the media is to be a 
party mouthpiece

chinas art and literature should embrace various concepts and 
forms from now on the party will get involved as little as 
possible in art creation performances and controversies wang 
meeting with artists and writers july 7 we should earnestly fight 
against bourgeois liberalism in literary and art circles and make 
socialist literature and art dominate 
social scientist wu jiaxiang writing in december in the 
nowclosed world economic herald of shanghai the insecurities and 
fear small private business people have that the government policies 
may change some day should be allayed with theoretical guarantees as 
well as specific measures the china daily newspaper july 30 
private business people whose wealth is displayed by their

only a small number of the foreigners who fled 
china after the army crushed the democracy movement in june have 
come back 
it is possible now to walk through the temple of heaven park one 
of beijings leading tourist attractions without seeing a single 
foreigner 
the friendship store a threestory government department store 
stocked with souvenirs and imported food for foreigners is packed 
with chinese these days 
the store is so desperate for shoppers it has raised its daily 
quota of chinese visitors it has slashed prices too a can of 
oolong tea sells for 12 yuan 325 now half the prejune price 
the two blocks between the jianguo and jinglun hotels for 
foreigners and the friendship store used to be crowded with young 
men offering to exchange money at black market rates now the money 
changers are gone 
some legitimate businessmen want to give up 
im trying to unload my business but no one wants to buy 
said a clothing vendor in a private market formerly jammed with 
foreign tourists 
many hotel workers and others affected by the drop in tourism are 
suddenly taking vacations at reduced salaries chinese workers 
do not ordinarily get vacations 
foreign residents in beijing are trickling back the us 
government gave approval aug 11 for embassy dependents to return 
and other countries are doing the same 
the government said twothirds of the nearly 1170 foreign 
companies with offices in beijing have not resumed normal 
operations many businessmen commute in from hong kong only to 
handle pressing matters 
but a western business consultant in beijing said companies that 
already have invested in china cannot afford to walk away and 
although new investment likely will suffer some companies still 
regard a presence in china as essential to their asian marketing 
strategies others have found they can get better terms now from 
chinese partners keen for investment dollars 
you would like to punish the government but how can you 
said the consultant speaking on condition of anonymity the moral 
issue always comes up but at the end of the day its just 
business 
it is less clear how cultural exchanges will fare the american 
joffrey ballet canceled what was to have been a blacktie 
performance this fall the british council postponed indefinitely a 
exhibition of modern british art 
some scholars have dropped plans to teach in china in the fall 
and others are still trying to decide the chinese government has 
suspended the us governmentsponsored exchange of fulbright 
scholars 
ignatius cao a chineseborn political science professor at the 
state university of new york in oneonta said halting scholarly 
exchanges would be tragic 
at least many chinese can know the other world through our 
presence he said i dont urge the students to make 
revolution i just want them to understand the realities outside 
the socialist camp

mazdas new mx5 miata the zippy little twoseater 
from japan is turning heads and commanding premium prices in an 
otherwise slow us car market giving the big three automakers 
another source of frustration 
waiting lists are long for the miata customers willingly pay 
thousands of dollars over the 13800 base price and there are 
reports that some owners have resold the cars at more than double 
the price they paid 
its an obsession reminiscent of the ford mustang craze a quarter 
century ago and how long it will last is uncertain 
but the enormous success of the miata a throwback to the sporty 
classic european roadsters of years past seems to attest to the 
shrewd marketing and design talent employed by japanese automakers 
who in the past have successfully exploited other niches even in 
detroits own backyard the cars creators were americans 
its one of the most exciting things ive witnessed said 
george mccabe deputy general manager of mazda motor of america 
inc the us marketing arm of mazda motor corp based in 
hiroshima japan 
mccabe said the company doesnt have a count on dealer orders for 
the 20000 miatas to be imported this year and its too early to 
decide whether production should be boosted beyond the 40000 
planned for 1990 
when compared with overall auto sales in the united states of 
course 40000 is small general motors corp for example sold 
more than 140000 cars in early august alone 
still gm and its chief us rivals ford motor co and chrysler 
corp have been forced to offer discounts and rebates on cars in an 
attempt to clear bloated inventories this summer and even that 
hasnt been too successful so the miatas popularity is at least a 
symbolic slap in their faces 
the tiny car has virtually no trunk space and room behind the two 
seats is minimal designers werent thinking of longdistance road 
trips when they were putting the car together 
their mission was to develop a basic sports car that would be fun 
to drive at a price that undercut sporty cars with more power and 
electronic gadgets 
the whole idea from the beginning was to make it an affordable 
sports car there was just a big gap for an affordable elemental 
sports car said norm garrett a layout engineer for the miata 
project who now works for volvogm heavy truck corp in greensboro 
nc 
officially miatas went on sale july 1 available in red white 
and blue dealers have been taking orders from consumers basing 
their decisions on automotive magazine writers who gushed over the 
car as far back as march 
all the publicity excitement and limited availability have 
created a temptation for dealers some of whom are said to be 
getting up to 5000 over list price from miatahungry buyers 
mccabe said mazda has sought to quell the temptation to gouge 
though the company cannot dictate to dealers how much to charge 
weve taken as strong a position as we can with our dealers 
weve notified them in writing about why its bad for them why its 
bad for mazda and why its shortsighted for them once this media 
attention dies down mccabe said 
consumers have a long memory he said if they feel theyre 
being taken advantage of in the future i think they will remember 
that dealer took advantage of that situation and go to another 
dealer 
john zabawa owner of eastland imports in detroit said consumers 
are lining up to buy miatas zabawa said hes not gouging even 
though demand exceeds supply 
there probably have been some people who have offered us more 
but we take them in order he said 
one of his customers kristen smith of detroit got hers on july 
24 and paid 18800 including the optional hard top she said she 
bought the miata because of its distinctive looks 
however she added the attention you get with it is not always 
good i had someone follow me home follow me for a long time for 
an hour 
scott petterson of northville mich a parking lot attendant at 
a swank restaurant in detroit said hes driven four or five miatas 
we get ferraris everything out here and this is the only one 
that everybody stares at he said

in the old gag the comedian answers the 
telephone and listens for a moment you dont say he marvels 
then ever more incredulous you dont say you dont say 
he hangs up who was it asks the straight man 
he didnt say 
not saying is no joke with president bush his adroit use of 
ambiguity is becoming a trademark its a way to avoid answering 
questions he doesnt want to answer or cant answer and a way to 
send signals political and diplomatic 
at his last day before vacation news conference his 20th by 
white house count bush used the technique to respond without really 
answering questions about us hostages in lebanon and possible 
steps to gain their freedom 
that is ambiguity with a purpose combining an invitation to iran 
to help get the hostages out and so foster better relations with a 
hint of possible reprisals when and if the administration can find 
a way to punish terrorists without harming others 
if i could find a way to take those hostages get them and 
bring them out and that required using the military force of the 
united states make no mistake about it i would do it in an 
instant bush told his press conference on tuesday that was all 
conditional he said he hasnt found a way and doesnt know that 
there is one 
nor was he saying what the united states might be prepared to do 
for iran were that nation to help free the hostages too 
hypothetical to answer bush said but i would simply repeat 
that we are looking for signs of change there are many ways that 
countries who are estranged can get back together 
the goals are clear freedom for the hostages and improved 
relations with iran the punishments and rewards that may be 
involved are intentionally vague to spell them out in advance would 
be to devalue them besides there arent many options available 
the answer also was vague when bush was asked what the 
administration is going to do about the planned sept 1 inauguration 
of a new president of panama the chosen candidate of military boss 
manuel noriega in an aborted election that us observers said was 
stolen the united states wants noriega out but bush said he isnt 
holding his breath waiting for the panamanian strongman to go 
voluntarily 
i dont know for sure what were going to do he said 
not many options there either after more than two years of us 
efforts to get rid of noriega who is under us indictment on drug 
trafficking charges 
bush has proven far more willing than his predecessors to say in 
plain language that he doesnt know something at his rare news 
conferences ronald reagan sometimes misspoke because he tried to 
talk his way around questions rather than acknowledging that he 
didnt have any answer at his frequent ones bush shows no qualms 
about saying i just dont know as he did tuesday when asked 
about prospects for the release of the hostages 
ambiguity can serve domestic purposes too with a multibillion 
drug fighting program to be announced on sept 5 bush said some 
federal money is going to have to be reallocated in order to finance 
the new program without raising taxes he would not say which 
programs will take the budget hits the final decisions 
havent been made bush said 
for the president to telegraph those spending shifts and then 
leave town for his threeweek vacation in kennebunkport maine 
would have been to invite warfare in the bureaucracy as the managers 
of threatened programs lobbied to keep their budgets intact better 
to leave everyone guessing 
stay tuned and we will show you in september how were going 
to allocate the resources for this bush said 
there also are variations after agreeing with budget director 
richard g darman that hed like to see the federal reserve board 
ease interest rates bush was asked whether he also agreed that the 
fed would be to blame if rates dont come down and there is a 
recession 
well said bush id like to go back because i dont 
recall that part of it and take that under advisement and let you 
know at a later date 
what did he say 
he didnt say

killing endangered animals can mean prison but 
landowners may with impunity pluck or bulldoze the last specimen of 
the rarest plant on earth 
federal and state agencies keep lists of hundreds of endangered 
plants some discovered so recently they havent been given latin 
names yet laws that prohibit even molesting endangered animals 
regulate only those plants on public land and the theft or sale of 
rare flora 
we are pointing our fingers at the developing nations of the 
world saying how can you destroy your rain forests yet here we 
are allowing our own plant species to become extinct says jora 
young director of stewardship for the nature conservancy in florida 
the lack of concern for plants is ironic ecologists say since 
plants have been more useful than have animals besides providing 
most of the food we eat they produce morphine aspirin digitalis 
atropine alcohol mustard menthol quinine curare germicides 
pesticides and scores of other useful substances 
a lot of plants may not be important now but they may some day 
save lives says richard wunderlin president of the florida 
native plant society 
florida ranks third in the nation for the number of endangered 
plants behind california and texas wunderlin said it also boasts 
at least for now many rare species found nowhere else in the 
country or even the world 
in florida the problem is acute booming development is wiping 
out native plant habitats from the hardwood hammocks in the tropical 
keys to scrub land in central florida and pine woods along the 
apalachicola river 
the state has created an endangered plant advisory council but 
its powers are limited to placing species on a list that merely 
regulates their sale 
were adding more plants to the list all the time says 
council chairman dan austin a botany professor at florida atlantic 
university in boca raton but it doesnt protect the plants 
people can do just about anything they want and nobody outside can 
stop them 
many environmentalists have given up on crowded southeastern 
florida austin said only 1 percent of the native scrub land in palm 
beach county still survives in broward county it has all but 
disappeared the main battleground is now central florida where 
rare plant species are succumbing not only to development but to the 
spread of the citrus industry 
wunderlin points in frustration to a newly discovered species of 
the rattlebox plant that is so new it doesnt even have a scientific 
name it is known only in two locations both housing developments 
near avon park 
the species is disappearing lot by lot we will propose it be 
put on the federal protective list but its still on private 
property so that wont protect it at all each time we go into the 
fields more have disappeared 
the federal government lists only 27 plants for protection 
plants on the list cant be destroyed if they are found on a 
federally funded project such as a dam or public housing but that 
represents a tiny fraction of the development in most areas austin 
said the state does not have any similar prohibitions for the 139 
endangered and 280 threatened plants on its list 
placing a plant on the list isnt always easy because development 
and farm interests routinely oppose such efforts austin said it 
also gives landowners who find endangered plants on property they 
intend to develop an incentive to destroy them quickly to avoid 
later headaches thats perfectly legal 
if youre a developer and you own the last population of the 
big pine partridge pea you can bulldoze it said ms young as 
long as you dont steal if from a federal preserve or try to sell 
it youre ok 
plants have historically gotten short shrift under old english 
law animals which moved through the property of many people 
belonged to the crown making them in effect a public trust but 
plants remained on one spot and were totally the property of the 
landowner 
and people being animals themselves are subject to what ms 
young called the bambi syndrome 
if i talk about the impending extinction of the key deer 
people say oh thats terrible what can we do she said but 
if i say this little mint that occurs only in two places on the 
lake wales ridge is very close to extinction they just shrug and 
say thats too bad 
that prejudice she said is not based on reality besides their 
value to humans lower plants are often food for higher animals and 
their destruction can have unknown implications on the environment 
although state officials and environmentalists see little hope 
for a sudden broad shift in the legal and political climate there 
are some hopeful signs 
dade county has begun to protect some native trees although 
without protecting the habitat they need to survive said julia 
morton a university of miami biologist its only quantitative 
dealing with numbers 
another alternative ms morton found hopeful is transplanting 
rare species to exotic plant nurseries if the developing landowner 
agrees 
that approach while often the only realistic one is inadequate 
wunderlin said in the wild they are very variable genetically by 
removing only a few plants and cultivating them you are preserving 
only a very small proportion 
if they are reintroduced they cant resist extreme conditions he 
added 
environentalists and experts unanimously praised the nature 
conservancy which has bought 400000 acres of environmentally 
sensitive land around florida over the last 25 years it often acts 
as an agent for the state quickly buying the land and then holding 
it until the state bureaucracy is ready to buy it 
the conservancy recently bought a site along the apalachicola 
river that is the last refuge of an endangered evergreen tree it 
has preserved ancient dunes in the lake wales ridge area that are 
the only known home of endangered species such as the scrub plum and 
the pygmy fringe tree and it is buying hammock areas on key largo 
that harbor a variety of tree and plant species 
despite an increase in environmental consciousness austin said 
protecting animals while ignoring plants is like a watchmaker 
taking a watch apart and throwing half the pieces away then trying 
to put it back together 
each day environmentalists say more pieces of the watch are 
disappearing

theyre people haunted by regret over choices 
in life if only they say but its too late now 
theyre the people who are always thinking about the past 
said psychologist arthur freeman such ruminators mired in 
their pasts believe their lives have been irrevocably altered by 
choices theyd like to change 
what they think of is how things were they dont see the flip 
side of how things are said freeman a professor at the 
university of medicine and dentistry of new jersey and the 
university of pennsylvania 
they can be recognized as soon as they start talking about their 
problems he said they say i look at the past and see more 
failure than success i would like to change my job but its 
too late i should have become an artist or i could be 
happy if only i were rich 
freeman encourages his patients at penns center for cognitive 
therapy to rethink such comments if only i hadnt given up my 
career to have children becomes i have three wonderful loving 
children 
in a new book wouldacouldashoulda silver arrow books 
1795 freeman and rose dewolf of the philadelphia daily news 
explore secondguessing outline a course of action and using 
specific situations describe how readers can either fall back into 
the habit or break it 
insight in and of itself is not sufficient to change 
freeman said im more interested in what keeps you doing the same 
stuff and how you can change change is the name of the game not 
just sitting here talking about change but actively working on 
change 
the first step is acknowledging a problem and wanting change 
ruminators should examine their assumptions such as having an 
unlimited skill id be happy if i were a successful surgeon 
or being able to know the future wed be rich if i had sold the 
stock at a higher price 
the next step is to write down the advantanges or disadvantages 
as a way to evaluate the change and the persons willingness to risk 
it 
freeman encourages his patients to challenge their thinking and 
conclusions by examining the assumptions inherent in their 
statements once the assumptions are understood he said ruminators 
should decide a course of action 
his former dentist in the midst of a successful practice and 
teaching position at penn decided to become an engineer after 
several years of night school while continuing to work he graduated 
and reached his goal an example freeman cites of goals that are 
not unattainable but have to be accomplished step by step failure 
to overcome the problem usually occurs when a person cant take the 
final step and risk a change 
making a change is difficult freeman said the 
wouldacouldashoulda person thinks of the endpoint but refuses to 
get involved in the process 
once the change is made a former ruminator may have trouble with 
others who want to continue that thought pattern freemans book 
suggests several methods for avoiding that trap which he calls a 
tug of war 
the message of this book is that it is possible to look back in 
a new way he wrote the key to progress in life is returning to 
the present the hall of memories becomes a fascinating place to 
visit no longer a place in which to live or even linger

most families disrupted by violence have contact 
with police and welfare agencies before their troubles escalate to 
assault or death but the agencies dont share information says a 
centers for disease control study 
the cdc study of 284 killings assaults and other family violence 
in 1984 in atlanta shows there is a good chance you can identify 
both the victims and perpetrators of family violence before someone 
comes in dead said dr linda saltzman an epidemiologist who 
designed it we have to work at protecting these people before 
violence escalates to lifethreatening proportions 
the 100000 study found that one in five murder victims was 
married living with or otherwise related to the killer one in four 
who killed a lover or relative was known by police social workers 
or public health to have had a history of assaulting family members 
and more than 60 percent of the victims and perpetrators had been in 
contact with at least two public agencies 
other research has shown that family violence is common and those 
who commit violent crimes often have police records the cdc study 
suggests that both victims and perpetrators routinely have contact 
with public agencies 
were looking at why were not always sharing information and 
seeing what we can do said dr ardith peters of the atlanta 
department of public safety 
however even if police know who is most prone to violence they 
cant prevent crimes in all cases she said the richest city in 
the world cant afford to be social workers at large to the world so 
the question becomes how do you most effectively deploy the 
resources you have

a search of crater lake 
has turned up more than the hot springs scientists were seeking 
in recent weeks the researchers have found mysterious aquablue 
pools of dense fluid black mud of unknown origin and a new kind 
of mite last year and again this summer they found white and 
orange bacterial mats 
a sample of the black mud and samples of the bacteria and the 
blue water that apparently feeds the bacteria were returned tuesday 
from the lakes 1550footdeep south basin said jim milestone the 
park biologist the mud looks like oil he said its 
definitely a mud with fine grains in it 
the first of three blue pools of fluid were found the week 
before ive never seen anything like it said oregon state 
university oceanographer jack dymond who heads the project with osu 
oceanographer robert collier 
the first pool was about 6 feet deep by 3 feet by 8 feet 
precipitates surrounded the pool with yellow deposits milestone 
said we dont know at this time if these are precipitates or a 
new type of bacteria the two pools found since using the special 
deep rover submarine are 14 to 16 feet long 
the new mite dubbed the crater lake mite was found on rock 
samples taken from the bottom of the lake milestone said its a 
species that eats algae indicating that algae live in the lake up 
to 450 feet deep 
dymond and collier believe the 2000footdeep lake in the 
caldera of the 7000yearold mount mazama volcano was formed by a 
geothermal spring it is on a national park service list of parks 
with significant thermal features and the agency must report to 
congress next year if it should stay on the list 
if hot springs are found the government could limit geothermal 
drilling and development outside the park the scientists say a 
minimum difference of 10 degrees celsius is necessary to qualify the 
lake as a hydrothermal spring

wilfrid nixon has true grit and he hopes 
to mix it with water and make ice strong enough for offshore arctic 
oil platforms 
some companies have built drilling platforms of ice but adding 
sand would make it stronger and you could make the structure 
quicker because youre adding less water to achieve the same 
volume said nixon whose is studying alluviumreinforced ice at 
the university of iowa 
ive spoken with some of the engineers at mobil who do research 
in the ice area they think its a good idea he said so did the 
national science foundation which gave him a 35000 grant in 
november to test his theory 
clad in sandals and a shortsleeved shirt nixon oversees 
experiments done in 23degree temperatures at the institute of 
hydraulic research lab where he and associates freeze water and 
different types and blends of sand into beams and cylinders some of 
them seven feet long and weighing 1000 pounds weve tested 400 
beams and anticipate testing another 400 before its all over 
in the arctic sand could be shipped in or dredged from the sea 
bed and mixed with water from huge great versions of snow making 
machines used to make the base a base of sand and ice would weigh 
about 10 tons nixon said 
platform bases have made of steel concrete and ice with sand 
and ice he said a base for a drilling platform would take about 
30 days as opposed to 50 days for just the ice sixty to 90 days is 
typically how long it takes to get it constructed with the other 
materials 
nixon estimates a company could save 500000 with a sandice 
base 
he hopes to test his theories at a reservoir near iowa city if 
its cold enough this winter wed basically throw a hole in the 
ice and drop through two tubes one to get water and the other to 
get whatevers on the bottom wed suck them up spray them out and 
hopefully create a small platform base maybe 10 feet in diameter

sea containers ltd which leases shipping 
containers and runs ferries said its board has rejected a sweetened 
1 billion takeover bid and is making plans instead for a cash 
payout to shareholders 
sea containers is based in hamilton bermuda and operates 
ferries in the english channel 
sea containers board said wednesday the revised bid from temple 
holdings ltd which is owned by swedens stena holdings ag and 
britains tiphook plc was inadequate and not in the best interests 
of the company and its shareholders 
the board recommend that shareholders refuse to tender their 
shares under terms of the offer which is scheduled to expire aug 
28 
at the same time the board directed management to proceed with 
previously disclosed efforts to develop a recapitalization plan that 
would involve a substantial cash distribution to shareholders 
and the issue of new common stock and other securities 
it said management had hired the investment firm goldman sachs amp 
co to advise on arranging financing for the recapitalization 
the board said it would propose a recapitalization even if the 
temple bid were withdrawn 
temple disclosed tuesday that it was raising its tender offer for 
sea containers common stock to 63 a share from 50 and for its 
convertible preferred stock to 10143 per share from 8050 
a spokesman for temple said the new bid valued sea containers at 
102 billion up from 824 million in the initial bid launched may 
26 
stena already owns about 8 percent of sea containers stock 
in trading on the new york stock exchange sea containers rose 
112 a share to 6825 
in another development the debt rating service standard amp poors 
corp said it was continuing to review whether to lower sea 
containers credit ratings sampp has been reviewing the matter since 
temple launched its unsolicited bid

whittle communications picked philips consumer 
electronics co for the 150 millionplus assignment of building a 
video pipeline that will carry its commercially sponsored channel 
one news show to classrooms 
the knoxville tennbased media concern said wednesday it chose 
philips over two other contenders for the job of making and 
installing 300000 television sets 16000 videocassette recorders 
and 8000 satellite dishes at participating schools 
the contract award came on the heels of turner broadcasting 
system incs launch earlier this week of a daily commercialfree 
news program tailored for schools on its cable news network 
the turner program called cnn newsroom is being delivered 
without the huge donation of equipment that whittle plans to provide 
the contract with philips a subsidiary of north american philips 
corp which in turn is a unit of the dutch conglomerate philips 
industries nv is the companys largest single order of this type 
the other contenders were japans sony corp and videostar 
connections a subsidiary of general motors corps electronic data 
systems corp 
atlantabased videostar had supplied installed and serviced the 
hardware for whittles 25show channel one test in six schools last 
spring 
whittle chairman christopher whittle said philips won the job 
because of a combination of service and price but declined to 
specify just what separated the three bids 
he said his company would borrow from banks to pay for the 
equipment which is whittles largest single undertaking to date 
whittle communications which is 50 percent owned by time warner 
inc reported revenue of 152 million for the year ended june 30 
philips said it plans to start building color magnavox brand tv 
sets for the project at its greeneville tenn plant later this 
year it expects to add more than 200 manufacturing employees at the 
facility 
philips has contracted with rsisatcom technologies division of 
duluth ga to manufacture the satellite dishes and install and 
service the tv sets vcrs and satellite systems in the schools 
whittle expects to have 1000 schools hooked up when it launches 
channel one nationally in march 1990 and hopes to have 8000 schools 
by the end of 1990 
asked how many schools have signed up to date whittle said he 
did not intend to give a running total but said signup efforts would 
begin in earnest with the start of the school year 
he also declined to say which advertisers have signed up for the 
program during the test run last spring each channel one program 
carried two minutes of ads for jeans sneakers candy bars shampoo 
and other products 
the advertising has outraged some national education groups who 
say companies should not be allowed to pitch products to students in 
the classroom 
the new york state board of regents banned channel one from the 
states public schools because of the ads and the top education 
official in california said public schools that run channel one 
there risk losing some state aid 
but whittle said there is no other realistic way besides selling 
advertising time to pay the 2 million weekly cost of both producing 
the news show and equipping schools to see it

the us international trade commission says it 
has set a final hearing oct 31 on the request of american telephone 
manufacturers for steep antidumping duties on small business phone 
systems from japan taiwan and south korea 
the action wednesday follows a us commerce department 
preliminary finding that 12 manufacturers in the three asian 
countries were exporting the systems to the united states at prices 
far below fair market value 
the purpose of the hearing is to determine whether us makers 
are substantially threatened by the imports the commission is 
expected to announce its decision in november 
a us government investigation was requested by american 
telephone amp telegraph co and comdial corp 
atampt and other us makers said the asian manufacturers had 
captured about 60 percent of the us market for small business 
phone systems and their own sales had declined dramatically the 
systems provide telephone links within companies separate from the 
general telephone network to which they may be connected for 
outside calling 
foreign companies named in the action included toshiba and 
matsushita of japan samsung and goldstar in south korea and taiwan 
nitsuko and sun moon star in taiwan the commerce department said 
the united states in 1988 imported 7757 million worth of small 
business phone systems and partly assembled systems from japan 342 
million worth from taiwan and 227 million worth from south korea

imports accounted for more than half of the 
countrys domestic petroleum consumption last month surging past 
the 50 percent mark for the first time in 12 years the american 
petroleum institute reports 
a lot of this oil is coming from the middle east the unstable 
middle east said institute spokesman rg ensz it means 
dollars are leaving the country to pay for this oil 
the apis monthly statistical report released wednesday found 
oil imports accounted for 504 percent of domestic consumption in 
july up from 435 percent in july 1988 
the report said domestic deliveries of petroleum products 
averaged just under 17 million barrels a day while total imports 
crude oil plus petroleum products averaged over 85 million 
barrels 
julys total was only the fourth time ever that a monthly import 
figure had exceeded 50 percent the institute said in march 1977 
and july 1977 imports surged to 518 percent of total deliveries 
while in may 1977 imports reached 505 percent 
ensz said the new figures indicate were growing more dependent 
on foreign oil while congress is putting moratoria on offshore 
drilling 
legislation is moving through congress he said that would stop 
drilling for oil in alaska and off the coasts of california western 
florida the midatlantic and new england 
the move toward the bans comes after the exxon valdez tanker 
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into the pristine 
waters of alaksas prince william sound 
what theyre overlooking is more foreign oil means more 
tankers in us waters ensz said all of our foreign oil 
except that which comes from canada has to come by tanker 
the growing traffic of oil tankers in turn raises the potential 
for another oil tanker spill he said 
the api said the highest percentage of oil imports for a full 
year was 477 percent in 1977 for the first seven months of this 
year imports averaged 462 percent of deliveries compared with 
415 percent for all of 1988 
and while imports were rising up 179 percent in july compared 
with the same month a year ago domestic crude production has 
continued to decline api said domestic crude production in july 
averaged 75 million barrels a day 71 percent less than during 
july 1988 
some lawmakers are proposing tax incentives this year to 
encourage domestic oil production but sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
chairman of the taxwriting senate finance committee has said he 
believes such legislation may have a better chance of passing next 
year 
bentsen has said the increasing dependence on foreign oil adds to 
the trade deficit and threatens national security 
but he believes tax incentives to encourage drilling for domestic 
reserves will be difficult to enact this year because of a lack of 
meaningful progress in cutting the budget deficit incentives would 
add to the budget shortfall

amid an unfolding criminal investigation of dozens 
of futures traders the nations two leading exchanges are 
developing an electronic watchdog to make sure trading pits are on 
the upandup 
if the system works as planned floor traders will graduate from 
the pencilandpad era of recording hundreds of millions of trades 
annually 
the idea is to close a gap that gives unscrupulous traders room 
to manipulate their deals without a precise record of what theyve 
done 
under the system being developed by the chicago board of trade 
and the chicago mercantile exchange traders will record their deals 
immediately using handheld devices that transmit the data into the 
exchange computers 
these instruments will not have an eraser on one end merc 
executive leo melamed said wednesday 
among the 46 indicted traders at the two exchanges some were 
accused of simply changing prices on their penciledin records when 
it would mean a profit for themselves or confederates 
melamed said the new system would provide an audit trail that 
could prevent most if not all of the indictable offenses the 
government identified in its 2year undercover investigation 
the improved audit trail system said merc spokesman andrew 
yemma would give an almost instantaneous recording of all the 
pertinent data of a trade the price the trading partner the 
commodity and the time of the transaction 
under the present system floor traders record their trades by 
writing on cards which are picked up at the pits by clerks every 30 
minutes or so 
in 85 percent of the trades the time of the transaction is 
correct to within a minute said yemma but even as short a time as 
a minute can give an unscrupulous trader plenty of opportunity for 
manipulation 
for example a trader who has an extra large purchase order from 
a customer could buy the commodity for his own account first then 
execute the customers order the trader would profit from the jump 
in price triggered by his customers large buy order 
the merc and the board of trade each contributed 25 million 
toward the development for the handheld units and invited other 
us futures exchanges to join in the effort 
while the exchanges were announcing their plans a yen trader at 
the merc entered an innocent plea to charges of racketeering 
conspiracy fraud and violations of the commodities act 
james m marren 39 became the 14th trader to plead innocent 
no trial date has been set for any of the accused and defense 
attorneys told us district judge george marovich on wednesday they 
would like a year or more to wade through the countless documents 
and recorded conversations before going to trial 
the magnitude of the written documents and the tapes and the 
extent of pretrial motions and government responses require that 
much time said defense attorney anthony onesto 
marovich said he wants to move more swiftly than that and 
indicated he would set a trial date at the next hearing on sept 29

investor marvin davis has sweetened his offer for 
ual corp to 62 billion and prepared to wage a possible proxy 
fight to gain control of the companys board 
davis raised his offer for the parent of united airlines to 275 
a share wednesday from his original 240 a share or 54 billion 
bid 
ual stock closed wednesday at 25175 a share on the new york 
stock exchange down 250 davis new bid was revealed after the 
market closed 
ual directors are expected to consider the new offer at a meeting 
today 
spokeswoman sara dornacker said the company would have no comment 
on the sweetened offer before the meeting 
ual also declined comment on davis filing of documents asking 
shareholders to remove all 16 directors other than chairman stephen 
m wolf and replace them with a fivemember board headed by davis 
davis spokesman james fingeroth said the california billionaire 
does not intend at this time to solicit votes against the current 
board 
he said the documents were filed with the securities and exchange 
commission only to establish a time frame aug 16 to oct 15 for 
determining which shareholders would be eligible to vote should 
there be a proxy battle 
the filing was prompted by press reports that raised the 
specter of a transaction which might interfere with the ability of 
shareholders to promptly maximize the value of their investment in 
ual said fingeroth 
daviss offer has sparked interest in ual among other possible 
suitors including the airlines top managers who reportedly met 
with the air line pilots association for discussions of a possible 
managementemployee buyout 
jim damron spokesman for the pilots union refused to comment on 
davis latest moves 
in a statement davis said his offer could go higher after a 
review of the companys financial data 
he said that by the end of next week he should be able to provide 
details of the financing of the proposed deal

the us trade deficit improved dramatically in 
june to 817 billion the smallest imbalance since december 1984 
the government said today 
the commerce department said the june deficit represented a sharp 
189 percent improvement over a revised may deficit of 1008 
billion 
the improvement came from a 15 percent increase in us exports 
which pushed them to a record level of 3091 billion and a 36 
percent drop in imports which fell to 3908 billion the trade 
deficit is the difference between imports and exports 
the overall deficit of 817 billion was the lowest monthly 
imbalance since a 679 billion deficit in december 1984 the june 
figure was immediately hailed as an encouraging sign by the bush 
administration 
at the vacation white house in kennebunkport maine presidential 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said the decline in the trade 
deficit was greater than market expectation and certainly is good 
news for the country the continued rising trend in exports is 
welcome 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher said the improvement showed 
increasing expertise by american exporters in penetrating 
foreign markets 
for the first six months exports increased 15 percent from a 
year ago while imports rose about 8 percent mosbacher said 
economists had been looking for the deficit to narrow but not by 
as large a margin as actually occurred however analysts said the 
figures did not change their overall prediction that the countrys 
trade improvement is in danger of stalling out 
many economists are predicting that the deficits will begin 
rising in the second half of the year as american exports suffer 
from the rising value of the dollar a higher dollar makes us 
goods more expensive on overseas markets 
we are looking for a substantial widening in the deficit in the 
last part of the year as the value of the dollar begins to cut into 
export sales said michael evans head of a washington forecasting 
firm 
for the first half of 1989 the deficit has been running at an 
annual rate of 1086 billion down 84 percent from last years 
total merchandise trade deficit of 1185 billion 
many economists predict however that deficit growth in the last 
half of the year will put the total imbalance for the year exactly 
where it was in 1988 
for june the improvement in exports reflected gains in sales of 
bigticket capital goods and industrial supplies 
the decline in imports which put them at their lowest level 
since april reflected declines in imports of automobiles capital 
goods and industrial supplies 
another major factor in the june improvement was a sharp drop in 
americas foreign oil bill which fell 115 percent to 42 billion 
reflecting declines in both volume and price the amount of imported 
oil fell to 793 million barrels a day from 83 million in may and 
the price per barrel dropped to 1767 from 1840 in may 
however many analysts say oil imports will begin rising in the 
second half of the year as us consumption increases and domestic 
production falls 
in fact an industry group the american petroleum institute 
reported wednesday that imported oil in july accounted for more than 
half of us petroleum needs the first time that has occurred in 12 
years 
as usual the largest trade deficit in june was with japan an 
imbalance of 39 billion down from a may deficit of 43 billion 
the deficit with taiwan totaled 12 billion in june while the 
deficit with china was 700 million 
some economists said any further significant improvement in the 
trade deficit probably will not occur until the country heads into a 
recession an economic slump would cause businesses and consumers to 
buy fewer imports these analysts reason 
a worsening trade deficit means a double dose of bad news for the 
bush administration the administration based its predictions of 
healthy economic growth partly on a belief that exports would keep 
expanding if this does not occur it means that the federal budget 
deficit will be higher because tax revenues will be lower 
additionally higher trade deficits increase the pressure on the 
administration to erect protectionist trade measures to keep out 
imports something that it opposes

the stock market was lower in moderately active 
trading today as bond prices fell after an unexpectedly sharp 
narrowing of the june us trade deficit 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was down 1404 points to

volume on the big board totaled 8204 million shares 
the stock and bond markets rallied briefly in response to the 
june merchandise trade deficit but after a closer look at the 
report bond prices tumbled and the stock market followed 
when you look at the composition of the report it shows strong 
exports which is a sign of economic vitality said larry wachtel 
vice president of prudentialbache securities inc 
the commerce department reported the june us trade deficit 
narrowed to 817 billion from a revised 1008 billion in may 
exports increased 15 percent to a record level of 3091 billion 
while imports fell 36 percent to 3908 billion 
the concern is that the gap shows the economy was stronger than 
people thought said alfred e goldman vice president at ag 
edwards amp sons inc

will lower interest rates

congress search for budget savings thus far 
this year still leaves a projected 141 billion deficit for fiscal 
1990 enough to require acrosstheboard cuts in most spending 
programs the congressional budget office said today 
cbo also forecast that if congress approves all the savings 
envisioned in next years budget blueprint the shortfall still 
would be 118 billion well above the 110 billion target set in 
the grammrudman deficitreduction law 
the key message is that we have a very long way to go if the 
deficit is to be brought down to a level americans will be 
comfortable with cbo director robert d reischauer said at a news 
conference 
if current estimates prove accurate he added budget year 1991 
will require a deficitreduction package more than twice the size of 
any previous effort 
the projections by cbo a legislative agency that supplies 
nonpartisan fiscal guidance to congress play no role in 
grammrudman procedures it is the deficit estimates of the white 
houses office of management and budget usually more optimistic 
than cbo that are legally binding 
the cbo figures are however respected by lawmakers and private 
economists who use them to measure the fiscal effects of programs 
and legislative proposals 
if grammrudman deficit targets are surpassed spending cuts in 
defense and many domestic programs can be automatically triggered 
the final decision on whether cuts are needed is made oct 15 
the budget offices estimates include president bushs recent 
approval of the savings and loan bailout law the cost of a drought 
bill and another emergency spending measure that became law this 
year 
the administration today had no specific early reaction to the 
cbo report presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater told 
reporters in kennebunkport maine where bush is vacationing 
fitzwater blamed part of the discrepancy between the cbo estimate 
and the white house figures on different accounting procedures used 
by the two branches of government 
when congress returns after labor day from summer recess it will 
have nearly four weeks of work left to find additional savings 
before the oct 1 start of fiscal 1990 among the measures lawmakers 
are considering is one producing about 13 billion in savings from 
spending cuts and new tax receipts 
congress enacted a 117 trillion budget blueprint for fiscal 
1990 in may many of the savings contemplated in that budget 
however are considered unlikely to be achieved 
for example conflicts between congress and the white house make 
a projected 57 billion in asset sales extremely unlikely 
cbo estimates that the sampl bailout law will add 14 billion to 
this years deficit 4 billion to the 1990 shortfall and a total of 
10 billion over the next four years 
ombs projections of the effect of the sampl bill are expected to 
be much different 
because the bailouts spending next year wont count on the 
budget omb is expected to count a savings of about 125 billion 
resulting from the measures passage according to the republican 
staff of the senate budget committee the savings are claimed 
because without the new law the spending would be on the budget 
cbo projects a 161 billion deficit for this year up from 155 
billion in fiscal 1988 
the budget office says that with no further action deficits 
would reach 144 billion in fiscal 1991 141 billion in 1992 143 
billion in 1993 and 128 billion in 1994 
the 1991 grammrudman deficit target is 64 billion 
omb plans to release its projections next week and it is widely 
expected on capitol hill that it will forecast a 116 billion 
deficit for fiscal 1990

alleged illegal activities on behalf of the milkens deputy 
attorney general h chester horn said wednesday

attorney generals investigation said daniel murdock a new york 
lawyer who represents the foundations we had hoped and 
anticipated that this would be the result 
milken the onetime head of drexel burnham lambert incs junk 
bond department was indicted along with his brother lowell and a 
former associate on 98 criminal counts by a new york federal grand 
jury last march the securities and exchange commission has also 
filed suit against the milkens 
the milkens have pleaded innocent to the criminal charges and the 
sec suit is not expected to proceed until that case is resolved 
the suit and indictments stem from a lengthy investigation into 
milkens activities at drexel he recently resigned from the 
investment firm and started his own business 
the milkens have donated 350 million to the four charitable 
foundations since 1982 the donations included 1924 million by 
milken and his wife in 1987 when he made 550 million at drexel 
the organizations grouped as the foundations of the milken 
families have assets of 380 million they have made 45 million in 
cash donations to dozens of organizations since 1982 
the foundations best known program involves cash awards to 
outstanding educators in california and three other states 
californias inquiry focused on six securities transactions at 
the foundations between 1982 and 1988 that involved milken and other 
parties related to the organizations 
one of the transactions was the 1986 sale of 145 million in 
bonds by the capital fund to a company owned by michael and lowell 
milken 
california law permits such socalled relatedparty dealings if 
they do not damage the charitable foundation involved 
the attorney generals probe determined that the foundations 
profited substantially from all six transactions which authorities 
said were conducted at fairmarket value

mississippis top economic development 
official says the state has two images in corporate america bad 
and none at all and hopes to correct that with a new national 
advertising campaign 
the first of the ads which describe mississippi as the state 
of change appeared thursday in the eastern and chicago editions 
of the wall street journal 
were trying to make a subtle change in the image of 
mississippi j mac holladay director of the state department of 
economic and community development said wednesday at a news 
conference were trying to get corporate america to look at 
mississippi in a different way 
the states history of civil rights conflicts its high 
illiteracy rate and its low average income levels have created a bad 
image for the state in some quarters holladay has argued that past 
image campaigns have failed to reach the right audience and left 
many people with no image of the state at all 
the fullpage ad carries a quote from 19thcentury british poet 
alfred lord tennyson a photograph of a space shuttle launch and 
copy which points out mississippis links to the us space program 
the national aeronautics and space administration test facility 
in south mississippi has grown over the past 28 years into the 
13480acre stennis space center which houses a space shuttle 
engine testing laboratory and scientific think tank employing more 
than 5500 workers the ad said 
it also notes that nasa earlier this year decided to build a 
solid rocket motor assembly plant in northeast missisippi 
the wall street journals eastern edition is distributed to east 
coast states from maine to florida and in west virginia georgia 
alabama and tennessee the chicago edition reaches metropolitan 
chicago gary ind and milwaukee 
a color version of the ad will appear in forbes business week 
and industry week magazines the department placed 17 ads in the 
wall street journal 10 in business week nine in forbes and five in 
industry week 
additional ads are being developed holladay said 
the second ad will focus on the states workforce with a photo of 
the march 8 edition of national geographic magazine as the 
centerpiece the magazine is printed in corinth 
the third ad planned for this spring is to focus on a new 
education reform package on which gov ray mabus and his staff are 
working holladay said if the legislature does not approve the 
governors program weve got a lot of strong things to put in 
there 
the ads were developed by department staffers at a cost of less 
than 30000 godwin group a jackson advertising agency helped 
with copywriting and some photography holladay said 
he said the department placed its own ads and has spent about 
818550 on the campaign 
the state legislature in its 1989 session appropriated 2 million 
to the department with the amount to be divided equally among 
corporate and tourism advertising programs 
holladay said the ninemonth program that begins with the wall 
street journal ads was just a beginning 
we cant do this just one year and stop the next year he 
said 
holladay said he would ask the 1990 legislature to double the 
departments advertising budget

opposition by guatemalan archeological and 
environmental officials recently prompted exxon corp to scrap a 
multimillion dollar oil drilling project planned among mayan ruins 
in a rain forest the company says 
the showdown over the project in the central american nation came 
as the giant oil company faced continued scrutiny and criticism from 
government officials and environmentalists in the united states over 
the disastrous oil spill in march off the alaskan coast by the 
tanker exxon valdez 
but exxon said thursday that its decision to terminate the 
project at two sites in central guatemala including the 
governmentprotected el ceibal national park was not prompted by 
the us uproar over the alaskan spill 
while valdez certainly has focused more attention on exxon 
overall it did not influence our decision concerning withdrawing 
from guatemala said exxon spokeswoman ann frechette 
exxon said it spent 214 million during four years of 
preliminary testing at the guatemalan sites 
the new yorkbased company received permission to drill from 
guatemalas ministry of energy and mines but culture ministry 
archeologists in late may physically blocked exxon workers from 
moving equipment into el ceibal 
exxon is a very important company but guatemala is more 
important guatemala president vinicio cerezo said recently in 
announcing exxons withdrawal 
el ceibal site of ruins including dirt mounds that archeologists 
believe may be mayan burial sites was declared a protected area 
after exxon began testing there 
frechette said wednesday that the company received drilling 
permission from the ministry of energy and mines in may and 
consulted with environmental and archeological officials during the 
projects preparation 
what we did was to make a careful study of the vicinity where 
we wanted to drill in cooperation with a local archeologist to help 
us ensure that where we drilled would not in any way compromise the 
integrity of the nearby ruins she said 
frechette said that once drilling started exxon planned to 
monitor the site to keep workers away from mayan ruins and to 
handclear dirt from some areas 
in early june when our equipment showed up to enter the park we 
were prevented by doing so by members of the culture ministry she 
said they basically said you cannot enter this park you cannot 
do this work 
vocal opposition also came from the governments national 
commission on the environment and political figures according to 
reports from guatemala 
several weeks after it was barred from el ceibal exxon decided 
to pull out of guatemala it seemed to be something that was not 
going to be resolved frechette said 
exxon formed esso exploration guatemala in 1985 to conduct 
exploratory activities the company conducted preliminary seismic 
testing and identified two areas to drill wells exxon performed 
test drilling at the first site known as machaquila but it proved 
unproductive 
the guatemala project was one of exxons frontier exploration 
groups to identify possible oil and gas deposits around the world 
elsewhere in latin america exxon earlier this year closed a 
project in ecuador after conducting exploratory drilling but has an 
active exploratory program in northern argentina exxon also is 
producing oil and gas and mining coal in colombia and mining copper 
in chile

cautioning that a us trade deficit was partly caused by third 
world debt 
perez speaking in his twice monthly press conference added that 
the position was not an ultimatum 
we cannot say this or nothing but the conclusion is that we 
must seek more or less this 50 percent reduction because it is what 
we need said perez 
venezuela has insisted in preliminary conversations with its 
commercial creditors that it needs to cut its annual debt burden in 
half in order to meet its commitments and generate needed economic 
growth 
banking representatives rejected venezuelas initial position 
late last month reportedly claiming venezuela was in better shape 
to meet its debt payments than mexico the first country to reach an 
agreement with banks on debt reductions 
mexicos creditors agreed last month to a threetiered approach 
to reducing that countrys 54 billion commercial debt a 35 percent 
reduction in debts a ceiling on interest rates or fresh loans to 
help make back payments 
venezuela stopped paying capital on its 33 billion debt the 
fourth largest in the developing world in january and stopped 
interest payments in february 
perez quoted former president reagan in warning that if third 
world countries did not succeed in alleviating the burden of foreign 
debt trade deficits in the industrialized countries would grow 
worse 
i remember when reagan said that if latin america had been 
buying us products in the 80s at the same rate they were buying 
in the 70s the us would not be suffering its tremendous trade 
deficit he said 
latin american economists have called the 80s the lost 
decade as the countries of the region have sunk into an economic 
tailspin blamed largely on the debt burden

the price of soybeans for august delivery fell 
sharply thursday on the chicago board of trade in a selloff sparked 
by ideas that the italian grain giant ferruzzi was liquidating some 
large holdings 
other soybean futures prices closed mostly higher while most 
grain futures finished slightly lower 
ferruzzi finanziaria spa one of the worlds largest grain 
processors is believed to hold a large number of contracts to take 
delivery of soybeans against the august contract which expires 
tuesday 
heavy selling of soybean contracts thursday by trading companies 
with close ties to ferruzzi prompted a flurry of selling by others 
seeking to profit from the drop in prices that a largescale 
selloff by ferruzzi could cause 
traders had no proof that ferruzzi was actually a seller but 
thats the perception said dale gustafson an analyst with 
drexel burnham lambert inc in chicago 
the italian firm is believed to have accumulated a large position 
in august soybean futures after being forced by the board of trade 
to abandon a huge position in the july contract last month 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 397 a bushel corn was 2 
cents lower to cent higher with september at 235 a bushel oats 
were 1 cent to 1 cents lower with september at 137 a bushel 
soybeans were 16 cents lower to 6 cents higher with august off 16 
cents at 607 a bushel

it was bad enough turning up on squeaky 
frommes hit list because you are the chairman of a company called 
fluorocarbon co 
but when a flood of investors started acting as if the company 
was called toxic sludge unlimited peter churm figured it was time 
for a name change 
since the mid1950s his company has made expensive custom seals 
gaskets bearings and the like from teflon and related plastics 
materials known as fluorocarbons 
the products are used by a number of big companies whirlpool 
corp caterpillar inc boeing co navistar and every space 
shuttle that roars off the launch pad has 100000 in fluorocarbon 
seals aboard 
they are as safe as peanut butter said churm 
tell that to investors who are worried about chlorofluorocarbons 
the compounds used in aerosols and refrigerants that are believed to 
eat holes in earths protective ozone layer 
a lot of the investors thought that was the business we were 
in churm said 
this has been developing over the last few years and finally 
in the last six months we were getting calls from brokers who would 
say were not going to put any of our clients in your stock 
because it takes too long to explain that youre not the bad guys 
its not just wouldbe stock buyers who have been confused 
lynette squeaky fromme the homicidal follower of charles manson 
who aimed a gun at president ford scrawled churms name on her 
lengthy hit list of businessmen and politicians because he was 
fluorocarbons chairman 
fromme has been locked up since 1975 but it wasnt until this 
year that churm decided to ditch the name 
theres a twist however hes going to let the public pick the 
new one 
contest entries are due by aug 31 with the winner expected to 
be announced by the end of september the prize is 100 shares of 
fluorocarbon stock which has been trading at about 16 per share 
churm owns about 10 percent of the 65 million shares 
churm said more than 1600 letters have arrived at the companys 
headquarters in laguna niguel containing 6000 suggested names some 
more serious than others 
one guy said instead of fluorocarbon make it flour garden 
churm said one letter came from a lady who said if you really 
want to clear the air name it not chlorofluorocarbon inc 
another wag wrote if youre so concerned about health and the 
environment why dont you name it the oat bran co 
most suggestions are more mundane surefit co fluoroseals 
fluorotonics polyfluor american polymer 
churm says the new name will probably sound a lot like the old 
an idea endorsed by robert berglass the chairman of dep corp in 
compton 
sales of deps ayds weightreduction candy had fallen more than 
50 percent due to publicity about aids before the company caved in 
this year by repackaging the product and renaming it diet ayds 
we wanted to soften it without completely changing it and 
losing the name identification berglass said he said sales are 
moving back up although he is reluctant to predict a full recovery 
fluorocarbon should also revise instead of abandon its name he 
said 
change it to fluorotef because their biggest product is 
teflon isnt it berglass suggested 
thats a good name replied churm but hes too late 
somebody else already came up with it

the stock market fell in moderately active 
trading today pressured by a sharply narrower us trade deficit 
that showed unexpected strength in the economy 
wall street analysts said the decline was broadbased and came in 
response to a fall in the bond market 
both markets initially rallied after the report but a closer 
examination aroused bondholders concern that the economy is too 
strong and that the federal reserve might not ease credit

the concern is that the gap shows the economy was stronger than 
people thought said alfred e goldman vice president at ag 
edwards amp sons inc 
although the data is good for the economy the market is not 
satisfied said eugene peroni technical analyst with janney 
montgomery scott 
its looking for things that would compel the fed to ease 
lower interest rates are good because they would tend to fuel the 
economy and bring borrowing rates down peroni said 
fridays report on consumer prices could provide further evidence 
of the economys growth consensus expectations are for the consumer 
price index to edge up 02 percent analysts said 
but a much higher cpi number could be interpreted as inflationary 
and therefore bearish for the market because it would further dim 
hopes of the fed lowering interest rates analysts said

eastern airlines president phil bakes says the 
carrier is doing so well at overcoming its strike that the rebuilt 
eastern will be bigger than first announced 
the airlines going to be larger than what we projected last 
april bakes said in an interview wednesday evening we will 
have more employees it will service more cities and well have 
more airplanes 
were very pleased bakes said of easterns progress since it 
announced plans to rebuild at twothirds its prestrike size from 
chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization despite the 5monthold strike 
by its unions what we announced last april was the impossible and 
there were a lot of skeptics to say the least 
the fact is were exceeding targets and we will accelerate 
the schedule a little bit bakes said 
among the revised increased plans he said are 
instead of the 17000 employees planned there will be 
18000plus maybe more 
instead of the 1700 pilots planned there will be more in the 
next year or two maybe in the next few months in small groups 
instead of 157 aircraft eastern next year will fly from 165 to 
180 planes and also has the first nine of 40 new boeing aircraft on 
order available for 1992 
instead of 800 daily flights serving 77 cities eastern will 
probably add cities and flights but no figures have been decided 
upon 
instead of 18 billion in asset sales the figure may be as low 
as 15 billion fewer assets may be sold because transactions such 
as aircraft sales philadelphia gates and the northeast shuttle sale 
have earned more money than expected and eastern is winning back 
customers at faster rates than expected bakes said 
negotiations reportedly with rival american airlines have 
continued on the possible sale of another major eastern asset its 
south american routes but bakes declined to give details he said 
he wouldnt place odds on whether the routes will be sold 
a spokesman for the air line pilots association which was 
meeting in executive session in washington said time would tell 
whether bakes projections hold true 
the companys promised a lot of things since the beginning of 
the strike and bankruptcy some of them theyve delivered and some 
they havent spokesman john mazor said 
mazor said eastern still has a training bottleneck for newly 
hired pilots and also is having trouble hiring mechanics to replace 
strikers 
with the alpa leadership discussing possibly ending the pilots 
strike veteran pilots by the dozens crossed picket lines last week 
eastern last friday said it had stopped hiring pilots or accepting 
strikers back 
bakes said eastern has 750 to 800 union pilots who are crossing 
picket lines he said it has graduated 300 new pilots and has 700 in 
training 
alpa contends that any union pilot must get job preference over a 
pilot still in training but bakes said eastern is committed to 
protecting the pilots in training 
they became employees of the company the day they started 
training he said the people who came back last week ought to 
get down on their hands and knees and thank the people who are in 
training who left jobs at other carriers left their jobs at 
corporations retired from the military moved their families took 
their chances 
we are going to protect those people thats why we shut the 
door they are going to be out flying bakes said the fact is 
most of the people still out there striking have lost their 
careers at eastern airlines thats sad and that didnt have to be 
but we dont look back we have to move forward 
he said eastern has hired about 800 new mechanics since the 
strike started march 4 had 150 machinists union members cross 
picket lines and has 1000 nonunion supervisors assigned to 
maintenance duties eastern plans to have 2400 to 2500 mechanics 
but will contract out routine maintenance as needed bakes said 
eastern is temporarily leasing 15 planes and crews from sister 
carrier continental airlines to meet its planned increase in 
schedule sept 7 when eastern says it will jump from 390 daily 
flights to 600 bakes rejected suggestions that the deal is another 
example of how predominantly nonunion continental is being used to 
break easterns strike and how eastern cash is upstreamed to 
texas air corp parent of eastern and continental 
bakes said such wetlease deals are traditional in the 
airline industry and that eastern will profit on the routes flown 
for it by continental

the dollar rose sharply worldwide on thursday 
bolstered by a betterthanexpected us trade report but its gains 
were capped by profittaking and uncertainty over whether the upward 
momentum can continue 
the rise brought the dollar back to almost to the highs reached 
in june the period of its most recent rally 
gold prices were mixed on the commodity exchange in new york 
gold bullion for current delivery gained 10 cents to close at 
36830 troy ounce republic national bank of new york said gold was 
bid later at 36620 an ounce down from 36650 on wednesday 
the us currency began gaining ground following a commerce 
department report that showed the june trade deficit narrowed to 
817 billion the smallest since december 1984 and down 
dramatically from a revised gap of 1008 billion in may 
a low deficit is seen as positive for the dollar because it makes 
traders believe the currency probably wont have to decline any 
further to help improve the us trade picture 
the market believes that were heading for a soft landing and 
not a recession for the time being said scott horwitz a vice 
president at the bank of boston 
with that in mind the market is tempted to think the federal 
reserve may not ease as rapidly as we thought he added 
referring to interest rates lower interest rates make us 
securities more expensive and therefore less attractive to foreign 
investors 
profittaking both at home and abroad as well as rumors of 
intervention took the dollar down from its peak levels in hectic 
trading 
the variables here are the central banks said ian spence 
chief dealer at manufacturers hanover trust co theres a lot of 
uncertainty over whether the dollar will go much higher 
traders also were looking to fridays release of the consumer 
price index for july for further evidence that economic growth is 
continuing and that monetary policy need not be altered

concern about interest rates shook the stock 
market thursday and sent prices down in the busiest day this week 
the drop came in response to a sharp decline in the bond market 
after release of the june us trade deficit report the numbers 
showed a surprising narrowing of the deficit that suggested 
underlying strength in the economy 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 1366 points to 
finish at 267963 after trading down about 25 points during the 
session last thursday the dow jones average closed at 271263 
near the alltime high of 272242 reached in august 1987 
the dow jones transportation average gained 2667 to set another 
record at 142834 due largely to takeover speculation in airline 
stocks 
declining issues outnumbered gainers by a margin of about 8 to 5 
in nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
887 issues down 561 up and 540 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 15756 million 
shares up from 15006 million in wednesdays session 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 18556 million shares 
the commerce department reported that the june us trade deficit 
narrowed to 817 billion from a revised 1008 billion in may the 
improvement was due mainly to a 15 percent increase in exports to a 
record level of 3091 billion while imports fell 36 percent to 
3908 billion 
the stock and bond markets initially rallied after the report 
which eased recession worries but closer inspection aroused 
bondholders concern that the economy is too strong and that the 
federal reserve might not ease credit conditions 
what should have been interpreted as good news for the overall 
economy was bad news for the market said larry wachtel analyst 
with prudentialbache securities inc 
the market is concerned that if the economy is too bubbly the 
fed will not accommodate and lower interest rates wachtel said 
some wall street analysts said however that the market was 
overreacting 
its a kneejerk reaction to sell stocks when bonds go down 
said philip roth equities analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
but thats misplaced because economic strength is good if not 
accompanied by inflation or too strong an economy 
roth said while the fear is that the fed will not lower interest 
rates company earnings are not going to be killed by the fed not 
easing 
despite the busier pace the market was unusually 
featureless with the exception of airline stocks traders said 
as measured by wilshire associates index of more than 5000 
actively traded stocks the market declined 11781 billion or 035 
percent in value from wednesday

copper futures prices rocketed higher thursday on new yorks 
commodity exchange extending to seven days a rally fueled by miner 
strikes tightening supplies bullish chart signals and signs of 
renewed economic strength 
on other markets soybeans for august delivery tumbled energy 
futures were lower most livestock and meat futures advanced ahead 
of a government cattle report and precious metals were narrowly 
mixed 
copper settled 29 cents to 45 cents higher on heavy volume with 
the contract for delivery in august at 12675 the highest 
settlement of a spot contract since may 5 the more active september 
contract settled at 12625 which represents a 15 percent gain 
since aug 8 
copper prices reached a record high of 16475 a pound last dec 
8 
prices initially rose thursday following the commodity exchanges 
report that stocks of copper stored for delivery against futures 
contracts had dropped by 1140 tons wednesday to 16708 tons 
traders follow the daily comex stocks reports as an indicator of 
overall supplies wednesdays sharp drawdown reinforced fears that 
miner strikes in peru and canada as well as production problems in 
other copperrich nations are cutting into supplies as the seasonal 
peak demand period which begins in the fall and ends in the earlyl 
spring approaches 
analysts said the september contract pierced considerable 
technical resistance at 123 a pound bringing in further buying 
that brought it to within about 5 cents of its lifetime high of 
13150 reached on march 8 
analyst james steel of refco inc said the rally was almost 
entirely technically inspired but he also cited the commerce 
departments report of a strong improvement in the trade deficit 
the report signals economic strength a key component of copper 
demand 
soybeans for august delivery fell 15 cents a bushel on the 
chicago board of trade in a selloff sparked by ideas that the 
italian grain giant ferruzzi finanziaria spa was liquidating some 
large holdings the contract settled at 608 a bushel 
heavy selling of soybean contracts thursday by trading companies 
with close ties to ferruzzi prompted a flurry of selling by others 
seeking to profit from the drop in prices that a largescale 
selloff by ferruzzi could cause 
wheat settled 1 cents to 2 cents lower with september at 397 
a bushel corn was 2 cents lower to cent higher with september at 
235 a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents lower with september 
at 137 a bushel soybeans were 15 cents lower to 6 cents higher 
with the september contract at 584 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures ended mostly higher on the chicago 
mercantile exchange in cautious trading ahead of a monthly 
agriculture department report showing 4 percent fewer cattle on 
feedlots aug 1 than on the same date a year ago that number was 
near market expectations but the report also showed more cattle 
placed on feedlots in july than expected which could trigger a drop 
in prices on friday 
live cattle settled 12 cent lower to 60 cent higher with august 
at 7395 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 27 cent 
higher with august at 8465 cents a pound hogs were 35 cent lower 
to 70 cent higher with august at 4785 cents a pound frozen pork

new proposals from cocoa producers to relaunch the 
pricesupport system in world markets are unlikely to be accepted by 
consumers officials of the cocoabuying nations said thursday 
the producers were expected to confer in africa later this month 
on the proposals their officials said 
earlier this year the price of cocoa dropped to a 13year low 
the price was a modest 1311 a ton in london this week 
cocoa is the source of 30 percent of the foreign exchange 
earnings of ivory coast the biggest cocoa producer and is an 
even more important earner for ghana 
the proposals are from a private consultant who has not been 
publicly identified and who is believed to be backed by ivory coast 
the proposals were called wrong on crucial points and 
outrageously unrealistic by some industry experts 
earlier this month ivory coast confirmed it was working on an 
initiative to revive the cocoa agreements marketsupport regime 
which is administered from london by the 41nation international 
cocoa organization 
since then the private consultant acting on behalf of a us 
company that recently bought 500000 metric tons of newcrop ivorian 
cocoa has drafted a discussion document for the cocoa producers 
alliance on how the pact could be resurrected 
the alliance groups all key producers and was expected to meet in 
africa at the end of august 
the cocoa pacts regulatory provisions have been frozen for 18 
months because of a dispute between its producer and consumer 
members over the minimum price a proposed new stockpiling scheme 
should defend and a lack of cash to finance it 
the cash shortage is the result of arrears in producer payments 
to the cocoa organization of almost 115 million ivory coast is the 
largest debtor owing 70 million 
according to the consultants document producers would be asked 
to pay at least part of their debts 
consumer officials say the implementation of most proposals would 
mean amending the cocoa treaty a process requiring lengthy legal 
procedures involving the united nations 
it is not yet certain whether the document will form the basis 
for a joint producer proposal to consumers on reviving the cocoa 
pact at the next cocoa organization meeting in london in september 
members are to make a decision then on what should happen when 
the pact expires at the end of september next year 
traders said if the pacts control function is revived next month 
this would boost the chances of a decision to extend the accord with 
its regulatory power intact for one or two more years 
if there is no extension the 250000ton stockpile already held 
by the cocoa organization will have to be liquidated under current 
rules within 4 years from september 1990 
traders said the sale of so much cocoa would pull down prices 
already depressed by five straight seasons of overproduction and the 
prospect of another in 198990

production and inventory problems produced a 
loss at sun microsystems inc the computer workstation maker while 
creating flat earnings for industry giant hewlettpackard co the

semiconductor manufacturer intel corp that its thirdquarter 
profits could fall reflected a generally flat computer market and 
as well as shifting marketing strategies by the companies and 
problems associated with those changes 
sun microsystems inc of mountain view one of the leading makers 
of technical workstations said it lost 203 million in its fiscal 
fourth quarter ended june 30 in contrast to a profit of 253 
million or 33 cents a share in the final quarter a year earlier

letter in san francisco sun was founded in 1982 
steve ossad an analyst with montgomery securities in san 
francisco warned the company could continue losing money 
i dont sense that its turned around ossad said i 
couldnt rule out continued negative surprises

of the fastestgrowing companies in the country in june warned 
investors of the impending loss and last month hinted that a return 
to profitability wasnt certain in the current quarter on thursday 
the company reiterated that profits cannot be assured for the 
first quarter 
mcnealy and analysts attributed the fourthquarter loss the 
companys first since going public in 1986 to a transition to a 
line of new products saying the company was unable to meet demand 
for the new products introduced in april

drop in thirdquarter earnings for the period ending july 31 on a 23

in may of apollo computer co an industry leader in the technical 
workstation market and two months of apollos operating results

profits would have been 92 cents a share 15 percent higher than the 
same period last year 
for the latest quarter hp said it experienced faltering demand 
for highend minicomputers and electronic components but hp 
apparently had unexpected demand for socalled lowend products 
such as workstations personal computers and pc peripherals 
their earnings shortfall is not dramatic in any shape or 
form said analyst bob herwick of hambrecht amp quist in san 
francisco 
hewlettpackard said it had halted hiring except for select sales 
and support positions and imposed expense controls 
intel the santa clara calif chip maker said in a statement

ian posgate a former star insurance underwriter 
with lloyds of london was acquitted thursday of conspiracy to steal 
60 million of insurance funds to buy a personal stake in a swiss 
bank 
the case had threatened lloyds 300yearold reputation for 
reliability when it broke in 1982 
posgate 57 was called goldfinger at the height of his 
success for his midas touch in the city of london financial 
district he took high risks in undercutting premiums to become the 
worlds single largest insurer of shipping with 25 percent of the 
market 
i can only say that i feel totally vindicated after seven very 
long years posgate said thursday after the 15week trial at 
southwark crown court in london 
he said he would not return to lloyds 
posgate had managed lloyds underwriting syndicates controlled by 
the brokerage firm alexander howden posgates codefendant former 
howden chairman kenneth grob 68 also was cleared of theft charges 
the verdict came after three days of deliberations by the jury of 
seven men and five women 
prosecutor michael hill alleged that posgate was lured into a 
plot masterminded by grob that siphoned off millions of dollars from 
their syndicates into secret offshore holdings in panama 
hill said the money was moved to lichtenstein to purchase the 
banque du rhone et de la tamise in geneva 
grob resigned immediately after howdens was taken over in 
january 1982 by the us insurance company alexander and alexander 
services inc for 255 million 
posgate said he was taking part in legitimate insurance dealing 
and grob said contracts signed were legitimate reinsurance to the 
benefit of howdens and he never spent any of the money 
posgate was cleared by a lloyds disciplinary committee in 1984 
which found he was not involved in an agreement to use money taken 
from his syndicate to buy the bank but he was arrested on similar 
charges in 1987

lawsuit thursday against the walt disney co claiming that disney 
has refused to pay processing costs at a jointly owned film 
processing lab 
disney immediately filed a 42 million countersuit alleging it 
had been fraudulently induced into entering into the metrocolor 
partnership disney claims it was prevented from selling its share 
of the lab 
the burbankbased entertainment giant also alleges that lorimar 
has refused to return to disney footage from its films beaches 
and turner and hooch and footage from movies made for disneys 
theme parks 
both lawsuits were filed in los angeles superior court 
lorimar maintains that disney and its subsidiaries are refusing 
to pay more than 8 million in film processing costs incurred at the 
los angeles metrocolor facility founded in 1987 
lorimars lawsuit alleges that early this year disney began to 
express displeasure that the metrocolor lab was not as profitable as 
disney had anticipated and disney began to press plaintiffs for 
concessions

unjustified burden on lorimar disney announced in june that it 
would no longer honor the partnership according to lorimars 
lawsuit 
lorimars court action seeks the 82 million disney allegedly 
owes for work done at metrocolor and an affiliated lab at least 18 
million in damages for breaches and misconduct and more than 100 
million in punitive damages

the belief that it could sell its stake but was unaware that 
certain restrictions prevented any sale until 1992 
disney says that a buyer the rank organization offered no less 
than 65 million for controlling interest in the lab last year

company had been led to believe it would be

ual corp directors reviewed california 
billionaire marvin daviss latest buyout offer thursday but said it 
was premature to make any decision on whether to sell the company 
the 16member board of united airlines parent company also 
confirmed speculation they had been contacted by other potential 
buyers and that their financial advisers had met with an employee 
group 
a company statement did not specify what employee group and ual 
spokeswoman sara dornacker refused to say if it was the pilots 
whose union has expressed interest in buying ual 
ms dornacker also would not say what other potential buyers 
other than davis have surfaced 
the board concluded that it was still premature to make a 
decision as to whether a sale of the company to any party was 
appropriate the board said in a statement after thursdays 
meeting 
the statement added that all possible financial and strategic 
alternatives should continue to be pursued 
on wednesday davis turned up the heat on the board by offering 
to ante up another 800 million raising his bid to 619 billion 
or 275 a share that total represented a 15 percent increase over 
davis original offer two weeks ago davis also said his offer could 
go higher after a review of the companys internal data 
after the meeting davis said in a statement that he and his 
associates are awaiting with interest the boards conclusions and 
continue to look forward to working with uals board management and 
labor groups to develop a transaction that works to the benefit of 
all parties concerned 
ual parent company of united airlines the nations 
secondlargest carrier has 225 million shares outstanding 
ual stock which had climbed a dizzying 90 per share in less 
than two weeks in anticipation of a bidding war for the company 
jumped 1462 a share to 26637 in consolidated new york stock 
exchange trading 
davis announcement wednesday sought to portray his offer as 
friendly apparently hoping to avoid alienating united pilots and 
other employee groups whose cooperation could prove crucial to any 
takeover attempt 
but davis did say if the bid was successful he intended to 
replace the 16 directors with five including himself his two 
sons john a davis and gregg j davis and james kneser a top 
davis aide 
he said he would retain ual chairman stephen wolf credited with 
helping turn the company around 
davis also filed a consent solicitation with united ensuring the 
company would not issue new stock to an employeeownership plan or 
another proxy that could be used to thwart a takeover 
davis apparently was not the only one trying to anticipate 
uniteds next move 
speculation in recent days suggested that wolf in conjunction 
with other ual executives may plan a bid for the company himself 
or recapitalization with employee ownership there also has been 
talk that buyout firms kohlberg kravis roberts amp co and 
forstmann little amp co have contacted ual about a possible deal 
the airlines pilots and machinists unions also have been 
mentioned as key players in any scenario for restructuring the 
company the united unit of the air line pilots association with 
7125 members made a bid for the company as recently as 1987 
all were aware of is that theres a board meeting we wont 
speculate whats going on but i will say our leadership is in 
constant touch with our financial and legal advisers said hank 
krakowski a spokesman for the pilots 
he said membership had not taken a position on a possible 
acquisition of the company by davis or any outsiders in general 
while declining to confirm reports about a scheduled meeting 
between the pilots the machinists and davis krakowski noted the 
letter sent by union officials to member pilots earlier this week 
which said concessions in exchange for equity was an option they 
may have to face
