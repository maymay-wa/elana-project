scheduled to die thursday morning after his attorneys lost similar 
appeals in three lower courts 
the emergency request by aubrey dennis adams jr was denied by 
the high court in a 72 vote the justices also turned down his 
formal appeal to review his death sentence 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall who oppose 
the death penalty in all circumstances voted to spare adams 
earlier wednesday the 11th us circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta denied a request for a stay of execution for adams saying 
it didnt find merit in any of the claims raised 
the 11th circuits decision wednesday night followed rejection 
of adams appeal by the florida supreme court in the morning and by 
us district judge john h moore ii in the afternoon 
the supreme court appeal was filed in anticipation of the lower 
court rejections said larry spalding head of the state agency 
that handles final appeals for inmates facing execution 
adams 31 a former officer at marion correctional institution 
in ocala was originally scheduled to die tuesday for the murder of 
an 8yearold marion county girl but the state supreme court 
issued a 48hour stay monday 
he is scheduled to die in the electric chair at florida state 
prison near starke at 7 am edt thursday 
if adams is put to death he will be the second man executed in 
the state this year and the 21st since florida resumed executions 
in 1979 in january ted bundy was executed for killing a lake city 
schoolgirl the last in a string a serial killings that started in 
the pacific northwest 
adams is under his fourth death warrant for the jan 23 1978 
murder of trisa gail thornley a thirdgrader last seen on her way 
home from school 
the girls mutilated and naked body was found in a plastic bag 
march 15 1978 by hunters in a remote area about three miles from 
her home 
an obscene phone call to the girls home was traced to adams 
home and he eventually admitted picking her up he said he recalls 
that she screamed at some point he placed his hand over her mouth 
to silence her and she suffocated 
adams and his wife a teachers aide were friends of the 
victims parents 
he had been scheduled to die in 1984 and twice in 1986 when 
three psychiatrists ruled him mentally competent to be executed 
state law requires that inmates be able to understand why they are 
being punished before they can be executed

the government on wednesday rejected student 
protesters demands that it recognize their new independent unions 
setting the stage for more prodemocracy demonstrations 
on tuesday student leaders gave the government 24 hours to 
recognize their student union or they would take to the streets 
again thousands demonstrated for democracy and freedom in shanghai 
the developments added new tension to a situation the government 
has been trying to calm by holding talks with officially sanctioned 
student unions 
last weeks activism crested with a march of 150000 students 
and their supporters in chinas capital 
the official student unions took no part in the marches the 
biggest in communist chinas history and student activists say the 
talks wont satisfy their yearnings for a freer and more open china 
beijing police announced they would close central beijings 
tiananmen square on thursday the 70th anniversary of chinas first 
student protests in what appeared to be an effort to head off a 
new student march 
the government also said unidentified nonstudents who oppose 
communist rule have been advising the student protesters from 
behind the scenes and suggested that leading dissident fang lizhi 
might be one of them 
government spokesman yuan mu told a news conference that these 
people try to accomplish during disturbances goals that they 
cannot attain in circumstances of political stability 
yuan stopped short of directly accusing fang an internationally 
renowned astrophysicist of advising the student protesters but he 
questioned fangs patriotism and said the role mr fang wants to 
play in the current disturbances will be decided by his words and 
deeds 
fang who previously has called marxism a failure and called for 
multiparty democracy has not taken part in any of the student 
protests that began april 15 speeches he made on campuses in 1986 
were blamed for stirring up 198687 prodemocracy marches and he 
was ousted from the party 
yuan refused to say what the government will do if students try 
to march thursday 
the protest in shanghai chinas most important trading and 
industrial city began in the early afternoon when about 6000 
students carrying banners reading give us democracy and 
freedom blocked traffic in front of city government offices 
student leaders presented petitions demanding political reform 
and the xinhua news agency said the protest ended about 10 pm 
an american teacher said a class boycott which started in 
beijing and spread earlier this week to tianjin has moved to 
shanghai about half of the students at fudan university the 
citys leading school are striking said jason hurtado of 
portland ore 
he quoted student activists at fudan as saying that student 
leaders from beijing helped organize the strike and the march 
student leaders have also been sent to beijing for more 
coordination he said earlier students from tianjin came to 
beijing for guidance with their movement 
in beijing 65 student leaders from 33 universities bicycled 
more than 7 miles to deliver an ultimatum to the national peoples 
congress chinas legislature the state council its cabinet and 
the central committee of the ruling communist party 
in a handwritten letter the students demanded the government 
recognize and hold talks with the united association of beijing 
universities an independent association set up during their 
2weekold campaign for democratic reform they want a free press 
freedom of assembly and publication and an end to official 
corruption 
thursday marks the 70th anniversary of chinas first student 
demonstration which turned into a movement for democratic and 
scientific reforms 
beijing students already have marched five times to tiananmen 
square since april 17 defying police warnings an estimated 70000 
students at 41 colleges in beijing also have been boycotting class 
since april 24 
after a march april 27 drew cheers and applause from tens of 
thousands of bystanders the government held a series of meetings 
with invited students 
however most of those invited have been members of the 
officially established student unions the government has declared 
the students new association illegal 
for its part the association has rejected the talks with the 
government as a sham accusing officials of trying to placate 
students without agreeing to democratic reforms 
despite student complaints however the government does seem to 
be responding to public pressure 
on saturday sunday and monday ministers of three government 
bureaus along with the governments leading spokesman and the mayor 
and party secretary of beijing met with students 
the meetings were unprecedented in a society whose leaders hide 
from public scrutiny 
the staterun press has softened its shrill editorial stance on 
the movement and several indepth reports on the talks and the 
demonstrations have appeared

behind the red door on makhoul street in west 
beirut theres a watering hole where the regulars huddle to share 
a drink seek shelter from the shelling and maybe sing along to a 
sinatra tune heres what the war clientele were up to on a 
recent night 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
hunched over a beer in the backstreet 
bar the only tavern in west beirut that has stayed open throughout 
the lebanon fighting a doctor was decribing the horrors of the 
casualty ward after recent ferocious shelling 
around the lebanese doctor a veteran of more bad nights than he 
can recall in lebanons relentless bloodletting the tavern was 
filled with about 40 people drinking from habib neaimehs 
wellstocked bar during a lull in the shelling 
neaimeh has kept his bar open six nights a week during the 
fighting 
when the shelling gets heavy i turn up the music he said 
standing behind his red and black bar on a recent night these 
people are not as relaxed as they try to appear theyre drinking 
more 
the doctor works at the american university hospital once one 
of the best medical centers in the middle east now after 14 years 
of civil war its short of medicine and trained staff it has 
taken several direct hits in recent fighting 
one night 15 people were brought in he said clutching his 
beer tightly four of them were dead 
there was a baby we thought its mother was among the dead and 
we didnt know what to do with it said the doctor 
suddenly this woman appears out of nowhere as one of our 
people is trying to soothe the baby turns out its the mother 
that story had a happy ending but for thousands of other 
lebanese the last seven weeks have brought only death injury 
devastation or confinement in bunkers and basements 
nearly 300 people have been killed and nearly 1000 wounded 
since march 8 in almost nonstop battles between army commander 
gen michel aouns mainly christian forces and an alliance of 
syrian troops and druse moslem militiamen 
neaimehs coterie of customers what he calls his war 
clientele regularly make it to the backstreet through the 
darkened alleys past packs of dogs scavenging through rotting 
ratinfested garbage to the red door in makhoul street 
shortages have forced neaimeh to trim his menu to cold cuts 
cheeses and grilled steaks 
his customers flung together by the war are a bizarre group of 
people who for their own reasons have hung on in the lebanese chaos 
and the kidnappings 
as more than 150000 people have fled the city amid the carnage 
in recent weeks the backstreet has become an oasis for this 
disparate group 
there are swiss from the red cross spanish and belgians from 
the frenchbased medecins sans frontiers agency a couple of 
russians the odd bulgarian or two and some lebanese 
neaimeh is a greek orthodox christian one of several thousand 
who live in the moslem sector most are leftists with little in 
common with the maronite catholics who make up the vast majority 
of the christians trapped in their enclave in east beirut and the 
mountains and coastal strip running north 
his only waiter is a sunni moslem the others refuse to leave 
their underground shelters to go to work and the cooks a shiite 
moslem 
despite their different religious preferences theyre a tight 
team a microcosm of whats possible in lebanon if the warring 
sects and factions could only get their act together 
this night at the bar everyones having a good time letting it 
all out but theres an undercurrent of apprehension the laughter 
sometimes has a brittle edge to it 
everyone knows someone whos been killed or wounded or lost a 
relative or whose home has been hit in the bombardments theyve 
all wondered whether the next rocket or shell to fall will have 
their name on it most are skeptical things will get better and 
many are trying to leave lebanon 
as the sound system belted out frank sinatra singing new york 
new york everyone joined in the line i want to wake up in a 
city that never sleeps enjoying the irony that the shelling 
makes sleep a luxury few get in beirut at that moment the bars 
generator sputtered and gave out 
about 11 pm rockets began to arc across beiruts dividing 
green line three miles of unrelieved devastation where christians 
and moslems have faced each other from sandbagged positions and 
gutter apartment buildings for 14 years 
incoming or outgoing a young woman asked as an explosion 
thundered nearby 
incoming i think i saw the flash a young man answered 
hesitantly 
anybody got a radio someone said whats it say 
a lebanese reporter working for a western news organization 
tuned his transistor radio to the christianrun voice of lebanon 
shells hitting the christian side the reporter said its 
outgoing 
thats ok then the young man replied 
then the radio said the source of the shelling had been 
pinpointed to west beirut the young man lost his poise told 
neaimeh hed pay his tab later and left 
he knew the christian army gunners were probably at that moment 
training their 155mm howitzers on the area around the backstreet 
bar to retaliate

despite severe economic problems iran is 
spending up to 5 billion a year to rebuild its military now that a 
ceasefire has been reached in the 8yearold war with iraq 
analysts report 
irans relations with moscow also are warming and the 
fundamentalist moslem regime is turning to the soviet bloc 
increasingly for arms apparently paying for tanks artillery and 
other weapons with crude oil 
on monday deputy foreign minister ali mohammad besharati said 
iran soon would buy weapons from the soviet union and was 
negotiating with countries he did not identify for advanced fighter 
bombers 
iran must broaden its source of arms he said because if we 
depend on one particular country or bloc then they take advantage 
of the situation they want to impose their own ideology on 
us 
besharati did not say what kind of soviet weapons iran would buy 
or what the cost would be 
strengthening the islamic republics defense capabilities is 
one of the major tasks we face during the reconstruction period 
president ali khamenei told senior military commanders at a recent 
conference 
both belligerents have large forces along the ceasefire line 
and with peace talks deadlocked eight months after they began 
irans rapid buildup is causing concern among western officials 
its very worrisome theyre rebuilding much faster than we 
expected a senior official of the us defense department told 
the associated press on condition of anonymity 
iraq also is seeking new weapons to modernize its armed forces 
and both countries have been developing their own arms industries 
including missile production since the ceasefire aug 20 
earlier this month the tehran daily payam eenqelab said the 
missile firepower of the revolutionary guards corps will increase 
fivefold in the near future using domestically produced weapons 
with ranges of up to 100 miles 
the american source said of the iranian rearmament program it 
appears theyre talking in the range of 20 billion over the next 
45 years theyve got serious economic problems and yet theyre 
spending this kind of money on rebuilding their military the 
question is to what end 
us and other western officials said irans major arms 
suppliers in the latter stages of the gulf war china and north 
korea still are its main sources 
diplomatic sources in the persian gulf region reported recently 
that the chinese are helping iran build a plant to produce 
surfacetosurface missiles 
alittihad a daily in abu dhabi quoted military sources last 
month as saying china would provide 40 new silkworm antiship 
missiles a reconnaissance satellite and batteries of hq2j 
surfacetoair missiles the chinese version of the soviet sam2 
evidence increases however that iran also is turning to 
eastern europe for sovietdesigned weapons us sources said most 
of the equipment is tanks trucks artillery and small arms rather 
than hightechnology weapons 
gulf newspapers have said romania would supply nearly 500 tanks 
armored vehicles and tank transporters help build a naval base on 
qeshm island in the strait of hormuz and convert a tractor factory 
in arak to produce armored vehicles 
czechoslovakia will supply iran with 180 t54 and t55 tanks and 
help build a plant to make antitank weapons the papers have 
reported 
no independent confirmation of the reports was available but 
iran has made trade agreements with several soviet bloc states 
including romania czechoslovakia and east germany providing for 
payment in crude oil 
it has a similar pact with brazil now the worlds sixth largest 
arms exporter 
irans official media monitored in nicosia said only that the 
deals involve products and services but analysts believe arms 
are involved 
the east bloc will be swimming with t54s and t55s because of 
eastwest force reductions and it makes a lot of sense that iran 
would be getting a lot of hardware from this quarter said 
hansheino kopietz a middle east specialist with the international 
institute for strategic studies in london 
in the us sources view arms deals with the soviet bloc 
have obvious advantages including allland transportation 
through russia irans northern neighbor 
tehran also has strengthened military links with its eastern 
neighbor pakistan a moslem nation the pakistanis are developing 
their own arms industry and are advanced in the production of 
missiles and some other hightech weapons 
both brig gen mansour sattari the air force commander and 
ali shamkhani the revolutionary guards corps minister visited 
islamabad in recent weeks to meet with senior pakistani military 
officials 
well soon see the fruits of these talks which have defense 
and other objectives shamkhani said without elaboration 
official iranian media have reported a defense allocation 
equivalent to 585 billion in this years budget described as 
about half last years total 
reselat a tehran daily said parliament also approved a secret 
budget bill in which defense spending was considerably higher 
exiled opponents of the regime claimed to have a copy of the 
secret budget they said it included 49 billion for the defense 
ministry and 36 billion for revolutionary guards 
the mujahedeen khalq based in iraq also told the associated 
press those figures did not represent irans entire planned 
military spending 
analysts have estimated that on the basis of such needs as 
combat jets tanks radars and missiles iran would spend about 5 
billion a year on new weapons

the palestinian uprising has produced a new 
game that has israelis battling stonethrowing palestinians on 
computer screens and getting burned either by firebombs or world 
public opinion 
computer buff shahar melamed said the game is being passed 
around by computer enthusiasts and is popular among children in 
rehovot a town near tel aviv housing israels prestigious weizman 
institute of science 
melamed is a photo editor at the israeli daily yediot ahronot 
which printed a story on the game tuesday 
he said the program was signed only by mike and added 
some details of the program indicate it was done in the united 
states i dont know who wrote the program but he seems to be a 
very good programmer 
the game is titled the intefadeh the arabic word for 
uprising that is commonly used for the nearly 17month revolt 
against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
palestinian children have made up their own street game on the 
uprising in which they take turns playing soldiers and 
stonethrowers shoot with plastic guns and even hold mock funerals 
for martyrs 
the intefadeh is much more sophisticated with players 
getting points for inflicting casualties but only with specific 
weapons allowed by changing rules 
these mirror real life since israeli soldiers face a complex 
set of regulations on using tear gas rubber or plastic bullets and 
live ammunition in putting down riots in the occupied lands 
the game has political implications players gain points for 
helping to elect rightwing politicans players can lose points for 
upsetting world public opinion again reflecting reality israel 
has drawn international criticism over the more than 450 
palestinian deaths in the revolt 
one set of instructions for the game begins 
you can use the wooden club you were issued on any rioter use 
tear gas any time you feel it is needed you are authorized to 
shoot any rioter with rubber bullets shoot rubber or plastic 
bullets at any rioter who throws molotov cocktail you are not 
allowed to use live ammunition under any circumstances 
the screen then shows a typical street in a palestinian village 
or town with a lone israeli soldier facing protesters the trooper 
is pelted with rocks and firebombs and may respond with gunfire or 
chase the protesters along narrow streets 
but the rules can change according to who is the defense 
minister in charge randomly chosen by the computer and listed at 
the top of the screen 
under moshe arens israels reallife foreign minister live 
ammunition cannot be used but under ariel sharon a hawk forced 
to resign as defense minister in 1983 during israels invasion of 
lebanon live ammunition is a must 
points are scored by inflicting as many casualties as possible 
within a given time limit by using proper ammunition 
an injured soldier is evacuated by an ambulance or bursts into 
flames and is declared dead the computer labels him just another 
victim of arab terrorism 
palestinians injured by tear gas move in dizzy circles but 
intensify stonethrowing attacks later 
at the end of the game an israeli defense forces evaluation 
form is displayed on the screen featuring the number of 
protesters injured killed or captured a successful player is 
congratulated for helping israeli rightwingers win the national 
elections 
the game is made even more complex however by the presence of 
the public opinion index indiscriminate shooting of protesters 
can lead to a chilling judgment on the screen one example 
performance you have gone wild public opinion index zero 
your inefficiency in supressing the violence is appalling you must 
be sleeping on the job the government lost the elections mostly as 
a result of your inaction

sirisiar bridge on the indiannepalese border ap a friendly 
sort of friction has set in at this crossing point between india 
the political and military giant of south asia and nepal a tiny 
and landlocked kingdom 
for more than a month nepal has been defying and exasperating 
india by refusing to renegotiate trade agreements on indias terms 
as a result india has imposed a partial blockade and nepal is 
suffering severe shortages of fuel needed to operate motor 
vehicles provide electrical power and cook food 
medicines baby food and other essential goods also are in short 
supply 
the problem is as tangled as the traffic jam of bullock carts 
horsedrawn carriages and bicyclepowered rickshaws trying to 
negotiate the narrow wooden bridge over the sirisiar river without 
getting stuck in the cracks between the creaking planks 
the bullocks long pointed horns scrape and snag on the 
rickshaws cloth canopies much as the government officials in new 
delhi and katmandu are scraping and snagging in the political 
impasse 
india population 880 million perceives nepal as an ungrateful 
neighbor seeking preferential treatment for itself while refusing 
to grant india reciprocal privileges 
nepal population 17 million sees india as a bit of a bully 
trying to thwart nepalese efforts to diversify its trading partners 
officially speaking the indian blockade is not total 
practically speaking its effects come close to being total 
this is not a blockade you can see the trucks are moving 
customs collector asit mitra said in the indian border town of 
raxaul as a score of vehicles lumbered over the bridge to nepal 
hauling burlap bags of salt cases of baby formula and brand new 
but empty tanks for cooking gas 
the goods are coming in but not as they were said mayor 
vimal srivastav three miles up the road in the nepalese town of 
birganj 
at the birganj customs yard the goods are unloaded from indian 
trucks but the porters are sleeping in the midday heat atop the 
cartons they normally would be transferring to nepalese trucks 
the diesel and gasoline to run the trucks 75 miles north to 
katmandu the nepalese capital no longer arrive from india itself 
a net importer of petroleum products 
its like you get the torch flashlight but not the 
battery said pashupati shaha a hotel owner in birganj 
when the bilateral trade and transit treaties expired march 23 
with no replacements in the offing india closed 13 of the 15 
official crossing points on the 1095mile border only raxaul and 
jogbani remain open 
nepal wanted to renegotiate the two treaties separately one 
governing trade with india the other covering vital transit rights 
from calcutta to the border for nonindian imports india sought a 
single treaty to safeguard its own trade with nepal 
nepal has little to offer foreign trading partners apart from 
goatskins and a few spices but it imports machinery housewares 
textiles and food in addition to pharmaceutical and petroleum 
products 
for the last two years about 40 percent of nepals imports were 
indian fifteen years ago more than 80 percent were indian 
especially of concern to india are recent nepalese efforts to 
expand trade with china indias longtime regional rival and the 
only other country with direct land access to nepal 
indias pique heightened last fall when nepal purchased 
antiaircraft guns and other weapons from china prompting two 
questions in new delhi why was nepal making purchases from china 
and why did the tiny himalayan monarchy which has about 35000 men 
under arms compared to indias 14 million need antiaircraft 
guns anyway 
nepal considers its trade and defense needs its own business 
trade has its own nature foreign minister shailendra kumar 
upadhyaya told a reporter in katmandu this week trade will 
increase normally with any country with which we receive a fair 
deal 
one more nettle is nepals decision requiring the 150000 
indians in nepal to obtain work permits while india has made no 
similar requirements of the estimated 5 million nepalese in india 
in addition birganj had long been a shoppers delight for 
indians whose own country prides itself on selfsufficiency and 
imports little of the western and japanese goods widely available 
in nepal 
the nepalese joke about their ability to sell just about 
anything with a foreign label to indian visitors 
shaha the birganj hotel owner remarked you can blame nepal 
for this the indians can find some of these things cheaper in 
calcutta and madras but they want to come to nepal and buy some 
merchants import saris from india stamp made in japan on them 
and the indians are very happy to buy 
the nepalese will buy seven or eight times what they need of 
something import it through calcutta then smuggle it back across 
the border to sell it in india an indian government official 
said speaking on condition of anonymity

the surprise declaration by sudanese rebels 
of a monthlong ceasefire reprieves the khartoum governments 
beleaguered troops and boosts an international effort to save 
100000 people facing starvation 
it also raises hopes for an end to six years of civil war that 
drains 1 million a day from the coffers of one of the worlds 
poorest countries 
mondays announcement by john garang leader of the sudan 
peoples liberation army comes at the height of his greatest 
success of the war a sixmonth string of victories that has 
government forces reeling 
rebel fighters also have been intensifying pressure on the 
strategic southern capital juba its fall could have determined 
the wars outcome by forcing the government from its largest 
stronghold in the embattled south 
but at least as important the ceasefire could boost the united 
nations struggling operation to transport more than 100000 tons 
of food and supplies to the south before heavy rains start this 
month 
last year relief officials say up to 500000 southerners died 
in the fighting or from warinduced disease and famine in villages 
isolated by flooded roads and airstrips 
garang a useducated renegade army colonel said the 
unilateral truce will hold only so long as the government refrains 
from redeploying or reinforcing its troops he said it could be 
extended 
prime minister sadek mahdi welcomed the move each step taken 
by garang toward peace will be reciprocated by two steps from the 
government he said in a may day speech 
only last month garang rejected a unproposed month of 
tranquillity to allow the 132 million relief operation easy 
access to 23 million waraffected southerners 
instead he guaranteed safe conduct for specific relief convoys 
but attacks by unidentified armed groups bureaucratic hassles 
inadequate transport infrastructure and bad planning have hampered 
the operation only 37000 tons of food was delivered in april 
un officials say they will continue until the rains cut 
transport routes 
i think the overriding reasons behind this decision are 
political but they are bound to be connected with the relief 
effort said richard reid the regional director of unicef who 
conducts most un negotiations with the rebels 
were keeping our fingers crossed but it ought to help the 
operation if only by easing things and reducing the level of 
anxiety reid said in a telephone interview from amman jordan 
military experts in khartoum interpreted the rebels rejection 
of the original truce as evidence of unwillingness to impede their 
battlefield winning streak 
since then mahdi has come under army pressure and approved a 
tentative peace plan which the rebels welcomed with cautious 
optimism 
the ceasefire was the next logical step in the peace 
process said peter woodward a lecturer at englands reading 
university and a specialist on sudan who returned from khartoum 
last week 
now its up to the government to arrange for further steps 
woodward said in a telephone interview 
garangs broadcast said all his forces will remain in their 
positions to wait for the government to implement the 
requirements of the sudanese peace initiative 
a joint technical military committee then would work out a 
comprehensive ceasefire he said 
the agreements most politically sensitive clause calls for the 
suspension of harsh islamic laws in force since late 1983 the 
mainly animist and christian rebels took up arms against the 
moslemdominated government a few months earlier demanding 
autonomy for the south 
mahdi the leader of a sudanese moslem sect approved the 
suspension last month leaving the way clear for a constitutional 
conference 
in the two years that the rebels have won an upper hand in the 
war southern civilians have suffered as both sides used food as a 
weapon 
juba a city of dusty streets and thatchedroof mud huts whose 
population is swollen by refugees to five times its normal 30000 
has been besieged for more than two years rebels intensified their 
attacks these past few months 
the splas military successes created a very difficult 
political situation for them said woodward if they took over 
the major towns in the south it would mean a de facto 
separation of sudan and it would be much more difficult to try and 
negotiate a peaceful settlement for a united sudan now they 
negotiate from a position of strength 
military sources in khartoum say about 20000 troops are holed 
up in the middle of juba 
one source estimated the armys strength at 75000 and the 
rebels at 57000 but government troops are outnumbered in the war 
because only 10000 soldiers remain in major southern towns other 
than juba

when mayor tom bradley won a fifth term three 
weeks ago it should have been a time of celebration for the 
71yearold sharecroppers son instead he found himself facing 
whats become the political crisis of his career 
after 16 years of an administration free of personal scandal 
the usually bland and steady bradley is the subject of a 
conflictofinterest probe for accepting thousands of dollars in 
consulting fees from banks that did business with the city 
he says he was unaware of the business ties when he accepted the 
money 
bradley also is under fire because his daughter was employed by 
a project to which he helped funnel nearly 400000 of city money 
the task force for africalos angeles relations he said he was 
unaware she had been hired 
the allegations which began surfacing at the end of the 
campaign have tarnished the niceguy image of bradley a former 
police lieutenant dubbed the teflon mayor for his ability to escape 
blame for the citys gang growth and pollution problems 
other mayors have had bigger problems political allies of new 
yorks ed koch have committed suicide or gone to prison san 
antonios henry cisneros admitted a close personal relationship 
with a woman not his wife detroits coleman young has been slapped 
with a paternity suit by a former city employee 
but for bradley probably the blandest of bigcity mayors its 
a major embarrassment 
for politically dull los angeles its a rare taste of a scandal 
at the very top 
bradley has scrambled to defuse the controversy by placing his 
investments which range from an estimated 101000 to 1 million 
in a blind trust 
he has established an ethics panel which announced monday it 
wont investigate bradley and will instead rewrite the city ethics 
code to restore public trust in city government 
bradley also has retained lawyers from manatt phelps 
rothenberg and phillips a law firm of democratic political 
insiders that is handling the ethics defense of house speaker jim 
wright 
he is refusing comment until a city investigation is completed 
but allegations surface daily 
on tuesday the herald examiner reported that far east national 
bank was allowed to hold 600000 in city money for three months in 
1987 without paying interest it said the account was set up by 
bradley two months after the situation was discovered bradley 
started earning 18000 a year as a consultant to the bank he has 
since returned the money saying he was unaware far east had 
business ties with the city 
bradley the citys first black mayor won a fifth term april 
11 barely escaping a runoff with challenger nate holden and 
drawing the lowest turnout in decades 
unquestionably the issues that have been raised over the 
course of the last three weeks have raised some doubts in the minds 
of some people bradley said 
supporters predict however he will survive the controversy 
hes a superquality guy he has never done anything the least 
bit questionable on anything said richard riordan president of 
the los angeles coliseum commission and a republican who supports 
the democratic bradley 
hes so perfect that people want to knock him off his hill and 
find his imperfections he added 
holden who made headlines by buying back semiautomatic weapons 
from the public said i think the quicker we get to the bottom 
of this matter the better everythings going to be business at 
city hall is stopped its at a standstill 
in addition to examining bradleys relationships with far east 
and the african task force investigators are focusing on valley 
federal savings amp loan association bradley was paid at least 
71000 to serve on its board while it did business with the city 
he resigned the post the day after his election

educators hope a new program will make a 
middle school a model for race relations and improved academics 
the restructured school to be called the prospect middle 
school center for multiracial multicultural and multiethnic 
education is to offer programs to encourage students to respect 
other races and teach staff members how to instruct students of 
other races officials said tuesday 
perhaps it will improve race relations throughout the entire 
city said principal robert pipkin 
it will be the model where we develop programs policies and 
practices for districtwide use pittsburgh school district 
spokeswoman pat crawford said 
ms crawford said no new students or staff members would be 
added to the present prospect middle school in the citys mount 
washington neighborhood she said the new programs are to begin 
next fall 
school superintendent richard c wallace said the idea came from 
principals and consultants who studied city schools last fall 
he said concerns about racism stemmed from occasional fights in 
schools and the disproportionate number of black students who are 
suspended or referred to special education classes 
i wouldnt say its at this point a serious problem a crisis 
situation but we dont want it to get to that level wallace 
said 
of about 39600 public school students in pittsburgh 52 percent 
are black and 48 percent are white officials said

the old chinese habit of shunning banks has 
caused an 82yearold farmer to lose most of his life savings to 
mildew an official newspaper reported today 
when zhang dexiang who had buried his life savings of about 
1200 in his courtyard five years ago dug up the money recently 
he discovered it was moldy almost beyond recognition the china 
daily reported 
the farmer in northeastern liaoning province was only able to 
salvage 400 which he exchanged for new bills at a local bank it 
said 
china which has a surplus of cash in its overheated economy is 
suffering from a shortage of funds for investment because many 
people fearing runaway inflation traditionally refuse to put 
their money in the bank 
personal caches like zhangs account for an estimated 133 
billion 
the interest rate on oneyear deposits was raised last year from 
72 percent to 864 percent but fails to keep pace with 36 percent 
inflation

some of the states poor opened their monthly 
benefit checks this week and got a surprise an extra check 
but they cant cash in on the windfall because the extra checks 
belong to another recipient of the aid to families with dependent 
children program the program sends out 23000 checks totaling 45 
million a month 
the problem likely was caused by a mailsorting machine at a 
company that has the contract for sorting mail and stuffing 
envelopes for the program said kenny whitlock who directs the 
department of human services division that administers the program 
if the suction cups of the mailsorting machine come down on 
computer holes on the checks the suction picks up not only the 
intended check but also the one behind it whitlock said 
the problem has surfaced in at least six counties but may be 
more widespread said whitlock

student protests from massachusetts to california took aim 
tuesday at proposed budget cuts tuition increases and union 
recognition and student pressure at a prestigious college led to a 
ban on cocacola products 
in new york thousands of protesting city university students 
skipped classes and marched through lower manhattan as a deadline 
approached on a state spending bill that would reduce money for 
higher education and force a tuition increase hours later gov 
mario cuomo vetoed the tuition hike 
in south hadley mass mount holyoke college administrators 
under pressure from students to boycott cocacola products because 
of the companys ties to south africa announced a monthlong ban of 
the companys soft drinks 
in the central massachusetts town of granby nearly 400 students 
walked out of high school and into a heavy rain to protest budget 
cuts the principal says could cost the school at least three 
teachers and several programs 
in atlanta students and others who met to discuss a decision to 
ban a rap music concert friday at morris brown college were 
released without bond tuesday after a hearing on felony trespassing 
charges 
twentyseven people including students from several atlanta 
university center colleges and some nonstudents were arrested 
monday for refusing to leave a student center said cynthia bell a 
morris brown college spokeswoman 
at the university of california at berkeley teaching and 
research assistants on wednesday were to begin a twoday walkout 
and picket the four major campus entrances to protest the schools 
refusal to recognize their union 
in new york about 4000 students stepped up protests that began 
last week 
placardcarrying chanting students from the university system 
assembled in front of the world trade center where cuomos new 
york office is located they blocked traffic for several hours 
then paraded through the streets past city hall to the wall street 
financial district 
its not just a matter of this tuition hike if we let them 
go it will be more said armando howard a 29yearold physics 
student at hunter college it will cut out the opportunity for 
people to rise 
cuomo who had until midnight to sign or veto the tuition 
increase measure had given no indication what his decision would 
be but one hour before the deadline it was announced he had 
vetoed the legislation saying university officials hadnt proven 
the need for the extra money 
at mount holyoke officials outlined immediate steps to replace 
coke usa products with beverages from companies with little or no 
business interest in south africa the announcement came in a 
onepage release that gave no explanation for the move 
students at mount holyoke and several other colleges in western 
massachusetts have pressed administrators for two months to remove 
cocacola products because they say the company is reaping 
profits that benefit racially segregated south africa 
i think its a monumental step i think it shows some 
responsibility on the part of the adminstration in terms of 
listening to students said kuhusu wanzu a member of the coke 
campaign at the american friends service committee in atlanta 
which organized the campus boycotts 
in granby students who comprise virtually the entire population 
of the little school stood for 45 minutes in heavy rain before 
returning to class said principal john cullinan 
the students felt this was the only way they could get their 
message across in a way that people would notice the principal 
of the granby juniorsenior high said 
at berkeley neither the 3200member association of graduate 
student employees nor university officials would predict how many 
assistants would join the walkout 
so far our indications are that this could be more symbolic 
than a significant disruption said university spokesman tom 
debley 
the dispute is over the universitys view that the assistants 
work cannot be considered employment because it is so intertwined 
with educational experience said debley assistants receive annual 
stipends from the university or research institutions averaging 
about 10000 
the association has been seeking recognition since 1983 as a 
union but the public employement relations board recently ruled 
students do not have to be considered employees for the purposes of 
collective bargaining the association is appealing the decision

say byebye to bill the cat the drugaddled 
feline whos smooched jeane kirkpatrick and swapped brains with 
donald trump bill and the other residents of bloom county are 
soon to be history the latest victims of funnypage flameout 
cartoonist berke breathed pulled the plug on the pulitzer 
prizewinning bloom county earlier this week becoming the 
third comicpage fixture to leave fans hanging in recent years 
but while garry trudeau and gary larson put their characters on 
vacation when cartooning became a grind breathed opted to off his 
a good comic strip is no more eternal than a ripe melon the 
ugly truth is that in most cases comics age less gracefully than 
their creators bloom county is retiring before the stretch marks 
show breathed said in explaining his decision 
readers of nearly 800 newspapers now will learn to live without 
bigbeaked penguin opus his buddy milo and motley party animal 
bill the cat no longer will their lives intersect those of 
kirkpatrick trump or lee iacocca three public figures frequently 
skewered by breathed 
but such bad news is becoming all too common for the discerning 
comic reader who in the recent years has lost larsons the far 
side and trudeaus doonesbury for extended periods while 
their creators escaped the daytoday drudgery 
i need a breather investigative cartooning is a young mans 
game said trudeau in announcing his hiatus from january 1983 to 
september 1984 a move that was questioned by veteran cartoonists 
such as milton caniff of steve canyon 
another guy is waiting in the wings and once youre out you 
often cant get back in the space is filled said caniff who 
has since died 
similarly larsons syndicate editor lee salem explained the 
cartoonist felt he needed to get away from the deadline situation 
for a while so he could try to regenerate his cells the far 
side is due back in 1990 
while trudeau and larson took breathers to escape burnout 
breathed will resume his career with an entirely new sundaysonly 
strip 
others in the business say they understand his decision penning 
a daily strip is anything but a million laughs for its creator 
its like pedaling a bicycle above a rotating blade knowing 
that if you stop youll fall and get cut up said peanuts 
cartoonist charles schulz whose strip is in its fourth decade 
you cant plan like a novelist where you have three or four 
years to work said schulz a cartoonist doesnt have time to 
stop its go go go continuously 
breatheds strip says sayonara aug 6 although there is hope 
that one resident of bloom county nobodys saying which one 
may survive its doomsday 
the cartoonists new characters will not resemble the old ones 
with maybe one exception said william dickinson general 
manager and editorial director of the washington post writers 
group which syndicates the strip

nevadans voted 31 tuesday to approve a 
52 million mining tax hike but balloting was close on a plan to 
double the money nevada can borrow for new state construction 
with 25 percent of 609 precincts counted the mining tax 
proposal was favored 266927966 the vote on the construction 
measure was 18363 for and 17051 against 
election officials around the state predicted low voter 
turnouts ranging from 30 to 40 percent of the more than 383000 
people eligible to vote 
its nothing great but its steady carson city 
clerkrecorder alan glover said of early voter turnout which he 
estimated at about 30 percent 
recent polls indicated the mining tax would win approval gov 
bob miller and key lawmakers warned that without approval of the 
plan the state would face fiscal chaos 
had the measure lost officials said the legislature would be 
in session an extra month slashing budgets and raising taxes to 
make up for the loss of the anticipated mining tax revenues 
expected to be 52 million over a twoyear period 
the law would allow the state to impose a 5 percent tax on the 
net proceeds of mines the ballot question was the result of an 
agreement struck during the 1987 legislature between the mining 
industry lawmakers and thengov dick bryan 
the other question on the ballot would double the money nevada 
can borrow for new state construction the governors proposed 
budget includes money generated by state bond sales for new prison 
and university construction projects 
officials have argued that without doubling the constitutional 
limit on bond debt to 2 percent of the assessed value of all 
taxable land nevada will have to pay cash for such projects 
but opponents argue that while nevada needs the bond money 
lawmakers who wrote supporting and opposing arguments for the 
proposal intentionally neglected to mention that the state must 
repay new bond sales through higher property taxes

thousands of dead birds snared in a giant 
glob of sticky oil line a beach 300 miles southwest of valdez 
victims of the spreading crude that has devastated alaskas coast 
for weeks 
while enviromentalists government and exxon officials trade 
barbs over blame the oil drifts inexorably fouling the shoreline 
and leaving dead dying or dirtied birds fish otters seals and 
sea lions even alaskas lumbering powerful brown bears have been 
seen prowling on oilcaked beaches 
the oil is selective it leapfrogs large stretches of coast 
then hits others with contamination ranging from a light film to 
ankledeep goo 
we landed along a wide tidal basin about six miles of 
beach said ray bane superintendent of katmai national park 
we found oil debris in large quantities throughout the tidal 
zone we saw 2000 to 3000 dead birds you cant really tell 
what they are theyre one big blob of oil 
since march 24 when the tanker exxon valdez smashed into bligh 
reef in prince william sound and leaked 101 million gallons of 
crude through its shattered hull the reports of destroyed wildlife 
have multiplied steadily 
the spill has reached chignik 525 miles southwest of valdez

the countdown advanced smoothly 
today toward thursdays scheduled launch of atlantis with five 
astronauts and a robot probe to venus 
this time were going to see if we can get it right 
astronaut david walker who will command the flight said tuesday 
four days earlier a launch attempt was called off just 31 seconds 
before the planned liftoff 
looks like the vehicles been turned around real well 
walker told reporters were extremely pleased the folks here at 
the cape were able to do such a good and quick job getting it ready 
to go again 
the other crew members are pilot ronald grabe and mission 
specialists mary cleave mark lee and norman thagard 
liftoff is scheduled for 148 pm thursday 
there are no major issues in sight robert crippen nasas 
deputy director of operations said after a mission management 
meeting tuesday were pressing on 
shuttle weather forecasters said there was a 70 percent chance 
conditions would be favorable the only concern was a threat of 
crosswinds greater than 17 mph that could be dangerous if the 
shuttle had to make an emergency landing on a runway near the 
launch pad 
atlantis will carry into space the 550 million magellan probe 
which the astronauts are to dispatch on a 15month journey to 
venus the probe is to orbit the planet and map its cloudshrouded 
surface with a high resolution radar system 
the launch attempt was halted on friday because of a short 
circuit in a fuel pump 
technicians working around the clock replaced the pump and a 
suspect fuel line in half the time expected 
engineers thought there was a leak in the fuel line but tests 
turned up nothing they believe a vapor cloud seen spewing from the 
line thought to be gas might have been trapped air 
ronald phelps a shuttle test director said the new countdown 
which started tuesday was compressed from three days to two by 
eliminating some hold time that is built into the countdown in 
case of problems and by not repeating some tasks completed in the 
first attempt

japan has closed down for its annual weeklong 
series of spring holidays including one created by the government 
this year just to encourage the industrious workforce to let its 
reputation slide a bit 
for many the annual golden week started friday giving them 
the rare opportunity to take up to nine days off in a row for 
others time off began today the first of three consecutive 
official national holidays 
april 29 which fell on friday has been a holiday for more than 
60 years marking the birthday of the late emperor hirohito after 
his death jan 7 its name was changed to greenery day 
constitution day falls on may 3 and childrens day on may 5 
this year the government has made may 4 a national holiday also 
to encourage more people to take consecutive days off 
its different from foreign countries japanese generally 
cant take several days of vacation at one time said reiko 
tomizawa of the japan travel bureau the countrys largest travel 
agency 
people even used to work every other day during golden week 
until the government made may 4 a holiday this year ms tomizawa 
said its just the national character of the japanese to work 
hard without vacations 
but government officials believe the japanese should devote more 
time to leisure activities and spend more money on both them and 
imports in order to reduce the nations huge trade surplus 
earlier this year the government instituted a shortened 
fiveday work week every other week for government employees it is 
enouraging private business to follow suit 
a record 177 million japanese or 147 percent of the 
population are gong on trips of more than one night this week and 
an alltime high of 365000 are taking advantage of the high value 
of the yen to go overseas according to a survey by the japan 
travel bureau 
the most popular family destinations this year are hawaii guam 
and hong kong the bureau said 
young single office ladies are turning toward canada and 
europe the agency said they usually save money by living at their 
parents home and they have a reputation for being big holiday 
spenders 
japanese are spending an average 2107 on travel abroad up 87 
percent and 394 up 89 percent for domestic travel according 
to the agencys study 
many workers however see golden week as a time to lounge 
around at home and avoid the jammed highways hot springs and 
mountain resorts 
its too crowded and expensive to do anything said katsuya 
hirai 33 who works in the sales department of a japanese 
automaker and its before our june bonus so i dont have any 
money right now 
i can afford to take the family for a day trip to a safari 
park near mount fuji he says but my wife says she wants to 
eat out every night 
hotels across southeast asia report room shortages during the 
week because of the japanese influx especially in popular 
destinations such as thailand hong kong and even singapore until 
recently suffering from a hotel glut 
to make matters worse some hotels in southeast asia are 
becoming disenchanted with tour groups the mode of travel 
particularly favored by the japanese said the nihon keizai 
shimbun japans main economic newspaper 
they are starting to focus on individual guests where the 
profit margins are higher and the noise level is lower

senate investigators say theyve discovered at 
least two silenceformoney deals between builders of a texas 
nuclear power plant and workers who received payments in return for 
dropping allegations of safety hazards 
the senate subcommittee on nuclear regulation said tuesday it is 
widening its investigation to determine the frequency and legality 
of these secret deals 
its beginning to look like something thats throughout the 
industry said bob mann an aide to sen john breaux dla the 
subcommittee chairman 
the nuclear regulatory commission which licenses commercial 
nuclear power stations and enforces safety rules has not commented 
publicly on the acceptability of agreements that limit a plant 
workers ability to raise safety issues 
in private notices to all nuclear plant operators and vendors 
however the commission last week said such restrictions were not 
acceptable under any circumstances it asked the companies to 
notify the nrc of any such deals by july 31 
it is not acceptable to include in settlement agreements for 
discrimination matters or in any labor agreements or other 
agreement any restrictions on employees or former employees 
providing information to any members of the nrc said the notice 
a copy was obtained by the associated press 
frank ingram a commission spokesman said the letters were sent 
in response to concerns raised by one of the texas nuclear plant 
deals cited by breauxs panel 
breaux said such agreements hold frightening implications for 
nuclear safety 
it turns the licensing process into a sham if witnesses can be 
paid money to withhold their testimony he said 
the panel has scheduled a hearing thursday to hear from parties 
to one of the texas agreements and from nrc chairman lando w zech 
jr who was not involved in the deals breaux has blasted zech and 
other nrc commissioners for not publicly condemning the agreements 
subcommittee sources speaking on condition they not be 
identified further said documents indicated joseph j macktal a 
former electrical foreman at the comanche peak nuclear station 
received 35000 for himself and his attorneys in a january 1987 
agreement with the plants builder brown amp root they said the 
deal barred macktal from testifying to the nrc regarding his 
concerns about plant safety 
macktal contends in a new complaint with the labor department 
that he signed the deal under duress 
brown amp root in a statement from its houston headquarters said 
the payment to macktal and his attorneys was in settlement of an 
earlier complaint he made to the labor department that he was 
forced to quit because he had questioned brown amp roots quality 
controls at comanche peak 
the payment was meant to limit litigation costs the company 
said 
the company acknowledged that the deal prevents macktal from 
appearing as a witness before the nrc but it said the intent of 
this provision was to protect the company from the need to defend 
against his labor department complaint in another forum 
it said macktal had ample opportunity to provide any safety 
information to the nrc prior to signing the deal 
the first of two reactors at comanche peak is 99 percent 
complete and its owner texas utilities generating co is expected 
to apply for a lowpower license next year the other reactor at 
the site near glen rose is 85 percent complete 
breaux a louisiana democrat said the macktal agreement came to 
light after the nrcs atomic safety and licensing board had ended 
its comanche peak hearings last july 
subcommittee sources said the panel has documented another case 
at comanche peak in which a worker who had raised safety concerns 
received 30000 as part of a deal with gibbs amp hill inc a 
contractor at the plant site they said the arrangement prohibits 
the employee lorenzo polizzi from testifying before the nrc about 
safety issues 
at gibbs amp hill headquarters in new york spokeswoman debra fay 
said she was not familiar with the case and no company official was 
immediately available to comment 
the subcommittee also is investigating a contractorworker 
agreement involving the millstone nuclear power station at 
waterford conn the sources said no details were provided

thousands of public water systems across the 
country will have to improve their purification equipment to reduce 
chemical contamination and comply with new environmental protection 
agency standards 
the epa on tuesday proposed federally required ceilings on the 
maximum amounts of 38 types of cancercausing chemicals and other 
pollutants allowed in drinking water 
michael cook director of the epa office which deals with 
drinking water contaminants said most public water systems already 
meet the proposed requirements but additional purification 
equipment will probably be needed in about 2500 public systems 
serving about 2 million people mostly in rural areas 
in some cases households will be paying higher water bills 
anywhere from 10 to 460 more a year as a result officials 
said although the new requirements in many cases are unlikely to 
go into effect until 1991 
epa said the size of consumer cost increases will depend on the 
size of the water system and the contaminant and treatment 
technology involved 
affected systems account for about 3 percent of all the public 
water systems in the country according to the epa private well 
water is not covered by the regulations 
in addition officials operating about 80000 water systems 
likely will have to increase monitoring activities to comply with 
the new rules 
the new regulations require that local water officials regularly 
monitor the level of pollutants and make public whenever the levels 
exceed the federal standard 
the proposed regulations will not go into effect until a routine 
comment period likely about 90 days and then the epa will give 
local water officials another 18 months before the tighter 
requirements take effect in some cases where economic hardship can 
be shown water officials will be given additional time to comply 
the federal standards on the 38 chemicals including many widely 
used pesticides and other highly toxic carcinogens would bring the 
number of chemicals on which federal standards have either been 
proposed or are in effect to 55 
three years ago congress directed epa to set maximum allowable 
levels on 83 chemicals and other toxic pollutants but agency 
officials said tuesday they will not be able to meet the 
congressionally imposed june 1 deadline on 28 of them 
cook said development of federal standards on the remaining 28 
is likely to take another year as maximum safe levels and water 
treatment techniques are worked out 
if we had more money and manpower we could have sped those 
up said cook 
the proposed standards announced tuesday cover 17 pesticides 
including alachlor aldicarb and atrazine which are widely used in 
agriculture 11 synthetic organic chemicals that have been found to 
cause cancer or damage to the nervous system and eight inorganic 
chemicals including asbestos mercury cadmium nitrates and 
nitrites and two chemicals used to treat drinking water 
the requirements are important steps in the continuing effort 
to assure that americans have the safest drinking water in the 
world said cook 
but some epa critics maintained that the regulations while slow 
in coming are also too weak 
jacqueline warren an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said the maximum levels required by the epa are 
significantly higher than ceilings already required by a number of 
states 
furthermore she said the epa is lifting some water pollutant 
standards including the ones for aluminum and silver both pose 
health risks she said

president bush is keeping his options open on 
how to deal with panama once it holds its election which us 
officials predict will be rife with fraud 
bush on tuesday urged panamas neighbors and us allies in 
europe to speak out against election fraud in panama as he 
stepped up the rhetoric against the countrys defacto ruler gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
bushs advisers have been working on policy options to employ 
after sundays election and no option has been ruled out said 
a state department official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
however this official and others have acknowledged that one 
possibility is remote that of military intervention by the united 
states which maintains a hefty military presence along the panama 
canal 
they also say there is scant chance the united states will renew 
the offer it made to noriega a year ago to abandon federal 
drugtrafficking charges against him if he leaves panama noriega 
has been indicted by a federal grand jury in florida 
the drug case began the slide in the oncecozy uspanama 
relationship 
economic and trade sanctions instituted last year under 
president reagan have been extended by bush but have failed to 
loosen noriegas grip on the country 
on tuesday the president told a latinoriented business group 
the council of the americas that it is evident that the regime 
is ready to resort to massive election fraud in order to remain in 
power the noriega regime continues to threaten and intimidate 
panamanians who believe in democracy 
the united states will not recognize the results of a 
fraudulent election engineered simply to keep noriega in power 
while attempting to discredit the election ahead of time by 
saying that noriega has rigged it to ensure victory for his 
presidential candidate carlos duque the administration has not 
declared what postelection pressures it might bring to bear 
much will depend on what the panamanians do said the state 
department source the official noted that an antinoriega fervor 
that was building last year among the people seems to have lost its 
momentum whether such sentiment is manifested again after the 
election will no doubt influence the us position the official 
said 
in panama maj edgardo lopez a spokesman for the pronoriega 
panamanian defense forces said the opposition is demoralized and 
they know they are going to lose the election he said they sent 
an sos to the white house 
bush also on tuesday criticized the election plans being laid by 
the leftist sandinista government of nicaragua 
he outlined guidelines by which the united states will judge 
whether the nicaraguan elections next february are free and fair 
saying the sandinistas must allow outside observers to have access 
to all election places and proceedings 
it means a secret ballot on election day the freedom to 
campaign to organize to hold rallies and to poll public opinion 
to operate independent radio and tv stations as well bush said

business representatives contend that american 
workers would be better off if congress repealed a new law aimed at 
barring healthinsurance discrimination against lowerpaid 
employees 
we remain skeptical that it does anything to improve or extend 
coverage of health care james h gardner a californian speaking 
for the national federation of independent business told the house 
ways and means committee tuesday 
gardner said house legislation to revise the law would be an 
improvement but that the best course would be outright repeal 
it will still be a new impediment and disincentive to 
employers especially smaller employers to provide health 
insurance gardner said 
similar objections were raised by other business representatives 
who testified before the tax panel but spokesmen for the treasury 
department the aflcio and the accounting profession leaned toward 
revising the law known as internal revenue code section 89 rather 
than repealing it 
prompt congressional action is needed to alleviate the 
problems employers are experiencing in complying with section 89 
said dana l trier tax legislative counsel for the treasury 
department we believe the revision bill represents a major 
step forward in achieving these goals 
he said treasury advocates a complete revision of present law 
which he called a complicated mess 
the law enacted in 1986 aims to ensure that taxdeductible 
health insurance plans do not discriminate in favor of higherpaid 
employees the statute requires employers to subject their health 
plans to complex tests to determine whether they discriminate 
some employers say the complexity paperwork and cost 50 per 
worker by one estimate are so onerous that they will find it 
easier to drop their health plans rather than try to comply with 
the law 
business has made repeal or modification of the law a major goal 
this year congress has heard so many complaints that 300 house 
members and close to a majority of the senate have signed bills to 
repeal the law most members of the ways and means committee have 
signed the revision bill whose chief sponsor is chairman dan 
rostenkowski dill 
the complaints have been heard by the bush administration too 
treasury secretary nicholas brady announced monday that employers 
would not have to test their health plans for compliance before 
oct 1 the law originally had a jan 1 1989 deadline 
the federal government forgoes more than 30 billion a year in 
taxes on the value of employerfinanced health coverage 
rostenkowskis bill would eliminate most of the complicated 
testing by requiring employers to provide to at least 90 percent of 
their lowerpaid workers health insurance costing the employees no 
more than 10 a month for a single plan or no more than 25 for 
family coverage 
calvin johnson legislative representative for the aflcio 
praised rostenkowskis bill but said the labor federation questions 
whether it would make it possible for working families to qualify 
for coverage he recommended that a workers outofpocket spending 
for medical expenses be limited to 3000 a year and that the 
25aweek maximum premium under the bill be reduced 
the committee was asked to provide special exemptions for state 
and local governments since such employers pay no federal taxes 
and thus receive no tax deduction for the costs of workers 
insurance 
lee cooke mayor of austin texas speaking for the national 
league of cities said at least 27 states require workers to pay 
more than 10 a week for a single health policy or more than 25 
weekly for a family plan 
overall cooke said while congressional concern about the 
30billionayear subsidy for health plans is understandable we 
believe that the burdens of the law far outweigh the benefits in 
the public sector

chief justice william h rehnquist urged 
congress today to give the nations federal judges an immediate 30 
percent pay raise 
calling inadequate salaries the most serious threat to the 
future of the judiciary rehnquist sought support for legislation 
providing the raise and regular costofliving adjustments 
this is not in my view fairly termed a pay raise 
rehnquist said in a prepared statement to the house post office and 
civil service committee this is instead a partial recapture of 
the tremendous decline in purchasing power that has affected 
judicial salaries over the last 20 years 
a 30 percent pay increase would boost the chief justices annual 
salary from 115000 to 149500 salaries of supreme court 
justices would rise from 110000 to 143000 appeals court judges 
from 95000 to 123500 and trial judges from 89500 to 116500 
there are about 700 active federal judges about 300 others are 
on senior status meaning they do as much or as little work as they 
wish all receive the same raises 
as chief justice rehnquist is a member of the supreme court 
heads the federal judiciary and chairs the policymaking us 
judicial conference 
he said the judicial conference recognizes there was 
widespread public opposition to a defeated proposal for a 51 
percent pay raise for senior government officials including 
members of congress and federal judges 
we believe however that a smaller increase of 30 percent for 
federal judges is both publicly acceptable and fully justified 
rehnquist said 
the chief justice also emphasized the importance of routine 
costofliving adjustments in judicial salaries which he said 
could well obviate the need for the sort of sizable catchup 
increases being proposed 
currently federal judges receive the periodic raises given to 
most federal employees by congress 
congress historical reluctance to increase its own pay levels 
has often meant that costofliving increases for other senior 
government officials have also been denied rehnquist said 
under the legislation backed by the judicial conference 
costofliving raises for judges would not be tied to similar 
raises for congress 
despite rehnquists complaint about infrequent costofliving 
increases federal judges have received them in most years since 
1975 during that period district court salaries have risen from 
42000 to 89500 and appellate court salaries from 44600 to 
95000 
last week five democratic and republican members of the house 
courts subcommittee advised a panel of leading judges that public 
protests would likely block any judicial pay raise unless 
nonworking seniors judges were excluded the judges opposed such 
limits 
the associated press earlier this year reported previously 
unpublished federal figures showing that in 1987 some 20 percent of 
the then306 senior judges did no judicial work including former 
chief justice warren burger 
rep robert kastenmeier dwis and rep carlos moorhead 
rcalif chairman and ranking minority member on the subcommittee 
subsequently submitted legislation to bar pay raises other than 
costofliving increases from senior judges who carry less than 25 
percent of an active judges caseload 
but they also agreed at the judges request to submit a bill 
calling for the general 30 percent raise and annual costofliving 
increases 
president bush has proposed a 25 percent increase along with a 
ban on speaking fees and a limit on outside earned income the 
judges oppose both the ban and the limit

the national association of broadcasters 
concluded its annual gathering with a rousing call to arms by 
outgoing fcc chairman dennis patrick to resist government intrusion 
into radio and tv 
patrick who led the federal communications commissions repeal 
of the fairness doctrine that required broadcasters to present 
opposing views of public issues said tuesday that broadcasting has 
a constitutional duty to express opinions 
you are all members of the press no less than the editorial 
boards of the new york times and the wall street journal patrick 
said we the members of the public want to hear what you have 
to say we deserve to know your opinions 
but he added you are powerful and for that reason we in 
government have just cause to fear you 
at the same time he said government has no cause to attempt 
to regulate your speech stand firm against any attempt to do so 
even though the fcc lifted the fairness doctrine from 
broadcasters in 1987 congress is almost sure to reinstate it this 
year posing a veto fight with president bush and a likely supreme 
court test 
patricks speech outlining the fccs accomplishments was 
interrupted a number of times by applause from the broadcasters and 
exhibitors who descended on this gambling mecca for a fourday 
meeting 
nab said there were a record 50136 registrants this year and 
709 exhibitors plied a wide range of broadcasting hardware 
highdefinition television predominated with more than 22000 
square feet of exhibit space and numerous technical and regulatory 
panel discussions devoted to the multibilliondollar television of 
the future 
patrick thanked his audience for their unflagging support of 
his policies against a hostile congress and nonbroadcast media 
during his six years at the fcc 
we have tried to foster competition at the fcc by lowering 
barriers to entry and by permitting broadcasters to compete as 
freely as those with whom they compete namely cable patrick 
said 
patrick announced last month he had resigned from the agency 
where he has been chairman for the past two years but would stay 
on until his replacement is confirmed 
the 37yearold california native said he would leave 
government but has announced no future plans 
in addition to repealing the fairness doctrine the fcc during 
patricks tenure reinstated rules giving broadcasters exclusive 
rights to programming in their broadcasting areas over cable 
outlets he said 
he advocated further protection from the cable tv industry 
through a requirement that cable systems pay for the overtheair 
programs they feed to their subscribers 
patrick noted how the fcc revised the means by which stations 
renew their licenses to bar sham competitors who just want money to 
drop their challenges to a stations license 
and he noted the fccs decision last year to make sure that a 
us standard for highdefinition television will not render 
obsolete the huge investment tv stations have in current equipment 
american industry is racing to adopt standards with which to 
build an hdtv system and stave off the expected appearance in the 
next couple of years of foreignmade hdtv vcrs and movies 
patrick said broadcasters still faced many challenges 
fiberoptic cable and telephone entry into video programming 
competition from foreign media further loss of audience the 
shifting of advertising from video to point of sales

states should set guidelines for awards in 
damage suits because juries are blind to the impact their liability 
judgments have beyond the courtroom an organization of business 
executives and educators said today 
the benefits are immediate and visible compensation to an 
often tragically injured individual who is present in the 
courtroom the committee for economic development said in a 
176page report by its research and policy committee 
in contrast the magnitude of the costs and the bearer of 
those costs are largely invisible the ced said 
the committee recommended adoption of statutory guidelines based 
on such formulas as replacement of twothirds of the plaintiffs 
wages which it said is roughly full replacement of aftertax 
earnings 
future wage loss for children could be calculated at the 
median annual earnings in the state the panel said similar 
general principles should be applied for calculating compensation 
for medical rehabilitation and special educational expenses 
a fundamental flaw of setting the terms of a social insurance 
program through the courts is that the jury has neither the 
information nor the incentives to weigh the costs of its decisions 
against the benefits the committee said 
it said one study showed that between 1960 and 1984 the average 
jury verdict in california and cook county ill increased by more 
than 300 percent in 1984 dollars after adjustment for inflation 
the ced describes itself as a nonprofit nonpartisan and 
nonpolitical educational organization of more than 200 business 
executives and educators seeking to formulate policies to foster 
economic growth and an improved standard of living 
the panel said the current liability system neither 
effectively deters nor efficiently compensates and the united 
states should relay more heavily on alternative methods of dispute 
resolution 
in addition to increasing legal fees court awards and insurance 
costs the present system results in indirect cots to americans in 
higher prices withdrawn goods and services and damaged 
international competitiveness the study said 
it called for a limit on punitive damages a uniform federal law 
on product liability and more reliance on regulation to control 
environmental and chemical hazards 
it said workers compensation should be revised and made the 
sole recourse for injuries and diseases of the workplace 
it also called for prohibiting lawsuits when a product complies 
with regulation except in cases of fraud or suppression of 
evidence 
it proposed a ban on liability for risks that could not be 
anticipated at the time the product was manufactured 
punitive damages should be awarded only in cases of willful 
misconduct and should be limited to a modest multiple of the 
compensatory award the committee said it said this would 
preserve incentives for prudent attention to risk while 
avoiding exposure to unpredictable and potentially bankrupting 
punitive awards

president bush will spell out the conclusions 
of his wideranging foreign policy review in the next few weeks in 
a series of commencement addresses dealing with eastwest 
relations the soviet union and nato the white house says 
basically it will point out the bush view of the world and the 
united states role in it and our attitude toward other 
countries white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
tuesday 
there will be some differences with existing policy although 
the general thrust will not be too different fitzwater said 
its not clear to me there will ever be any written reports 
about the review fitzwater said these speeches may in effect be 
the most definitive enunciation of the results of that review 
bush is scheduled to give five commencement speeches this month 
beginning with a may 12 address at texas aampm university fitzwater 
said the topic of that speech will be foreign policy although it 
is not clear what the focus will be 
a may 21 speech at boston university will spell out bushs view 
of eastwest relations and us strategy for dealing with the 
soviet union the spokesman said 
then bush will use a may 24 speech at the us coast guard 
academy in new london conn to discuss the strength of nato and 
the future of the 16nation western alliance 
two days later bush will fly to rome on the first leg of a 
fournation trip and a full nato summit may 2930 in recent days 
nato has been shaken by a dispute over modernization of shortrange 
nuclear weapons stationed in west germany 
bushs speeches will follow on the heels of next weeks trip to 
moscow by secretary of state james a baker iii for talks with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze 
bakers trip is expected to produce a date for resumption of 
negotiations to cut back longrange nuclear weapons and explore 
possibilities for a summit sometime this year between bush and 
gorbachev 
the arms talks went into recess late last year and were expected 
to resume in february but were put off by bush pending completion 
of the foreign policy reviews 
fitzwater said the nato summit and a sevennation economic 
summit in paris in july will give further definition to bushs 
policies 
with the first 100 days of bushs administration completed 
fitzwater said the next three months will concentrate heavily on 
foreign policy objectives 
other commencement addresses by bush this month will be on may 
13 at alcorn state university in lorman miss and at mississippi 
state university at starkville on the same day

when president bush travels to new york he 
gets there quicker than george washington but slower than ronald 
reagan 
thats because bush has eliminated one link in the trip used by 
reagan a fast helicopter ride into manhattan from a nearby 
airport usually newark 
instead bush prefers to travel within new york by motorcade 
and that means he must land at the most distant of new yorks 
three major airports kennedy 
closerin laguardia wont accommodate air force one a boeing 
707 and he cant use newark across the hudson river in new 
jersey for security and national defense reasons 
a motorcade trip from newark would require the presidents 
motorcade to pass through a tunnel under the river and that would 
put the chief executive out of radio contact with the rest of the 
world unless special communications cables were laid through the 
tunnel deemed by the white house not worth the expense or effort 
so bush who has been to new york twice as president travels 
through the nations most populous city entirely by motorcade 
producing monumental traffic tieups as he goes 
for last sundays trip when bush participated in a reenactment 
of washingtons inauguration 200 years before bush traveled by 
motorcade all the way from kennedy international airport on long 
island to wall street in lower manhattan a trip of about 35 
minutes 
bushs decision not to use a helicopter to get into new york was 
based on his preference to save money said spokesman stephen 
hart 
at a time when were facing budgetary constraints its one 
way he could have an impact hart said 
hart said it was not clear how much was really saved by such a 
step however 
usually four helicopters were involved when reagan traveled 
from newark airport into manhattan usually to a helipad at the 
battery one helicopter for the president and his top aides one 
for the secret service another for lesserranking staff and a 
press chopper 
at least some of the helicopters had to be flown up from 
washington 
however official motorcades through new york are to say it 
mildly interesting 
they are sometimes chaotic hectic frightening exhilarating 
and always gridlockforming 
as president bush gets streets barricaded for him along the 
motorcade route that presents an unusual sight to anyone familiar 
with new yorks usually clogged streets block after block of 
temporarily empty pavement 
of course side streets and entrance ramps along the way become 
hopelessly clogged with stopped traffic 
as vice president and as a candidate bush didnt always rate 
such treatment and his new york motorcades often had to vie with 
and fend off other traffic 
sirens and flashing lights seem to have less effect on traffic 
in new york than in other cities cars buses and cabs frequently 
dart in and out of the path of nonpresidential motorcades 
when a motorcade slows down too much or too much of a gap opens 
between cars pedestrians and bicyclists often stream perilously 
across the street between the gaps 
during a campaign visit last spring a vehicle in thenvice 
president bushs motorcade struck a cab trying to edge into the 
flow of traffic crumpling its side the motorcade kept moving the 
cab driver shaking his fist and hurling epithets 
new york motorcades usually produce a higher percentage of 
hand and finger gestures asserts one white house staff member 
is saving the cost of helicopters worth the added cost of more 
police officers along motorcade routes and the jangled nerves of 
those caught in traffic jams 
you have to try to strike a balance said bush spokesman 
hart 
and he noted reagan only took choppers from the airport into 
the city he still had to travel by motorcade within manhattan 
although it takes bush longer than reagan to get to a new york 
site hes still a lot swifter than the nations first president 
whose steps bush retraced last sunday 
it took washington a week in 1789 to travel from mount vernon 
in virginia near what is now the nations capital to new york 
which was then the nations capital and he did it by horseback 
coach and barge

students in china traditionally have looked to 
the west for models of democracy but this time they also are 
inspired by currents of change across the border in the soviet 
union 
these chinese see president mikhail s gorbachevs policies of 
glasnost or greater openness as an example they would like 
their countrys leaders to follow 
china and the soviet union share similar histories of autocratic 
government state repression and socialist economic stagnation 
in recent years both countries have launched marketoriented 
reforms aimed at modernizing their economies and raising living 
standards to meet citizens growing expectations 
economic liberalization under senior leader deng xiaoping has 
brought relative prosperity to millions of chinese 
however deng has refused to imitate gorbachevs political 
reforms which have allowed unprecedented open debate in the soviet 
union over sensitive political issues 
only on the studentestablished freespeech platforms in the 
streets of beijing during the past two weeks have chinese tasted 
anything approaching glasnost there students and workers alike 
have engaged in heated debates over chinas political history 
economic problems and growing official corruption 
thousands of prodemocracy protesters have taken to the streets 
since midapril and more demonstrations loomed after the government 
today turned down a student demand that new independent student 
unions be recognized 
the students demands that the government end official 
privilege nepotism and profiteering have especially struck a raw 
nerve among many chinese who are angered by 30 percent inflaction 
and blatant displays of illgotten wealth 
the workers who joined the students in last weeks triumphant 
march through beijings streets said the leaderships refusal to 
enact democratic reforms and allow the press to freely speak out 
against abuse of privilege are partly to blame for the countrys 
economic woes 
sure theres been some improvement and i do better than most 
people said taxi driver zheng jun but the leaderships rotten 
to the core and its incompetent too 
there should be a way for the ordinary people to reach the 
government with their problems he said 
chinese dissident fang lizhi in a recent essay alluded to the 
soviet example when he called for use of open glasnoststyle 
means to root out corruption 
the chinese communist party has said political reform meaning a 
shrinking of its role in government and business will take a 
decade and that it will be at least 20 to 30 years before national 
elections are possible a slow process the students want to 
accelerate 
the soviets are ahead of us at least they have elections 
said another beijing resident 
maybe when gorbachev comes to china on may 15 we can 
demonstrate and get his help said beijing university student 
wang qiang 
while they have turned to moscow for support and ideas the 
students concepts of democracy and freedom were inherited from an 
earlier generation of chinese intellectuals many of whom studied 
at the sorbonne oxford and harvard and returned to spearhead 
protests in their homeland 
chinese who studied in the west played key roles in the may 4 
1919 student prodemocracy movement and in the communist revolution 
the t students who want fundamental reform of chinas 
tightly controlled political system and an end to widespread 
corruption se western democracies as models frotests 
freedom of speech and the press and democracy views shared by 
many chinese 
numerous students said american student protests in the 1960s 
against the vietnam war inspired them to take to te streets 
despite the fact thamerica at that time was chinas no 1 enemy 
dont american students protest too they asked repeatedl few 
expect concrete support for their efforts from abroad but 
they did welcome news of a us state departmtatement may 26 
that said the united states believes in and supports the right 
of peaceful ly including peaceful protest and the freedom onot only in 
china but around the world 
the students repeatedly ask journalists to report the news of 
thts accurately to let the world know what is happening 
in china one student said and so other countries can support 
us 
we want support from around the worldsaid another

defense secretary dick cheney has quietly 
rescinded a nineyearold ban on us military personnel attending 
soviet functions celebrating may day and other occasions 
the decision disclosed tuesday by defense sources and confirmed 
by the pentagons chief spokesman was announced in a memorandum 
dated april 27 that was distributed throughout the us military 
the memo states cheney had lifted restrictions on attendance 
by department of defense personnel at soviet receptions or other 
functions in the united states to mark may day or victory in europe 
day imposed after the soviet invasion of afghanistan in december 
1979 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman said the decision 
simply reflected the soviet unions recent withdrawal of troops 
from afghanistan and nothing more 
a similar restriction on highlevel state department personnel 
was lifted in midfebruary according to administration sources 
that was why us ambassador jack matlock viewed the may day 
festivities in moscow on monday from the official diplomatic review 
stand the first time that has been done in 10 years the sources 
said 
according to cmdr mel sundin another pentagon spokesman 
activeduty and civilian defense officials were specifically barred 
in early 1980 from accepting invitations to functions tied to four 
key soviet military observances soviet national day in november 
armed forces day in february may day on may 1 and victory in 
europe day on may 9 
the ban was imposed by the carter administration just after the 
invasion and has been rigidly enforced ever since said one 
defense official who requested anonymity 
the first change in that enforcement occurred last november when 
some restrictions were relaxed governing soviet national day and 
armed forces day observances sundin said at the time the soviets 
had agreed under united nations auspices to withdraw their troops 
from afghanistan 
now that the withdrawal is complete cheney has lifted all the 
restrictions sundin added 
cheneys decision was disclosed just a few days after he made 
headlines by predicting kremlin chief mikhail s gorbachevs 
efforts to overhaul the soviet economy would fail 
gorbachev who got the russian troops out of afghanistan is 
likely to fail with his restructuring efforts and be replaced by a 
leader far more hostile to the west cheney said in a tv 
interview broadcast last saturday

jacqueline bouvier kennedy onassis is not the 
frail whisperyvoiced woman the american people saw standing by 
the side of president kennedy says the author of an unauthorized 
biography of the former first lady 
the real jackie says writer c david heymann is a 
strongwilled woman who was probably a principal designer of the 
kennedy administrations camelot image 
the image of this good catholic husband with two beautiful 
children and a beautiful wife posing on the white house lawn was 
not the case he said 
in his book a woman named jackie which went on sale 
tuesday heymann attempted to unravel the life and character of one 
of the worlds most admired photographed and writtenabout yet 
enigmatic women 
although there have been so many things written about her 
nothing i read really did the woman justice he said in a 
telephone interview everything was based on gossip and innuendo 
i felt something along definite lines should be written 
his 631page book is based on interviews with 825 people 
including friends employees and family members but none of the 
kennedys 
the author by appealing to the director of presidential 
libraries in washington dc gained access to the former first 
ladys white house social files through the freedom of information 
act he obtained thousands of pages of previously undisclosed fbi 
cia and secret service files 
heymanns purpose was not to document the public successes and 
failures of the kennedys years in the white house but to 
scrutinize their successes and failures as individuals as husband 
and wife 
indeed a good portion of the book is devoted to the slain 
presidents many alleged liaisons with women 
a lot of this wasnt my original intention to go into his 
affairs in such depth said heymann i had merely heard all the 
rumors and innuendo but as a result of digging into various 
files a lot of this became fact not merely rumor 
mrs onassis spokeswoman nancy tuckerman has said mrs 
onassis would not comment on the book a telephone message left at 
her office tuesday was not returned 
according to heymann kennedy once sneaked out of a new york 
hotel for a sexual liaison without telling the secret service and 
without taking the list of codes he needed in the event of a 
nuclear attack 
langdon marvin jr a former defense consultant to kennedy who 
had accompanied him on the jaunt was quoted in the book as saying 
the russians could have bombed us to hell and back and there 
would have been nothing we could have done about it 
the date of the alleged incident was not given marvin died in 
1987 according to sandra bodner a spokeswoman for the publisher 
lyle stuart 
heymann wrote that mrs kennedy who married kennedy in 1953 
responded to her husbands sexual dalliances by being glacially 
cold toward him and going on spending sprees 
it was at these junctures that she went on shopping binges 
disbursing thousands of dollars on jewelry designer clothes 
paintings whatever captured her fancy he wrote 
after the august 1963 death of the kennedys third child when 
the boy was just 3 days old the couple seemed to grow closer in 
their grief heymann wrote 
but mrs kennedys life was shattered on nov 22 1963 in 
dallas when her husband was assassinated while riding with her in a 
motorcade 
heymann wrote that the first lady refused to take a sedative as 
she waited in her bloodsplattered outfit at parkland memorial 
hospital 
i dont want a sedative mrs kennedy reportedly said i 
want to be with my husband when he dies

a bill that would give airlines and airports 
270 million for devices to detect plastic explosives goes before a 
house committee thursday after a subcommittee rejected republican 
efforts to make airlines pay half the cost 
the legislation requires installation of the sophisticated units 
in us and foreign airports that are considered vulnerable to 
terrorists it does the same thing as a transportation department 
order last month which would have airlines pay the full cost of 
the units 
the bill passed tuesday by the house public works aviation 
subcommittee would take the 270 million from an aviation trust 
fund without budgeting new money the fund has accumulated more 
than 6 billion in fees collected from airline passengers for 
airport improvements 
republicans tried to amend the measure to require that us 
airlines pay half the cost but the bill received no opposing votes 
when it passed with full federal funding for the security devices 
the transportation department last month ordered airlines to 
install the sophisticated bombdetection machines at highrisk 
airports both the order and the legislation call for detection 
systems such as thermal neutron devices that have been tested by 
the federal aviation administration 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said tuesday he expects 
the first machine to be installed in july at john f kennedy 
international airport in new york and the second at an airport in 
great britain he said several more should be in place before the 
end of the year 
skinner was in europe last week meeting with officials of other 
governments about aviation security as a result of the dec 21 
bombing of pan am flight 103 over scotland that killed 270 people 
he said the administration feels the airlines should pay for 
additional security using revenue from security fees collected 
with passengers tickets 
the legislation would provide up to 100 percent grants to us 
airlines and airports which would own operate and maintain the 
detection units expected to cost about 1 million each the airline 
grants also would cover installation in highrisk foreign airports 
subcommittee chairman rep james oberstar dminn argued that 
the government should pay for the devices that would examine 
checkedin baggage because the government not airlines has been 
the target of terrorists 
other governments will be paying for security units used by 
their airlines which would put them at a competitive advantage 
oberstar said 
republicans argued that airlines have always paid for security 
equipment at airports and the subsidy could lead to other moves to 
use federal money to help airlines

american agents are plugged into the 
underworld of illegal diversion of deadly chemical weapons 
materials but their successes are being undermined by the courts 
says the us customs commissioner 
the penalties we have are there william von raab told the 
senate governmental affairs committee at a hearing tuesday on the 
illegal export of biological agents and other material used to make 
chemical weapons the problem is judges dont apply them 
the customs service through informants and various sting 
operations has controlled to some degree the diversion of the 
materials to terrorist nations von raab said 
with the volume were dealing with i dont think were losing 
a lot he said were pretty well plugged into the underworld 
however the effort by the customs service the state department 
and the commerce department has been thwarted by the judicial 
system which has failed to impose stiffer penalties von raab said 
the commissioner described the case of peter walaschek a west 
german national arrested for purchasing three orders of 
thiodiglycol a precursor for mustard gas from alcolac 
international inc of baltimore md for shipment to greece and 
singapore the shipments were reexported to iran 
customs agents suspicious of walascheks third order told 
inspectors in norfolk va to seize the chemical and replace it 
with water the agents then tracked the shipment of water to 
singapore karachi pakistan and then bandar abbas iran 
walaschek was arrested on july 27 1988 in maryland and pleaded 
guilty to violating the export administration act he admitted that 
he purchased the chemical at the request of sayed kharim ali 
sobhani an iranian diplomat stationed at his countrys embassy in 
bonn west germany 
but under protests from the government walaschek was placed in 
a halfway house he later fled and is currently a fugitive in west 
germany 
von raab said another part of the problem is that the criminals 
give the impression of being average businessmen 
they look normal theyve done normal things offering and 
accepting merchandise but what theyre dealing with is poison 
the commissioner said 
the chemical industry is the united states largest 
international trading industry with total shipments in 1988 at 238 
billion according to the commerce department current export 
controls apply to 40 of an estimated 20000 commercially traded 
chemicals and chemical products

a top air force general has offered a 
surprising amount of detail about the new b2 stealth bomber 
disclosing it will have great range an ability to land almost 
anywhere and a payload of 25 tons of bombs 
the planes capabilities will be such that had the b2 been 
available in 1986 when american bombers attacked tripoli libya 
just three to four b2s could have done the job direct from 
stateside bases said gen bernard p randolph the head of the 
air force systems command 
more than 100 combat and support aircraft from the air force and 
navy were used for that bombing mission the b2 would require at 
most two tankers to fuel it during the mission randolph said 
randolph in making his revelations last weekend said little 
about the cost of the b2 or of defense secretary dick cheneys 
recent budget decision to postpone the start of production by a 
full year 
but he asserted to a meeting of aviation reporters in phoenix 
ariz that the b2 was nothing less than a quantum leap into the 
21st century that was essential to americas future strength 
thanks to its ability to slip behind enemy lines without being 
detected on radar 
randolph appeared before the reporters on saturday a text of 
his remarks was released later at the pentagon 
not only is the b2 destined to become a key part of americas 
nuclear arsenal but it offers a capability to deliver conventional 
weapons that is unmatched among manned bombers randolph said 
the libyan bombing raid could have been conducted with greater 
tactical surprise and vastly less risk of life he said 
among randolphs disclosures 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the b2 will be capable of flying more than 6000 nautical 
miles or 6900 statute miles without refueling with one 
midair refueling it will be able to fly more than 10000 nautical 
miles or 11500 statute miles 
the plane will have a maximum takeoff weight of more than 
350000 pounds and will be able to carry up to 50000 pounds of 
either nuclear or conventional bombs specifically it will be able 
to carry 16 large nuclear weapons 20 smaller nuclear bombs or up 
to 80 conventional 500pound bombs the b52 the mainstay 
strategic bomber carries 60000 tons of bombs 
the plane is designed to operate with minimal support equipment 
and can land on any runway thats just 40 feet wide meaning it 
can operate from any airfield that can handle a 727 commercial 
airliner 
with one air refueling operating from just four bases two 
stateside and two overseas the b2 could cover any point on the 
worlds land mass on a nonstop radius mission carrying a full 
conventional payload randolph said 
those possibilities could deter a great deal of adventurism 
randolph also announced the first flight of the b2 would 
probably occur in about two months but only when the air force was 
convinced the plane was ready 
the b2 built primarily by northrop corp is a 
futuristiclooking grayand black flying wing designed to evade 
enemy radar and deliver nuclear weapons it resembles a huge 
tailless manta ray with wide sweeping wings blending smoothly into 
a rounded cockpit and engine housings on the top side 
the stealth gets its name from the claim that it will be 
extremely difficult to detect by enemy radar due to the extensive 
use of exotic composite materials its lack of sharp surface 
angles and a crosssection that offers a very small profile to 
radar 
before cheneys decision to slow production the air force had 
estimated 132 of the planes would cost 681 billion even if money 
spent on research and development is set aside that amounts to 
production costs of 305 million per plane

developing community therere omelette makings for some 
huevos egg circle and jamon ham lane are some of the street 
names in the same neighborhood of mission viejo which has grown 
from scratch to 75000 people in 23 years 
the spanish heritage of the area has inspired some fanciful 
names for places and streets the original rancho mission viejo was 
established under a spanish land grant 
the story was told that when they decided to have a spanish 
theme for the community barcelona walls franciscan bells 
spanishthemed architecture they decided all streets would have 
spanish names said wendy wetzel director of corporate 
communications for the mission viejo co 
but ronald harmon professor of spanish and portuguese at 
california state university fullerton said some of the names are 
silly 
unfortunately people dont often have a clear sense of what it 
means to use another language so they use it 
impressionistically harmon said it just sounds spanishy 
the other thing is that people have a tendency to seek the exotic 
and foreign names are exotic 
the race to name streets included one called rabida rabid

civil rights activist jesse jackson says 
questions remain over the appointment of william lucas to head 
the justice departments civil rights division but he supports 
lucas nonetheless 
jackson commented after meeting tuesday with attorney general 
dick thornburgh who said later that he had made a pitch to 
jackson about lucas 61 whose nomination has been opposed by the 
naacp 
jackson revealed his attitude toward lucas only in response to a 
reporters questions and when asked directly whether he supported 
him jackson said only yes 
i hope that he will honor the trust that the government is 
putting in him jackson said i have reason to believe he 
will 
the nomination of lucas a black democratturnedrepublican who 
lost a race for governor of michigan in 1986 has been opposed by 
the national association for the advancement of colored people the 
nations oldest and largest civil rights group 
also opposing the nomination is rep william h gray dpa who 
said he was surprised by jacksons support 
i dont know why mr jackson said what he said said gray 
the chairman of the democratic caucus 
lucas is an outstanding human being but his public service 
has been in law enforcement said gray 
he is better suited for deputy drug czar or deputy fbi 
director and not as chief policy maker on civil rights enforcement 
in the justice department in light of no litigatory experience or 
policy experience unless youre making the assumption that anybody 
with black skin has the qualifications said gray who is black 
i dont make that assumption and i find it offensive when people 
do make that assumption 
lucas a detroit lawyer has been an fbi agent sheriff of wayne 
county mich and the chief executive for that county thornburgh 
spokesman dave runkel said the assistant attorney general position 
is a law enforcement job and needs someone with a law enforcement 
background and management background 
among those supporting lucas are some members of the 
congressional black caucus and the rev joseph lowery president of 
the southern christian leadership conference 
rep john conyers a black democrat from detroit said a senate 
fight by civil rights groups to block the lucas nomination would 
be a useless one maybe even counterproductive he invited 
members of the caucus to meet informally with lucas on tuesday 
afternoon 
the nominee spent more than an hour with seven members of the 
23member caucus 
jackson said one of the main reasons he visited thornburgh was 
to fight for the rights of sugar cane workers from jamaica and the 
british west indies 
because the sugar cane growers have lobbied to exempt sugar 
cane as a perishable product they are less eligible to get their 
green cards and are therefore denied access to citizenship in this 
country he said 
jackson also criticized public housing officials who following 
the leadership of housing and urban development secretary jack 
kemp are evicting innocent people when one family member is 
involved with drugs 
i talked to a mother today who has lived in an apartment for 
24 years and her son was arrested not arrested indicted tried 
and convicted just arrested and her furniture is on the 
street he said 
thornburgh told jackson to talk with kemp about the situation 
a hud spokesman said kemp has been quite cautious in deciding 
where waivers should be granted on federal administrative rules 
regarding evictions those waivers will only be granted in those 
states where the due process rights of the tenants will clearly be 
protected

folks in zap still shudder when they 
recall the day 20 years ago when 2000 drunken college students 
rioted on main street and set a bonfire causing 3000 in damage 
saturday a new generation of students plan a sequel 
but denise schlegel organizer of zip to zap ii promises a more 
sedate celebration one she hopes can erase hard feelings that have 
festered in the town of 300 people since 1969 
i want to show them that people are different and things like 
this can work out said the 21yearold junior at north dakota 
state university in fargo we are mending fences in a way 
the school newspaper the spectrum organized the first zip to 
zap for a spring fling but chaos erupted that may day and the 
national guard was called in to disperse the rowdy students 
although many zap townspeople are apprehensive about college 
students again invading the quiet hamlet schlegel the editor of 
the spectrum believes zip to zap ii not only will restore her 
newspapers image it also will provide an economic boon to the 
town about 90 miles northwest of bismarck 
it all started as a spectrum picnic in zap 20 years ago she 
said we have gotten a bad rap from it and i just want to show 
that things can work out people can get together in a gathering 
and it doesnt have to be a disaster i dont think the 
drinking is the same as it was 20 years ago 
schlegel harbors no fears that zip to zap ii will get out of 
control calling todays college students more mature and less 
radical than their 1960s counterparts 
i dont think we are going to be starting street fires she 
said 
schlegel expects up to 1000 students from campuses across north 
dakota to descend on zap for 11 hours of free rock n roll plus 
some volleyball games 
six bands have volunteered for the show which starts at 1 pm 
in a pasture near the town she said 
zap is gearing up to handle 2000 people said tammy schmidt 
president of the community club a civic organization with 20 
active members 
schmidt 29 barely remembers the may 10 1969 event when she 
was living with her family in nearby beulah but said everybody 
was scared seeing it on television 
the mercer county sheriffs department expects to have about 15 
officers in zap on saturday and highway patrol officers also will 
be around deputy sheriff dean nodland said tuesday we really 
dont foresee that it is going to get out of hand he said 
townspeople in zap are split on whether another batch of college 
revelers should even be let into town schmidt said some want the 
town barricaded they harbor the bad memories she said 
she doesnt expect a repeat of the disturbance but remains 
cautious 
when people are intoxicated moods swing if we knew this was 
an annual event we would know what to prepare for but with a 
20year gap in it it leaves anything and everything up in the 
air schmidt said 
the town is hoping to cash in however at least seven portable 
food stands will be set up schmidt said and the zap community 
club had 500 souvenir tshirts printed with the message 
i zipped to zap and had a blast

president bushs announced plan to sell 15 
million metric tons of subsidized wheat to the soviet union was 
praised in congress but didnt settle concerns about the future of 
the export bonus program 
senate republican leader bob dole who had pressed the president 
to use export subsidies in the soviet sale said bushs decision 
tuesday sends a strong signal america is playing to win in the 
international marketplace 
this action is welcome news for our farmers he said 
i applaud it said rep dan glickman a kansas democrat who 
chairs the house subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grain 
but in announcing this deal the administration did not quell the 
concern about the future of the export enhancement program 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy dvt said 
he talked to the president by telephone monday night and urged him 
to approve the deal 
there should be grain sales to the soviets he said im a 
strong supporter of using the export enhancement program when it 
makes sense 
competition in the international wheat market is strong with 
many other countries using heavy subsidies to lure buyers the 
export enhancement program has been the us response to the 
competition but its future has been in doubt 
the bush administration following the lead of the reagan 
administration has called for eventual elimination of all export 
subsidies worldwide though the president has said he would not do 
away with eep unless other countries did likewise 
nevertheless no eep sales have been processed since the end of 
february and congress has been after the administration to start 
moving 
they were reacting to congressional pressure glickman said 
of the presidents announcement 
at a senate subcommittee hearing last month an agriculture 
department official said the program had been suspended pending a 
budget review 
in a letter to bush earlier this week dole said its clear 
that any budget review of the program is not an appropriate reason 
to suspend new offers at this time 
he said the agriculture department is required to use 770 
million to finance eep sales this year 
glickman said he still intends to find out what role the office 
of management and budget played in slowing down the eep program 
the fact of the matter is we are still operating under a cloud 
started by the reagan administration said glickman what i 
would have liked to have seen is a clear and unequivocal statement 
about their support for the export enhancement program 
we heard that omb was arguing against this one said sen 
robert kerrey dneb a member of the senate agriculture committee 
who has been pressuring bushs budget office for information about 
the eep slowdown 
he applauded the decision to sell to the soviets as good for the 
united states 
it also is a victory for those of us who look for ways to 
encourage the reforms that soviet president gorbachev is pushing 
for his nation he said 
the eep program involves subsidies to us exporters in the form 
of surplus governmentowned commodities the exporters are able to 
sell grain to a foreign buyer at a reduced price and then collect 
government surpluses as bonuses or subsidies to make up the 
difference 
the soviet union and china have been major buyers under the 
program with the soviets buying more than 4 million tons of us 
wheat for delivery in 198889 in addition the soviets have bought 
about 146 million unsubsidized tons of corn for 198889 
according to the agriculture department since the subsidy 
program began in 1985 it has helped sell more than 81 million tons 
of grain to all foreign recipients including about 60 million tons 
of wheat plus assorted other products such as frozen poultry eggs 
and dairy cattle in all the sales are valued at about 814 
billion with the subsidies costing more than 25 billion

attorney general dick thornburgh misstated the 
position of the american bar association when he said its judicial 
screening panel has agreed to stop considering the political and 
ideological views of candidates for the federal bench say two 
leaders of the organization 
aba president robert raven and harold r tyler jr chairman of 
the standing committee on federal judiciary both disagreed tuesday 
with thornburghs description of what has been produced by 
discussions with the attorney general about judicial screening 
the issue is sensitive because thornburghs choice to be deputy 
attorney general robert b fiske jr could face tough questioning 
by conservative senators about the job he did running the aba 
screening committee 
also there are some 50 vacancies on the federal bench 
the two aba officials said there is no agreement with the 
justice department 
tyler said the panel has only expressed a willingness in 
discussions with thornburgh to delete a clause from the guidelines 
that says political views and ideology are not considered except 
to the extent that they may bear upon the other factors 
considered by the screening panel 
i dont think we have reached any agreement on the exact 
language of any change to be made tyler said 
earlier tuesday thornburgh had told the house judiciary 
committee that the aba committee during this decade has begun 
assessing the ideological or political views of prospective 
nominees 
as a result of discussions the attorney general said the aba 
will restrict their examination and assessment only to those 
areas where they have special expertise 
we are pleased that the american bar association standing 
committee has seen fit to withdraw from an area not only 
contentious but in my view improper for their consideration that 
is to say the political and ideological views of the prospective 
nominees thornburgh told the house panel 
david runkel a special assistant to thornburgh said that he 
understood the agreement was based on an exchange of letters 
last week following personal discussions between aba leaders and 
top aides to the attorney general 
he said the aba has agreed to return to pre1979 language that 
said the committee does not attempt to investigate or report on 
political or ideological matters with respect to the prospective 
nominee 
tyler said the only letter he is aware of was one he wrote april 
4 to the attorney general summarizing their conversation that day 
fiske thornburghs choice for his deputy has not been formally 
nominated by president bush but sen gordon humphrey rnh 
charged in an april 17 letter to the president that fiske shared 
the names of prospective nominees with liberal groupsthus 
enabling those groups to target conservative candidates even before 
their nominations were made public 
at tuesdays hearing thornburgh said the agreement with the aba 
resulted through the efforts largely of robert fiske 
his remark appeared calculated to mollify humphrey and other 
conservatives 
tyler said he had discussed the issue and others with fiske but 
i didnt realize i was in any negotiation 
the aba has been accused by liberals and conservatives of 
considering political views when rating a nominees qualifications 
for the judiciary the rating is delivered during senate 
confirmation hearings 
charges from conservatives that the process was being 
politicized surfaced in 1987 after the aba committee disclosed that 
four of its 15 members dissented from a recommendation that robert 
bork was qualified to sit on the supreme court 
members of the senate judiciary committee in both political 
parties have expressed dissatisfaction with the process some 
senators have called for the aba committee to reveal the sources of 
its information about candidates and how each member voted on a 
nominee 
the supreme court is considering a legal claim that the federal 
advisory commission act requires the aba panel to meet in public 
such a requirement the aba says would inhibit its ability to 
gather information from professional peers of judicial candidates

the us cultural center in the 
provincial city of kwangju attacked 26 times by radical students 
since 1981 will be moved and temporarily closed news reports said 
today 
gerald mcloughlin said the center that he directs would close 
may 10 to move to an as yet undetermined location according to 
yonhap the south korean news agency 
but officials at the us embassy denied that the center 180 
miles southwest of seoul would close even temporarily a spokesman 
said the question of a new location was still under study in 
washington 
us officials have been considering a move since early this 
year after repeated attacks by radical students yelling antius 
slogans and hurling firebombs and rocks 
antius sentiment is relatively high in kwangju because of the 
bloody military suppression of prodemocracy civil uprising there 
in may 1980 about 200 people were killed and more than 1000 
others injured in the nineday uprising 
many opposition and dissident figures claim the united states 
shares responsibility for the bloodshed by acquiescing to a south 
korean government plan to ruthlessly quell the uprising 
the united states denies the charges

abc says it didnt broadcast a special featuring 
reenactments of reallife crimes of passion because there were no 
advertisers 
an abc executive said the lack of advertising reflected 
corporate concerns about public opposition to sex and violence on 
television 
the show crimes of passion ii had no advertisers as of the 
day before its scheduled saturday broadcast the network said 
tuesday abc said in the best interests of the network and its 
affiliates the show was replaced with two 1988 comedy pilots 
it happened because there is a sensitivity on the part of 
advertisers to programs of this nature said ted harbert senior 
vice president of programming for abc thats clear thats 
obvious and thats growing 
executives at several major advertising agencies said they could 
not recall any previous network program that had failed to attract 
advertising and was removed from the schedule 
a press release for the special whose host was actor bruce 
dern said it explores reallife cases in which people have 
committed an act of violence aimed against someone they love the 
program included two stabbings a shooting and an incident in which 
a man set fire to his wife 
the first crimes of passion was broadcast in october and 
garnered a 132 rating and 23 share in the wednesday time period 
now occupied by china beach by comparison china beach had 
a 122 rating and 21 share last week according to the ac nielsen 
co the rating is a percentage of the nations 904 million 
households with televisions the share is a percentage of sets in 
use 
though crimes of passion did reasonably well in the ratings 
last fall it was in a better time period than crimes of passion 
ii it would have been broadcast on saturday night when abcs 
ratings are much lower livin large and heart and soul 
the replacement shows were among last weeks lowestrated shows 
had the show run without any paid advertising it would not be 
rated by nielsen and that would have hurt the networks affiliated 
stations during the may sweeps period when the ratings are used to 
determine local advertising rates 
earlier this season advertisers pulled out of nbcs geraldo 
rivera highrated special on devil worship and others backed off 
nbcs satirical saturday night live a michigan womans 
campaign against foxs raunchy married with children 
received publicity earlier this year fox says the relatively

the oneday boycott of exxon products around the country is the 
start of a war of words and actions against the nations 
largest oil company over its huge alaskan spill environmentalists 
and politicians say 
the campaign tuesday met with mixed results in scattered cities 
and dissents from independent service stations who say theyre 
victims of the spill too 
i just think the end result is not going to be to hurt the 
people who are responsible said evan jaeger who manages an 
exxon station in elmwood park nj its going to hurt the little 
guy trying to make a living 
exxon issued a statement calling the boycott unjust and a 
company executive defended the cleanup of the spill 
we cannot undo what happened said exxon usa president 
william d stevens in houston however we can and we are 
taking every possible action to limit the damage clean up the 
mess and otherwise mitigate the impacts 
but consumer activist ralph nader said exxon should not be 
allowed to forget the nations worst oil spill and that a boycott 
was the way to send a message to the oil giant 
nader joined representatives from several environmental and 
consumer groups in accusing exxon of failing to be prepared for the 
spill and not rapidly responding to the accident that has fouled 
hundreds of miles of alaskas coast 
americans can take action now by voting with their steering 
wheel and dollars against all exxon products nader said in 
washington 
exxon spokeswoman sarah johnson said 10000 credit cards out of 
7 million have been returned to the company since the march 24th 
spill 
exxon said it had received no reports from dealers of a loss in 
volume of gasoline sold as a result of the creditcard return or 
from boycotts 
only about 5 percent or 620 of the 12400 exxon brand stations 
in the united states are owned and operated by the company the 
rest are independent 
j edward surette jr executive director of the bay state 
gasoline retailers association in billerica mass said his group 
did a statewide survey of dealers tuesday but it was too early to 
assess the impact of the boycott 
the exxon dealer had no more to do with that oil spill than 
the barber who last cut your hair said surette saying it was 
unfair for consumers to vent their anger at dealers 
rallies supporting the boycott were held in portland ore 
boston and anchorage where about 400 chanting and signwaving 
protesters rallied in front of exxons alaska headquarters 
we are beginning the war of words and actions against any oil 
company that doesnt understand its responsibility to protect the 
environment declared state sen carol amick lead organizer of 
the boycott movement in massachusetts 
in portland more than 100 people rallied in the shadow of 
alaskan oil tankers being repaired at the shipyard where the 
ruptured exxon valdez is scheduled to be inspected next month 
in eugene ore three dozen protesters picketed an exxon 
gasoline station chanting such things as cut the card save the 
earth 
we need to show exxon that massive environmental destruction 
is more than just bad public relations it is bad business marc 
osten of the state public interest research group said in 
portland we must boycott them until the gulf of alaska is clean 
until innocent victims are compensated and until we are assured 
that this will never happen again 
the alaskan spill and an explosion at a north sea oil rig have 
heightened concerns over gasoline supplies for the summers peak 
driving season crude oil prices have risen more than 7 a barrel 
since january 
since the accident gasoline prices have increased an average 10 
percent nationally while the pacific northwest saw surges as high 
as 25 percent in less than a month said marla rae executive 
assistant to oregon attorney general dave frohnmayer 
the rise in prices since the spill prompted calls for a federal 
investigation from frohnmayer and state attorneys general in 
washington idaho and utah and us senators from nebraska

a spill of 100000 gallons of sewage into a 
flood control channel triggered a precautionary closure of 3 miles 
of beaches as waste trapped behind sandbag dams was pumped back 
into sewers 
results of water samples from the beaches were due today said 
toby staheli spokeswoman for the los angeles county department of 
health services we dont know what if anything got into the 
ocean she said 
beaches were closed tuesday from the venice pier south to 
dockweiler state beach 
the 100000 gallons of sewage spilled when a power outage shut 
down a pumping station in inglewood on monday night said don 
avila a sanitation districts spokesman 
sewage flowed out of manholes for almost an hour until portable 
generators put the plant back in operation he said 
the waste went into centinela creek but a sandbag dam was 
constructed in the channel to keep it from getting into ballona 
creek which flows into the ocean 
avila said about 1000 gallons of waste may have gotten through 
the sandbags but it was chlorinated as it passed through

ten years ago today an election swept prime 
minister margaret thatcher to power and she continues to prevail 
over a divided opposition despite a recent poll indicating a lot of 
voters are fed up with her 
there was no word today from 10 downing st of any special 
events to mark the anniversary which television radio newspapers 
and magazines have marked with numerous programs and articles in 
recent weeks 
mrs thatcher 63 is the centurys longest continuously serving 
british prime minister and the headquarters of her conservative 
party has printed a glossy booklet called the first 10 years 
glowing with praise for her 
she is now midway through her third term following conservative 
victories in the 1983 and 1987 general elections despite 
indications of growing dislike among many voters of her 
strongwilled personality and rightwing policies she has said she 
plans to try for a fourth term 
a series of polls released this week indicate most britons want 
mrs thatcher to step down soon and think her rightwing revolution 
has gone too far 
but while they said they dont like her the likelihood is they 
will go on voting for her because they respect the woman who has 
always led what the economist weekly calls a reluctant nation 
the economist noted for example that virtually throughout mrs 
thatchers tenure gallup soundings have never registered more than 
24 percent support for a basic thatcher doctrine tax cuts rather 
than increased state spending particularly on welfare 
the soundings published sunday and tuesday are part of a 
nationwide assessment of thatcherism prompted by the 
anniversary of the conservative partys 1979 election triumph over 
prime minister james callaghans labor party government 
mrs thatcher took office the following day may 4 europes 
first woman prime minister had been elected by a nation weary of 
strikes and inflation and yearning for strong government to reverse 
national decline 
in the opinion polls she scored high for qualities such as 
determination and courage her most popular policies the polls 
showed are curbing the trade unions and allowing public housing 
tenants to buy their homes 
britons see their country as having gained respect abroad while 
becoming a more aggressive violent and selfish society 
a leader who set out to wipe out socialism from britain mrs 
thatcher also appears in most soundings to be presiding over a 
nation that has not taken her message to its heart 
a market and opinion research international poll published 
tuesday in the independent a london daily showed only 30 percent 
support for the notion that private interests and a free market 
economy should dominate 
according to a harris poll in londons liberal observer 
newspaper 58 percent think 10 years of mrs thatcher is enough 
and 66 percent agreed with the statement mrs thatcher has gone 
too far in her policies 
but just 7 percent of the 1040 voters questioned by harris 
actually expected mrs thatcher to resign within the next few years 
the soundings also showed a generally subdued reckoning by 
voters of the thatcher revolution for example just 37 percent of 
the 1001 voters questioned by gallup for the conservative sunday 
telegraph said they thought that overall britain is now a better 
place to live in 
and while 67 percent dislike mrs thatcher personally 63 
percent respect her 
the polls also showed most britons think the country has become 
more violent citing soccer hooliganism and street crime 
mrs thatcher who has won big majorities of around 42 percent 
of the vote while the leftofcenter is split continues to be the 
party leader most think would be the best prime minister and when 
it comes to casting a vote she ends the first 10 years with 2 to 3 
point lead over labor in most soundings

ah its spring again and college students fancies are turning 
to protests even as final exams loom 
in at least four states echoes of the 60s could be heard as 
students took aim at proposed budget cuts tuition increases and 
union recognition 
and at a prestigious college student protests culminated in 
getting cocacola products banned 
thousands of protesting city university of new york students 
skipped classes tuesday and marched through lower manhattan as a 
deadline approached on a state spending bill that would reduce 
money for higher education and force a tuition increase hours 
later gov mario cuomo vetoed the bill 
at the university of california berkeley teaching and research 
assistants planned to begin a twoday walkout today and picket 
campus entrances to protest the schools refusal to recognize their 
union 
mount holyoke college administrators in south hadley mass 
under pressure from students to boycott cocacola products because 
of the companys ties to south africa announced a monthlong ban of 
the companys soft drinks 
in new york about 4000 students stepped up protests that began 
last week 
placardcarrying chanting students from the university system 
assembled in front of the world trade center where cuomos new 
york office is located they blocked traffic for several hours 
then paraded past city hall and to the wall street financial 
district 
its not just a matter of this tuition hike if we let them 
go it will be more said armando howard a 29yearold physics 
student it will cut out the opportunity for people to rise 
cuomo had given no indication what his decision would be but 
one hour before the midnight deadline he vetoed it saying 
university officials had failed to prove the need for the extra 
money 
at berkeley neither the 3200member association of graduate 
student employees nor university officials would predict how many 
assistants would join todays walkout 
so far our indications are that this could be more symbolic 
than a significant disruption said university spokesman tom 
debley 
the dispute is over the universitys view that the assistants 
work cannot be considered employment because it is so intertwined 
with educational experience said debley assistants receive annual 
stipends from the university or research institutions averaging 
about 10000 
the association has been seeking recognition since 1983 as a 
union so it can negotiate better pay and benefits and improved 
working conditions but the public employment relations board 
recently ruled students do not have to be considered employees for 
the purposes of collective bargaining 
the association is appealing the decision 
in ohio a twoday commemoration was to begin tonight at kent 
state university to mark the may 4 1970 shooting deaths of four 
students by national guardsmen during an antivietnam war 
demonstration 
at mount holyoke a memo to students today outlined immediate 
steps to replace cocacola products with beverages from companies 
with little or no business interests in south africa 
the decision came tuesday after 60 protesters shouted anticoke 
slogans outside school president elizabeth kennans office and 
chased a coke delivery truck down the street 
students have pressed administrators for two months to remove 
cocacola products because they say the company is reaping 
profits that benefit whiteruled south africa 
i think its a monumental step i think it shows some 
responsibility on the part of the administration in terms of 
listening to students said kuhusu wanzu of the the american 
friends service committee in atlanta the quaker group that has 
tried to organize boycotts at several campuses 
a cocacola spokesman in atlanta called the students misguided 
and quoted from a letter by south africas anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu an antiapartheid leader 
i am sorry to hear that cocacola is being accused of 
aiding and abetting the apartheid regime tutu said in the april 
10 letter according to cocacola spokesman mark preisinger 
nothing could be further from the truth 
tutu continued it is easy to sound more radical from the safe 
and comfortable distance of 10000 miles than those who bear the 
brunt of the viciousness of the apartheid machinery close at hand

a great horned owl swooped down and 
scratched the face of a 6yearold boy riding a bicycle and 
doctors fear he may lose his left eye 
tyler tharp underwent several hours of surgery at university 
hospitals in iowa city after fridays attack and doctors told his 
family a decision will be made this week whether they can save the 
eye 
the youngster was listed in fair condition tuesday 
a family friend jean oberholser said tyler was riding his bike 
near his home in lowden an eastern iowa town of 700 people when 
the owl struck 
the owl hit him right in the face and a talon hit him directly 
in the eye ms oberholser said it made a tshaped cut 
originally i dont think anyone thought they could save the eye 
but yesterday they said he could see light through it 
craig jackson of the iowa department of natural resources said 
the attack probably was made by a female owl protecting her young 
we cant verify it but we assume there was a baby owl on the 
ground when the youngster went by on the sidewalk he said 
whenever young are around animals become very protective but 
ive never heard of great horned owls attacking someone to this 
extent 
jackson said authorities destroyed both owl parents not knowing 
which one attacked and fearing the bird might attack again he also 
said officials were forced to destroy the offspring 
great horned owls named for their large ear tufts are 
protected birds but are not considered endangered or threatened

a locomotive missing for more than 100 years in 
eastern colorado has been found but not by the 300 volunteers who 
searched for it in january with magnetometers and frontend loaders 
it turns out the train was recovered months after it was buried 
by a flood said craig dirgo spokesman for the national underwater 
and marine agency a private organization that sponsored the search 
the train isnt out there said dirgo it was dug up at 
the end of august 1878 by a second search party the initial search 
party quit 
we know it was taken to armstrong kansas near kansas city 
and was rebuilt 
the engines ultimate fate however remains a mystery 
last january bestselling author clive cussler who founded the 
agency dirgo and 300 volunteers used magnetometers and frontend 
loaders to search a dry river bottom outside of bennett 30 miles 
east of denver hoping to find the missing kansaspacific railroad 
locomotive 
but that hunt and another involving about 25 people the 
following weekend failed to turn up any sign of the train 
the engine 19 cars and a caboose fell 30 feet from a bridge the 
night of may 21 1878 when a flood struck the area 
twelve cars and the locomotive were reported to have been buried 
in the sand the front brakeman fireman and engineer were killed 
the engineers body was found about 10 miles downriver 
cussler who wrote the book raise the titanic and lives in 
golden has located 54 sunken vessels through his organization his 
book night probe was written with the missing locomotive in 
mind 
but on monday cussler learned that the engine had been raised 
more than 110 years ago 
a friend don snoddy of omaha neb found the information from 
documents at a union pacific museum union pacific bought kansas 
pacific sometime after the flood 
the documents snoddy found indicated the locomotive was removed 
from the river bed in the middle of the night in august 1878 dirgo 
said it was rebuilt two years later and received a new number in 
1885 
weve been trying to figure out why it was covered up dirgo 
said it was removed late at night and they denied for years 
that it was uncovered 
dirgo said he and cussler originally thought the locomotives 
recovery might have been part of an insurance fraud because kansas 
pacific had been in financial straits at the time of the flood and 
the engine was valued at 18000 but that theory didnt seem 
right he said 
i dont think it was insurance fraud dirgo said in 
talking to everybody they didnt really have insurance back then 
many bennett residents including 79yearold emma mitchell 
whose father worked on the cleanup following the flood had 
staunchly believed the locomotive remained in a sandy grave 
how they tricked an entire town for a hundred years dirgo 
wondered

president najib says afghanistan is in 
danger of becoming a second lebanon and has urged the west to 
help end the war between his sovietbacked government and 
usarmed moslem guerrillas 
it is in the interest of the west to ensure and maintain peace 
and to establish a broadbased government through a multiparty 
system not through attempts to bring to power a small extremist 
fanatical group najib said tuesday 
speaking to foreign reporters during an hourlong news conference 
at the foreign ministry najib said western countries should 
embrace a new spirit of detente and do their utmost to help 
reach a political settlement 
najib spoke after the united states spurned his governments 
repeated calls for direct talks washington supplies most of the 
weapons to moslem guerrillas fighting to overthrow najibs marxist 
regime 
the united states and its allies say they will not deal with a 
government installed by moscow 
najib suggested that more fighting could turn afghanistan into a 
second lebanon a reference to the sectarian battles that have 
wrought havoc in beirut for 14 years 
the west must decide who the united states is aligning itself 
with a band of cutthroats just look at beautiful jalalabad 
najib said through a translator 
he said the rebels are firing between 2000 and 3000 rockets 
every day into the eastern city 40 miles from the pakistani border 
in islamabad pakistan the rebel afghan news agency said the 
guerrillas killed at least 35 soldiers captured 37 destroyed 
eight tanks and captured two others since sunday in fighting south 
of jalalabad 
pakistanibased guerrillas began attacking the city three weeks 
after soviet forces on feb 15 ended nine years of involvement in 
the civil war that began after an april 1978 communist coup 
after initial gains by the rebels the battle for jalalabad 
appears to have settled into a stalemate with casualties believed 
to number in the thousands on both sides 
the capture of jalalabad would give the insurgents a badly 
needed victory to bolster their predictions that afghanistans 
marxist rulers would fall soon after soviet soldiers left 
gulbaddin hekmatyar a fundamentalist faction leader who serves 
as foreign minister of the guerrillas selfproclaimed government 
called on the soviet union also to stop arming the afghan 
communists 
his written statement distributed tuesday said an end to 
soviet military aid would enable the real representative of the 
afghan nation to assume power in order to hold elections of a 
representative government which will work to normalize future 
relations between afghanistan and the soviet union 
in his remarks najib claimed that 65000 rebels had agreed to 
stop fighting but he gave no details 
soviet forces entered afghanistan in 1979 to help the communist 
government battle the rebels more than 100000 troops were in the 
country when the soviets signed a unsponsored agreement in april 
1988 to withdraw

investigators trying to solve the second 
reported baby abduction from the same family in three years have 
released a cryptic bit of information about the likely but so far 
unknown suspect 
police sgt rick mccain said the fbis national center for 
analysis of violent crime came up with a psychological profile of 
the person responsible 
weve been led to believe that the perpetrator will suffer 
severe anxiety as time passes mccain said and this will be 
manifested in behavior the subject will be unable to control its 
my feeling that it will make this person known to police 
mccain the departments chief of detectives refused to 
elaborate on what kind of behavior might be expected or how 
investigators might spot it 
and he refused to say why police released that part of the 
report 
mccain said police still had hopes for the safe return of 
6weekold heather sims whose parents robert and paula sims said 
she was abducted by a masked armed intruder at their home saturday 
night 
he said investigators have found no evidence disproving the 
parents story that for the second time in three years a masked 
gunman abducted their baby daughter 
theres nothing to indicate that the sims are anything but 
victims at this time mccain said 
their 13dayold daughter loralei disappeared under almost 
identical circumstances in 1986 
loraleis body was found five days later about 150 feet from 
the couples home in brighton no cause of death was determined and 
no arrest was made in the case although investigators at the time 
said the parents were suspects 
dr janis robinson a pediatrician who examined heather on april 
22 said the baby had been in good health and there was nothing 
unusual in the way mrs sims had handled her 
detectives returned to the simses neighborhood tuesday asking 
neighbors whether they had seen or heard anything that could help 
we havent found anyone who saw the alleged assailant but 
that doesnt mean there wasnt one mccain said 
the simses have refused to talk to reporters

officials in the marcos familys 
hometown have a day of mourning for thursdays first 
anniversary of the death of ferdinand marcos mother whose body 
still lies in an open casket 
the marcoses refuse to bury josefa edralinmarcos who died may 
4 1988 until president corazon aquino allows her deposed 
predecessor to return from hawaiian exile for the funeral 
theres no indication the 95yearold womans body will be 
buried anytime soon 
jesus nalupta mayor of this town of about 40000 people that is 
250 miles north of manila said today that the municipal council 
declared the day of mourning because everybody is still 
grieving 
but he said no special ceremonies were scheduled apart from 
roman catholic masses which have been said nearly every day since 
mrs edralinmarcos body was brought last year from manila where 
she died 
her body has been lying in an open casket in the marcos 
ancestral home which has been turned into a museum 
the wake has attracted an unusual assortment of marcos 
supporters tourists curiosityseekers and a cult of religious 
fanatics who believe marcos is the second son of god 
mrs aquino has cited national security in refusing to allow 
marcos to return from hawaii where he has lived since he was 
ousted in a popular uprising three years ago 
marcos has been hospitalized since january with heart and 
bronchial ailments and his followers say he is dying 
nalupta and many others here in marcos home province of ilocos 
norte believe the former president should be allowed to return 
both to bury his mother and die in his homeland 
we have given up all hopes that the aquino government would 
allow marcos to come home said congressman mariano nalupta a 
brother of the mayor we have given it to the will of god 
frank malabed the marcos familys mortician said it has cost 
the former presidents family about 950 a month to continue the 
wake including charges for flowers embalming supplies and changes 
in clothing 
malabed said he inspects the body periodically and adds more 
embalming fluid every two months he said the lengthy highly 
publicized wake has been great for his business

physicists are resorting to poems and visual 
aids like a blade of grass to help illustrate the problems they 
found in two chemists claim of achieving nuclear fusion in a jar 
tens of millions of dollars are at stake dear sister and 
brother because one scientist put a thermometer in one place 
instead of the other walter meyerhof of stanford university 
recited to reporters tuesday at a meeting of the american physical 
society 
meyerhof said the excess heat that the researchers attribute to 
cold fusion was caused instead by incorrect temperature 
measurements he said the device the researchers used failed to 
distribute temperature evenly 
university of utah chemist b stanley pons and his collaborator 
martin fleischmann of britains university of southampton startled 
the world march 23 by announcing they had achieved fusion at room 
temperature 
most efforts to achieve fusion the nuclear reaction that powers 
the sun have required staggeringly high temperatures cold fusion 
could open the door to a clean cheap and virtually unlimited 
source of energy 
pons and fleischmann said they did it by placing palladium and 
platinum electrodes in a flask of deuterium oxide or heavy water 
and applying electric current deuterium is a heavier isotope or 
cousin of ordinary hydrogen 
the researchers claimed the nuclei of the deuterium atoms fused 
releasing neutrons and producing four times more heat than invested 
but in an informal show of hands the scientists on a panel at 
the american physical society meeting tuesday voted 81 that they 
were 95 percent confident the excess heat was not produced by 
nuclear fusion 
however the panel also voted 63 against ruling out that 
experiments in utah and elsewhere had produced neutrons 
the bottom line is we see nothing anomalous in any of their 
experiments and have identified what we believe are serious errors 
in the experiment said steven koonin of the california institute 
of technology 
koonin was part of a threemember caltech team that tried to 
duplicate the utah experiments 
fred skiff a university of maryland physicist said that after 
attempting to duplicate the results for two weeks he was certain 
cold fusion had not taken place 
it appears the work by pons and fleischmann is very sloppy 
skiff said they should have presented their research in the 
scientific community before going public with it he said the 
public debate on this matter makes science look bad because of the 
complicated process of verification 
one of the few physicists to hold out hope for cold fusion 
brigham young universitys steve jones said his experiments had 
produced neutrons but at a level much lower than the university of 
utah experiment claimed cold fusion needs further study but is 
only a little understood effect he said 
he used a blade of grass to illustrate his point 
i dont think it will grow into a tree jones said i 
think it will grow into a pleasant little flower in the garden of 
physics 
pons and fleishmann have not responded in detail to this weeks 
criticism in baltimore 
but pons did say the absence of neutrons does not concern us 
in the slightest we couldnt be happier we and other scientists 
will soon tell them why this is so 
university of utah officials also defended the research 
its difficult for me to believe people of pons and 
fleischmanns caliber could forget to put a thermometer in the 
right place or something basic like stirring said john brophy 
the universitys vice president for research it doesnt shake my 
confidence its never nice to be criticized however when youre 
out in front the wind can be cool sometimes

in the first verdict dealing with 
the carriers liability a jury cleared delta air lines in the 1985 
crash of flight 191 that killed 137 people at dallasfort worth 
international airport 
a federal jury decided tuesday that the carrier wasnt 
responsible for the crash because the planes crew was unaware of 
deadly wind shear before landing 
this confirms our belief that neither delta nor its pilots 
caused the accident and shows that the pilots were not aware of the 
dangerous storm they were flying into the atlantabased airline 
said in a statement 
other juries around the nation have ordered damage awards to 
flight 191s survivors and families of some of the 137 people who 
died in the crash but only the value of lives not the question of 
liability was at issue 
the suit that led to tuesdays judgment was brought by the 
family of sidney bernstein 40 of fort lauderdale who was killed 
when the lockheed l1011 jet en route from fort 
lauderdalehollywood international airport to los angeles crashed 
during a violent thunderstorm on aug 2 1985 
for delta the verdict strengthened its hopes in other cases 
pending nationwide that are trying to establish that the company 
was at fault 
tuesdays verdict also could affect a lawsuit brought by delta 
in fort worth against the federal government 
delta has claimed in its suit that meteorologists and 
airtraffic controllers failed to inform the crew of the worsening 
weather and wants the government to pay all or part of the claims 
facing the airline 
the national transportation safety board has blamed the crash on 
a microburst a violent downward blast of air often associated with 
severe thunderstorms 
the nonjury trial in fort worth ended last week us district 
judge david belew has said he may not rule for months on who was to 
blame for the crash 
delta and its insurance companies already have paid more than 
66 million in death injury and damage claims from the flight 191 
crash and the total is expected to exceed 100 million 
in those cases survivors who brought lawsuits against delta and 
its insurance companies have waived the question of liability 
bernsteins family wanted delta to admit responsibility for the 
crash and to pay damages to the family for lost wages he would have 
provided had he lived the jurys verdict resulted in no damages 
being awarded 
the familys attorney stephen walker argued during the trial 
that the planes pilot willfully and intentionally flew into 
the thunderstorm that caused the crash 
but delta attorney howard barwick said key evidence in the trial 
came from a private pilot who landed at the dallasfort worth 
airport seconds before the delta jet crashed 
he said he was trapped and he had no indication of the 
conditions he was flying into barwick said the flight crews 
were completely taken by surprise i think the jury agreed with us 
that delta and its crew were victims just like mr bernstein

jewish emigration from the soviet union in april 
soared to its highest level in 10 years according to figures 
released today by an agency that helps to resettle the emigrants 
however the share of those bound for israel fell to a new low 
regina boucault spokeswoman of the genevabased 
intergovernmental committee for migration said 4129 jews arrived 
at the vienna transit center from the soviet union in april 
compared with 3893 in march 
only 87 of them or 21 percent said they wanted to go to 
israel most were heading for the united states said ms boucault 
last year the share of soviet jews bound for israel was still 
71 percent in 1987 before the palestinian uprising in the west 
bank and the gaza strip it was as high as 244 percent 
since the beginning of 1989 12864 jews have left the soviet 
union according to icm figures 
on tuesday the washingtonbased national conference on soviet 
jewry reported an emigration total of 4557 jews for april the icm 
figures only account for those soviet jews who pass through vienna 
the program for jewish emigration from soviet union began in 
1971 and reached a peak in 1979 when 51328 were allowed to leave 
the country this dropped sharply when soviet intervention in 
afghanistan chilled eastwest relations

disagreement over a 
multibilliondollar plan to clean up the countrys environment has 
brought down the 7yearold centerright government of prime 
minister ruud lubbers 
the christian democrat on tuesday announced the resignation of 
his cabinet after a rightwing junior partner objected to his 
proposal to end 325 million in income tax deductions for people 
who drive their cars to work 
political observers predicted lubbers would form a coalition 
with the dutch labor party second only to the christian democrats 
in the number of parliamentary seats it holds 
lubbers action headed off a possible motion of no confidence 
threatened by the junior coalition partner the peoples party for 
freedom and democracy 
environmental policy certainly needs to be paid for but why 
just by those who live at some distance from their jobs said 
joris voorhoeve the rightwing partys leader in the 150seat 
parliament 
lubbers announcement came at the end of a tense 7hour 
parliamentary debate on a 365 billion government plan to cut 
pollution of the countrys atmosphere to 30 percent of current 
levels by the year 2010 
if only we could motivate one in ten cardriving commuters 
to change their habits that would have a very large effect on 
the congestion on mobility on the environment lubbers said 
the crisis also reflected years of irritation among voorhoeves 
party at steadily losing decisionmaking power to the charismatic 
lubbers who enjoys immense popularity in this nation of 146 
million people 
the 49yearold prime minister said he planned to meet with 
queen beatrix today to offer the resignation of all the 
ministers in the cabinet 
in dutch constitutional practice the government will continue 
in office with caretaker status until early elections later this 
year after the elections it can take several months until a new 
government is formed 
parliamentary elections had been scheduled for may 1990 
the christian democrats have been in virtually every postwar 
dutch government and are likely to be the centerpiece of the next 
one 
never in postwar dutch history has a political party garnered 
sufficient votes to govern alone 
the 8yearold lubbers government has aimed to cut the 13 
billion budget deficit and 11 percent unemployment rate 
in recent months the peoples party has accused lubbers party 
of backing off from a pledge to cut corporate and private taxes and 
slash social security education and health care outlays 
but the issue that prompted the governments resignation was a 
lubbers proposal to end the tax break for cardriving commuters in 
a bid to reduce car exhaust fumes and highway congestion by forcing 
motorists to take mass transit voorhoeve also objected to a 
proposed 270 million increase in the tax on diesel fuel that would 
mainly hit the trucking industry one of the mainstays of the dutch 
economy 
under the antipollution plan farmers also would have to pay 
toward cleaning up deposits of manure produced by their livestock 
deposits that contribute to acid rain 
the plan would set levies for polluting industries and contain 
proposals for cleaning up hundreds of toxic waste dumps 
voorhoeves move to topple the government had the support of the 
52seat labor party opposition and the 54 christian democrats 
would not have been able to hold off a noconfidence vote 
the peoples party has 27 seats in parliament while 12 seats 
are held by three opposition parties and five seats by three 
rightwing parties that are generally supportive of the government

if the vietnamese troop pullout from 
cambodia is independently confirmed and the constitution rewritten 
to his satisfaction prince norodom sihanouk says he will return 
home as head of state 
sihanouk leader of the guerrilla coalition resisting the 
vietnamesebacked government said today that he expects to decide 
before november if his conditions have been met 
he made the comments at a news conference on the second day of 
peace talks in jakarta 
an international commission to be named at a conference in 
paris on july 2425 must first make sure the vietnamese withdrawal 
is genuine sihanouk said hanoi has promised to pull out its 
remaining troops by sept 30 
sihanouks other demands include a fourparty interim government 
in phnom penh until elections can be held and constitutional 
guarantees for a multiparty political system 
the proposed interim administration would include the present 
cambodian government of premier hun sen sihanouks noncommunist 
followers anticommunists from former premier son sanns khmer 
peoples national liberation front and the communist khmer rouge 
hun sen has been trying to persuade sihanouk to abandon the 
khmer rouge and return home as head of the the government he headed 
until being ousted in 1970 
the khmer rouge which came to power in 1975 and was forced out 
by the invading vietnamese in 1978 is not represented at the 
talks sihanouk said no support could be expected from them 
following the jakarta talks 
the khmer rouge will reject everything because they are 
interested in the continuation of the war he said 
the fanatical khmer rouge is accused of killing hundreds of 
thousands of people during its bloody reign hun sen sihanouk and 
their allies insist that pol pot and other leaders of the original 
genocidal clique be barred from any future government 
the khmer rouge the largest cambodian guerrilla group today 
rejected any conciliatory moves by the vietnameseinstalled 
government saying they should be thrown into the dustbin 
the khmer rouge radio was commenting on the constitutional 
amendments the provietnamese government adopted sunday 
in concessions to sihanouk hun sen had changed the countrys 
name from peoples republic of kampuchea to the state of cambodia 
as well as changed its flag and anthem and promised several changes 
to the constitution 
these are merely part of efforts to legitimize the regime the 
khmer rouge broadcast said a text of tuesdays broadcast was 
obtained today in bangkok 
the radio complained that the government had changed its outer 
shell but the true nature remains a vietnamese puppet socialist 
regime 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said tuesday that close ties with a future cambodian government 
would not be possible if it were heavily influenced by the khmer 
rouge 
sihanouk said the sinosoviet summit in beijing in midmay 
should be beneficial to his cause 
he said soviet president mikhail s gorbachev may put some 
moral pressure on hun sen and the chinese leadership might apply 
pressure on the khmer rouge to seek a settlement in the 10yearold 
conflict 
china is the primary military backer of the khmer rouge

colleagues of slain 
antiapartheid activist david webster today offered a reward for 
the arrest of his killers and advised police officials to look 
within their own ranks for suspects 
webster a university lecturer and outspoken critic of the 
governments policy of detention without trial was shot outside 
his home monday by an assailant in a passing car who fired a 
shotgun from close range 
also today six mortar bombs were fired at an army radar 
installation near the border with botswana damaging living 
quarters but causing no injuries 
regarding webster police have released sketches of three 
unidentified white men suspected of involvement in the killing and 
have offered a 4000 reward for information leading to arrests 
today the university of the witwatersand where webster taught 
anthropology offered an additional 4000 reward robert 
charleton the chief administrator of the multiracial university 
said it was deeply disquieting that police had made no arrests 
in connection with a series of previous attacks and vandalism aimed 
at staff and students 
antiapartheid activists who worked with webster announced at a 
news conference that his funeral would held saturday 
max coleman a prominent human rights advocate called for an 
investigation into the possible existence of death squads formed to 
kill government opponents 
there may be no more profitable place to start such an 
investigation than within the ranks of the police themselves 
coleman said this is the body which has the expertise the 
information and the wherewithal to carry out such acts so 
professionally 
mohammed valli moosa a leader of the banned united democratic 
front antiapartheid coalition told the news conference that 
webster was a very carefully chosen target 
his coldblooded murder is meant to serve as a warning to the 
increasing numbers of whites who are daring to associate themselves 
in word and deed with the oppressed people of this country valli 
moosa said we fear that more and more of our leaders are going 
to be assassinated 
the ordinary people of this country have a strong suspicion 
that comrade websters assassin is a member of the police force 
he added 
webster was an authority on the tactics used legally and 
illegally to repress or intimidate government opponents he 
recently completed an article discussing unsolved abductions and 
assassinations of antiapartheid activists 
numerous black activists have been slain in recent years many 
white activists have received anonymous threats or have been 
harassed but few have been attacked since the unsolved 1978 killing 
of rick turner a political scientist at the university of natal 
in northcentral south africa security forces set off a land 
mine while trying to catch those who fired the mortar bombs at the 
radar installation but the detonation of the mine caused no 
injuries the military said 
it said the radar installation was near mafikeng near the 
botswana border 
there was no immediate indication who was responsible 
there have been few attacks on army bases and very few mortar 
bombardments during the 28yearold guerrilla campaign waged by the 
outlawed african national congress south african officials have 
contended that anc guerrillas often infiltrate from botswana to 
carry out bombing and sabotage missions

plo chairman yasser arafats 
representative to lebanon remained in a coma today but was reported 
in stable condition a day after being shot in the head by a masked 
gunman

killed today as he drove his motorcycle down a main street in 
sidon bassam hourani 30 died instantly from several shot 
wounds in the head and chest said a police spokesman the gunman 
escaped 
a spokesman at hammoud hospital said arafats representative 
48yearold issam salem survived a fivehour operation to remove a 
bullet that pierced the left side of his forehead in an 
assassination attempt tuesday 
the operation was a success mr salem is in stable condition 
but still in coma however we wont know if we can take him off 
the critical list for at least 48 hours the spokesman said he 
declined to be named 
salem was the second highranking plo official to become the 
target of an assassination attempt in sidon within four days 
police said a lone assailant wearing a plastic mask and armed 
with a 9mm pistol fired two bullets into salems head and shoulder 
at a gift store in this port citys fakhreddin street

palestinian refugee camp of ein elhilweh on sidons southern 
flank according to police

the nasserite leftist moslem militia that governs sidon said they 
launched a joint hunt for the gunman but spokesmen for both groups 
said no arrests were made 
there was no claim of responsibility for the attempt against 
salem or the rocketpropelled grenade attack saturday on the house 
of zeid wehbi the plo spokesman in sidon 
arafat on an official visit in france called the attack on 
salem a message for us to put up our hands and stop helping our 
lebanese brothers 
that was interpreted by christiancontrolled radio stations in 
beirut as an accusation against syria whose forces have been 
locked in heavy artillery duels with christian units of the 
lebanese army in the past seven weeks 
wehbi however blamed israels secret service 
he told reporters the attack was designed to deal a blow to 
lebanesepalestinian coexistence in the sidon region 
wehbi charged israel is launching a wave of assassination 
attempts against our brethren 
arafat a staunch foe of syrian president hafez assad had 
declared support for the christians in the latest round of 
lebanons 14yearold civil war that has claimed almost 300 lives 
but arafats estimated 5000 guerrillas who have returned to the 
sidon region after his evacuation from lebanon during israels 1982 
invasion have taken no active part in the fighting

about 200 young people attacked stores and 
restaurants following may day celebrations in the central asia 
republic of turkmenia and police arrested 100 of them to end the 
rampage pravda said today 
those who were detained said they acted because of exorbitant 
prices of cooperatives and the low quality of products and 
services pravda said but as a method of protest as was seen 
they chose hooliganism 
about 200 young people gathered in ashkabad the capital of 
turkmenia on monday evening after may day celebrations and began 
attacking stores parks and restaurants they broke glass and 
damaged some cars pravda said turkmenia is a southern soviet 
republic bordering the caspian sea iran and afghanistan 
the crowd was led by criminals the communist party newspaper 
charged police resorted to force after the youths ignored an order 
to disperse not less than 100 lawbreakers were detained and no 
one was hurt pravda said 
it quoted interior minister vasily grinin of turkmenia as saying 
that police had heard rumors there would be trouble but that they 
managed to break it up without using tear gas or truncheons 
the papers specific reference to tear gas and truncheons 
apparently was intended to assure readers that there was no repeat 
of the violent clash between demonstrators and soldiers in the 
georgian republic on april 9 
soldiers there waded into a crowd of proindependence 
demonstrators with clubs and shovels and used gas to disperse 
them nineteen people were killed and one more young man was shot 
to death later for violating curfew 
there have been no reports of any previous such trouble in 
turkmenia a republic of 35 million people the most sparsely 
populated of the five traditionally moslem central asian republics 
there have been reports of religious and civil unrest in 
neighboring uzbekistan and kazakhstan 
pravda said ashkabad has remained quite since the unrest was 
quelled 
cooperatives are the small privatelyowned businesses permitted 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs economic reforms to provide 
goods and services the staterun economy cannot 
although the cooperatives are still only a fraction of the 
official economy many soviets view them with suspicion believing 
their operators are interested only in a quick profit and that they 
take materials out of the staterun economy soviet consumers are 
being squeezed by shortages of consumer goods and food items and by 
inflation

the arab to the ground in a nearby flower shop to protect him from 
the crowd 
police said the man a 25yearold resident of the west bank 
town of ramallah acted alone israel radio said the attacker was a 
former member of a moslem fundamentalist group and police said he 
had been questioned about unspecified terrorist activities in 
the past 
the attack came one day after plo leader yasser arafat disavowed 
the 25yearold plo charter which calls for the destruction of 
israel his announcement in paris prompted protests from radical 
palestinian factions 
the stabbings further escalated arabjewish tensions in 
jerusalem already at a breaking point after 17 months of 
palestinian rebellion against israeli rule in the occupied lands 
nearly 460 palestinians and 20 israelis have been killed since the 
uprising began in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the stabbings occurred around 11 am across from jerusalems

west jerusalem 
police reinforcements including mounted horse patrols rushed 
to the scene to control groups of angry israelis who shouted 
death to the terrorists and death to the arabs

disperse dozens of followers of rabbi meir kahanes antiarab kach 
party who shouted revenge revenge the group was en route to

israelis at the bus stop four of them elderly he was going 
crazy and started stabbing people we caught him at the end of the 
street shimon told israel radio 
sima ozer an employee in the newman flower shop across from the 
post office on jaffa road said the short stocky arab was carrying 
a bloodcovered eightinch knife as he was being chased 
then a policeman came and stopped the crowd from lynching 
him she said police threw him on the floor of the flower shop

space shuttle technicians closed up 
the engine compartment today as the countdown advanced smoothly 
toward thursdays scheduled launch of atlantis with five astronauts 
nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said the launch team completed 
certification of two replacement parts in the fuel system and other 
components and reinstalled access panels on the engine compartment 
also under way today was a check of the shuttle communications 
system 
were humming right along she said 
this time were going to see if we can get it right 
astronaut david walker who will command the flight said tuesday 
four days earlier a launch attempt was called off just 31 seconds 
before the planned liftoff 
looks like the vehicles been turned around real well 
walker told reporters were extremely pleased the folks here at 
the cape were able to do such a good and quick job getting it ready 
to go again 
the other crew members are pilot ronald grabe and mission 
specialists mary cleave mark lee and norman thagard 
liftoff is scheduled for 148 pm thursday 
there are no major issues in sight robert crippen nasas 
deputy director of operations said after a mission management 
meeting tuesday were pressing on 
shuttle weather forecasters said there was a 70 percent chance 
conditions would be favorable the only concern was a threat of 
crosswinds greater than 17 mph that could be dangerous if the 
shuttle had to make an emergency landing on a runway near the 
launch pad 
atlantis will carry into space the 550 million magellan probe 
which the astronauts are to dispatch on a 15month journey to 
venus the probe is to orbit the planet and map its cloudshrouded 
surface with a high resolution radar system 
the launch attempt was halted on friday because of a short 
circuit in a fuel pump 
technicians working around the clock replaced the pump and a 
suspect fuel line in half the time expected 
engineers thought there was a leak in the fuel line but tests 
turned up nothing they believe a vapor cloud seen spewing from the 
line thought to be gas might have been trapped air 
ronald phelps a shuttle test director said the new countdown 
which started tuesday was compressed from three days to two by 
eliminating some hold time that is built into the countdown in 
case of problems and by not repeating some tasks completed in the 
first attempt

sixtythree years after his death 
legendary escape artist harry houdini pulled off another one 
he eluded efforts by magic lovers to contact him through a 
seance conducted by kreskin an entertainer who says he has special 
powers of mental telepathy 
locks jiggled and hands of seance sitters quivered tuesday but 
neither houdini nor his wife beatrice spoke to the 25 people at 
the american museum of magic hoping to hear from them 
despite about 30 minutes of handholding nobody reported 
hearing anything from either houdini 
scientifically we really have no evidence that we 
communicated with the spirit world said kreskin 
but kreskin said he will try to remedy that in the future by 
offering 1 million to anyone who can pass a test designed to 
provide evidence of psychic phenomena 
museum owner robert lund who organized the seance said he had 
hoped to get through to houdini by first reaching houdinis wife 
whom houdini had promised to contact from the grave 
houdini died oct 31 1926 in detroit after his appendix 
ruptured his wife died in 1943 
nine people including a retired judge and an assistant fire 
chief sat expectantly amid houdini mementos photos of houdini 
and his wife a will written by mrs houdini on the train back to 
new york with her husbands body and a large metal milk can from 
which houdini escaped during his act 
a large poster of houdini dating to 1911 hung above their 
heads 
they closed their eyes held hands and turned their palms up as 
kreskin slowly counted to 20 and urged them to think about mrs 
houdini 
were waiting for some sign but that sign can be within us as 
well as outside of us he said adding the signs could be shaking 
hands or feeling a breeze 
one woman said her left hand went numb another woman felt cool 
and a third said she felt hot one mans hand shook and a padlock 
on houdinis metal can jiggled 
kreskin and lund had promised no trickery but skeptics in the 
audience contended the padlock jiggled only because the wooden 
platform on which it was placed was unstable 
such physical reactions are unprovable and could be the result 
of suggestion kreskin said 
darn it there is no way on the face of the earth of 
proving spiritualistic phenomena he said 
still lund expressed no disappointment 
it was successful in terms of getting a lot of press attention 
and people here whether it was successful in contacting mrs 
houdini i dont know that we contacted mrs houdini lund said 
one thing he is sure of houdini would have liked it 
i think he would have turned to showman george m cohan and 
said say i really pulled it off george do you think you could 
do as well lund said

american education is stagnating by nearly 
every measure in a new comparison of school performance across the 
country education secretary lauro cavazos said today in releasing 
the discouraging report card 
the sixth annual state education performance chart shows a 
decline in the national high school graduation rate and falling 
scores on college entrance exams in half the states 
we must do better we must revitalize education in america 
by setting targets for improvement cavazos said in a statement 
accompanying the report 
we have not made any progress in the last three years 
cavazos elaborated in an interview on nbcs today program 
its hard to say why i still believe that we have not focused on 
the fundamental issues of trying to get everybody involved in the 
education of children its not a matter of dollars 
im going to write to every governor to every school board 
president im going to communicate with the leaders the 
superintendents and all the people out there and say we must issue 
a challenge to improve the schools cavazos said 
performance targets include boosting high school graduation 
rates to 90 percent and cutting in half the number of children who 
fail a grade 
today about 3600 students will drop out of school i think 
its a disaster that we must turn around cavazos said 
the performance chart known as the wall chart shows a 
general lack of progress despite the continuing spate of reform 
efforts and everrising education spending up to 3977 per 
student on this years chart compared to 3756 last year 
national scores on the scholastic aptitude test sat fell from 
906 to 904 on a scale of 400 to 1600 from 1987 to 1988 fully 14 
of the 22 states in which the sat is the dominant college entrance 
exam registered declines 
scores on the american college testing program act on a scale 
of 1 to 36 showed a scant 1point gain and 11 of the 28 states 
in which the act dominates posted decreases 
looking at trends since the first wall chart was issued in 1982 
one bright note was a continuous rise in the percentage of students 
taking the advanced placement test qualifying them for college 
credit from 5 to 11 percent the department attributed the climb 
largely to doubled hispanic involvement and an 83 percent increase 
in participation by blacks 
the high school graduation rate rose from 695 percent in the 
first chart to 717 percent in 1985 but it fell slightly in 1986 
to 716 percent and dropped to 711 percent in 1987 the latest 
year for which statistics could be calculated 
minnesota ranked first with a high school completion rate of 
906 percent while the district of columbia was last at 555 
percent wyoming showed the most improvement zooming from 25th in 
1982 to second in 1987 michigan did the worst falling from 28th 
to 48th 
the council of chief state school officers took a relatively 
rosy view of the wall chart saying the trend in the past few years 
has been positive the group noted that 44 of the 50 states have 
made college entrance test gains since 1982 and 38 states have 
improved their high school completion rates since then 
but gordon ambach executive director of the council added that 
the task ahead is gigantic particularly in light of the 
urgent needs of our nations economically disadvantaged youth and 
those with limited proficiency in english 
the department noted that alabama mississippi south carolina 
and the district all with relatively high poverty rates have 
registered some of the largest increases in college entrance test 
scores since 1982 it said this shows that states with large 
proportions of disadvantaged sudents can make great progress 
however while south carolina showed the most improvement of any 
state with a 48point gain in sat scores since 1982 it still 
ranked dead last this year among the 22 states in which the sat is 
the dominant test with a score of 838 the district was second 
from the bottom despite healthy gains 
alabama tied for the top in act improvement up ninetenths of a 
point since 1982 but was ranked 21st of the 28 states this year 
where most students take the act mississippi was came up 28th or 
last with an average score of 162 
mississippi also ranked last this time among all the states 
in perpupil spending the state spent 2350 per student in 1988 
alaska was the highest at 8010 followed by new york at 6497 
the wall chart also compares states on teacher salaries 
pupilteacher ratios and education reform efforts alaskan teachers 
were paid the highest in 1988 40424 while south dakotans were 
at the bottom with 19758 the national average last year was 
28008 up from 19274 in 1982 
class size ranged from a low in connecticut with a 
studentteacher ratio of just over 131 to a high in utah which 
had 247 students for each teacher the national average was 176 
on the reform front the department found that 23 states have 
minimum competency testing for graduation and a dozen have tests 
for grade promotion eight states have authority to intervene in 
academically bankrupt districts fortyfour states require or will 
soon require new teachers to take a certification exam and three 
require current teachers to take such a test

students said today they will hold a great 
protest for democratic reform now that the government has 
rejected their demand for recognition of new independent student 
unions 
the government also claimed that unidentified nonstudents who 
oppose communist rule have been advising student protesters from 
behind the scenes and it suggested that leading dissident fang 
lizhi might be one of them fang denied involvement 
the accusation seemed to herald government action against 
liberal thinkers admired by students such action against fang and 
other leading independent intellectuals followed student protests 
in 1987 
our protest tomorrow will show that chinese democracy has 
arrived at a new stage said student leader wuer kaixi of the 
beijing normal college 
thursday is the 70th anniversary of the may fourth movement the 
first prodemocracy student protests in china 
tomorrow we shall carry out a great protest with the support 
of the people wuer said may fourth is a peoples holiday 
about 60 journalists for staterun newspapers announced plans 
for their own protest thursday to express anger over censorship 
especially tight controls over what they have been allowed to say 
about the student protests 
the protests began april 15 and are the biggest in 40 years of 
communist rule but most papers are limited to printing only brief 
understated reports on the events provided by the official xinhua 
news agency 
tens of thousands of beijing students have joined in marches 
sitins pamphleteering and a class boycott to press their demands 
for democratic reforms students in a halfdozen other cities have 
held smaller marches some students in tianjin and shanghai have 
boycotted class 
the general secretary of the communist party zhao ziyang today 
addressed a handpicked audience of thousands of youths at a may 
fourth celebration in the great hall of the people he praised the 
1919 protests for their contribution to chinas advancement but he 
said stability is what the country needs now 
if stability is destroyed what can be achieved he said 
can science and democracy be achieved they cannot all that will 
result is turmoil 
police said they would close central tiananmen square on 
thursday apparently in an effort to head off another demonstration 
there 
last thursday about 150000 students and their supporters broke 
through police lines into the square chinas symbolic seat of 
power 
students from several other cities also said they planned 
marches thursday in solidarity with the beijing students demands 
for a free press an end to official corruption and other reforms 
government spokesman yuan mu today rejected demands from the 
students to recognize their new independent group the united 
association of beijing universities and meet with members protest 
leaders had said if the government rejected the demands they would 
march 
yuan told a news conference he hoped the students would not 
stage a protest but he refused to say what action would be taken 
if they did he repeated the governments assertion that the 
association and student unions set up on individual campuses are 
illegal 
behind the students are a very few people trying to create 
social disturbances yuan said they try to accomplish during 
disturbances goals that they cannot attain in circumstances of 
political stability 
he stopped short of directly accusing fang an internationally 
renowned astrophysicist of advising the protesters but he 
questioned fangs patriotism 
the role mr fang wants to play in the current disturbances 
will be decided by his words and deeds 
fang who has called for multiparty democracy denied 
involvement in the protests 
yuan knows i have never been to tiananmen square never been 
to beijing university in the last few weeks he said in a 
telephone interview

some members of congress hope to halt 
president bushs plans to coproduce a new jet fighter with japan 
saying it would shut down american industries by giving vital 
us technology to the japanese 
but key congressional leaders said the votes may not be 
available to override bushs expected veto of any congressional 
resolution disapproving the deal for production of the fsx fighter 
an advanced version of the f16 
bush administration sources said the white house is reasonably 
convinced that it has sufficient support in congress to prevent 
passage of the disapproval resolutions in the first place 
rep richard gephardt dmo has said that a twothirds 
majority probably cannot be mustered in the house to override a 
veto and senate majority leader george mitchell of maine said that 
was likely the case in the senate as well 
its a good deal for us and were going to do our best to hold 
the presidents position said senate republican leader bob dole 
of kansas after a meeting at the white house 
dole said he believes there are at least 34 votes in the senate 
to sustain a presidential veto 
meanwhile the general accounting office the chief 
congressional watchdog agency has challenged one of the bush 
administrations arguments for going ahead with the fsx deal 
the gao has concluded that much or all of the technology the 
united states is expected to receive from japan is already well 
known to the american aircraft industry a congressional source 
told the associated press last weekend 
the gao findings which are being provided to legislators in 
classified briefings this week are expected to be reported in an 
unclassified version at a hearing next tuesday of the senate 
foreign relations committee the new york times said today 
several senators and house members said they plan an allout 
attack on the coproduction agreement 
if this deal is not killed by congress we are entering into an 
agreement with a country that has made it a prime industrial policy 
to shut down american industries said sen alan dixon dill 
we have signed an agreement with a country whose government 
and industries keep domestic prices high so the japanese can sell 
their products lower in our country he said 
in the house rep mel levine dcalif said the fsx 
arrangement will hurt us competitiveness in aerospace by giving 
the japanese advanced us technology on the integration of 
aerospace systems

the productivity of american workers in the 
nonfarm sector of the economy rose 05 percent in the first three 
months of 1989 up 02 percent from the first quarter of 1988 the 
government reported today 
the labor department said output in the nonfarm sector rose 36 
percent during the first quarter while hours worked increased by 
31 percent 
significant productivity gains were reported in the 
manufacturing sector after a sluggish fourth quarter 
the department reported productivity in manufacturing rose at a 
38 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter 
with output rising a substantial 46 percent while hours of all 
persons working increased just 08 percent 
that compared to a revised productivity gain of 16 percent in 
manufacturing in the fourth quarter of 1988 and was an improvement 
over the 32 percent gain reported in the first quarter a year ago 
in the nonfarm sector as a whole the labor department reported 
that unit labor costs rose 52 percent in the first quarter up 
from 41 percent in the previous three months 
in the manufacturing sector hourly compensation increased by 
41 percent but in a sign that wage gains made by american workers 
are lagging behind inflation the department said real hourly 
compensation for the sector dropped 12 percent when the increase 
in consumer prices was taken into account 
in the overall business sector which takes farming into 
account productivity rose 35 percent in the first quarter a 
figure heavily influenced by the rebound from last years drought 
productivity had declined 10 percent in the overall business 
sector in the final quarter of 1988 
todays productivity report contained a number of revisions of 
previously reported data for 1988 
as revised the department said nonfarm business productivity 
rose 15 percent for all of 1988 with output growing by a revised 
52 percent while hours worked increased by 37 percent also 
reported was a revised increase in unit labor costs for the year of 
31 percent

the world gypsy congress said today 
it had unconfirmed reports that about 50 romanian gypsies were 
killed by romanian border guards after they tried to escape to 
hungary 
the incident purportedly took place a month ago the secretary 
of the gypsy congress rajko djuric said the claims prompted gypsy 
leaders to launch an international campaign to investigate the 
report 
we do not know exactly the date or the place but several 
different sources provided enough details for us to conclude that 
the report about this massacre is true djuric told the 
associated press 
they came to the hungarian border at night and crossed it 
illegally but since they were anthropologically easily 
recognizable for their darker complexion the hungarians turned 
them back djuric alleged 
once back on the romanian side of the border they were mowed 
down by romanian armed border guards he said 
djuric called for a commission of european parliaments to help 
investigate the allegations and said he was alerting the united 
nations and the helsinki federation for human rights

six riot police were killed and 10 
critically injured today when they were set on fire by radical 
students and president roh taewoo said he may impose emergency 
measures to end violent protests 
roh in a nationally televised speech said the government is 
determined to end a wave of protests that has hit south korea in 
recent weeks he did not specify any action but under the 
constitution he may rule by decree or impose martial law if he 
deems the nation is facing an emergency 
if violence and illegal acts endanger democracy and the future 
of the country i would be obliged to invoke emergency measures as 
empowered by the constitution roh said 
the officers were killed during a dawn raid at dongui university 
in pusan about 200 miles southeast of seoul as they tried to 
break into a room on the seventh floor of the library to free five 
officers held hostage 
militants set fire to a barricade drenched with paint thinner as 
the policemen were climbing over it police said several officers 
wrapped in flames leapt out of windows while others were burned or 
asphyxiated said police officials who declined to be identified 
national police headquarters in seoul said it was the worst loss 
of police life in recent years police said some of the 10 
policemen critically injured were expected to die one student was 
critically hurt 
all the hostages were released unharmed after professors at the 
private college pleaded with students police said they said 88 
students were arrested for questioning 
national police chief jo jongsuk resigned in south korea 
senior officials often resign to atone for a disaster even if it is 
not their fault 
also today news reports said the us cultural center in the 
provincial city of kwangju would be temporarily closed and moved to 
an as yet undetermined location the center is a frequent target of 
radical students demanding the ouster of us troops stationed in 
south korea 
officials at the us embassy denied the report by the yonhap 
news agency 
roh charged in his speech that radical students are trying to 
stage a violent revolution and declared the government is 
determined to crush them 
it has become clear that behind the flames that took the lives 
of young people there are revolutionary groups which resort to 
violence to achieve their goals he said 
opposition parties also denounced the deaths today and called 
for an end to political violence 
hundreds of radical students calling for rohs overthrow battled 
riot police around at least two seoul campuses protesters cheered 
at sungkyunkwan university when several policemen were set ablaze 
by firebombs but colleagues quickly doused the flames and the 
officers were not hurt 
protests here rarely result in deaths riot police normally are 
armed only with tear gas and batons 
prosecutors said students implicated in todays deaths would 
face charges of arson which carry a maximum penalty of death 
officials said no one had been charged 
stunned riot officers wept as the dead and injured were taken 
away about 150 police officers staged a sitdown protest at pusan 
police headquarters to complain that senior officers mishandled the 
attack yonhap reported 
police officials said about 700 riot police raided the private 
college after negotiations failed to free the hostages 
students seized the officers tuesday after demonstrating against 
the firing of warning shots by police at attackers who menaced a 
police station monday police said the students demanded police 
exchange the hostages for an arrested student 
the education ministry ordered the university closed 
indefinitely while police investigate the incident 
south korea has been hit by a wave of violent protests in recent 
weeks by radical students and dissidents demanding the overthrow of 
rohs government 
the radicals lack public support because of their extremism and 
violent tactics but they have formed alliances with striking 
workers to step up the protests 
in a related report police said today about 3800 police have 
been injured this year by firebombs rocks clubs and iron bars 
while blocking violent protesters 
police said 9950 police were injured in 1986 and 6701 in 1987

presidential assailant john w hinckley jr 
wants to leave the country with his fiancee says assassination 
expert mark lane whom hinckley has asked to represent him 
lane said hinckley 33 wants to start a new life abroad with 
formal mental patient leslie deveau who was found innocent by 
reason of insanity in the 1982 shotgun slaying of her 10yearold 
daughter 
together they would like to go to some other country and 
promise theyll never return lane said in an interview tuesday 
night he wants to go abroad and try to live a normal life 
he said hinckley who was found innocent by reason of insanity 
in the attempted assassination of president reagan did not specify 
what country he wants to live in 
lane also said in the interview that he would not exploit 
hinckley if he decides to become his attorney despite what a 
hospital attorney argued 
ive never written a book about any client of mine said 
lane author of books about the assassinations of president kennedy 
and civil rights leader dr martin luther king lane who later 
represented king assailant james earl ray met with hinckley for 
two hours tuesday 
hes asked me to represent him and i agreed that i would read 
all of the files in his case at st elizabeths and tell him if it 
would be appropriate for me said lane 
lane said hinckley feels his proposal to leave the hospital 
makes more sense than the hospitals policy of issuing weekend 
passes to select patients and requiring them to stay in the area 
hinckley received permission from us district judge june l 
green on april 20 to start negotiations to hire lane previously 
lane said the mental hospital had barred him from meeting with 
hinckley 
the attorney for st elizabeths told me the reason i was 
seeking out his case and wanted to represent him was so i could 
write a book about him and exploit him he said lane emphasized 
that hinckley made the initial contact 
in addition to his quest to leave the country hinckley has two 
primary requests lane said to be returned from maximum security 
to medium security and to be allowed to speak with the media 
in 1987 prosecutors turned up evidence hinckley was 
corresponding with serial killer ted bundy who was executed last 
year a cache of letters about actress jodie foster was uncovered 
last summer lane said 
each time st elizabeths administration was embarrassed when 
he was taken to court said lane they retaliated by placing 
him back in maximum security 
lane acknowledged that hinckley told him it was actually 
stupid of him to write to bundy in the case of the foster 
letters lane said hinckley told him a guy kept writing him 
asking if hed like pictures of foster and hinckley finally 
requested the pictures in an effort to stop the letters 
prosecutors contend that hinckley shot president reagan and 
three other men here on march 30 1981 to impress miss foster 
asked if he was leaning toward representing hinckley lane said 
i think he needs assistance and i think that his rights are 
being violated lane said he would make a decision within two

the house ethics committee today began tying 
up loose ends in its 11month probe of speaker jim wright by 
hearing from the first of a group of texas investors in a gas well 
that yielded huge profits for wright 
san antonio financier morris jaffe was the first to go before 
the panel entering the hearing room in the capitol basement with 
his washington lawyer stanley brand jaffe and four others stood 
up the committee a week ago when two members traveled to san 
antonio to interview them 
i hope they will cooperate for the sake of getting this task 
completed said rep john t myers rind the panels senior 
republican myers said the work of inquiring into the gas well 
venture was tying up committee staff who otherwise could be 
preparing for a disciplinary hearing for wright expected to come 
late this month 
the committee is seeking to clear up circumstances under which 
wright and his business partner george mallick were brought into 
the well venture in sabine lake near the texaslouisiana line and 
parlayed an initial cash outlay of 9120 into a 340000 profit in 
less than five months 
in a 23page defense the investors issued monday by brand they 
argued that the well was a legitimate business venture and not as 
ethics committee counsel richard phelan argued a potential funnel 
for gifts to wright 
the investors say they still plan to invest more into sinking 
another well at the site in hopes of freeing millions of dollars 
worth of gas and petroleum 
also subpoenaed were jaffes son doug president of the familys 
companies marlyn cherry the jaffes bookkeeper doug prestridge 
a geologist and dave myers who supplied the drilling equipment 
for the well 
in a related matter wright on tuesday defended his use of the 
congressional record to praise a video program his wife helped 
develop but a member of the house ethics committee said the panel 
might have to look at the incident 
i dont think theres anything improper about it wright 
told reporters i think its a tempest in a teapot 
but myers said the situation certainly does raise a question 
and could be discussed by the ethics committee its something 
for the whole committee to decide he said 
in 1985 wright used his position as a congressman to insert 
into the official capitol publication a column effusively praising 
a family motivational video series produced by the pacific 
institute the column did not mention that his wife betty was 
then drawing a 36000 salary from the company 
house rules prohibit a lawmaker from benefiting financially 
because of his official position and guidelines advise that house 
members not become too closely associated with any particular 
business or make commercial endorsements 
also on tuesday wright criticized the ethics committees 
process saying he has been denied a chance to address the issues 
that formed the basis for the 69 counts of house rules violations 
he now faces 
i thought id answered everything they had in mind wright 
said referring to his testimony to the committee last september 
but the ultimate charges were based on information that was 
developed since then he said 
at the same time wright and his advisers continued to map a 
plan for making the speakers case both to the ethics committee at 
an anticipated disciplinary hearing late this month and to the 
public 
sources said wright complained vigorously at a strategy session 
monday that he was being unfairly pilloried by the press and by the 
ethics committee and voiced frustration that the story of his 
public service career from world war ii on was being obscured 
advisers also discussed how to handle the announcement of an 
emerging defense team led by his current lawyer william oldaker 
and bolstered by the presence of democratic patriarch clark 
clifford and perhaps other attorneys with strong courtroom defense 
experience

president pw botha today said a 
general election will be held sept 6 he is expected to retire 
shortly afterward 
the election will be the first in which white mixedrace and 
asian voters cast ballots on the same day for parliaments three 
segregated chambers 
south africas black majority has no vote in national affairs 
and no representation in parliament 
september marks the end of the fiveyear term for the asian and 
mixedrace chambers which were estabished in 1984 following widely 
boycotted elections for voters of those racial groups 
the most recent white general election was in 1987 
bothas national party is heavily favored to retain its 
overwhelming majority in the dominant white chamber where it now 
holds 130 of the 178 seats 
botha 73 last month announced his intention to retire after 
the elections although he did not set a date for the balloting at 
that time he has headed the government since 1978 
the new president is expected to be the national education 
minister fw de klerk 53 who succeeded botha as national party 
leader on feb 2 many nationalists view de klerk as more flexible 
than botha and more capable of breaking the countrys blackwhite 
political stalemate 
while the national party will seek to retain its majority the 
extremeright conservative party and the antiapartheid democratic 
party will be vying to the largest opposition faction 
the conservatives currently have a twoseat edge over the 
democartic party formed last month through a merger of three 
separate liberal parties

a nicaraguan immigrant who won a 53 million 
lottery jackpot got more good news today as immigration officials 
reversed themselves and granted his application for political 
asylum 
justo ricardo somarriba along with his wife and three children 
had faced the prospect of having to take the money back to 
nicaragua if the us immigration and naturalization service backed 
a state department finding that his political asylum claim was 
frivolous 
but today ins district director perry rivkind said he personally 
had reviewed the case and granted the asylum 
this has nothing to do with the jackpot rivkind said he 
was a teacher in the government education department and he 
resisted propagandizing on behalf of the sandinista marxist 
government 
that could subject him to political persecution if he returned 
to his homeland rivkind said 
even if he hadnt been granted asylum state lottery officials 
said he still would have gotten his half of last weeks 106 
million lotto jackpot 
anybody who wins keeps the money said ed george a lottery 
spokesman in tallahassee in california an illegal mexican 
immigrant was deported with his money after winning the lottery 
in that state 
somarriba received the first of 20 annual checks for about 
264000 at a ceremony monday in tallahassee 
somarriba 30 from masaya nicaragua a rural town about 90 
miles south of managua entered the country by crossing the rio 
grande near brownsville texas on march 22 1987 said richard 
smith rivkinds deputy 
he filed his application for asylum on may 6 1987 
we notified the state department that his application was 
considered frivolous on december 14 1987 they approved and sent 
it back to us on january 19 1988 since then it has been hung up 
in paperwork smith said 
employees in the asylum unit are about 40000 applications 
behind he said 
applications deemed frivolous are rarely approved on appeal 
smith added 
somarriba lives in miami with his wife maria elena and three 
children ages 9 7 and 3

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
april 27 
tucson ariz citizen on abortion 
the activists are so positive about abortion they hide behind 
their chosen pro words protected against doubts prochoice 
prolife 
caught between two extremes that have split the nation in a 
moral civil war are the majority of thinking americans fed up with 
simplistic shock rhetoric and selfserving doublespeak their 
proword is protest 
proabortion groups warn of backalley deaths by abortion 
butchers if abortion is outlawed they beg sympathy for the poor 
unwed mother or rape victim for whom an abortion is the difference 
between life and death of hope and opportunity 
at the other extreme are the antiabortion marchers who shock 
with pictures of welladvanced fetuses they describe women who 
have abortions as murderers and compare 16 million abortions each 
year to historys most appalling genocide 
both sides tell sophisticated lies 
if the supreme court allowed the states to decide there 
would be no need for back alley deaths 
the missouri law being reviewed by the supreme court doesnt 
outlaw abortion it restricts state support most abortions are 
done in private clinics 
and most women who obtain abortions are not rape victims nor 
are they poor the implication that some see abortion as a 
convenient birth control of last resort is morally repugnant and 
belies the stereotype favored by proabortion propaganda 
but equally unjust is the abortion on demand cliche that 
justifies state interference to halt alleged casual 
carelessness with human life and let government make our moral 
decisions

los angeles times on president bushs environmental appointees 
president bush has made one outstanding appointment in william 
k reilly as chief of the environmental protection agency 
but his selections for other critical natureresource jobs raise 
serious questions about the administrations pledge to safeguard 
the nations parks wilderness and coastline 
james cason has been nominated as assistant secretary of 
agriculture in charge of the us forest service and cy jamison has 
been selected to be director of the bureau of land management 
cason is a former oregon real estate developer who constantly 
ran afoul of the nations environmental organizations as deputy 
assistant secretary of the interior jamison for the past eight 
years he has been an aide to rep ron marlenee rmont 
bushs determination to build a strong environmental record will 
be severly undermined or doomed unless he also has managers at 
interior and the forest service who are willing to put conservation 
and protection of the nations dwindling natural estate ahead of 
the businessasusual practice of commercial exploitation 
the new appointees should be given a chance to demonstrate such 
a commitment but so far the record is not encouraging

first 100 days 
assessments of the first 100 days of the bushquayle 
administration which have poured from washington like a river 
have been nothing if not predictable 
read what president bush or vice president quayle has to say 
about the first 100 days just fine gaining momentum under 
control 
read what conservatives say competent if not spectacular 
read what liberals say lack of focus unimpressive 
funny thats exactly what they were saying last year before the 
election 
the fact is 100 days is too soon for anyone the president 
included to make any meaningful assessment of a new 
administration in that short amount of time the president can do 
little more than react to situations while he tries to put his team 
together 
members of that new team in the meantime are still trying to 
remember the way to the nearest restroom 
the measure of a presidency is how successful it is at 
accomplishing the goals it sets for itself and how appropriate 
those goals turn out to be the voters will be making the final 
assessment on that when they go to the polls in 1992

the news and courier charleston sc on dismantling the 
pentagon 
little by little piece by piece the reagan revolution insofar 
as it affected the nations armed forces is being dismantled 
money more precisely a shortage of money is at the bottom of it 
with not enough money in a trilliondollarplus budget to go 
around not enough to sate the insatiable demands of politically 
attractive social programs not enough to begin to reduce the 
crushing burden of accumulated debt the army the navy and the air 
force become attractive targets for those with eyes focused less on 
the stars than on the next election 
now there is nothing inherently wrong in reasoned reductions in 
the nations armed strength to match reductions in perceived threat 
indeed were congress and the administration to support 
enormously expensive armed forces in excess of those actually 
required to deter war they would be no less guilty of malfeasance 
than if the forces they funded were by design inadequate to the 
task 
we hope that president bush and secretary dick cheney both 
new in the job have not gotten the horse before the cart the last 
thing we need is a return to the dreadful 1960s and 70s when our 
armed forces were stretched to the breaking point and some would 
say beyond

tampa fla tribune on the uss iowa 
many americans hearts fill with awe and pride at the sight of a

of horse cavalry but they cant 
while the navy still has battleships such as the iowa in whose 
no 2 gun turret an explosion april 19 killed 47 crew members the 
armys horse cavalry is long gone replaced by tanks 
the explosion in its no 2 turret is not a major reason for 
mothballing the iowa and its three sisters again and for the last 
time 
the best reason has existed for decades and its a shame that 
it took the deaths of 47 brave men to remind us that the 
battleship like the horse cavalry has long since had its day

the journal new ulm minn on the uss iowa 
the navy has acted properly in convening a board of inquiry into 
the explosion aboard the uss iowa that claimed the lives of 47 
seamen 
while we may never learn the cause of the disaster the navy has 
acted wisely we believe in imposing a moratorium on the firing of 
all its 16inch guns 
it is now up to the defense department to go one step more and 
conduct a thorough review of the need to retain these old ships 
like the iowa in service 
what we have here is world war i technology aboard a world war 
ii ship attempting to defend a nation headed into the 21st century 
the uss iowa and its sister ships are nearing the halfcentury 
mark the technology of those 16inch guns requires sailors to hand 
carry 110pound silk bags of gunpowder to load the guns 
we do not question the unmatched capacity for sustained 
firepower that these ships can deliver but the question should be 
asked if maybe they were better suited for helping contain 
brushfire wars in various parts of the globe and be replaced for 
general combat 
for the billions of dollars we spend on defense we think its 
time we think about retiring aging battleships that present a risk 
of life for our own servicemen

registration 
the new jersey rainbow coalition is calling for sameday voter 
registation in the state in other states this system has spurred 
greater voter participation and no increase in election fraud 
the rainbow coalition makes some other good points for example 
why cant citizens register to vote at government agencies as they 
pay for water bills or renew a drivers license 
why must voters register before a 29day cutoff why are 
registered voters purged from the voting rolls if they havent cast 
a ballot over a fouryear period 
the united states ranks among the lowest in voter turnout among 
the western democracies but our powersthatbe arent too worried 
about that why should they be if the demographics of the voting 
public ever changed perhaps theyd become powersthatwere 
we should all be concerned that such a large chunk of society 
made up largely of the underprivileged and undereducated doesnt 
vote because of the red tape and bureaucratic hassles

radioactive releases from a government uranium 
processing plant in ohio likely have been two to six times greater 
than estimated and internal documents reveal a history of 
deceptive recordkeeping and inadequate pollution monitoring a 
consultant reported today 
the findings involve a 1050acre energy department plant at 
fernald ohio 18 miles northwest of cincinnati where federal 
officials have acknowledged that significant amounts of uranium 
particles over the years have been released into the air 
the government has estimated that as much as 552000 pounds of 
radioactive uranium dust may have escaped into the air from the 
plant which has been producing uranium for nuclear weapons use for 
nearly four decades 
but the report by an engineering consulting firm indicates the 
releases could be as great as 31 million pounds over 37 years and 
in any case was higher than the governments worstcase scenario 
the report was prepared for lawyers pressing the 300 million 
lawsuit against national lead of ohio inc which operated the 
plant until 1985 on behalf of 14000 people who live nearby 
the suit which alleges the plant has created a health hazard 
and reduced property values is scheduled to go to trial next 
month chris sankey a spokeswoman for the energy department said 
the department would have no comment on the consultants report 
because of the litigation 
the institute for energy and environmental research said it 
based its higher release estimates on information provided by a 
former plant supervisor in a court deposition and a computer 
analysis of levels of radioactive contaminants found in soil 
samples within five miles of the plant 
the official estimates cited so far by the government of 
cumulative releases of uranium to the air from this plant are based 
in part on fabricated data and what plant documents themselves 
describe as an inherently deceptive method of calculating some 
of the releases said arjun makhijani the author of the study 
among the findings cited by the report 
comments in a court deposition by michael w boback former 
head of industrial hygiene and radiation at the plant during about 
a dozen years stack filters at some buildings were not examined 
but zero loss entries were nevertheless made in release 
records 
no adequate accounting was made of radioactive releases from 
areas not specifically monitored although internal documents show 
such releases likely were significant a spot check on such 
releases during one month shows releaes greater than tabulated for 
the plants entire 37year history in the government estimates 
documents indicating that losses of uranium particles from 
stack scrubbers were understated because the estimates were based 
on highly efficient scrubbers while internal plant memos show 
scrubbers often malfunctioning or in poor condition 
the engineering consultants also used a computer analysis of 
soil samples within five miles of the plant showing average levels 
of about eight times what would be expected if releases had been 
limited to the estimates cited by the energy department

the judge in oliver norths trial said today 
he imposed a longer daily work schedule on the jury and said he 
isnt surprised the panel is in its 11th day of deliberations 
without reaching a verdict 
us district judge gerhard gesell said in a court session that 
he initiated the move to have the jury start promptly at 9 in the 
morning take a half hour for lunch and stay until 5 in the 
afternoon that schedule began tuesday 
gesell said that due to health problems among some jurors early 
in the deliberations the panel had been working more limited hours 
and they had gotten used to a shorter schedule one panel 
member was experiencing high blood pressure and a few others had 
colds but all are now in good health 
the judge made the remarks in response to letters from 
prosecutors and norths lawyers inquiring about various aspects of 
deliberations 
i felt there was time being wasted in the sense that when they 
came in in the morning they were not starting as early as they 
could have when they arrived said gesell as for leaving at 415 
in the afternoon i felt i should indicate they should stay 
gesell said he doesnt think it is surprising that the 
deliberations are growing lengthy in view of the fact that there 
have been 67 witnesses 41 trial days and we are dealing with 
over 250 exhibits 
we are running out of books to while away the hours 
prosecutor john keker quipped referring to the length of 
deliberations 
gesell responded by saying he understood there is a movie you 
could look at referring to the tv miniseries on norths life 
guts and glory which concluded tuesday night 
the panel of nine women and three men deliberated 7 hours 
tuesday bringing the total spent at the end of the day since april 
21 to 53 
the jurors have put in sixhour workdays on three occasions 
since that time but hadnt gone longer than that until tuesday 
there has been no word from the jury since april 24 when the 
last of eight notes was sent to gesell the notes ranged from 
requests for paper clips to a plea for a nurse to monitor the high

doctors should spend more time counseling 
their patients on how to lead healthier lives through diet 
exercise and other preventive means a panel of healthcare experts 
says 
the report tuesday by us preventive services task force also 
questions the value of routine screening tests and says physicians 
should reserve use of these procedures for highrisk patients 
the key to improved health and disease prevention often lies 
in lifestyle changes made by patients rather than in the broad 
testing or sophisticated medical procedures performed by health 
providers dr robert s lawrence task force chairman and 
director of primary care at harvard medical school said upon 
release the panels guide to clinical preventive services 
about 5000 copies of the nearly 300page guide are to be 
distributed to medical educators and societies of healthcare 
professionals it is expected to be available in medical bookstores 
by summer 
the guide recommends that physicians counsel their patients who 
smoke on how to kick the habit their sexually active patients on 
how to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and all their patients 
to engage in regular physical activity 
doctors should also provide periodic counseling on diet and all 
patients should be urged to use seat belts and should be warned 
about the effects of drugs and alcohol the guide says 
the guide also concludes that routine chest xrays are 
ineffective as a screening tool for lung cancer and that electronic 
fetal monitoring currently used in more than half of all 
deliveries should be used only for highrisk pregnancies 
the panel said it is unclear whether fecal occult blood testing 
is an effective routine screening tool for colorectal cancer or 
whether digital rectal examinations are an effective test for 
prostate cancer in men who have no symptoms of the disease 
our review of the data has shown that routinely performing a 
uniform battery of tests on patients is often ineffective in 
improving health and can potentially lead to large numbers of 
inaccurate results lawrence said 
lawrence said that a greater emphasis on providing information 
and patient counseling will require changes in the attitudes of 
doctors and in the medical fee system its going to be a long 
hard struggle he said 
the report made no financial recommendations but lawrence said 
insurance companies should change how they reimburse for physician 
services raising what they pay for information and counseling 
services in relation to surgical services which are generally 
reimbursed at a higher rate 
about 5 percent of federal health care dollars currently are 
spent on preventive services a health and human services 
department official said 
dr j michael mcginnis deputy assistant secretary for health 
at hhs accepted the task forces report but offered little comment 
on its conclusions saying that health secretary louis sullivan 
will need a little time to consider the vast array of 
recommendations 
the task force a 20member panel of healthcare experts was 
appointed by the department of health and human services in 1984 
it reviewed more than 2400 scientific studies to assess the 
effectiveness of more than 100 clinical screening procedures for 
the prevention of 60 diseases and conditions

the senate went on record today against 
boosting gasoline taxes as it pushed ahead with work on a budget 
that complies with congress deficitreduction agreement with the 
white house 
the antigastax amendment approved by voice vote expressed 
the sense of the senate that motor fuel taxes should remain 
dedicated to improvements in the highway and transportation system 
there is no specific call for such a tax in the trilliondollar 
spending plan now before congress however sources have said the 
administration is considering proposing to combine a gastax 
increase with a reduction in the capital gains tax on investments 
in the budget to be submitted next year 
while senate leaders accepted the nonbinding gastax amendment 
without a quarrel majority leader george mitchell said other 
amendments might be used to undermine the white house agreement in 
those cases the maine democrat said a majority will prevail 
and the plan will survive 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee continued his criticism of the budget plan today 
although he now acknowledges hell probably vote for it the plan 
contains those kind of assumptions that result in a budget that i 
dont think has much realism to it he said on cbs this 
morning 
debate on the 117 trillion spending plan for fiscal 1990 began 
tuesday night in the senate and was starting today in the house 
the plan arrives here bloody but i believe unbowed largely 
because it represents the very best compromise reachable said 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget committee 
that helped draft the blueprint 
the agreement reached last month with the white house designed 
to reduce the deficit by about 28 billion to below the 100 
billion limit of the grammrudman law 
critics of the agreement and the budgets it has produced 
contend that the deficit reduction it claims is mostly illusory 
since billions of dollars in alleged savings are really just 
accounting changes for example nearly 1 billion in payments to 
farmers would be made early so they occur before the start of the 
fiscal year 
in addition the resulting deficit projection is based on white 
house economic forecasts that have been widely criticized as too 
optimistic 
but sasser and others defending the plan said congress should 
focus on the positive 
its a first manageable step toward the ultimate deficit 
reduction objective we all share said sasser saying he hoped 
for a strong vote for passage here on the senate floor 
president bush at the white house on tuesday told congressional 
leaders he hoped the budgets would be approved and lawmakers should 
reject killer amendments several including one to send the 
whole deal back for further negotiations were expected to be 
offered 
house minority leader bob michel rill said after the white 
house meeting that the budget was close to what the 
administration had asked for he and the democratic leaders were 
working to make sure no amendments in their chamber would upset 
the whole apple cart 
sen pete v domenici rnm senior republican on the budget 
panel said those critical of the progress made in reducing the 
deficit just dont know the facts he cited projections of a 
few years ago that the deficit in the current fiscal year would be 
300 billion nearly twice what is now expected 
what would a big deficit deal be for next year he asked 
taxes he said something bush has promised to veto and the 
democrats dont want to embrace without presidential leadership 
actually taxes are part of the current agreement both the 
house and senate budgets include the 53 billion in unspecified 
new tax revenues that are in the white house agreement 
the president contends most of that would be new revenue 
generated by reducing the tax rate on capital gains but democrats 
say they wont go along with that plan and suggest that alternative 
levies acceptable to president must be found 
the plans also include other new revenues including 57 
billion from selling off government assets and about 27 billion 
in higher fees for government services 
as called for in the white house pact between the president and 
congressional leaders both the house and senate budgets envision 
2992 billion in military spending next year about the same as 
the current year 
the pentagon would be given total spending authority of 3055 
billion a figure which includes some outlays which stretch past 
the end of the fiscal year 
foreign aid spending would be set at 17 billion 
entitlement programs would grow so individual benefits and 
costofliving increases would escape cuts however a variety of 
costcutting actions including some of those bookkeeping changes 
would allow for 83 billion in total savings from medicare 
agriculture federal pensions and other entitlements 
in other domestic programs the white house agreement set an 
overall spending cap but gave no specifics and the house and 
senate budget committees took somewhat different approaches the 
house favored education health and veterans programs compared with 
more senate emphasis on agriculture energy and law enforcement 
once the house and senate complete their budgets the two 
chambers must agree on a single resolution the document then 
serves as the guide for the annual spending and tax legislation 
produced by the congress

the third incident of food tampering in 
less than a week has surfaced in central illinois as pinlike 
objects were found in vending machine candy authorities said today 
a shoestore employee at hickory point mall in forsyth just 
north of decatur bit into a piece of candy and cut his mouth on a 
sharp object tuesday said sgt jerry dawson of the macon county 
sheriffs police 
kevin gentry 26 spit the candy into a sink dawson said after 
waiting on customers he looked back into the sink and found metal 
that could have been a brokenoff straight pin or needle 
dawson said 
a coworker later found another pinlike object in a piece of the 
candycoated peanuts dawson said 
seven machines in the mall that serve up handfuls of the candy 
were locked up pending investigation dawson said 
meanwhile investigators say they believe that pins reportedly 
found in heinz baby food jars in jacksonville and springfield are 
isolated incidents 
the companys baby food was removed from store shelves in 
jacksonville tuesday after a complaint monday night springfield 
grocers returned heinz baby products to their shelves tuesday after 
an incident of food tampering was reported there last week 
nobody was hurt in either baby food case 
police in springfield about 35 miles east of jacksonville said 
monday that authorities had no objections to restocking because 
there was no evidence the tampering occurred at the point of 
production 
spokeswoman beth adams of heinz usa in pittsburgh a division 
of hj heinz co said the criminal investigation in springfield 
is continuing as tampering is a federal crime 
there is a 99toone chance that the jacksonville complaint 
will be found to be isolated and a copycat of tampering cases 
in great britain she said 
ms adams said heinz usa has no connection to the heinz 
company affected by tampering in britain where some 300 cases of 
contamination were reported including food found with glass 
shards razor blades and caustic soda

vice president dan quayle visiting his 
third southeast asian country in as many days discussed economic 
issues and the future of cambodia in getacquainted meetings with 
thai officials today 
quayle was greeted with a 19gun salute when he arrived here for 
a 1day stay that will include a tour thursday of a border camp 
for nearly 60000 cambodian refugees about 200 miles from bangkok 
the fate of cambodia has been a dominant theme during the vice 
presidents 12day tour of australia indonesia singapore and 
thailand in jakarta indonesia he met with prince norodom 
sihanouk the cambodian resistence leader whom the united states 
wants to head a transition goverment after vietnam withdraws its 
occupation troops this fall 
quayle said at a news conference today that the united states 
will not consider closer diplomatic ties with vietnam until that 
country removes itself from cambodia 
part of quayles responsibility on his trip is to gather ideas 
from other asian nations on cambodia and report back to president 
bush whose administration is reassessing its policy towards phnom 
penh among the options are providing military aid to the 
noncommunist factions seeking to take over in cambodia 
quayle explained the basic us position on cambodia during a 
50minute meeting with thai prime minister chatichai choonhavan and 
also stressed the importance the united states places on protection 
of copyrights perhaps the only major friction in otherwise strong 
relations between the two countries 
earlier this year the united states thailands major export 
market denied the country 165 million in dutyfree exports the 
action was taken after washington complained the thais had failed 
to honor intellectual property rights for instance copying 
patented drugs 
the united states is weighing whether to further blunt thai 
exports by imposing additional trade restrictions 
thai government spokesman suvit yoadmanee quoted chatichai as 
telling quayle the united states should not take drastic action on 
the issue because overall relations including antinarcotics 
cooperation were good he noted that most recent negotiations had 
gone well 
chatichai according to suvit said the united states should 
regard thailand as a springboard for trade with indochina and 
burma and noted there was room for increases in trade and joint 
ventures between thailand and the united states 
quayle also conferred with foreign minister siddhi savetsila and 
had an audience with king bhumibol adulyadej the vice president 
and his wife marilyn were to be guests at a banquet tonight 
while quayle met with the prime minister a halfdozen 
university students attempted to hand to the vice president an open 
letter protesting any implementation of further restrictions 
claiming it would amount to overt intervention of thailands 
internal affairs 
thai security kept the students from entering government house 
where quayle and chatichai were meeting and the students 
circulated the letter among reporters and others 
deputy prime minister pong sarasin said he was more relaxed 
than 30 days ago after having received reports about the latest 
status of negotiations on traderelated issues 
quayle arrived here from singapore he leaves thursday for 
alaska where he will monitor cleanup efforts from the march 24 
exxon valdez oil spill in prince william sound 
in singapore quayle met with prime minister lee kuan yew during 
a visit designed to strengthen ties between the united states and 
the island republic 
quayle said tuesdays meeting with lee was fruitful and the two 
discussed every single issue i can imagine 
he said he was impressed by singapores economic miracle 
and booming economy 
quayle also saw goh chok tong singapores defense minister and 
deputy prime minister 
at that session quayle raised the subject of the singapore 
governments restrictions on the circulation of the usowned 
asian wall street journal and far eastern economic review 
according to gohs private secretary tan jee say 
i did bring this up quayle said afterward we have a 
difference of opinion on this we still hope that they will 
change but he added it was up to the singapore government 
goh reiterated his governments position that foreign newspapers 
are circulated in singapore not as a right but as a privilege 
granted by the government on terms set by the government 
according to tan 
the government allows papers to circulate in singapore so long 
as they do not engage in domestic politics goh said 
in 1987 the singapore government severely restricted the 
circulation of both publications a move that prompted the far 
eastern economic review to shut down all distribution here 
editors from both papers have denied allegations by the 
singapore government that they meddled in local government 
restrictions on the press as well as human rights concerns have 
strained ussingapore relations at times over the past years 
last year singapore expelled an american diplomat claiming that 
he was interfering in domestic politics in his contacts with the 
opposition 
washington denied that charge it also has criticized singapore 
in the past for detaining political opponents 
while in singapore the vice president also played golf his 
second stint on the greens of his asiapacific trip the round was 
cut short after five holes because of rain

novelist walker percy said wednesday that 
modern science is radically incoherent because it has failed to 
bridge the gap between mind and matter by recognizing the 
importance of human language 
delivering the 18th annual jefferson lecture of the national 
endowment for the humanities percy urged creating a new science 
of man that focuses on the words and meanings of language the 
only place he said where mind and matter intersect 
we do not find it odd that there is only one science of 
chemistry and neurology but at last count more than 600 different 
schools of psychotherapy and growing percy said in text of his 
speech 
we accept the explanation that after all the mind is vastly 
more complicated than a molecule of sodium chloride or even a nerve 
cell he said 
that may be true but it doesnt explain why the physical 
sciences are converging whereas the psychic sciences are 
diverging that is getting nuttier he said 
percy an awardwinning novelist from new orleans and a former 
physician delivered his lecture titled the fateful rift the 
san andreas fault in the modern mind before 1000 invited guests 
the jefferson lecture given by an eminent scholar every year 
since 1972 is the highest federal honor for outstanding 
achievement in the humanities it carries a stipend of 10000 
percy said science ignores or fails to deal with the relation 
between the human mind and the physical world contemporary 
psychology he says deals with visible measurable entities such 
as neurons and synapses and mental phenomena such as self or 
ego without linking them 
however he said an increasing number of people are beginning 
to know that a different sort of reality lies at the heart of all 
uniquely human activity speaking listening understanding 
thinking looking at art 
percy said this reality mans unique behavior of language and 
symbolmongering eventually must be confronted by science as a 
natural phenomenon that explains humanity 
art poetry and novels ought to be taken very seriously 
indeed since these are the cognitive scientific statements 
that we have about what it is to be human percy said 
the humanities in a word are not the minstrels of the age 
whose only role is to promise r amp r to tired technicians and 
consumers after work he said 
rather are the humanities the elder brother of the sciences 
who sees how the new scientist got his tail in a crack when he 
takes on the human subject as object and who even shows him the 
shape of a new science

thursday is tax freedom day once you put 
in your eight hours youll be working for yourself the rest of the 
year 
the tax foundation calculates the average american will have to 
work 124 days this year the same as in 1987 and 1988 just to 
pay federal state and local taxes thursday is the 124th day of 
the year 
tax freedom day has never fallen later in the year this years 
date is also the same as in 1981 before president reagan and 
congress agreed on a 23percent acrosstheboard cut in individual 
income tax rates 
economists for the foundation a nonpartisan washington research 
group say the value of that tax cut has been offset by more than a 
dozen subsequent federal tax increases and by higher state and 
local taxes caused partially by cuts in federal programs 
the foundations calculations are based on the assumption that 
all taxes including those collected by businesses ultimately are 
paid by individuals

448 to 761 a month captains salaries will go from 248 to 421 
and sergeants will earn 209 up from 123 
rodriguez who toppled dictator alfredo stroessner in a coup 
feb 3 also announced 30 percent pay raises for public employees 
and 49 percent increases for workers in clinics and hospitals 
on tuesday rodriguez announced the retirement of up to three 
dozen army generals some of them stroessner loyalists as part of 
a shakeup to allow younger officers to move up in rank 
within a few days or within the month of may ill give you 
the list of those who have left retired and those who have been 
promoted to general rodriguez told reporters as he left the 
national palace 
the central electoral board said today that of 898829 votes 
counted so far rodriguez received 667434 or slightly more than 
74 percent 
his governing colorado party won control of congress in the vote 
i am pleased and happy that i have the affection of the 
people and they showed their confidence in me rodriguez said 
when asked about the results 
some losers fumed about voting irregularities but paraguayans 
seemed satisfied with the triumph of rodriguez a longtime 
stroessner aide who has respected civil liberties and promised 
democratic reforms since taking power 
you couldnt expect any other result because the people are 
very grateful to him for putting his life in danger to bring us 
freedom said susana jara 50 a fruit vendor in the public 
market 
half of the vote for rodriguez was a thank you for 
overthrowing stroessner said aldo zuccolillo editor of the 
newspaper abc color that reopened last march after being shut down 
five years ago by the former regime 
fernando vera presidential candidate of the revolutionary 
febrerista party noted the elections many irregularities but 
said rodriguez obviously won by a landslide 
rodriguez has pledged to support reforms of the constitution 
electoral law and the penal code he also promised not to seek 
reelection in 1993 
the balloting was to choose a successor to finish the fiveyear 
terms of stroessner who now lives in brazil and the congress that 
rodriguez dissolved after the coup 
the partial official tally gave the governing colorado party 
672 percent of the vote for the 36member senate and the 72member 
chamber of deputies unofficial tallies gave the colorados in 
power since 1947 similar winning margins

irregularities in the voting on tuesday he met with other party 
leaders to decide whether to issue a protest 
flaws cited by international election observers and party 
officials included lack of space for voting in private lack of 
indelible ink to prevent multiple voting and apparently illegal 
lastminute registrations by the colorados 
the conduct of the elections was far from perfect the 
washingtonbased national democratic institute for international 
affairs said in a statement 
the group an arm of the democratic party noted the short time 
to prepare and the countrys history of authoritarian rule 
widespread vote fraud occurred during the eight elections won by 
stroessner in his nearly 35 years of rule

these are troubled times for american apple 
producers says the agriculture department 
recent concern about apples treated with alar and other 
chemicals is part of the problem for growers but so is the 
expansion in apple production both domestically and worldwide 
adding to the pressure consumers could have cut demand for 
apples as health concerns arose of the use of the pesticide alar 
says economist amy sparks it remains to be seen if alar use will 
permanently curtail consumer demand 
domestic demand for apples is relatively flat right now 
while competition in the international market is intensifying 
sparks writes in the may issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
if demand does not increase many us producers may be forced 
to leave the business she said 
the usda food and drug administration and other government 
agencies have declared the us apple supply safe to eat but the 
recent alar scare raised questions about the safety of apples 
treated with the chemical prompting a number of schools across the 
country to temporarily ban apples from lunchrooms 
sparks who works for the departments economic research 
service said new plantings in the late 1970s and early 1980s are 
pushing up us apple production a new planting comes into 
production in 5 or 6 years and reaches nearly full capacity after 8 
or 9 years 
when the new plantings begin bearing at full capacity output 
will be comparable to 1987 the largest crop in us history she 
said 
total production in 1987 the marketing year runs from july 
through the following june was a record 48 million metric tons 
up from 36 million tons in each of the two previous years the 
preliminary estimate for 1988 is 4 million tons 
sparks said the decline for 1988 is due to the drought in some 
areas and because apples like most tree crops are cyclical 
after a year of high yields production is smaller the following 
year also although new trees are coming into production other 
orchards are growing older and are yielding less 
one factor has been a deterioration in the us apple trade 
balance she said imports reached 121000 tons in 198788 more 
than double the volume of the mid1970s part of the reason was the 
sharp drop in the value of chiles peso against the dollar which 
lowered the price of chilean apples 
meanwhile us fresh apple exports rose to 305000 tons in 
198081 from 120063 tons in 197677 however exports declined 
after 198081 when the dollar began rising against vitually all 
us apple importers 
exports for the 198788 marketing year at 293000 tons were 
70 percent higher than the previous year sparks said this was 
partly due to the low prices induced by the record crop and partly 
due to the us dollars decline during 198587 
sparks said that a number of countries including chile new 
zealand and south africa have been boosting apple production and 
exports these southern hemisphere producers are able to export 
fresh apples while the united states is drawing on its cold storage 
supplies 
the major export markets for us apples are canada the 
european economic community and the far east she said in each the 
united states faces comptition from the three southern hemisphere 
countries 
but some important markets are opening up for american producers 
in the far east including taiwan hong kong singapore thailand 
the philippines and japan 
sweden has agreed to open its market earlier for us apples 
previously imports were allowed only when local supplies were 
exhausted usually by middecember sparks said in 198990 the 
opening date will be nov 15 and in future years will be open year 
round

louise walsh tried to teach the 
belfast city council about art and instead learned about the 
pitfalls of trying to work with all parties in northern ireland 
the 26yearold artists first commission a bronze sculpture 
commemorating the redlight past of downtown belfast proved too 
much for the citys protestant elders and it expired in a 
political wrangle that fractured normal protestantcatholic lines 
councillor rhonda paisley daughter of protestant firebrand rev 
ian paisley liked it so did lily fitzsimmons of sinn fein the 
party that supports the overwhelmingly roman catholic irish 
republican army 
but other councillors protested that prostitutes were being 
glorified and sainted mothers insulted or that the statue had been 
hijacked by ira supporters 
i thought id done so well said miss walsh who dispirited 
by the whole experience found solace at the crown a grand old 
gaslit pub near the place where her sculpture was to stand 
miss walsh a native of county cork in the irish republic 
envisioned a bronze sculpture of two women one 7 feet tall and the 
other a bit shorter both chastely dressed 
the workingwomen theme would be expressed by making one figure 
out of balls of wool knitting a scrub brush and clothespins and 
the other out of sewing machines telephones cash registers and 
typewriters 
she got her first inkling of trouble when councillor frank 
millar reviewed a model 
i was told he said that the figure showed the womens 
breasts but i couldnt say it was made out of old bits of tin and 
my eyesights not so good 
millars opinion counted because he chaired the parks committee 
which would review the proposal sensing danger miss walsh decided 
to take her case to every party on the committee 
i was innocently i mean quite genuinely trying to explain 
to people it was not a glorification of prostitution miss walsh 
said 
she said she told the committee the sculpture aimed to comment 
on womens work both badly paid and unpaid the 10 worstpaid jobs 
in the united kingdom are jobs traditionally done by women and 
such pressures could drive some women into prostitution 
one councillor who agreed was mrs fitzsimmons who saw it as 
a tribute to workingclass women miss paisley herself a 
painter also praised it 
this uncommon agreement between a paisley unionist committed to 
britain and an ira supporter pledged to driving britain out of 
northern ireland was more than belfast headline writers could 
resist at that point as the belfast political journal 
fortnight put it unionist knees jerked 
millars committee concluded that most people would see the 
sculpture as a memorial to prostitution and an insult to working 
women his mother among them who despite poverty retained high 
moral standards 
that set the stage for tuesdays battle in the council hall 
whose aisle separates 51 protestant and catholic councillors into 
two arrays of factions which feud with each other as well as within 
themselves 
hardline democratic unionists like miss paisley sit with more 
moderate ulster unionists like millar plus two independent 
unionists one protestant unionist and one progressive unionist 
the catholics are divided among the moderate social democratic and 
labor party its avowed enemy sinn fein and one member of the 
radical leftwing workers party 
a halfdozen members of the alliance the only mixed 
catholicprotestant party fit in where they can protestant 
councillors have been known to blow rape whistles to drown out sinn 
fein opponents or to toss coins at each other as judas 
gestures 
tuesdays session was mild by these standards with miss paisley 
excoriating millar as well as mrs fitzsimmons who sits with the 
irasinn fein scum 
i congratulate louise walsh for her work because it has 
exposed the stench of religious hypocrisy surrounding the arts for 
too long miss paisley said 
i would prefer said ulster unionist jim kirkpatrick to 
see a statue of women bringing up children alone due to the 
murderous activities of sinn fein 
former lord mayor sammy wilson of the democratic unionist party 
said the debate has been full of cant and hypocrisy and has more 
to do with people looking for a cheap election gimmick 
whatever rhonda paisley thought millar said her father had 
joined three other ministers in signing a letter opposing the 
sculpture 
the letter made it quite clear it was opposed to the erection 
that was the term they used of the statue millar said 
a motion to support the statue and condemn sinn fein in the 
bargain failed 2213

dozens of journalists for the official media 
began a petition drive wednesday and made plans to demonstrate in 
an unprecedented open rebellion against government censorship 
the reporters demanded the reinstatement of the editor of 
chinas most outspoken newspaper who was fired last week 
but they also called for a dialogue with government officials on 
broader issues of censorship reflecting increasing dissatisfaction 
with a media system in which much of their work is never released 
the reporters many of whom are members of the ruling communist 
party said their action was prompted in part by tight government 
limits on reporting of student protests over the past few weeks 
the students have called for press freedom and other democratic 
reforms but only a few newspapers have reported the scale and 
popularity of their marches 
we all know there is no press freedom in our country and that 
we reporters all want press freedom a reporter for the economic 
studies weekly told a gathering of about 60 colleagues at the lu 
xun museum in beijing 
lu xun was a short story writer and essayist famous for his 
sharp criticism of the government in the 1920s and 1930s 
the reporters from all of chinas leading papers including the 
party mouthpiece the peoples daily expressed anger over the 
firing of qin benli editor of the shanghaibased weekly the world 
economic herald 
shanghai officials fired qin for violations of discipline 
after he refused to alter the papers april 24 edition the issue 
contained articles that called for a reassessment of late party 
chief hu yaobang who was ousted in 1987 allegedly for being too 
liberal shanghai officials said the articles were likely to 
cause disturbances 
hus death april 15 sparked marches sitins and a class boycott 
by tens of thousands of college students in the largest protest in 
40 years of communist rule 
the reporters drafted a letter to be sent to government and 
party leaders demanding qins reinstatement an open apology by 
shanghai officials and a dialogue with officials on illegal 
interference in reporting 
if we can achieve our goals regarding the world economic 
herald then we believe we will have advanced a step in our 
striving for press freedom in our country said the economic 
studies weekly reporter who like many others did not want his name 
used 
the reporters at the meeting promised to collect signatures at 
their workplaces 
they also made plans to demonstrate thursday outside the offices 
of the staterun xinhua news agency which generally sets the line 
for other official media to follow in reporting sensitive stories 
thursday is the 70th anniversary of a 1919 student protest that 
began what became known as the may fourth movement a campaign 
against foreign imperialism and for scientific and democratic 
reform it was chinas first student protest 
the current student protesters have carried banners declaring 
the press should speak the truth and shouted the peoples 
daily complete nonsense 
its exciting the intellectuals in china wont stand more 
pressure from the government said a tv journalist there is 
strict censorship every day 
she said reports were held up for hours sometimes days by 
lots of officials who want to say yes or no on each one even 
if the content is not particularly sensitive 
science and technology daily was the first to break a media 
blackout on the student protests when it said that students 
gathered to mourn hu also were chanting slogans for democracy and 
freedom the papers editors agreed to publish the report only 
after the reporters threatened to resign en masse 
the peasants daily beijing youth news and chinese womens news 
each have reported once on the protests with enough detail to give 
readers an idea of the unprecedented size and daringness of them 
other papers have carried only sparse understated xinhua reports 
dozens of chinese reporters have covered the protests but said 
their editors have tossed out their reports 
one photographer asked at a protest why he was bothering to 
take pictures replied for history

americas people statistically speaking are 
a just shade older than theyve ever been before with the median 
age in the united states reaching a record 323 years the census 
bureau reported wednesday 
that means half of all the people living in the country were 
older than 323 years and half younger as of last july 1 this is 
up from the median age of 321 a year earlier 
by states in terms of the median age nebraska and north 
carolina are in the middle while the oldest americans are in 
florida and the youngest in utah 
the maturing of the massive baby boom generation born in the 
years following world war ii is raising the nations median age 
census officials and other analysts have noted 
this group forms the largest segment of the population and as it 
ages the median age is pulled along census demographer ed byerly 
said in a telephone interview 
after years of climbing gradually as life spans increased the 
median age reached 30 for the first time in the 1950 census when 
it was 302 years 
but then the full force of the baby boom began to occur and the 
large number of children in the population pulled the median down 
for two decades 
in 1980 the median edged back up to 30 again and has continued 
climbing since then as the baby boomers pursued careers and 
education and postponed having families creating what some 
statisticians call a baby bust 
in the last few years total births have begun rising as aging 
baby boomers began having children but those numbers remain too 
small to have a major impact on the national median byerly said 
retirementhaven florida remains the state with the oldest 
population with a median age of 364 years up from 363 years in 
1987 
following florida the highest median ages were reported for the 
large industrial states in the northeast with new jersey second at 
345 years followed by connecticut and pennsylvania at 344 
indeed the northeast has the highest median age of the four 
regions at 339 years next is the midwest at 323 same as the 
national figure followed by the south 32 and the west 316 
the state with the youngest residents remains utah where half 
of the population is under 257 years and half over a year 
earlier utahs median age was 255 
next lowest is alaska with a median figure of 287 years 
two states nebraska and north carolina match the national 
median age while the populations of 20 states and the district of 
columbia are older than the nation as a whole the remaining 28 
states have median ages younger than that of the country 
here is a look at the nations median age through the years

business productivity rose at an annual rate 
of 05 percent in the first quarter of 1989 with manufacturing 
workers significantly increasing their perhour output the 
government reported wednesday 
overall output in nonfarm business rose at a rate of 36 
percent in the first quarter while hours worked climbed 31 
percent leaving the halfpercent productivity gain the labor 
department said the department revised the fourthquarter nonfarm 
productivity gain to an annual rate of 1 percent up from the 01 
percent initially reported 
all of the figures were seasonally adjusted 
the gains were marked in manufacturing productivity improved 
38 percent in the first quarter from the final three months of 
1988 because manufacturing workers increased their output by 46 
percent while the number of hours worked grew by only 08 percent 
the data essentially confirmed figures in the governments 
recent reports on the gross national product and employment costs 
productivity output per hour for all workers is an indicator 
of the efficiency of american business because of labor shortages 
particularly in skilled jobs economists have been predicting wages 
will rise faster and significant productivity gains will be needed 
to curb inflation 
still there were signs in wednesdays report that wage gains 
are not outpacing inflation in general 
the labor department reported that hourly compensation in 
nonfarm business rose 57 percent in the first quarter but real 
hourly compensation which takes into account the increase in 
consumer prices in that period grew by only 03 percent for all 
of 1988 hourly compensation adjusted to factor in consumer 
inflation rose a revised 04 percent the department said 
in manufacturing real hourly compensation lagged 06 percent 
behind inflation in 1988 and 12 percent behind in the first 
quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 1988 according to the 
government data 
in a separate gauge the government reported that unit labor 
costs obtained by dividing compensation by output rose 52 
percent in the first quarter from the previous three months and 49 
percent compared to the first quarter of 1988 
the improved productivity in manufacturing in the first quarter 
included a gain of 36 percent for durable goods and 4 percent for 
nondurables 
the report included revised productivity data for 1988 with the 
government reporting overall nonfarm productivity improved 15 
percent over the year as output increased 52 percent while total 
hours worked grew 37 percent 
the government reported overall business productivity 
including farming increased at a 35 percent annual rate in the 
first quarter but that figure is heavily influenced by the 
agricultural rebound after last years drought productivity had 
declined 1 percent in the overall business category in the final 
quarter of 1988

thirteen infants died in a twoweek period in an 
armenian hospital where cockroaches scuttled around the cabinets 
and doctors set mousetraps under the operating table a newspaper 
revealed 
in a blistering attack that accused officials of indifference 
incompetence and a coverup the armenian newspaper kommunist said 
25 children born at the krupskaya scientificresearch institute in 
the capital of yerevan had died this year including 13 alone in 
the first two weeks of march 
in another yerevan maternity hospital three children died 
because they were given overdoses of medicine according to the 
april 29 edition of the newspaper that reached moscow on wednesday 
a government commission established that many of the infants 
died of infections caused by unsanitary conditions on the 
operating table in the birth area in areas for premature babies 
on nipples oxygen masks breathing tubes and even on medical 
lamps 
mothers say cockroaches scuttle around the cabinets and under 
the operating table there is a mousetrap kommunist reported 
the commission determined that about half of the 13 children who 
died in march were among the highestrisk group of newborns but 
that at least five or six of these children did not have to 
die the newspaper said 
it said nothing about the 12 other children born at the 
institute who have died this year 
the paper said the institute was closed its director gg 
okoev was fired and other senior personnel were demoted 
in an earlier interview the paper said okoev had blamed the 
high death rate on the highrisk nature of its patients and a flu 
epidemic among the mothers 
citing the case of the three other children who were given 
overdoses of medicine the newspaper demanded is this 
coincidence or is it the system a deeper and more serious 
discussion is needed here 
after many years of not publishing such statistics the official 
press said a year ago the infant mortality rate was about 25 per 
1000 live births in some areas of central asia it is as high as 
70 per 1000 the infant mortality rate in the united states in 
1986 was 103 per 1000 
the report came after other reports of abuse and neglect in 
recent months at maternity hospitals that shocked soviets 
officials said in march that 49 mothers and babies had been 
infected with the aids virus at a hospital in elista by nurses who 
used unsterile syringes 
soviet officials acknowledge the free system of health care 
often is poor and they are putting more money aside to improve it 
the tass news agency wednesday quoted health minister yevgeny 
chazov as saying that much of that money would be targeted at care 
for mothers and children 
considering the lag of mother and child care centers it has 
been decided to spend 40 percent of public healths capital 
investments for the development of these institutions tass said 
it said there has been a drop in infant mortality and infectious 
diseases in the past two years 
but kommunist said the infant deaths at the yerevan institute 
were not so much caused by lack of good equipment as the 
indifference of hospital and city health workers 
out of dozens of people in responsible positions receiving a 
salary precisely to spot dangerous infections on time no one saw 
it even when children started to die from it the paper said 
how could it happen that they didnt notice a group infection 
and in the end the deaths of a group of children they didnt know 
or maybe they knew but kept silent maybe they simply were afraid 
to lose their comfortable chairs where it is very prestigious to 
sit it said 
in any case such inertia is deeply immoral if not 
criminal it said

defense secretary dick cheney today played 
down an apparent disparity between his assessment of soviet 
president mikhail gorbachevs chances of implementing reforms and 
the opinion held by president bush 
the president and i were in a meeting yesterday and frankly 
chuckled at what has developed by way of press commentary on views 
that we have expressed we do not perceive a significant difference 
in terms of our views of the situation with respect to the soviet 
union cheney told the senate armed services committee 
the defense secretary who has been on the job for less than two 
months created a stir last week when he predicted that gorbachev 
would fail at instituting reforms in the soviet union and would be 
replaced by a hardliner 
if i had to guess today i would guess ultimately he would 
fail cheney said in a weekend television interview 
he also said the united states should not take any unilateral 
steps such as removing any of the 324000 us troops stationed in 
western europe in response to changes in the soviet union 
bush secretary of state james a baker iii and white house 
chief of staff john sununu quickly offered more hopeful assessments 
about gorbachevs liberalization efforts although they did not 
publicly rebuke cheney 
the defense secretary conceded today that he responded 
previously the other day perhaps with more candor than was 
warranted about my view somewhat pessimistic concerning mr 
gorbachevs prospect for achieving his reforms 
the president has expressed the hope those reforms will be 
successful we dont see those as contradictory statements 
cheney said 
asked by sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the 
armed services committee whether there was a fundamental 
difference between bushs approach to defense and his own cheney 
replied this is his budget i presented today

desperate times call for desperate measures 
in the oral roberts ministry as the elder statesman of television 
evangelism struggles to raise more than 4 million by saturday to 
save his religious empire 
roberts said in late march he had five weeks to raise 11 
million to pay pastdue bills or creditors would start 
dismantling the ministry richard roberts the evangelists son 
said more than 4 million still is needed by saturday when oral 
roberts university graduates nearly 1000 of its 4300 students 
roberts announced tuesday he was pulling the universitys 
athletic teams out of ncaa competition and applying for admission 
in the national association of intercollegiate athletics to save 
money he estimated that would save 500000 to 1 million a year 
roberts who once said nationally ranked ncaa teams could help 
showcase his evangelical university said the decision was an 
indication to supporters of the sacrifices necessary to save the 
ministry 
when they see that ive made this painful decision i think 
they will realize how serious our problem is and will come 
through he told the tulsa world 
the decision effective immediately ended the chances of 
postseason tournament play for the universitys 3618 baseball 
team which had hopes of a regional playoff bid with six games left 
in the season 
to work that long and that hard and to have an outside force 
come in and take it away from you thats hard said brett louis 
a sophomore catcher and designated hitter 
weve been facing the worst financial crisis in the history of 
this ministry richard roberts said were not out here in 
tulsa crying wolf weve got a sincere problem 
there have been other financial crises that forced cutbacks 
roberts dropped the universitys law school in 1985 and dental 
school in 1986 and turned over the city of faith medical centers 
clinic operation to an independent doctors group in 1987 last 
year the ministry took its television programs off 125 stations and 
the university scaled down an 8 million scholarship program for 
medical students 
everybody misses one large point said mark swadener chief 
financial officer for the ministry they think we like to raise 
money it is absolutely the opposite we dont like to come to you 
and ask for money we dont like to come to you because we dont 
want to be your problem we want to be your solution 
roberts blames the wellpublicized sins of fellow evangelists 
jim bakker and jimmy swaggart for his ministrys woes citing a 
spirit of skepticism that has discouraged the oncefaithful 
roberts claims donations have tumbled steadily since the 1987 
scandal involving bakker and his ptl ministry from 5 million a 
month to 27 million 
but roberts has had his share of controversy in his 41yearold 
ministry including claims of seeing a 900foot jesus wrestling 
matches with the devil and a lifeordeath ultimatum from god to 
raise 8 million for the medical school scholarship program in 1987 
nevertheless the 71yearold tent preacher who pioneered 
television evangelism says he is willing to pay any price to bring 
supporters back to his ministry 
this is an awful thing for me to say but id be willing to 
lose my soul i believe to save oral roberts university he said 
roberts who built his 500 million evangelical kingdom on the 
credo expect a miracle has managed to meet the challenge more 
than once in the last several years 
he has raised more than 20 million in special appeals since 
1986 including his controversial 8 million fund raiser that ended 
in march 1987 after he said god would call me home if he failed 
richard roberts said he believes the ministry will raise the 
money it needs and he still plans to leave for the soviet union 
next week on a sixday trip i refuse to give up i refuse to 
turn loose he said im expecting a miracle for oru

cancer researchers at the mayo clinic 
have found positive effects from twiceaday doses of radiation a 
variation from traditional onceaday treatments combined with 
cancerfighting drugs 
its premature to give results but this approach of 
twiceaday radiation with or without chemotherapy appears to be 
one of the most promising approaches we have edward shaw a 
radiation oncologist told a seminar on smoking last weekend 
the researchers have been studying the new approach for those 
who are not good candidates for surgery since the summer of 1987 
but the national cancer institute was hesitant tuesday to 
endorse the new treatment saying the benefits must be shown to 
outweigh the problems it could inflict 
while its definitely something that needs to be looked into 
further twoaday treatments could disrupt patients lives by 
requiring them to remain hospitalized said spokeswoman kara smigel 
those getting onceaday treatment are usually outpatients and 
can live relatively normal lives she said 
about 155000 people will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 1989 
of those about twothirds will not be good candidates for surgery 
if patients receive two radiation treatments daily lower doses 
may spare the tissue surrounding fastgrowing cancers shaw said 
traditional radiation treatment for lung cancer calls for radiation 
once a day five days a week for six weeks 
that said shaw will produce a 5 percent survival rate meaning 
5 percent of the patients receiving the treatment will be alive in 
five years twenty percent will be alive after two years the 
average survival will be nine months 
most people die from the spread of the cancer to other areas 
such as the brain liver and bones shaw said 
i hate to get too excited too soon but these people are doing 
really well shaw said this is probably the most exciting 
potential development i have seen in inoperable lung cancer in 
years 
a 20patient pilot program using twiceaday radiation will 
begin in about six weeks the next stage will be to compare 
standard treatment with twiceaday radiation and twiceaday 
radiation with chemotherapy researchers should have some idea of 
the effectiveness of the treatment within four or five years

an adult community has won the 
right to evict a toddler in a test of a federal law aimed at 
preventing age discrimination in housing 
pasco circuit judge lawrence keough gave vincent malloy 30 days 
to remove his son johnny who turns 2 this week from arborwood at 
summertree a 289unit community for adults 55 and older 
after a threehour nonjury trial keough decided tuesday that 
the subdivision fits exceptions to the newly amended fair housing 
act which took effect march 12 and upheld the associations age 
restriction as legal 
the law includes exemptions for retirement communities if 80 
percent of the households have at least one person age 55 or older 
and if facilities and services are provided for them 
arborwood attorney michael brudny said the subdivision meets 
both requirements 
malloy represented himself saying he could have afforded a 
lawyer but chose not to do so because others similarly affected 
might not be able to afford one 
to decide on their part youre deciding against all the 
people that congress tried to protect with this law and youre 
also deciding against all the people 55 and up who like children 
malloy told the judge in his closing agrument 
malloy said he will honor the order and expects to move to 
another home five miles away he has arranged to buy 
he originally bought the 90000 arborwood home for his 
80yearold father who died in december 1985 before the house was 
finished malloy said he and his son moved to arborwood last june 
after he divorced the boys mother he said he lived there two 
weeks before receiving notice from the homeowners group to move 
earlier this year keough rejected a bid by the association to 
evict the child and said the subdivisions original restriction 
against minors residents younger than 18 would become illegal 
when the fair housing law took effect the arborwood association 
amended its bylaws to become a 55andolder community

the former chancellor of the 
university of california santa barbara continues to receive his 
6800amonth salary 10 months after being convicted of 
embezzling 250000 in campus funds 
a campus discipline review process has yet to decide the future 
of robert huttenback who was suspended indefinitely in september 
as a tenured history professor 
many professors and students have expressed outrage that the 
university continues to pay huttenback 
this year there are 2400 freshmen who are unable to take 
required freshman english courses because the university is too 
short of money to provide those courses said john reiff who 
teaches freshman composition so its terribly puzzling and 
distressing to pay a convicted felon for not teaching 
its disgraceful that we continue to pay a man who has been 
convicted of stealing from us said student body president javier 
lafianza 
john myers chairman of the fivemember committee of privilege 
and tenure said the panel has not made a recommendation on 
huttenback because this is a very complicated matter that has to 
be done with a great deal of thought 
huttenback resigned as chancellor in july 1986 but continued to 
teach history he was later convicted of embezzlement and income 
tax evasion in connection with embezzling school funds to make 
repairs at his home 
he was fined 60000 placed on five years probation and 
ordered to perform 1000 hours of community service he is 
appealing his sentence

the amount of radioactive dust released from a 
uraniumprocessing plant in ohio may be two to six times greater 
than estimated because of inherently deceptive recordkeeping 
a consultant said wednesday 
the consultants report was prepared for a lawsuit to be heard 
next month against the former operator of the energy department 
plant at fernald ohio where the government says an extensive 
cleanup effort will be required over the next decade 
the plant on 1050 acres 18 miles northwest of cincinnati has 
processed uranium for nuclear weapons since 1952 during which the 
government estimates as much as 552000 pounds of radioactive 
uranium dust may have been released into the air 
but a report released wednesday by the institute for energy and 
environmental research said the government estimates are far too 
low based on evidence gathered as part of the lawsuit from 
depositions and internal plant documents 
arjun makhijani an engineer and coauthor of the report said 
as much as 31 million pounds of uranium particles may have been 
released from the plant since it opened in 1952 even using 
conservative estimates the releases likely significantly exceed 
the government estimates he suggested 
chris sankey a spokeswoman for the energy department said the 
department does not necessarily dispute the groups figures but 
will not agree with them either she said the department does not 
want to discuss the new findings in detail because of the trial 
scheduled to begin june 5 
officials of westinghouse materials co of ohio the plants 
current operator which officially took over operation in january 
1986 declined comment on the consultants report until the company 
can get a copy and read it 
the suit alleges that national lead of ohio which had operated 
the plant created a health hazard and reduced property values near 
the plant because of the release of radioactive particles 
makhijani said the higher estimates of radioactive releases over 
37 years of plant operation are based on internal plant documents 
and statements by officials and a computer analysis of 
radioactivity levels in soil within a fivemile radius of the plant 
the official estimates cited so far by the government of 
cumulative releases of uranium to the air from this plant are based 
in part on fabricated data and what plant documents themselves 
describe as an inherently deceptive method of calculating some 
of the releases wrote makhijani 
the report cited a court deposition by michael w boback former 
head of industrial hygiene and radiation at the plant that stack 
pollution filters regularly were not examined during long periods 
of time but zero loss of radioactive particles nevertheless 
were entered into release records 
the report said no adequate accounting was made of radioactive 
releases from areas not specifically monitored although internal 
documents show such releases were much greater than estimated by 
the government one memo cites extensive concern about radioactive 
dust leaking from equipment in areas not officially being monitored 
a bucket was placed under the largest leak to help contain the 
spilled dust from one piece of equipment a memo says 
a spot check showed releases from unmonitored areas in a single 
month to exceed all releases attributed to such sources by the 
government over the entire 37year period the report said 
the report said releases from stack scrubbers were based on an 
assumption that they were highly efficient and in good working 
condition although internal documents show scrubbers in disrepair 
and corroding 
we have long suspected that the stack and scrubber losses from 
plant 8 one of the buildings at the facility are far greater than 
are reported by the health and safety division said a june 4 
1964 plant memo cited in the report a 1970 memo referred to 
problems with another scrubber which it said was badly corroded 
and does not perform required scrubber functions 
a computer analysis of soil samples within five miles of the 
plant conducted as part of the consultants investigation 
indicated levels of radiation on average eight times greater than 
would be expected with the levels of release cited by the 
government said makhijani

importing books and other publications to the 
soviet union is purely a commercial proposition unhindered by 
political considerations a highranking soviet official said 
wednesday 
dmitry mamleev deputy head of the soviet state committee for 
publishing and the book trade also said exchanges between 
americans and soviets in the publishing world are booming thanks to 
glasnost 
there is no problem with political issues now mamleev said 
at a news conference during a 35nation forum on the flow of 
information between east and west this is purely a commercial 
issue now 
mamleev who introduced himself as a journalist said 12 joint 
ventures have been created recently for distributing books he 
cited only sovietpolish and sovietbulgarian examples of 
cooperation however 
he denied that censorship existed in the soviet union saying 
the only ban was on publication of state secrets 
due to glasnost the new soviet policy of openness all 
publishing houses were independent he said 
despite a paper shortage he said 2 billion books and 84000 
new titles were being published every year 
speaking of exchanges with americans mamleev said two years 
ago we started at a level below zero today i dont know how many 
of my publishers are in the states there are so many 
as part of the limited importation of foreign magazines and 
newspapers begun last fall he said 1000 copies of time magazine 
recently went on sale 
the newspaper usa today is set to follow and his committee is 
negotiating an exchange of the science magazine omni for its soviet 
counterpart science in the ussr 
until recently soviet customs inspectors searched the bags of 
arriving tourists to confiscate western publications 
on tuesday us delegation member judith ingram criticized the 
soviet unions decision to allow the public to attend the moscow 
international book fair in september for only two days of its seven 
dayrun 
ms ingram expressed us concern that this period will not be 
long enough to accommodate the many soviet citizens who depend on 
this biennial event to acquint themselves with world literature 
she also cited the case of vladimir ryabakon a russian orthodox 
christian whose religious literature was confiscated upon his 
return to the soviet union in december despite official soviet 
media articles announcing the lifting of all limitations on 
importing such material 
she said us delegates hoped that the positive changes toward 
freedom of expression seen in poland hungary and to some 
extent in the soviet union would also reach other east bloc 
countries where they were needed such as bulgaria and romania 
the monthlong conference known as the information forum ends

president bush today ruled out negotiations 
with the soviet union on shortrange nuclear missiles saying such 
talks would be a mistake 
he said the weapons must be kept in west germany and made more 
powerful in order to deter soviet attack 
bush outlined his position to prime minister gro harlem 
brundtland in an hourlong white house meeting she stressed a need 
to find commmon ground with west german chancellor helmut kohl 
who wants the missiles scaled back and eventually eliminated 
bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater suggested the disagreement 
was not likely to be resolved before bush kohl and the leaders of 
the 14 other north atlantic treaty organization countries attend a 
summit meeting in brussels may 2930 
we will continue to discuss it but we are very firm in our 
position fitzwater said 
the centerpiece of the summit is celebration of the 40th 
anniversary of the western alliance fitzwater said we will have 
a healthy debate if a solution remains elusive but he said i 
dont think it will damage the basic strength of nato 
quoting bush the spokesman said the president had told the 
norwegian leader that the shortrange lance missiles were 
essential to natos strategy of deterring an attack by the 
warsaw pact and that such systems must be kept up to date 
moreover fitzwater said bush told mrs brundtland that 
entering into arms control negotiations on shortrange nuclear 
forces with the soviet union would be a mistake 
the statement appeared to rule out negotiations to eliminate the 
lances under any circumstances fitzwater said there could be no 
consideration of such talks at least until after the warsaw pact 
reduced its conventional forces in europe 
mrs brundtland taking an optimistic view had predicted after 
seeing bush that the nato allies would find a common ground 
between conflicting us and west german positions on the 
shortrange nuclear missiles 
i tried to listen very seriously to the concerns and the 
positions of the american administration the norwegian leader 
said 
while norway shares the us view that the warsaw pacts edge in 
conventional weapons should be trimmed mrs brundtland made it 
clear her government is closer to the west german stand on the 
missiles 
i think he knows that she said of bush whose hopes for a 
successful first summit meeting with the nato allies scheduled for 
brusssels may 2930 are clouded by differences with west german 
chancellor helmut kohl 
bush wants to more than triple the range of usbuilt lance 
missiles in west germany kohl who is up for reelection next year 
before a disarmamentinclined electorate wants the program delayed 
and negotiations held between the united states and the soviet 
union to scale back shortrange nuclear rockets 
i think we will see the nato summit will find common ground by 
continuing discussions in the weeks before that meeting mrs 
brundtland said 
if not the norwegian leader said the 16 allied leaders could 
accomplish the task in brussels there is always something left 
for political leaders to do she said 
mrs brundtland said the elements of a compromise should include 
a linkage between nonnuclear and nulcear weapons we have to 
be very clear in our requirements to the soviets on reducing 
conventional arms she said 
the prime minister said the bush administration felt it had been 
taken by surprise by the west german demand for speedy negotiations 
over the lance missiles but these change are a fact and i think 
we need to find common ground mrs brundtland said 
us officials said on tuesday the bush administration was 
considering a compromise in which the united states would develop a 
nonnuclear missile jointly with the west germans 
this would require a reversal of a decision by bonn in february 
to stop research and development on the fk90 missile which was 
classified as a tactical weapon with a range below 300 miles 
a us official said the missile could target warsaw pact 
airfields and other military installations now targeted by the 
lances 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
development of the nonnuclear missile was under consideration at 
nato headquarters in brussels and at the pentagon it would give 
us greater flexibility he said 
another option under discussion within the alliance is a 
declaration at the brussels summit meeting may 2930 proposing to 
scale back the lance missiles but only after their range is more 
than tripled and provided the soviets reduce their shortrange 
rockets as well 
mrs brundtland said at a news conference tuesday that what we 
need now is to look for the common ground to look for what will be 
a sensible and coherent way of addressing the issues both of arms 
control and disarmament 
the prime minister said her governments position is that all 
kinds of weapons should be on the table in arms control and 
disarmament talks 
norway has lined up with west germany in seeking a delay in 
extending the range of the lances to about 250 miles 
mrs brundtland said norway also would like to see natos agenda 
expanded to deal with environmental and energy problems we will 
all be hurt by climate and atmosphere changes wherever we live on 
the globe she said

a year after the amnesty application deadline 
for illegal aliens immigration authorities are preparing to 
process 31 million requests from foreigners asking to become 
permanent us residents 
the immigration and naturalization service is gearing up for the 
second phase of the amnesty program amid charges from advocacy 
groups that it is not doing enough to inform aliens of their 
obligation to apply for permanent residency if they want to stay in 
the united states legally 
but ins officials say 60 percent of those already eligible to 
apply for permanent residency have done so and they expect 97 
percent to do so by the end of the program 
some advocacy organizations contend that ins should do a better 
job of notifying eligible aliens they must apply for permanent 
residency or face deportation 
there is a big concern that people will unwittingly lose their 
chance for permanent residency because they dont know they have to 
take the next step said arthur c helton an attorney for the 
lawyers committee for human rights 
but a year after it stopped taking amnesty applications for 
temporary residence on may 4 1988 closing the 12month 
application period the ins says it is well prepared to process the 
papers of the millions of aliens who will eventually become 
eligible to apply for permanent residency 
the ins has received 31 million applications for amnesty under 
the general legalization and the special agricultural worker 
provisions of the 1986 immigration reform and control act 
so far it has approved nearly 18 million applications for 
temporary residency while denying about 70000 
legalized aliens become eligible to apply for permament resident 
status 18 months after their temporary residency is approved by the 
ins 
the aliens then have a year to submit their applications and 
could become subject to deportation if they do not file the 
necessary papers on time 
at a briefing wednesday ins commissioner alan nelson told 
reporters that applications for permanent residency are on the 
rise with about 269000 returned so far 
nelson said the process is being simplified to allow those with 
temporary resident permits to submit their applications at any time 
rather than waiting 18 months 
this provides additional time in which to file for permanent 
residency and removes any possibility of confusion nelson said 
ins officials also dispute contentions that its notification 
program is insufficient 
the elaborate 11 million public relations campaign waged two 
years ago to announce the amnesty program was necessary because 
we were trying to hit a target behind a smokescreen said 
richard e norton associate ins commissioner for examinations 
with computerized mailings however general advertising appeals 
are no longer necessary because we are reaching out directly to 
these people norton said 
of the people who became eligible to apply last november for 
permanent residency 70 percent have submitted their applications 
he said 
overall the application rate is 60 percent the ins projects 
that 97 percent of eligible aliens will eventually apply to stay in 
the united states norton said 
nelson credited sanctions against employers who hire illegal 
aliens with what he called a significant drop in arrests along the 
usmexican border 
in the year before the immigration law was enacted ins and us 
border patrol agents arrested 16 million illegal aliens trying to 
cross the southern border 
the arrest rate is about onethird lower this year than last 
when 940670 people were stopped at the border 
the trend continues to demonstrate that the law is working 
nelson said 
so far the ins has issued 4016 citations to companies alleged 
to have hired illegal aliens and has assessed more than 7 million 
in fines he said

using fuels such as methanol instead of 
gasoline to power cars could boost the risk of global warming 
according to a study given to automotive engineers wednesday 
the study said that stringent government controls on emissions 
of carbon dioxide and other gases contributing to warming of the 
earth combined with policies discouraging travel by car could 
lessen the impact of alternate fuels on the climate 
the study by independent consultant michael walsh was presented 
at the annual meeting of the society of automotive engineers 
alternate fuels such as methanol are derived from coal natural 
gas and plants and are used instead of gasoline to fuel cars 
vehicles able to burn such fuels have been built as prototypes by 
major us automakers 
however some alternatives to gasoline create high levels of 
carbon dioxide when burned that gas along with others can 
inhibit the movement of the suns heat from the atmosphere back 
into space 
some scientists have predicted that if present trends continue 
the earths atmosphere will have warmed on average by several 
degrees by the middle of the next century with possible 
devastating effects on agriculture and the environment 
alternate fuels could increase carbon dioxide emissions 
substantially the study said the reason is that coal could be 
used as a feedstock to manufacture methanol and if it were to do 
so overall carbon dioxide emissions would approximately double per 
mile driven assuming that vehicles achieved the same energy 
efficiency as with conventional fuels 
moreover the adoption of methanol commercially would encourage 
continued use of fossil fuels and discourage research into 
electrical power plants and other alternatives the study said 
the study said the increased carbon dioxide output could be 
countered by adopting standards to lower emissions by the worlds 
vehicles by 20 percent in the short term and 50 percent over a 
longer term 
also the study said energy prices should be gradually increased 
significantly to hold down growth in the number of vehicles and to 
encourage individuals to purchase highly efficient vehicles and 
fuels and to make a lifestyle decision which will tend to 
minimize vehicle travel as well as other energy uses

orange county wants walt disney world to 
pay 3265 million to help improve roads heavily used by tourists 
traveling to the entertainment empire 
disney called the request unacceptable but agreed to 
negotiate with county officials wednesday under a growth management 
agreement with its major host county 
disneys research says that everyone goes to disney said 
county commissioner bill donegan adding that its time for the 
company to ante up 
the fiveyear road improvement plan proposed by county attorney 
harry stewart is the latest effort to get disney to pay for service 
demands the county contends are primarily caused by a construction 
boom at the 43squaremile tourist resort 
disney pays no impact fees for roads or services because of a 
special state law giving it autonomy from state or county 
regulations unlike other commercial developers it does not have 
to submit its building plans for state or county review 
disney officials contend its huge complex which contains magic 
kingdom epcot center the new disneymgm studios and numerous 
hotels restaurant and shops is selfcontained it builds and 
maintains its own roads and operates its own sewage and water 
systems and fire and security services 
disney said the 22 million it pays in property taxes to the 
county each year is sufficient because it needs few if any county 
services 
the county attorney said the 3265 million would represent 
threefourths of the expenses for widening and improving four 
sections of two roads leading to the resort 
the county would pay 115 million for construction because some 
of the traffic is not heading to disney stewart said

pope john paul ii on wednesday lamented 
that children are dying in africa and elsewhere in the third world 
because their governments are forced to spend their scarce cash on 
debt repayment 
in a speech to diplomats the pope appealed for new and 
courageous action by creditor nations to ease the 
multibilliondollar debt burdens of the worlds poorest nations 
the pope also kept up his attack on apartheid appealed for 
international support for the plan for namibian independence and 
urged solidarity with refugees 
on the sixth day of his nineday african pilgrimage the pope 
also flew to the depressed copperbelt mining region in central 
zambia and warned youths in lusakas sports stadium about 
materialism and marijuana smoking 
on the debt problem john paul urged mutual understanding and 
agreement between the debtor and creditor nations he stressed 
that creditor agencies should show sensitivity to the hardships 
faced by debtors 
is it merely a rhetorical question to ask how many infants and 
children die every day in africa because resources are now being 
swallowed up in debt repayment he said 
now is the time for a new and courageous international 
solidarity a solidarity not based on selfinterest but inspired 
and guided by a true concern for human beings 
john paul said efforts by developed and creditor countries to 
relieve debt repayment burdens were a step in the right 
direction but that much more remains to be done 
the popes message is particularly relevant in africa the 
continent comprising 28 of the worlds poorest nations recorded 
an external debt of 230 billion in 1988 zambia alone has 5 
billion in foreign debts 
turning to southern africa the pope said the world looks with 
hope to the unbacked plan for independence of namibia which 
has been under south african control for 74 years in a related 
accord south african and cuban troops are to be withdrawn from 
angola 
while namibia began a transition period toward independence on 
april 1 the plan was jeopardized when black nationalist guerrillas 
crossed the border from angola leading to new fighting 
to all those who head hear my voice i make an appeal that 
namibia the latest country in africa to become independent be

a study questions the conventional view of how 
mammals keep the biological clock in their brains synchronized with 
the 24hour day researchers say 
the socalled circadian clock governs a host of body processes 
and disruptions lead to such conditions as jet lag and some cases 
of insomnia 
scientists generally believe that in most mammals the brain 
maintains the clocks 24hour rhythm chiefly by monitoring light 
and darkness in the environment 
but the new study found that onset of darkness failed to exert 
its usual effect in hamsters if the animals were immobilized so 
the real clocksetting mechanism may be the physical activity that 
darkness usually causes in hamsters researchers suggested 
the work is presented in thursdays issue of the british journal 
nature by fred turek of northwestern university and o van reeth of 
the free university of brussels in belgium 
the paper is going to generate considerable controversy over 
the next year commented dale edgar director of the 
chronobiology and behavioral pharmacology laboratory at the sleep 
research center of the stanford university school of medicine 
but he said its relevance to humans was not clear the 
experiment has only been done in hamsters he stressed he also 
said that in humans social interaction and the scheduling of 
mealtimes strongly influence the setting of the clock 
he said previous research including his own has shown that the 
scheduling of physical activity can reset the clock in animals 
nobody knows whether that strategy can affect the human clock he 
said 
in the nature paper turek and van reeth reported that 
unrestrained hamsters showed the usual changes in their 24hour 
activity schedules in response to darkness or injections of the 
sleepingpill drug triazolam 
either treatment causes a burst of physical activity in 
hamsters and can advance or delay the clock setting depending on 
the time in the 24hour cycle at which it is given they said 
in contrast to its effect in humans triazolam increases 
physical activity in hamsters as does darkness either treatment 
can advance or delay the clock setting depending on the time in 
the 24hour cycle at which it is given researchers said 
but when animals were immobilized the effect of darkness was 
eliminated and the impact of triazolam was largely absent they 
reported hamsters were immobilized by placing them in a 
transparent tube 
edgar said it is not clear whether the clock is affected by the 
physical activity itself or the heightened wakefulness that 
accompanies the activity

a firsthand look at the plight of cambodian refugees thursday when 
he winds up a 12day foreign trip 
quayle flies to the embattled thaicambodian border where he 
will visit site b a sprawling camp inhabited by nearly 60000 
refugees under the control of guerrillas fighting the 
vietnambacked phnom penh government in cambodia 
the vice president accompanied by his wife is on the last leg 
of a 12day tour of australia indonesia singapore and thailand 
cambodias fate has been a dominant theme during the trip 
site b is the major camp controlled by forces loyal to prince 
norodom sihanouk the leader of a threeparty resistance coalition 
currently negotiating with the phnom penh government to end a 
decadelong guerrilla war which began after vietnams invasion of 
cambodia in late 1978 
in jakarta indonesia quayle met with sihanouk whom the united 
states wants to head a transition government after vietnam 
withdraws its troops this fall quayle told a news conference 
wednesday that the united states will not consider closer 
diplomatic ties with vietnam until that country removes itself 
from cambodia 
after his arrival in thailand his third southeast asian country 
in as many days quayle explained the basic us position on 
cambodia during a 50minute meeting with thai prime minister 
chatichai choonhavan and also stressed the importance the united 
states places on protection of copyrights perhaps the only major 
friction in otherwise strong relations between the two countries 
earlier this year the united states thailands major export 
market denied the country 165 million in duty free exports the 
action was taken after washington complained the thais had failed 
to honor intellectual property rights 
unlicensed reproductions of american video movies music 
cassettes designer clothes and computer software are made and 
openly sold in thailand american pharmaceutical products are 
similarly manufactured and distributed 
thai officials say laws exist to protect intellectual property 
but enforcement is still difficult the united states however is 
considering further and stiffer retaliatory measures 
thai government spokesman suvit yoadmanee quoted chatichai as 
telling quayle that good bilateral relations should not be marred 
by the united states taking drastic action on the issue he noted 
that the most recent negotiations had proceeded well 
while quayle met with the prime minister half a dozen 
university students attempted to hand quayle an open letter 
protesting further american economic retaliation claiming this 
would amount to overt intervention of thailands internal 
affairs 
thai security kept the students from entering government house 
where quayle and chatichai were meeting and the students 
circulated the letter among reporters and others 
quayle also met with foreign minister siddhi savetsila and had 
an audience with king bhumibol adulyadej and members of his family 
the vice president and his wife marilyn were then hosted at a 
dinner banquet

chief justice william h rehnquist in an 
extraordinary personal appearance before congress tried to rally 
support wednesday for raising federal judges salaries 30 percent 
becoming the first chief justice in some 50 years to testify 
before congress rehnquist acknowledged that many americans think 
federal judges already are paid handsomely 
but he called current judicial salaries inadequate and said they 
would cause more resignations from the bench more damage to the 
morale of those judges who remain and more difficulty in recruiting 
new judges 
rehnquist told the house post office and civil service committee 
that a 30 percent pay hike is needed immediately but chairman 
william ford dmich indicated the committee is not likely to 
take any action until next fall at the earliest 
proposed legislation backed by the rehnquistchaired us 
judicial conference would provide federal judges with a 30 percent 
pay raise and regular costofliving adjustments 
president bush has proposed a 25 percent increase along with a 
ban on speaking fees and a limit on outside earned income 
a 30 percent increase would boost the chief justices annual 
salary from 115000 to 149500 salaries of supreme court 
justices would rise from 110000 to 143000 appeals court judges 
from 95000 to 123000 and trial judges from 89500 to 116500 
there are about 700 active federal judges about 300 others are 
on senior status doing as much or as little work as they wish all 
receive the same raises 
responding to committee questions rehnquist said i realize 
that many people have difficulty understanding why people making 
89000 need 25 or 30 percent more i have wracked my brain 
about how to get this over to the american people 
he added i hope i have not overstated the case judges 
arent constantly saying how am i going to pay the rent thats 
not whats happening 
rehnquist called the proposed pay increase a partial recapture 
of the tremendous decline in purchasing power that has affected 
judicial salaries over the last 20 years 
he added i know there may be a feeling abroad that lawyers 
make too much money but so long as judges are recruited from 
lawyers we must take into consideration the fact of how much 
lawyers are paid 
rehnquist said current judicial salaries may not attract lawyers 
from the nations larger cities because they can earn much more in 
private practice i fear that is what is beginning to happen 
he said 
several committee members were clearly sympathetic 
rep constance morella rmd said federal judges are among 
the lowest paid attorneys in americas legal system today when 
age and experience levels are considered 
rep robert garcia dny said theres no question that the 
need is there i think the judges deserve a raise 
but rep pat schroeder dcolo pointedly told rehnquist 
this country has a great economic problem 
noting that representatives of the executive and legislative 
branches had preceded the chief justice in seeking support for 
wideranging pay increases schroeder said this hearing is the 
closing of the greed cycle i find this tragic 
rehnquist also emphasized the importance of routine 
costofliving adjustments in judicial salaries which he said 
could well obviate the need for the sort of sizable catchup 
increases being proposed 
currently federal judges receive the periodic raises given to 
most federal employees by congress 
congress historical reluctance to increase its own pay levels 
has often meant that costofliving increases for other senior 
government officials have also been denied rehnquist said 
federal judges actually have received costofliving increases 
in most years since 1975 during that period trial judges 
salaries have risen from 42000 to 89500 and appellate court 
salaries from 44600 to 95000 
last week five democratic and republican members of the house 
courts subcommittee advised a panel of leading judges that public 
protests likely would block any judicial pay raise unless 
nonworking senior judges were excluded the judges opposed such 
limits 
the associated press earlier this year reported previously 
unpublished federal figures showing that in 1987 some 20 percent of 
the then306 senior judges did no judicial work including former 
chief justice warren burger 
rep robert kastenmeier dwis and rep carlos moorhead 
rcalif chairman and ranking minority member on the subcommittee 
subsequently submitted legislation to bar pay raises other than 
costofliving increases from senior judges who carry less than 25 
percent of an active judges caseload 
supreme court spokeswoman toni house said it is believed that 
the last chief justice who testified before congress was charles 
evans hughes whose tenure lasted from 1930 to 1941

soon cho south koreas deputy prime minister 
and top economic planning officer said wednesday that increased 
us pressure on his country to open its markets and revalue its 
currency could spark even more instability in his violenceplagued 
nation 
the most pressing business for the government of korea is to 
restore order and establish the democratic system said soon in 
washington for meetings with congressional leaders and top bush 
administration officials 
soon spoke with reporters as the most recent wave of student 
unrest claimed the lives of six riot police in pusan a city about 
200 miles southeast of seoul the victims were set afire during one 
of the many violent protests that have prompted president roh 
taewoo to threaten the imposition of emergency measures 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said in a 
statement that the administration deplored the senseless violence 
that has led to this tragic and needless loss of life and urged 
all parties in south korea to refrain from further violence 
on trade matters the administration has charged south korea 
with erecting significant trade barriers to us products part of 
a process that could result in retaliation against nations refusing 
to open their doors to american goods 
the united states has also been pressuring south korea to allow 
its currency to rise in value in relation to the dollar as a way of 
making its goods more expensive on american markets and making us 
goods cheaper on south korean markets 
the south korean official is slated to meet thursday with 
treasury secretary nicholas brady those topics were sure to be 
discussed 
pointing out that his nation has been afflicted with neardaily 
demonstrations on the part of students farmers and workers soon 
said the united states is pressing korea very hard to further 
open its markets appreciate its currency and so on 
arguing that south korea has already made great strides in 
attempting to open its markets soon said us retaliation would be 
interpreted by the south korean public as too harsh in spite of 
the great effort that the korean government is making 
im sure that it would be adding to instability from which 
the korean government is already suffering soon said 
the radical student and dissident protestors are demanding the 
overthrow of rohs government but havent had broad public support 
because of their extremism and violent tactics they have been 
able however to form alliances with striking workers 
soon argued that the south korean government considers the 
present level of the won the south korean currency to be a 
fairly appropriate one and sees no reason to revalue it at 
present 
he disupted the contention made in an initial treasury 
department report last october that his nation has manipulated its 
currency to gain an unfair competitve advantage in world markets 
and he accused the us government of showing a lack of 
understanding on this matter 
he also faulted the united states for making oneway demands 
on trade matters saying that is not beneficial to the 
maintainance of good relations 
soon stressed however that his nation was more than willing to 
continue the dialogue to prevent inciting a trade war between the 
two countries and to maintain a cooperative relationship

senators urged the nations top trade 
negotiator on wednesday to resist pressure to omit japan from a 
target list being developed by the bush administration in an effort 
to open key world markets to american exports 
we would be amazed if japan with its whole panoply of trade 
barriers were not on the list sen john c danforth rmo 
said at a senate finance committee trade hearing 
us trade representative carla hills told the senators that the 
administration would use the negotiating tools contained in the 
1988 act vigorously but constructively to open markets combat 
unfair trade practices and persuade our trading partners to honor 
agreements 
in administering these provisions we will act as a surgeon 
using a scalpel to remove these trade barriers and promote a 
healthier trading system she said we will not use these tools 
to butcher the rules of the system we are trying to strengthen 
at issue is a report from hills due by the end of the month 
that must target specific countries for marketopening action and 
possible retaliation under the socalled super 301 section of the 
1988 trade law there reportedly is divided opinion within the 
administration over whether to include japan 
under the super 301 provision the us trade representative 
targets key countries for marketopening pressure if they fail to 
lower their barriers to american exports within 15 to 19 months 
the trade representative takes retaliatory steps such as tariffs 
and quotas to compensate the united states the president does 
have discretion to abort such steps in some cases 
the provision is called super 301 because it represents an 
extension of section 301 of the trade act which has long been the 
basic legal authority under which the president is authorized to 
retaliate against foreign countries for alleged unfair trade 
practices hills is due to unveil her list may 30 
i strongly support the idea and urge you to include japan in 
the super 301 category sen jay rockefeller dwva told 
hills he said that their market is not open to us in any way 
that it should be 
sen john heinz rpa noted that a longrunning dispute 
between the united states and japan over semiconductors remains 
unresolved 
if that isnt grounds for listing under super 301 what is 
heinz said 
under questioning from sen bob packwood rore hills said 
that great concern has been expressed by some officials of 
americas trading partners as the date for the list approaches and 
there has been a reaction among some others of more 
belligerence perhaps 
there is general anxiety she said 
asked by sen max baucus dmont about reports that foreign 
lobbying has been heavy at her office as other countries strive to 
stay off the list hills merely said weve had a good number of 
visitors 
she agreed with the view of sen daniel patrick moynihan 
dny that merely lowering barriers overseas is far from the 
answer to the nations trade problems 
we could open all the markets we have enumerated and it would 
not correct our trade deficit and i think we make a mistake not to 
tell the american people that she said to tell the american 
people that if you open all these markets that will take care of 
the trade deficit that is not true

i think we have some pretty good news said robert s kurtz 
assistant chief of surgery at metropolitan hospital

28yearold woman began responding tuesday and had spoken in a 
whisper to relatives and staff members raised two fingers when 
asked to do so and was able to read large signs printed with yes 
no and her name 
when a nurse told the patient tuesday that she would like to 
resume jogging the patient replied me too kurtz said at a

assault 
by the time she was found hours later she had lost 
threefourths of her blood and her temperature had fallen to 80 
degrees officials said 
she has been emerging gradually over the last couple of days 
or three days kurtz said we would still say she is in a 
delirium people in this stage will fluctuate 
when hospital staff flashed the signs and she responded three 
or four people started clapping i was one of them kurtz said 
duffy said the patient in all medical certainty will not 
remember the events of her accident and probably will not 
remember things that happened to her for a short period of the time 
before the attack 
kurtz has said it is unlikely she will ever fully recover 
kurtz said she lacks facial expression but manages what 
appears to be a smile from time to time

prime minister margaret thatcher on wednesday 
marked the 10th anniversary of her election cuddling her grandson 
and likening her combative style to a tigress under attack 
interviewed by the domestic press association agency the prime 
minister rejected the charge her style is confrontational saying 
most women defend themselves it is the female of the species 
it is the tigress and the lioness in you which tends to defend 
when attacked that may give the feeling that one is constantly in 
some kind of battle 
britains longest continuously serving prime minister this 
century also dismissed the latest opinion polls saying if you 
just set out to be liked you would be prepared to compromise on 
anything at any time and you would achieve nothing 
opponents looked back glumly to may 3 1979 when after a 
winter of strikes had left the dead unburied and garbage piled in 
the streets britons voted out the socialist labor party government 
of james callaghan 
mrs thatcher leader of the conservative party took office the 
next day may 4 becoming europes first woman prime minister she 
since has won two more terms pursuing a rightwing revolution that 
has emasculated labor unions and increased prosperity 
but critics charge thatcherism has made the poor poorer 
encouraged greed and divided the nation 
she has preached the gospel of conflict and division said 
roy hattersley deputy leader of the labor party she has 
chosen to govern with an arrogance and autocracy which amounts to 
an assault on our democratic rights 
in her interview the 63yearold mrs thatcher said everyone 
knows now that britain counts for something in the world at large 
that is the result of many other achievements 
earlier she posed on the steps of her 10 downing st residence 
cradling her grandson michael her son mark and his american 
wife diane brought the baby from their home in dallas 
isnt he beautiful isnt he good mrs thatcher cooed as 
she showed off the sleeping baby dressed in a blue and white 
sailor suit 
then she ate lunch at the savoy hotel where rankandfile 
conservative party legislators presented her with a silver bowl 
engraved with the emblems of england scotland wales and northern 
ireland 
also engraved was a tiny penguin a reminder of the 1982 war 
against argentina in which britain wrested back the disputed 
falkland islands in the south atlantic 
the anniversary has triggered a mass of media analyses of 
thatcherism opinion polls about the thatcher decade souvenirs and 
thatcher books 
these range from weighty biographies to a paperback jokebook 
sample margaret thatcher boasts that she is a selfmade woman 
that certainly relieves the almighty of a dreadful responsibility 
on thursday mrs thatchers 21 cabinet colleagues all male and 
including only three survivors of her first cabinet will host a 
dinner in her honor at 10 downing street 
to beat all records for length of service she would have to 
overtake lord liverpools 181227 tenure i think you might say 
well within reach a thatcher aide said sardonically wednesday 
whether they like it or not many britons agree 
a harris poll in londons liberal observer newspaper showed 58 
percent of those questioned want mrs thatcher to step down within 
a couple of years but only 7 percent believe she actually will 
a gallup poll showed 67 percent of respondents dislike mrs 
thatcher personally about the same as the 63 percent who said they 
respect her

the countdown marched smoothly 
wednesday toward a second attempt to launch the shuttle atlantis 
with a crew of five and a space probe destined for venus nasas 
only worry was a worsening weather forecast 
all in all things look good for a 148 pm launch tomorrow 
thursday and the start of our trip to venus launch test 
director albert sofge said of shuttle preparations 
the weather outlook however was not the greatest with 
forecasters saying wednesday afternoon there was a 40 percent 
chance that either rain or high winds would prevent a launch during 
the available 64minute launch period that was up from 30 percent 
in the morning and 20 percent two days ago 
the first launch attempt last friday was aborted just 31 seconds 
before the planned liftoff because of a short circuit in a fuel 
pump nasa said the delay cost about 300000 
the mission to take the magellan spacecraft into orbit will 
revive a us planetary program that has been dormant since the 
launch of pioneervenus in 1978 
after an 11year gap in the planetary program were anxious 
to get started said john h gerpheide project manager for 
magellan 
shuttle chief richard truly opened an afternoon news conference 
with here we are again and were ready to fly again weve 
fixed our problems 
the weather is not going to be as good as it was last friday 
but it appears it will be good 
air force capt thomas strange the shuttle meteorologist said 
there is a 40 percent chance of a violation of weather 
constraints 
he said the forecast called for a chance of rain showers but of 
more concern he said was the possibility of crosswinds of more 
than 14 mph that could be dangerous if the shuttle had to make an 
emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad 
on thursday the shuttle must be launched by 252 pm the end 
of a 64minute launch window in order to have magellan in the 
right position for a flight to venus if it isnt launched by may 
28 magellan will have to wait for two years before earth and venus 
are in the right position again 
technicians working around the clock replaced the fuel pump and 
a suspect fuel line in half the time expected enabling nasa to 
reschedule the launch for thursday at least a day earlier than 
officials thought was possible 
engineers had thought there was a leak in the fuel line that was 
replaced but tests turned up nothing they believe a vapor cloud 
seen spewing from the line thought at first to be gas was trapped 
water vapor 
sofge reported both new parts had been checked and certified for 
flight and that the engine compartment had been closed up the 
launch team prepared to pump 528000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and 
liquid oxygen into atlantis external fuel tank early thursday 
the five astronauts reviewed flight plans and honed their flying 
efficiency over central florida in t38 jet planes 
this time were going to see if we can get it right said 
david walker who will command the mission were extremely 
pleased the folks here at the cape were able to do such a good and 
quick job getting it ready to go again 
the other crew members are pilot ronald grabe and mission 
specialists mary cleave mark lee and norman thagard 
cleave and lee are to deploy magellan from the shuttles cargo 
hold six hours after launch an hour later a rocket will ignite to 
propel it on its 15month journey to venus 
magellan has a radar system powerful enough to pierce the dense 
sulfuric acid clouds shrouding venus and map its surface the 
mission costs 550 million not including the 225 million cost of 
the fourday shuttle flight 
magellans radar images should reveal details as small as 100 
yards across about the size of a football field this is 10 times 
sharper than previous pictures of the planet captured by two soviet 
craft in 1983

yasser arafat said wednesday the plo charter 
calling for the destruction of israel has been superseded by a 
declaration urging peaceful coexistence of the jewish state and a 
palestinian state 
the plo chief ending a twoday visit to france did not suggest 
any formal action to reword or scrap the hardline language in the 
25yearold charter and his statement elicited cynical responses 
from rightwing israeli leaders 
but french president francois mitterrand and other government 
leaders said arafats statements were a step toward clearing up the 
contradiction between the charter and more recent plo statements 
recognizing the existence of israel and renouncing terrorism 
arafat told a french radio interviewer he considers the plo 
charter to have been superseded by the palestinian declaration of 
independence passed in november the declaration urged the peaceful 
coexistence of palestine and israel 
aides to mitterrand speaking on condition of anonymity said 
french leaders repeatedly urged arafat to push for changes in the 
charter 
the plo chief tuesday described the plo charter as caduc 
which in french means outdated or null and void 
a radio interview wednesday urged him to clarify the statement 
and arafat responded that the appropriate word in english would be 
superseded 
when asked why he didnt use the word abrogated arafat 
responded it is not up to me to say that it is a decision that 
must come from the palestine national council 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said arafats statement if it is backed by words and deeds is a 
step in the right direction 
she urged formal action by the palestine national council the 
plos parliamentinexile to abrogate or amend the charter 
george habash head of the marxist popular front for the 
liberation of palestine one of the hardline plo factions said he 
was horrified by arafats comments regarding the plo charter 
we shall show arafat and the world that the plo charter 
remains very well alive habash said arafat has no right to 
take such decisions 
ovadia sofer israels ambassador to france called arafats 
statement a rhetorical juggling 
the security of the region and israel should not depend on the 
media stunts of a terrorist like yasser arafat sofer said 
but french premier michel rocard who met wednesday with arafat 
said his comments constitute a positive clarification moving 
toward peace 
government spokesman louis le pensec briefing reporters on 
wednesdays regular cabinet meeting said mitterrand told his 
ministers he also noted that we are seeing a beginning of this 
clarification of the discrepancy between the plo charter and the 
november declaration 
also wednesday arafat went to pere lachaise cemetery in eastern 
paris to pay his respects to mahmoud el hamchari the plo 
representative in paris who died during a bomb explosion in his 
apartment in 1973 
el hamcharis widow and daughter stood beside arafat while he 
placed a wreath inscribed glory to the palestinian martyrs on 
the grave

the economy grew at a moderate sustainable 
pace in the past three months the federal reserve said wednesday 
in a report which analysts took as a sign that the central bank 
will not be pushing interest rates higher 
the feds review of economic conditions around the country 
painted a picture of an economy where the growth rate is slowing 
with inflationary pressures easing 
the central bank for the past year has been trying to engineer 
just such a development by pushing interest rates up to dampen 
demand and thus relieve pressures on tight labor markets and 
factories operating at peak capacity 
the tone of this report was more optimistic than the last 
economic survey released two months ago when the central bank 
expressed fears about pressures on wages and prices as a result of 
the pace of economic growth 
the new report based on surveys conducted by the 12 regional 
federal reserve banks said there were no serious bottlenecks in 
the manufacturing sector and the costs of raw materials and labor 
had shown no significant increases 
the nations economy grew at a moderate sustainable pace in 
february march and early april the central bank said in the new 
report 
by using the word sustainable analysts said the fed was 
expressing its satisfaction with the current pace of economic 
growth and indicating that it did not see the need to push interest 
rates higher 
this is a very optimistic review said david wyss an 
economist with data resources inc an economic consulting firm 
it says that the fed is happy with the way the economy has 
moderated with growth slowing to a sustainable level 
the economic survey will be used when fed policymakers meet on 
may 16 to decide on the course for future monetary strategy the 
feds main job is to keep inflation under control through decisions 
on how much money to make available to the banking system 
the fed has been in a holding pattern in recent months after a 
period of aggressively pushing interest rates higher in late 
december and january analysts said they believe interest rates 
will stay where they are currently for the next couple of months as 
the fed assesses the impact of its earlier actions 
but wyss said he expected rates to start falling by early summer 
as the slowdown in the economy becomes more pronounced 
while some economists have expressed fears that the fed has 
overdone its tightening efforts and will push the country into a 
recession later this year the economic review saw no evidence of a 
dangerous slowdown in any sector of the economy 
consumer spending manufacturing construction and agriculture 
were all reported to be performing adequately 
the commerce department reported last week that the nonfarm 
economy grew at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first three 
months of the year down slightly from a nonfarm growth rate of 
35 percent in the final three months of 1988 
many analysts believe economic growth will slow even further in 
coming quarters as the effect of the feds yearlong credit 
tightening works its way through the economy

a shortage of healthcare workers such as 
physical and occupational therapists is threatening the 
availability of hospital care an american hospital association 
survey said wednesday 
in its survey of 3001 hospitals the association found that 
despite adding overtime changing compensation programs setting up 
oncall staff pools and using contract services onefourth of the 
hospitals said they were forced to cut services 
of the hospitals that cut services more than 15 percent closed 
beds or units and almost 13 percent sent patients to other 
hospitals because they lacked sufficient staff 
hospital and patients already feel the effects of personnel 
shortages said association president carol mccarthy if left 
unchecked these shortages can threaten our ability to respond to 
the healthcare needs of all americans 
the survey found that of 20 personnel categories hospitals were 
having the most difficulty recruiting fulltime physical 
therapists clinical perfusionists operators of machines that 
support or temporarily replace circulatory or respiratory functions 
and occupational therapists 
also in short supply were speech pathologists and respiratory 
therapists pharmacists and certified registerednurse anesthetists 
positions for physical and occupational therapists have a 15 
percent to 16 percent vacancy rate 
to address the labor shortages ms mccarthy said she believed 
the industry must create preserve and expand educational 
opportunities for people interested in pursuing healthcare 
careers hospitals also must develop innovative staffing options 
that lead to greater staff productivity and retention she said 
the survey conducted from july through december 1988 found 
that vacancy rates varied according to regions but physical and 
occupational therapists are in short supply throughout the country

immigration authorities credited the mexican 
government wednesday with helping stem a flood of central american 
refugees illegally trying to cross the us border into texas 
james l buck deputy immigration commissioner said mexican 
authorities have arrested some 13000 central americans trying to 
enter mexico from the south in the past six months up from 12000 
in the previous year 
the latest arrests occurred after mexico tightened security 
along its own southern border and began random highway checks of 
motorists driving north through the country toward texas buck said 
mexicos steppedup enforcement combined with tighter border 
security imposed in february by us authorities in south texas 
has significantly reduced the flow of illegal aliens buck said 
an immigration and naturalization service task force set up feb 
21 to stem a flow of illegal aliens seeking political asylum has 
reported a sharp drop in border arrests since then buck said 
the task force arrested 54 people on tuesday down from the 200 
to 300 daily in february buck said 
the task force now gets only a handful of asylum applications 
each day buck said in february it was receiving as many as 200 a 
day following a court battle ins won the right to detain people 
seeking asylum while their applications were pending 
most of the applicants for asylum were rejected because us 
officials ruled they could not demonstrate a wellfounded fear of 
persecution at home ins officials say most are fleeing poverty and 
seeking better opportunities in this country and are therefore not 
political refugees 
as many as 2500 were detained at the ins facility in port 
isabel texas where 1500 people are currently being held about 
1700 have been deported 
the complement of 400 border patrol ins state department and 
immigration personnel who were sent to the harlingen texas area 
is costing the government 4 million to 5 million a month buck 
said 
if current trends continue probably by the end of the summer 
we will begin to see this entire task force sized down 
significantly buck said

longtime political and civil rights figure 
charles evers lost his bid for a fifth term as mayor of fayette in 
the democratic primary but evers says he wont miss being the 
center of attention 
im happy to be out of the race and out of the limelight 
the 66yearold evers said after losing tuesday 390248 to attorney 
and longtime foe kennie middleton 
it was time for a change added evers who says hell now 
concentrate on helping youth in fayette and jefferson county 
located in southwest mississippi and among the most impoverished 
areas of the nations poorest state 
middleton 39 a fayette native faces independent candidate 
william e smith in the june 6 general election 
the always outspoken and often controversial evers lost to 
middleton eight years ago and trailed in the balloting against 
middleton four years ago in 1985 however he won back the towns 
top spot for another fouryear term through legal challenges that 
eventually were settled by the mississippi supreme court evers 
first was elected mayor in 1969 
in 1985 he ran a very negative campaign and a campaign of lies 
that there were going to be quick solutions to the problems in 
fayette middleton said 
middleton said evers had done little over the years tobring 
about positive change in fayette a town of just over 2000 located 
about 25 miles northeast of the historic mississippi river city of 
natchez 
nearly 20 percent of fayette residents about 90 percent of whom 
are black were without jobs in march the last month for which 
figures are available mississippi had a march unemployment rate of 
86 percent and the national rate was 52 percent 
i think that for all of his visibility and name recognition 
theres one basic element missing middleton said those things 
do not make him a good administrator a good mayor he has 
celebrity status but that does not necessarily equate with the 
ability to run a city 
evers says while he was a candidate he didnt bother to 
campaign because he could feel the people wanted a change 
but i didnt want to quit i wanted the people to select 
change 
evers lost a 1978 us senate bid and ran unsuccessfully for 
governor in 1971 he was defeated in a march 14 special election 
for the states central district highway commissioner post 
evers is the brother of medgar evers who was field director of 
the state national association for the advancement of colored 
people when he was gunned down by a sniper in 1963 
he raised the ire of some civil rights leaders when on june 22 
1988 he gave a humanitarian award named for his brother to angolan 
rebel leader jonas savimbi 
im tired twenty years is enough evers said im tired 
of being out front let someone else be out front 
as for the future evers says he will continue living in fayette 
and will be supportive of the new adminstration 
i will continue to travel to promote to have fun and live 
he said i will keep busy

new experimental data support the suspicion that 
getting enough potassium in the diet may play a key part in keeping 
blood pressure under control 
the research suggests that when people do not get enough 
potassium in their diet their bodies fail to get rid of enough 
salt which makes their blood pressure go up 
epidemiological studies that look at large groups of people have 
found an association between low potassium intake and high blood 
pressure but experts were uncertain whether the potassium or some 
other nutritional deficiency was responsible 
in the latest study doctors compared the blood pressures of 10 
healthy people on very lowpotassium diets and on diets with normal 
amounts of the nutrient 
when these people ate diets low in potassium their blood 
pressures went up one of the main reasons seems to be related to 
sodium excretion when not eating enough potassium they could not 
get rid of enough sodium said dr g gopal krishna who directed 
the study at temple university in philadelphia 
krishna said more research will be needed before making new 
recommendations about what people should eat to hold down their 
blood pressures 
from this study i cant draw longterm implications he 
said but when you put two and two together with the 
epidemiological studies it suggests that low potassium intake 
might be one of the causes of hypertension 
the study was published in thursdays issue of the new england 
journal of medicine 
during 10 days on the lowsodium diets the volunteers blood 
pressures rose from a mean of 119 over 77 to 126 over 81 
most fruits and vegetables are good sources of potassium among 
some of the best are bananas starwberries potatoes and orange and 
grapefruit juice 
studies have shown that potassium consumption is especially low 
among blacks who are also at greater than usual risk of high blood 
pressure

terry rakolta the michigan woman who captured 
attention with a letterwriting campaign to advertisers on a 
network show she found offensive on wednesday announced a campaign 
to put more family programs on primetime television 
our emphasis will be to promote private voluntary efforts 
by the advertisers and the networks to raise the standards on 
network television mrs rakolta said of her new organization 
americans for responsible television 
she said the groups first goal would be the renewal of family 
viewing time which she described as at least two hours of nightly 
primetime entertainment suitable for children and adults 
i havent met anyone who said they want more sex or violence 
on tv mrs rakolta told a news conference the violence today 
is so good technically that youre almost a participant in it 
she said her fight against programs she views as inappropriate 
for children began last year when her 8yearold daughter became 
upset after watching an afternoon talk show that dealt with women 
who had sex with dogs but the straw that broke the camels 
back was a segment of fox televisions married with 
children 
she lobbied the advertisers with a letterwriting campaign to 
complain about sexual innuendo and the treatment of women in the 
popular comedy about a bluecollar family 
the advertisers later pulled their commercials from the show 
with procter amp gamble co mcdonalds corp tambrands inc and 
kimberly clark corp telling their advertising agencies not to buy 
time on the show 
in march two advertisers ralston purina co and general mills 
inc canceled plans to run commercials on nbcs saturday night 
live after complaints from the rev donald wildmons american 
family association of tupelo miss the christian group has 
campaigned for more than a decade against what wildmon sees as 
pornography and excessive violence in magazines on television and 
in the movies 
mrs rakolta told reporters that first amendment rights extend 
beyond simply turning off the television or turning the channel 
they include the right to voice our objections to the 
advertisers about the sex and violence being dumped into our homes 
every night 
she said she planned to mail letters to 5000 potential 
supporters for her group to ask that they ask advertisers not to 
sponsor shows the letter writers consider objectionable 
a boycott of products is always a tool its a tool of last 
resort mrs rakolta said networks and sponsors can work it 
out 
mrs rakolta said that when the set is on children are 
usually being exposed to programming that is inappropriate and 
potentially harmful 
the publicity around mrs rakoltas attacks against the fox show 
netted 832 letters most in sympathy to her bloomfield hills home 
she said she hoped to use those supporters as the base for her 
group

roger ailes the media master of the bush 
presidential campaign wants it known that he did not repeat not 
make any commercials featuring massachusetts convict willie 
horton 
at no time did any commercial for george bush contain a 
picture of willie horton or use his name ailes said in letters 
sent to news organizations including the associated press 
but wasnt it the bush campaign that made horton and the 
massachusetts prison furlough program an indelible part of voters 
perceptions of democrat michael dukakis 
indeed it was and the horton controversy lives on most 
recently in an article written for the washington post magazine by 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich and entitled willie 
horton and me 
the horton commercials were also at the center of successful 
efforts by students at predominantly black howard university to 
force former bush campaign manager lee atwater now republican 
national committee chairman to resign from the schools board of 
trustees 
ailes has been trying to walk away from horton for some time 
at first the bush campaign was concerned that the horton ads 
would create a political backlash among voters who perceived the 
ads as racist 
horton who is black escaped in 1986 while on his 10th furlough 
from a massachusetts prison where he was serving life without 
parole for a 1974 murder he surfaced in 1987 in maryland where he 
assaulted a couple and raped the woman 
more recently ailes is described by associates as tired of 
being identified incorrectly as the creator of the horton 
commercials 
the two commercials that featured horton were produced and aired 
by an independent expenditure committee called americans for bush 
not the official bush campaign committee 
as ailes pointed out in his letter federal law prohibits any 
collaboration between a political action committee and a legal 
campaign committee during the course of a campaign 
this is not to say that bush never raised the willie horton 
issue 
before those ads were aired bush recounted the horton case in 
great detail in his speech accepting the republican presidential 
nomination bush said it was a scandal to give a weekend furlough 
to a hardened firstdegree killer who hasnt even served enough 
time to be eligible for parole 
the bush campaign did run commercials criticizing the 
massachusetts prison furlough program but they never mentioned 
horton by name 
one was the crime quiz ad the announcer asked which 
candidate for president gave weekend passes to firstdegree 
murderers who are not even eligible for parole an unflattering 
picture of dukakis moved forward on the screen 
another bush commercial showed shadowy figures moving through a 
revolving gate while the announcer said his revolving door 
prison policy gave weekend furloughs to firstdegree murderers not 
eligible for parole while out many committed other crimes like 
kidnapping and rape and many are still at large 
jesse jackson and sen lloyd bentsen the democratic vice 
presidential nominee attacked the horton commercials as racist 
jackson said using the horton case is designed to create the most 
horrible psychosexual fears 
grossly unfair and untrue retorted bush when asked about 
the allegations his campaign was using racist tactics 
estrich wrote that while bush and his aides may not have paid 
for the television ads showing hortons picture and dukakis side by 
side americans for bush did they took great pride in having 
found and framed the issue 
late in the campaign ailes was interviewed on the cable news 
network and said that when he first saw the horton commercial i 
called headquarters and said whoevers doing that get them to stop 
it and the campaign legal counsel said we cant stop it we have 
had conversations weve sent letters we cant stop it 
jan baran who was general counsel to the bush campaign said he 
knew of no specific appeal to americans for bush to stop running 
the horton commercials 
bush aides did complain that the groups name and fundraising 
tactics gave the incorrect impression that it was an official arm 
of the campaign 
on sept 8 the day after the two horton commercials began a run 
on national cable networks that was slated to continue until oct 
5 elizabeth fediay head of americans for bush said she was 
sending a letter to campaign chairman james a baker iii asking him 
to express your wishes with regard to independent public advocacy 
of mr bush for president 
she said if he asks me to stop advocating the election of 
george bush i will 
in a letter dated sept 27 after the horton commercials had 
run for nearly three weeks baker wrote to ms fediay asking that 
you cease using his name the name americans for bush and any 
other name that suggests his or this campaigns association with 
you 
by then there were few voters left in america who werent 
familiar with the saga of willie horton

the navy believes it can repair the damaged 
gun turret on the battleship iowa for around 15 million to 20 
million with the lower figure more likely defense sources said 
wednesday 
the sources speaking one day after pentagon officials announced 
it was technically feasible to repair the turret after last months 
fatal explosion stressed the dollar estimate was preliminary and 
that no decision had been made to authorize the work 
an assessment team has provided the preliminary estimate but the 
investigation is continuing said one defense official who 
commented only on condition of anonymity 
the navy declined comment on the issue wednesday 
dan howard the defense departments chief spokesman said 
tuesday a 35member team of specialists had determined that 
materials and expertise were available to make repairs 
the answer to that basic question had not been clear in the 
immediate aftermath of the april 19 explosion because of the 
vessels age the iowa was commissioned in 1943 during world war ii 
and no vessel of its type has been built since that war 
fortyseven sailors died in the explosion inside the no 2 gun 
turret 
the fact that repairs are technically feasible does not mean the 
navy has decided to go ahead howard said but one defense official 
said a final repair estimate of 15 million would make it easier 
for the navy to make that decision 
some private naval experts because of the severity of the 
explosion had predicted last week repairs could cost as much as 
100 million the iowas skipper capt fred p moosally has said 
the vessel would be ready for battle even if the damaged turret was 
never repaired 
the huge battleship still has two other turrets each with three 
16inch guns

john turner who led a dramatic but unsuccessful 
fight against the free trade agreement with the united states 
announced wednesday he is stepping down as leader of the opposition 
liberal party 
the liberals lost twice to prime minister brian mulroneys 
progressive conservative party since turner took over the 
leadership in 1984 the most recent defeat was in november 1988 
it is my intention to resign as leader of the liberal party of 
canada at an appropriate time after the national executive has 
chosen a date for a leadership convention turner said in a 
letter released at an ottawa news conference 
i do feel regret that i was not able to accomplish the 
ultimate goal of a politician to win an election and become prime 
minister turner said 
turner 59 inherited the prime ministers job in 1984 after 
pierre trudeau resigned but turners term lasted only 79 days he 
and the liberals were ousted by brian mulroney and the 
conservatives in an election that left barely 40 liberals in the 
commons 
much of his era as liberal leader was marked by fierce internal 
battles within the party which dominated canadian politics for 
much of the 20th century 
turner a lawyer revived his own and his partys sagging 
fortunes with a persistent emotional campaign against the free 
trade agreement that mulroney signed with former president reagan 
in january 1988 
the agreement will eliminate trade barriers between the united 
states and canada over a 10year period 
this is the fight of my life ive never been more serious 
about any cause in my life he said of his effort to halt the 
agreement during the fall election campaign 
the high point of the campaign came during a televised debate 
with mulroney and ed broadbent of the thirdplace new democratic 
party in which turner accused the prime minister of placing 
canadas sovereignty at risk by signing the agreement 
you sold us out turner said almost instantly soaring in 
the opinion polls and attracting fervent crowds to his once nearly 
deserted rallies 
but mulroney went on to win a second consecutive majority 
government clinching the way for the pact to take effect jan 1 
turner gained credit for doubling the partys seats to 83 in the 
295seat house of commons 
the new democrats also are in a leadership race after broadbent 
announced in march his retirement after 14 years at the socialist 
partys helm 
mulroney speaking to reporters in boston during a threeday 
visit to the united states called turner a very worthy 
opponent who gave as good as he got 
turner said he expected to remain a member of parliament for 
the immediate future he said he had no job lined up in the 
private sector 
a liberal party convention is set for october in calgary but 
the party executive can decide to defer a leadership convention and 
turn the gathering into a policy conference

southern sudanese rebels have kidnapped a 
roman catholic priest from france and are holding him in the 
wartorn south or neighboring uganda a french diplomat said 
wednesday 
french embassy spokesman jeanluc eyguiser identified the priest 
only as the rev le vacher and said he was kidnapped from torit a 
southern sudanese town that fell feb 26 to rebels of the sudan 
peoples liberation army 
eyguiser refused to say when it is thought the priest was 
abducted 
in paris a spokesman for the white fathers confirmed that a 
rev jeanmarie le vacher 62 has been assigned to torit since may 
1987 but the rev louis nouaille said the order has not heard of 
any kidnapping 
he said he last heard of le vacher on march 17 when a colleague 
returning from torit told him the priest was in good health 
had there been any question of a kidnapping at the time we 
would have known he said in a telephone interview 
nouaille did not dismiss the possibility le vacher was kidnapped 
later 
he said the priest born in the mediterranean town of giens 
insisted on staying on in torit despite the fighting 
rebels in southern sudan took up arms against the government in 
1983 demanding autonomy and more economic development from the 
khartoum government which is dominated by the majority moslems 
most southerners are a minority of christians and animists 
rebels have kidnapped more than 20 foreign missionaries and 
development workers over the years 
in 1983 sudanese commandos twice stormed rebel camps to free 
foreign hostages some held under death threats against demands for 
money 
kidnappings since then appear to be publicity ploys though 
rebels claim they abduct victims for their own protection those 
held are freed after varying lengths of time 
this week rebel leader john garang announced a onemonth 
ceasefire to allow the government to work on a peace plan and to 
facilitate a massive un relief effort to save 100000 southerners 
threatened by warinduced famine

a grand jury heard testimony wednesday from 
relatives of a man accused of murdering his 16monthold son 
comatose since last summer by unhooking his hospital lifesupport 
system 
the wife mother and brother of rudy linares 23 of suburban 
cicero testified behind closed doors before the panel which can 
decide if linares should be indicted in the death of his son 
samuel who was buried monday 
linares held hands with his wife tamara as they and other 
relatives entered the cook county criminal court building 
theyre in deep grieving over this said kevin smith an 
assistant public defender representing linares 
this has been a ninemonth ordeal for them and its been 
exacerbated by the fact that their grieving has been done in 
public rudy and tammy cant just go off by themselves and 
grieve smith said 
the boy suffered brain damage after choking on a balloon or 
small piece of aluminum foil last summer officials have said 
authorities said linares held rushpresbyterianst lukes 
medical center workers at bay with a gun early on april 26 and 
unhooked the ventilator that kept samuel alive for eight months 
according to police linares tearfully held samuel until he died 
saying later he did it because i loved my son 
linares charged with firstdegree murder was not subpoenaed to 
appear before the grand jury he waited in his attorneys office 
while mrs linares his brother robert and his mother marie 
linares went to testify his lawyers said 
the family members all left the building later wednesday without 
talking to reporters 
we encourage rudys wife mother and brother to fully 
cooperate in the sure belief that the grand jury will refuse to 
indict smith said 
if the grand jury chooses not to return an indictment the case 
would likely go to a criminal court judge whose options would 
include dropping the existing charge 
tamara linares accompanied by her lawyer daniel coyne was in 
the grand jury room for about 25 minutes 
coyne said later that she did not invoke a 5th amendment right 
to avoid testifying but he would not disclose what she said im 
convinced shes not a target of the investigation he added 
the couple have two other children a boy and a girl under age 5

the town of rantoul ill is the first to 
receive a federal planning grant from the pentagon to help cope 
with the upcoming round of military base closings the defense 
department said wednesday 
the community located next to the chanute air force base will 
receive 73045 to help organize a base reuse committee to start 
planning the civilian conversion of the base property according 
to a pentagon statement 
in addition to the federal money rantoul is contributing money 
and services worth 11300 and the state of illinois 10000 to 
support the effort 
the reuse committee will oversee development of a balanced 
plan for the property covering such uses as aviation industrial 
development housing education recreation and possibly 
healthrelated activities the pentagon statement said 
the grant was made by the pentagons office of economic 
adjustment which has helped more than 400 communities since 1961 
deal with the closure of nearby military facilities 
the grant to rantoul however is the first since congress 
approved a long list of base closings last month under a special 
procedure set up last year chanute air force base is one of 86 
bases now set for closure under the program which was prompted 
primarily by budget concerns 
savings from the plan which also includes substantial changes 
at 54 other facilities are estimated at 694 million a year at 
first savings over 20 years are estimated at 56 billion 
the pentagon has estimated that 15 to 20 communities will apply 
for grants similar to that given rantoul besides planning grants 
the pentagon office also is authorized to help with the 
construction or hardware costs of converting bases to other uses 
the department has asked congress for 2 million in fiscal 1990 
for economic adjustment work

with hundreds of mcdonalds big macs 
stored in its bomb bay a p3 orion submarine hunter will lift off 
may 11 on a mission to the portuguese azores perhaps one of the 
few places left on earth where there are no golden arches 
the airborne food run was the brainchild of azores troop 1 of 
the worldwide direct service council of the boy scouts which 
decided that peddling a bit of fast food would be a good way to 
raise money for a jamboree in west germany 
the flight from brunswick naval air station to the island 3000 
miles into the atlantic will be a routine navy logistics flight it 
would take place with or without the 2000 big macs which have 
been ordered in advance from a local mcdonalds restaurant 
the military said the burgers will go into an unpressurized bomb 
bay where they will stay frozen during the flight the other big 
mac ingredients will be packed in special containers and stored in 
the planes cabin 
once the burgers are on the ground they will be cooked by 21 
scouts who point out that some of the folks on the island will 
probably buy them up fast after going up to three years with no 
mcdonalds food

senators said wednesday that if west germany 
pushes for removing shortrange nuclear missiles from its soil the 
united states might reconsider its commitment to having many troops 
stationed in europe 
members of the senate armed services committee told defense 
secretary dick cheney they had serious concerns about west german 
positions favoring a delay in modernization of the weapons and 
urging ussoviet negotiations to scale back the shortrange 
rockets 
the west german stand and the bush administrations support for 
tripling the range of the usbuilt lance missiles has created a 
major dispute within the 16member nato alliance 
i think if the west german people have come to the conclusion 
they can place more faith and reliance on soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachevs words and assurances than they can upon sound nato 
strategy then it would be very difficult for me to continue to 
commit the size of the forces we have in europe under those 
circumstances said sen william cohen rmaine 
sen slade gorton rwash said that if the missiles are 
eliminated and the 324000 us forces are put at risk the 
administrations policy should be that a substantial percentage 
of troops be brought home and we allow west germany greater 
responsibility of their defense 
cheney on capitol hill to discuss the fiscal 1990 defense 
budget cautioned against overdramatizing the nature of the 
current differences within nato 
but cheney speculated that if a consensus called for a zero 
level for the shortrange missiles i as secretary of defense 
would have something of a stomach ache if we found ourself in the 
position where in fact large numbers of our nato allies encouraged 
us to maintain our conventional forces in europe but take out all 
our nuclear weapons in europe 
the defense secretary said president bush has not considered 
that possibility but if it did occur there would be a major 
dustup in the alliance 
west germany wants the united states to negotiate with the 
soviet union on reductions in the shortrange missiles the united 
states and britain have rejected such negotiations 
alliance members are hoping to reach some internal consensus 
prior to the nato summit meeting in brussels may 2930 
sen sam nunn dga the committee chairman expressed concerns 
that nato appears to be shooting itself in the foot 
everyday by focusing on such a narrow issue and faulted both 
sides in the dispute for failing to show any vision 
i dont see any strategy on the part of the german government 
where theyre basically saying they wont modernize but they want 
to negotiate nunn told cheney i dont see much strategy 
coming out of the other sides position which says we insist on 
modernizing and building a weapon that you will not accept but we 
wont negotiate even if the soviets make tremendous unequal 
positions 
nunn said the nato alliance is letting slip an opportunity to 
negotiate reductions in conventional forces the chairman suggested 
a threetrack approach linking modernization of the shortrange 
missile reductions of the weapons and cuts in conventional 
strength 
cheney said the debate within the nato alliance is a very 
difficult and delicate area although he termed the west german 
position a weak one because it focuses solely on negotiation 
during his appearance before the panel cheney also played down 
the apparent disparity between his pessimistic assessment of 
gorbachevs chances of implementing reforms and the view held by 
bush 
the president and i were in a meeting yesterday and frankly 
chuckled at what has developed by way of press commentary on views 
that we have expressed we do not perceive a significant difference 
in terms of our views of the situation with respect to the soviet 
union cheney said 
the defense secretary created a stir last week by speculating 
gorbachev may fail to institute reforms and could be replaced by a 
hardliner 
bush secretary of state james a baker iii and white house 
chief of staff john sununu offered more hopeful assessments of 
gorbachevs liberalization efforts although they did not publicly 
rebuke cheney 
cheney said wednesday that he responded previously the other 
day perhaps with more candor than was warranted about my view 
somewhat pessimistic concerning mr gorbachevs prospect for 
achieving his reforms 
the president has expressed the hope those reforms will be 
successful we dont see those as contradictory statements 
cheney said 
on other matters cheney 
said a pentagon review panel would determine if testing of 
brilliant pebbles a more advanced star wars system consisting 
of thousands of orbiting satellites would violate the broad 
interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty im 
certainly not about to embark on an activity breaching that 
treaty cheney said 
defended his decision to eliminate the v22 osprey despite 
complaints from sen john glenn dohio that 2 billion and nine 
years of work have been invested in the shiptoshore aircraft 
cheney said if congress found some way to put money back in the 
budget he would not object to bringing the program back

a private human rights group said wednesday 
that conditions for next sundays elections in panama fall far 
short of minimum standards for a fair process while the us 
government continued its campaign of daily attacks as well 
the state department accused panamanian authorities of adopting 
an increasingly threatening tone as the election approaches 
a report issued by the international human rights law group 
based in washington said the panamanian government has taken a 
number of steps to prevent an honest election including the 
forcing of prominent opposition leaders into exile 
it also said that panamas electoral tribunal is dominated by 
progovernment representatives whose response to opposition 
complaints has failed to inspire confidence in its impartiality 
the report said that the panamanian government has demonstrated 
both before and during the election campaign a willingness to 
disregard the individual rights of its citizens 
it noted that other human rights groups have alleged cases of 
prolonged detention without charge of torture and even of murder 
of goverment critics 
all of the evidence gathered by the law group in its study of 
this election points unequivocally to the conclusion that the 
conditions for the election fall far short of the minimum standards 
required for a free and fair electoral exercise the report said 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the 
panama defense forces and the government news media are undertaking 
a campaign of intimidation aimed at reducing voter turnout and 
discouraging popular protest once the victory of the governments 
candidate carlos duque is announced 
she noted that the government has warned that any media 
reporting results other than those released by the government will 
be punished by warnings fines and possibly closure

the house ethics committee wednesday began 
interviewing a group of texans involved in a gasdrilling venture 
that has so far produced little gas but resulted in large profits 
to house speaker jim wright 
the panel began two days of scheduled interviews by going behind 
closed doors to question san antonio businessman morris jaffe 
jaffe and his son doug who are friends of wright allowed the 
speaker and his business partner george mallick to buy into the 
well venture last year 
at the same time a special house ethics task force created this 
year to examine house rules and ethics guidelines opened public 
hearings on such areas as financial disclosure outside income 
receipt of gifts and use of official resources 
task force chairman vic fazio dcalif also a member of the 
ethics committee said the panel hoped to learn from lawmakers 
ethics problems to draft clarifications in the rules and achieve 
better education of house members and staff 
while fazio sought to isolate the hearing from the current 
atmosphere of the wright case former rep otis pike dny hit 
it head on 
your preoccupation with each others ethics is preventing you 
from doing your jobs pike testified it is taking too much of 
your time and worse it is creating an atmosphere and an 
institution in which suspicion bitterness personal dislikes and 
private vendettas make cooperative efforts in writing laws 
increasingly difficult and that is serious 
he added no one learns his ethics in congress no one needs 
to be told by his colleagues what is right and fair and 
honorable ethics is not as great a problem with congress as is 
courage 
ethics committee chairman julian dixon dcalif said the 
session with jaffe had been productive but would not comment on 
the businessmans testimony jaffes lawyer stanley brand said 
the questions generally covered the same ground as a 23page report 
on the gas deal which he issued earlier in the week 
that report justified the transaction as a legitimate business 
venture and noted that the remaining partners in the deal plan to 
drill another well believing substantial gas deposits remain to be 
tapped it was not the report contended a gift to wright designed 
to gain favor and influence over legislation 
the jaffes have been competing to sell the air force a new 
trainer aircraft produced by one of their companies 
the wrightmallick partnerships 9120 investment last year 
grew into a 340000 profit over a period of five months even 
though the well had been unable to produce commercial quantities of 
gas 
when it announced last week it was charging wright with 69 house 
rules violations the ethics committee said it was continuing to 
investigate the gas venture known as the sabine lake project after 
its location near the louisianatexas line 
also to be interviewed by the committee were doug jaffe doug 
prestridge a geologist dave myers who provided the drilling 
equipment for the sabine lake well and marlyn cherry the jaffes 
bookkeeper 
the continuing investigation has stalled committee progress 
toward holding a disciplinary hearing for wright the triallike 
phase of the ethics process in which evidence is presented and 
wright will have a chance to make a personal appeal 
wright seemed to complain about the slowness on tuesday calling 
the investigation a moving target which was frustrating his 
efforts to mount a defense 
but dixon dismissed that charge saying the committee is abiding 
strictly by its rules he will in an appropriate time have a 
chance to respond to all the charges dixon said

witnesses urged congress on wednesday to lift 
restrictions that allow the government to keep foreigners out of 
the united states because of their ideological beliefs 
under the mccarranwalter immigration law foreigners may be 
kept out for ideological reasons other laws allow the federal 
government to restrict foreign travel by americans through limits 
on the way the dollar can be spent 
novelist larry mcmurtry told the house judiciary committees 
subcommittee on courts intellectual property and the 
administration of justice that if the mccarranwalter act 
abridges the rights of americans to engage in facetoface 
discussions and debate with foreign colleagues 
choichiro yatani a japanese who teaches psychology in the state 
university of new york at stony brook said he was jailed for 44 
days and threatened with deportation over suspicions he was a 
communist he said his status in the country remains tenuous and 
my name remains on the immigration lookout list 
a bill by rep barney frank dmass would allow foreigners to 
visit the united states regardless of their ideas or what they 
might say here 
the justice department has told frank in a letter that it wants 
to keep the authority to prevent the entry of foreigners it 
considers undesirable 
rep howard berman dcalif has introduced a bill to end the 
currency restrictions that have been used to limit travel by 
americans he noted that as americans do not spend their own money 
they are free to travel to cuba 
this means that americans can and do travel to cuba as guests 
of a cuban government eager to present a positive image of life in 
cuba i find it highly compromising for americans to be able to 
travel to cuba only on castros tab berman said 
loren f ghiglione president of the american society of 
newspaper editors criticized vice president dan quayle and 
secretary of state james a baker iii for the administrations 
refusal to admit cubas fidel castro and nicaraguas daniel ortega 
to address the societys meeting last month 
quayle had suggested that ortega could have been interviewed in 
nicaragua 
if i as the editor of a 7000 circulation newspaper may be 
permitted a somewhat personal response to the vice presidents 
suggestion i would remind the committee that the us press is 
unlike that of any other nations ghiglione said in prepared 
testimony 
it is essentially localprovincial not national half the 
countrys dailies have a circulation of 20000 or less while i and 
other smalltown editors have made reporting trips to nicaragua 
the middle east southern africa and other newsworthy parts of the 
world we do not have the resources or clout to travel to nicaragua 
and interview mr ortega on a regular basis 
ghiglione said americans are hindered in criticizing censorship 
elsewhere by what he called oppressive and restrictive censorial 
authority within the united states 
baker in defending the decision to keep castro and ortega from 
speaking to the asne meeting said he did not believe the decision 
amounted to censorship he said the government was exercising a 
certain amount of discretion in not issuing visas for the two 
marxist leaders

israels army on wednesday unveiled a 
new tank that the inventor says will remain forever young 
because of a unique armor system that can be replaced even on the 
battlefield 
army commanders said the thickskinned merkava mark 3 can 
survive anything an enemy infantryman can throw at it making the 
tank one of the toughest in the world merkava means chariot in 
hebrew 
this is the most protected tank against known antitank 
weaponry brig gen yossi ben hanan head of the armored corps 
told reporters during a visit to the production line at a military 
base near tel aviv 
the mark 3 is a step ahead of any tank deployed in the middle 
east now he said adding it was on a par with the new soviet 
t80 and the us m1a1 
israel tal a retired major generalwho developed the tank and is 
now a defense ministry adviser said the revolutionary change in 
the tank was the construction of modular units and bolton armor 
that can be removed to make way for improvements 
this means the tank can get periodic facelifts to keep its skin 
as tough as possible this is especially important at a time when 
armor technology is rapidly changing he said 
this tank will remain forever young it will never be old the 
armor can be changed at any time even in the field said tal 
who led the armored column that seized the suez canal from egypt in 
the 1967 middle east war 
in addition to the replaceable armor some parts of the vehicle 
such as the fireproof fuel tanks in the rear are modular units that 
can be changed if upgraded parts are developed 
the army screened a film of the lowslung tank tearing across 
the rocky terrain of northern israel making about a 40foot leap 
through the air from an earthen embankment while going full tilt 
the mark 3s top speed was not disclosed but it has a usmade 
1200 horsepower engine it also has a larger gun 120mm instead of 
the 105mm cannon on earlier models 
in chemical nuclear or biological warfare the tank can be 
sealed shut and the crew can operate in an airconditioned 
environment without gas masks or cumbersome suits tal said the 
atmosphere in the cabin is overpressured so that air leaks out 
rather than poison seeping inside he said 
other unique features of the merkava include a back door that 
allows the tank to unload an infantry squad during a battle and a 
frontmounted engine which doubles as additional armor to protect 
the crew 
the new tank costs 23 million per unit to develop compared to 
18 million for the mark 1 first introduced in 1979 and 
battletested against syrias sovietmade t62 tanks in the 1982 
lebanon war 
tal said the advent of the mark 3 means israel now is in a 
position to sell its mark 1 and 2 tanks to foreign countries he 
also said special features of the tank such as the bolton armor 
could be sold separately to uprgrade existing tanks and other 
armored vehicles 
despite some contentions that tanks are no longer the dominant 
force in land battles tal contends they will remain a key element 
of warfare 
tanks are considered by both east and west as the backbone of 
warfare on land this didnt change yet and the assumption is that 
it wont change until the end of the century he said

the treasury department announced wednesday 
that it plans to borrow 2875 billion next week to replenish the 
governments coffers in one of four giant debt auctions it holds 
during the year 
treasury officials said the auctions would include the sale of 
threeyear and 10year notes and 30year bonds to refinance 173 
billion in maturing government debt and raise 115 billion in new 
cash 
the total debt being sold was in line with market expectations 
and was very similar to the last debt sale held in february 
at a briefing for reporters william bremner treasury deputy 
assistant secretary for finance said that the department expected 
the governments debt which currently stands at 276 trillion 
would hit the congressional limit of 28 billion sometime this 
summer 
we will hit the debt ceiling some time this summer and when it 
occurs it is our hope that congress will raise the debt ceiling in 
a timely fashion bremner said 
in the past extended debate over raising the limit on how much 
the government can borrow has often become embroiled in questions 
about spending and taxes and has thrown government operations into 
a turmoil with threatened shutdowns because of a lack of cash 
however administration officials said they hope the recent 
budget accord reached with congress will avoid that situation this 
year 
according to wednesdays announcement the auctions for next 
week will include 
975 billion in threeyear notes in minimum denominations of 
5000 to be auctioned on tuesday 
95 billion in 10year notes in minimum denominations of 
1000 to be auctioned on wednesday 
95 billion in 30year bonds in minimum denominations of 
1000 to be auctioned on thursday

the chairman of a house subcommittee 
criticized the environmental protection agency wednesday for not 
doing more to stop pesticides banned in this country from showing 
up in imported food 
the government must ensure that foreign buyers of usmade 
pesticides understand their dangers and protect the american public 
from imported food contaminated with unsafe pesticides said rep 
mike synar dokla 
the epa has failed miserably said synar chairman of the 
house government operations committees subcommittee on 
environment energy and natural resources which has jurisdiction 
over the agency 
during a hearing of his subcommittee synar said agriculture 
department inspectors found chlordane a chemical believed to cause 
cancer in two shipments of honduran beef 
our reports show that chlordane is made only in the united 
states but is not allowed to be sold here as pesticide said 
synar 
in both cases most of the honduran beef had been sold to 
grocery stores ground up and purchased by consumers before the 
chlordane contamination was discovered 
synar criticized the epa for not warning the agriculture 
department that honduras was buying an americanmade pesticide that 
could contaminate beef sold to the united states 
its time for congress to revisit our pesticide export 
policies he said 
during the hearing epa officials admitted they cant ensure 
that pesticides outlawed here wont show up in imported food but 
they also charged that the subcommittee hasnt followed its own 
suggestions for helping other countries better understand the 
dangers of some pesticides made in the us 
linda fisher epa assistant administrator for policy planning 
and evaluation said the agency was aware more needed to be done 
when presented with an internal memo dated april 17 1987 that 
outlined improvements needed to better educate foreign buyers and 
protect american consumers she conceded that none had been 
followed 
but fisher assured synar the epa would quickly act on the 
recommendations as well as those of international negotiators 
working to establish a policy for worldwide pesticide use 
synars charges against the epa were supported by a report from 
the general accounting office an investigative arm of congress 
the gao said epa has no established procedures for deciding when 
to notify foreign countries about pesticides the united states has 
designated dangerous to human health 
the epa also has no standards for determining whether action 
taken against pesticides in this country are significant enough to 
warn another nation according to the gao report 
under us law pesticides that are banned or unregistered 
domestically can be sold abroad if the foreign buyer provides a 
statement saying he understands that the product is outlawed in the 
united states a copy of that statement is provided to the foreign 
government through the state department 
the epa does not routinely send out notices to foreign 
governments when companies voluntarily cancel domestic 
registrations the gao said 
the agency is considering improvements to its present 
procedures including those reocmmended by gao said fisher

chancellor helmut kohl had his first 
meeting late wednesday with the new toughtalking us ambassador 
after the netherlands and canada pushed for compromise in a nato 
dispute over defense strategy 
ambassador vernon a walters repeatedly has stated his support 
for a nato project that would more than triple the range of nuclear 
missiles based in west germany and his opposition to arms talks 
with the kremlin aimed at reducing shortrange missile stockpiles 
but embassy spokesman bill bach said walters who started his 
job last week would make no public comment on his talks with west 
german leaders in alliance efforts to resolve the issue 
government spokesman reinhardt schwarzer said kohls office also 
would not comment officially 
in washington president bush on thursday ruled out negotiations 
with moscow on shortrange nuclear missiles and the white house 
portrayed bushs disagreement with kohl as a sign of natos 
vitality 
kohl stirred the longsimmering dispute over shortrange nuclear 
forces which arms negotiators call snf into a fullfledged 
controversy last week when he called for negotiations aimed at 
the third zero or ultimate elimination of shortrange missiles 
talks are already in progress to cut the superpower arsenals of 
longrange missiles and the december 1987 agreement on 
intermediaterange forces set out the total removal of those 
weapons to reach the first zero 
the pentagon opposes negotiations on shortrange missiles 
claiming the warsaw pact has a predominance in conventional arms 
and that until a balance is achieved the western alliance needs to 
retain a nuclear option 
but west german fears of becoming a nuclear battleground 
intensified in recent months because most of the shortrange 
missiles the only nuclear weapons not under negotiation are 
based in west germany 
of natos 88 lance missile launchers deployed in central europe 
76 are in west germany the rockets have a range of about 75 miles 
so their use would mean fighting a nuclear war on west german 
territory 
the snf flareup triggered a flurry of diplomatic efforts to work 
out a compromise that would satisfy all 16 member nations of the 
north atlantic treaty organization 
us officials here and in washington and brussels say they 
presented ideas to resolve the impasse but no visible signs 
emerged that the dispute would soon be put to rest 
canada said wednesday it had communicated a compromise plan to 
bonn washington and london but external affairs spokesman 
christian sarrazin said no details would be disclosed 
a senior bonn official told the associated press the canadian 
proposal was under review by the foreign ministry but said he 
could not comment further 
government spokesman hans klein was asked at a news conference 
if kohl would insist on opening shortrange talks before west 
germanys next federal elections in december 1990 or if timing of 
the forum was a possible area of compromise 
a lot of things are possible klein replied vaguely 
a senior us official who briefed reporters in bonn on 
condition of anonymity expressed confidence the snf debate would 
be ironed out by the end of the month when leaders of nato nations 
meet in brussels for their annual summit 
dutch premier ruud lubbers talked with kohl earlier wednesday on 
ways of breaking the impasse but officials refused to discuss 
details 
on tuesday foreign minister hansdietrich genscher met with 
french foreign minister roland dumas and kohl went to rome as part 
of an apparent campaign to gain support for bonns position 
bonn says norway denmark belgium italy greece and spain 
support it on shortrange talks and resistance to natos replacing 
the lance systems with new missiles capable of reaching targets 300 
miles away 
but italian premier ciriaco de mita said his country favors 
linking the snf forum to progress toward a balance of conventional 
arms between east and west a condition also stipulated by the 
united states and britain

stiff prison sentences are fine the 
administrations top drugcontrol official said wednesday but in 
drug cases certainty of punishment is more important than 
severity 
william j bennett director of the office of national drug 
control policy told several hundred members of the washington 
metropolitan area interreligious coalition that his approach to the 
drug problem can be summed up in the words consequences and 
confrontation 
those who use sell and traffic in drugs must be confronted 
and they must suffer consequences bennett said he is working on 
a strategy for drug control nationwide with a report due in early 
september 
while saying there is broad agreement on such consequences as 
seizure of assets stiffer prison sentences revocation of bail 
rights and the death penalty for drug kingpins he added i 
also find that we lack the resources to assure that consequences 
always follow crime 
he called for more prisons and jails and for more investigators 
prosecutors and judges but also said more and tougher action 
will not be enough 
i think we need to reorient our process of justice where drugs 
are concerned and adopt the principle that certainty of punishment 
is more important than severity of punishment bennett said 
those guilty of drug offenses must believe that punishment is 
inevitable as long as they dont the deterrent effect of 
incarceration is neutralized 
after the speech bennett said he wasnt suggesting reduced 
sentences for drug offenders including what he termed casual users 
i am for severe penalties particularly when a drug crime is 
severe but what you have to have is certain punishment he said 
you shouldnt make certain punishment hostage to severe 
punishment 
what that means is a person that commits a drug crime has to 
know theyre going to be punished and if you have to sacrifice an 
extra six months of punishment in order to be sure the person gets 
some punishment make sure they get some punishment bennett 
said it would be better in many situations to have everyone 
thats convicted of drug use to go to jail for a week than to 
just get a third of them going for six months 
as an example he cited a practice in phoenix where he said 
police arrested drug users many of them middleclass and put 
them in jail for a weekend thats all just a weekend for a lot 
of middleclass users that is plenty of time they are cured 
after one weekend in the slammer 
bennett acknowledged that such an idea would be for state and 
local governments to carry out and that he as director of national 
drug control policy would not be imposing such regulations on the 
federal level 
but he said local officials have asked him repeatedly during his 
two months on the job to let them know if there are any good ideas 
floating around and the phoenix example is one hes advocating 
another local example he touted was that of toledo ohio where 
parents are brought before the juvenile justice court and made to 
answer for the actions of their children through civil penalties 
this policy establishes the principle that parents must 
bear responsibility for the behavior and the activities of minors 
in their charge bennett said minors who are nonaddicted 
users must be taught early on that they cannot behave with 
impunity and parents who have effectively turned them loose must 
learn why the social contract demands that they oversee and control 
the impulses of their children 
asked later if that included jailing parents for their 
childrens transgressions bennett said that should occur only in 
extreme cases 
as for treatment and rehabilitation of drug offenders bennett 
told the coalition that in many cases rehabilitation is the 
wrong term to use 
in the case of 15yearold offenders who have grown up 
essentially without parents some therapists i have talked to have 
found it necessary to serve as substitute parents complete with a 
tuckin and bedtime story at night he said

congress was asked wednesday to set up a 60 
million soybean research and promotion program financed by a levy 
on domestic soybean production 
proposed legislation developed by the american soybean 
association would provide for a nationwide checkoff similar to 
programs involving other commodities including those for dairy 
pork and beef producers 
money from a mandatory assessment would pay for farmerrun 
programs to expand exports develop new uses for soybeans and 
promote soybean products through a national advertising campaign 
the program would be administered by state and national boards 
composed of soybean producers 
this program is and will be farmerbred farmerfed and 
farmerled said james lee adams of camilla ga president of 
the american soybean association 
at a news conference sen david pryor dark said the 
legislation would give american soybean farmers a war chest of 
their own to combat promotional and research efforts of foreign 
competitors 
currently 26 states have soybean promotion programs generating 
a total of about 15 million and the national levy would replace 
those 
the proposed rate of assessment would be onehalf percent of the 
net market value of soybeans sold by a farmer 50 cents for every 
100 in sales half of the estimated 60 million in collections 
would go to state programs 
if the legislation is enacted the assessment would be 
implemented and a producer referendum would be held 18 to 36 months 
later to determine whether it should continue

peace talks involving three of 
cambodias four factions ended wednesday with glowing reports of 
progress and plans for more negotiations 
we have made tremendous progress we achieved concrete 
results said prince norodom sihanouk former ruler of cambodia 
and leader of the threeparty resistance coalition 
i symbolize cambodia he said all four factions want the 
prince to return as head of state 
the khmer rouge which has the strongest army in the coalition 
did not attend the jakarta meeting the third in 10 months 
vietnams invasion of cambodia in december 1979 deposed the khmer 
rouge which killed hundreds of thousands of people during its 
reign from 1975 the three other factions oppose its return to 
power 
hun sen premier of the vietnamsponsored government in phnom 
penh spoke on wednesday of quite big progress and the promise 
of more to come 
a khmer rouge radio broadcast said it rejected conciliatory 
moves by hun sens government as merely an effort to legitimize 
itself 
sihanouk said the khmer rouge will reject everything because 
they are interested in the continuation of the war he quoted hun 
sen as saying let the khmer rouge stay in the jungle 
even the more sober assessment of former premier son sann 
leader of the third guerrilla group acknowledged points of 
agreement at the jakarta meeting he issued a statement saying a 
compromise was expected to resolve the external aspect of the 
conflict that began with the invasion 
vietnam has pledged to withdraw all its military forces from 
cambodia by sept 30 
sihanouk said he would decide whether to return as head of state 
after complete withdrawal of vietnamese forces was confirmed and 
the constitution was amended to guarantee a multiparty political 
system 
i think my demands will be met he said 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and ali alatas 
foreign minister of indonesia have been asked to devise an 
international control plan and prepare a conference to consider it 
son sann said the conference is scheduled for july 2425 in paris 
son sann told reporters participants in the conference should 
include the five permanent members of the un security council 
japan australia the four factions laos vietnam and members of 
the association of southeast asian nations the philippines 
thailand malaysia indonesia singapore and brunei 
the five permanent security council members are the united 
states soviet union china britain and france 
an international control plan is intended to keep the peace 
between the vietnamese withdrawal and elections it probably will 
include representatives of two western nations two communist 
countries and two from the group professing nonalignment 
sihanouk and son sann who lead noncommunist resistance groups 
had demanded a un peacekeeping force but agreed to compromise 
in return hun sen had his national assembly change the 
countrys name from peoples republic of kampuchea to the state of 
cambodia and promised several constitutional and other changes 
son sann and sihanouk were not content with the changes 
however and son sanns statement said we agree to disagree on 
the internal aspect 
he accused hun sen of wanting to take the two noncommunist 
factions into his party and freeze out the communist khmer rouge in 
hopes of getting the recognition at the conference that has been 
withheld by the united nations the resistance coalition holds 
cambodias seat in the un general assembly 
the guerrilla factions want a fourparty coalition during the 
interim from vietnamese withdrawal to elections

one shot into the net produced a particular grimace from the 
president and an expletive between clenched teeth sorry he 
said quickly 
when a reporter complimented the president on his game bush 
replied answer to this game is to get a good partner 
but bushs serve failed him in the first set he double faulted 
to lose the game point with that the small group of reporters and

with final exams just two weeks away a 
union of 3200 graduate assistants walked out of university of 
californiaberkeley classrooms wednesday and onto picket lines to 
press a demand for recognition as employees 
hey hey ho ho union bustings got to go signcarrying 
teaching and research assistants chanted as they demonstrated at 
every major entrance to the campus 
their union based here the association for graduate student 
employees is affiliated with the united auto workers and is the 
vanguard of a burgeoning movement challenging the traditional view 
of graduate students as scholars living off stipends the students 
say they are underpaid overworked and often forced to go without 
health and other benefits 
this is not a question of mainly getting more money for me 
its a matter of justice said james martel a 24yearold 
teaching assistant in the political science department 
were not a bunch of berkeley radicals demanding a change in 
foreign policy we just want to exercise a basic american right to 
join a union and have our concerns represented at a bargaining 
table added martel who joined about 200 pickets as classes were 
to begin 
union representatives claimed hundreds of classes were canceled 
on the first day of the twoday strike the university did not 
check the number of canceled classes but a berkeley spokesman 
called the protest largely symbolic 
about 90 percent ot the 3200 graduate assistants took part in 
the walkout the association claimed there are about 9000 
graduate students at berkeley 
a victory by the berkeley students could legitimize similar 
demands eat many more campuses said david lambert a member of the 
associations executive board 
the movement nationally on this issue is picking up steam 
lambert said were not making demands in a vacuum 
in the last 10 years at least five major universities in 
florida wisconsin michigan oregon and new jersey have recognized 
graduate student assistants as employees 
teaching assistants at the university of wisconsin in madison 
won collective bargaining from the legislature in 1985 their 
union affiliated with the american federation of teachers is 
negotiating their second contract 
at the university of michigan in ann arbor the university and 
its newly organized teaching assistants reached a collective 
bargaining agreement earlier this year giving assistants a 14 
percent pay raise over the next two years 
at the university of massachusetts at amherst the coordinating 
committe of the teaching assistants union voted last week to 
affiliate with the uaw 
the berkeley union has been seeking recognition since 1983 last 
week the state public employment relations board ruling 21 in 
favor of a university appeal said a 1979 law forbids graduate 
students from being treated as employees because their work duties 
are part of scholarly training 
the association plans to appeal to court 
at the start of berkeleys school day sproul plaza where 
onefifth of students generally enter was unusually quiet 
protesters handed out yellow armbands to supporters 
the teaching assistants are the university when it comes to 
learning here said undergraduate cammy starks 21 who said her 
morning classes had been canceled and wore an armband everything 
ive learned ive learned from the assistants not professors who 
hardly ever get to know you 
anthropology professor gerald berreman who joined pickets said 
graduate students handle 90 percent of the paper grading im 
here to show them how important they are to faculty he said 
on tuesday 71 professors in 10 departments sent a letter to 
chancellor ira michael heyman endorsing the walkout and the 
associations call for teaching assistants to cancel or reschedule 
classes berkeley has 1350 tenured professors 
the association said that at least 500 wednesday and thursday 
classes were canceled or rescheduled 
according to a selective survey by the association of 307 
classes through wednesday afternoon 66 percent were canceled 25 
percent were less than halffull and 9 percent were at capacity 
university spokesman tom debley said the results were not 
necessarily representative of the campus which has 23000 
undergraduates he said its not unusual for some students to skip 
classes in the final weeks before finals to gain time to prepare 
papers 
debley said the cost of pay raises and for providing health and 
other benefits could have a substantial impact on university 
budgets 
according to a study by the association teaching assistants 
handle 58 percent of classroom work involving undergraduate 
students and research assistants do about half the laboratory work 
the university contends the work cannot be considered employment 
because it is so intertwined with educational experience debley 
said students receive annual stipends from the university or 
research institutions averaging about 10000 annually 
it is more of a learning experience than an employment 
experience debley said

the 1970s

alicia and the 12yearold twins gonzalo and matias were placed 
aboard an argentine commercial jetliner on a regular flight to 
buenos aires

the children feel very badly and obviously im not doing too 
well either miara told reporters shortly before police arrived 
at their asuncion home to take them to the airport 
another couple former argentine army maj norberto bianco and 
his wife susana are awaiting final legal proceedings in a similar 
case involving two children

authoritarian president gen alfredo stroessner in april 1986

pregnant women who disappeared during a military crackdown on 
leftist subversion 
both couples refused to return to argentina claiming they were 
victims of political persecution and would not receive a fair trial 
argentine requests for the extradition of the couples were tied

the judge in the oliver north trial said 
wednesday he has imposed a 9to5 workday on the jury but wont 
push harder for a verdict in the deliberations which continued 
inconclusively for the 11th day 
i see no reason why i should intervene with the jury at all 
us district judge gerhard a gesell told lawyers for north and 
the government both of whom had raised questions about the 
lengthy deliberations 
there is nothing the court can do to say that people must 
deliberate he said i have no reason to think they arent 
deliberating they are human beings and they are going to set their 
own pace 
gesell pointed out that not long ago a jury in this courthouse 
took two months to reach a decision apparently referring to the 
trial of nine members of a black hebrew sect convicted on 
racketeering charges in 1986 by a jury that deliberated 200 hours 
over 36 days 
the nine women and three men on the north jury generally have 
worked on the case five or six hours each weekday and a halfday on 
saturday 
i felt that time was being wasted gesell said they are 
not starting as early as they could have and they have been leaving 
at 415 i felt i should hold them in there until five 
he said he told us marshals who transport the jurors from the 
hotel where they are sequestered to get them in by nine and take 
them home by five 
and so at 503 pm the van pulled away from the courthouse 
and the jury had completed another seven hours of work a total of 
about 60 hours since it got the case on april 20 a court official 
said deliberations stopped at 445 
prosecutor john keker had suggested that gesell might summon 
jurors to the courtroom each day to learn what hours they wanted to 
work the following day and to advise them they could deliberate 
longer 
the judge said the new hours would take care of that and an 
eighthour day was reasonable the jurors he said worked shorter 
days earlier because several suffered from colds and one had 
problems with high blood pressure 
north lawyer brendan sullivan asked why the jurors who had been 
using gesells courtroom had returned to a smaller deliberation 
room where they had complained of being crowded 
gesell said he needed the courtroom for other business and the 
crowding problem had been solved by removing excess chairs 
i think well just have to wait it out together until we hear 
something concrete from them he told the lawyers 
keker replied that we are running out of books to read in 
our office 
said gesell i understand there is a movie you could look at 
an apparent reference to the twopart television drama on the 
rise and fall of oliver north that finished tuesday night 
charges against north include lying to congress and the attorney 
general and obstructing investigations into the irancontra affair 
particularly his white house efforts to help the nicaraguan rebels 
at a time when official us aid was banned other charges accuse 
north of illegally profiting from the enterprise 
meanwhile the justice department urged gesell to deny a news 
media request for a document that was given to the jury but not to 
the press the department said the news organizations should pursue 
the matter through the defense department the executive branch 
agency responsible for classifying the information at issue 
said the justice department this court cannot serve as a 
substitute for such a process 
the organizations pressing for the document a summary of 
intelligence intercepts made while a shipment of missiles was 
being sent to iran in 1985 are the associated press cable news

the united states and japan have reached a 
tentative agreement over driftnet fishing in the northern pacific 
ocean rep jolene unsoeld said wednesday 
unsoeld dwash outlined details of what she said is an 
agreement that might end the dispute over use of the huge nets she 
was critical of the pact 
an estimated 700 fishing boats from taiwan south korea and 
japan use driftnets which can stretch 35 miles in length and cover 
more than 30000 square miles of ocean on any given day 
american fishermen claim that vessels from taiwan south korea 
and japan use driftnets to illegally snare millions of tons of 
salmon under the guise of squid fishing fishing groups have said 
the illegal fishing has already impacted salmon runs in alaska 
washington state and oregon 
unsoeld dwash released what she said are details of the 
pact based on talks with unnamed officials from the state 
department and the us fishing industry 
she said the pact calls for

2 observers stationed aboard japanese driftnet vessels to 
monitor their catch there are an estimated 400 vessels in the 
japanese driftnet fleet 
an increase from four to five in the number of japanese patrol 
vessels in the north pacific and an increase in patrol days for the 
vessels from the current 250 per year to 600 per year us 
enforcement officers will be stationed aboard the patrol vessels 
stiffer japanese penalties for ships caught illegally driftnet 
fishing 
marking of all driftnets so the owners of those cast adrift 
can be identified 
a ban on the highseas transfer of fish between japanese 
trawlers and freighters which carry the fish back to port 
unsoeld said the japanese refused to agree to a us state 
department request for a pilot program to place transponders on a 
dozen or so japanese vessels using satellites the us could have 
monitored the movements of the ships 
the us is considering a transponder test using american 
vessels unsoeld said 
other congressional sources who asked not to be identified 
confirmed most of the details supplied by unsoeld but added that 
the agreement was for only one year and the japanese have 
essentially told the state department take it or leave it 
the sources also said the japanese have indicated they plan to 
move the legal driftnet zone slightly northward though exactly how 
far remains unclear 
the existing driftnet zone was designed to keep fishing vessels 
far south of the migration routes of north american salmon 
ed wolfe the state departments ambassador for ocean and 
fisheries was out of his office and unavailable for comment 
wednesday earlier this week wolfe told a house subcommittee that 
an agreement with the japanese was close 
congressional sources said the agreement has actually been 
signed by japanese officials and initialed by us negotiators 
i am extremely apprehensive that this agreement will not be 
adequate said unsoeld i am also not sure that this will meet 
the requirements of the 1987 driftnet act 
under that act if japan and other countries with driftnet 
fleets have not entered into monitoring and enforcement agreements 
with the united states by june 29 the president could impose trade 
sanctions 
unsoeld said she was upset that the japanese had refused to 
agree to a transponder test program 
we may have negotiated away our ability to put any teeth in 
our action she said its absolutely goofy if they arent 
violating any existing agreements why are they objecting to us 
placing transponders on their ships 
unsoeld also said she felt the number of observers called for in 
the agreement falls short of what was needed to provide 
sufficient data on the impact of driftnet fishing

stabbed to death two elderly israelis and wounded three others 
wednesday at a bus stop in the heart of jewish west jerusalem 
police said 
in the occupied west bank a palestinian laborer stabbed and 
slightly wounded a jew from etz efraim a small settlement near the 
arab city of qalqilya the army said israel radio said the 
settler 38yearold levi meshumar was stabbed five times 
after the stabbing in jerusalem police used tear gas to break 
up a march by jewish extremists who were led by americanborn 
rabbi meir kahane and shouted revenge kahane and six followers 
were arrested on charges of disturbing public order and refusing 
orders to disperse 
members of kahanes antiarab kach party later beat up several 
arabs near a jewish orthodox neighborhood israel army radio 
reported 
west jerusalem has been relatively free of violence that has 
plagued arab east jerusalem and the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip since the palestinian uprising began 17 months ago 
the stabbing occurred on jaffa road the citys busiest shopping 
street at about 11 am dozens of passersby chased and caught the 
25yearold attacker as he fled with a bloody eightinch knife 
police dragged the suspect into a nearby flower shop to protect him 
from an angry crowd shouting death to the terrorists death to 
the arabs 
vardi kalman a 60yearold lawyer died shortly afterward 
nissim levy 91 died later in a hospital the other victims 
including a woman in her 90s were in fair condition 
prime minister yitzhak shamir linked the stabbing to plo head 
yasser arafats current visit to france 
this is a cruel murder by fanatical savages mad with hate 
who are pushed to such acts also by this kind of visits when they 
see their leader and idol arafat received in presidential 
palaces they know hes received their thanks for their killings 
he said 
speaking on israel television shamir said it did not matter to 
what group the attacker belonged because his act was in arafats 
spirit and according to his orders and the orders of his friends 
they have not changed and are not able to change anything in their 
ideology aspirations hopes and aims 
there was speculation the stabbing came in response to arafats 
statement in paris disavowing the plo charter which calls for the 
elimination of israel defense minister yitzhak rabin said the 
assailant was a member of islamic jihad a fundamentalist moslem 
group opposed to israels existence

unspecified terrorist activities in the past they said he 
apparently had no accomplices 
romi shimon who was sitting in a nearby restaurant when the 
attack occurred said the man shouted allahu akbar god is 
great in arabic 
he was going crazy and started stabbing people shimon said 
sima ozer an employee in a nearby flower shop said the arab 
was caught outside

us trade representative carla hills on 
wednesday released a target list of japanese products which could 
face 100 percent duties doubling their price in this country 
under trade retaliation being considered by the bush administration 
the list of potential target products for the higher tariffs 
ranges from color televisions to tape recorders and photocopying 
machines 
the broad variety of goods including some of the most popular 
japanese electronic devices sold in this country served to 
emphasize the seriousness with which the bush administration is 
viewing this latest trade dispute with japan 
mrs hills announced on friday that the government was 
considering sanctions against japan because of a finding by the 
administration that the country has not opened its 
telecommunications market to american companies 
mrs hills said at the time that the retaliation could be 
avoided if the japanese make meaningful concessions 
a final list of products which could be subject to the higher 
tariffs will be drawn up after a hearing scheduled for may 24 that 
list will be selected from the broader one released on wednesday 
in making the telecommunications decision mrs hills found that 
japan had limited us access to its market for car telephones and 
business radios 
the motorola co the principal american maker of these 
products has contended that it has been denied access to the 
japanese market it maintains that with fair access it could 
achieve sales in japan of about 400 million a year 
the japanese have argued that there is a shortage of radio 
frequencies for such services

boston universitys controversial plan to 
run chelseas ailing schools went to state lawmakers wednesday 
with supporters confident the promised renaissance will dispel 
doubts about putting a public concern in private hands 
this is the happiest day of my 45 years in chelsea said 
mayor john brennan who sent the legislature a home rule petition 
that would install boston university as manager of its school 
system 
the proposal has the backing of democrat richard voke chairman 
of the powerful house ways and means committee and is expected to 
pass others were less enthusiastic 
school committee chairwoman elizabeth mcbride was against the 
proposal citing concerns that the university would not consult 
with parents teachers and administrators 
supporters say the plan is chelseas last chance to escape the 
plague of poverty shabby buildings low test scores and a high 
school dropout rate of 17 percent 
opponents including teachers and hispanic groups say the 
proposal also would turn chelsea into a experimental education 
laboratory for university students 
hispanics oppose the contract signed by representatives of 
boston university and chelseas schools saying university 
officials have ignored requests for more information about 
bilingual programs 
boston university president john silber said he would heed 
concerns raised 
we are not going to privatize the schools silber said we 
are going to manage the public schools and they are going to remain 
public 
the massachusetts federation of teachers criticized the signing 
of the contract before lawmakers act as indicative of the private 
and arrogant manner in which the entire process has been 
conducted 
chelsea a city of about 25000 with a sizable immigrant 
population has seen its tax base shrink and faces cuts of about 
28 million in next years school budget due to a statewide budget 
crunch 
silber said he would lobby for funds from private donors the 
federal government and the state advertising the reforms of 
chelsea as a possible road to reviving the area a few miles from 
boston 
chelsea is a city waiting for a renaissance to happen 
silber said if we can improve those schools people will move 
back into chelsea

the house interior committee on wednesday 
approved legislation to protect open land and build recreational 
facilities but republicans on the committee walked out in protest 
before the committee took its vote 
the bill known as the american heritage trust act would make 
the existing land and water conservation fund and historic 
preservation fund permanent trusts that would generate 1 billion a 
year for land acquisition and construction of recreational 
facilities like golf courses ball fields pools and marinas 
republicans on the committee objected to more government buying 
of land 
this nations heritage is private ownership of land not 
public owners and control said rep larry craig ridaho 
but rep morris udall dariz chairman of the committee said 
the bill is necessary because too many communities in the united 
states are being overdeveloped with insufficient recreational 
facilities 
craig said the republicans walked out when it became apparent 
that amendments they offered would not get through

contracts to friends

rivers a close friend of barry also faces two counts of 
agreeing to accept a bribe while clyburn has been charged with

a judge who freed a man imprisoned for 21 
years in the poisoning deaths of his seven children said the 
killers identity may never be known and raised several questions 
about the investigation and prosecution 
james richardson 53 was released from prison april 25 after 
judge clifton kelly determined his 1968 trial was unfair the 
former orange picker has moved to a diet clinic run by former 
comedian dick gregory in fort walton beach 
a written order overturning richardsons conviction was filed 
tuesday by kelly a retired circuit judge appointed to hear the 
case kelly offered a long list of unresolved questions in the case 
janet reno a special prosecutor who found evidence of 
substantial trial errors and perjured testimony still must 
recommend whether richardson should face retrial 
he was serving a life sentence for firstdegree murder in the 
poisoning death of his eldest stepdaughter oct 25 1967 
kellys order asked who should be blamed for the unfair trial 
why anyone would have wanted to frame richardson as the defense 
contended and why three cellmates who testified against richardson 
told contradictory stories 
the judge also wondered how a wino who lived near the 
richardsons found a bag of the pesticide parathion after an 
unsuccessful police search why former police chief richard barnard 
was told to stay off the case how family baby sitter betsy resse 
served the poisoned meal and why parathion was found in other parts 
of the apartment 
at this late date who really poisoned the children will quite 
likely never be known kelly wrote 
prosecutors claimed richardson poisoned the children to collect 
on 1000 insurance policies but the jury was never told that the 
insurance hadnt been purchased 
because reno and richardsons attorneys agreed the trial was 
unfair kelly said it would serve no useful purpose for the 
court to now make a detailed finding of fact 
kelly didnt rule on whether prosecutors or investigators 
suppressed evidence or committed perjury gov bob martinez ordered 
an investigation of the allegations of public wrongdoing after 
richardson was freed

a palm springs woman who rushed out of 
her shower to dance to a gladys knight video and was arrested after 
neighbors peering through her window filed a complaint has sued the 
police 
darleen scott who was jailed and lost her two girls to the 
state for two days sued the palm springs public safety department 
on tuesday for false arrest harassment and false imprisonment in 
the january 1988 incident 
i was treated like a murderer like i was no good i was in my 
own house minding my own business said ms scott a 31yearold 
nurses aide 
she said she had asked her daughters to call her out of the 
shower if a music video of the song love overboard by gladys 
knight and the pips appeared on the television 
neighbors peering through a window into her thirdfloor 
apartment thought she was nude when she rushed into her living room 
to dance to the song and filed a child abuse report with the 
police she later told officers she was wearing a brown towel 
she was arrested on three counts of lewd and lascivious behavior 
in the presence of a child her two daughters and a 14yearold 
girl looking through the window said west palm beach attorney w 
trent steele who is representing ms scott on behalf of the 
american civil liberties union 
while she spent a night in the palm beach county stockade her 
daughters aged three and 10 at the time spent about two days in 
separate foster homes 
the separation was prolonged because social workers with the 
state department of health and rehabilitative services couldnt 
find one of the girls after they placed her in a home steele 
said 
the state attorneys office dropped all the charges against 
scott in may 1988

a yap islander found drifting in a life raft 
told authorities he abandoned his tuna boat after fumes from 
rotting fish apparently killed two other men aboard the vessel 
according to the coast guard 
coast guard and navy ships were sent to tow the vessel to port 
but their crews were warned to stay upwind to avoid the fumes 
lawrence moon who was safely aboard the coast guard cutter cape 
corwin on wednesday told authorities he abandoned the 85foot 
seattlebased trawler margaret g after fumes overcame two crewmates 
in a matter of seconds said coast guard spokesman keith 
spangler 
moon told officials after his rescue tuesday that the trawlers 
refrigeration system failed during a trip to honolulu that began 
april 22 at american samoa a us territory about 2300 miles 
south of hawaii spangler said yap part of the federated states 
of micronesia is about 540 miles southwest of guam 
moon said that on sunday the other crewmember went down into a 
hold and did not return and when the captain went to investigate 
he was also overcome leaving moon alone according to spangler 
moon told authorities he headed the vessel toward honolulu but 
had problems with a steering linkage and later a generator 
malfunction spangler said 
on monday moon said he woke to find himself succumbing to the 
fumes so he abandoned the vessel after closing all the hatches 
spangler said 
spangler said the crewmen may have been overcome by hydrogen 
sulfide which is produced by rotting organic material 
it is very toxic and it takes the oxygen out of the air 
spangler said if its rotting fish this could happen 
the japanese ship sun harvest rescued moon tuesday evening 300 
miles south of honolulu spangler said moon was later transferred 
to the coast guard cutter and was reported in good condition and 
good spirits 
coast guard and navy ships were at the scene wednesday but were 
instructed to remain 2000 yards upwind from the margaret g 
spangler said crewmembers were told to rig the vessel for towing 
but not to go below deck he added 
the fumes are really bad he said the vessel will be 
towed to honolulu but a decision has not been made what to do 
after that 
spangler said the investigation was complicated by the fact that 
hydrogen sulfide is highly combustible 
moons raft was spotted tuesday morning by the crew of a coast 
guard plane following an emergency distress beacon signal that was 
picked up by commercial aircraft and the worldwide search and 
rescue satellite assisted tracking computer system said spokesman 
dave goff 
moon was about two miles from the margaret g which when viewed 
from the air showed no evidence of damage and no sign of life 
spangler said 
a coast guard life raft containing a radio and food and water 
was dropped and moon swam to it from his raft to await pickup by 
the japanese ship goff said

if students and workers continue the kind of violent protest in 
which six riot policemen were killed 
he said his government was determined to stop the wave of 
radical protest that has battered south korea in recent weeks but 
he did not outline specific action in a televised speech to the 
nation 
if violence and illegal acts endanger democracy and the future 
of the country i would be obliged to invoke emergency measures as 
empowered by the constitution he said 
south koreas constitution permits the president to rule by 
decree or impose martial law in cases of emergency 
radical students are trying to bring down rohs government and 
have forrmed alliances with striking workers they are a powerful 
minority on campuses but lack public support because of their 
extremism and violent tactics 
rohs warning responded to the killing of six riot troopers 
early wednesday at dongui university in pusan a southern 
stronghold of the opposition 
people seldom are killed in south korean protests riot officers 
wear protective helmets and shields along with fireproof fatigues 
and normally are armed only with tear gas and batons 
the six who died were set afire when they broke into a room on 
the seventh floor of the university library to free five comrades 
held hostage they were the first policemen killed since a riot 
officer died in june 1987

violent demonstration against the firing of warning shots by police 
on monday when protesters menaced a police station 
students hurled firebombs and set fire to a barricade drenched 
with paint thinner as the policemen were climbing over it some 
officers wrapped in flames jumped out of windows and others were 
burned to death or asphyxiated police said 
ten officers were in critical condition and police said they 
expected more to die officials said about 10 other policemen and 
students suffered minor injuries 
about 700 police raided the school firing tear gas 
eightyeight arrests were reported and the hostages later were 
freed unharmed 
jo jongsuk chief of the national police resigned after about 
150 officers in pusan conducted a sitdown protest and accused 
senior officers of mishandling the assault his office said it was 
the worst loss of police life in recent years 
the education ministry ordered the dongui campus closed 
indefinitely 
roh said in his speech wednesday it has become clear that 
behind the flames that took the lives of young people there are 
revolutionary groups which resort to violence to achieve their 
goals 
he said the government was prepared to crush radical groups and 
halt what he called the use of universities and factories as 
revolutionary bases it is time for us to make a firm resolution 
to mobilize whatever means to get rid of violence in this society 
opposition leaders also denounced violence and urged students 
and workers to end their protests 
news reports wednesday said the us cultural center in the 
provincial city of kwangju a frequent target of radical students 
would be closed temporarily and moved to a location as yet 
undetermined

entire 13minister centerright cabinet in a clash over part of a 
365 billion plan to clean up the heavily polluted dutch 
environment by the year 2010

two men who wrote a book claiming they helped 
soviet spy george blake escape to moscow from a london jail 33 
years ago were arrested on wednesday 
patrick pottle 50 and michael randle 55 went to a london 
police sation at the request of the police and were arrested 
scotland yard said 
they were then escorted to their homes pottle in london and 
randle in the northern town of bradford yorkshire 
they were not charged a police spokesman speaking anonymously 
said they would be granted bail while a report was sent to the 
director of public prosectuions who is responsible for deciding on 
prosecution 
officers from scotland yards special branch which deals with 
subversion were searching pottles home when a reporter telephoned 
him 
they are putting things in bags ive been expecting this so 
i gathered some items together and they have been in a pile on the 
kitchen table for about 10 days waiting pottle said 
pottle an antiques dealer added that he and randle a 
researcher expect to go to prison eventually 
a new book titled the blake escape by the two men and a tv 
film about the case described how they harbored blake after he 
broke out of wormwood scrubs prison in 1966 and how randle smuggled 
him out of britain in a camper van to east germany 
sean bourke a former fellow prisoner of blake directed his 
escape by radio messages bourke now dead later wrote a book 
describing how he was invited to the soviet union and treated as a 
hero by the soviet kgb secret police 
bourke did not mention pottle and randle in his book last year 
they admitted their part in the case to a reporter 
blake was sentenced to 42 years and jailed in 1961 after 
pleading guilty to spying for the soviets throughout the 1950s 
while working for mi6 the british intelligence gathering agency 
the sentence the longest sentence for espionage ever handed down 
by a british court was regarded as representing one year for each 
betrayed agent 
at the end of a secret trial the judge said blake was suspected 
of betraying 42 british agents in eastern europe who are believed 
to have been killed 
pottle and randle were founder members with the philosopher 
bertrand russell of the committee of 100 which protested nuclear 
weapons they met blake in prison while serving 18month sentences 
for organizing a demonstration at a us air force base 
the two men said they helped the spy escape because they felt a 
42year sentence was inhumane 
more than 100 lawmakers of the governing conservative party 
signed a house of commons paper demanding pottle and randle be 
prosecuted

the senate went on record wednesday against 
gasoline tax increases as it and the house cleared roadblocks to 
approving budgets that carry out a muchcriticized 
deficitreduction agreement with the white house 
the antigas tax amendment offered by sen steve symms 
ridaho passed by voice vote and expressed the sense of the 
senate that motor fuel taxes should remain dedicated to 
improvements in the highway and transportation system 
the vote was a shot across the bow to those eyeing a rise in the 
gas tax now at 91 cents a gallon as part of future 
deficitreduction efforts there is no call for such a tax in the 
117 trillion fiscal 1990 spending plans now before congress 
sources have said the bush administration has been considering a 
gas tax increase combined with a reduction in the capital gains 
tax in the fiscal 1991 budget to be submitted next year 
the current spending plan which the house and the senate are 
considering in slightly different versions claims about 28 
billion in deficit reductions and would meet the goal in the 
grammrudman law of a deficit no larger than 100 billion in fiscal 
1990 which begins oct 1 
critics contend much of the alleged savings is illusory 
bookkeeping gimmicks sales of federal assets and other devices 
that do little to alleviate the governments longterm deficit 
problem 
the senates democratic and republican leaders withstood the 
first serious challenge to their budget plan wednesday evening 
defeating 6431 a move by sen paul simon dill to shift 3 
billion from defense to education programs 
simon argued that for the nation to remain economically 
competitive there are going to have to be some changes in our 
priorities 
but he ran into the opposition of the senates leadership which 
has defended congress budget deal with the white house and the 
spending levels that the pact calls for 
we made an agreement and i believe it is a responsible and 
fair agreement said senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine 
in the house debate opened on that chambers version of the 
budget after passage of a resolution blocking all but a handful of 
amendments those that house leaders believed would not pose a 
threat to the deal 
this budget is the best possible budget congress can produce 
for 1990 given the many constraints under which it was 
developed said rep leon panetta dcalif the chairman of the 
house budget committee while not a bold approach it is at 
best a step in the right direction he said 
rep dan rostenkowski dill the chairman of thehouse ways and 
means committee has openly suggested a gas tax increase but he 
told the house he would not offer such legislation without bushs 
support 
i will not encourage or support revenue increases that dont 
have the support of the president and a majority of members of both 
sides of the aisle on my committee he said 
much of the senate action wednesday amounted to tinkering around 
with priorities in the domestic area and passing nonbinding 
amendments regarding truth in budgeting 
the senate approved amendments deploring the use of the social 
security surplus to mask the size of the deficit it also called 
for future use of budget projections compiled by the congressional 
budget office which are less sanguine than white house figures 
it also voted to add 94 million for aids research and about 
100 million for law enforcement by slightly reducing other 
domestic agency budgets 
the house planned votes thursday on several amendments 
including a spending freeze plan and a proposal to impose a fee on 
imported oil 
once the house and senate complete their budgets the two 
chambers must agree on a single resolution that document serves as 
the guide for annual spending and tax legislation 
to comply with the agreement reached last month with the white 
house the budgets follow totals already agreed to for military 
foreign aid and domestic spending they also call for 142 billion 
in new revenues from a variety of sources including 53 billion 
in tax increases 
how the 53 billion will be raised remains uncertain the 
agreement with the white house allowed that decision to await more 
discussions on what taxes bush would agree do not violate his no 
new taxes pledge 
the senate finance committee chairman sen lloyd bentsen 
dtexas indicated he would seek tax increases exceeding 53 
billion to pay for some tax breaks that would cost the government 
money 
bentsen did not specify what new taxes he supports but he 
listed several tax breaks he favors including the tax credit for 
research and development and a cut in the medicare surtax for 
catastrophic illness insurance 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he was 
confident something could be worked out he reminded reporters that 
former president reagan proposed and signed 13 tax hikes and yet 
was seen as an enemy of higher taxes

americans want the united nations not 
national governments to control nuclear and chemical weapons and 
to take the lead in keeping peace in the world according to a poll 
released wednesday 
the roper organization survey also found strong support for 
increased american financing of un programs for peace food 
production population control and health 
in conflicts among countries where the united states has an 
interest un forces should be used in an effort to accommodate 
all parties said 49 percent of the nearly 2000 adults surveyed 
only 17 percent said the united states should use force to 
impose its own solution 20 percent said it depends and 14 
percent had no opinion 
that is in effect a tough policy choice and we were 
surprised to see a 3to1 margin of support for un intervention 
rather than unilateral us intervention said jeffrey laurenti 
of the un association of the usa a private nonprofit group 
that commissioned the poll 
of the respondents 46 percent wanted america and other un 
members to spend more money settling regional conflicts peacefully 
11 percent favored less spending 31 percent said the right amount 
is spent now and 11 percent had no opinion 
the united nations should have the power to control the 
manufacture and spread of chemical weapons in the united states and 
other countries said 49 percent but 33 percent opposed that and 
18 percent were unsure 
un control over nuclear weapons manufacture and proliferation 
was favored by 36 percent the same percentage opposed it and 18 
percent were unsure 
sixty percent said all un members should pay their full dues 
regularly rather than withholding funds to force changes fourteen 
percent said funds could be withheld the same number said it 
depends and 12 percent had no opinion 
president reagan and congress withheld more than a 500 million 
from the united nations in recent years to force fiscal reforms and 
because they perceived an antiwestern bias in the organization 
reagan finally said the united states would pay all back dues if 
current reforms continued and president bush has reaffirmed the 
pledge 
when asked how much money the united states and other un 
member countries should spend on un projects the respondents 
favored more funds for most social programs including eradicating 
disease and improving health care slowing population growth 
through birth control increasing world food production and 
protecting the environment 
burns roper head of the roper organization said the poll 
indicated for the first time in more than a decade that more 
americans thought the united nations was doing a good job than felt 
it was doing poorly 
it was conducted march 1118 through personal interviews with 
nearly 2000 adults chosen at random roper said the margin of 
error was about 3 percent

the bush administration on wednesday announced 
a partial resolution of a contentious trade dispute with the 
12nation european community over the issue of hormones in american 
beef 
us trade representative carla hills and agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter said that both us and european negotiators had 
agreed to accept the initial recommendations of a task force 
studying the dispute 
that action will allow resumption of sales of about 15 percent 
of the 100 million us beef which is normally shipped to europe 
however a dispute over the other 85 percent of us beef exports 
remains to be resolved us officials said 
under the agreement us beef producers who wish to export beef 
not treated with growth hormones to europe may do so 
but american officials said they still maintained that europes 
ban on imports of beef from cattle raised on growthproducing 
hormones represented an illegal trade barrier masquerading as a 
health measure 
american officials had refused to comply with the ban by 
certifying europebound beef as hormonefree and instead slapped 
retaliatory tariffs on european goods valued at about 100 million 
a sum equal to the lost sales of american beef 
however after the tariffs were imposed on jan 1 by the reagan 
administration officials of the incoming bush administration began 
to search for a compromise to the dispute 
at a meeting on feb 18 mrs hills and yeutter agreed to look 
for a way to certify as hormonefree as much us beef as possible 
at the time the united states indicated it would reduce its 
100 million in punitive tariffs by the amount of us beef europe 
was willing to accept 
the agreement wednesday follows the recommendations of a task 
force of officials from both sides established to study the matter 
the partial resolution will cover high quality grades of beef being 
shipped to europe but will not cover the other 85 percent of beef 
trade which includes socalled variety meats such as livers 
tongues and kidneys 
mrs hills said that the task force studying the situation will 
continue searching for ways to include more american beef and will 
report back before june 15 
in a statement mrs hills called the interim agreement a 
positive step toward deescalating what had become a 
contentious dispute between america and one of its largest trading 
partners 
to the extent that us beef and beef products are shipped to 
the european community under this measure we will reduce us 
retaliatory measures on imports from the ec she said 
yeutter said that while the us position remains the same that 
american beef containing the hormones presents no health risk the 
administration did not want to stand in the way of producers who 
are willing and able to meet the ecs requirements for 
hormonefree beef 
under the agreement american ranchers who want to export 
hormonefree beef to europe will be given a set of requirements 
that they will have to meet by european officials who will also 
establish a monitoring system to insure that the beef being shipped 
does not contain hormones

us ambassador thomas pickering said 
wednesday the united states probably will cut off funding to the 
world health organization if it admits the plo and would do the 
same to any other un agency that admits the plo 
pickering told reporters the palestine liberation organization 
should withdraw or postpone its application to join the who when it 
meets in geneva next week he said the united states had been 
conducting a vigorous lobbying campaign against the membership 
the united states has made known it is not prepared to fund 
who under these circumstances plo membership because the plo is 
not by legal definition a state pickering said 
he said plo membership would harm the who and endanger the 
delicate peace process in the middle east by polarizing the 
situation 
last week secretary of state james a baker iii said the state 
department would recommend to congress that who funding be 
withdrawn if the organization admits the plo pickering extended 
the threat to any other un agency that might admit the plo 
no other un agencies have indicated they are considering 
admitting the plo as a member 
the united states donates one quarter of the annual who budget 
or approximately 75 million 
zuhdi labib terzi the plos permanent un observer said he 
had no immediate comment on pickerings statement about other un 
agencies earlier however he said the plo would press ahead with 
efforts to join the who despite us threats 
to be admitted to the 166member who the plo needs a simple 
majority vote when the agency meets may 8 admission would enhance 
the plos credibility and prestige in the international community 
there is anguish that this is illtimed pickering a former 
ambassador to israel told reporters this is a wrong and 
illconceived notion and it is time to try to find a formula or a 
way to postpone this 
he said the united states would not object if the who 
established a group to study the question 
although the united states decided last year to establish a 
dialogue with the plo it does not recognize the selfdeclared 
palestinian state in israels occupied territories 
pickering said that even some key arab states do not support plo 
membership because the plo does not satisfy the traditional 
definition of statehood 
he conceded that a halt to us funding could harm worthy who 
programs like those on aids and nutrition but he said there would 
be discussions on how the united states could continue to spend the 
funds effectively

to the british public winston silcott is the 
leader of a mob that hacked a policeman to death in a north london 
riot 
but to some students at the worldrenowned london school of 
economics his conviction and life sentence are an injustice by 
making silcott the honorary president of their student union they 
have provoked a furious response from the government as well as 
fellow students 
people who come here are supposed to be intelligent if that 
is so how can they elect this lunatic asked daniel kasmir a 
20yearold social sciences freshman between classes at the 
central london campus on wednesday it gives the college a bad 
name 
in parliament education secretary kenneth baker branded 
silcotts election shameful and despicable and told parliament 
this is the loony left hijacking a great institution 
but mike cronshaw 23 a postgraduate in economics said the 
union had achieved its aim to refocus attention on the validity of 
the convictions of 49 young men after bloody rioting in the 
racially mixed tottenham district on oct 16 1985 in which a 
white policeman was killed 
if we do believe in british standards of justice the 
beyondreasonabledoubt criterion then if it is not seen to be 
applied by normal standards there is grounds for a retrial 
cronshaw said 
about 100 leftwing students elected 29yearold silcott to the 
oneyear ceremonial term at the unions sparsely attended annual 
general meeting thursday a bigger turnout tried to reverse the 
decision at an angry meeting tuesday but failed by 26 votes to 
achieve the necessary twothirds majority 
the national union of students announced wednesday it will hold 
a secret ballot of the colleges 4000 students 
college governors pledged to review the college unions funding 
while the schools afrocaribbean society denounced the vote as 
deplorable insensitive and patronizing to the black race 
silcott and another black along with a turkish teenager were 
convicted of murdering keith blakelock with machetes and 43 out of 
69 others were convicted and jailed for riot and affray 
more than 500 youths fought battles with police in and around 
the broadwater farm housing project in the worst of a wave of 
racial unrest in british cities in the fall of 1985 it was the 
first riot to claim a policemans life 
shaun waterman 24 a spokesman for the broadwater farm defense 
campaign says the hunt for the killers turned into basically a 
lucky dip a lottery 
the police needed scapegoats they wanted revenge for the 
killing of one of their colleagues he claimed in an interview 
civil libertarians have also cast doubt on the fairness of the 
trials amnesty international the human rights group investigated 
the case and concluded that the police forced many suspects to sign 
confessions and denied them full access to lawyers 
it said confessions formed the basis of the prosecution evidence 
against nearly all defendants charged with felonies 
while in custody silcott denied involvement in the killing and 
refused to answer most police questions police alleged that in his 
final interview he told an officer you aint got enough 
evidence those kids wont give evidence in court no one will talk 
to you you cant keep me away from them silcott denied using 
those words 
silcotts defenders say police also presented conflicting 
testimony about his whereabouts during the riot 
in 1987 a jury found silcott guilty and judge sir derek hodgson 
sentenced him to a minimum 30 years in prison calling him a very 
evil and a very dangerous man 
the judge disclosed that silcott already was out on bail for 
another murder when the riot broke out 
lord gifford a civil rights campaigner and former judge 
condemned the trials as a blot on the reputation of british 
justice in a report he concluded that the whole process from 
first to last was arbitrary unfair and not conducive to bringing 
guilty people to justice 
gifford told students tuesday that there was no evidence to 
convict silcott it was a terrible crime and the more terrible a 
crime the greater is the emotion and the danger of prejudice 
particularly racial prejudice

the man who was skipper of the tanker 
exxon valdez when it struck a reef and caused the nations largest 
oil spill pleaded innocent wednesday to criminal charges including 
operating the vessel while drunk 
joseph hazelwood 42 entered the plea through his attorney in a 
15minute proceeding before state judge david stewart hazelwood 
who was silent and declined to answer reporters questions was 
ushered out a back door of the courtroom immediately after the 
hearing 
hazelwood who was fired by exxon after the accident is charged 
with operating a vessel while drunk reckless endangerment and 
negligent discharge of oil stemming from the march 24 incident 
which dumped more than 10 million gallons of crude into prince 
william sound 
his attorney presented a 50000 check for bail after stewart 
rejected a request to lower the amount to 25000 
stewart scheduled the trial for june 20 in valdez but one of 
hazelwoods lawyers dan dennis said he would seek to transfer the 
trial to another area there will undoubtedly be a change of 
venue request dennis said 
stewart also said a grand jury has launched an investigation to 
determine whether additional charges should be filed against 
hazelwood he did not elaborate 
the state meanwhile was under pressure from the federal 
government to respond to exxons controversial plan for cleaning up 
oilfouled seashore 
state authorities reported increasing damage on the alaska 
peninsula and at katmai national park 
its a very thick moussetype stuff six to eight inches 
thick hitting in blotches said bill lamoreaux a state 
environmental official its definitely a difficult type of 
cleanup operation its close to shore and rolling up on shore 
federal transportation secretary samuel skinner was to inspect 
the spill zone and vice president dan quayle scheduled a visit 
thursday on his return from asia 
after the spill hazelwood went home to huntington ny where 
he was arrested on a fugitive warrant but he returned voluntarily 
wednesday and surrendered not even waiting for an extradition 
hearing he had been free on 25000 bail in new york and a 
prosecutor said wednesday he would move to dismiss the fugitive 
charge and return the bail money 
on the night of the spill hazelwood allegedly turned over 
control of the 987footlong exxon valdez to an uncertified mate 
the tanker was outside shipping lanes when it rammed a reef and 
ripped its bottom letting the alaskan north slope crude oil pour 
out 
authorities say hazelwood who has a history of alcoholrelated 
driving arrests in new york had a bloodalcohol level of 0061 
percent nine hours after the crash the legal maritime limit for 
operating a vessel is 004 percent 
state environmental officials facing a deadline ordered by 
president bushs personal emissary to the oil spill worked to 
decide whether to accept exxons plan to remove the crude from 
hundreds of miles of shoreline 
key state scientists and the head of alaskas department of 
environmental conservation have sharply criticized the oil 
companys proposal which would leave nearly 200 miles of oily 
coastline uncleansed and require exemptions from strict 
environmental laws to dispose of the sludge and wastewater 
lamoreaux described the plan wednesday as more like a briefing 
document for the press than a plan for us 
dennis kelso alaskas environmental conservation commissioner 
called exxons cleanup and disposal plan a few pages of wishful 
thinking 
a statement issued by kelsos office said state authorities 
would insist that exxon focus all its energies and equipment on 
cleaning all the affected beaches no matter how hard hit 
admiral paul a yost jr commandant of the coast guard ordered 
state authorities to issue a formal response to exxons plan yost 
must approve the proposal before it is put into effect and said he 
would do so within a week 
yost also has criticized the proposal saying it was poorly 
drafted and lacked specifics but he stopped short of formally 
rejecting it 
in an interview wednesday on cbs this morning gov steve 
cowper said the state may be willing to waive some environmental 
restrictions for disposal of the oil if thats the only practical 
way to get rid of it and it doesnt really cause anything but 
temporary changes in the air quality we might well consider that 
exxon has proposed several methods to dispose of oil wastes 
salvageable oil would be processed and refined oillaced water 
would be sent to a valdez watertreatment plant that cleans ballast 
water from oil tankers solid oil wastes would be burned or buried

the central park beating and rape of a 
28yearold investment banker grabbed headlines two weeks ago and 
hasnt let go provoking debates about how racism sexism and class 
division may have led to the attack and influenced the coverage 
from harlem where the teenage suspects lived to wall street 
where the victim worked the questions continue 
did the black and hispanic youths attack her because she is 
white is the story played up because of the blackwhite angle 
would the rape of a black investment banker get the same attention 
the only reason for all this publicity is because shes 
white said a black girl from an east harlem junior high that two 
of the suspects attended if she was a black girl or a hispanic 
girl nobody would care and that happens all the time 
i dont think the incident itself was racial said the rev 
herbert daughtry a civil rights activist but i think the way 
that we the media the police all of us have reacted is 
racial 
whether racism motivated the attackers is something that may not 
be known until the trials of the six indicted youths if then 
we have never classified it as a bias case or a racially 
motivated incident said colleen roche a spokeswoman for the 
district attorneys office 
meanwhile the victim has emerged from her twoweek coma spoken 
to relatives and expressed a desire to resume running doctors said 
wednesday 
the woman began responding tuesday and had spoken in a whisper 
to relatives and staff members raised two fingers when asked to do 
so and was able to read large signs printed with yes no and her 
name said robert s kurtz assistant chief of surgery at 
metropolitan hospital and kent duffy chief of neurosurgery 
however kurtz said we would still say she is in a 
delirium people in this stage will fluctuate he has said it is 
unlikely she will ever fully recover 
the teenagers who went wilding through the park april 19 
attacked nine white and hispanic joggers bicyclists and one 
homeless man what turned the spree of petty crime into brutal 
violence remains a mystery though many have theories 
lisa whitten a black psychologist said crossing that line was 
made easier because violence is commonplace in harlem and made 
mundane by repetitive violent images in the media 
the generally degrading image of women in movies television and 
pornography she said serves as an anesthetic that would deaden 
the sense of revulsion most people would feel toward such violence 
they had fantasies in their minds of being like those on 
television the ones who shoot people who are powerful in 
control macho aggressive strong she said 
also contributing some say is the contrast between the poorer 
sections of manhattan and the wealthier ones which coexist nearly 
sidebyside along the upper reaches of central park 
from where these kids live in five minutes walking youre in 
the gold coast people are millionaires said howard diller a 
lawyer for one of the suspects was there any resentment 
jealousy hate anger that was involved 
manhattan borough president david dinkins a black who is 
running for mayor met with more than 100 community religious and 
political leaders friday to deal with lingering tensions 
i want to avoid a situation wherein any young 
africanamerican any young latino will be seen as threatening by 
others who happen to be white dinkins said 
dinkins called the attackers urban terrorists but noted 
africanamerican women who have been savaged did not get the 
attention that this has 
diller who has discussed the case on national television and 
radio programs said the victims very upwardly mobile career 
gives the story added interest for those who might otherwise ignore 
a rape 
wcbstv assistant news director steve paulus said he believed 
the crime initially drew attention because it occurred in central 
park where people are warned not to go after dark 
the morning we came in we didnt know the victim was an 
investment banker he said we didnt know she was a yuppie 
donald forst new york editor of new york newsday said there 
were newsroom discussions about the amount of attention given the 
attack but he believed it was appropriate to the event 
wnbctv news director terry baker said he thought if you keep 
all the other circumstances the same and change the race of the 
victim the coverage would have been pretty much the same 
yes there are assaults all the time rapes all the time but 
something with this degree of viciousness involving this many 
young kids allegedly it leads you to wonder whats happening to 
your society he said 
its the kind of story that has an entire city talking said 
daily news managing editor james willse the conflict is one of 
culture class more than it is of race 
john darnton metropolitan editor of the new york times was out 
of the office wednesday and a spokeswoman did not return two phone 
messages 
new york post editor jane amsterdam and metropolitan editor dick 
belsky also were not immediately available 
on monday there was a gathering in the park at which children 
tried to do some repair work on their image 
the media builds it up that all black and hispanic kids commit 
these horrible crimes said 12yearold william flores we know 
we are not like this thank you

pravda reported wednesday that police arrested 
about half of a mob of about 200 young people who attacked stores 
restaurants and parks in the republic of turkmenia in central asia 
after may day celebrations 
the communist party newspaper charged that the crowd in 
ashkabad the capital of turkmenia was led by criminals and said 
it was broken up by force on monday evening after ignoring calls by 
police to disperse 
not less than 100 lawbreakers were detained and no one was 
hurt pravda said 
the newspaper said those who were detained said they acted 
because of exorbitant prices of cooperatives and the low quality of 
products and services but as a method of protest as was seen 
they chose hooliganism 
it said the rioters broke windows and damaged cars 
pravda quoted interior minister vasily grinin of turkmenia as 
saying police managed to break up the rampage without using tear 
gas or truncheons 
this apparently was intended to assure readers that no repeat 
had occurred of the clash between soldiers and proindependence 
demonstrators in the georgian republic on april 9 nineteen people 
were killed then and a 20th victim was fatally shot later for 
violating a curfew 
turkmenia is a southern soviet republic of 35 million people 
that borders the caspian sea iran and afghanistan it was the 
first such report of trouble in turkmenia but religious and civil 
unrest were reported previously in the other traditionally moslem 
central asian republics of uzbekistan and kazakhstan 
cooperatives are small privately owned businesses allowed under 
president mikhail s gorbachevs economic reforms to provide goods 
and services the staterun economy cannot many soviets view the 
cooperatives with suspicion

spending on education is up but progress is at 
a standstill education secretary lauro cavazos said wednesday in 
releasing a report card that rates the nations students as 
merely average 
the good news is that the schools are not worse the bad news 
is that we are not making progress cavazos said as he stood 
before his departments sixth annual state education performance 
chart 
we are standing still and the problem is that its been this 
way for three years in a row frankly the situation scares me 
he said 
the figures show a decline this year in the national high school 
graduation rate and falling scores on college entrance exams in 
half the states 
in reaction the council of chief state school officers while 
acknowledging that the task ahead is gigantic noted that 44 of 
the 50 states have made college entrance test gains since 1982 and 
38 states have improved their high school completion rates since 
then 
but cavazos called the longerterm gains minimal he said 
scores on college entrance exams are still substantially lower 
than they were in the 1960s while the graduation rate has gone up 
less than two points 
as a nation our educational performance is merely average 
cavazos said people are still willing apparently to accept 
that were not doing well and cant compete 
if educational progress has stagnated the education 
departments chart shows the same cannot be said of perpupil 
spending the national average was 3977 per student in 1987 up 
from 3165 in 1982 calculated in constant dollars a 26 percent 
hike 
we are already spending more money per student than our major 
foreign competitors japan and germany and yet our students 
consistently fall behind the competition in competitive testing 
cavazos said money alone is not the answer to our education 
deficit 
cavazos said he would write to state school chiefs governors 
and school board presidents and urge them to adopt specific goals 
such as boosting high school graduation rates to 90 percent and 
cutting in half the number of children who fail a grade he said 
states and districts should issue annual reports on their progress 
toward such goals 
specifically the departments chart shows that national scores 
on the scholastic aptitude test sat fell from an average of 906 
to 904 on a scale of 400 to 1600 from 1987 to 1988 fourteen of 
the 22 states in which the sat is the dominant college entrance 
exam registered declines 
scores on the american college testing program act marked on 
a scale of 1 to 36 showed a scant 01point gain and 11 of the 28 
states in which the act dominates posted decreases 
the high school graduation rate rose from 695 percent in 1982 
to 717 percent in 1985 but it edged down in 1986 to 716 percent 
and dropped to 711 percent in 1987 the latest year for which such 
statistics could be calculated 
department officials noted several encouraging trends minority 
students are continuing to lift their test scores close a high 
school graduation gap and in increasing numbers take the 
advanced placement test that qualifies students for college credit 
in addition states with relatively high poverty rates such as 
alabama mississippi and south carolina have registered some of the 
largest increases in college entrance test scores since 1982 
though they still rank at the bottom of the heap 
cavazos generally dismal assessment comes amid a spate of 
reform efforts in the past few years asked if the reform movement 
has failed he replied that some of it has lost its momentum or 
failed to achieve its goals 
he said fundamental restructuring which he defined as parental 
freedom to choose public schools provision of alternate ways to 
become a teacher and more parental involvement in education has 
yet to occur we have some examples but we dont have a lot of 
them out there he said 
in a telephone interview california schools superintendent bill 
honig accused cavazos of misrepresenting data ignoring progress 
and flinging cold water on educators who have been able to improve 
their students performance 
weve got statistics showing that achievement test scores are 
going up substantially in the country honig said calling them a 
better indicator than college entrance tests because they include 
average students as well as the collegebound 
honig also said sat scores are flat because so many more 
students are taking the test he said there has actually been a 
substantial improvement in the percentage of seniors scoring higher 
than 450 on the verbal section and 500 on the math section a 20 
percent increase since 1982 
the national education association issued a statement saying it 
agreed that us schools are stagnating but the teacher union said 
cavazos is wrong to minimize money as a factor for improvement and 
it attributed the stagnation problem to federal cutbacks in 
programs for the disadvantaged what we are seeing now is the 
direct result of the educational neglect supported by the reagan 
administration said nea president mary futrell

locking them into a searing foundry ladle was a mentally ill 
religious zealot who spoke of trial by fire his attorney said 
wednesday 
bartley james dobbens 28 is on trial in circuit court on two 
counts of murder in the thanksgiving day 1987 deaths of 2yearold 
bartley joel and 15monthold peter david dobben in nearby norton 
shores 
the defendant who has been diagnosed as a paranoid 
schizophrenic wept during opening arguments when his wife and 
children were mentioned 
dobbens pregnant wife was waiting for him in their car when he 
took the boys into the cannonmuskegon corp foundry to retrieve a 
bible and show them where he worked 
in his opening argument defense attorney terry nolan told 
jurors he would show dobben was legally insane at the time 
assistant muskegon county prosecutor brett gardner said the 
evidence would show dobben planned his childrens deaths because of 
jealousy and a bad marriage that existed from the start 
nolan said dobben stopped taking psychiatric medication and 
filed for divorce within two weeks of meeting selfordained 
minister rood vaughan in march 1987 
within two weeks bartley dobbens life turned upside down 
the attorney said 
dobben began taking his children to hear fundamentalist 
christian sermons by vaughan in the basement of vaughans home and 
sometimes kept the children out all night nolan said 
on the day of the slaying dobben visited a friend at 1 am and 
talked for hours quoting from the bible and speaking of trial by 
fire and only fire burns sins away nolan said 
dobben thought he was performing a spiritual rite when he 
took his children to the foundry put them in a furnace played 
with them to make them comfortable lit the gas jets and set 
them at 1300 degrees nolan said 
the attorney said dobbens schizophrenia first appeared in high 
school when he appeared to undergo a jekyll and hyde 
transition and became obsessed with religion 
after marrying dobben became insanely jealous and later became 
obsessed with the idea his children would be killed nolan said 
in 1985 dobben had psychotic episodes so intense he was 
committed to a psychiatric hospital and endured coworkers taunts 
after his release nolan said 
nolan is charged with open counts of murder meaning the jury 
sets the degree if convicted he could be sentenced to life in 
prison

the rightwing military government said 
wednesday it was scrapping plans for democratic reforms because the 
opposition rejected a takeitorleaveit proposal 
interior minister carlos caceres blamed intransigent 
opposition leaders in announcing an end to further talks he said 
the opposition closed out the possibility of a realistic 
agreement on amendments to the 1980 constitution 
under the current circumstances there is no possibility 
whatsoever of talking again about constitutional changes he told 
a news conference 
among reform proposals abandoned was one legalizing marxism 
the announcement indicated an abrupt hardening in the position 
of president augusto pinochets government and a return to an 
openly antagonistic relationship between authorities and opposition 
patricio aylwin president of the centrist christian democratic 
party and a leader of a 17party opposition coalition told his own 
news conference later that the move means reforms will have to wait 
until after dec 14 elections 
if the government has said it will make no changes at all 
there will be no changes for the time being he said they will 
have to be done by the future congress and the future government to 
be elected in december 
aylwin is considered the coalitions most likely choice as 
presidential candidate 
the government on friday proposed 19 changes to the 
constitution including several offered in response to pressures 
for reform after gen pinochet lost a referendum last october on 
extending his rule to 1997 some changes deemed essential by the 
opposition were left out however 
the referendum loss obliged pinochet to schedule the elections 
and his foes say reforms are needed to make sure the new government 
has full democratic powers pinochet is legally barred from being a 
candidate 
the government package would have required approval by two 
successive senates before the reforms took effect a delay of at 
least five years 
the opposition coalition rejected it on tuesday night as a 
step backward it wanted the reforms to take effect before the 
elections the first since pinochet seized power in a violent 1973 
coup 
the government proposal met an opposition call for amending a 
constitutional article that outlaws all propagation of marxist 
thought by individuals or groups it would retain a ban on 
political groups that promote violence or totalitarianism 
it also allowed for a onetime shortening of the presidential 
term to four years instead of the normal eight years the 
opposition wanted the shorter term for the next government which 
it sees as a transition leadership 
but the government refused to meet an opposition demand that the 
entire senate be elected according to the constitution 10 members 
of the senates 36 members will be appointed 
it also rejected opposition calls for erasing a clause that 
allows pinochet to remain as army commander for eight more years 
the same clause applies to the heads of the navy air force and 
national police 
the 73yearold pinochet recently vowed to stay on as army 
commander and said the military would keep a role as political 
overseers to ensure the country does not fall under leftist control

newly elected parliament members from moscow 
decided wednesday it would be frivolous to nominate anyone but 
mikhail s gorbachev for president of the soviet union a 
participant in the meeting said 
we decided the president must be gorbachev and we will not put 
forward an alternative said mikhail bocharov who was elected 
from the butovo district on moscows outskirts 
leonid kravchenko director of the official news agency tass 
said last week in london the moscow deputies planned to nominate a 
candidate to compete with gorbachev for the presidenccy but 
bocharov said it was a silly idea 
gorbachev who has been communist party chief since march 1985 
was elected president unanimously in october by the supreme soviet 
replacing andrei a gromyko 
political reforms since then change the way the president is 
chosen and expand the powers of the office the new 2250member 
congress of peoples deputies will convene may 25 to elect the 
president and choose a 542member working parliament from among its 
own members 
tass said gorbachev addressed wednesdays meeting of moscow 
members but it did not report what he said bocharov said the 
soviet leader answered questions put by some of the 70 to 80 
representatives present 
others attending included lev n zaikov the moscow party chief 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov and party ideologist vadim a medvedev 
tass reported 
bocharov who runs a building materials factory said the moscow 
group would meet again may 15 to chose candidates for the working 
parliament 
in another political development soviet political activists 
said they had formed a branch of the romebased radical party 
alexander rubchenko spokesman for the newly formed 70member 
transnational radical party said the group would campaign for the 
elimination of nuclear weapons more political freedom and 
protection of the environment 
rubchenko a political activist said the new group also was 
seeking more economic ties with western europe the lifting of 
customs barriers and acceptance of a common european system of laws 
soviet law prohibits any political party except the communist 
party and the effort to register as an affiliate of the italian 
party apparently was designed to get around that prohibition

more than 100000 opposition backers 
packed one of the capitals main streets wednesday to hear 
candidates predict victory in next weeks elections and an end to 
21 years of military control 
presidential candidate guillermo endara his voice hoarse told 
the crowd panama was on the eve of a new republic of which you 
all will be founding fathers 
i was born free i am not free i will be free on may 7 
shouted guillermo ford the oppositions candidate for the second 
of two vicepresidential seats in sundays balloting 
the speeches were interrupted when crowds panicked once when 
security guards stopped people from coming too near the candidates 
and again when an alleged government infiltrator or toad was 
chased from the area by a mob beating him with sticks people in 
the crowd said they saw an unidentified man fire gunshots into the 
air at one point 
several people were knocked to the ground some fainted and were 
carried away but no serious injuries were reported 
a group of youths snakedanced through the crowd carrying a 
black coffin with the picture of a smiling gen manuel antonio 
noriega pasted on the front and a pineapple affixed on top 
pineapple face is a derogatory name for noriega inspired by 
his rough complexion 
first vicepresidential candidate ricardo arias calderon praised 
young panamanians at the rally saying there are thousands here 
who have never known liberty but are here to fight for it 
the chanting flagwaving crowd was packed so tightly on via 
espana that at times it was impossible to move 
the opposition has accused the government of trying to rig 
sundays election earlier wednesday opposition leaders warned 
that panamanians may react with violence if fraud is evident 
this is the last peaceful opportunity for change ford told 
a news conference earlier in the day endara and arias also 
attended the conference 
ford said the opposition wants to avoid a confrontation with the 
defense forces but we fear that if the will of the people is 
violated there will be a spontaneous reaction 
noriega head of the defense forces and panamas de facto ruler 
is backing his business associate carlos duque jaen for president 
the government also has warned that the elections could turn 
violent duque has urged his followers to take to the streets 
to defend the vote 
the government made a public show of handing out weapons april 
30 to the dignity batallions civilians trained to defend 
panama against a us invasion 
arias said official voter rolls show duplicated names and 
suspicious increases in the number of voters he said the 
registration in some districts doubled 
he alleged the number of registered voters on rolls has grown 29 
percent since 1984 while the population has increased by only 16 
percent 
government officials explained the increases by saying 
registration procedures have improved 
despite the predictions of fraud arias said he was confident 
the oppositions margin of victory will be such that it will 
neutralize the fraud if the fraud is not accompanied by crude 
forms of repression 
the opposition candidates said there is no hope of democracy in 
panama as long as noriega who was indicted in the united states 
last year on charges of drug smuggling and money laundering 
remains in power 
after his indictment thenpresident eric arturo delvalle tried 
to oust noriega noriega in turn ousted delvalle 
noriega and the government accuse the opposition of being 
lackies of the united states which has imposed economic sanctions 
on panama as part of its attempt to drive him from power 
noriega denies the drug smuggling and money laundering 
allegations and says the united states is trying to get rid of him 
as part of a plan to retain control of the panama canal 
according to a 1977 treaty the united states is to turn the 
waterway over to local control in the year 2000 and remove its 
12000 military personnel from panama 
among the observers expected for sundays voting are former 
presidents jimmy carter who signed the treaty and gerald ford 
they are part of an unofficial us delegation invited by the 
panamanian government the government has rejected any official 
us delegation

a red wolf the second rarest mammal in 
the united states gave birth to three puppies wednesday at a 
wildlife center 
if the puppies survive they will be the first texasborn red 
wolves since the mid1970s raising the total population to 92 
said officials at fossil rim wildlife center 
in 1973 after the passage of the endangered species act the 
entire red wolf population in southeast texas and louisiana was 
captured to prevent its extinction 
the us fish and wildlife service captured about 40 red wolves 
and began a recovery program in washington state 
the blackfooted ferret is the only mammal that is rarer than 
the red wolf in the united states 
fossil rim a research and education center that is involved in 
the propagation of eight endangered species received four red wolf 
breeding pair in february 
we are sure a second female will produce a litter within the 
next week to 10 days said dr evan blumer a fossil rim 
veterinarian 
the puppies were estimated to weigh about 14 ounces but fossil 
rim officials said they would not be sexed or examined until 
thursday or friday 
the red wolf is smaller than the grey wolf with females 
weighing 4060 pounds and males weighing 6080 pounds 
the wolf ranged from texas east to the atlantic coast and north 
to the ohio valley but began disappearing because of their 
inability to adapt to changes in the land and predator control

warring factions agreed wednesday to 
implement a ceasefire plan to end the beirut bloodbath that has 
killed 278 people in eight weeks an arab league peacemaker 
announced 
there is no justification for a single shot to be fired in 
lebanon as of now algerian diplomat lakhdar ibrahimi told 
reporters after meeting separately with lebanons rival cabinet 
leaders sunni moslem salim hoss and christian gen michel aoun 
several hours after ibrahimis announcement however police 
reported a new violation of the truce 
as speedboats began ferrying passengers from the harbor of the 
christian port of jounieh to the cypriotflagged ferry baroness m 
anchored 15 miles off the coast three shells fired from 
syrianpoliced west beirut crashed on the byblos coast nine miles 
north of jounieh police said 
they said the captain of the baroness m refused to enter the 
port 12 miles north of beirut because he was skeptical about 
guarantees that his vessel would not be shelled 
a police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
according to regulations said the violation did not interrupt the 
transport of about 500 passengers onto the baroness m to be ferried 
to the cypriot port of larnaca 
the ship and another boat the larnaca rose had evacuated about 
15000 people from the christian enclave during the fighting but 
both suspended the shuttles april 24 after they became the target 
of syrian and druse moslem gunners 
earlier police reported some sniper fire from moslem west 
beirut into the christian sector but a spokesman played down the 
violation and said it seems the ceasefire orders havent been 
issued yet no casualties were reported 
aouns 20000 lebanese army soldiers have battled moslem 
militiamen and allied syrian soldiers since march 3 more than 
1000 people have been injured in that time 
ibrahimi and kuwaits ambassador to syria abdelaziz jassem 
arrived in beirut earlier wednesday seeking to enforce an arab 
leaguebrokered truce that began april 28 
it scaled down indiscriminate bombardment of population centers 
in and around beirut but it was violated repeatedly after three 
days because aoun rejected the second clause of the accord 
refusing to lift a blockade of three illegal militiarun ports 
the blockade through which aoun wanted to restore government 
authority and gather taxes worth 100 million a year ignited the 
latest fighting 
druse and syrian gunners who outnumber christian forces by 31 
retaliated by firing at christian ports then besieged the 
christian heartland and trapped some 1 million christians in a 
310squaremile enclave 
ibrahimi said aoun now has accepted to implement the decision 
adopted by the arab foreign ministers which calls for lifting all 
blockades imposed on all air and sea ports 
beirut airport the countrys only international air transport 
facility was closed by christian shellfire march 12 
ibrahimi said aoun also agreed to reopen road crossings that 
link beiruts moslem and christian sectors for three months while 
the arab league brokers a comprehensive settlement 
i can say the ceasefire has taken effect today after the 
settlement of the ports dispute the observer force will begin 
arriving soon ibrahimi said but did not give a date 
an aide to hoss said ibrahimi proposed deploying arab observers 
at the disputed ports where aoun has charged militias also run 
guns and drugs aoun agreed to the envoys compromise 
kuwaiti foreign minister sheik sabah ahmed who heads the arab 
league panel on lebanon stressed wednesday that the observers will 
be sent only after the ceasefire is consolidated 
we are not prepared to sacrifice any arab brethren in the 
continued shelling and exchange of fire he told the kuwait news 
agency 
aoun has welcomed the deployment of an arab observer team 
saying it also would monitor the 40000 syrian soldiers in lebanon 
whom christians accuse of breaking a 1976 arab league peacekeeping 
mandate by siding with the moslems 
the observers presence is expected to loosen syrias grip as 
lebanons sole powerbroker

an african rebel leader urged the united 
states on wednesday to help end the protracted war between the 
strategically placed province of eritrea and the sovietbacked 
government of ethiopia 
isaias afwerki secretary general of the eritrean peoples 
liberation front said he hoped to convey his views to us 
officials and lawmakers although he declined to say whom he would 
be meeting 
state department officials who said afwerki is the most senior 
eritrean rebel leader ever to visit here also declined to say 
whether they would meet with him 
afwerki said he did not have any specific initiatives to offer 
but hoped the united states would contribute to a lasting 
solution for the conflict by helping bring the sides to the 
negotiating table 
us policy rejects eritreas demands for secession from 
ethiopia advocating negotiations between the sides to end what has 
become at 27 years africas longest war 
state department officials have occasionally met with members of 
the eplf the largest of several eritrean groups the us also 
maintains ties with the government of ethiopian military chairman 
mengistu haile mariam although relations have deteriorated since 
ethiopia switched allegiance to the soviet union in 1977 
afwerkis visit comes at a time when mengistu suffering 
economic woes and military defeats to the rebels is also making 
overtures to the us administration 
ethiopias prospects are bleaker than ever afwerki 
contended at a seminar sponsored by the center for strategic and 
international studies an independent think tank the eplf which 
is backed by several arab governments but relies mostly on captured 
soviet weaponry has claimed significant military victories over 
the past year 
us officials believe the organization controls about 75 
percent of eritrea which overlooks a key water route to the oil 
fields of saudi arabia but that the government retains control of 
the provinces major ports and cities officials here say the 
government is also under pressure from its main arms supplier the 
soviet union to end the costly war 
afwerki said the soviet union despite claims to the contrary 
continues to arm the ethiopian government 
nonetheless the eplf is among the first who hope to benefit 
from recent cooperation between the us and the soviet union in 
resolving regional conflicts around the world afwerki said such 
superpower cooperation as evidenced by agreements ending the 
soviet occupation of afghanistan and the cuban occupation of 
angola has made his organization optimistic about prospects for 
negotiations with ethiopia 
the eplf is still holding out for its 1980 proposal to conduct a 
referendum that would determine whether eritrea remains an 
autonomous part of ethiopia or secedes from it altogether he said 
the eplf has in the past proposed thirdcountry mediation to end 
the war with ethiopia but has spurned proposals for italy or sudan 
to bring the sides together 
afwerki rejected claims that his group is marxist in nature 
calling that a pretext for past us indifference and said the 
eplf represented varying economic views and was committed to a free 
economy

a senator and a house representative waged 
verbal war wednesday over whether a member of congress is smart 
enough to match wits with the soviet military 
in the first volley sen james exon dneb criticized a 
decision by the house armed services committee to hold hearings 
with soviet officials on crafting a us defense budget 
if the congress cant make decisions on national security 
without testimony and advice from soviet military planners then we 
are in more peril than i had envisioned to use an old wisdom we 
have indeed met the enemy and it is us said exon a member of 
the senate armed services committee 
shooting back was rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house 
panel who said exon apparently doesnt believe senators can 
handle a public givenandtake with soviet officials 
im fully confident in the intellectual and political skills 
of the members of my committee he said 
aspin announced monday that his panel would hold hearings with 
marshal sergey akhromeyev former chief of the soviet general staff 
and now an adviser to kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev sometime in 
june 
in addition the committees defense policy panel will hold a 
hearing may 9 with soviet officials from the institute for the usa 
and canada a moscow think tank on superpower relations 
aspin said putting together a defense budget will be hard 
enough to do given the deficit but the problem is compounded by 
uncertainty about the soviet union 
the chairman pointed out that only the executive branch can 
negotiate agreements with the soviets but a committee is in a 
better position for expansive givenandtake and exploration of new 
ideas 
that raised the ire of exon who wondered why congress doesnt 
invite libyan leader moammar gadhafi to give us expert testimony 
on stopping terrorism 
gorbymania has struck with a vengenance in the halls of 
congress we have initiated our own phrase to mimic the soviets 
parrotstroika exon said 
the nebraska senator also said congress should not be a forum 
for soviet propaganda 
in response aspin said that if exon fears that hearing what 
the russians have to say and putting them through a grilling on 
what they havent talked about publicly amounts to making the 
committee process a forum for soviet propaganda i feel sorry for 
him 
exon in a telephone interview late wednesday said he didnt 
need help from soviet military planners les believes the soviets 
are here to be grilled i expect him to be keenly disappointed 
asked if the criticisms would result in any bad feelings exon 
said no les and i are good friends weve worked together for a 
long time this is not the first time and it wont be the last

sheik abbas ben sheik el hocine rector of the 
great mosque of paris and considered the top moslem religious 
authority in france died wednesday night after suffering a heart 
attack officials said he was 77 
abbas was evacuated by helicopter wednesday evening from the 
hotel crillon where visiting plo chief yasser arafat is staying 
to the val de grace military hospital after the heart attack 
a statement issued by the mosque said abbas died at 1030 pm 
shortly after being admitted to the hospital 
it said the rectors body would be returned to his homeland 
algeria on friday 
abbas was made rector of the paris mosque in 1982 he often 
acted as a spokesman for french moslems a role disputed by some 
and as a liaison between the french government and the moslem 
community 
as many as 3 million moslems live in france making it the 
nations second religion after roman catholicism 
it was not immediately known whether abbas had met with arafat 
at the crillon the palestine liberation organization chairman was 
attending a dinner given by premier michel rocard at the close of a 
twoday official visit 
abbas with his tinted spectacles and astrakhan hat was a 
wellknown figure to the french media appearing in occasional 
television interviews and commenting on political developments 
affecting the moslem community 
he became for many a soothing and fatherly symbol of a moderate 
islam at the height of the scandal of salman rushdies the 
satanic verses abbas advised the french not to pay so much 
attention to this disrespectful writer 
iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini issued a death 
sentence on rushdie saying he had blasphemed islam in his book 
abbas neither spoke nor understood french when he succeeded si 
hamza boubakeur who for years was a powerful but controversial 
figure at the head of the mosque in the latin quarter on the left 
bank 
from a notable religious family near constantine algeria abbas 
was educated in north african centers of islamic learning such as 
kerouan tunisia and fez morocco 
he worked for religious reform in french colonial algeria to 
help return the north african land to its arab and islamic 
character following algerian independence he spent four years as 
president of the supreme islamic council 
as rector of the paris mosque his human qualities soon won him 
respect from algerian moslems who make up the largest part of the 
french moslem community he took to opening the doors of the mosque 
in winter to provide shelter for the homeless 
the mosque inaugurated in 1926 is the largest place of moslem 
worship in western europe

a year after fire gutted 4 floors of the 
62story first interstate bank tower and killed a worker 
prosecutors filed 12 misdemeanor charges against nine companies 
wednesday in connection with the blaze 
two counts of the complaint filed by the district attorney and 
city attorney referred to the death of alexander handy 24 a 
maintenance man who died may 4 1988 after riding an elevator to 
the 12th floor where the fire started to investigate an alarm 
forty other people suffered smoke inhalation in the citys worst 
highrise fire which caused more than 450 million in damage 
deputy district attorney david guthman said there is a 
threeyear statute of limitations on filing felony charges the 
decision to file misdemeanor charges he said was prompted by the 
misdemeanor statute of limitations which runs out friday 
if convicted the defendants face various fines ranging from 
1000 on municipal violations to 10000 on state labor code 
violations 
among those charged in the complaint were first interstate bank 
of california and pedus security services which was in charge of 
security 
the corporations charged in the misdemeanor complaint included 
those owning part of the building or those involved in its security 
and maintenance 
the charges alleged seven violations of the state labor code and 
five of the los angeles municipal code including blocking a fire 
exit failing to maintain fire equipment and failing to maintain an 
accident protection program the charges also allege failure to 
call in an alarm and failure to notify the fire department of 
inoperative equipment 
others charged with violations were equitable life assurance 
society of the united states united california bank realty corp 
cosco fire protection inc commercial building maintenance co 
american building maintenance first interstate bank ltd and 
first interstate bancorp 
cosco was installing fire sprinklers at the time of the fire 
and was charged in connection with the closing of water mains in 
the building 
during the blaze a ring of flame roiled around the 12th through 
15th floors for nearly four hours showering streets with glass and 
flaming debris and chasing people to the roof where 10 were plucked 
to safety by helicopters 
others fled down smoky stairwells thirtyseven maintenance 
workers and three firemen were treated for smoke inhalation 
the cause of the conflagration was never determined because the 
2000degree fire destroyed clues but investigators eliminated 
arson as a possibility 
the 859foottall building had no sprinkler system because it 
was built in 1973 a year before fire codes were modified to 
require sprinklers the 62story tower was the tallest in the city 
at the time of the fire

transfusion at least three other people have died from the same 
blood said murphys attorney terry oreilly of menlo park

of massachusetts graduate research center after an afternoon rally 
at the student union about half that number pushed aside three 
campus police officers trying to block the entrance to the 2story 
annex to the graduate research towers 
we didnt think wed be able to get into that building said 
organizer jonathan leavitt a 22yearold junior at the 
25000student campus we thought they would be smart enough to 
see the potential target and they werent 
police closed the building to all but faculty members who work 
there and locked a corridor holding the protesters to keep them 
from taking over more offices officers guarded other buildings 
as the takeover continued late wednesday university 
administrators agreed to make public all documents relating to the 
research and said a panel of students faculty and administrators 
would be formed to discuss its future the announcement followed a 
meeting of students faculty and administrators 
the two previous takeovers of other campus buildings resulted in 
68 arrests 
the berkeley walkout by over union recognition came with just 
two weeks to go before final examinations 
hey hey ho ho union bustings got to go signcarrying 
teaching and research assistants chanted as they demonstrated at 
every major entrance to the campus 
their union the association for graduate student employees is 
affiliated with the united auto workers the students say they are 
underpaid overworked and often forced to go without health and 
other benefits 
about 90 percent ot the 3200 graduate assistants took part in 
the walkout the association claimed there are about 9000 
graduate students at berkeley 
according to a selective survey by the association of 307 
classes through wednesday afternoon 66 percent were canceled 25 
percent were less than halffull and 9 percent were at capacity 
university spokesman tom debley said the results were not 
necessarily representative of the campus which has 23000 
undergraduates 
in new york students released a list of demands that included 
no staff or faculty layoffs in the city university of new york 
more social services for students and amnesty for protesters 
we will not relinquish the buildings at this particular time 
because governor cuomo has not met all of our demands abdallah 
muhammad a student at new york city technical college in brooklyn 
said at a news conference at city college one of our major 
demands is to meet with cuomo 
cuomo reiterated he would not meet with students while sitins 
continued ill talk to them when theyre legal he said in 
rochester if theres anything that education should start with 
the first rule is you live by the law

an overwhelming majority of engineers and 
technicians who work for capital citiesabc voted wednesday to 
reject what the network called its final contract offer union 
officials said 
the company said it would meet with leaders of the national 
association for broadcast employees and technicians but only to 
reiterate its position 
we want to meet with the union as soon as possible to make 
sure the leadership and its members understand that the terms of 
our final offer will not be renegotiated said company 
spokeswoman patricia matson 
the unions chief negotiator thomas f kennedy said he would 
meet with company officials and expressed optimism they would 
negotiate further 
thats what the collective bargaining process is all about 
kennedy said were not in a strikevote situation yet 
a dozen of nabets 18 bargaining units voted to reject the 
companys proposal said union spokesman john krieger wlsam radio 
news writers who are considered part of a 19th unit also rejected 
the offer 
all units must ratify a contract before it can take effect 
krieger said 
ms matson said the company felt sad and dismayed about the 
rejection 
the number of workers represented is disputed krieger said 
there are 2477 workers while abc says there are 2150 the union 
did not release the vote tally 
union negotiators had recommended rejection of the offer which 
was made after a month of negotiations that ended march 31 
about 85 percent of the workers are engineers who handle 
cameras lights and audio equipment and other technical tasks the 
union also represents news writers mail messengers receptionists 
wardrobe specialists and others 
the average engineer makes 47000 in base pay krieger said 
abc said that with overtime the average engineer earns about 
70000 
the rejected contract would have provided a onetime 10 percent 
ratification bonus if approved by may 15 in lieu of a raise in the 
first year the bonus drops to 3 percent if the contract is 
ratified after may 15 
the rejected pact also would have provided 3 percent wage 
increases in the second and third years and a 5 percent lump sum 
bonus in the fourth year 
the offer also included a virtual guarantee that none of the 
about 2000 fulltime television employees would be laid off in the 
contracts first three years 
capital citiesabc said the offer would mean the layoffs of 60 
or 70 radio engineers soon after ratification the union put the 
figure closer to 125 
nabet last struck abc for 20 weeks in 1977 and for nine weeks in 
1967 the union struck nbc in 1987 for 17 weeks

president bush is getting everything he wanted 
and more from the house banking committee to prevent sampls from 
tapping the taxpayers for another bailout but only in exchange for 
new lowincome housing initiatives 
on a 492 vote just before midnight tuesday the committee 
approved bushs 90 billion savings and loan plan the largest 
financial bailout in the nations history after spending four 
days toughening capital standards on the industry and adding a pair 
of housing components 
only reps joseph kennedy dmass and jim leach riowa voted 
no kennedy said the bill did not have enough housing support for 
the poor and complained about the panels rejection of his 
provisions attacking lending discrimination leach said he wanted 
still tougher capital standards 
as it now stands the house bill would require the nations 
3000 thrifts to put up at least 20 billion in new capital over 
the next five years twice as much as a version approved by the 
senate two weeks ago to fulfill bushs promise of never again

chemical contamination and comply with new environmental protection 
agency standards 
the epa on tuesday proposed federally required ceilings on the

pollutants allowed in drinking water 
michael cook director of the epa office which deals with 
drinking water contaminants said most public water systems already 
meet the proposed requirements but additional purification 
equipment will probably be needed in about 2500 public systems 
serving about 2 million people mostly in rural areas 
in some cases households will be paying higher water bills 
anywhere from 10 to 460 more a year as a result officials 
said although the new requirements in many cases are unlikely to

percent pay raise 
calling inadequate salaries the most serious threat to the 
future of the judiciary rehnquist sought support for legislation 
providing the raise and regular costofliving adjustments 
this is not in my view fairly termed a pay raise 
rehnquist said in a prepared statement to the house post office and 
civil service committee this is instead a partial recapture of 
the tremendous decline in purchasing power that has affected 
judicial salaries over the last 20 years 
a 30 percent pay increase would boost the chief justices annual 
salary from 115000 to 149500 salaries of supreme court 
justices would rise from 110000 to 143000 appeals court judges

colleges and universities that had drawn much american criticism 
three north americans were named to a 15member international 
commission to assist in a major revision of the document 
its initial draft in 1985 had aroused keen objections from us 
catholic educators as projecting a degree of ecclesiastical control 
over colleges that would not be acceptable on the american academic 
scene 
that draft was revised but educators at their april 1825 
meeting with vatican officials called for further major revisions 
and the commission was set up to guide the process

the religious right lacking a charismatic 
leader and fresh from its success in keeping a republican in the 
white house may be in danger of being pushed out of the political 
arena by an old foe apathy 
the rev ed dobson and ed hindson who each spent more than a 
decade leading evangelicals out of the political closet as 
architects of the moral majority contend in a new book that 
religious conservatives are searching for new leadership 
i think the vast majority of fundamentalists are kind of 
in neutral said dobson once considered the successor to jerry 
falwells evangelistic empire 
with falwell announcing his withdrawal from politics and pat 
robertsons unsuccessful presidential candidacy dobson said 
there is no charismatic person to put it together 
dobson and hindson authors of the seduction of power 
preachers politics and the media discussed the emergence of the 
religious right as a political force at a recent conference 
sponsored by the center on religion amp society 
hindson said the religious rights success in electing former 
president reagan and president bush who support evangelical 
positions on abortion and family life issues may have left 
some evangelicals apathetic 
they dont see themselves threatened by the political party in 
power said hindson one poll showed more than 80 percent of 
white evangelicals supported bush he said i think the average 
fundamentalistevangelical is thinking hey eight more good 
years why worry about it 
the exception to the political inertia among religious 
conservatives is the abortion issue hindson and dobson said 
operation rescue a series of protests outside abortion clinics 
shows increased activism among younger more radical 
religious conservatives said hindson a former religion professor 
at falwells liberty university before becoming executive director 
of the center for biblical counseling and education in st louis 
for evangelicals who believe abortion involves the taking of a 
human life hindson said it is the ultimate moral issue of our 
times 
the march on washington of at least 300000 people advocating 
legalized abortion may jar more evangelicals back into the 
political arena he added i think what happened is going to 
cause or force renewed coalitions among catholics and evangelicals 
on the abortion issue 
in their book dobson and hindson say the religious right has 
had mixed success with its political agenda fending off the equal 
rights amendment and the gay rights movement but failing to bring 
about significant changes on issues such as abortion and public 
school prayers 
but dobson dismisses criticism that fundamentalists were 
exploited by the republican party he contends the religious right 
was granted legitimacy by the gop 
i would argue the religious right used the republican party as 
much as the republican party used the religious right said 
dobson a former editor of the fundamentalist journal who worked 
with falwell for 15 years before becoming the senior pastor of 
calvary church in grand rapids mich 
still the men said the new prominence fundamentalists have 
enjoyed in the media has also been a mixed blessing with the 
downfall in sex scandals of tv evangelists jim bakker and jimmy 
swaggart bringing unwanted notoriety 
when falwell tried to step in to save bakkers ptl ministry 
hindson said he became a man in a white suit stomping all over 
the barnyard 
hindson also said his old boss through such actions as labeling 
nobel peace prize winner bishop desmond tutu a phony and his 
religiously based defense of such individuals as oliver north and 
deposed philippine president ferdinand marcos provided an example 
of the dangers of stretching religious principles to defend extreme 
political views 
saying evangelicals need to keep their political involvement in 
perspective hindson told a joke about robertson that is making the 
rounds of evangelical pastors 
why would god let pat roberston run for the presidency 
one reason was to keep him out of the ministry and the other 
was to keep him out of the white house

its a tactic familiar to anyone who watches 
television crime shows the bad cop is menacing the good cop is 
calm and reassuring and theyre both out for the same thing 
by design or by accident secretary of defense dick cheney is 
cast as the bad cop in the flap over his forecast of failure for 
soviet president mikhail gorbachevs efforts to change the society 
he leads 
president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii are the 
good guys cheering on the economic and political reforms gorbachev 
has undertaken they venture no guesses on the outcome 
cheney never said he didnt want perestroika to succeed what he 
said was that he didnt like the odds and that the united states 
shouldnt make wholesale defense cuts on the assumption that the 
new look in moscow will be permanent 
thats hardly a surprising observation for the man assigned to 
steer the pentagon budget through congress nor is it a new one 
cheney speculated 10 days ago that gorbachev might eventually be 
forced to change to a more conservative course or to yield power 
and cheney is not the only skeptic in the new administration 
the course has been one of caution while policies are reviewed and 
washington tries to determine how solid the changes in moscow may 
prove to be 
looking around the world today in the developing countries 
and even in the communist bloc we see the triumph of two great 
ideas the idea of free government and the idea of free 
enterprise bush said tuesday 
but there is no sign of haste to overhaul us defense policies 
because of the changes in moscow including gorbachevs multiple 
target peace campaign in red square last monday flowers and peace 
banners supplanted the menacing missiles of past may day parades 
cheneys question is whether that can last 
even the humor shows signs of the times bush joked in a speech 
monday that the ministry of economic planning had its own unit in 
the moscow parade 200 economists marching along yelling mayday 
mayday after the laughter he added but today thats 
beginning to change 
the cheney comments that stirred all this into a weekend 
controversy were made in an april 29 interview with columnists 
rowland evans and robert novak on cable news network in it the 
defense secretary said until we know that gorbachev is for real 
and that the changes he wants to bring about are irreversible it 
would be a mistake for the united states to cut its nato forces 
then came the impolitic comment that led to the flap 
i think you have to distinguish between what hes trying to do 
and whether or not hes actually going to be able to do it and i 
think the bottom line is that if i had to guess today i would 
guess that he would ultimately fail that is to say that he will 
not be able to reform the soviet economy to turn it into an 
efficient modern society and when that happens hes likely to be 
replaced by somebody who will be far more hostile than hes been in 
terms of his attitude toward the west 
later in the interview cheney said he thinks gorbachev has set 
an impossible task by seeking fundamental reform of the soviet 
system within a relatively short time 
you have to be cautious not to perceive greater change than 
actually occurs he said weve had a brief period of time with 
a man who appears to be more of a realist and pursuing policies 
friendlier to the west we dont know whether thats a permanent 
change thats going to last or whether its a temporary aberration 
as long as theres a possibility its an aberration we have 
to be careful 
bush and his spokesmen were quick to disown the oddsmaking on 
gorbachevs future the president said he wants the economic 
reforms of perestroika to succeed and that hed told gorbachev so 
when they met in new york prior to his inauguration 
whenever in the world there is economic reform the united 
states should be hoping that reform succeeds he told the us 
chamber of commerce on monday economic reform with its emphasis 
on incentives and market economics leads to more freedom 
the white house spokesman said bush baker and cheney all want 
the gorbachev reforms to succeed we all agree that glasnost and 
perestroika should be encouraged said marlin fitzwater 
and does the administration believe the reforms will succeed 
the administration chooses not to speculate on that matter

susan harris says the golden girls began 
with a suggestion that she write about a group of older women in 
miami 
but when the suggestion comes from brandon tartikoff 
president of nbc entertainment its a little hard to dismiss 
i hadnt wanted to do any more television said harris who 
had created soap and benson 
but that appealed to me i like writing about older people 
they have more to say theyve led rich lives thats really how it 
started after that i came up with the concept and the characters 
we got the stars we wanted 
the 100th episode of the golden girls airs saturday the 
emmywinning series just completed its third season it was fifth 
in the nielsen ratings for the season another harris creation 
empty nest a spinoff of the golden girls was in ninth 
place 
the golden girls are four women living in retirement in the 
same house in miami bea arthur plays dorothy zbornak a 
nononsense former schoolteacher whose husband left her for a 
younger woman betty white is rose nylund a naive widowed grief 
counselor rue mcclanahan plays blanche devereaux an aging 
southern coquette and estelle getty is dorothys mother sophia 
petrillo whose uncontrollable bluntness was caused by a stroke 
estelle getty was the only unknown when we started casting 
said harris she came in read the part and in two minutes we 
said thats it 
the cast of the pilot also included a gay houseboy but he was 
reluctantly dropped when the roles of the four women proved to be 
much richer than expected 
the contrast between the four women breeds the conflict 
said harris we had to make them quite different or youd end up 
with 30 minutes of nice dorothy comes from queens shes the 
most outspoken the sharpest the strongest character shes a 
survivor rose is not quite in the world shes been protected all 
her life so theres a bit of the ingenue about her shes an 
innocent a bit like jessica in soap 
blanche is a throwback to the old south shes antebellum 
shes scarlett ohara she thinks shes hot stuff but shes 
growing older and is having a tough time sophia is an italian 
mother who spent a lot of time in new york shes a tough cookie 
we gave her a small stroke that wiped out her brain censor so she 
could say what everyone else would like to say but doesnt 
harris said she believes theres lots of life left in the 
girls and that the awardwinning show can go on for many more 
years 
harris confines her writing these days to motion pictures my 
husband calls me the creatordeserter she said after soap 
she married paul witt of wittthomas productions makers of the 
golden girls and empty nest 
she no longer writes episodic tv because for four years she 
wrote every script for soap 
i will never ever do that again she said i had to give 
up my life to do that it was a nightmare i never stopped working 
i couldnt get sick i worked day and night ill never do that 
again my son was 9 or 10 at the time and i didnt get to see much 
of him 
its a tradeoff before soap i lived in a tiny house in the 
valley i discussed it with my son i said this was a way to buy a 
house so when he was 14 he had a nice house with a swimming pool 
i dont regret it it gave me a chance to be more creative than id 
ever been 
harris said she now works slowly she also takes plenty of time 
out to spend with her family which now includes a new baby 
before she began writing she was a housewife who held a number 
of different jobs 
i began writing the way a lot of people do she said i 
was watching tv one night and it was such garbage i said i could 
write better than that i got a copy of a teleplay and used it as a 
guide i sold the first thing i wrote a script for then came 
bronson 
after that she wrote for all in the family maude and 
other comedies then created fay 
harris is still angry about the fate of soap she said it 
was the victim of misinformation and was canceled after four years 
on the air because of pressure from conservative groups who thought 
it too risque 
it could have gone on for many years she said some 
stations wouldnt even run it in prime time i think the show was 
done in good taste its all so innocuous today

among the many financial innovations of the 
1980s few have achieved as much broad popularity as the 
homeequity loan 
it isnt hard to understand why homeequity loans serve as a 
convenient way to tap one of the nations greatest pools of wealth 
on top of that changes in the laws have given them a special 
tax status in contrast to most other types of consumer borrowing 
interest paid on the typical homeequity loan remains fully 
deductible within specified limits 
but with all their advantages homeequity loans also carry with 
them more potential risks and drawbacks than many people realize 
financial advisers say 
as albert ellentuck at the accounting firm of laventhol amp 
horwath puts it homeequity loan agreements like cigarette 
packages should carry a consumer warning in large type caution 
this loan could be hazardous to your financial health 
the biggest pitfall in homeequity borrowing the risk of 
losing your house if you cant keep up with payments has been 
widely publicized and deservedly so 
this point alone makes a powerful case against using homeequity 
credit for any frivolous or shortterm purpose such as a vacation 
or a shopping spree 
ideally the money borrowed should finance an asset with a vaue 
at least as great as the total cost of the loan and expected to 
last at least as long as the term of the loan 
the most obvious example of this kind of asset would be 
improvements to the property itself 
say you take out a 10year home equity loan to finance a new 
car ellentuck observes 
the car is gone long before youve paid off your loan by 
stretching the debt over so long a period youre just racking up 
huge interest charges 
this may seem to be plain common sense but ellentuck points out 
that there are some other possible perils with homeequity loans 
that arent so readily apparent 
homeequity credit often is touted as an inexpensive way to 
borrow since lenders generally charge lower interest rates on 
loans backed by such solid collateral 
although that may be true in principle ellentuck says 
appraisal costs other upfront charges and annual account fees 
make some equity loans a lot more costly than the stated interest 
rate suggests 
watch out in particular he counsels for deals with 
bargainbasement teaser interest rates that can be raised 
sharply just a few months after the loan is made 
in many homeequity deals borrowers are allowed to pay only 
interest charges for a period of time without repaying any of the 
principal 
whatever advantages that may afford ellentuck points out it 
makes a loan more expensive than a conventional arrangement in 
which payments cover both interest and part of the principal 
thats because the balance due remains at its original high level 
furthermore such a setup typically leaves you faced with a 
balloon payment at the end of the loans term which may or may 
not be easy to finance at that time 
if youre seriously considering a home equity loan shop 
around ellentuck concludes 
look for a loan that imposes no points on closing offers a 
low cap on the increase in your variable interest rate and charges 
annual fees of 20 or less

university of michigan based on his studies of 20 noncommunist 
nations the lowsaving american registers the highest level of 
fear of nuclear war 
in 1986 he explains 49 percent of his american respondents 
felt there was an even or betterthaneven chance of a nuclear 
war within 10 years at the same time the us savings rate was 
19th only frances rate was lower 
in japan on the other hand only 15 percent of those surveyed 
in the same year believed the chance of nuclear war within a decade 
was 50 percent or better japans savings rate was bettered only by 
italy and luxembourg 
slemrod believes the evidence might compel a lot of economists 
to revise their views of why americans save relatively little in 
the past he says a lot of people have been blaming it on taxes 
and the social security system 
and you might add on dozens of other things on demographics 
for example a surge of 25to34yearolds has been coursing 
through the economy they must buy furniture houses cars 
childrens clothing and such with money that otherwise might have 
been put into savings 
according to the theory as these yuppies become older theyll 
transmogrify into couch potatoes they will sit before their 
television sets content not to keep buying and traveling they 
will save and invest for the future 
thats just one notion among the others is that the methodology 
by which savings statistics are amassed is faulty as some explain 
it americans use their houses as banks but the statisticians 
dont count that as saving 
social security and private pension plans have been blamed they 
make americans complacent about their futures it is said although 
that notion is receiving a severe jolt from the actual painful 
experiences of retirees 
there is no end to the possibilities that have been seriously 
studied at academic institutions analyzed by elected officials and 
speculated on by economists but there are also some very obvious 
reasons that require no study 
such as 
in america savings are taxed it used to be even worse 
savings were taxed while debt earned the borrower a great tax 
deduction in regard to housing debt it remains so even credit 
card debt still gets a small deduction the tax system in many 
other countries encourages saving even exempting some earned 
interest from the tax collector 
that idea caught on strongly in the united states a decade or so 
ago with individual retirement accounts but iras have since been 
weakened taxes on interest earnings are deferred but no longer is 
there a tax deduction 
in the united states keeping up with the joneses is a much 
derided but much practiced philosophy of life this is a consumer 
society not a saver society 
if you dont think so examine the basic theme of many 
advertisements if your neighbor has something why dont you 
arent you as good in every way as your neighbor then demonstrate 
it 
consider some of the other themes one car is not enough 
neither is one bath in your house in fact one house isnt enough 
good heavens what do you do on weekends 
save banks are for saving arent they maybe not as you might 
conclude from examining the literature you receive from them how 
many seek to have you save with them how many offer you credit 
instead 
the us personal savings rate rarely exceeds 6 percent 
compared with 20 percent or so in japan it is indeed puzzling and 
social scientists will question each other about it for many 
academic years 
the answer however is far more likely to come directly from 
the source from the american consumer who may indeed save little 
because of the bomb but who also might be borrowing more for the 
same reason

catholic educators say they are pleased at the 
vaticans readiness to modify a proposed document on catholic 
colleges and universities that had drawn much american criticism 
three north americans were named to a 15member international 
commission to assist in a major revision of the document 
its initial draft in 1985 had aroused keen objections from us 
catholic educators as projecting a degree of ecclesiastical control 
over colleges that would not be acceptable on the american academic 
scene 
that draft was revised but educators at their april 1825 
meeting with vatican officials called for further major revisions 
and the commission was set up to guide the process 
americans on the commission are the rev joseph a ohare 
president of fordham university the rev edward a malloy

in the temporary navajo tribal council 
office one clock runs five minutes faster than another a few feet 
away an unintended symbol of a government thrown out of sync by 
the alleged corruption of its chairman 
peter macdonald who had held the highest office of the 
200000member tribe with one interruption since 1971 was voted 
out by the tribal council in february following allegations that he 
demanded kickbacks 
the 60yearold macdonald who says hes innocent has lived for 
years like a potentate in plain view of indians whose austere 
circumstances are proverbial and yet while he rode in limousines 
and flew to europe hawaii and the super bowl he also promised 
economic development a vision of herdsmen becoming technicians 
after spending 650000 to remodel his offices following his 
january 1987 inauguration macdonald was secure in his fourth term 
until january when the us senate select committee on indian 
affairs began investigating corruption in tribal governments 
witness after witness told of macdonald demanding kickbacks his 
son peter rocky macdonald jr testified after receiving 
immunity from prosecution using a code term in speaking of 
underthetable payments to his father as golf balls 
when the 88member tribal council began its winter meeting in 
early february it rebelled 
on feb 17 a friday night after many macdonald supporters had 
left the dissidents voted 4913 to place him and vice chairman 
johnny thompson on administrative leave 
the majority picked leonard haskie as interim chairman on march 
10 and has stood united since giving rise to th name 49ers 
the joke around here is that its the 49ers versus the 
stealers said cecil jones of chinle 
past navajo leaders usually were very wealthy men but i 
wouldnt say they compare to macdonald said duane beyal 
haskies press secretary and chief assistant to former chairman 
peterson zah with them they were counting herds of sheep with 
macdonald its the green stuff 
in visits to some of the 109 reservation chapters or wards 
macdonald has maintained his innocence he has refused repeated 
associated press requests for interviews and declined to respond in 
writing to a list of questions 
although the navajo supreme court upheld the council action 
macdonald refused to stop giving orders or vacate what haskie calls 
the mahogany palace wing of the administration building 
i am innocent and i am entitled under the law to be presumed 
innocent but the tribal council could care less macdonald wrote 
in an opinion piece for the gallup nm independent 
he has acknowledged taking gifts from contractors but argues 
gift exchanges are a timehonored way of doing business by indian 
chiefs to haskie thats a distortion of indian tradition 
those gifts were tokens to establish a longterm friendship 
with an individual not hundreds of thousands of dollars but small 
things bracelets moccasins a shawl haskie said 
no one knows how much macdonald realized from the tribes 1987 
purchase of the big boquillas ranch a 491000acre spread in 
northcentral arizona phoenix real estate broker byron bud 
brown testified that he arranged for a scottsdale oilman to buy the 
ranch for 262 million and sell it a few hours later to the 
navajos for 334 million 
brown said he gave macdonald 50000 in cash and the use of a 
bmw sedan along with paying off a 25000 loan dissidents claim 
macdonald may have received onetenth of the profit a federal 
grand jury in phoenix is investigating the allegations 
in 1975 macdonald was indicted on fraud and incometaxevasion 
charges a deadlocked us district court jury in may 1977 failed 
to reach a verdict and the judge ordered a directed verdict of 
acquittal 
the longtime tribal leader is not without defenders 
mr macdonald is a very strong statesman for indian people 
across the country said donald benally chairman of the 
councils advisory committee until haskie named a new panel 
i think we would have really made a big stride in our economic 
development if mr macdonald wouldve gone on without any political 
interruptions 
macdonald an electrical engineer worked in the aerospace 
industry in southern california before he returned to the 
reservation where people still live in traditional fivesided 
logandmud hogans tucked into remote canyons or squatting atop 
windswept mesas 
the native of teec nos pos a tiny community less than five 
miles from both utah and new mexico in the four corners heartland 
of navajo tradition served three terms as chairman before zah won 
the 1982 election 
four years later macdonald defeated zah by about 750 votes out 
of 61000 cast 
haskie said he doesnt know whether hell run for the 
55000ayear position in 1990 he added that he expects the 
chairmanship to have less power when he leaves office 
i never sought this job it just happened so fast said the 
43yearold civil engineer 
haskie has persuaded the us bureau of indian affairs and 
citibank corp of arizona that he is legally in charge 
james h stevens the bias navajo area director said courts 
had upheld the council majoritys action despite macdonalds claim 
that a twothirds majority was needed to remove him from office 
noting that citibank had decided to honor haskies signature on 
checks stevens strengthened haskies hand on april 6 by empowering 
him to allocate contracts controlling 91 million in federal funds 
for such purposes as navajo police work forest management fire 
and judicial services 
stevens a san carlos apache who grew up in arizona views the 
councils action as a legal housecleaning but macdonald has 
claimed that the bia is trying to undermine tribal sovereignty 
this happens in foreign countries not the navajo nation 
said council delegate anderson tully of teesto they are copying 
communistic countries 
john chapela a window rock attorney who claims to have gathered 
37000 signatures in a drive to recall macdonald has visited about 
25 chapters to show the senate videotapes 
mr macdonald is his own downfall said chapela whom 
macdonald has fired from three tribal positions he said macdonald 
is our best salesman of the need for a constitution that would 
ensure accountability and spell out procedures for removing leaders 
macdonald rejects a constitution as an anglo form of 
government and haskie said tailoring a constitution to tribal 
needs would require extensive discussion debates and public 
hearings 
meanwhile the uncertainty continues 
paula martin director of the navajo ethics office said she 
believes many people remain neutral about macdonald with few 
recognizing haskie as a legitimate successor 
i think there should be a new election for chairman she 
said

saabs new flagship model the 1989 9000 cd is an impressive 
roadholder 
a fine suspension package helps it handle curves and winding 
stretches with ease a turbocharged 16valve fourcylinder engine 
helps the car tackle even mountain roads with zest antilock brakes 
make sudden stops uneventful and attention to ergonomic detail 
inside takes the weariness out of travel 
saab can be proud of this its first us offering of a sedan 
and one of the largest among european sedans sold here the 9000 cd 
is new yet still saabish in that it continues the saab tradition 
of performance and practicality 
for example the test car with fivespeed manual transmission 
got 246 miles per gallon a surprisingly good show of 
practicality considering the maneuvers it went through the 
fourcylinder engine was thrifty but the turbocharger contributed 
plenty of zip the powerplant is the same as the one in the 9000 
turbo 
we have been taken to task for not going to six or 
eightcylinders like some other europeans but we think that with 
the 16valve fourcylinder and turbocharger we have the best of 
both worlds said jim ventrilio saab spokesman saab boasts 
that the engine has the potential to not only surpass 130 miles per 
hour but to cruise at such speeds without complaint literally for 
days on end 
handling was enjoyable with good traction and agile 
performance saab engineers its 9000s so 60 percent of the weight 
is over the frontdrive wheels for stable maneuvering the 9000 cd 
has the same rounded styling in front that also is a saab 
hallmark but the rear is decidedly new for this new model the 
automaker added six more inches in length to its 9000 turbo 
hatchback and put in a large flat trunk with 198 cubic feet 
capacity 
the trunk lid pulls up easily and you dont have to heave items 
up and over the car body behind the rear seat armrest is a small 
door that can be opened to allow long items such as skis to pass 
through and be carried inside the auto 
we felt there was a market for a sedan in this country 
looking at the bmws and mercedes ventrilio said other 
competitiors include the audi 200 and volvo 760 series he said 
the test 9000 cd had leather interior so the base price was 
nearly 32000 standard features included sunroof antitheft 
alarm and amfm stereocassette with sevenband graphic equalizer 
fit and finish inside and out was superb the front seats were 
immensely comfortable having been orthopedically shaped for 
support without causing drowsiness or muscle tension 
the front seats also were heated had eightway power adjustment 
and lumbar support the dashboard was easy to read no digital 
stuff here even the clock was the traditional model with hands 
the interior was spacious although a 6foot2 fellow complained 
his head brushed the roof when he sat in the back seat but legroom 
was clearly adequate and the car could carry five in fine style 
saab also has nice touches the company put red lights at the 
opening of the seat belt fasteners so they are easier to find at 
night the center console storage space had a subtle green light 
inside not a glaring bright one and all the knobs in the 
instrument panel are rounded so theres no protruding dangerous 
elements in a crash saab has one of the highest owner loyalty 
records in the industry 
our dealers tell us theyve been selling to some of the same 
people for the last 20 years ventrilio said buyers typically 
are males in their early 40s they are highly affluent and college 
educated according to ventrilio 
it looks as if the 9000 cd could bring in even more buyers as 
the company looks to expand in the west and sunbelt ventrilio said 
since the 9000 cds were available in decent quantities starting in 
january the cars outsold their sibling the 9000 hatchback models 
for each of the first three months of 1989 
in total 879 of the 9000 cds were sold in the period and 
ventrilio says the company plans to import 4700 this year 
consumer reports magazine has no rating on the new model but ranked 
the 1986 9000 turbo average in owner reports of trouble the 1987 
model ranked worse than average

roxana zal says she formed a quick friendship 
with cissy mcclure after playing the young mother in the abc movie 
everybodys baby the rescue of jessica mcclure 
we were very excited to meet each other said zal it was 
strange at first a little awkward then we got along great i 
think we formed a bond we write to each other were keeping in 
touch 
neither of us had any walls up we both wanted to help each 
other jessica took to me too she climbed right up on my lap 
the twohour movie airing sunday on abc is about the rescue of 
18monthold jessica after she fell down an abandoned well near her 
home in midland texas on oct 14 1987 she was trapped 19 feet 
underground in a space only eight inches wide 
its a real ensemble movie said zal it shows how the 
whole town came together to save the life of this child 
zal said she had talked to cissy mcclure several times on the 
telephone before she started the role i think it was better that 
i didnt see her until afterward she said i would have been 
nervous if shed been on the set we tried to make it as accurate 
as possible but there may have been a few dramatic changes 
the movie also stars beau bridges as police chief richard czech 
pat hingle as fire chief james roberts patty duke as carolyn 
henry the victims assistance volunteer who helped the mcclures 
and will oldham as chip mcclure jessicas father 
the movie was filmed largely on location in bellflower a city 
about 12 miles southwest of downtown los angeles 
they made it look just like the original site said zal 
rodney wunsch the reporter from kmidtv who plays himself said 
it was so similar it brought back all those terrible thoughts 
zal who won an emmy in 1984 for her role in something about 
amelia said she had followed the story of jessica mcclure and 
was interested when her agent called about the offer 
my first thought however was that it might be difficult 
she said some films based on news events sound great but the 
scripts dont always work out i knew it would be difficult to turn 
those 56 hours into a good movie but the script turned out well 
and i liked it i like the role too because i get to play a 
mother ive always played daughters and teenagers before 
zal worked on the role while continuing her studies as a 
secondyear student at ucla 
im studying world arts and cultures she said i switched 
from theater arts i get dance music art history and 
anthropology my theater major had too many technical classes and 
labs you had to take all the production courses first before you 
got to the fun stuff im more interested in acting directing and 
playwriting im trying to develop my writing skills 
her most recent project was goodbye miss 4th of july for 
the disney channel it was based on the true story of niki janus a 
member of a greek immigrant family who fought back against 
discrimination by the ku klux klan in west virginia in 1917 the 
movie also starred chris sarandon chantal contouri and louis 
gossett jr 
she made her film debut as jon voights daughter in table for 
five 
she was also in testament rivers edge the cbs 
schoolbreak special god the universe and hot fudge sundaes and 
played the daughter of an alcoholic in the abc movie shattered 
spirits 
after the commercial i was in a pilot she said then i 
decided i didnt want to do a series and prayed it would not go i 
really dont want to do a series i wouldnt be able to go to 
college if i was in a series 
i started acting when i was 11 id wanted to start when i was 
8 but my parents wouldnt let me finally an aunt told them to let 
me try it or id grow up resenting them i can pick and choose my 
roles my parents have provided very well for me and i dont have 
to take anything just to pay the bills 
she said she was considering several things for the summer 
its so hard to find a good script and the competition is so 
tough she said thats why its good to be in school im not 
just sitting around waiting for the telephone to ring

drug abuse has been very very good to gregory 
lousignont 
so has theft 
lousignont has built a career out of finding people who steal 
and use drugs and helping prospective employers steer clear of 
them 
with a doctorate in industrial psychology lousignont has 
developed a series of tests he says help companies screen job 
applicants based on their own admissions of attitudes and behavior 
last year lousignont amp associates inc sold 300000 honesty 
tests and business is booming 
theres been a tremendous influx this year because of the 
antipolygraph legislation he said referring to a recent law 
that bans most private employers use of lie detector tests 
with sales exceeding 1 million last year lousignonts 
business has grown at an annual average of 57 percent since he 
began selling a comparatively crude version of his nowpatented 
honesty tests in 1978 he predicts sales will double by 1990 
lousignont was a police officer in peoria ill in the 1970s 
when he developed a reputation for interrogating suspects by using 
a lowkey straightforward approach his 95 percent confession rate 
made him a standout he said in an interview 
i was sort of blown away by the fact that if i asked someone a 
question theyd usually give you the answer he said if they 
lied to you they became so guilty looking and would start pulling 
at their collar or something that it was obvious 
it was that same approach that led him to develop the tests now 
used by companies nationwide 
persistently surprised at how much people would tell him if he 
asked lousignonts first test contained 100 truefalse questions 
since then it has been refined and now is laced with what 
lousignont called control questions to help determine whether 
the applicant is generally truthful 
he said the tests provide an assessment of a prospective 
employee by measuring his or her propensity to become involved in 
job dishonesty 
the tests available in english and spanish sell for between 6 
and 15 each including the cost of an evaluation analysis by 
lousignonts company it is substantially cheaper than a urine 
test to detect drug use 
now 40 and a millionaire lousignont is one of a few 
individuals who can go up against much larger test marketers such 
as stanton corp london house and reid psychological systems 
his tests have been used by national convenience stores radio 
shack and wackenhut corp the national security firm which has 
certain rights to market the tests 
wackenhut has intros into a lot of companies i couldnt get my 
foot in the door lousignont said 
lousignonts next project he said is to develop a personality 
profile that will help determine whether an individual is suited 
for a particular job for example an accountant doesnt have to be 
an extrovert but the trait certainly is useful for a publicist

we know virginia woolf the writer who gave us 
such groundbreaking novels as to the lighthouse mrs 
dalloway and the waves 
we know virginia woolf the feminist who wrote the influential 
essay a room of ones own and virginia woolf the pacifist who 
created thoughts on peace in an air raid 
we know virginia woolf the diarist who logged the minutiae of 
her tortured life and virginia woolf the suicide who put a heavy 
stone in her pocket and waded into the river ouse 
but until now we have known very little about the virginia woolf 
who was sexually abused throughout her youth a noted woolf 
scholar louise desalvo provides us with the first complete 
portrait of that woman in virginia woolf the impact of childhood 
sexual abuse on her life and work beacon press 2295 
that woolf had been abused was no secret she talked about it 
in speeches letters conversations and memoirs but previous 
biographers have virtually ignored its impact on her life treating 
it as an aberration in an otherwise happy victorian household or 
perhaps even a hallucination of her madness 
desalvo a professor of english at hunter college of the city 
university of new york is the first academician to thoroughly 
examine the abuse in light of modernday research on incest 
survivors 
its not as if it was hidden as a topic in any of the 
biographies that have come before desalvo said in a recent 
interview at her hunter office but the major change is that in 
the last 10 years the work on incest and child abuse as a field has 
been so monumental that it enabled someone like me to use that work 
and to read her life in the context of what we now know the effect 
of incest and child abuse are 
a brief outline of virginia woolfs family and the abuse 
suffered based on woolfs diaries letters and recorded 
conversations with others 
julia duckworth and sir leslie stephen virginia woolfs 
parents had each been married before they wed in 1878 gerald 
stella and george duckworth were children of julias previous 
marriage laura stephen was a child of sir leslies first marriage 
julia and leslie stephen had four children together vanessa 
thoby virginia and adrian 
woolfs mother died when she was 13 and about that time her half 
brother george 14 years her senior began sexually molesting her 
and her sister vanessa the abuse continued until woolf was in her 
early 20s and stopped only when she had a nervous breakdown after 
her father died and the household was broken up stella woolfs 
half sister who took over the running of the household after their 
mothers death may have become sir leslies lover after his wife 
died 
late in her life woolf in a period of intense selfanalysis 
while writing her autobiography suddenly remembered an incident 
that had apparently been repressed of being molested by her other 
half brother gerald when she was 6 in which he broke her hymen 
desalvo thinks woolf was devastated by the realization that the 
abuse began far earlier than she had believed 
there is plenty of other evidence of the household as a 
dysfunctional family woolf had an erotic relationship with her 
sister vanessa that lasted into their 20s woolfs half sister 
laura whom the family considered mentally deficient was locked up 
in a distant room in the house for years before being trundled off 
to an asylum woolfs brother thoby threw himself out of a window 
when he was 15 woolf had an affair with vanessas husband after 
her divorce vanessa took up with the homosexual lover of her 
brother adrian the list of family entanglements goes on and on and 
continues into the next generation 
desalvo reread everything that woolf wrote every novel diary 
letter essay and fragment that has been preserved in the united 
states and great britain and isolated every reference to woolfs 
childhood or her fictional depictions of children 
it was when i did that that it was all thrown into stark 
relief and i saw what she was trying to say said desalvo 
once she learned how incest survivors talk about their 
experiences desalvo said woolfs sometimes puzzling language 
suddenly made sense in a letter to vanessas husband for example 
woolf writes almost flippantly about the sexual abuse the two 
suffered desalvo said that is an example of inappropriate 
response that victims of incest often use as a defense mechanism 
the key to my own beginning to be able to figure it out was 
learning what the language of incest survivors is learning the 
verbal strategies how survivors of incest tend to create inflated 
pictures of their parents 
i couldnt figure out for example for the longest time why 
woolf wrote these revered portraits of her father if you take them 
straight thats one thing but if you read how incest survivers 
typically talk about the family constellation it makes an enormous 
amount of sense 
one of the points desalvo makes in her book is that some of the 
symptoms of the bouts of madness woolf suffered throughout her 
life depression nervousness irritability tantrums are likely 
responses to the sexual abuse rather than the congenital condition 
it is often treated as 
desalvo was asked whether she ever thought woolf with her 
history of instability was perhaps an unreliable narrator the 
memory of the abuse by gerald when she was 6 for example did not 
surface until woolf was in her 50s can her memory be trusted 
one of the biggest issues that always comes up in incestuous 
abuse is the extent to which people falsify memories the paradigm 
used to be freudian the theory that patients reports of sexual 
abuse were figments of their imaginations and based on desire 
all the recent work that has been done on incest survivors suggest 
rather the opposite that any memories are authentic and the 
reason experts say this is that it is so disastrous even today to 
be labeled an incest survivor that no one would falsify that

desalvos new book as disturbing as the subject matter is 
should be heralded for both its painstakingly thorough research and 
the delicate and fair handling of such a sensitive subject this is 
a scholarly not a titillating work at the same time it is 
enormously readable and imbued with the fascination and admiration 
that desalvo has for one of the greatest writers of this century

the new york stock exchange will implement 
computerized offhours trading if companies and investment firms 
want it but no such demand exists now says the chairman of the 
big board 
john j phelan jr said tuesday there has been no interest among 
new york stock market participants to extend trading at the worlds 
secondlargest exchange beyond the current 930 am to 4 pm 
hours 
the reason we have not done it is that our customers have said 
they dont want it phelan told a meeting of the society of 
american business editors and writers 
but he added if there is any sign of interest out there at 
all we will try at least some offhours trading 
in 1986 the nyse surveyed securities brokerages and companies 
listed on the exchange phelan said and 99 percent of all those 
people said for gods sake dont do it we are not interested in 
that now 
the 197yearold nyse second in size to the tokyo stock 
exchange recently announced it would meet with customers traders 
institutional investors listed companies and securities firms to 
regauge demand for offhours trading 
under such a system securities theoretically can be bought and 
sold when the exchange floor is shut down via computers that 
automatically match buyers and sellers from points around the world 
the tiny cincinnati stock exchange last month announced plans to 
start computerized 24hour trading in the next 19 months chicagos 
two futures markets also have announced they are developing 
afterhours trading systems 
phelan played down fears expressed by some securities industry 
experts that markets in foreign countries could siphon away 
business from new york he said the idea of a global market had not 
yet taken hold and that overseas theres more potential than 
actual competition 
global markets and 24hour markets despite all the trendy 
talk are not there because the customers dont want them he 
said 
in the offhours market theres not going to be a heck of a 
lot of orders he added most pension funds are not going to 
wait until two oclock in the morning to make a trade the major 
pool of liquidity is going to be when this market opens 
but phelan conceded that japanese investors buying more stock in 
american companies listed on the tokyo exchange could some day pose 
a threat he said 90 us companies currently trade in tokyo 
its new money thats never been in this market before 
european money has been in this market for years japans money has

jurors at the securities fraud trial of singer 
co chairman paul a bilzerian are getting a short course in 
corporate takeovers tender offers and other wall street 
terminology 
before defense and prosecution lawyers began their opening 
statements to the jury tuesday us district judge robert j ward 
took 10 minutes to explain to the jurors a number of financial 
terms that will come up repeatedly during the trial 
the education was to continue today with a securities law expert 
expected to be the first government witness 
in his opening statement tuesday assistant us attorney david 
e brodsky claimed that in 1985 and 1986 when he emerged on the 
corporate takeover scene bilzerian sought to build a reputation 
for himself as a corporate raider through a series of lies 
he lied to the securities and exchange commission he lied to 
the internal revenue service and he lied to the investing public 
brodsky told the jury at federal court in manhattan 
in the past his lies brought him lots of money said 
brodsky pointing at bilzerian today they bring him to the bar 
of justice 
bilzerian 38 of tampa fla is accused of conspiracy 
violating securities and tax laws and making false statements in 
connection with four failed takeover attempts in 1985 and 1986 
ward dismissed one felony count last month but 11 other counts 
remain 
none of the charges involves bilzerians 106 billion takeover 
of singer last year after a lengthy struggle 
brodsky said another prosecution witness would be former west 
coast stockbroker boyd jefferies who was implicated by convicted 
stock speculator ivan f boesky pleaded guilty to violating 
securities laws in 1987 and has turned government informant 
the indictment alleges that jefferies secretly held stock for 
bilzerian in four unsuccessful takeover transactions involving 
cluett peabody amp co hammerhill paper co hh robertson co 
and armco inc 
the ruse allegedly was used to help bilzerian secretly 
accumulate large stock positions in companies he later would 
attempt to take over 
but defense attorney arthur mathews contended his client was on 
trial because mr brodskys bosses made a dumb deal with an 
admitted felon jefferies 
mathews who did not mention boesky by name theorized that 
jefferies in order to avoid more serious charges implicated a 
few scapegoats including bilzerian because he had no higherups 
on whom to inform 
the government is straining to try and justify the bad bargain 
they made said mathews 
if convicted bilzerian faces a maximum penalty of five years in 
jail and a 250000 fine on each count

a marathon bargaining session led to an agreement 
in principle between amr corp and the transport workers union on a 
new contract averting a threatened strike at american airlines 
the nations largest carrier 
neither side released details of the pact tuesday except a 
brief company statement that said union and management officials 
believe the agreement benefits both the company and the union and 
will enable american to continue the growth plan that has made the 
airline an industry leader 
the statement by fort worthbased amr said the agreement was 
reached after a 27hour bargaining session details were withheld 
pending agreement on final language and ratification 
the airline and union which represents about 23000 of the 
companys 67000 employees submitted to mediation after americans 
proposed 610 million fouryear contract was rejected in march 
the rejected contract guaranteed raises for all employees 
ranging from about 28 percent over four years to about 100 percent 
during the contract however the union objected to americans 
twotier wage scale under which it takes new employees 12 years to 
reach top pay the union wanted that reduced to five years 
in addition there were complaints that even with the increases 
american mechanics and ground service employees would not be the 
industrys highestpaid 
also at issue was the companys plan to have employees pay 10 
per person and up to 30 per family toward health insurance 
each month the company now pays the entire premium 
the mediation continued daily from its april 14 beginning until 
friday when the parties took a twoday break before resuming 
sunday said ed koziatek the twus international vice president 
for american 
airline officials have complained that the contract suffered 
from union politics as several locals were conducting election 
campaigns while the pact was up for ratification in march 
the fouryear pact became amendable on march 1 but was rejected 
12143to5140 however under the federal railway labor act 
transportation contracts do not expire until after a lengthy 
process that involves mediation followed by a 30day coolingoff 
period should the mediator declare an impasse in the negotiations 
the twu represents the airlines mechanics bag handlers ground 
crews stock clerks guards meteorologists and aircraft cleaners 
american had its most profitable year ever last year with those 
profits sustained through the first three months of this year 
amr posted 1988 net income of 4768 million a 1403 percent 
increase from 1987 and 379 percent higher than the previous record 
of 3458 million in 1985 
the company reported a firstquarter profit of 101 million a 
477 percent jump from 1988s first three months operating

polaroid corp chairman william j mccune jr is 
outlining the evolution of polaroid corp from its beginnings to 
its headtohead competition with eastman kodak co in a lawsuit 
against the photographic giant 
polaroid struggled to keep kodak out of the instant photography 
field and now says in the federal suit that kodak should pay 12 
billion in damages for infringing on its patents 
in the first day of testimony tuesday in us district court 
mccune said polaroid and kodak had a productive working 
relationship for decades but things soured in the late 1960s he 
said when polaroid was working on its revolutionary sx70 camera 
kodak which for years had manufactured film for polaroid was 
asked to produce the new complex negative that polaroid had 
developed for the instant color camera but kodak demanded a 
license from polaroid which would have allowed kodak to develop 
its own instant photography said mccune who was to resume his 
testimony today 
there was considerable reluctance to undertake the project 
unless we gave them license mccune said under questioning by 
polaroid attorney herbert schwartz a stumbling block was always 
that we couldnt see how giving kodak a license to make products 
competitive with ours would allow us to stay in business 
polaroid ultimately built its own film manufacturing facilities 
in massachusetts 
instant photography mccune said is all our bread and butter 
and thats everything weve got 
mccunes testimony before judge a david mazzone ranged widely 
from the origins of instant photography after world war ii to the 
introduction of the sx70 camera in 1972 
an earlier federal court decision already established that kodak 
infringed on polaroid patents the remaining question is how much 
kodak owes for that violation 
rochester nybased kodak says it should pay 177 million 
equal to 5 percent royalties on the instant cameras and film kodak 
sold from 1976 until 1985 
mccune said the story began during the war when polaroid 
founder edwin land was in santa fe on a family trip he took 
photographs of his daughter and she asked why she couldnt see it 
right away mccune said he wondered too 
by 1963 with manufacturing help from kodak polaroid developed 
the first color instant photography 
the business grew rapidly in that period mccune said 
revenue of 129 million in 1963 jumped to 571 million in 1972 
polaroids profits after taxes increased from 25 million to 75 
million in that time 
with the introduction of the sx70 mccune said polaroid hoped 
for a dramatic increase in its business 
we viewed it as a revolutionary step and thought it was going 
to dramatically increase the business of the company and increase 
the life of the business mccune said 
but as polaroids lawyers have argued kodaks competition 
starting in 1976 cut into profits and forced polaroid to sell some 
cameras below cost 
if mazzone awards polaroid anything close to 12 billion it 
will be the largest patent infringement decision in history far 
surpassing the record 207 million that smith international inc 
was ordered to pay hughes tool co three years ago for copying 
drill bit technology

us pork producers say they will at 
least get temporary relief from canadian competition as a result of 
a ruling by the us commerce department on an industry complaint 
about subsidized canadian exports 
the government said tuesday it will place a preliminary duty of 
about 3 cents a pound on canadian shipments of fresh chilled and 
frozen pork products to the united states 
the duty in the form of a bond to be posted by importers will 
take effect friday and last until a final decision is announced 
sometime in the fall 
if us pork producers prevail the bond will go into the us 
treasury and a permanent duty will be imposed if the canadians 
prevail the money will be returned 
but in the meantime the bond requirements will make it more 
expensive to ship pork products from canada to the united states 
hopefully that will slow down the surge of pork products 
coming in said dave mehlhaff a spokesman for the national pork 
producers council 
the des moinesbased council said shipments of such products 
have increased by more than 50 percent since 1984 and totaled about 
470 million pounds last year it said a university of missouri 
study indicates the subsidized competition cost us pork producers 
697 million in 1988 and that the cost to meatpackers was even 
greater 
the pork producers have said the canadian government was paying 
its producers a subsidy of 1950 a hog in the third quarter of 
1988 and that it rose to 31 a hog in the fourth quarter 
the ruling was the second in a series of decisions in the case 
the international trade commission issued its preliminary finding 
of subsidized competition in february 
the commerce department will hold a june 28 hearing and issue a 
final decision by july 17 said sen charles grassley riowa the 
international trade commission then will have 45 days to determine 
whether the imports materially injure or threaten injury to the 
us pork industry 
don gingerich of parnell president of the pork council said he 
was delighted the government is interpreting the figures in the 
same way as the industry 
these imports of pork products coming out of canada which 
have increased so dramatically since we put the countervailing 
duties on live animals has really plagued our industry as far as 
the profits we are able to maintain from our herds gingerich 
said

nevadans overwhelmingly approved a 52 
million tax on miners who are now unearthing a gold bonanza that 
rivals production during this states famed comstock lode era 
voters also approved a plan to double the money nevada can 
borrow for new construction 
with all votes counted in tuesdays special election the 
twoyear mining tax hike won 107679 to 30663 the other question 
won by 74418 to 63228 
voter turnout was a low 36 percent election officials around 
the state had predicted turnouts ranging from 30 percent to 40 
percent of the more than 383000 people eligible to vote 
nevada is the nations leading producer of gold during the past 
eight years mines here have produced more than 12 million troy 
ounces of gold with a value of about 5 billion 
at todays prices thats equal to the value of all the gold and 
silver unearthed in virginia city during the twodecade comstock 
lode era that began in the late 1850s 
the mining tax plan was submitted to voters after bitter debate 
in which democratic gov bob miller accused mining industry 
lobbyists of deceit in trying to derail his proposal for 118 
million 
the industry accused him of playing mine games miller 
responded that the industry was trying to give the state the mine 
shaft 
casino owners often targeted for tax hikes because gaming is 
nevadas largest industry also got into the fray arguing that 
its time to change the tradition in which the mining industry did 
not pay its fair share of taxes 
after millers plan was rejected in the senate the 52 million 
plan was endorsed by most of the people who had fought over any 
higher payments 
miller joined in an advertising campaign with mining industry 
leaders to say that without approval the state would face fiscal 
chaos 
had the measure lost the leaders said the legislature would 
have needed to remain in session an extra month to slash budgets 
and raise taxes 
i think its a positive thing for the state to have these 
revenues available miller said late tuesday he added he planned 
to meet with legislative leaders before deciding whether any more 
tax revenues are needed from the miners 
assemblyman marvin sedway democratic chairman of the ways and 
means committee had opposed the 52 million plan 
the amount they would be paying is just a drop in the bucket 
to what they should be paying said sedway it gold is a 
nonrenewable resource and will be gone forever 
the measure allows the state to impose a 5 percent tax on the 
net proceeds of mines during the next two years the question 
resulted from an agreement during the 1987 legislature between the 
mining industry lawmakers and thengov dick bryan 
jim gourdie president of the nevada mining association said he 
hoped passage would end this years tax raising efforts in the 
legislature 
im delighted with the outcome he said i think the 
people have realized this is a reasonable and fair tax

president bush is getting everything he wanted 
and more from the house banking committee to prevent sampls from 
tapping the taxpayers for another bailout but only in exchange for 
new lowincome housing initiatives 
on a 492 vote just before midnight tuesday the committee 
approved bushs 90 billion savings and loan plan the largest 
financial bailout in the nations history after spending four 
days toughening capital standards on the industry and adding a pair 
of housing components 
only reps joseph kennedy dmass and jim leach riowa voted 
no kennedy said the bill did not have enough housing support for 
the poor and complained about the panels rejection of his 
provisions attacking lending discrimination leach said he wanted 
still tougher capital standards 
as it now stands the house bill would require the nations 
3000 thrifts to put up at least 20 billion in new capital over 
the next five years twice as much as a version approved by the 
senate two weeks ago to fulfill bushs promise of never again 
it also would divorce what critics had called a toocozy 
relationship between sampl regulators and the industry and devote 75 
million a year to investigating and prosecuting fraud that is 
blamed for a major portion of the crisis 
on a partyline vote committee democrats overrode 
administration objections to set aside some of the property the 
government is inheriting from failed sampls for lowincome housing 
they also voted to require the industry to subsidize belowmarket 
mortgage rates for lowincome families 
still the overall package won praise from the administration 
this committee exceeded everyones expectations assistant 
treasury secretary david mullins said theyve achieved something 
very close to what we asked for 
the biggest victory for the administration is a requirement that 
sampl owners over the next five years reach a level of having at 
least 3 of their own money in tangible capital at risk for 
every 100 they lend 
weve moved legislation that will deal with a significant part 
of the problem and passed tough capital standards better than 
the senate bill and i would argue better than the bush bill as 
well said rep charles schumer dny 
the bill still has to go through three other committees 
including one where the erection of a formidable roadblock is 
anticipated later this month before a final vote by the full 
house 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas the banking committees 
chairman who spearheaded the administrations drive for the tougher 
capital requirements said industry lobbying efforts to weaken them 
already have shifted there 
and after that new fights over the housing subsidies that were 
rejected in the senate as social engineering are expected to 
erupt in a conference of leading lawmakers from both houses before 
a final version is sent to bush this summer for his approval or 
veto 
as proposed by bush and now approved by both the house banking 
committee and the senate the plan will pump 50 billion over the 
next three years into a federal insurance fund to pay off 
depositors whose money was lost through speculative and often 
fraudulent lending by some 300 to 500 sampls 
another 40 billion to cover the losses of institutions closed 
in the past two years plus anticipated failures over the next 
decade and also shore up the insurance fund will come largely 
from new or increased fees on the industry 
altogether the bailout costs including interest are 
expected to total 157 billion by the year 2000 and 275 billion by 
the year 2020 
the government share will be raised through a complex financing 
plan that keeps the problem off the federal budget and avoids a tax 
increase but at an interest cost to taxpayers of 150 billion to 
200 billion over the next 30 years 
that arrangement is likely to be questioned at least one more 
time by the taxwriting house ways and means committee one of 
three panels yet to review the package 
however the next big showdown will not occur until the bill 
reaches the house rules committee which controls what issues can 
be revisited on the house floor 
the rules panels chairman rep claude pepper dfla said in 
a letter last week he strongly opposes parts of the new capital 
requirements

the federal reserves tightfisted monetary 
policy can curb inflation and prolong economic growth but only if 
business leaders exercise some patience a central bank official 
says 
it takes time for monetary policy to relieve pressure on 
prices federal reserve board member h robert heller told the 
midyear meeting of the conference board tuesday what is needed 
now is a bit of patience to allow the policy that is in place to 
work 
heller in a luncheon address to about 100 executives said the 
fed is not out to take the proverbial punch bowl away 
we would just like everyone to drink a bit more slowly so that 
the party can last a longer time 
heller who has been on the federal reserves sevenmember board 
of governors since 1986 defended the tight rein the fed has kept 
on the nations money supply this year 
that monetary policy has forced interest rates up in an effort 
to ease inflationary pressures by slowing business expansion 
recent economic data have indicated the economy is cooling down 
but the inflation picture is more clouded sharp rises in wholesale 
and consumer prices earlier this year along with a more recent 
surge in oil and gasoline prices have prompted some economists to 
predict a new wave of strong inflation 
the most pessimistic analysts see both recession and inflation 
ahead 
but heller foresees neither 
in general he said the overall outlook is for modified 
growth and subdued inflationary tendencies 
put simply i just do not believe that the preconditions for a 
sustained acceleration in inflation are now in place he said 
on the possibility of a recession he added the imbalances 
which traditionally precede a recession are not visible and 
indications are that the current expansion will continue 
and on the inflation front he said a second year of drought in 
the corn belt is unlikely and agricultural output should return to 
normal this year bringing down food prices 
despite the rise in crude oil prices from about 17 to more than 
20 a barrel since jan 1 recent history of the global oil 
market suggests that prices beyond 20 a barrel will probably not 
hold for long heller said 
although economic growth is slowing he said the vigorous pace 
of corporate investment in plant and equipment expenditures is an 
encouraging sign as is the promise of a bipartisan congressional 
agreement for the fiscal year 1990 federal budget 
reducing the federal budget deficit is essential for continued 
economic growth heller said 
looking beyond the coming year it is important that this 
progress will be sustained in future years as well until fiscal 
responsibility is again the norm 
the conference board is an international network of more than 
20000 senior business executives

mcdonnell douglas helicopter co says a 
slowdown in attack helicopter production is to blame for the 
planned layoff of 450 workers this month with about the same 
number to follow next year 
president bill brown said tuesday that temporary and regular 
employees in all divisions would be cut including 355 at the 
companys mesa plant and 95 at its plant in culver city calif 
brown said those affected would be told by may 12 they will 
receive severance pay and help from the company in finding new 
jobs he said 
the layoffs and budget cutbacks which will include cuts in such 
areas as advertising and marketing are expected to save the 
company about 16 million this year brown said 
one of arizonas largest defense contractors mcdonnell douglas 
has 5000 employees at its plant in mesa and another 3000 in 
culver city 
the company has been building about 10 ah64 apache attack 
helicopters a month but the pentagon has ordered that rate cut 
back to six a month beginning in june 1990 
mcdonnell douglas has delivered about 460 apaches on a contract 
which called for 975 but president bush said two weeks ago in 
unveiling his defense cuts that the army now wants only 807 a drop 
of 168 
it also builds the md500 series of light helicopters and a 
variety of automatic cannons 
due to the twoyear length of the production pipeline we are 
already feeling the dropoff in apache labor required to build the 
reduced number of helicopters brown said 
the company may be forced to lay off another 450 employees in 
mesa and culver city next year if efforts to further broaden the 
companys business base fall short brown said 
about 50 percent of the companys payroll has been based on 
apache sales the company has said 
brown referred to encouraging signs that point toward apache 
sales as early as this year in europe or the middle east 
he said however no contracts had been signed 
nothing counts until someone signs on the dotted line he 
said 
supporters of the apache contend that reductions in nuclear 
weapons particularly in europe have made the antitank helicopter 
more important than ever 
however the apache suffered a major setback earlier this year 
when the commander of the armys 82nd aviation brigade at fort 
bragg nc complained that it was unreliable he said all 12 of 
the apaches in his unit were incapacitated at points during a war 
exercise and only five were in operating condition at the end 
brown denied there is a problem with the apaches reliability 
emphasizing that difficulties experienced with keeping the 
helicopter flying during war games and training were not safety 
related 
the army has a shortfall of maintenance people he said 
despite the layoffs the company will continue to invest heavily 
in research and development as it pursues development of new 
advanced civilian and military helicopters brown said 
were not going to compromise our future he said 
mcdonnell douglas plans to hire about 100 engineers and 
technical specialists this year to help with development of its 
sevenpassenger mdx commercial helicopter and the armys proposed

los angeles billionaire marvin davis has 
agreed to put his hostile 27 billion bid for northwest airlines 
parent on hold in exchange for confidential information on the 
nations fourthlargest airline 
under an agreement announced tuesday by the airline company and 
davis the oilmans offer will remain outstanding but he will 
postpone buying more nwa inc shares until june 30 
separately the new york leveraged buyout firm of kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co indicated an interest in acquiring northwests 
parent nwa inc the wall street journal reported today 
kkr formally told northwest of its interest in a bid the 
journal reported quoting unidentified people familiar with the 
takeover battle the notification came as part of a bidding 
procedure nwa had set up in response to daviss proxy challenge 
the journal said 
if kkr pursues a bid it would be the firms largest known 
buyout effort since it bought rjr nabisco inc for 25 billion in 
february according to the journal 
spokesmen for kkr and nwa refused comment on kkrs apparent 
interest the newspaper said 
kkrs disclosure came in response to a deadline set by nwas 
investment banker first boston corp the journal said bidders 
will next get access to confidential company data as well as 
meetings with company management 
in the the agreement reached tuesday between davis and 
northwest davis also agreed to stop soliciting shareholder proxies 
in an attempt to unseat the companys board of directors at the 
annual meeting set for may 15 analysts generally agreed that it 
may put davis in an improved position 
i would assume that he is no longer hostile hes been folded 
into the process said analyst kurt rivard for minneapolisbased 
dain bosworth inc 
earlier the nwa board rejected davis 90ashare offer as 
financially inadequate 
i think it puts him in a position to make an educated bid for 
the company hes going to have access to information he didnt 
have before rivard said who knows mr davis may look at the 
information and run away from the deal 
in a statement nwa said the agreement affords mr davis the 
opportunity to participate in nwas process for exploring 
alternatives designed to enhance stockholder value 
davis will be treated on an equal basis with all other bidders 
in connection with the procedures which are established by nwa for 
bids in connection with a possible sale of the company added a 
statement from davis acquisition the company davis formed to 
acquire nwa 
davis will be permitted to make its best bid to the board of 
directors for a negotiated acquisition after reviewing the 
nonpublic information davis acquisition said 
but it doesnt mean davis and nwa are on good terms rivard said 
the psychology is he probably hasnt won any friends at 
northwest the way he has handled the deal hes been aggressive 
aggressively hostile to the board the analyst said 
davis said the restrictions will end immediately if nwa 
announces the sale of the company or a nonsale alternative 
including no transaction at all before june 30 
davis also said nwa agreed to give him 10 days notice if it 
decides to pursue certain nonsale alternatives 
nwa shares closed tuesday at 10175 in consolidated new york 
stock exchange trading down 25 cents the davis accord was 
announced after the market closed 
from the beginning of the takeover battle northwest officials 
said they were willing to accept queries from every potential 
bidder willing to sign a confidentiality statement rivard said 
i think effectively what it does is it takes davis from the 
outside and moves him to the inside he said as for nwa rivard 
said it saves them the proxy fight although i think it was a 
long shot for davis 
under the agreement all pending litigation between the parties 
will be put on hold but davis said he will continue his action in 
us district court in st paul to overturn a thursday order by 
state commerce commissioner michael hatch that prohibits minnesota 
shareholders from selling their nwa shares to davis 
under the states antitakeover law hatch has said davis must 
explain how he would operate the airline company in light of the 
large sum he proposes to borrow to buy it 
davis has said he does not intend to sell the the airlines 
strategic assets reduce payroll or move the headquarters from 
suburban eagan but his lawyers have indicated he may refinance or 
sell nwas tokyo real estate reduce travel agent commissions or 
change northwests inflight service 
davis contends disclosure of his specific plans for operating 
the airline as hatch requested would put him at a competitive 
disadvantage with other suitors

nearly 90 countries agreed today to 
support a ban on ozonedestroying chemicals by the year 2000 but 
they split over how to help third world countries pay for safer 
technology 
delegates from 86 countries and nearly 100 nongovernmental 
organizations at the unsponsored conference adopted a resolution 
calling for industrial countries to help developing nations replace 
equipment emitting harmful chlorofluorocarbons but it made no 
specific funding proposals 
mostafa k tolba head of the un environment program proposed 
an international climate fund to help third world countries comply 
with the program to phase out chemicals that deplete the earths 
shield of ozone 
but industrial countries led by britain the united states and 
canada objected favored a bilateral approach 
british environment minister nicholas ridley dismissed tolbas 
idea as simplistic 
it has not been suggested who would run such a fund how it 
would operate on what criteria its funds would be raised and from 
whom and what would happen if they did not contribute ridley 
told the conference 
norway the only country to make a solid proposal offered to 
contribute 01 percent of its gross national income about 88 
million to the climate fund if other industrial nations do the 
same 
tolba suggested a working group from the 48 countries that 
ratified the 1987 montreal protocol draw up a specific funding plan 
and submit it next year 
while politicians discussed finances scientists questioned 
whether alternatives are at hand to replace the most harmful 
chemicals the chlorofluorocarbons used for refrigeration 
insolvents and other industrial processes 
kevin j fay of the alliance for responsible chlorofluorocarbon 
policy said the montreal protocol was based on the assumption the 
chemicals could be substituted by hydrochlorofluorocarbons and 
other new and presumably safer variations the new compounds are 
the best known replacements but we dont know enough about 
them fay told reporters 
they cannot be used until we have the answers to questions for 
their safety for the environment said fay whose alliance is a 
coalition of hundreds of us industries cooperating in the search 
for alternatives 
theres no way that the deadlines can be met if the new 
chemicals are found to be unusable he said 
nongovernmental organizations said tuesdays declaration does 
not go far enough according to david doniger of the natural 
resources defense council in washington they called for a crash 
program to eliminate the chemicals by 1995 
the fourday conference the first meeting of the parties to the 
montreal protocol was to update the 1987 document requiring 
signatories to halve by 1999 their production of five 
chlorofluorocarbons and three halons which break down ozone and 
increase the risk of skin cancers and eye disease 
annual chlorofluorocarbon production is 114 million tons 
twothirds of which is produced by the united states and western 
europe japan produces 12 percent and the soviet union about 10 
percent

wind and cold killed up to 95 percent 
of the winter wheat planted in northern montana and many farmers 
are returning to their fields to plow under the winter crop and 
plant spring wheat 
one third of the states winter wheat acreage has losses of at 
least 80 percent according to a survey by the montana grain 
growers association the northern tier counties that are the heart 
of the states wheat country producing premium hard red winter 
wheat were hard hit 
the further north you get the worse it gets said allen 
taylor montana state university winter wheat breeder 
west of the continental divide where cheaper soft white winter 
wheat is grown in northern counties crop losses are estimated at 
95 percent to 98 percent 
the oldtimers say its the severest winterkill theyve ever 
seen said randy johnson mgga executive vice president 
despite possibly the worst wipeout in state winter wheat 
history jim christianson executive vice president of the montana 
wheat and barley committee said farmers generally are optimistic 
because of the simultaneous return of wet weather and good prices 
the highest wheat prices in eight years 
its raining he said theyre living under entirely 
different conditions than last year they are really upbeat 
im sure its weatherand pricerelated 
still the kill was extensive an mgga survey indicates that 
drought stress last fall and extreme winds and cold over the winter 
killed 95 percent of the winter wheat in toole liberty hill and 
carter counties and northern chouteau county 
hill and chouteau counties are montanas biggest winterwheat 
producers accounting for more than onefifth of the states 
acreage normally planted to winter wheat 
johnson said a survey of members from throughout the state found 
90 percent crop loss in blaine dawson and northern pondera 
counties 80 percent loss in blaine county and 70 percent in mccone 
and northern fergus counties 
normally a 25 percent winterkill is considered severe in 
montana the first official government report on winterkill and 
prospective production totals for 1989 wont be released until may 
11 
the winter was so severe that it killed many perennial alfalfa 
stands said msu legume breeder ray ditterline 
johnson said that when winterkill exceeds 90 percent in winter 
wheat farmers wont take a chance on the remaining winter wheat 
and instead will plow up the entire crop and plant spring wheat 
barley or other springsown crops 
christianson said his conservative guess is that farmers will 
have to replant at least 11 million of the 2 million acres they 
had put into winter wheat last fall 
montanas wheat acreage has been divided about evenly between 
winter and spring varieties but this years harvest may be as much 
as threefourths spring wheat which yields about five bushels per 
acre below winter but usually brings slightly better prices 
the reseeding puts an extra burden on farmers as crop 
insurance does not pay reseeding costs when winter wheat doesnt 
make it also insurance policies on winter wheat are carried over 
to replanted spring wheat but the payoff level is based on 
potentially lower yields

of a surprise 
wheat was expected to open higher following yesterdays white

metric tons of wheat to the soviet union 
the market has had a fairly good gain over the last few days 
and apparently has already factored in the wheat sale said joel 
karlin an analyst for research department inc in chicago 
corn and soybean prices were mixed with the prospect of more 
rain in the midwest weighing on the market 
in early trading wheat was cent to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 426 a bushel corn was cent 
lower to cent higher with may at 373 a bushel oats were 1 
cents to 2 cents lower with may at 182 a bushel soybeans were 
1 cents lower to 4 cents higher with may at 738 a bushel

striking united mine workers resumed 
picketing today after union and pittston coal group inc officials 
agreed to sit down with federal mediators but disagreed on a 
sevenday coolingoff period 
by midmorning the picket lines remained peaceful unlike tuesday 
when strikers pelted company coal trucks with rocks several miners 
and truck drivers were injured 
also tuesday 125 demonstrators were arrested at the companys 
moss no 3 coal preparation plant at st paul those arrested some 
of them miners wives sat in front of plant entrances to block 
coal trucks they were charged with trespassing a misdemeanor 
said state police lt cf eaton 
about 1500 miners in southwestern virginia and west virginia 
have been on strike since april 5 the miners had been working 
without a contract since february 1988 
the mediation agreement was announced tuesday in richmond by 
virginia gov gerald l baliles 
umw president richard trumka said the union was committed to 
bargaining around the clock beginning immediately for seven days 
trumka also suggested a sevenday cooling off period during which 
pittston would cease production and the union halt its 
demonstrations 
but pittston president michael odom said he did not want his 
company a division of the pittston co of greenwich conn to be 
bound by a sevenday period for mediation 
we strongly believe the mediator assigned to the dispute 
should have some opportunity to become familiar with the very 
complicated issues involved he said 
odom also said he saw no reason for a coolingoff period 
lawful and peaceful picketing is not an impediment to the 
process it is the unions violence that brings disruption to the 
coalfield communities he said 
the injuries occurred at a coal processing plant near mcclure 
where coal trucks were being driven by workers from jamb coal co 
under contract to pittston 
state police spokesman charles vaughn said troopers told him the 
injured strikers were in a parked vehicle that was hit by a coal 
truck when the driver attempted to flee a hailstorm of rocks 
thrown by miners 
but miner larry stanley said about 20 miners were standing 
around watching the coal trucks drive around a tree downed in the 
road when the driver of an escort vehicle rammed into the crowd 
he done his best to run over all he could said stanley 
debbie hall nursing supervisor at russell county medical center 
in lebanon said five strikers were treated there and released and 
two others were admitted one truck driver was admitted and another 
was transferred to humana hospital in richlands she said

pilots for trans world airlines said today they 
would appeal a new york state supreme court justices decision that 
upheld the actions of twa chairman carl c icahn in taking the 
company private last year 
justice michael dontzin tuesday rejected a challenge by the 
pilots which said the october transaction violated labor 
agreements 
dontzin ruling after a trial held in december found that the 
going private transaction was accomplished in accordance with twas 
labor agreement the airline said after tuesdays ruling 
pilot capt thomas ashwood said the appeal seeks to improve the 
financial condition of the new yorkbased carrier by forcing 
compliance with contractual commitments intended to assure the 
profitable growth of twa 
the most recent twa financial statement filed with the 
securities and exchange commission confirms our reasons for filing 
this suit and the absolute necessity of pursuing it through the 
appellate process ashwood said in a prepared statement today 
the alpa agreements were entered into in late 1985 and early 
1986 when icahn assumed control of the airline said twa which is 
based in suburban mount kisco ny

going private transaction have been vindicated and found to be 
totally consistent with my commitment to my unions icahn said in

car and light truck sales by the nations big 
three automakers in late april dropped 3 percent compared with the 
same period a year ago when sales were moderately strong the 
companies said wednesday 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp said 
they sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 41487 
during the april 2130 period this year compared with a rate of 
42772 during the same time last year 
a 62 percent drop in car sales was offset partially by a 27 
percent increase in light truck sales by the big three 
for the entire month when each of the companies offered 
wideranging incentive packages car and truck sales were up 63 
percent this year over last april for the year through april 
vehicle sales were down 57 percent compared with the same period 
last year 
the companies have been looking closely at sales results after 
the usually strong march and april buying season got off to a slow 
start the incentives are aimed at boosting vehicle sales which 
sagged below expectations during the first three months of the 
year and at forestalling production cuts later in the year 
however analysts have said they expected the companies to trim 
their production rates during the second half of the year mainly 
through extended modelchangeover times during the late summer and 
early fall 
fords car sales suffered the most during late april running 
74 percent behind last year fords cars sold at an average daily 
rate of 7980 this year compared with a rate of 8619 during the

the interview went well but before alfonso morris got his 
clerks job at a stop n go store in dallas he had to spend an 
hour taking a test aimed at determining whether hes a liar thief 
or substance abuser 
it wasnt the first time in the past two years morris 26 had 
been asked by three prospective employers to submit to a 
paperandpencil grilling about whether hed used drugs or stolen 
any money or merchandise 
his experience reflects a nationwide quest to create a 
drugfree theftfree workplace which has increased employer use 
of honesty and integrity tests designed to identify potential 
problem workers 
they told me they give the survey to everyone before they hire 
them basically to screen you morris said of stop n go which 
hired him in march i didnt think too much about it i know im 
a good person and should screen well 
but critics complain the tests amount to a written version of a 
liedetector or polygraph exam violate privacy arent scientific 
and encourage lazy hiring practices some contend the tests can be 
designed to detect political beliefs or union sympathies 
others fear honest applicants mistakenly will be denied jobs 
although test creators warn against using their questions as the 
sole determinant of employment because the tests arent 100 percent 
foolproof 
many businesses have reason to suspect workers government and 
private estimates suggest substance abuse costs about 177 billion 
a year in absenteeism lower productivity lower workquality and 
higher benefits costs while employee theft accounts for estimated 
losses of 40 billion a year 
honesty tests range in cost from 6 to 15 each including an 
evaluation of the results by the test creators for identifying 
drug abusers they are becoming an attractive alternative to urine 
tests which can cost up to 50 each are often considered 
unreliable and face growing legal challenges 
a law that took effect in december barring most private 
employers from administering polygraph tests also gave written 
honesty tests a boost 
as soon as polygraph testing was banned a bunch of 
entrepreneurs got in the act and developed tests that do not 
specifically violate any laws and act against other mechanical 
forms of testing said loren siegel an attorney for the american 
civil liberties union in new york 
the first honesty or integrity tests were developed in the 1960s 
by a company now called reid psychological systems but their use 
has multiplied in the past few years in 1986 an estimated 23 
million honesty tests were administered the number is expected to 
jump to 55 million by next year 
the tests are surprisingly straightforward they might ask 
whether the applicant has ever stolen anything from an employer or 
how many times in the past month the applicant has used drugs 
william rognas a kentucky fried chicken franchisee with five 
stores in illinois for the past two years has required applicants 
to take an honesty test results are startling 
rognas said his food costs have dropped about 4 percent because 
employees arent stealing and labor costs are down the same amount 
as efficiency improved 
we hired one guy without the test and asked him to take it 
later he failed and we ended up firing him because he was 
stealing it works rognas said 
the nationwide crusade against drugs is considered a major 
catalyst pushing employers into the nebulous frontier of employee 
privacy a lot of this stuff would not be possible were it not 
for the drug scare that exists siegel said people are 
willing to sacrifice some very fundamental rights of privacy 
with the federal government conceding the drug problems awesome 
magnitude some experts say a policing function has been 
shifted to business siegel said employee testing represents the 
privatization of law enforcement 
who would admit to drug abuse or theft gregory lousignont 
whose las vegasbased company develops and markets honesty tests 
said he continually is surprised at how forthright applicants are 
about past transgressions 
of 10723 people applying for work at a national convenience 
store chain that took his test last year 777 admitted to having 
shoplifted a total of 26190 in merchandise 902 said they think 
about shoplifting and 290 admitted having stolen 67579 in 
merchandise from previous jobs 
of 10440 people tested for the same company 1142 admitted to 
overdrinking 739 said they used cocaine and 37 said they sold 
amphetamines 
questions are designed to prevent a person who used marijuana 
once 5 years ago from being lumped into the same risk category 
as one who sold cocaine last week lousignont said 
experts say some people confess outright because it describes 
behavior that has become normal for them others are likely to be 
tripped up by questions that probe attitudes toward stealing and 
taking drugs 
employees have no recourse but to submit to testing even though 
experts say court challenges to the tests are inevitable 
if you dont take it they wont hire you and theres nothing 
you can do about it thats the bottom line the aclus siegel 
said 
the vast majority of people dont object reid psychological 
statistics showed 92 percent of test takers accepted the test while 
only 3 percent resented it and the rest had no opinion 
theyre userfriendly uncomplicated and nonstressful said 
robert mccrie an assistant professor at john jay college of 
criminal justice in new york 
often people are told its just part of the screening 
process he said theyre very revealing an individual that 
could never ask about integrity in a facetoface interview gets 
information from people who quite willingly provide it 
nonetheless the tests are coming under scrutiny last october 
the house education and labor committee requested a study on the 
tests validity and the ethical implications of their widespread 
use the study conducted by the office of technology assessment 
is expected to be completed this summer 
committee member rep pat williams dmont said the tests are 
epitomized by a countrywestern song that goes if you hang em 
all you get the guilty 
businesses particularly small ones appear to find it easier 
to throw a very wide net than to specifically try to do legitimate 
and appropriate personnel screening williams said 
paperandpencil tests may not be valid but theyre a hell of a 
lot cheaper than personnel departments 
the american psychological association is studying whether the 
tests conform to research standards since virtually all test 
studies have been conducted by the companies that sell them 
the publishers say the tests are valid 80 percent of the time 
there seems to be some skepticism but basically the jurys 
still out said wayne camara the associations director of 
scientific affairs

the white house said wednesday that president 
bush will veto compromise legislation worked out by the house and 
senate to raise the mimimum wage from 335 to 455 an hour by 
1991 
reacting to tuesdays agreement between house and senate 
negotiators on legislation to change the wage rate for the first 
time in eight years white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said bush continues to believe the figure is too high 
the presidents position is the same and he reiterated that 
during a meeting with republican senators the spokesman said 
his first proposal for a 425 top rate was his last proposal 
he is prepared to veto the bill if they send it up 
bushs stance sets up the first showdown on domestic policy 
involving the new president and the democraticcontrolled congress 
labor secretary elizabeth dole several weeks ago told bush there 
were enough senate supporters of his position to sustain a veto an 
override of a presidential veto requires twothirds of those 
present and voting in both the house and the senate 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas also said bush would 
hold to his earlier promise to veto the bill 
i just want to set the record straight the president will 
not yield on this dole said in reaching consensus on a final 
bill so swiftly dole said democrats pushing the legislation in 
effect asked for a confrontation with the president 
it took less than an hour tuesday for the conferees to complete 
their work thanks in large part to staff negotiations conducted 
during last weeks congressional recess 
also contributing to the speedy resolution was that the major 
elements of the house and senate bills were the same each called 
for raising the hourly minimum wage from 335 to 455 by october 
1991 and for allowing employers to pay some new workers a 
subminimum training wage for two months 
on the subminimum the final product contains language very 
close to the senate version allowing employers to pay new hires 85 
percent of the minimum wage if the newcomers have not held a job 
for more than 60 days once an individual held a job for 60 days 
he or she would never again be eligible to be paid the training 
wage 
the legislation could reach the white house within two weeks 
after passage by the separate houses 
bush has said 425 an hour is the highest minimum he will 
accept and even that support hinges on a sixmonth subminimum that 
could be paid to all new hires regardless of past job experience 
democrats sponsoring the legislation said they were prepared to 
confront bush with the measure and would attempt to override his 
expected veto although they concede bush currently has more than 
enough votes to stymie an override effort

jim colbert once earned a living by artfully 
whacking a little ball across expansive green lawns and sandy 
gullies seldom thinking about the battles with mother nature that 
go into golf course designs 
now that hes switched from pro to proprietor he thinks of 
little else 
today jim colbert golf inc owns or operates 14 public and 
private golf courses from california to florida with the number 
expected to expand into the 20s by the end of the year 
colbert is rolling now but hes learned the hard way that 
weather can make or break a good golf operation 
this whole business evolves around water colbert 48 said 
in an interview you may be plagued with too much or too little 
once a course is built the only thing left is drainage drainage 
drainage whether its yours or the lords 
with our courses in louisiana the problem is too much water 
in las vegas its too little 
the exception was in 1984 when a rare las vegas flood swamped a 
course where colberts fledgling company had spent 1 million in 
remodeling work 
it took 15 million and two years to fix it up colbert 
said of damage to the old countyrun winterwood golf course that 
was our welcome to the golf course business 
today colberts company has 500 employees at courses in nine 
states 
colbert credits a bad back and a decade of duty on the 10member 
pga tour policy board with nudging him into the golf course 
business 
he served with the leaders of giant corporations learning how 
to build companies and golf courses by the time he left the board 
in 1984 the organization had built 12 tpc the players club 
courses 
the courses are used as a pga tournament course once a year and 
the remainder of the year as public or private courses they are 
operated by the pga tour and are very good profit centers for the 
tour colbert said 
being involved in the building of these courses peeked my 
interest in golf courses colbert recalled 
colbert won his first pro title in 1969 by the time nagging 
back problems forced him to the sidelines 18 years later he had 
won eight tournaments and more than 15 million in prize money 
i didnt play half the time colbert said of a fouryear 
span beginning in 1976 when the back problems intensified it 
looked like my career was over 
a native of elizabeth nj colbert grew up in the kansas city 
suburb of prairie village kan and attended kansas state 
university in manhattan on a football scholarship from 1959 to 
1964 honing his golf skills as well 
he called on old friend ron fogler whod run the manhattan 
country club for 23 years when he cut a deal with the city of las 
vegas to take over the city course in 1981 
id been a touring pro colbert said i didnt know much 
about the operational end of things 
fogler who had twice served as pga vice president took over 
the management of the company concentrating on construction and 
remodeling of courses he remains a key to the companys 
operations utilizing four decades of expertise in the golf course 
business 
the company took on its second project in 1983 clark countys 
winterwood course it spent 1 million remodeling the course 
located on the east side of las vegas a disastrous flood that 
swamped las vegas in 1984 caused 15 million damage to the course 
and left a twoyear rebuilding challenge 
the second one almost killed us colbert said we had to 
get no 3 phoenix no 4 san dimas calif and no 5 tulsa to 
pay for no 2 it was kind of like murphys law took over whatever 
could go wrong did 
today colberts company owns or operates courses in california 
florida nevada louisiana north carolina kansas tennessee west 
virginia and arkansas he declined to give a dollar value of his 
company 
besides long hours in his las vegas office and trips around the 
country checking out new course opportunities he also serves as 
sportcaster analyst for the espn network at 18 golf tournaments a 
year 
we look for problems colbert said his search for new 
properties we look for shortcomings if we can identify and 
solve them were a serious buyer we think more of a product many 
times than the people who own it 
the art of this trade is buying something and making a profit 
well take a bad facility as long as we know we can make it 
better 
did he ever dream hed be a major player in the golf course 
business 
i wish i could say i was that smart but too many people know 
me colbert laughed i saw a tiny hole and i went through that 
door

eighteen months after the stock market crashed 
and took thousands of jobs with it wall street still is feeling 
the aftershocks 
investor mistrust and high interest rates have triggered a 
recession in the securities industry forcing a second wave of 
cutbacks at firms awash in profits in the mid1980s 
despite rising prices that have pushed many stocks to postcrash 
highs securities firms have reported weak firstquarter earnings 
or outright losses and slashed payrolls by about 2600 workers in 
the last month 
the cutbacks have pushed wall street layoffs to more than 25000 
since the dow jones industrial average plunged 508 points on oct 
19 1987 the largest singleday decline in new york stock exchange 
history 
at long last after a year of much lower levels of 
profitability they realized they have to take the bulls by the 
horns and do something said perrin long of lipper analytical 
services corp its just like when you and i get a toothache we 
take a day or two before we go see the dentist 
the staff reductions are blamed on slow business in all 
segments from low volume on the new york stock exchange to a dive 
in stock and bond underwriting to declining merger activity 
they also represent what wall street strategists like to call a 
correction a counterreaction to a hiring frenzy from 1982 to 
1987 in which securities firms expanded by 20 percent to 30 percent 
annually and freshfaced businessschool graduates made sixfigure 
salaries 
some firms expanded a couple years ago like it was never going 
to end said lawrence eckenfelder who follows wall street for 
prudential bache securities inc in san francisco theres too 
much capacity and were going through this painful retraction 
business is so bad that the wall street journal diary of the 
financial world recently published a fivepart series titled 
wall streets recession illustrated by cobwebs on a street 
sign in lower manhattan 
some symptoms of wall streets malaise 
total employment by nysemember brokerages has fallen from a 
peak of 262100 employees in september 1987 to about 236000 today 
according to the securities industry association a trade 
association of brokerages the firms had hired more than 100000 
workers from the end of 1981 to the crash 
average daily trading volume on the nyse was 159 million shares 
in march compared with a 1987 average of nearly 189 million shares 
and 1988 average of about 162 million shares 
merger activity an important source of business for wall 
street has fallen to its lowest level in more than two years 
according to idd information services inc a financial reporting 
service 
in the first quarter of 1989 708 deals worth 496 billion were 
completed vs 996 deals worth 1017 billion in the previous 
quarter idd figures show even discounting last years 25 billion 
rjr nabisco inc buyout the biggest takeover in history the value 
of completed deals was off about 25 percent 
fees generated by underwriting new issues of corporate stocks 
and bonds have plummeted in the first quarter of 1989 305 new 
issues generated fees of 5547 million less than half the 692 new 
issues and fees of 135 billion in the same 1988 period according 
to securities data co 
drexel burnham lambert inc is selling its entire retail 
brokerage division of 2300 workers partly because of its bad 
image from an insider trading scandal but more from generally bad 
business further large cuts are expected in drexel bond units 
first boston corp laid off 200 employees morgan stanley amp co 
dropped 30 professionals and goldman sachs amp co reportedly has 
let go dozens of bond traders 
analysts forecast another 5000 to 10000 layoffs in coming 
months 
we are in the midst of a very serious chronic crisis 
salomon brothers inc chairman john gutfreund whose firm lost 28 
million in the first quarter told a recent meeting sponsored by 
the investment association of new york 
some analysts said the public also has learned from the 1987 
crash which wall streeters euphemistically have taken to calling 
a market break the lesson that the volatile nature of the 
market may not be worth the risk 
with yields of 9 percent or more on money market funds and 
certificates of deposit individual investors are steering clear of 
the riskier stock market but for securities firms commissions on 
money market investments made for customers are far lower than for 
stocks 
now were just not addressing the issue of overcapacity now 
the revenues just arent coming in said jack barbanel senior 
vice president of gruntal amp co a midsized new york securities 
firm 
overall barbanel said commissiongenerated revenues are down 
about 35 percent across the board 
the public has generally decided to stay on the sidelines and 
take advantage of the high yields with the minimum amount of 
risk he said if you can get 9 or 10 percent on a riskfree 
basis theres no point for someone with limited resources to 
speculate in the stock market 
james cloonan president of the american association of 
individual investors in chicago said the average stock holding 
among the 105000 members of his organization has fallen 6 percent 
in the last two years to about 29 percent of portfolios 
the industry just kept spinning on their best day and best 
month and thats not how the world works he said 
but if business is so bad why have some stockmarket price 
barometers reached postcrash highs with the dow jones industrial 
average poking through the 2400 mark 
analysts attribute the rise to a strong dollar luring foreign 
investment into the market and to cautious trading by investors 
still participating also they said recent corporate mergers and 
takeovers have sharply increased the value of some stocks 
a stillstrong economy has put corporate earnings about where 
they should be analysts said but without large numbers of 
transactions wall streets firms dont necessarily profit higher 
rent and salary costs from the boom days also have hurt securities 
firms 
there is less volume in firms that have higher overheads 
said robert brusca chief economist with nikko securities 
international inc they find their profit margins on each trade 
are even lower than before ouch ouch

pan am corp reported wednesday its 
firstquarter loss widened to 1511 million from 833 million a 
year earlier due in part to the bombing of its flight 103 over 
lockerbie scotland in december 
pan am said the attack on flight 103 in which 270 people were 
killed raised passenger concern about terrorism and led to a 16 
percent drop in atlantic traffic at the corporations main 
subsidiary pan american world airways 
revenue from the pan am shuttle and pan am express jumped 464 
percent to 599 million from 409 million pan am said the 
shuttle benefited from the troubles at eastern airlines which 
culminated with a machinists strike near the end of the quarter 
the parent company reported 7335 million in revenue for the 
first three months of 1989 down from 7639 million a year earlier 
pan am which has suffered losses for several years said its 
labor expenses increased despite costcutting contracts with its 
unions 
however the company said that aside from the drop in atlantic 
traffic its results were about as expected

control data corp is discussing with 
several parties the possible sale of assets of its defunct eta 
systems supercomputer subsidiary the president told shareholders 
wednesday 
in the case of eta we are currently meeting with customers 
and vendors president larry perlman said at control datas 
annual meeting we are also in very preliminary discussions with 
several parties to attempt to sell eta assets and technology 
if control data tries to sell eta assets to a japanese company 
some analysts say it would raise concerns in congress that valuable 
us technology would be handed over to a foreign country 
meanwhile control data chairman robert price told shareholders 
that last months decision to close eta and streamline the 
companys cyber systems mainframe business was painful but 
essential to the continued successful implementation of the 
companys strategic focus 
control data said the restructuring would result in charges of 
490 million and layoffs of 3100 employees including 800 at eta 
which failed to make money in its sixyear history 
price said the restructuring should result in a profitable 
second half and set the stage for sustained growth 
price said he is cautiously optimistic that control data can 
arrange new credit of somewhat over 100 million to cover 
shortterm cash needs until later this year when the company 
expects to complete the sale of some assets 
the company took a step in that direction wednesday announcing 
that it had sold action data services to primerica corp terms of 
the sale were not disclosed 
st louisbased action data services which had revenues of 
233 million in 1988 provides data processing and support 
products to consumer credit companies and other financial services 
institutions including primericas commercial credit co 
subsidiary 
several shareholders criticized company management for a 
severance agreement that gave retired executive norbert berg nearly 
4 million although control data reported profits of only 17 
million in 1988 
berg who still serves on the board of directors and acts as a 
parttime consultant to the company after serving as one of control 
datas key executives during his 29year tenure received scattered 
boos when introduced to the shareholders at the start of the 
meeting he did not address the group

america west airlines which has grown in 
six years to the 10thlargest air carrier in the nation has no 
qualms about extending itself to the northeast 
we consider this one of the most profitable opportunities in 
our industry chairman edward beauvais told a news conference 
wednesday after announcing a 726 million offer for eastern 
airlines northeast shuttle operation 
beauvais estimated his airline would need to hire 800 employees 
to run the shuttle he said he expected annual revenue of 300 
million to 400 million from the operation 
america west offered 390 million cash for the shuttle with the 
balance in cash and debt assumption on 10 boeing 757 aircraft a 
press release said however beauvais said the other 336 million 
included 21 boeing 727s 
america west does not want the 727s but would dispose of them as 
a credit back to eastern or in other ways beauvais said 
the offer had to be made in haste because us bankruptcy judge 
burton r lifland had scheduled a may 12 hearing on the 365 
million offer for the shuttle from new york developer donald trump 
beauvais said eastern filed for chapter 11 protection march 9 and 
lifland must approve any sale of assets 
if successful in its bid america west would operate the shuttle 
from its headquarters in this phoenix suburb 
this would improve our visibility on the east coast and it 
fits right into our specialty which is highfrequency service in 
highdensity markets beauvais said 
america west is the nations largest airline without any 
unionrepresented employees and beauvais said the operation would 
be an america west operation with america west employees he 
said eastern employees would be interviewed for possible rehiring 
asked if he expected opposition from labor beauvais said he 
didnt think so because the 800 jobs represent only a fraction of 
easterns workforce 
i think eastern employees would be very enthusiastic 
beauvais said because first the fringe benefits at america 
west compare favorably with easterns and second the environment 
at america west is very good 
in the last year america west has applied for service to japan 
and australia and has ordered 25 boeing 737300s or 757s for 
delivery between 1992 and 1995 despite the 800 million order 
beauvais said america west was far from overleveraged 
the firms new york investment banker wertheim schroder amp co 
has assured company officers that the financing could be 
accomplished he said 
this seems like a large chunk its not beauvais said 
this is a 900 million company weve always been adequately 
financed and weve never had a cash problem were well suited to 
take advantage of these opportunities 
started in mid1983 with 280 employees and three 737s america 
west today has about 8500 employees and 70 planes it serves 47 
cities 
it carried 127 million passengers last year turning a 94 
million profit on revenue of 7757 million in the first quarter 
of 1989 america west posted a 101 million profit

to pursue an employee buyout of strikeplagued colt firearms which 
was put on the market last week by colt industries inc 
springfield massbased smith amp wesson corp a colt 
competitor has also expressed interest in buying the division 
robert madore president of local 376 of the united auto 
workers said the company had hired the waterburybased naugatuck 
valley project which has assisted in other employee buyout 
attempts to conduct a feasibility study 
the project asked morgan stanley amp co the new york investment 
banker hired by colt industries to sell the firearms division to 
supply financial information about colt wednesday morning madore 
said 
we are firmly commited to pursuing at whatever lengths the 
feasibility and possibility of making an offer madore said we 
dont see any other manufacturer buying colt firearms with a 
commitment to staying in connecticut 
madore predicted that any other company that bought colt 
firearms would sell off its assets take control of its patents and 
close its hartford and west hartford plants 
new yorkbased colt industries announced friday it wanted to 
sell the troubled firearms division to concentrate on its 
aerospace automotive and industrial services operations 
colt has not put a price on the division but industry analysts 
have said it probably is worth 150 million to 200 million 
the uam represents about 1100 workers who walked out three 
years ago the firearms division has staffed its hartford and west 
hartford plants mostly with nonunion replacement workers although 
some union members have crossed picket lines and returned to work 
about 800 workers remain on strike 
about 650 strikers voted unanimously tuesday night to pursue the 
buyout madore said 
andrew w brecher deputy commissioner for the state department 
of economic development said the department has specialists who 
can advise employees on how to obtain financing for such buyouts 
although he warned the buyouts face enormous difficulties 
the track record is spotty he said there havent been 
that many successful ones in connecticut the ingredients really 
require that you have a very patient seller a seller that for one 
reason or another is motivated to work with employees

wednesday to search for new means to combat foreign inroads in the 
us market 
we know that the textile and apparel workers that we represent 
need their jobs said rep marilyn lloyd dtenn chairman of the 
congressional textile caucus we will have to find creative 
legislative solutions to slow the flood of imports that is 
threatening their jobs 
lloyd said president bush already has made it clear that he will 
not back omnibus legislation to aid the textile industry congress 
has passed such measures in recent years but sponsors have been 
unable to muster enough votes to override presidential vetoes 
instead of putting all of their efforts into one bill lloyd 
said textile lawmakers would pursue many avenues to assist the 
textile and apparel industry our legislative activities will be 
much more diverse than they have been in recent years 
as examples she cited a bill introduced by rep ed jenkins 
dga that would eliminate a scheduled 50 percent cut in tariffs 
on textiles and apparels imported from caribbean basin initiative 
countries 
rep bill hefner dnc may offer measures involving military

the eec commission wednesday released 
its 1989 report on us trade barriers singling out 42 regulations 
and trade practices that it said impedes imports from the 12 
european economic community nations 
the barriers include quantitative restrictions export 
subsidies customs barriers public procurement policies 
countervailing duties antidumping procedures and tax policies 
the eec report said 
its release came five days after the us administration 
released its report on foreign trade practices it considers unfair 
eec commission spokesman claus ehlermann said the timing of the 
release of the eec report was not linked to the us report he 
said the eec report was an annual event and its release simply 
coincided with the report by the office of the us special 
trade representative 
the eec report criticized the 1988 us fair trade practices act 
which it said will make it more likely that unilateral action 
will be taken to redress allegedly unfair trade practices 
such unilateral actionwithout authorization from the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade is illegal 
the report also cited the buy american provision of the us 
trade act that has created permanent discrimination in favor of 
us products 
the clause provides for action by the us administration 
against foreign countries which discriminate against us products 
or services in government procurement including a ban against 
offending countries 
another category of restrictions includes us measures which 
have been found to violate international trading rules and in 
which the united states has neither modified nor offered 
compensation to its trade partners for trade damage caused 
as examples the report cites the us failure to implement 
findings of the gatt on the illegality of the superfund oil 
levy and the nonconformity of the us system of customs 
users fees

two connecticut lawmakers declaring that 
cable television has turned from a luxury into a psychological 
necessity for millions of americans vowed wednesday to press for 
consumer protections against fastrising rates 
sen joseph i lieberman dconn and rep christopher shays 
rconn introduced legislation to place regulations on an industry 
that they say has been riding roughshod over consumers since it 
began setting its own rates 2 years ago 
it is time to return consumer protections to cable 
television lieberman said were not trying to punish the 
cable tv industry were just saying lets be fair 
congress barred state and local governments from setting cable 
tv rates in most jurisdictions effective dec 29 1986 the move 
was designed to foster growth in the relatively new industry cable 
companies had complained that their basic rates were kept 
artificially low by local officials who were subject to election 
pressures 
but with virtually no competition more than 99 percent of the 
nations cable systems enjoy a local cable monpoly basic service 
prices have risen 32 percent since deregulation shays said the 
commerce department estimates that rates will increase by about 14 
percent this year according to lieberman 
shays said the monthly service fee on the basic package in his 
southern connecticut district has increased from 450 in 1984 to 
1995 today 
it is one thing for the government to foster the growth and 
development of a fledgling industry and quite another to allow 
a powerful industry to continue extracting monopoly prices from the 
nations consumers the senator said 
you cant have it both ways shays said at a news 
conference theres either got to be competition or regulation 
lynn mcreynolds of the national cable television association 
argued that cable tv operators do not have monopolies because the 
138 billion industry competes with commercial television as well 
as video rentals satellite tv and movie theaters 
cable is a competitor in the entertainment marketplace and 
theres lots of competition she said 
mcreynolds said basic service fees have increased by about 
onethird since deregulation because those fees had been set by 
local officials other special services which were never 
regulated have seen only slight increases and in some cases 
decreases since december 1986 she said 
the bureau of labor statistics said overall cable fees increased 
by 66 percent in the first year of deregulation and 79 percent 
last year according to mcreynolds 
industry representatives also argue that cable tv is a luxury 
that consumers can choose to buy and therefore should not be 
regulated like power companies 
wed like to get to the point that were a necessity but 
were still a long way from that mcreynolds said 
the lawmakers however argued that cable tv has become more and 
more of a necessity as cable companies buy up rights to sporting 
events and other programming that previously was available on 
traditional commercial television 
its become an essential part of our lives said shays 
lieberman said many americans especially the elderly rely 
heavily on cable programs for their news entertainment and even 
shopping he called cable a psychological necessity 
the bill would allow local governments to set cable rates 
require 60day notices for service changes and allow regulators to 
adjust rates as a result of any changes the measure also seeks to 
limit concentration of ownership and encourage cable systems to 
provide local stations 
the issue of reregulating the cable industry emerged in 
congress last year during hearings held by sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio but lieberman and shays are unsure of their prospects for 
success in this session 
most legislators would like this issue to go away said 
shays pointing to the conflict between consumer interests and a 
wellfinanced industry 
mcreynolds urged congress to hold off on any action until the 
federal communications commission submits a report at the end of 
1990 analyzing the impact of cable deregulation 
nearly 55 percent of all tv households in the nation get cable 
television

president bushs plan to rescue the sampl 
industry faces potential challenges from two powerful house 
committee chairmen after receiving a strong vote of support from 
the banking panel 
the house banking committee capped four days of debate by 
approving the plan on a 492 vote tuesday minutes before midnight 
the senate had passed its own version of the bill last week 
the legislation provides 157 billion over the next decade most 
of it from taxpayers to close or merge more than 500 failed 
institutions 
it also would put sampl regulators under more direct 
administration control increase spending to uncover fraud at sampls 
and in the key reform require sampl owners to risk more of their 
own capital when they make loans 
the bush administration is particularly pleased with the house 
bills capital provisions and is calling for congress to swiftly 
complete the legislative process and put a finished bill on the 
presidents desk 
the risk now is delay said assistant treasury secretary 
david w mullins one of the architects of the bush plan the bill 
has gone through so far without major changes if someone 
wanted to tinker with major components we would argue that would 
be unwarranted and very costly 
in a statement treasury secretary nicholas brady indicated the 
administration would be working to modify some provisions of the 
bill passed by the house banking committee before the measure 
clears congress 
brady singled out changes in the administrations proposals for 
setting up the resolution trust corp a new federal agency to 
dispose of repossessed assets of insolvent sampls including a 
provision which would require that some of the property be sold to 
lowincome people at a discount 
we do have serious concerns about the nature and direction of 
amendments which reconfigure the resoution trust corp the 
committee has made substantial modifications which alter the 
original design and intent of the administration proposal brady 
said we are particularly concerned about provisions that would 
divert resources needed for savings and loan resolutions to housing 
subsidies 
staff aides to the banking committee are expected to take until 
the end of next week to put the panels bill in proper form and 
write a report accompanying the legislation other committees with 
an interest in parts of the measure would then get a week to 
produce alternatives leaving a slim chance that the full house 
would before memorial day 
administration officials are also happy that both the senate and 
house so far have stuck with bushs complicated mechanism for 
keeping 50 billion in sampl spending out of the budget deficit 
however both rep dan rostenkowski dill the house ways and 
means committee chairman and rep claude pepper dfla the 
chairman of the rules committee disagree with major provisions of 
the bill 
rostenkowski in a speech last month said he believes the bush 
financing mechanism wastes about 150 million a year because it 
inflates the governments borrowing costs 
hes being urged by rep charles schumer dny a member of 
the banking committee to pursue the issue by including the sampl 
spending in the budget deficit but exempting it from the automatic 
cuts under grammrudman 
if nothing else rostenkowski can push it and back off and 
collect a few chits from the administration said an industry 
lobbyist who spoke on condition of anonymity hes got absolutely 
nothing to lose it makes him a player on a very important issue 
pepper whose panel governs debate on the house floor is 
pushing for looser capital rules arguing that it is unfair to take 
away accounting breaks given to sampls in the early 1980s in exchange 
for their takeover of ailing institutions 
the legislation requires sampl owners to risk 3 of real money 
or tangible capital for every 100 they lend double the 
requirement of the bill passed by the senate last month the 
capital would act as a buffer to absorb losses before government 
deposit insurance kicks in 
pepper is likely to insist that the full house get a chance to 
reconsider the capital provisions

corporate directors will be able to use a 
poison pill to ward off unwanted takeover bids in new york 
under a bill signed into law wednesday by gov mario cuomo 
companies in other states can enact a poison pill or 
antitakeover plan on their own but legislation was needed in new 
york because of a court decision last year that barred companies 
from treating the shares of a wouldbe acquirer different from 
those of other shareholders 
the state had given that power to directors but it expired 
april 1 
the new law gives boards of directors facing a hostile takeover 
a chance to buy time to evaluate and react to the offers by using 
a poison pill those directors could make it more expensive for an 
outsider to buy a controlling portion of stock 
at the same time most poison pills allow stockholders of the 
company to buy more shares at a cheaper price 
the new law takes effect immediately and expires july 1 between 
now and then cuomo and the legislature are expected to work on 
some sort of permanent poison pill measure 
poison pills generally have been supported by management and 
fortune 500 companies while they largely have been opposed by the 
securities industry and takeover entrepreneurs 
passage of this bill removes an incentive for people to leave 
new york said robert ward spokesman for the business council 
the states largest business lobbying group 
the bill was approved unanimously in the democraticcontrolled 
state assembly earlier wednesday

an illinois wastedisposal company 
shipped a barge containing toxic levels of lead and cadmium 
overseas without required government approval and the us 
government has proposed a 51750 fine 
triangle metallurgical inc of granite city which failed to get 
spains permission to export the material is the first company hit 
with a fine under 1986 hazardouswaste export laws the st louis 
postdispatch reported wednesday 
us epa is committed to ensuring that this countrys 
hazardous waste problems are not simply relocated to other 
countries said epa regional administrator valdus v adamkus who 
also proposed a 12700 fine against beelman truck co of st 
libory which is accused of accepting the shipment without proper 
documentation 
the triangle shipment to spain was one of thousands last year by 
businesses seeking to avoid the expense of complying with us 
hazardouswaste laws the postdispatch reported 
but for triangle the matter did not end when the ship 
containing its wastes docked this year in bilbao spain 
under us law toxicwaste exporters must notify the epa and 
working through the state department gain approval from the 
importing nation before shipment 
in triangles case the company notified the epa but the ship 
set sail before spanish approval was granted the postdispatch 
said 
triangle president william t wegryzn acknowledged the materials 
were not shipped with spains approval but said he believed 
notifying the epa was sufficient 
the materials were not highly toxic chemical wastes said 
officials of the company which takes metal wastes from steel 
mills foundries and smelters and then resells them 
on dec 28 about 750 cubic yards of metal waste and 
contaminated dirt from a 1984 triangle warehouse fire was trucked 
to a barge on the mississippi river and sent to europe the 
newspaper said 
the ship containing the waste arrived in bilbao spain on feb 
11 and the waste was trucked to er cosa a company that reclaims 
copper 
er cosa official jose antonio boveda said government approval 
was not required in spain to receive the shipment he characterized 
as routine 
the law requiring approval of the receiving nation went into 
effect in november 1986 the first us step to address concerns 
about toxic exports heavy fines and even jail sentences can be 
imposed for willful violations

japans trade minister told us officials 
tuesday his government plans to open transpacific hotlines to help 
american enterprises boost exports to his country a japanese 
official reported 
hiroshi mitsuzuka minister of international trade and industry 
informed commerce secretary edward mosbacher of the project said 
japanese embassy spokesman shingo yamagami 
under the plan us exporters or potential exporters would be 
invited to call in questions problems or complaints directly to 
the tokyo miti ministry overseer of the countrys global trade 
using circuits available at japanese government commercial offices 
in new york los angeles and three other us cities he said 
complaints of japanese import barriers and other red tape are a 
major source of trade friction between the two countries 
aggravated by a us trade deficit with japan last year of 52 
billion which after a modest drop is again rising 
details such as whether the hotlines would be for voice 
conversation or data exchange were not yet available the spokesman 
said there was no immediate us reaction 
japan south korea and other countries enjoying large trade 
surpluses with america are lobbying vigorously to avoid being 
targeted by the end of this month for potential retaliation under 
1988 us trade legislation 
in another development us secretary of state james baker iii 
was quoted by a japanese official as warning mitsuzuka that rising 
us protectionist pressure will increase tension between the 
united states and japan challenging the two countries to manage 
their relations more effectively in the coming years 
hideo muraoka deputy miti minister briefing japanese 
reporters added that baker was optimistic that effective and 
proper management will be possible 
three ministers of japanese prime minister noboru takeshitas

the house banking committee on tuesday voted 
492 approval of president bushs proposal to spend 157 billion 
over 10 years to bail out the savings and loan industry from what 
has been described as the worst financial crisis since the 
depression 
the bill also would put sampl regulators under more direct 
administration control spend 75 million a year on investigating 
and prosecuting fraud at sampls and in the key reform require sampl 
owners to risk more of their own money when they make loans 
the only dissenting votes cast just before midnight after a 
14hour session were from reps joseph kennedy dmass and jim 
leach riowa kennedy said he would have preferred the bill to 
provide more housing help for poor people and antidiscrimination 
provisions leach said he wanted tougher capital standards 
the legislation requires sampl owners to risk 3 of real money 
or tangible capital for every 100 they lend double the 
requirement of the bill passed by the senate last month the 
capital would act as a buffer to absorb losses before government 
deposit insurance kicks in 
david w mullins assistant secretary of the treasury and one of 
the bush proposals architects praised the bill saying this 
committee exceeded everyones expectations despite all the 
criticism of the bush plan the plain fact is its gone through 
pretty much intact 
this is a good bill we all have reason to be proud 
said rep henry b gonzalez dtexas the committees chairman 
we will move this bill on the fast track as fast as house rules 
allow 
after the banking panel completes its report on the bill 
probably by the end of next week at least two other committees 
ways and means and judiciary will have one week to review 
sections within their jurisdiction 
then depending on how long the full house devotes to debate and 
action a joint housesenate conference committee could resolve 
differences between the two chambers and put the bill on the 
presidents desk by the july 4 recess five months after bush made 
his proposal 
the administration has endorsed the capital provisions of the 
house bill but rep claude pepper dfla chairman of the rules 
committee is objecting arguing it is unfair to take away capital 
breaks given to sampls in the early 1980s in exchange for their 
takeover of ailing institutions 
peppers committee sets the rules governing debate on the house 
floor and committee members and their aides said they expect he 
will insist the full house get the chance to amend the capital 
standards 
most of the cost of the bailout will be born by taxpayers the 
rest by the sampl industry however 50 billion of the spending in 
the next three years will be excluded from the budget deficit 
through a complicated plan for borrowing the money helping bush 
meet his no new taxes pledge 
two provisions in the house legislation not adopted by the 
senate are aimed at helping poor people obtain housing one 
offered by rep barney frank dmass and adopted 3318 requires 
the new government agency that will liquidate failed sampls the 
resolution trust corp to offer poor people and nonprofit groups 
at least a threemonth option to buy lowpriced residential 
properties owned by failed sampls 
two republicans joined the 31 democrats on the panel in passing 
the amendment the 18 republicans opposing it argued that franks 
proposal would dangerously restrict the governments ability to 
sell property from failed sampls open the government to lawsuits and 
eventually add to the taxpayer cost of the bailout 
frank however said his plan affected only 2 billion to 3 
billion of the 200 billion to 300 billion in real estate the 
government will inherit from sick institutions and argued that it 
was a modest way to channel a few of the benefits of the massive 
sampl bill to the public 
a provision offered by gonzalez and adopted last week requires 
the sampl industry through the regional federal home loan banks to 
provide 75 million a year to pay for reducedrate mortgages for 
poor people 
however the house panel on tuesday defeated a pair of 
amendments aimed at encouraging banks to do a better job of serving 
poor people and minorities 
on a 2723 vote with seven democrats joining all 20 republicans 
the panel rejected an amendment by gonzalez and kennedy that would 
have forced banks and sampls to publicly disclose federal regulators 
ratings on how well they serve poor and minorities neighborhoods 
by a 3021 vote with 10 democrats joining 20 republicans it 
voted against an amendment requiring regulators to report 
information on mortgage lending by race age and gender 
if you think for a second that discrimination doesnt exist in 
financial institutions then we are living in disney world because 
it happens every day said rep robert garcia dny 
opponents said public disclosure of ratings kept by banking 
regulators would be misinterpreted by depositors and used by civil 
rights and community groups to create mischief 
in other action tuesday the house committee 
expanded the board overseeing the resolution trust corp from 
three members to five members including housing and urban 
development secretary jack kemp and a private real estate expert 
bush had wanted a threemember board headed by treasury 
secretary nicholas brady and including attorney general dick 
thornburgh and federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
the committee also added federal deposit insurance corp 
chairman l william seidman as a nonvoting member he likely will 
be in charge of the daytoday task of administering the cleanup 
voted 3316 to adopt an amendment by rep toby roth rwis to 
require banks and sampls with assets of more than 150 million to 
obtain independent audits of their financial condition 
defeated 2623 an amendment by rep charles schumer dny 
that would have permitted regulators to revoke special accounting 
breaks granted to acquirors of failed sampls in 1988
