share prices dipped on the tokyo stock exchange on 
saturday and dealers said investors were worried about market 
uncertainties 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues lost 6285 
points or 023 percent during the halfday session closing the 
week at 2733857 
traders linked the decline to the yens rise overnight on 
overseas currency markets 
the appreciation of the yen is making investors wary about the 
future of the market said a broker at a major securities firm 
speaking on condition of anonymity most electronic shares and 
other exportoriented shares were lower today because of the strong 
yen 
steel and shipbuilding industry shares which led the market 
during the week moved lower because of heavy profittaking 
traders said 
volume traded on the exchanges first section where most major 
shares are listed was a moderate 450 million shares 
stock prices were volatile during the week because of mixed 
incentives in the market while volume showed signs of recovering 
from a monthlong slump the nikkei index rose on four days and 
declined on two days during the week and ended the six days with a 
32point gain 
gains on the new york stock exchange where the dowjones 
industrial average reached a postcrash high and the untroubled 
passage of the first anniversary of the worldwide stock market 
crash encouraged investors analysts said 
but the continuing illness of emperor hirohito and the rapid 
upsurge of the yen against the dollar dragged share prices down 
they said analysts also said uncertainty over oil prices was a 
discouraging factor in the market 
the tokyo stock exchange is open for a halfday session on 
saturdays except for the second and third saturdays of each month 
but the tokyo currency market is closed on weekends

centrists run the national 
administration and rightists dominate the legislature but the 
radical left has gained control of el salvadors leading university 
during nine years of civil war 
portraits of che guevara and farabundo marti the revolutionist 
for whom the marxistled guerrilla army is named gaze from campus 
walls at students moving between classes at the university of el 
salvador 
long live the people up in arms is written across the 
school of humanities facade leftist folk songs boom over the 
public address system 
conservative groups in el salvador a nation of 55 million 
paople about the size of massachusetts say the 35000member 
student body has become a fifth column of subversives 
some students teachers and alumni contend however that 
radical student unions do not represent the majority 
like nearly all national universities in latin america el 
salvadors is financed by the state but remains autonomous the 
government has virtually nothing to do with its administration 
police and soldiers are forbidden by law from entering the 
grounds but that did not prevent a militarydominated regime from 
invading the school in 1980 and shutting it down for four years 
when president jose napoleon duarte a christian democrat 
visited the campus last year to inspect damage done by a severe 
earthquake catcalls and shouted insults drowned out his attempts 
to speak 
if we examine the institutions that identify with the needs 
and aspirations of the salvadoran people we find they are all 
politicized because we are in the middle of a war said luis 
argueta antillon a leftist economist who is the universitys 
rector 
these institutions cannot withdraw themselves from that war 
no one can remain neutral he told an interviewer in his office 
a conservative alumni group alleged in paid announcements 
published last month that the standard bearers of terrorism had 
taken over the student body with the object of fomenting social 
disorder 
student unions use demonstrations for increased government 
spending on education as a pretext for acts of terrorism in the 
streets the ads said 
among about 3000 students in a march for more funds sept 13 
were 200 with bandannas over their faces carrying iron staves or 
nailstudded wooden clubs the military says some masked marchers 
are guerrilla urban commandos 
that march ended in a melee of tear gas and flailing clubs when 
300 riot troopers moved in on the demonstrators the driver of a 
police truck was killed allegedly shot by a marcher 
about 250 people were arrested and 14 charged with subversive 
affiliation all eventually were released for lack of evidence 
argueta said security forces frustrated at release by the courts 
of people they consider subversive might resort to kidnapping and 
murder to quell student action 
two young men carrying books entered a university cafeteria oct 
3 walked up to custodian raul escamilla drew pistols and shot him 
to death a university statement called the killing part of a 
government and military campaign against the university 
escamilla 34 was arrested by the national police and held for 
several days last year on suspicion of affiliation with the 
farabundo marti national liberation front 
eli ruiz a journalism professor worries about the effect of 
radical activism on academic standards 
the effort to keep classes from politicizing is constant 
ruiz said and he tries to teach according to scientific 
criteria but because of the context of conflict that is very 
difficult 
the rector arqueta contends we cannot think in terms of 
academic level for its own sake 
he said medical school graduates had enjoyed success in north 
america and europe a testament to their training but the fact 
we turned out good doctors did not lower our infant mortality rate 
or provide better conditions of public health or increase life 
expectancy 
argueta is presiding over a revision of the rules to require 
that future graduates contribute 500 hours of social service in 
their fields 
asked why no centrist or rightist student union had been formed 
he noted that 75 percent of students were from families of workers 
or peasants while the expressions of the center and the right are 
minority expressions 
realizing they are in the minority they dont want to get 
into an open confrontation of ideas he said of students from the 
political center and right 
one student speaking privately said conservatives on campus 
are intimidated by the radical minority 
when they come into a lecture hall and announce that class is 
suspended for a march or a sitin maybe three or four out of 80 
take part in the activity she said 
many conservative students express their opinions on lavatory 
walls a tour turned up condemnations of the guerrillas and leftist 
student unions generally unprintable and vivas for ronald 
reagan and roberto daubuisson 
daubuisson leads the rightist arena party which won control of 
the legislature this year and is said to have headed rightist 
death squads accused of killing thousands of alleged leftists in 
the early 1980s

biongue looks like any other african bush 
village at first grass huts cooking fires children running 
barefoot among squawking chickens 
a second look reveals its ghastly harvest from 13 years of civil 
war crutches stacked near a mound of cornmeal women with wooden 
legs the slow and awkward movements of the maimed 
more than half the 3500 residents have lost at least one arm or 
leg most of the victims 500 civilians and 1300 former guerrilla 
fighters were wounded by mines 
i stepped on a mine coming in from a field after soldiers 
raided our place two years ago and killed my husband said teresa 
felina who lost both feet it took her five months to reach 
biongue in guerrilla territory of southeastern angola from her 
home near huambo in the central highlands 
her story is typical tens of thousands of angolans are believed 
to have been killed or wounded by antipersonnel mines which are 
buried in the sandy soil and are set off by a footstep 
it has been a slow and cautious war since angolas independence 
from portugal in 1975 commanders on both sides are reluctant to 
mount large assaults that might gain objectives quickly but would 
cost many casualties 
they capture lose and recapture rivers hills and towns both 
sides plant huge numbers of mines indiscriminate weapons that may 
remain undetected for years until detonated by the random step of a 
man woman or child 
an example is cuito cuanavale a major battleground of the past 
year 
guerrillas of the ussupported national union for the total 
independence of angola unita say army brigades supported by cuban 
troops mined the southern town heavily before retreating from it 
early in 1988 
jonas savimbis unita forces were pushed out of cuito later but 
the guerrillas claim the army cannot reenter the town until it 
conducts the difficult and dangerous operations of disarming the 
mines 
biongue visited during a tour of unita camps this month is in 
the southeastern corner of angola an hours drive from jamba the 
guerrilla headquarters it was built in 1983 and unita says it is 
one of four rehabilitation established for people crippled in the 
war 
men in a workshop chiseled artificial legs from blocks of wood 
held by vises homemade wooden wheelchairs stood in a row outside 
physiotherapist chantal cluset 23 of montpellier france 
worked nearby with several men who suffered paralysis numbness and 
blurred vision after a skirmish last year near cuemba on the 
benguela railroad in central angola 
they say it happened after a chemical attack she said we 
have no proof 
ms cluset who later left angola spent nine months with unita 
on behalf of a french group called handicap international 
lt sousa chipeio a guerrilla liaison officer said the maimed 
were trained in skills that could make them selfsupporting he 
said they could function as teachers nurses or clerical workers 
but it would be difficult for them to continue as farmers 
jonatao muco 23 lost a leg while fighting near canage in 
eastern angola last year he sat on a log bench his crutches 
tucked under him and said he was studying in the third grade of 
primary school while waiting for a wooden leg 
col jaka jamba unitas education secretary said at guerrilla 
headquarters 
we pay special attention to getting the wounded back into 
normal life while they need it unita provides clothing and food 
there is a secondary school at biongue and we plan a vocational 
school the aim is to get them into jobs

restricting news coverage is a favorite weapon of 
governments battling those they regard as terrorists 
now britain with a ban on broadcast interviews of its foes in 
northern ireland has joined the list 
prime minister margaret thatchers government on wednesday 
slapped an immediate ban on broadcast interviews with 11 
paramilitary and political groups involved in the northern ireland 
conflict including the outlawed irish republican army 
the ban raised criticism that it was similar to measures taken 
in south africa but foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe dismissed 
it 
we must refute that argument as far as possible he said 
from spain where he is accompanying queen elizabeth ii on a state 
visit what we are doing against terrorism in our own society is 
exactly the same as the government of ireland has done 
british news organizations and civil rights groups also cried 
censorship but the government said it had to act to curb a recent 
surge in ira violence 
the british broadcasting corp called it a damaging 
precedent and the national union of journalists said step by 
step the freedom of broadcasting is being removed 
a statement by the international press institute said the ban is 
a serious erosion of the basic freedom of the media to gather and 
present news and information from every source and peoples freedom 
and right to judge for themselves the institute is based in 
london and claims a membership of 2000 journalists 
the ban is similar to one imposed on the irish state 
broadcasting system 15 years ago to combat the mainly roman 
catholic ira which is fighting to end british rule in the 
predominantly protestant northern ireland 
but it still allows broadcasters to paraphrase statements over 
film of the speaker and does not affect newspapers or foreign 
broadcasters so its net is not as wide as some cast elsewhere 
south africa for example prohibits broadcasters and newspapers 
from quoting scores of opposition figures and israel prohibits not 
only news media interviews but any contact by israelis with the 
palestine liberation organization 
the south african ban applies not only to leaders of the 
outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement but also 
many officials of groups committed to nonviolence a june 1986 
stateofemergency declaration also restricts reporting about 
unrest security force action and various subversive statements 
enforcement of the regulations has been haphazard and neither 
local nor foreign journalists observe them rigorously two 
antiapartheid newspapers were closed for threemonth periods for 
allegedly violating the regulations and others have been warned 
but the newspapers have resumed publication and no individual 
journalists have been prosecuted for violating the regulations 
in israel a 1986 law bars citizens from meeting any members of 
terrorist organizations this effectively bans contacts with the 
plo which israel considers to be a terrorist group 
in june four israelis became the first to be convicted and 
sentenced under this law they were each sentenced to six months in 
prison and fined 2500 for meeting plo representatives in romania 
two years ago 
israels stateowned television and radio do not permit 
interviews with plo leaders this week israels central elections 
committee censored an interview with plo chief yasser arafat from 
an election campaign ad of a leftwing jewisharab party called the 
progressive movement for peace 
under a 1983 law in turkey a newspaper editor and prominent 
columnist went n trial last month for publishing a story based on 
an interview with abdullah ocalan leader of the illegal kurdish 
labor party the party has been fighting government troops since 
1984 to establish a marxist state in parts of eastern and 
southeastern turkey 
istanbul daily milliyets foreign correspondant mehmet ali 
birand and managing editor eren guvener were charged with 
publishing material that weakened nationalist feelings and with 
publishing the views of a criminal 
it was the first time turkeys press laws had been used since 
they were adopted by the former military regime 
in spain the basque separatist organization eta is proscribed 
and their most important leaders are either hiding in france or 
underground in spain 
a 1984 law makes it an offense to support or praise the 
activities of terrorists through the mass media although the 
courts have thrown out most cases brought by prosecutors the 
basque newspaper egin continues to print communiques from eta 
and is in turn quoted by the spanish national news agency efe and 
private and public broadcasters 
in portugal a court in february acquitted four reporters for 
the stateowned television network radiotelevisao portuguesa of 
charges they alarmed and upset the public by broadcasting a 
news conference given by hooded members of a leftist terrorist 
group 
the judge also acquitted the news team of personally 
favoring the group known as the popular forces of april 25 
named for the date of portugals 1974 leftist military coup by 
broadcasting the movements news conference 
the judge ruled that the reporters had acted only and 
exclusively with the aim of informing the public in the december 
1985 broadcast and said the television footage aided 
identification of one of the hooded spokesman at a subsequent trail 
membership in a proscribed organization is a criminal offense in 
kenya and such groups have no access to stateowned and controlled 
radio and television 
france has no ban on interviews with members of proscribed 
organizations and occasionally there are broadcasts with members of 
the outlawed corsican national liberation front or basque 
separatists 
west german officials oppose interviews with members of 
organizations such as red army faction but members of such groups 
have been interviewed during leaves from prison for example

the war of words to make english the 
official language in three states wont be settled until election 
day but it has already prompted lawsuits and the resignations of 
key proponents including walter cronkite 
arizona and colorado voters will get to decide the issue nov 8 
its also on the ballot in florida but a lawsuit seeks to remove it 
because petitions in the citizens initiative werent circulated in 
spanish in six of the states 67 counties a federal judge in miami 
has yet to rule on the suit 
fourteen states have passed laws designating english their 
official language only california has a constitutional amendment 
approved in 1986 arizona florida and colorado also are 
considering amendments which would if approved be harder to 
change or repeal than a law 
colorados proposed amendment 1 would declare that the english 
language is the official language of the state of colorado 
arizonas proposition 106 would require state and county 
governments to conduct all business in english with certain 
exceptions in the areas of education public health and safety the 
justice system and federal election law 
floridas amendment 11 would designate english the states 
official language and give the legislature authority to pass laws 
enforcing that status 
both sides say the stakes are especially high in florida 
we want to turn the heat on this one and try to slow it 
down said jeff browne statewide coordinator of speak up now for 
florida which opposes the amendment if it passes in florida i 
think it makes texas which is the next target state more likely 
to pass this type of law 
browne contends that english is already the de facto official 
language of both florida and the country and that the proposed 
amendment could threaten fundamental liberties 
the framers of the us constitution had the opportunity to 
declare an official language brown said they chose not to 
they felt this was an area the government ought to stay out of in 
200 years they were proved right 
pat fulton a spokeswoman for florida english which supports 
the amendment agrees that florida has become a bellwether 
state 
browne said he thinks colorado and arizona voters will pass the 
measures and conceded it will be hard to stop the florida 
amendment if it survives the court challenge 
but both sides of the official english battle have suffered 
setbacks this month 
on oct 12 a federal appeals court cleared the way for the 
colorado measure to appear on november ballots ruling against a 
lawsuit which argued that the federal voting rights act of 1965 
required election material to be provided in spanish in certain 
areas of the state 
the pending florida suit filed on behalf of four dade county 
spanishspeaking residents makes a similar argument 
in an action growing out of the campaigns former cbs anchorman 
cronkite resigned on oct 13 from the advisory board of us 
english a group founded in 1983 by john tanton and former sen 
si hayakawa of california to promote a us constitutional 
amendment 
cronkite said he believed the arizona proposal could hurt 
minorities though he said he remains opposed to bilingualism 
on monday linda chavez a former white house aide during the 
reagan administration resigned as president of us english 
citing a report that at least one major contributor to the group 
has advocated forced sterilization she did not elaborate 
that same day us english cofounder tanton resigned both 
cronkite and ms chavez had expressed concern over a 1986 memo 
tanton wrote suggesting that too many recent immigrants have been 
roman catholics and that hispanics bring with them a trend toward 
corruption 
ms chavez who said she still supported the idea behind us 
english told tallahassee business leaders last month that there is 
a difference in whats being expected of new immigrants 
only in the last 20 years or so have we seen a dramatic shift 
in terms of the attitude about that integration she said citing 
the expansion of bilingual education from a 75 million program in 
1968 to 750 million now

the exclusion of religion from public school 
curricula is hurting the education of americas children according 
to a group promoting instruction about religion without advocacy of 
any particular faith 
for far too long weve had a remarkable silence on teaching 
about religion in the nations public schools ernest l boyer of 
the williamsburg charter foundation school curriculum project said 
thursday 
the foundation is a nonprofit nonpartisan organization that 
seeks to foster public awareness about the first amendment 
religious liberty clauses in the constitution and reaffirm freedom 
for people of all faiths or none in america 
the failure to include systematically the study of religion in 
the school curriculum has reduced the quality of the education we 
are providing to our children said boyer 
boyer former us commissioner of education from 1977 to 1979 
said students cannot know the history of music art or literature 
without understanding the intensity of religious faith throughout 
all of history 
the silence often stems from a fear of violating supreme court 
rulings against statesponsored school prayer and bible reading 
said boyer who is president of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching 
henry c johnson jr of pennsylvania state university who will 
oversee production of materials for a fivelesson program targeted 
at fifth eighth and eleventh graders said the goal is not to 
advocate any particular faith 
but he said an understanding of the place of religion in history 
is essential for students to understand historical developments 
how will they understand how the average 19th century european 
thought about the catholic church unless you tell them about the 
religion religious information and study is different from 
instruction in religious values he said 
in addition to a teachers manual the group plans to produce 
historical and contemporary documentaries videotapes and materials 
for art literature and drama instruction 
johnson said the program which is being developed by a national 
board of educators and evaluated by a crosssection of religious 
leaders will be published next spring pilot projects for the 
course are scheduled to begin in the 198990 school year in several 
states

military president augusto pinochet 
changed half of his cabinet and flatly ruled out an early departure 
from power rejecting a demand by the opposition parties that 
defeated him in the oct 5 referendum 
speaking at a ceremony in which he swore in the new ministers 
friday pinochet also for the first time appeared to rule out his 
candidacy in a competitive presidential election next year 
i will hand over my post to the person that citizens elect 
freely secretly and in an informed fashion on dec 14 1989 the 
election date the 72yearold president and army commander said 
although most legal experts say the constitution bars him from 
running in the election and succeeding himself there has been open 
speculation including by highranking government officials that 
he might seek a legal loophole 
the constitution calls for his term to end in march 1990 when 
he will be succeeded by the winner of the december 1989 election 
pinochet brought in eight new ministers all civilians to his 
16man cabinet and shifted one to a different ministry he kept 
seven others including some military officers 
in the most most important change he named carlos caceres a 
48yearold useducated economist to replace sergio fernandez as 
interior minister by far the most potentially politically powerful 
post in the cabinet 
the opposition and even some progovernment politicians had 
called for the removal of fernandez who had firmly rejected 
opposition demands for negotiations on democratic reforms of the 
8yearold constitution drawn up under pinochet 
in his speech pinochet flatly rejected the opposition demands 
saying sirs the constitution will not be modified this issue 
is not at stake 
the opposition claims its victory in the referendum in which 
pinochet sought to extend his rule until 1997 showed that voters 
want to speed up transition to democracy and the presidents 
departure from power 
in the referendum a simple yes or no ballot 39 million people 
voted against pinochets continued rule and 31 million voted in 
favor pinochet took power in a 1973 coup that deposed the elected 
government of salvador allende a marxist who died in the coup 
opposition leaders seemed unworried by pinochets firm rejection 
of their demands 
jorge burgos assistant secretarygeneral of the christian 
democratic party the countrys largest said of pinochets speech 
sometimes words can be changed by deeds 
caceres did not rule out a dialogue with the opposition let 
me analyze think about and study this issue and then well 
talk he told reporters 
should the government finally agree to negotiating with the 
opposition caceres would the key man in the talks 
caceres a technocrat who served briefly as finance minister in 
the early 1980s is widely considered more moderate than his 
predecessor fernandez he is also considered to be especially 
close to pinochet he handled the finances of the presidents 
campaign in the referendum 
in other important cabinet changes pinochet brought his 
ambassador to washington hernan felipe errazuriz 43 to replace 
ricardo garcia as foreign minister miguel angel poduje was moved 
from the housing ministry to replace orlando poblete as government 
secretarygeneral a key post roughly equivalent to a chief of 
staff 
pinochet kept finance minister hernan buchi 39 a columbia 
universitygraduated engineer who is widely credited with the 
successful performance of the economy in recent years 
also confirmed in their posts were patricio carvajal as defense 
minister army gen manuel concha economy juan antonio guzman 
education hugo rosende justice army gen bruno siebert public

legislation providing up to 13 billion in 
assistance to the nations homeless is now on president reagans 
desk awaiting his decision on whether to sign it into law 
the bill was sent to reagan following a voice vote in the senate 
on thursday both presidential candidates republican george bush 
and democrat michael dukakis have praised the legislation with 
dukakis calling for increased spending 
the bill allows the federal government to provide money to 
states municipalities and private agencies for rental assistance 
health care mental health services alcohol and drug abuse 
programs education and job training projects 
money also would be available for the purchase and 
rehabilitation of group homes in addition unused space at 
veterans administration hospitals would be set aside for the 
treatment of homeless veterans 
the legislation authorizes spending of 6338 million for fiscal 
1989 which began oct 1 and 6828 million in fiscal 1990 
however congress has only appropriated 378 million for this 
fiscal year and 3605 million in fiscal 1990 
democrats praised the bill but urged congress to spend more of 
the money the bill authorizes 
sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the senate housing 
subcommittee said passage of the bill demonstrates that while 
progress has been made on housing issues we still have a long way 
to go 
while the bill addresses the housing health and mental health 
needs of homeless persons the only true solution will come with a 
national affordable housing act cranston said 
it is encouraging that this homeless legislation enjoys such 
broad support said sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of 
the senate labor and human resources committee perhaps with such 
broadbased support we will be able to secure the appropriations 
needed to fully fund this legislation in the coming years 
advocates for the nations homeless population estimated at 
between 250000 and 3 million people have complained that 
congress has yet to provide all of the money authorized in the bill 
the measure is named for the late rep stewart b mckinney 
rconn one of its original sponsors who died in may 1987 less 
than three months after the legislation became law

agriculture department economists are sticking 
to their guns that farmers net cash income this year despite 
cropgobbling drought could match or exceed last years record of 
571 billion nationally 
the latest forecast released thursday by the departments 
economic research service is unchanged from one issued in 
september 
economists said higher commodity prices inventory drawdowns and 
only moderate decreases in government subsidies are the main 
reasons for forecasting 1988 net cash income in a range of 55 
billion to 60 billion 
however the fortunes of individual farmers have changed 
sharply some gaining from higher prices received and others losing 
from heavy crop losses or higher feed costs the agency said in 
its new outlook report 
net cash income is the amount of money farmers have to spend 
during the year and represents the difference between gross cash 
income and cash expenses for example 1988 sales of grain stored 
from harvests in earlier years are counted as part of the current 
gross 
another method of usda bookkeeping measures net farm income 
for the calendar year not simply the cashin cashout system 
involved in net cash income 
in this method changes in the value of farm inventories are 
taken into consideration and allowances are made for nonmoney 
items such as depreciation the family consumption of farmgrown 
food and the net rental value of dwellings 
net farm income in 1988 was forecast at 38 billion to 43 
billion also unchanged from the september report but down from 
1987s record 463 billion 
production of red meat and poultry is setting a record this 
year helped by increased slaughter in response to higher feed 
costs the report said production is led by a 9 percent 
increase in pork turkey broilers and milk are up moderately beef 
and eggs are down 
in 1989 with breeding stock reduced and downward pressure on 
producer returns the output of red meat and poultry is expected 
to decline about 1 percent from this years record level 
crop production is down 18 percent this year with most of the 
decline coming in feed grains which are down a third 
one measure of the droughts impact is the severe drawdown of 
us grain and oilseed inventories the report said despite 
acreage and yield increases likely next year most production for 
198990 will be consumed directly in the us and abroad not put 
into storage stocks

drought parasites and the march of 
africanized killer bees have contributed to a drop in world 
honey production says the agriculture department 
the departments foreign agricultural service said in a report 
on world trade that honey output in selected countries is forecast 
at 709500 metric tons in 1988 down 3 percent from a revised 
production of 730500 tons last year 
us honey output this year is forecast at about 85000 tons 
down 17 percent from 1987 because of poor flowering cause by 
drought 
canadas production is expected to drop 11 percent to 36000 
tons because of a canadian ban on imports of us bees because of 
infestations of parasitic varroa mites 
the ban caused a decline in the number of colonies from 
700000 in 1987 to 620000 in 1988 the report said western 
canada was affected the most by the ban 
mexicos honey production was forecast at 44000 tons down 8 
percent from last year because of dry conditions in the main 
producing areas also the report said the decline can be 
partially attributed to the africanization of some beehives in 
southern mexico 
the africanized bees have been migrating northward for years 
since some of the ferocious insects mingled with domestic breeds 
beekeepers in the united states have been apprehensive about the 
bees as they move north through mexico 
elsewhere the soviet unions honey production is expected to 
total 192000 tons up slightly from last year chinas output at 
200000 tons is down 2 percent

a halfinchlong weevil from argentina is the 
agriculture departments answer to snakeweed a poisonous weed that 
has plagued livestock ranchers in the southwest for generations 
c jack deloach an entomologist in the departments 
agricultural research service said about 800 of the weevils have 
been released experimentally in new mexico and texas 
the insects were released this summer near socorro and las 
cruces nm and fort stockton and andrews texas some were 
confined to net cages while others were turned loose in the open 
deloach who works at the agencys laboratory in temple texas 
said in a report released here that usda scientists learned of the 
weevils in the late 1970s several thousand were collected in 
argentina and tested on about 30 plants related to snakeweed it 
turned out that snakeweed was their favorite diet 
the tests will require four or five years before there are 
definite results he said the weevils are found naturally only in 
argentina and paraguay 
snakeweed was an uncommon plant 150 years ago but has spread to 
142 million acres in the western united states and causes an 
estimated 70 million to 140 million in losses annually mainly in 
aborted calves deloach said

time is running out on a tax bill that has 
been awaiting action for more than two years as congress inches 
toward adjournment for the year 
well need a miracle to pass a tax bill this year said sen 
max baucus dmont who has been managing the measure for the 
senate however its never over until its over he added 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas another member of 
the senate team trying to negotiate a compromise with the house 
said there was less than a 50 percent chance of getting a bill one 
house aide who would not be quoted by name said there was only 
one chance in 10 
theres still a pulse but the odds are against resolution of 
the impasse said rep bill archer of texas chief republican 
negotiator for the house 
after a week of deadlock senior staff members from the tax 
committees suggested a compromise with a threeyear price tag of 
about 4 billion that is higher than senators had favored but 
less than backed by the house 
baucus calls this a serious proposal and one that the senate 
should consider seriously said spokesman bill maddox 
congress hopes to adjourn tonight or saturday and many members 
of congress including some who were named to negotiate a 
compromise tax bill already have left town 
the tax bill originally was written in the fall of 1986 
immediately after congress completed work on a thorough overhaul of 
the income tax the original purpose of the bill was to clean up 
errors and clear up uncertainties in that huge bill 
efforts to pass it failed in 1986 and 1987 and as it awaited 
final action it picked up dozens of unrelated amendments most of 
which were designed to provide a targeted new tax benefit or extend 
an old one and to raise other taxes enough to finance those 
benefits 
the senate attached to the package this year a taxpayers bill 
of rights designed to increase the clout of those who are audited 
or face collections actions by the internal revenue service it 
would for example require the irs to inform a taxpayer fully of 
his or her rights before any action is begun and increase from 10 
days to 30 days the minimum waiting period before the irs can seize 
property for back taxes 
major provisions of the deadlocked legislation would free 
farmers from paying the federal fuel tax on diesel burned for 
offroad purposes allow certain livestock producers and freelance 
artists to deduct some operating expenses before a project 
generates income and renew an exclusion for employerfinanced 
educational assistance 
the version passed by the house would provide tax benefits worth 
about 75 billion over three years and raise other taxes to pay 
for those benefits the senate plan has a price tag of under 3 
billion 
the biggest point of contention between house and senate 
negotiators has been over the size of the compromise bill 
the house insisted that the final version be closer to its 
figure in order to finance longer extensions of certain expiring 
provisions such as a tax exemption for bonds issued to help 
lowincome families buy their first home 
the senate declined to go much beyond 3 billion for fear that 
president reagan would veto the bill as another exercise in raising 
taxes to pay for more spending 
senators and the reagan administration also object to two big 
revenueraisers in the house plan one would cost defense 
contractors and big construction companies about 24 billion by 
repealing a special method of accounting the other would reduce 
the dividendsreceived deduction used by many big corporations 
that would cost those companies about 18 billion over three years

congress has given final approval to two more 
bills providing new rights and benefits for veterans sending the 
measures to president reagan for his expected approval 
the bills grant veterans the right to have courts review denial 
of benefit decisions and provide a series of costofliving 
increases in a variety of va payments 
they were approved on a voice vote by the senate on thursday a 
day after similar action in the house 
earlier in the week congress sent reagan another bill to 
elevate the veterans administration to cabinet status making the 
agency the 14th cabinet department 
the review bill allows veterans to have federal courts review va 
denials of benefits for the first time it creates a new us 
court of veterans appeals to replace the current board of 
veterans appeals that panel is part of the va and is now the last 
resort of veterans who are unhappy with decisions to reject their 
claims 
the benefits increase legislation provides that 22 million 
veterans with serviceconnected disabilities and 310000 widows and 
orphans will receive the same 41 percent costofliving increases 
paid to social security recipients 
dropped from the final bill was an amendment added earlier by 
the senate that would have provided interim health care payments to 
some of the vietnam veterans who were exposed to agent orange a 
highly toxic defoliant used by the united states in southeast asia

two researchers of the john f kennedy 
assassination are urging a federal court to stop the son of the 
late abraham zapruder from selling the right to show his fathers 
famous film footage of the slaying 
a suit filed thursday in us district court argues that henry 
g zapruder a washington tax lawyer should not have a copyright 
claim to the 8mm film that captured for history the shooting of 
kennedy 25 years ago next month in dallas dealey plaza 
its a historical event and its far too important to american 
history to allow its use to be dictated by a copyright owner who 
has shown no sensitivity for its importance and for the uses which 
scholars and writers want to make of it said james h lesar an 
attorney and vice president of the assassination archives a 
private research group 
zapruder reached by telephone late thursday declined to answer 
specific questions about the suit but said the family only charges 
people who use the film for commercial purposes 
we make the film available free of charge to anyone who is not 
going to use it for commercial purposes and weve been doing that 
for years he said we do that because we think its the right 
thing to do people who are going to charge we charge 
the elder zapruder a dress manufacturer who died in 1970 had 
sold the film to life magazine for 150000 shortly after the 
assassination life featured dramatic frames from the footage in a 
special issue following the slaying 
in 1975 time inc sold the film back to the zapruder family for 
1 
the original 8mm film is in storage at the national archives 
but the zapruder family retains exclusive rights to the films use 
and copies henry zapruder according to the suit has been 
charging up to 30000 for the right to use the film footage

with little more than two weeks to go in a 
presidential campaign marked by a madefortv mentality michael 
dukakis is fighting back with a television blitz of his own hoping 
that a foray into americas living rooms will revive his candidacy 
the democratic nominee is making himself available to network 
and majormarket television outlets and also plans to buy tv time 
for direct appeals to voters a costly venture that is drawing 
mixed reviews from political analysts 
it may be too little too late but its certainly better than 
doing nothing said mark siegel a democratic consultant there 
is still a large segment of the population that is undecided and 
another segment that is recently decided and could be persuaded to 
change their mind this election is not over 
republicans not surprisingly disagree 
my guess is that people are not going to sit down and watch 
this stuff said gop consultant eddie mahe they have made 
their decision 
the dukakis campaign which is paying for some of the network 
time is counting on a large audience 
the american people are looking for a candidate to break 
across the soundbite barrier to talk to them about whats at 
stake said dukakis communications director leslie dach thats 
what we hope to do 
dach refused to discuss how much dukakis plans to spend on the 
effort which tentatively includes buying a half hour on each of 
the broadcast networks on the eve of the election and several 
shorter time slots beginning as early as this weekend the campaign 
also is considering less expensive purchases of television time in 
major markets in target states 
still unresolved is whether dukakis will take the high road in 
the nationally televised addresses or lash out at republican rival 
george bush campaign aides shy away from discussing that except 
to say dukakis will attempt to show that he is on the side of 
average americans and bush is not the central theme of the 
democrats speeches this week 
but it appears likely he will mix discussion of his proposals 
with salvos directed at bush a strategy endorsed by democrats and 
republicans alike 
the first order of business has to be to get george bush down 
in the polls and that means to me that he has only one 
alternative which is to launch some kind of attack mahe said 
added william schneider of the american enterprise institute 
one of the things he has to do is depict a vote for bush as a 
risk i think there is a lot of potential for bushs negatives to 
go up if he addresses some of the risky factors associated with 
voting for bush 
those factors according to schneider include the vice 
presidents role in the irancontra scandal the reagan 
administrations antidrug efforts and the selection of indiana 
sen dan quayle as his running mate 
an aggressive dukakis would please the many democrats who blame 
bushs surge on the failure of dukakis to respond forcefully to 
republican attacks 
its still a very winnable race for dukakis said new jersey 
sen bill bradley said wednesday but he needs to be more intense 
and amplify his message 
siegel and others also said dukakis must convince voters he is a 
man of passion and vision 
he is a much warmer decent and compassionate person than has 
appeared so far said siegel michael dukakis is not an iceman 
i think that comes through when he is in these kind of 
surroundings 
dach dismissed questions about whether the network addresses 
will be viewed as a sign of desperation 
i think the public wants to hear more from the candidates 
he said we want to be sure that they get to see very clearly 
where michael dukakis will take this country 
larry sabato a university of virginia political scientist who 
specializes in campaign media was unimpressed with the dukakis 
strategy 
i dont think it will work sabato said i dont think you 
can turn around a significant lead by your opponent this way 
schneider however said nationally televised addresses would 
give dukakis an opportuntiy to make up for what was widely viewed 
as a lackluster performance in his final debate with bush 
of course some will view it as a sign of desperation 
schneider said it is better for him to shrug and give up hes 
not too far behind for it to work

a state senate candidate running on a 
platform of fiscal restraint is practicing what he preaches using 
brochures left over from an unsuccesful campaign 18 years ago and 
not accepting any contributions 
why should i ask my friends to pay for my folly said donald 
a jepsen of windsor who is challenging democratic incumbent frank 
d barrows of hartford in the 2nd senate district im depending 
entirely on the fourth estate to get the word out 
jepson acknowledges that he has virtually no chance of winning 
in the heavily democratic district 
jepsens campaign literature is left over from his unsuccessful 
race for state representative in 1970 and features his wife jane 
and the couples four children 
you see the youngest girl there he said recently pointing 
to his daughter laura then 4 years old shes a graduate 
student now 
the old brochures urge voters to restore fiscal responsibility 
of our state government through new republican leadership and 
address such issues as housing pollution crime and drug abuse 
the really weird thing is none of the issues have changed 
barrows said

major fraud in government purchasing could 
earn violators 10year prison sentences and 10 million fines under 
legislation on its way to president reagans desk for his signature 
procurement fraud costs our country hundreds of millions of 
dollars a year rep william hughes dnj said thursday as the 
house gave final approval to the measure on a voice vote 
the bill designed to crack down on cheating among defense 
contractors would establish a new crime of major procurement 
fraud applying to losses involving 1 million or more 
maximum sentences of 10 years in prison could be imposed under 
the bill courts also could fine especially flagrant violators up 
to 10 million 
the house already had passed such a measure and in its action 
merely agreed to amendments attached by the senate approval came 
without any controversy on the floor 
a statute of limitations of seven years would be established 
under the bill in contrast to the normal one of five years 
whistleblower protections would be afforded to those drawing 
attention to major fraud 
among other things the senate amendments would authorize 8 
million over four years for hiring additional prosecutors to handle 
fraud cases but a house feature authorizing 250000 rewards for 
whistleblowing was deleted by the senate

firearms capable of passing through detection 
devices without setting off alarms would be outlawed under 
legislation approved by the house and on its way to the senate 
plastic gun technology presents enormous problems for our law 
enforcement community said rep william hughes dnj as the 
bill won approval on a voice vote thursday 
the measure which would outlaw manufacture import sale or 
possession of the largely plastic guns now goes to the senate 
a similar bill is part of the major drug bill now in a 
housesenate conference committee but press secretary mark brown 
said hughes wanted to keep a separate version moving simply to 
keep both irons in the fire 
violators would be subject to 250000 in fines for individuals 
and 1 million for organizations the bill also calls for prison 
terms of up to 5 years for violators 
the bill would not affect existing firearms because they do not 
fall below the minimum levels of detection devices the legislation 
would provide exemptions for the military and intelligence agencies

commercials depicting democrat michael dukakis 
as soft on crime are moving more voters this year than anything 
else a pollster said as a handful of new antidukakis crime ads 
hit california airwaves 
the committee for the presidency an independent group backing 
republican george bush said thursday that its three ads would 
start today on tv stations in los angeles san diego and 
bakersfield and may be used later in other states 
the spots feature firstperson accounts of crimes involving 
willie horton a convicted murderer who failed to return to prison 
from a weekend furlough under a program supported by dukakis the 
governor of massachusetts 
the independent ads hit on the same themes as bush campaign 
spots that according to pollster lou harris have had an enormous 
impact on the election 
really more than the debates more than anything else they 
have determined the set of the election until now he said 
thursday of bush commercials hammering the furlough program and 
dukakis opposition to capital punishment 
bushs 9point lead in the latest harris poll was built mainly 
through his crime spots harris said before an appearance in 
rochester ny 
he said 63 percent of voters see dukakis as soft on crime as 
opposed to 52 percent before the bush attacks aired and 49 percent 
term the governor out of the political mainstream compared with 34 
percent who did so before the advertising blitz 
dukakis did not starting any new national or regional 
advertising thursday according to spokeswoman lorraine voles but 
he scheduled an appearance today on abcs good morning america 
and dayton duncan his press secretary said the campaign had 
purchased five minutes of time on the same network to air a speech 
at 955 pm saturday 
the new antidukakis spots feature donna cuomo whose brother 
was murdered by horton and cliff barnes whom horton stabbed 
several months after his release on a weekend pass horton also 
raped barnes fiancee 
cuomo and barnes are shown in tight closeups their faces and 
voices grim as they recount their experiences and criticize 
dukakis record 
first dukakis let killers out of prison he also vetoed the 
death penalty says cuomo of north andover mass in one spot 
willie horton stabbed my teenage brother 19 times joey died 
horton was sentenced to life without parole but dukakis gave him a 
furlough he never returned horton went on to rape and torture 
others 
barnes of maryland says horton was serving a life term without 
parole when governor dukakis gave him a few days off horton 
broke into our home for 12 hours i was beaten slashed and 
terrorized my wife angie was brutally raped when his liberal 
experiment failed dukakis simply looked away we are worried 
people dont know enough about mike dukakis 
the committee for the presidency said it purchased 125000 of 
airtime for a weeklong run of the two spots and a 60second 
combination of the two they may run in other california markets 
and western states if they are needed said spokesman fred karger 
rep bill thomas rcalif a cochairman of the group 
acknowledged under questioning that the furlough program was 
started by a republican governor who preceded dukakis but he said 
the point is that dukakis at first vetoed a legislative attempt to 
modify the program 
its far more important to us how it was ended thomas said 
the governor who started it isnt running for president

trailing badly in the national polls they went on bread and 
water on bentsens campaign jet this week 
actually it was bread and perrier with a twist of lime and no 
hardship at all reporters the secret service staff and the 
candidate were enjoying some of ba bentsens sixgrain bread 
all aboard the campaign jet agreed it was better than the 
regular airplane food and some were still eating it two days later 
about 80 loaves were baked to mrs bentsens family recipe and 
distributed to the texas senators entourage and his capitol hill 
office jokes were made about mrs bentsen still brushing off the 
flour as she raced to the plane but a washington caterer handled 
the job 
each loaf which cost the campaign about 180 came with a copy 
of the recipe and a poem 
a loaf of bread the bentsens said is what we chiefly need 
butter or margarine besides are very good indeed 
enjoy 
signed ba bentsen with apologies to lewis carroll and the 
walrus 
mrs bentsen said the recipe was one she got from a cook who 
worked for the senators father on their ranch near mcallen in 
south texas she bakes it often though not much during the 
campaign season and the senator likes it better than cake 
the ingredients of the coursetextured yeast bread include maple 
syrup or honey blackstrap molasses wheat germ raw sunflower 
kernels bran rye flour and regular and whole wheat flour mrs 
bentsen said the caterer did an admirable job but her own was 
better probably because of the quantities involved

next to mrs bentsens bread the most popular food item on the 
bentsen campaign at least in conversation is of course quail

his debate with sen dan quayle the republican vice presidential 
nominee 
bentsen frequently jokes about going quail hunting and says the 
democrats will come from behind this year and make em eat 
quail instead of eating crow 
reporters found quail at a houston restaurant and couldnt 
resist it was grilled and had a wonderful sauce on it said a 
television producer 
in arkansas a local caterer sent to the campaign jet a tray of 
smoked baby quail and a little doggerel on the side 
there once was a bird named quayle 
who went on the gop trail 
we tried to rhyme 
but ran out of time

basketball allstar david robinson will have 
to wait one more year to begin his professional sports career the 
secretary of the navy said in requiring the 7foot1 center to 
fulfill his obligation to the military 
robinson already holds an eightyear 26 million contract with 
the san antonio spurs and had hoped to begin his pro career this 
year instead of waiting until next his twoyear commitment to the 
navy doesnt expire until may 17 1989 
robinson an ensign said he accepted the ruling thursday by 
navy secretary william l ball iii and would serve the remainder of 
his activeduty navy hitch with pride 
an allamerican while at the us naval academy robinson played 
with americas olympic basketball team this summer after the 
olympics ended he petitioned ball to be released from active duty 
before completing his required twoyear service commitment 
in return robinson suggested the navy increase his obligation 
to the naval reserve 
ball however decided he was not going to tamper with the 
current navy policies regarding activeduty servicemen and 
professional sports endeavors by providing robinson with a special 
exception said one source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the navy declined to discuss balls decision beyond 
acknowledging the secretary had spoken by telephone with robinson 
on thursday morning 
robinson currently assigned to the navys trident submarine 
base at kings bay ga as a civil engineering officer was not 
available for direct comment 
but his agent a lee fentress released a statement in which 
robinson said he was proud to have been able to serve in the navy 
over the past 17 months 
naval academy graduates are normally required to serve on active 
duty for a minimum of five years robinsons commitment was cut in 
1987 however by thennavy secretary john lehman in part because 
the basketball star had grown so tall 
his height prevented him from serving in socalled unrestricted 
line specialities such as aviation submarines or surface warfare 
after graduation 
robinson could not have entered the naval academy at his present 
size but was 6foot7 when he was accepted for admission his 
senior year in high school 
lehman in deciding robinsons future with the navy ruled he 
should serve two years on active duty four years in the active 
reserve and two years in the inactive reserve

dan quayle headed south after 
scorning michael dukakis complaints that republicans are 
distorting the democrats record on crime issues 
now we have the man from massachusetts claiming his stand on 
crime is being distorted said quayle this is coming from a 
man who blamed george bush for last years drop in the stock 
market 
quayles comments came thursday as his bus caravan wound through 
ohio where he focused on economic themes in a pitch to bluecollar 
voters 
the campaign turns to the south today stumping in tennessee and 
georgia after spending all week in quayles native midwest 
in ohio a hotly competitive state quayle insisted that 
economic recovery has left most of the nation better off 
it means for the first time ever we can make and keep the 
promise of a job for every american who wants a job said quayle 
but along the way he couldnt resist taking jabs at democratic 
presidential nominee dukakis who has complained that republicans 
are guilty of distorting his record on criminals 
lets try to give a few facts on the crime issue quayle 
told a crowd at a zanesville ohio shopping mall 
massachusetts quayle said has the most liberal prison 
furlough program in the country 
mr dukakis defended his furlough program throughout his 
governorship quayle said he refused to change it until forced 
to do so by public pressure in this election year 
quayle insisted the attack was simply a response to issues the 
democrats dont like to discuss 
if i had their liberal ideas i guess i wouldnt want to talk 
about it either he said since they dont want to talk it 
well talk about it 
but for the most part quayles campaign centered on folksy 
parades kidding with schoolchildren and pepping up volunteers 
the message of the day was aimed at reagan democrats featuring 
claims that the last few years have resulted in economic growth and 
opportunity 
this economy is generating millions of jobs in highpaying 
occupations he said those are good jobs at good wages it 
adds up to a job for all who want to work 
the jobs and prosperity theme is standard gop fare but quayle 
expanded it slightly saying its time to make sure minorities are 
included 
the next administration must move for the full integration of 
blacks and hispanics into the economy he said the last seven 
years have built a foundation for doing exactly that 
the final weeks of the campaign have featured an intense 
concentration on a series of states such as ohio where both sides 
say the race is competitive 
president reagan swung through ohio the day before quayle while 
dukakis was to visit later 
quayle was questioned thursday about earlier comments by sen 
edward kennedy dmass that the indiana senator had been unfairly 
portrayed in the media 
i appreciate his comments quayle said i think its 
appropriate weve worked together on several issues

aids victim bill travis celebrates his 25th 
birthday today with dionne warwick several dozen of their close 
friends and top officials of the federal health bureaucracy 
the highly public spectacle intended as a birthday salute to 
all people with aids comes a year after travis decided to allow 
government officials to cast him as a sort of unofficial poster boy 
for aids 
my job now is to be public he said in an interview on his 
24th birthday i dont particularly enjoy being photographed but 
its something ive learned to tolerate if i become the aids 
poster boy thats ok 
his story appeared in newspapers from coast to coast including 
his account of the family members who admonished why dont you 
just stay quiet why are you dragging us through this we have to 
live with this youre going to die anyway 
soon he was getting calls from television shows to appear and 
talk about his struggle with the deadly disease and subsequently 
has maintained an often exhausting schedule of speaking 
engagements most often to student groups 
does he have any regrets a year later 
i was in kansas city last monday and after speaking to a group 
of people one of them asked me if i feel people with aids are 
being exploited when they are put into the media or in public 
speaking engagements he says 
my answer was simply that i made the choice to do this i 
dont feel if the people i am speaking to are listening and hearing 
what i have to say taking it to heart for the knowledge and value 
of it that is not exploitation that is a learning process 
ive enjoyed doing what i can and it gives me personal 
satisfaction to know that in the ways i could ive made what 
difference i could and even more important ive encouraged others 
to make even larger differences 
still travis is conscious that he is on stage most of the 
time now and that can get trying 
my individual birthday has been very personal to me he said 
in a telephone interview wednesday his actual birthday it means 
so much i have to keep that personal today was my day for me 
the thing about the party on friday is i want to share that i 
dont mind sharing that on friday thats the whole idea a 
celebration for all people with aids their birthdays and that 
there is hope they can have more and maybe some things will happen 
faster then we ever thought 
today was very nice he said of his actual birthday i did 
get up and have a glass of champagne with breakfast because i was 
very happy because i was just thinking back to how little hope i 
was originally given for surviving even to that first birthday 
i was very happy this was three now that i wasnt supposed to 
make i wasnt supposed to make any three of these gigs and now im 
making all three 
they gave me two weeks to live at one point 
that was more than three years ago 
the birthday party for travis and several others suffering from 
aids is sponsored jointly by the warwick foundation created by the 
famous singer to fight aids showtime networks and the public 
health service 
showtime plans to screen a 15minute aids awareness tape that is 
being distributed by the public health service to state and local 
education authorities for use in junior and senior high schools 
other entertainers taking part in the celebration are julie 
harris and brock peters now appearing in the kennedy center 
production of driving miss daisy and three members of the san 
francisco ballet also now appearing at the kennedy center 
among the government officials taking part are surgeon general 
c everett koop and dr robert e windom the assistant health and 
human services secretary for health and head of the public health 
service

angered by the communist 
leaderships refusal to overhaul the party power structure 
thousands of serbs rally in a restive province and demand the 
ouster of provincial leaders 
chanting thieves and you betrayed the people a jeering 
crowd of 5000 people turned their backs thursday on two members of 
the ruling national politburo who came to the province of kosovo to 
respond to serbian grievances 
the flagwaving crowd gathered in a suburb of kosovos capital 
pristina but protesters mostly ignored the remarks by politburo 
members marko orlandic and kacusa jasari who also heads kosovos 
communist party 
after trying to placate the crowd for an hour the two senior 
party officials eventually were hustled away under police escort 
when some serbs tried to rush toward them 
later thursday a nearby rally of more than 20000 serbs 
demanded the ouster within five days of the entire party leadership 
in kosovo an ancient serbian heartland bordering albania and 
dominated by ethnic albanians 
kosovo is one of two autonomous provinces over which serbia the 
largest of six national republics has some control serb 
nationalists are angry at what they see as a blow to their drive 
for increased control by serbia over kosovo where serbs claim 
discrimination by ethnic albanians 
the setback came wednesday when dusan ckrebic a serbian 
communist closely identified with serbian party leader slobodan 
milosevic failed to win a secret confidence vote at the end of a 
threeday session of the partys policymaking central committee 
ckrebic has offered to resign but milosevic says he needs serbian 
approval to do so 
the vote was seen as a criticism of milosevic he has been a 
force behind months of serbian nationalist protests that have 
combined with economic unrest and culminated in calls for new 
national and regional leadership 
on thursday the kosovo serbs chanted we will not give up 
ckrebic we will not give up dusan and members of the 
central committee you have shown your true faces 
kosovos 200000 serbs and montenegrins both slavic peoples 
had hoped the central committee session would oust some of the 
ethnic albanian communist leadership of kosovo but no action was 
taken and no measures announced to stop the purported harassment

a pet java monkey was none the worse 
for wear after eluding police and animal control officers on a 
merry chase that included a failed attempt to get him drunk 
the 5yearold monkey jesse was at large for most of the day 
wednesday when they failed to snare him with a longhandled net he 
ate two peanutbutter sandwiches laced with tranquilizers and 
remained energetic 
a bowl of liquor was set out in the hopes the monkey would drink 
it and nod off he poured it over animal control officer julie 
britton 
finally a dart from a tranquilizer gun knocked him out so his 
owner sheila walline could retrieve him from his rooftop perch 
jesses new eightfoot long cage which reaches to the ceiling 
was being built when he escaped tuesday night ms walline said he 
climbed on a clothes dryer to reach the knob of an inside door 
he opened that and he opened the screen door and out he 
went she said 
officials made several attempts to catch him in the next two 
days as he was spotted in trees and on rooftops throughout the 
neighborhood 
the grayishbrown monkey about 18 inches tall seemed annoyed 
by the capture attempts frequently bouncing up and down and baring 
his teeth before scampering out of reach

nicaraguan officials worried about the readiness of government

the nations airlines are being told to 
examine the takeoff warning horns on two of the industrys most 
widely used jetliners after faulty alarms were found in 35 of the 
aircraft 
the inspections on nearly 1800 boeing 727s and 737s which were 
ordered thursday by the federal aviation administration comes as 
federal accident investigators continue to try to determine whether 
an alarm may have failed on a delta air lines boeing 727 that 
crashed last august at the dallasfort worth airport 
the alarm is designed to sound if a pilot has forgotten to 
prepare an aircraft properly for takeoff such as leaving wing 
flaps which help give a plane lift in the wrong position 
the national transportation safety board has said there is 
evidence though not conclusively determined that the flaps may 
not have been in the proper position on the delta jet yet a 
cockpit voice recorder tape shows the alarm did not sound the ntsb 
investigation into the crash which killed 14 people is not yet 
completed 
as a result of questions surrounding the delta accident the faa 
last month ordered a onetime purely precautionary check of the 
takeoff alarms on nearly 1200 boeing 727s the agency announced 
thursday that in 35 cases the alarms either did not work or worked 
improperly 
this condition if not corrected could result in an attempted 
takeoff with the airplane in the improper configuration and with 
the takeoff warning system inoperative the faa told the airlines 
in its special airworthiness directive 
the faa said 29 of the jets with defective warning systems 
belonged to three airlines continental airlines with 17 eastern 
airlines eight and delta air lines four united airlines and 
federal express each had two planes with faulty alarms and orion 
air and amerijet international each had one the faa said 
the airlines were ordered to conduct repetitive testing of 
all the alarm systems including the repair and replacement of 
inoperative components if necessary on the 727s as well as boeing 
737s which the faa said had a similar system subject to similar 
failures 
faa spokesman john leyden said the inspections which are likely 
to take about three hours must be made within 200 flying hours and 
then repeated every 200 hours he said they are not expected to 
disrupt the airlines normal operating schedules since they likely 
will be conducted during routine maintenance 
a takeoff warning alarm although a different design from those 
on the boeing aircraft failed to sound last year on a mcdonnell 
douglas md80 jetliner after the flight crew forgot to set the 
planes flaps keeping it from gaining proper lift the northwest 
airlines jet crashed seconds after taking off from detroit 
metropolitan airport killing 156 people 
no special tests have been conducted on the md80 alarm system 
although mcdonnell douglas and the faa has advised operators that 
flight crews should manually check the warning alarm before each 
takeoff 
in seattle craig martin a spokesman for the boeing co 
reserved comment on the faa order saying he had not seen it 
according to industry figures 1148 boeing 727s and 634 boeing 
737s were being flown by major us airlines at the beginning of 
this year boeing had orders for delivering another 73 boeing 737s 
this year but it could not be determined how many of those 
actually are in airlines hands the boeing 727 is no longer 
produced 
the warning system sounds whenever a set of control or flight 
devices is not placed in proper position in the two boeing jets 
the alarm is a loud horn while in some other model aircraft such 
as the mcdonnell douglas md80 a computerized voice provides the 
warning 
the alarm is designed to protect against improper configuration 
of such items as the power throttle flaps which help a plane gain 
lift during takeoff speed brakes which are used to slow the plane 
when landing but must be disengaged on takeoff and leading edge 
slats which are essential for a plane to gain lift 
according to the air transport association figures the airlines 
with at least 100 boeing 727s in operation are american airlines 
united airlines delta eastern airlines and continental airlines 
continental delta united piedmont airlines usair and southwest 
airlines are among the major users of boeing 737s

along with its president and 18 employees with stealing from 
student financialaid programs 
the 65count 87page indictment charging racketeering 
falsifying documents and theft or misapplication of funds followed 
a threeyear probe of wilfred academies of hair and beauty culture 
operations in tampa st petersburg and orlando a federal 
prosecutor said 
wilfred is a publiclyheld corporation based in new york its 
students receive about 75 million a year in federal educational 
entitlement funds placing the school among the top five of its 
kind in the country authorities said 
philip e jakeway jr of east chester ny wilfreds 
65yearold president and chief executive officer and 18 officers 
and employees are accused of scheming to defraud the us 
department of education 
jakeway and the corporation are charged with 28 counts of making 
false statements 27 counts of stealing embezzling or misapplying 
funds either provided or insured by the department of education 
eight counts of wire fraud and a single count of operating a 
racketeering enterprise 
a young person studying to be a cosmetologist or beautician can 
receive 2500 aid a year toward tuition and expenses at a wilfred 
school 
investigators said the money frequently didnt reach the 
applicant and went instead into a large pool operated by wilfred 
for the most part the students were in their late teens and 
unfamiliar with loan or grant applications said james b thomas 
jr of the department of educations inspector generals office 
they were told to sign blank applications to which false 
information was added he said or they were induced to give false 
information to ensure government aid 
in many cases they were aided by school officials or they relied 
on them to help complete the paperwork he said 
most of the time the money was not sent directly to the 
students but to wilfred said thomas at a joint news conference in 
tampa with the fbi and us attorney robert genzman of the middle 
district of florida 
students frequently didnt get the money wound up in debt and 
eventually dropped out he said 
authorities said investigators conducted 300 interviews and 
sifted through 6000 documents going back until 1979 on the 
racketeering count and 1981 on the other charges 
investigations are being conducted elsewhere authorities said 
without disclosing what states and thomas said eight employees 
previously pleaded in a similar case in boston 
genzman said officials dont know how many students were 
involved he said investigators tried to figure how much money was 
involved but it was difficult to do 
it could be in the hundreds of thousands or millions of 
dollars he said 
arrest warrants were issued for those indicted and arrangements 
were made to allow them to surrender

state and federal investigators are 
continuing their probe of a dying mans claim that he helped with 
the church bombing that killed four black girls in 1963 
authorities said thursday 
its still kind of early to know whether he is credible or 
not said rusty loftin an assistant state attorney general who 
talked to gary a tucker in a veterans hospital at tuscaloosa 
where tucker is a cancer patient 
tucker mentioned some names loftin said adding that 
authorities need to talk to other people to find something to 
corroborate what hes telling us 
in a story published friday the birmingham postherald quoted 
unidentified department of justice sources as saying that tucker 
named a man serving a prison term in alabama on theft and drug 
charges as an accomplice in the bombing 
the inmate who is reported to be a boyhood friend of tuckers 
denied tuckers claims and would not comment on whether he had been 
interviewed by the fbi 
the inmate who according to prison records has been in and out 
of prisons since the early 1970s also denied knowing robert 
chambliss the ku klux klansman convicted in 1977 in the killing of 
one of the four girls 
relatives and friends of the 54yearold tucker have said he 
suffers from hallucinations and probably is seeking attention 
in washington ray mcelhaney of the fbi said thursday that the 
agency which has interviewed tucker has an investigative 
interest and we are coordinating with the us attorneys office 
and local authorities in birmingham 
mcelhaney said any other comment from the fbi would be 
inappropriate 
loftin would not elaborate on tuckers mentioning the names of 
others he said were involved with him in the sept 15 1963 
bombing of the 16th street baptist church 
i think its safe to say weve always suspected other people 
were involved loftin said if what hes saying is true that 
could very well be 
chambliss 73 at the time of the bombing died in prison in 1985 
while serving a life sentence on the murder charge 
loftin asked whether tucker mentioned chambliss said that 
tucker doesnt remember a lot but that chambliss could be a 
part of the story we dont know at this point how it all ties in 
together loftin said 
jefferson county district attorney david barber has refused to 
comment saying that tuckers statements are being sorted out 
the bombing killed carole robertson cynthia wesley and addie 
mae collins all 14 and denise mcnair 11 they were in a womens 
lounge when the bomb blast tore through the wall from concrete 
steps outside the church 
former attorney general bill baxley who prosecuted chambliss 
said he had never heard of tucker or the inmate mentioned by tucker 
since tucker contacted authorities last week and told them he 
took part in the bombing he has been placed in a guarded room at 
the tuscaloosa hospital 
tucker is a former truck driver who in 1963 lived in sumiton 
about 25 northwest of birmingham tucker who was 29 at the time of 
the bombing has refused to talk with reporters

the war ended for lt col thomas hart 
iii when his gunship was ravaged by enemy fire and crashed into the 
laotian forest just before christmas in 1972 
his wifes fight ended in federal court thursday when a judge 
awarded her family 632000 for the severe emotional distress they 
suffered after the us air force misidentified bone fragments as 
harts remains in 1985 
in a decision that attorneys said could set a precedent for 
other cases involving missing soldiers senior us district judge 
winston arnow ruled the air force was responsible for the distress 
to harts wife anne her daughter gillian hart and harts mother 
vera lee hart 
for anne hart the money is small compensation however 
money has never been the issue said mrs hart reached at 
home following the decision there is no amount of money that can 
undo the damage that has been done to my family but we might keep 
the government from doing this again to another family 
mrs harts battle against the military began in 1985 when about 
50000 bone fragments and personal objects taken from a laotian 
crash site were analyzed by the air force and some were identified 
as harts remains 
but mrs hart had refused to accept the identification which 
was based on small bone fragments and battled the air force to win 
an independent evaluation the probe found the fragments were 
insufficient to prove the identities of most of the crash victims 
hart was one of 16 people aboard an ac130 gunship shot down 
over laos two crewmen survived and were rescued but hart was 
listed as missing in action six years later the government changed 
his status to presumed dead 
she is pleased this case is going to serve as a precedent for 
the families of other southeast asia war veterans said her 
attorney fran frick it will afford them some protection against 
the same thing happening to them 
arnow had ruled in january that mrs hart suffered from severe 
emotional distress but he delayed the issue of damages until this 
months trial which lasted two weeks 
this has never been a winorlose situation for her ms 
frick said what the government has done has ruined her life no 
amount of money is going to give her back what shes lost 
ms frick said the government may have hurried the 
identifications to reinforce the joint effort between laos and the 
united states the first cooperation between the two countries 
after the war 
lt col keith schneider a pentagon spokesman said in 
washington that the defense department did not have any immediate 
comment on the ruling

satanic murders and other rituals 
nbc hired me to bring the viewer into the belly of this 
beast he said there is an aspect of the grotesque in the 
ritual crimes that are being committed out there 
if you sanitize it to make it more palatable to the network 
censors then you do violence to the truth in our opinion

opening of the touring revival of the show 
he said that since first appearing in the show he had a chance 
to visit a nightclub in hamburg west germany that was much more 
sinister than the fictional kit kat klub of 1930s berlin of 
cabaret 
grey won a tony as the master of ceremonies in the original 
stage version of cabaret that opened in new york in 1966 then 
won an academy award as best supporting actor in 1972 for the same

faced with a revolt by conservatives 
congressional leaders attached antiobscenity provisions to a 
compromise drug bill so the measure can pass and the 100th congress 
can go home 
a weary house speaker jim wright predicted thursday night that 
both houses would approve the leaders final agreement on the 
drug bill today but cautioned that the obscenity language could 
not be nailed down until lawmakers reviewed it the bill is the 
major legislation keeping congress in session 
after marathon meetings by rankandfile negotiators wright 
along with the majority and minority leaders of both houses 
gathered to tackle the unresolved issues thursday night 
the thorniest among them proved to be senatepassed language to 
give the federal government broad new powers to combat obscenity 
earlier in the day rankandfile lawmakers stripped the 
language from the drug bill after liberals insisted the 
governments powers would be too broad 
we were threatened with a revolt by conservatives said 
wright who admitted he began envisioning an embarrassing floor 
fight that would destroy his effort to unite liberals and 
conservatives democrats and republicans behind the bill that 
could help all incumbents 
a coalition of conservative groups began an intense lastditch 
telephone campaign to win inclusion of the antiobscenity 
provisions said diane quartermain legislative affairs director of 
the liberty federation formerly the moral majority 
the bill which would authorize some 25 billion in new 
antidrug money is an ambitious attempt to deal with all aspects 
of the drug problem including law enforcement treatment 
rehabilitation education and help for authorities in 
drugproducing countries 
new initiatives would include up to 10000 in civil fines for 
those caught with personal use amounts of drugs a federal death 
penalty for killers in drugrelated crimes and denial of some 
federal benefits to convicted drug offenders including users 
a number of lawmakers cautioned the drug bill would be 
meaningless without new financing and the house appropriations 
committee took quick action thursday 
the panel approved 500 million in new spending for the drug 
bill an amount that would pay for barely a third of the estimated 
14 billion firstyear costs of the legislation the final cost is 
expected to be about 25 billion if the multiyear measure is 
fully financed 
the 500 million includes 242 million for treatment 
prevention and education 179 million for new agents and equipment 
for federal law enforcement agencies 42 million for the federal 
courts 25 million for the coast guard and the rest for programs 
of the departments of state and agriculture and the food and drug 
administration 
a combined bill to combat adult obscenity and child pornography 
had passed the senate 970 previously and was added to the drug 
bill when the house refused to take action the child pornography 
language was approved by the drug bill negotiators 
the obscenity language passed by the senate would allow the 
federal government to seize property used to commit or promote an 
obscenity offense and authorize the government to seek civil fines 
against those producing transporting or receiving obscene 
materials 
but wright said the leadership agreed to target only major 
dealers or producers of obscene materials who were knowingly 
engaged for a long period of time he said the language was not 
aimed at the bookstore owner who may have a single volume judged to 
be obscene 
he called the language constitutionally respectable and 
acceptable 
lawmakers opted to accept portions of house and senate language 
on a program to deny federal benefits to convicted drug offenders 
including those convicted of possession 
benefits such as federal public housing grants contracts 
loans mortgage guarantees and some forms of veterans aid could 
be lost to drug offenders judges would have discretion however 
on whether to impose the penalty after conviction 
the president would submit a report on the program to congress 
next may allowing lawmakers to reconsider the proposal no one 
could be denied benefits before next september social security 
medicare welfare benefits and some other veterans aid programs 
would be exempted even after september 
negotiators agreed that if someone is killed during a federal 
drug felony the federal death penalty could apply if the killer 
was engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise was trafficking in 
major amounts of cocaine heroin or other drugs intentionally gave 
an order that resulted in a killing or killed a police officer 
in other key decisions negotiators 
agreed to create a drug czar in the presidents cabinet to 
coordinate national drug policy the official would develop plans 
for every phase of the drug war share with relevant cabinet heads 
the authority to transfer personnel and have the right to object 
when he believes drug funding is inadequate or misdirected 
dropped a house provision that would have permitted 
introduction in federal court of evidence seized illegally but in 
good faith even in warrantless searches 
accepted senate language on child pornography including a 
20yeartolife prison term for anyone convicted of facilitating 
use of a child for producing sexually explicit materials 
gave the justice department nine months to develop a system for 
gun dealers to check whether purchasers are convicted felons 
agreed that records of those punished by civil fines would be 
expunged automatically after a period of time 
resolved that states initially would have to contribute 25 
percent of the cost of federal grants for antidrug crime programs 
after the first year of the fouryear program the state portion 
would go to 50 percent 
agreed to restore to us attorneys the ability to prosecute 
corrupt public officials under the theory that they deprived 
americans of honest government services a supreme court ruling in 
june 1987 had prevented such prosecutions

employees lowincome pregnant women gang members students and

the families of 10 people killed when a 
military jet ripped through a hotel lobby lashed out at the air 
force on the anniversary of the crash accusing officials of what 
one called the utmost insensitivity 
sobs filled the charred shell of the ramada innairport on 
thursday as parents poked through the debris where their children 
died in a fireball on oct 20 1987 a year later the sevenstory 
hotel remains blackened damaged and smelling of smoke 
thats where my daughter died we think those were her 
shoes said robert t goldberg pointing to a desktop in what was 
once the office of his daughter beth who handled reservations for 
the hotel 
air force master sgt larry martin and his wife cheryl combed 
the rubble for the baby ring their daughter dawn shelly always 
wore before her death 
it should be here it should be here martin said as tears 
filled his eyes 
family members said they are bitter about their treatment by the 
us air force which doesnt have to pay damages under indiana law 
for the deaths of adult victims who left no dependents 
when the us air force kills innocent people survivors 
should receive justice goldberg said 
he and other parents contend the indiana law prevents people 
here from receiving justice equal to those in other states 
because the air force is hiding behind indianas wrongful 
death law we are being treated with the utmost insensitivity 
martin said 
he added that the air force has shown little compassion for 
our family and it has chosen to devalue that beautiful gift of 
human life by treating the survivors families as if we are the 
guilty party in this wrongful act 
the families said they want the law to be changed and they want 
a jury to decide whether the crash was caused by negligence and 
whether damages should be awarded 
an air force panel already has cleared the pilot maj bruce 
teagarden of any wrongdoing in the crash 
teagarden was en route from pittsburgh to nellis air force base 
in nevada when his jets engine shut down he was trying to land at 
indianapolis international airport when he was forced to eject and 
the jet hit the hotel he was unhurt 
maintenance records showed previous mechanical problems with the 
jet and an air force investigation indicated that teagarden and 
air traffic controllers violated some regulations during the 
emergency 
several families have filed suit against the government 
goldberg said the air force has offered his family 50000 as 
compensation for his daughters death 
the air force has been trying to reach settlements quickly 
compassionately and responsibly said lt col thomas a mahr 
public affairs officer for air force headquarters in washington 
dc we believe we are offering equitable settlements within the 
bounds of the laws that apply 
hotel owner sam saini of dayton ohio called air force 
officials inhuman people and said he plans to file a 13 
million lawsuit against the air force this week in us district 
court here 
saini who wants to reopen the hotel said the air force offered 
him a 5 million settlement last month sainis insurance company 
paid him 42 million but that covers only half his losses 
on thursday the victims relatives and friends also gathered at 
st christopher catholic church for a memorial service sponsored by 
the countys victim assistance fund

small parties especially those 
representing arabs and religious jews could determine whether the 
rightwing likud bloc or the leftist labor party is the big winner 
in israels nov 1 elections 
the race is expected to be close with the winner being the 
major party that woos the most small parties into a coalition after 
the balloting is over 
there are 25 small parties and pollsters predict they will 
garner up to 40 percent of the votes cast and an unprecedented 
number of seats in the 120member knesset or parliament 
the most sought after are the religious parties 
jews who vote primarily on the basis of religious questions make 
up 10 percent of the 29 million eligible voters five religious 
parties won 13 seats in 1984 and seven parties are contending this 
time 
religious groups have drifted to the right in recent years and 
most of their leaders express a preference for likud but they 
leave open the possibility of joining labor 
rabbi moshe zeev feldman head of the agudat yisrael party of 
ultraorthodox said recently at his home in the religious 
community of bnei brak that moral issues such as drug use and dress 
take precedence over peace and security which are the key issues 
between the blocs 
there can be no security without the help of god without 
gods hand guiding the triggers of our soldiers there never was 
any success and can be no success 
what we are very troubled about is the deteriorating moral 
climate said feldman whose party controls two parliament seats 
he said likuds positions were closer to his partys but that 
doesnt mean labor cant change 
some say support for religious legislation and yesheva seminary 
schools may be determining factors in persuading such parties to 
join a coalition 
the arab vote is more problematic because araboriented parties 
like the communists have publicly identified with the palestine 
liberation organization they have thus been regarded as unfit 
coalition partners by both major blocs 
palestinians with israeli citizenship make up about 12 percent 
of the eligible voters they could control 14 seats or more 
depending on the turnout 
two araboriented parties currently hold six seats other arab 
voters cast ballots for israeli parties in the last election 
giving labor about two seats worth of votes 
this time labor is expected to lose ground because of the tough 
measures adopted by defense minister yitzhak rabin of labor in 
putting down the uprising at least 301 palestinians and six 
israelis have died since the uprising began dec 8 
attallah mansour of the al sinara arabic newspaper in nazareth 
predicted that 70 percent of the arab vote would go to parties on 
the extreme left 
labor will be punished for rabins actions mansour said 
to see israeli soldiers shoot arab civilians in the occupied 
territories every day on television is an issue for us 
to get into the knesset a party needs to win 1 percent of the 
vote or about 24000 ballots only 12 or 13 small parties are 
expected to clear this hurdle 
some parties have little chance these include the quiet 
force which advocates a less noisy and aggressive society 
other small parties are offshoots of the major parties and 
almost certainly will join them in trying to form a ruling 
coalition of 61 parliament seats 
foreign minister shimon peres labor for example can count on 
the support of the liberal civil rights movement the socialist 
mapam party and the centrist shinui party 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud will get backing from the 
prosettlement tehiya party the tzomet faction of exchief of 
staff raful eytan and the moledet party which advocates the 
voluntary transfer abroad of palestinians

the media has run out of heartrending 
human interest stories and is rapidly losing interest in aids while 
researchers still struggle to cure the deadly disease experts say 
aids will be a major topic again when journalists can announce 
a cure or a vaccine roger staub of the swiss aids campaign said 
thursday at the conclusion of a fourday conference on the disease 
more than 600 researchers health workers psychologists 
sociologists and other scientists from 72 nations gathered at this 
pacific resort for the first international symposium on education 
and communication about aids 
next years aids symposium will take place in the west african 
nation of cameroon 
among the topics debated was the medias treatment of the 
disease jim bunn a television reporter from san francisco who 
works for the world health organization said the decline in media 
interest is all part of the evolution of the disease 
the stories about heartache have been told time and time 
again he said discussing what some participants called aids 
fatigue 
jonathan mann director of whos global program against aids 
said a conference on aids in stockholm earlier this year was the 
high point of media interest but it ebbed quickly 
the media is much less interested in aids than it was a year 
ago mann said nevertheless he said health workers will remain 
in the field long after the flashbulbs are no longer popping 
the slow slogging work of epidemiologists and educators in 
trying to contain the disease is not glamorous but is vital and is 
the only real way to fight a disease for which there is no vaccine 
and no cure speakers said 
the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
spreads most often by sexual contact or by blood or blood products 
the illness which often breaks out years after the virus has 
invaded the body damages the immune system and leaves it open to a 
variety of diseases 
speakers at sessions on the media and aids condemned 
sensationalized accounts and stories that are biased and 
judgemental and tend to blame one group for the spread of the 
disease 
inange rko an official at kenyas ministry of public health 
criticized coverage of africa by the western media as unfair and 
condemned what she called an irrelevant and unprovable effort to 
stigmatize africa as the diseases starting point 
laurie garrett a reporter for the long islandbased newspaper 
newsday and assigned to the aids beat said the media had to take a 
critical stance toward efforts to fight the disease 
the press does not try to make people use condoms thats not 
our job she said my job is to ask whether you are doing your 
job 
staub a leader of an effective campaign to encourage the use of 
condoms and safe sex among homosexuals in switzerland said 
the media are powerful enough to overrun public health messages 
with one sensational story 
i have learned that i cannot trust anyone in the media except 
for those few that are specialists in the aids story he said 
but luis pedro goicochea vergara who studied coverage of the 
epidemic in peru said health workers should accept the limits of 
the media 
its impossible to ask many newspapers in latin america to 
have specialists in aids newspapers cant afford it he said

few regulations exist to prevent a preschool 
childs frolic on playground equipment from turning into a 
potentially fatal fall even though many such hazards could be 
avoided federal health officials say 
the centers for disease control said thursday that workers at 
construction sites are protected by more safety precautions than 
children under 4 years of age on playgrounds 
a child could suffer severe head injuries or die if he fell 
headfirst onto a concrete or asphalt surface from a height of one 
foot or onto packed earth from four feet the cdc said in its 
weekly report 
if you can crack your skull from a fall from one foot off the 
ground why put concrete on the playground asked cdc 
epidemiologist jeffrey sacks were not asking a child to change 
his behavior were just saying make the environment more 
forgiving 
a four to fivefoot fall can be fatal for an adult and the 
occupational safety and health administration requires that 
guardrails be installed in some instances to protect workers as low 
as four feet above ground sacks said 
yet no regulation exists requiring safety measures to guard 
against playground falls 
although the consumer product safety commission supervises the 
equipment sacks said it does not control where it is placed the 
cdcs report said 48 percent of daycare playground equipment is 
not installed over impactabsorbing surfaces 
the cpsc regulation doesnt stop anybody from taking safe 
equipment and mounting it over broken glass sacks said and 
theres no regulation regarding that 
the cdc said the severity of injuries is reduced if a child 
falls from as high as eight feet onto energyabsorbing mats wood 
chips or sand 
the agency recommended that playground equipment be made safer 
for small children by installing it over soft surfaces locating it 
away from obstructing objects anchoring it and inspecting it 
frequently if wood chips or sand are used as surfacing they 
should not be allowed to compact or fall below an adequate depth 
most preschoolaged children with injuries involving school 
playground equipment were 3 or 4yearold boys with more injuries 
occurring in the spring months the cdc said 
according to data gathered by the cpsc about 62 million 
emergency room visits in us hospitals between 1983 and 1987 were 
productrelated injuries among preschoolers aged 14 with 305281 
involving playground equipment 
nearly 56 percent of the playground injuries to preschoolers 
happened to boys while about 45 percent involved girls the cdc 
said falls comprised 60 percent of the injuries 40 percent were 
associated with climbing twothirds of injuries occurred in the 
head and neck regions the cdc said 
the data indicated that 38 percent of preschoolers injuries 
happened at the childs home 33 percent were at day care centers 
29 percent were in sports or recreation settings and 9 percent 
were at school about 5 percent of preschool children treated for 
playgroundrelated injuries had to be hospitalized the cdc said 
this is not a bandaid situation were talking about breaking 
bones getting severe cuts sacks said many of the serious 
injuries involve falls on the head skull injuries and brain 
damage those could easily be prevented 
the cpsc obtained statistics for its analysis by using data from 
an electronic injury surveillance system located in 62 hospitals 
the study pointed out a need for measures to protect children who 
climb on playground equipment some of which is more than 10 feet 
above the ground

a senior state department official says the 
united states has no plans to withdraw troops from south korea even 
though president reagan says it might be possible to reduce the 
us military presence there 
we have no intention of anything of that sort gaston sigur 
assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs 
told reporters thursday after reagan met with south korean 
president roh taewoo 
we would have to have a firm belief on the part of our country 
and the republic of korea that the threat from north korea was 
over sigur said that threat is not over we have certainly no 
intention of changing our policy of maintaining our ground forces 
in south korea 
the president posing for pictures with roh in the rose garden 
was asked by a reporter if he could envision a time in the near 
future when the us would be reducing its military presence 
that is a possibility but it would not be one of us just 
withdrawing it would be one of being no longer needed reagan 
said 
the united states has about 42000 troops stationed in south 
korea under a mutual defense pact 
sigur said the two presidents did not discuss the subject of 
troop reduction 
he said reagan told roh that the united states fully 
supports his proposals to bring about a new atmosphere of 
reconciliation on the korean peninsula 
the two presidents discussed several steps the united states is 
considering sigur said adding that those steps would be announced 
within the next few days or so 
he said these steps would not including lifting a us ban on 
trade with north korea but could include humanitarian trade 
humanitarian aspects of relationships he declined to elaborate 
sigur said us officials feel comfortable with rohs 
proposal for a sixpower conference including the united states 
the soviet union china japan and north and south korea 
this is his initiative and its his to pursue the state 
department official said as i say we can see some merit in it 
but we have no intention of pushing it at this time 
as the visiting presidential party entered the white house the 
clashing of cymbals and beating of drums from an antiroh 
demonstration in lafayette park across pennsylvania avenue could 
be heard the demonstrators changed roh taewoo out out out 
us troops out out out

such fish as bass and lake trout would 
flourish in michigan and the great lakes shipping season would 
lengthen if the greenhouse effect warms the earth a few degrees a 
major federal study says 
the ice season on lake superior would be shortened by one month 
to three months and on lake erie by two mohths to three months 
increasing shipping seasons there said an unreleased environmental 
protection agency study that is to be submitted to the congress in 
december 
the associated press obtained a draft of a summary of the 
effects of global warming which is caused by a growing 
concentration of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in 
the atmosphere 
the gases that cause the greenhouse effect are produced mainly 
by the industries that have spread around the world since the 
mid19th century auto exhausts also contribute to the effect 
while shipping could benefit the higher temperatures likely 
would reduce the snow pack in the great lakes region and increase 
evaporation that combination would reduce lake levels possibly 
necessitating dredging ports and channels the study said 
the water level of lake superior on average would be 1 feet 
to 1 feet lower than now and lake michigans water level would 
fall dramatically by 3 feet to 8 feet the study said 
the epa study also said michigans hardwood forests might be 
replaced by savannas and grasslands because of the greenhouse 
effect which would open minnesota wisconsin and northern michigan 
to increased cultivation 
the decline of the northern forests would become evident in 30 
years to 60 years the study said 
the result by the middle of the 21st century will be an average 
global temperature of three degrees to eight degrees fahrenheit 
higher than now most scientists believe 
northern hardwood forests in michigan may be reduced to oak 
savannas or grasslands and mixed boreal and northern hardwood 
forests in northern minnesota may become all northern hardwoods 
the study said 
the reduction in forests and increased cultivation in the north 
could increase erosion and runoff harming water quality the study 
said 
and while some fish would thrive a greater temperature 
difference between the surface of the lakes and their depths might 
reduce the amount of oxygen in the lower levels and disrupt the 
annual turnover of the water the study said 
fish species in shallow lakes and rivers could suffer from the 
higher temperatures the study said 
a political effect of global warming might be increased demands 
for a diversion of great lakes water for use outside the region 
the study said

the political opposition pressing for 
policy changes that will lead to democratic reforms is hoping that 
president augusto pinochets new cabinet will have more power than 
his previous one 
all 16 members of pinochets cabinet resigned on thursday and 
the 72yearold general was expected to pick a new group of 
ministers today 
the sudden shakeup in pinochets authoritarian government came 
the same day a magazine reported that pinochets aides tried to 
delay news that chilean voters had overwhelmingly rejected him in 
the oct 5 referendum on his rule 
the reports said the purported ploy to delay the vote returns 
and then give pinochet new emergency powers were rebuffed by 
members of pinochets military junta 
government secretarygeneral orlando poblete a cabinet member 
said pinochets cabinet resigned thursday to allow the president 
to select his people and take the steps he considers proper 
following his defeat 
we have put our posts at his pinochets disposition 
poblete told reporters 
recent events make it necessary that he pinochet adjust some 
portfolios so that his team is in accord with the new stage the 
country is in poblete said 
traditionally the rightwing army commander has given little 
authority to cabinet members but opposition leaders said they 
hoped for a new interior minister with powers to negotiate 
the key is who the new interior minister will be and the 
level of autonomy he will be given socialist leader ricardo 
lagos said we know of some people who were offered the job and 
who asked for a minimal autonomy and were rejected because of that 
we dont want what happened in 1983 he added that year 
faced with civil unrest and economic crisis pinochet named a new 
interior minister to negotiate with the opposition the talks 
quickly failed and later were interpreted as a stalling tactic by 
pinochet who then declared a state of siege to crack down on 
dissidents 
pinochet lost by 800000 votes in the referendum during which 
voters were to vote yes or no on whether they wanted pinochet to 
continue as president until 1997 
the morning after the vote his cabinet handed in their 
resignations but pinochet rejected them evidently needing time to 
evaluate and pick replacements 
under the 8yearold constitution free elections are to be held 
december 1989 and a president is to take power after pinochets 
term expires in march 1990 
a 16party opposition coalition that led the campaign for 
pinochets defeat has called for several reforms in the 
constitution it maintains changes are needed for full democracy 
under the new elected government 
in the two weeks since the vote the coalitions leaders have 
said they were waiting for a cabinet change as a sign pinochet was 
willing to negotiate 
pinochet seized power in a violent 1973 coup that toppled the 
elected civilian government of president salvador allende a 
marxist 
the santiago weekly magazine que pasa reported thursday that 
pinochet aides wanted to announce selective results of the oct 5 
vote to give the impression pinochet held a big lead then launch 
progovernment street celebrations that almost certainly would have 
been violent 
the magazine said the purported ploy was rebuffed at the last 
minute by navy commander fernando matthei national police chief 
rodolfo stange and navy chief jose merino the opposition daily la 
epoca reported a similiar account of the meeting on sunday 
on election night the interior ministrys initial partial 
returns less than one percent of the vote showed him leading 
there was then a delay of several hours before it released a 
substantial tally showing his loss 
two days before the ballot the us state department disclosed 
it had information that progovernment forces might provoke 
violence as an excuse to call off the vote or annul the results

fame followed eldridge broussard jr out 
of watts and back from basketball stardom to his oncepraised 
program to lift children out of the drugs and poverty of the los 
angeles ghetto 
now his 8yearold daughter is dead allegedly at the hands of 
staff members of broussards ultradisciplinary program and 55 
other children are in protective custody 
oregon authorities say the children who were kept in a sparsely 
furnished fourbedroom farmhouse were subjected to ritualistic 
beatings of up to 800 strokes with a paddle or electrical cord the 
others were forced to watch and keep count authorities also said 
yet such is broussards popularity that parents have made no 
attempt to reclaim their children even though the youngsters were 
removed from the house a week ago according to childrens service 
division spokeswoman alice galloway 
the parents display no lack of confidence in eldridge 
broussard she says they trust him implicitly 
broussard blames the media for his daughters death and for the 
downfall of his ecclesia athletic association 
he said negative publicity when ecclesia arrived in oregon last 
year cost his group financial backing and led to suspension of its 
activities a year ago as a result broussard said there were 
fewer staff members and some were performing duties they werent 
qualified for 
the children mostly from the watts area of los angeles were 
kept in the farmhouse near sandy about 30 miles southeast of 
portland 
on oct 14 four staff members took the body of dayna broussard 
to a nearby fire station she had been beaten and whipped and died 
of multiple bluntforce injuries medical examiner larry lewman 
said 
that night 53 children were taken from the house where they 
were sharing sleeping bags on the floor investigators said the 
children ranging in age from 1 months to 16 years had eaten only 
a tomato apiece that day 
two other children involved with the group were taken into 
custody in los angeles 
the beatings were an integral part of the groups program to 
heighten athletic performance much like harassment used in 
military training said donald welch director of the clackamas 
county juvenile court 
in an appearance on oprah winfreys syndicated television talk 
show thursday broussard denied that the children were beaten or 
abused saying they were only spanked 
he said standards of discipline in oregon differ greatly from 
those in watts 
in watts parents have seen brutality that would trip the mind 
of the average american he said the people that are a part of

rescuers frustrated by a delayed 
icebreaking barge opted for a new plan to free three trapped 
whales using a helicopter to drop a 4ton concrete slab that 
could punch a trail through footthick ice today 
a large wide lead has opened four miles from the whales 
thats the closest open water theres been yet ron morris of the 
national marine fisheries service said thursday i just want to 
take advantage of the situation 
weather forecasts indicated that favorable winds would shift 
over the weekend probably shutting the pathways through the ice 
morris said 
officials said they planned to have a giant alaska army national 
guard skycrane helicopter lift the concrete crusher left over 
from the construction of the transalaska oil pipeline at first 
light today the trip was expected to take about two hours 
the guard has not abandoned its effort to tow the 185ton 
hoverbarge 230 miles to barrow but the two guard skycranes 
that towed the barge thursday have managed to move it just six 
miles from the dock at prudhoe bay in two days 
the tow was to have begun monday but was stymied by subzero 
temperatures darkness mud fueling and too much weight and after 
those problems were solved the helicopters found the going tough 
in the shallow muddy bay just outside the oil field 
by nightfall thursday a desolate stretch of more than 224 miles 
remained between the barge and the whales 
the california gray whales whose species is endangered were 
trapped during their annual migration about 100 yards off the 
treeless arctic ocean coast more than two weeks ago by the 
constantly shifting ice pack they have been breathing through 
small air holes about 18 miles northeast of this inupiat eskimo 
village 
volunteers have been using ice picks chain saws and deicers 
donated by a minnesota family business to enlarge the two original 
holes and punch new ones in the ice 
a new breathing hole was cut thursday and a tarp was placed over 
the largest of the original holes said biologist geoff carroll of 
the north slope borough 
the whales came up in a hole theyve never used before thats 
the first significant progress weve made in moving them so i 
think well go full bore on it carroll said as he headed for 
another allnight vigil on the ice 
the rescuers have recordings of killer whale calls and gray 
whale mating calls to scare or lure the trapped whales toward the 
open sea 
the animals dont seem to be as lethargic as they were earlier 
this week morris said they look nice he said i have hope 
that the whales will be around when we try to break through 
even though the whales have been trapped for more than two 
weeks morris still believes they have a 5050 chance of making it 
to their winter feeding grounds in the warm waters off southern 
california and mexico 
biologists named the whales bonnet crossbeak and bone the 
latter having much of its snout scraped away by the ice eskimos 
have given them their own names siku ice putu icehole and 
kanik snowflake 
at a news conference thursday north slope borough acting mayor 
warren matumeak said the borough is committed to freeing the 
animals even though barrow is a whaling village 
gray whales are not normally harvested by the villagers who 
rely instead mostly on bowhead whales 
no one has more respect for our native animals than the local 
hunters and we only take what we need to put food on our tables 
matumeak said 
we do not like to see animals suffer and we do not kill for 
sport these whales are suffering and need our help we feel a duty 
to do what we can and well see this effort through

a comet striking earth with the power of 300 
million hiroshimasized atomic bombs may be the cause of mass 
extinction 11 million years ago say scientists who blame a bigger 
blast for killing the dinosaurs eons earlier 
the scientists new study means that of nine mass extinction 
episodes in earths history three that occurred about 11 million 
38 million and 66 million years ago now have been linked to comets 
or asteroids smacking into the planet 
the highly controversial theory says such impacts kicked up dust 
and triggered smoky fires that blocked enough sunlight to freeze 
many creatures and deprive others of food supplies 
other new studies bolster support for rival theories that blame 
mass extinctions on gigantic volcanic eruptions on changes in sea 
level or on global climate changes unrelated to objects smashing 
into earth 
the studies are being presented at a fourday conference 
global catastrophes in earth history which opened thursday in 
snowbird utah 
scientists from lawrence berkeley laboratory and the university 
of californias berkeley and santa barbara campuses performed the 
study that suggests a comet or asteroid impact caused mass 
extinction of about 25 percent of species 10 million to 117 
million years ago the team was led by nobel prizewinning 
ucberkeley physicist luis alvarez who died last month 
in 1980 the alvarez team found thin layers of the metallic 
element iridium deposited around the world in 66millionyearold 
rocks suggesting a comet or asteroid striking earth killed about 
twothirds of all species including dinosaurs at the time 
iridium is viewed as evidence of such impacts because it is far 
more common in extraterrestrial objects than in earth rocks 
iridium in a comet that hit earth and exploded would have settled 
from airborne dust 
in the new study two deposits of iridium were found in 
10million to 12millionyearold seafloor rocks some 6200 miles 
apart in the weddell sea near antarctica and the tasman sea north 
of new zealand said frank asaro a nuclear chemist at lawrence 
berkeley laboratory 
that suggests but doesnt prove that a comet or asteroids also 
hit earth and triggered extinctions at that time he said 
the researchers estimated the comet or asteroid would have 
measured about 18 miles across and would have vaporized in an 
explosion with 300 million times the power of the 13kiloton atomic 
bomb that destroyed hiroshima at the end of world war ii asaro 
said 
he said they estimate the 6milediameter comet that killed the 
dinosaurs produced a blast 10 billion times more powerful than the 
hiroshima bomb 
in 1982 alvarezs team said iridium found in 37million to 
39millionyearold rocks may have triggered a mass extinction of 
about 25 percent of species on earth at that time 
asaro said evidence that comet or asteroid impacts caused three 
mass extinctions supports a more controversial hypothesis that 
extinctions occur at roughly 26million to 30millionyear 
intervals when comets are hurled toward earth by the gravity of an 
undiscovered companion star to the sun nicknamed the death 
star or nemesis 
other studies support the theory that huge volcanic eruptions in 
india 66 million years ago blocked out sunlight and caused mass 
extinction 
a study by florida state university scientists suggests 
shocked grains of quartz could have been produced by extremely 
explosive eruptions others say the grains were created by a comet 
smashing quartz rock another team of fsu and british scientists 
said volcanic ash found in weddell sea rocks suggests volcanoes 
caused the extinctions 
some fossil experts object to both comet and volcano theories 
arguing that mass extinctions occurred in a stepwise fashion 
with species disappearing at various times over a few million years 
as the climate or sea level changed 
extinction patterns among vertebrates do not appear to be 
attributable to any single cause catastrophic or otherwise said 
a study prepared for the snowbird meeting by j david archibald and 
laurie bryant of san diego state university 
other studies support a theory that stepwise extinctions 
occurred because one or more comet impacts killed some species 
immediately then caused acid rain and global warming that killed 
others

the friars club has banished a female colleague 
from an allmale roast for ernest borgnine citing a timehonored 
tradition despite a supreme court ruling against discrimination 
attorney gloria allred of los angeles said the clubs executive 
director jean pierre trebot denied her request to purchase a 
ticket thursday because the event featured rough language and dirty 
jokes 
when she tried to enter the roast without a ticket she was 
pushed back by a man who refused to give his name but said he 
represented the club 
why dont you act like a lady he snarled 
ms allred who joined the california friars in may 1987 filed 
a sex discrimination charge last year after she was barred from 
having lunch in the new york club 
she finally did dine at the club on aug 26 the day after the 
us supreme court upheld a new york city ordinance prohibiting 
such discrimination after the ruling the club began admitting 
some female members including liza minnelli joan rivers and 
brooke shields 
during her lunch at the club ms allred noticed the men 
only roast flyer on the wall she began a series of efforts to 
attend 
im here to do business id like to have access to the 
business contacts i could make here this is a palace of power 
said ms allred i will therefore file another charge of sex 
discrimination against the new york friars club with the 
commission 
in a statement the club said the menonly gatherings have 
been an annual tradition of the friars for the past 38 years 
the jokes are risque and the language usually quite spicy as a 
dais of celebrity comedians throw their barbs at the guest of honor 
while we admire ms allreds endeavors in the interest of 
equal rights and ending discriminatory membership practices at 
private clubs we feel her efforts to attend this years stag 
luncheon are motivated by a desire to secure media attention for 
herself 
the jokes are risque but thats not the real reason said 
hal karp a singer and friars club member who believes it is not 
the general feeling of the members that women should be banished 
from roasts 
luncheongoers said comedian buddy hackett told the 1300 
members and guests that he had hoped ms allred could attend so she 
could hear the obscene joke he told about her 
this is a roast we say mean things about each other 
hackett added after the joke 
other entertainers listed on the program included howard cosell 
norm crosby henny youngman richard belzer and foster brooks

its been a long trail from a small town in 
georgia to the university of chicago law school the presidency of 
brandeis university and partnership in a prestigious law firm in 
new york 
now at 70 morris b abram who started out in fitzgerald ga 
where there were a handful of struggling jewish families will step 
down at the end of this month as chairman of the national 
conference on soviet jewry and the conference of presidents of 
major american jewish organizations 
its been a fruitful period he said 
jewish emigration from the soviet union one of abrams concerns 
in the two jobs is on the rise through september 11238 were 
granted exit visas that is a big jump from the low point of 896 in 
1984 but less than onethird of the 51320 permitted to leave in 
1979 
that was the biggest exodus and it came under the late soviet 
president leonid i brezhnev whose record on human rights 
generally is considered below the standards set by his successor 
mikhail s gorbachev 
abram is hopeful nonetheless he says there have been some 
fundamental changes especially in the united states president 
reagan and secretary of state george p shultz have made soviet 
jewry a priority concern abram said in a telephone interview 
from his paul weiss law office in new york causing other 
governments to become associated with it 
reagan and shultz gave human rights what shultz calls pride of 
place on their agenda for the four ussoviet summits and the 
dozens of meetings shultz held with soviet foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze 
shultz always began with the topic putting it ahead even of 
nuclear arms control 
he and reagan have elicited promises that political prisoners 
would be freed and emigration rules revised and that there would be 
reforms in the soviet legal system 
shultz receiving an award a few weeks ago from the hebrew 
immigrant aid society paid tribute to abram a regular visitor to 
shultzs office on the seventh floor of the state department 
he is my rabbi shultz said you might say he has taken me 
by the hand and led me around you know how he is he is very 
gentle and sort of suggests you do this and that and persistent 
wise he has been a wonderful person for me to get to know in this 
job as secretary of state 
indeed abram is softspoken a trace of a quiet georgia accent 
remaining with him but he can be tough 
in a banquet speech in may 1987 in budapest where the world 
jewish congress was holding its first meeting on communist soil 
abram unleashed a sharp attack on the soviet union over its 
treatment of jews 
he described soviet jewry as most miserable and dejected and 
said only the existence of israel had prevented 3 million from 
disappearing down the memory hole of history 
some delegates would have preferred a more diplomatic speech as 
a way of nurturing relations between jews and eastern bloc 
countries 
abrams commitment to human rights however is not subject to 
challenge in speaking of prejudice he instinctively couples 
mistreatment of blacks with antisemitism 
abram worked with dr martin luther king and helped negotiate 
the black civil rights leaders release from an atlanta jail after 
a sitin at richs department store in 1960 
seven years later responding to an abram appeal king denounced 
as immoral rumblings of antisemitism within the black civil 
rights movement 
it is used to divide negro and jew who have effectively 
collaborated in the struggle for justice king wrote it 
injures negroes because it upholds the doctrine of racism which 
they have the greatest stake in destroying 
abram said he got a pretty good insight into prejudice in 
fitzgerald in 1922 when the ku klux klan sent an organizer to the 
town were against niggers catholics and jews the organizer 
told sheriff ej dormine offering him the klans no 1 card 
the story had a happy ending the sheriff a fundamentalist 
baptist considered abrams father sam his closest friend and 
turned the card down 
the klan leader said were going to run you out of office 
sheriff dormine told him the first time you commit any crime im 
going to run you out of town abram said and he did

bankers said 85 percent of the credit line would be backed by 
the british governments export credits guarantee department 
konstantin katushev soviet minister of economic relations said 
the british credit line as well as other credit lines recently

help modernize soviet light industry 
we have enterprises with equipment that dont meet modern 
requirements and we have enterprises which dont have enough 
capacity he said

the economic reforms enacted under president 
mikhail s gorbachev have produced a new problem how do soviet 
statisticians measure inflation 
nikolai g belov deputy director of the state committee on 
statistics said thursday that his department hasnt figured out 
how to measure the rise in the cost of living and therefore doesnt 
know how serious inflation is in the soviet union 
belov however acknowledged that wages rose nearly twice as 
fast as real income indicating inflationary forces were at play in 
the economy 
soviet officials traditionally have contended that inflation did 
not exist in the soviet union where wages and prices are 
controlled by central planners 
in other communist countries including yugoslavia poland and 
china attempts to ease central controls on the economy and permit 
the establishment of a market pricing system have led to runaway 
inflation 
fears of similar problems in the soviet system may explain 
gorbachevs hesitation in implementing price reform which he has 
said is a critical element of his modernization program 
belov speaking to reporters at a briefing said his department 
would begin calculating inflation next year 
the closest he would come to offering a figure thursday was to 
say that while wages rose 67 percent in the first nine months of 
the year real income including hidden price hikes rose 35 
percent 
prices are rising because some of the state enterprises suddenly 
ordered to make a profit have simply substituted expensive products 
for cheap ones belov said 
economic reform has also brought 1 million layoffs in the first 
nine months of 1988 although he insisted all those who lost their 
jos received new ones or were retired on pension the government 
says it does not permit unemployment 
cooperatives were the lone item of unqualified success in the 
reform that some western economists have predicted will bring the 
problems of capitalism long before bringing its benefits 
the private coops where wages consist of shared profits have 
created 700000 new jobs in the 18 months since they were 
legalized the figures showed 
in the critical area of food supplies belov acknowledged the 
soviet union is still a long way from being able to feed its people 
without substantial imports 
the production of food cannot now meet the demands of the 
population he said 
supplies reaching the stores the most significant figure in a 
nation where vast amounts of food rot in the field or on the road 
to market are rising but are still 2 billion short of needs 
belov said 
many of belovs statistics appeared glowing but meant little 
without accounting for inflation for example he said industrial 
production rose 102 percent but he could not say how much was 
simply higher prices for the same goods 
belov admitted an alarming trend of salaries rising more 
than productivity which western economists would consider a danger 
sign for inflation wages rose 67 percent while productivity 
increased 52 percent the first nine months 
on the farm front belov said grain production will be slightly 
less than the past two years official figures indicate the harvest 
produced 210 million tons of grain last year and 211 million tons 
the year before excellent by soviet standards 
belov also said imports have risen 48 percent while exports are 
unchanged the soviet union has expanded purchases of western 
technology in hopes of modernizing its factories

the dollar slipped against the japanese yen in 
tokyo today while stock prices rose slightly on the tokyo stock 
exchange 
the dollar opened at 12655 yen and stayed in a range of 
1262012675 yen in lackluster trading the currency finished the 
days trading at 12640 yen down 075 yen from thursdays close of 
12715 yen 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues gained 1087 points or 004 percent to close at 
2740142 
dealers said the bearish dollar in tokyo reflected the 
currencys poor showing in new york and london overnight 
the decline in oil prices and doubt over the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries ability to agree on production 
limits also added to the dollars downward trend dealers said 
there were not many negative incentives in tokyo today said 
yoshikazu kotooge of yasuda trust bank the slight decline after 
opening was due to heavy sales of the dollar by securities and 
trust firms 
dealers said they expect the dollar will remain at 126yen level 
because it was being bought back in the low 126s 
securities dealers attributed the strong performance of shares 
on the tokyo stock exchange to the 4392point gain in the dow 
jones industrial average in new york overnight and the sense of 
relief felt by market participants after the first anniversary of 
the worldwide market crash on oct 19 1987 
the market finally got rid of the pressure after the crash 
anniversary passed peacefully said mike morizumi of merrill 
lynch in tokyo 
dealers also said the japanese parliamentary debate on a new 
capitalgain tax and a widening stock scandal involving 
politicians purchases of unlisted stocks is pulling share prices 
they also said uncertainty caused by emperor hirohitos illness 
was still hurting the market 
investors always hate uncertainties and stay away from them

the leftist government sharply 
restricted civil liberties with a vaguely worded state of 
emergency citing the threat of hurricane joan opposition figures 
said the sandinistas were using the storm for political ends 
the 30day state of emergency signed thursday by president 
daniel ortega suspends several articles of the constitution 
guaranteeing freedom of expression the full breadth of the decree 
was not immediately known 
the national emergency decree allows for censorship and 
restricts all communications media from publishing or airing news 
on hurricane joan unless it is given out by the presidency or 
authorized sources 
the decree also said the government could temporarily utilize 
whatever resources needed to counter the effects of the hurricane 
that section was interpreted as meaning authorities could 
confiscate anything from cars to buildings 
the decree was announced as joan with heavy rains and winds 
topping 100 mph crept within 225 miles of nicaraguas atlantic 
coast thousands of people were evacuated thursday from regions 
near bluefields 
a state of emergency is decreed in all the national territory 
in view of the threat of hurricane joan to nicaragua the decree 
said 
the decree said an article of the constitution was suspended 
that said nicaraguans have the right to freely express their 
beliefs in public or private individually or collectively in 
oral written or any other form 
the order also suspends an article that says nicaraguans have 
the right to truthful information this right compromises the 
freedom to seek receive and disseminate information and ideas be 
they spoken or written in graphic or any other chosen form 
the government imposed a strict state of emergency law in 1982 
shortly after an escalation in the war with usbacked rebels 
known as contras the restrictions which barred public gatherings 
and sharply limited expression and movement were lifted in january 
to comply with the august 1987 central american peace plan 
opposition leaders denounced the new decree thursday night 
enrique sotelo borgen a member of the conservative party said 
in an interview that the law was a move by the government to assert 
its control 
the act by the sandinista regime is suspect of political 
repression sotelo borgen said they are taking advantage of a 
possible catastrophe to impose absolute domination over the 
public 
luis guzman a member of the popular social christian party 
expressed similar sentiments its just to take advantage there 
is nothing that justifies 30 days he said 
the opposition leaders declined to speculate further on the 
motives for the restrictions 
under existing law the president can declare a state of 
emergency in times of war economic crisis and national catastrophe

china will restrict further industrial expansion 
in agricultural areas to halt a loss of arable land that threatens 
the nations ability to feed itself an official newspaper reported 
today 
chen ye a senior official in the state land administration was 
quoted by the china daily as saying a quota system will be adopted 
industries in such fields as mining power generation airports 
railways oil wells and textiles will need special permission from 
the administration for new projects using land exceeding their land 
quotas she said 
land and industry experts are now working out details of the new

million tons of grain annually by the year 2000 to keep up with 
population growth and improving living standards output has

who won the best actress oscar this year for her role in

an attorney says perus stateowned mineral 
company views a 17 million check from lamar hunt as the first 
installment from the three hunt brothers who a jury found 
plotted to corner the world silver market 
minpeco sa the peruvian minerals concern has been unable to 
collect any part of the 13245 million jury award from nelson 
bunker hunt 62 and william herbert hunt 59 because they filed 
for personal bankruptcy protection in dallas late last month 
the three brothers all from dallas and sons of the late oil 
billionaire hl hunt were sued by minpeco in federal court here 
minpeco lawyers said they would ask bankruptcy court in dallas 
today to unfreeze the hunts assets so minpeco can pursue 
collection efforts against them 
lamar hunt the 56yearold owner of the kansas city chiefs 
professional football team paid the 17 million thursday to settle 
his part of the finding that the brothers tried to corner the world 
silver market 
under the settlements terms the jury findings against lamar 
hunt were dismissed by us district judge morris e lasker who 
approved the agreement lamar hunts attorney paul curran told 
lasker his client was settling the matter because he wanted to 
put an end to the very heavy legal and emotional costs of this 
litigation 
curran maintained the settlement did not alter hunts contention 
that he did nothing wrong 
hunt who attended the brief hearing in a nearly empty 
courtroom declined to comment referring reporters to a statement 
issued by his kansas city mo office 
in spite of the fact that the claims against me were totally 
unwarranted the statement said because of the uncertainties 
of litigation and the substantial cost associated with further 
proceedings i made the business decision to put the litigation 
behind me so that i can spend my time pursuing positive business 
interests 
a lawyer representing about 17000 investors who are suing the 
hunts and others in two large classaction suits complained to 
lasker about certain aspects of the settlement 
attorney herbert deutsch noted that under the settlement the 
minpeco verdict against lamar hunt could not be used in the 
classaction lawsuits and the allegations would have to be proven 
all over again effectively nullifying the 6month trial of the 
lawsuit 
but lasker said he was pleased to approve the settlement 
after the check was turned over minpeco attorney mark cymrot 
said we view this as the first installment payment by the 
hunts 
the filings last month by bunker and herbert hunt under chapter 
11 of the federal bankruptcy law were intended to protect the 
brothers assets from creditors including minpeco while they 
reorganize their finances 
bunker hunt was once considered the worlds wealthiest man with 
an estimated worth of 16 billion in the 1960s 
the federal jury found last august that the hunts and other 
investors were part of an unsuccessful scheme nine years ago to 
corner the silver market 
minpeco had claimed it lost more than 100 million after the 
silver market collapsed in march 1980 
before the trial began in february minpeco collected nearly 
647 million in settlements from other defendants including 
merrill lynch co prudentialbache securities and ef hutton amp 
co

a dominican priest who espouses a new age 
brand of catholicism said a yearlong public silence imposed by the 
vatican is the act of an unhealthy institution that may even be 
already dead 
the rev matthew fox founder of the 11yearold institute for 
culture and creation spirituality said he would abide by the 
sentence of silence that begins dec 15 for as long as he could 
but he lashed out at the vatican charging that its apparent 
intolerance of his views were those of a patriarchal church 
already demonstrating the characteristics of a dysfunctional 
family 
the promise of openness of collegiality of the trust of the 
spirit operating among those working in the world has been 
forsaken by the church on behalf of a rigid authoritarianism 
fox said at a thursday morning news conference 
fox said such an institution is no longer healthy it may even 
be already dead he suggested the catholic church will die as an 
institution unless it adopts democratic practices adding that he 
eventually may be forced to renounce his priesthood because of his 
views 
the internationally known author and lecturer said he will take 
at least a sixmonth sabbatical although his dominican superiors 
in rome and chicago recommended a minimum of one year he will 
travel to latin america but would not say what his plans would be 
after that 
although reacting angrily to the order fox said he considered 
it an honor that places him in the company of galileo and thomas 
aquinas who were ordered silenced by the church in their lifetimes 
the punishment from the vaticans congregation for the doctrine 
of faith headed by cardinal joseph ratzinger prohibits the 
47yearold priest from preaching lecturing or teaching he can 
write but not publish 
the vatican called foxs esoteric mix of christian mysticism 
feminism and environmentalism dangerous and deviant teachings 
those include criticisms of traditional church doctrine for an 
overemphasis on sin and redemption calling god a mother 
endorsements of various forms of pantheism and support for 
homosexuals 
fox has said he favors optional celibacy for catholic priests 
and the ordination of women both are major deviations from the 
roman catholic churchs positions 
he also has irked conservative catholics by hiring faculty 
members who include a certified masseuse a zen buddhist a yoga 
teacher and a selfdescribed witch named starhawk 
the controversy over foxs silencing may further strain 
relations between some members of the us church and rome some 
catholic officials indicated 
those relations already are tense because of ratzingers 1986 
order to dismiss the rev charles curran from the catholic 
university faculty in washington for holding views on sexual ethics 
that deviate from traditional church teaching and romes 
disciplining of liberal seattle archbishop raymond hunthausen for 
apparent laxity in pastoral administration 
the national catholic reporter an independent paper that first 
reported the silencing last week said in an editorial in todays 
editions 
people cannot be told to stop thinking or recording their 
thoughts silencing efforts come from another time 
the us dominicans have not condemned fox instead they 
concluded after a special threeperson commission reviewed his work 
in 1984 that he was not a heretic said the rev john gerlack of 
the orders headquarters in chicago 
the commission had minor criticisms some suggestions that 
things should be qualified or balanced but in the end the 
conclusion was there was not sufficient reason that he should be 
condemned for heresy or condemned or silenced gerlack said

nevada gaming officials are considering 
whether to continue to allow slot machines that tempt gamblers by 
appearing to just miss a jackpot 
but an attorney for the machines japanese distributor said 
thursday the nearmiss devices only make things more exciting 
the 15000 universal distributing video slots used in most 
nevada casinos randomly choose symbols on the lines being played 
but are programmed to show winning combinations on nonpaying 
lines if a player puts two coins in a fiveline machine those 
lines will come up with random spins but the remaining three lines 
can be programmed to show a jackpot 
although the nearmiss machines have been banned in atlantic 
city they have been used here for three years and are leading the 
industry in the latest technology to make slot machines more 
entertaining frank schreck an attorney for the company said 
thursday 
the company has made playing slot machines exciting again 
schreck said theres nothing deceptive about it this is what 
gambling is about everybody knows that in the end the odds are 
theyll lose but the possibility of winning makes it more 
exciting 
the nevada gaming commission is planning to review whether to 
allow universal to retain the nearmiss feature on its 15000 
machines among nevadas 100000 slots no date has been set for a 
hearing on the issue 
the review is part of a stipulation nevada gaming officials and 
universal entered into last month following a complaint against the 
company filed by the nevada gaming control board in april 
the complaint said the tokyobased company was deceptive in 
allegedly hiding the nearmiss feature from gaming regulators when 
the machines were approved in 1985 
schreck said the feature was described in the documents filed 
with nevada but officials obviously didnt study all the 
information we gave to them 
new jersey officials however did review the nearmiss computer 
program in that states slot machine lab and outlawed it 
it was to entice the player to play more lines explained 
anthony parrillo director of the new jersey division of gaming 
enforcement 
last year universals video slot machines were allowed into 
atlantic city but without the nearmiss program he said 
nevada gaming control board chairman mike rumbolz said the board 
had not taken an official position on the slots and a final 
determination on the nearmiss features use would be up to the 
commission to decide 
new jerseys parrillo has said his staff tipped nevadas gaming 
officials to universals nearmiss program but both universal and 
nevada gaming regulators have denied that 
we discovered it through continuing testing in our 
laboratory rumbolz told the atlantic city press

critics are denouncing the governments proposal 
to scrap a crime suspects right to remain silent a legal maneuver 
aimed at battling the irish republican army and other northern 
ireland guerrilla groups 
the government will not defeat terrorism by taking away one of 
the few remaining safeguards in northern irelands justice 
system sarah spencer general secretary of britains national 
council for civil liberties 
the plan to remove the centuriesold right to silence was 
announced thursday in the house of commons by northern ireland 
secretary tom king the cabinet member responsible for the province 
the government of the republic of ireland said in a statement 
that it was worried at the implications of the move to end the 
right to silence for the administration of justice in northern 
ireland 
paddy mcmanus legal affairs spokesman for the iras legal 
political party sinn fein said kings announcement moved britain 
closer into line with south africa and chile both widely condemned 
for human rights abuses 
the government also hinted thursday that it may make candidates 
for elections in the province take an oath renouncing violence 
on wednesday the government imposed a ban on television and 
radio interviews with the ira and 10 other militant northern 
ireland groups including four protestant organizations to deny 
the guerrillas what it said was a propaganda platform 
the government said thursday it plans to introduce legal changes 
by 1990 to impose similar restrictions on the right of suspects to 
remain silent in england and wales scotland is unaffected at 
least at present because it has its own legal system 
like the broadcast ban the new measure was part of a security 
package promised by the government after a surge in killings and 
bombings by the mainly roman catholic ira since spring 
the ira is fighting to end british rule in predominantly 
protestant northern ireland and unite it with the predominately 
catholic republic of ireland under socialist rule protestant 
militants oppose all suggestion of unity with the republic 
kings announcement was contained in what is known as a draft 
order in council presented to the commons under present law the 
right of suspects under police questioning to remain silent cannot 
be used against them at trials 
under kings draft order which must be approved by parliament 
to become law suspects will still be able to stay silent under 
police questioning if they wish 
but the order proposes to allow courts in future to attach 
whatever weight they think proper to the fact that someone remained 
silent when questioned that means prosecution lawyers for the 
first time will be able to draw attention to a suspects silence as 
a possible indication of guilt 
the draft order will be debated by parliament next month the 
governments 101seat majority in the 650seat commons guarantees 
its passage and it is expected to become law next year 
king told reporters members of terrorist organizations are 
being trained to refuse to respond to questions put by the police 
and this technique is increasingly being adopted by those suspected 
of serious crimes including racketeering justice is being 
thwarted 
opposition labor party deputy leader roy hattersley said the 
right to silence was an essential element of a free society 
labors northern ireland spokesman kevin mcnamara said 
northern ireland is being used as a laboratory for draconian 
measures to be used later in other parts of the united kingdom

jordans king hussein says he is encouraged by a 
proposal from israeli foreign minister shimon peres that could 
revive possibility of an international conference aimed at solving 
the palestinian crisis 
abc television reported thursday night that peres who is 
running for prime minister has proposed to hussein that jordan and 
the palestine liberation organization form a joint delegation for 
the proposed conference 
hussein interviewed from jordan by abcs nightline program 
said he regarded the proposal to be interesting to be a step 
forward much more clear than any previous positions and is thus a 
welcome development 
however i cannot at this point in time say that jordan is in 
any position to alter its position or stance of course we have 
made it abundantly clear and would repeat that again now that we 
are prepared if the palestinians seek it to go to an 
international conference in a joint delegation which represents 
the people of palestine 
the israelioccupied west bank formerly was ruled by jordan and 
jordan had continued to pay the salary of civil servants there 
after israel occupied it in 1967 
however hussein in august severed jordans ties with the west 
bank the move was seen as a blow to israeli moderates who had 
welcomed jordans attempts to moderate the plos more radical 
stance 
asked whether he had actually agreed to take part in a joint 
delegation with the plo hussein said there have been no 
contacts or discussions in any detail there was an outline of 
their position and i am responding to it by showing our readiness

adrienne a 600pound sow sentenced to 
become sausage was granted a reprieve when a save the pig 
campaign allowed her to become a permanent exhibit for 
schoolchildren 
dale engquist superintendent of the indiana dunes national 
lakeshore made the decision after receiving petitions bearing 300 
signatures asking that adrienne be spared 
the announcement means adrienne will remain a permanent resident 
of the lakeshores chellberg farm a national park service working 
exhibit that is popular among schoolchildren 
lakeshore personnel work the farm much as the chellberg family 
did at the turn of the century because of that adrienne was 
scheduled to be sold and butchered 
when adriennes fans found out about it they began an emotional 
save the pig campaign that included the petition drive 
all the kids are going to be so happy said susie cutler a 
chicago attorney who spearheaded the campaign were very happy 
that the park could accommodate adrienne and listened to all the 
people who cared about her 
engquist said the lakeshores revised hog plan calls for 
adrienne to remain at the farm as an exhibit to demonstrate how 
large a pig can get 
all you have to do is stand there and watch both youngsters 
and adults gasp when they go up to adrienne and see how big a pig 
can be engquist said

the foreign secretary who negotiated 
a new agreement on us bases in the philippines said today that 
the united states should have paid more to keep its garrisons on 
philippine soil 
raul manglapus who returned to manila today after signing the 
agreement in washington four days earlier said he was sorry that 
not all the issues put on the table were resolved 
manglapus cited as unresolved the issues of filipino criminal 
jurisdiction over the 40000 us troops and dependents based in 
the islands and philippine control over american military 
operations launched from the bases 
later manglapus briefed president corazon aquino on the 
agreement no statement was issued after the closeddoor session 
about 3000 people rallied today in a downtown square to protest 
the bases accord and the recent slaying of a leftist labor leader 
on mindanao island the crowd carried banners denouncing the 
agreement as a sellout and demanded the bases be closed 
a statement by the leftwing new patriotic alliance distributed 
during the march urged the public to make known their opposition 
to the new agreement 
the agreement signed monday by manglapus and secretary of state 
george shultz allows the bases to remain until 1991 in return for 
962 million in aid over the final two years of the accord 
manglapus said the filipino panel initially asked for 23 
billion a year as well as other concessions that were not granted 
asked if he was satisfied with the agreement manglapus replied 
no we should have gotten 23 billion a year 
but our committee recognized you have a maximum and a minimum 
we got the minimum he said 
mondays accord amended the 1947 military bases agreement under 
which the united states maintains clark air base subic bay naval 
base and four smaller installations 
the original agreement expires on sept 16 1991 after that 
any extension must be by formal treaty approved by twothirds of 
the 23member senate where opposition to the bases is strong 
mrs aquino has not said whether she will support an extension 
the united states has been paying 180 million a year for use of 
the bases americas largest in southeast asia 
despite the increase there has been widespread public 
disappointment with the compensation because the government 
repeatedly promised to hold out for a significantly higher figure 
than it eventually accepted 
critics said the outcome of the talks which began april 5 
would increase opposition to the bases among the 56 million 
filipinos

emperor hirohito broke out in a rash while 
receiving blood today forcing doctors to halt the transfusion but 
palace spokesmen said his condition remained stable and no signs of 
internal bleeding were reported 
doctors had planned to give the emperor 042 pints of blood 
but stopped at 032 pints as the emperor developed a rash 
imperial household agency spokesman kenji maeda told reporters 
he said the doctors believe the rash which soon went away was 
a reaction to incompatible elements in the blood and would not 
affect future transfusions 
the 87yearold emperor seemed to be in good spirits and 
conversed with several family members who visited him during the 
day said an agency source who requested anonymity 
the transfusions seem to be improving his anemia the source 
said 
though no discharge was reported today hirohito has passed a 
small amount of blood from his bowels each day for the past six 
days on wednesday he coughed up blood for the first time since his 
condition worsened on sept 19 
todays transfusion brought the total amount of blood the frail 
emperor has received in the past month to 2312 pints about three 
times the normal amount in his body 
palace officials have said doctors suspect past internal 
bleeding has come from the area of hirohitos upper intestine

two mild earthquakes hit northern california while a moderately 
strong temblor a continent away jarred parts of maine and new 
hampshire but authorities in both regions reported no injuries or 
damage 
the weston observatory in weston mass said the new england 
quake measured 40 on the richter scale enough to cause moderate 
damage and the us geological survey in menlo park calif said 
the temblor measured 39 on the richter scale walter anderson 
director of the maine geological survey said the difference in the 
two readings could be regarded as insignificant 
it shook the whole house pictures on the wall everything in 
it went flopping back and forth said 78yearold leo perron a 
resident of berlin nh near the quakes epicenter 
i thought it was a load of lumber falling said sandy 
endicott a secretary at ph chadbourne amp co lumber yard in 
bethel maine 
thursdays quake struck at 909 am and was centered five miles 
northeast of berlin the weston observatory said 
authorities said rumblings and booms were reported all the way 
from central new hampshire to yarmouth on the maine coast to 
augusta in the southcentral part of maine 
police in berlin received more than 100 telephone calls thursday 
morning after the quake but no reports of damage 
in california one quake measuring 39 on the richter scale 
occurred near the geysers area about 50 miles north of san 
francisco about 1030 am thursday the university of california 
seismographic station at berkeley reported 
the other with a 33 magnitude occurred near garberville 
about 180 miles north of san francisco about 420 pm according 
to the seismographic station 
sheriffs departments in sonoma and humboldt counties and the 
state office of emergency services said there were no reports of 
damage or injuries 
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph 
a quake of magnitude 2 is the is the smallest normally felt by 
humans a quake of magnitude 35 can cause slight damage and a 
quake of magnitude 4 can cause moderate damage every increase of 
one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude a reading of 45 
reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 35 the san 
francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before the richter 
scale was devised has been estimated at 83

bulgarias communist government plans 
to sell shares of its publicowned enterprises to foreign investors 
as part of the widespread economic changes sweeping eastern europe 
a us official says 
deputy secretary of state john whitehead said that during his 
trip to bulgaria president todor zhivkov disclosed plans to turn 
governmentowned enterprises into corporations that will offer 
stock to their employees and other investors 
marx would have turned over in his grave if he could have 
heard comrade zhivkov talk that way whitehead told reporters 
after discussing his sixnation trip with officials of the north 
atlantic treaty organization in brussels 
german economist karl marx developed the doctrine that the state 
should control production for the benefit of the workers a theory 
on which the communist economies have been based 
bulgaria has traditionally been the soviet unions most loyal 
satellite in eastern europe and changes there likely reflect soviet 
approval 
whitehead said there is change everywhere in eastern europe 
that is the key word of my conclusions economic change political 
change and social change 
the changes he said are occurring most rapidly in hungary and 
poland less so in czechoslovakia bulgaria and east germany and 
hardly at all in romania 
the new initiatives he said are bringing more democracy 
pluralism freemarket economies and decentralization to those 
countries 
he said bulgaria is moving on a rapid course of change in a 
very sound way particularly economic change there is less 
political change but i think that that will follow and there is 
even less change in their human rights performance but i think that 
that will follow 
he said he met with zhivkov for five hours earlier in the week 
and was told about the new law on public enterprises that will go 
into effect on jan 1 
those corporations he said will become stockholder 
corporations like our western stockholder corporations and 
employees will be able to buy shares in the corporation that they 
work in 
whitehead singled out romania for sharp criticism as he did 
earlier in his travels 
its very hard to find any bright spots in romania he said 
he said he was appalled by a trip he made to see the razing 
of villages carried out as part of a land reform program by 
president nicolae ceausescus government 
he said villagers were being removed from their homes to live in 
barrackslike bleak public housing buildings with no running 
water no bathrooms and very tiny quarters for each family 
its an outrageous violation of the rights of the romanian 
people to have that practice he said adding the world should 
let him ceausescu know how they feel about this

a computer virus has infected programs at a 
leading software publisher for the second time in eight months 
despite efforts to prevent a recurrence officials say 
the virus which turned up in a version of aldus corps 
freehand drawing program also got into a computer network at the 
companys headquarters here aldus said 
no programs for sale to the public were infected and the virus 
has been eradicated aldus spokeswoman laury bryant said thursday 
software companies cant always protect themselves from stuff 
coming in but we can say unequivocally that we do everything we 
can to make sure they dont go out ms bryant said 
viruses are computer programs created by programmers as jokes 
or acts of vandalism that secretly attach themselves to other 
programs the virus can then spread from computer to computer when 
operators share infected software 
at their most benign viruses merely flash a message on a 
computer screen at their worst they can destroy information 
stored in computer memories or cripple a machine 
two viruses all but paralyzed the work of hundreds of students 
and faculty at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh officials 
said thursday 
last month a former fort worth texas programmer was convicted 
of planting a virus in his employers computer system in the first 
such conviction in the nation two days after the employee was 
fired the virus activated erasing 168000 company records 
aldus officials said their new virus dubbed nvir has 
remained dormant so far attaching itself to other programs 
we dont know why we dont know what invokes this virus 
dauber said with some of them you have to launch the program a 
certain number of times for the virus to activate 
aldus said it does not know where the virus originated 
ms bryant said the infection did not do the company any 
financial damage because no retail copies were involved and that it 
would not affect plans to ship the updated version of freehand 
later this year 
the first infection occurred in march when a peace message 
turned up in an earlier version of freehand the message did no 
harm to computers flashing a brief message on computer screens 
before dying out 
the incident shocked computer experts who until then had 
thought viruses could be avoided if users didnt freely exchange 
software but only used offtheshelf programs the infection 
forced aldus to recall or rework thousands of packages of the new 
software 
aldus and other major software producers have since adopted 
rigorous testing methods including the use of vaccine programs 
designed to seek out viruses aldus also has isolated from possible 
contamination the machines that reproduce its software ms bryant 
said 
still the virus was found in versions of the updated freehand 
program that had been sent to specific users to be tested before 
the program was offered for sale 
aldus said it had shipped infected disks to a dozen businesses 
and users around the country one of those users discovered the 
virus and notified the company 
aldus said the virus also was found in its qualityassurance 
computer network 
nvir eluded a number of vaccines ms dauber said it was 
finally revealed by a new detection program which was not in use 
when the test versions were shipped out

an estimated 50000 worth of anabolic steroids 
seized by federal agents may have been intended for high school 
athletes authorities said after breaking up what they called a 
major international smuggling ring 
the steroids confiscated wednesday in denvers suburbs were for 
veterinary use and unfit for human consumption but some still may 
have been sold to young athletes acting us attorney mike norton 
said thursday 
the operation was the second steroid bust in eight days on oct 
12 steven w smith of denver was arrested on charges of selling 
steroids without prescriptions 
anabolic steroids are used legally to treat bone pain in 
osteoporosis and hypogonadism among other things but athletes 
sometimes use the drug illegally to build muscles and improve 
performance 
officials said they believe the ring operated for five years 
bringing in 500000 worth of steroids manufactured in mexico for 
distribution throughout colorado wyoming utah and nebraska 
those arrested appeared before us magistrate richard b harvey 
late wednesday on charges of smuggling conspiracy money 
laundering and violations of the us food and drug act officials 
said 
they were identified as steve lower 25 a high school gym 
teacher and owner of a tanning salon kristy greenwood 20 bradley 
meyer 23 david faulk 22 robert shine 27 and michael remy 29 
the smuggling charges carry prison sentences of up to five years 
and fines up to 250000 other charges may be filed against the 
suspects after evidence is presented to a federal grand jury the 
week of nov 14 norton said 
authorities said six vehicles were seized during the raids 
im glad they caught them said denver broncos coach dan 
reeves i hope they proscute them steroids are very detrimental 
to the health of anybody who uses them particularly young people 
reeves said he knows steroid use is widespread among area high 
school athletes black marketeers are making a profit and 
couldnt care less about the damage theyre doing to our young 
people he said 
side effects include permanent deepening of the voice and hair 
growth in females decreased sperm count for men liver disorders 
changes in blood pressure changes in cholesterol distribution 
irritability aggression disturbed sleep patterns and changes in

three people were hurt in the incidents none seriously when 
their vehicles were hit by the blocks thrown from overpasses

heroes said state trooper daniel cosgrove they were getting a 
kick out it this its kind of sick to do it 
attorneys for michael havekost 18 and david domanski 25 on 
thursday blamed each others clients for being more responsible for 
the incidents which occurred last month 
i think you will find the link that led to these aberrational 
crimes is mr domanski said mark malone an attorney for 
havekost 
domanskis lawyer herbert korn acknowledged his client was 
present during the incidents but said the rock throwing was done by 
havekost 
when we get down to the charges the facts will show the 
actual person who committed these crimes was the other suspect 
korn said 
havekost of warren township is a member of the millington 
rescue squad and passaic first aid squad domanski of passaic 
township is a member of the millington volunteer fire department 
both were charged thursday with six counts of attempted murder each 
and arraigned in somerset county superior court they were held in 
the somerville county jail after failing to post 150000 bail 
cosgrove said witnesses reported that a black sports car would 
appear on the scene to offer aid after each incident 
it turns out mr domanski owns a 1988 pontiac firebird similar 
to the car described by witnesses he said 
the two men were arrested by passaic police last week on arson 
charges and released cosgrove said during questioning one of the 
suspects mentioned involvement with the cinder block incidents and 
the state troopers were called in he said 
cosgrove said it was not immediately clear why the two were 
released after being linked to the cinder block throwing

a black zulu leader whom the 
government had hoped to draw into negotiations denounced president 
pw botha today as a racist who has shamed south africa 
mangosuthu buthelezis speech in kwazulu a black homeland which 
he governs was probably his harshest attack ever on botha and 
suggested that reconciliation between the two was unlikely 
buthelezi was responding to sharp criticism leveled at him by 
botha during a political speech thursday night in benoni near 
johannesburg 
in an aggressive address botha also attacked the news media 
the countrys topranking mixedrace politician and the white 
rugby administrators who recently held talks with african national 
congress guerrilla leaders 
it shames south africa that the state president has stooped to 
make personal attacks on me buthelezi told the kwazulu 
legislature this is absolutely disgraceful personality 
assassination 
he said members of bothas national party would be appalled 
that mr botha showed the racist face he showed in benoni 
personalizing his political problems and placing them on my 
shoulders in a racist kind of way is even more appalling than it is 
unwarranted buthelezi said 
botha in his speech criticized buthelezi for refusing to 
cooperate with proposals to give blacks a limited advisory role in 
central government the president described buthelezi as misled 
and misused and suggested the zulus were beset by a long history 
of intratribal conflict 
repeatedly in recent years the government has tried to draw 
buthelezi into negotiations on limited powersharing with blacks 
buthelezi has refused to participate saying the government must 
first free jailed african national congress leader nelson mandela 
and ease political restrictions on black opposition groups 
the government says it is willing to negotiate a new 
constitution in which the black majority now excluded from 
national politics would have a formal role however botha says he 
would never accept a oneman onevote system or black majority 
rule 
under apartheid the 5 million whites also control the economy 
and maintain separate districts schools and health services from 
those of the 26 million blacks 
buthelezi despite his resistance to government overtures is 
unpopular with militant antiapartheid activists he criticizes the 
use of violence by the anc and opposes confrontational tactics such 
as sanctions strikes and boycotts

severed by a light pole bled to death while the driver recklessly 
sped around asking people if they knew where he could dump the

fiat passed close to a light pole severing the passengers arm at 
the elbow the limb was left on the road as the driver sped away 
said sgt bob duncan of the florida highway patrol 
ten blocks away the car drove another vehicle off the road and 
again left the accident scene duncan said 
minutes later with the passenger still slumped in the front 
seat the driver stopped at a trash bin and told two people he had 
killed a man and was looking for a place to dump the body police 
said 
officers immediately began a blockbyblock foot search in the

a beirut magazine said today the united 
states and iran were working out a deal for freeing nine american 
hostages before the us presidential election on nov 8 
the weekly ashshiraa said the hostages would be freed to ensure 
victory for vice president george bush in exchange for a commitment 
from the republican candidate to rearm iran after he takes office 
there was no way to verify the report 
ashshiraa which has access to iranian hardliners gained 
international fame when it broke the story of the secret us arms 
sales to iran in november 1986 but its subsequent reports about 
the hostages including reports of an imminent release proved 
inaccurate 
other reports have said both bush and democrat candidate michael 
dukakis sent envoys to work out a deal with iran on the hostages 
but washington has denied any contact was under way with iran 
the nine americans are among 14 foreign hostages in lebanon 
most believed held by shiite moslem radicals linked to iran the 
longest held is american terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
ashshiraa said a new deal has been in the works for a while 
between the united states and iran under which iran would free the 
american hostages held by its factions in lebanon before the 
upcoming american elections to ensure the victory of the republican 
candidate vice president george bush 
in return bush will undertake to forge a new policy in the 
region making iran its main cornerstone after israel as the case 
was during the era of the late shah mohammed reza pahlavi 
the scenario also requires iran to recover its military might 
with particular support from the us and the west in general so 
that it will be able to go back to war against iraq as soon as 
possible to score battlefield victories that would redeem the 
prestige of the iranian army 
after a series of battlefield defeats iran in july accepted a 
un ceasefire in its eightyear war with iraq

polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
today told progovernment worker activists that forthcoming talks 
with the opposition may lead to a breakthrough in national 
reconciliation 
but a party official told the same meeting we cannot give in 
to political blackmail which is the pressure for relegalization of 
solidarity 
solidarity officials have said that legalizing the union 
movement banned after the 1981 martiallaw crackdown is their 
foremost demand at the talks 
about 500 worker activists chosen by authorities were invited to 
the meeting at the ursus tractor factory just outside of warsaw 
the state news agency pap said 
we are facing a great chance of making a breakthrough in the 
process of national agreement pap quoted jaruzelski as saying 
that is why at this moment the party asks the working class for 
its opinions 
the talks could begin this month said andrzej gdula head of 
the sociallegal department of the polish united workers 
communist party 
we speak for one trade union in one enterprise said gdula 
whose speech was reported by state radio 
the party is not against the idea of union pluralism in the 
long run gdula said however in order for pluralism to be a 
fact appropriate political relations must be created 
the party has argued that political reforms should be 
implemented and tried out first before the more volatile issue of 
legalizing solidarity is addressed 
the opposition wants solidarity legalized from the outset of any 
agreement as a guarantee of the authorities interest in reform 
gdula said the talks were threatened by recent street 
demonstrations and boycotts organized at various universities 
despite these threats the party believes that the idea of 
reconciliation will win and common sense will win there is a 
chance that the round table will start its activities yet this 
month he said 
the opposition says it wants the talks agreed to during a wave 
of strikes in august to lead to legalization of the solidarity 
trade union and greater political and economic freedom 
but gdula said thinking that all problems will be solved 
during the talks is illusory convergence of views should take 
place about how to solve our problems 
he said the meeting would lead to a council for national 
reconciliation which would have representatives of the opposition 
and government it could also lead to changes in the electoral law 
for choosing a new parliament next year he said

welfare recipients will be able to collect 
their benefits through cash machines starting next summer 
washington state officials say 
jule sugarman secretary of the department of social and health 
services said a 185000 grant from the us department of 
agriculture was being used to develop an electronic benefit 
transfer demonstration project for distributing cash and 
authorizations for food purchases and medical treatment in pierce 
county 
under the program similar to a sixmonth experiment that began 
last month for unemployed workers to collect jobless benefits by 
cash machines welfare recipients will be issued plastic debit 
cards and personal identification numbers 
they could then use the cards and numbers to draw cash against 
their accounts from 140 cash machines in the county some 400 
grocery stores would accept the cards in place of food stamps and 
the debit cards also would be good at nearly 1800 medical offices 
said frank mendizabal an agency spokesman 
he said the money would be available through cash machines on 
the last day of each month eliminating the three to five days of 
waiting for checks to arrive in the mail and cutting administrative 
costs 
it is an effort to make it a more efficient system for us and 
the recipients mendizabal explained

using the long march rocket not use unfair pricing according to a 
us embassy statement 
reagan announced sept 9 the conditions for granting export 
licenses for the communist nation to launch the satellites 
after four days of talks the two countries reached agreement on 
establishing safeguards to protect sensitive satellite technology 
and on setting chinas liability in case of an accident the 
statement said without elaboration 
next months talks will focus on launch services pricing and 
capacity as the united states seeks assurances that satellite 
exports to china will not disrupt the market the statement said 
the proposal to allow china to launch usmade satellites 
caused a controversy within the reagan administration and congress 
the commerce department reportedly was concerned the exports could 
harm the domestic launch industry and some republican senators 
alleged chinas launch prices were artificially low 
but administration sources said the state department favored the 
exports so as not to offend beijing 
two organizations both foreign have applied for licenses to 
export usmade satellites to china

officials today said a former 
us resident convicted by a soviet court of murdering civilians 
during world war ii could be extradited to the soviet union if it 
waives the death penalty 
the question whether to extradite boleslav maikovskis 84 comes 
as chancellor helmut kohl prepares to travel to moscow next week 
for talks with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the soviet union in 1965 sentenced maikovskis to death in 
absentia for his role in burning down a village and killing 
civilians as a pronazi police commander in his native country of 
latvia 
west germany has no death penalty and would probably not agree 
to extradite maikovskis to a country where the death sentence 
awaits him said dortmund prosecutor klaus schacht 
but an extradition could theoretically be possible if for 
example the soviet union agreed to withhold the death penalty in 
this case schacht said in a telephone interview 
maikovskis is being held in a west german prison while 
authorities investigate the shooting deaths of at least 130 men 
women and children in the latvian village of audrine during world 
war ii 
maikovskis could well face a criminal trial here schacht 
said but he said he could not estimate how long investigations 
would take 
schacht works out of dortmunds war crimes prosecution office 
which is responsible for the muenster district where maikovskis was 
taken into custody this week 
the soviet union is reserving the right to officially request 
maikovskis extradition soviet embassy spokesman viktor gutyev 
said in an interview broadcast thurday by the mainzbased zdf 
television network 
west german authorities arrested maikovskis at his muenster 
residence late wednesday and said he probably was living in the 
country at least since november 1987 when he officially applied to 
the west german government for political asylum 
the west german federal office responsible for granting asylum 
is expected to decide on maikovskis request by the end of 
november authorities said 
before that maikovskis was a resident of mineola ny where 
he lived since 1951 he fled the united states at an undetermined 
date while facing deportation the united states began deportation 
proceedings against him in 1976 but the proceedings were held up 
by several appeals 
the supreme court denied his last appeal in 1986

president reagan said today that 
americans should elect george bush because he has shown how to 
keep a cool head in hot crises 
reagan said that during his eight years in office i have 
given him bush some of the most sensitive and difficult tasks 
that weve had and hes never let me or the country down 
reagan whose remarks came in a speech prepared for delivery to a 
rally at western kentucky university did not specify what 
situations had allowed him to observe bushs behavior in crisis 
situations 
reagan without mentioning the name of democratic candidate 
michael dukakis said the massachusetts governor may have been 
surprised at george bushs strength but you know i wasnt 
ive worked more closely with george bush these two terms than 
with any other member of the administration reagan said i 
have seen him keep a cool head in hot crises i have seen his 
leadership and vision 
bush won a turf battle with thensecretary of state alexander m 
haig jr early in the administration to head a crisis management 
team that reagan established but it has never been clear what bush 
did there 
he was subsequently named to head a counterterrorism task force 
and to direct a drug interdiction task force focusing on the 
southern and southwestern borders of the united states 
but bush has been criticized by political opponents for his 
apparently laidback role in meetings he attended in connection 
with the clandestine sales of us arms to iran in 1985 and 1986 
congressional testimony and a presidential review commission said 
that participants in these meetings could not recall anything bush 
said about the initiative at a time when thendefense secretary 
caspar w weinberger and secretary of state george p shultz 
vehemently objected to the move 
earlier in raleigh nc reagan said bush should be elected 
because hes tough on criminals and will keep the strategic defense 
initiative alive 
in a speech prepared for delivery to 4500 gop partisans reagan 
asserted for the first time that his administration has been 
wildly successful in keeping the spacebased antinuclear 
shield on track 
the president said bushs opponent would strive to end the 
controversial program sdi is no fantasy reagan said its a 
reality and its going to shape the future as long as theres a 
republican in the white house 
repeatedly stating that he and bush had forged his 
administrations eightyear programs together reagan said 
theres something that im particularly proud about and 
thats pushing ahead on our efforts to protect the united states 
and the world from the treat of a nuclear attack by means of a 
program we call sdi 
reagan noting that the north carolina area is the home of much 
of the sdi research claimed that his administration has been so 
successful so wildly successful in our research and advances that 
weve slashed an incredible 46 billion thats almost half off 
the projected cost of our most promising program 
reagan in claiming credit for keeping costs down on the 
billiondollar project made no mention of the fact that much of 
the cutting in sdi budgets and pentagon expenses has been forced by 
congress 
the president hit hard on dukakis record on crime asserting 
that he opposes the death penalty absolutely and in every case 
sometimes they seem to care more about the rights of 
criminals than the rights of victims and if you ask me we dont 
need to see the job of the police made any tougher by the kind of 
furlowing of firstdegree murderers even those ineligible for 
parole that weve seen in the state of massachusetts 
reagan said that the nation must choose a responsible 
president who will deal with a responsible congress that seeks to 
enhance our strength at home and abroad 
it is a future of peace through strength and prosperity 
through liberty personified by the man i believe will be the next 
president of the united states george bush 
the primary purpose of reagans appearance is firing up the 
troops said steve schwartz state director for bushs campaign 
people tend to think they have it in the bag when they read 
all these favorable polls i think we have a good double digit 
lead in the state but that doesnt mean anything weve not strayed 
one iota from our original plan which includes a massive 
getoutthe vote drive schwartz said 
a charlotte observer telephone survey of 870 registered voters 
taken oct 9 through oct 12 showed bush leading democratic rival 
michael dukakis 53 percent to 40 percent in the state the margin 
of error was 33 percent 
later in the day reagan was to fly to southern kentucky and 
speak to 12000 students and citizens at western kentucky 
university in bowling green 
the event was billed as a rally for bush and his running mate 
dan quayle 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters thursday 
that reagan was traveling to kentucky because we think weve got 
a good shot of winning there

a man with 33 drunken driving convictions 
and free on bond pending appeal of four others has been released on 
bond after being arrested once again for drunken driving officials 
say 
i have never never ever had anybody with a record even 
approaching that said attorney earle r purser who represented 
otis donald wadford at a hearing in september 
wadford 52 was arrested monday and released after he posted 
1000 bond in wake county district court he was free on a 
previous bond pending his appeal of four drunken driving 
convictions last month the news and observer of raleigh reported 
bond can be denied only in firstdegree murder cases in which 
the death penalty is being sought 
maybe its time we look at the law and consider some sort of 
revision to protect the public said wake district attorney c 
colon willoughby jr maybe public safety outweighs the 
individuals right to be free pending his case being litigated in 
instances other than murder cases 
wadford pleaded guilty sept 8 to four charges each of driving 
while impaired and driving while his license was permanently 
revoked plus assorted other traffic charges he was sentenced to 
four years in prison under a plea agreement negotiated by purser 
but the next day wadford appealed the charges to which he had 
pleaded guilty that made him eligible for release on bond pending 
a new trial 
he was released before either purser or the prosecutor zesely 
haislip jr knew he had appealed purser says he wont represent 
wadford again 
prosecutors generally are not notified immediately of a 
defendants appeal on misdemeanor convictions haislip said he 
said that if he had known he would have asked that bond be raised 
on monday wadford was charged again 
magistrate sonny garner set wadfords bond at 1000 wadford 
posted bond and was again released 
garner said he was aware of only one or two drunken driving 
convictions on wadfords record when he set the bond because the 
magistrates office did not have access to computerized criminal 
histories after 5 pm 
garner said that based on his information the bond was 
appropriate wadford has a trial date of nov 22 on the latest 
charges 
the man just keeps on driving he just keeps on driving 
purser said

human rights activist andrei d sakharov today 
said the kremlin has tentatively agreed to let him leave the soviet 
union for the first time to attend a conference in the united 
states 
he said he will leave for the united states next month 
sakharov the father of the soviet dissident movement told a 
news conference the lifting of a travel ban against him was due to 
mikhail s gorbachevs program of economic and political 
restructuring and the personal efforts of some soviet officials 
granting sakharov a visa to travel abroad would be a dramatic 
gesture to show the liberalization under gorbachevs reforms it 
could also set an uncormfortable precedent for the kremlin because 
many other soviets are prohibited from leaving the country on 
grounds they know state secrets 
sakharov a physicist had been denied permission to travel on 
grounds he had access to sensitive information while working on the 
soviet hydrogen bomb 
he has spoken out repeatedly for free emigration and protested 
soviet intervention in afghanistan for his human rights 
activities he was awarded the 1975 nobel peace prize 
he was exiled to the closed city of gorky in 1980 and released 
under gorbachevs administration in december 1986 
he told reporters the government agreed in principle to 
allow him to attend a conference of the international foundation 
for the survival and development of humanity sakharov said he had 
not yet officially applied for the necessary travel documents 
this question was raised by the authorities of the foundation 
and presented to decisionmakers and now it has received a 
positive response the question is solved in principle i will take 
part in the coming trip by the foundation said sakharov 
the clearest indication sakharov would be given foreign travel 
documents was a decree issued oct 5 by the council of ministers 
the decree directed the foreign ministry to provide members of 
the board of directors and other official representatives of the 
foundation and their family members multiple entrance and exit 
visas for terms of up to two years 
sakharov is a member of the board of the foundation as are 
prominent soviet scientists such as yevgeny velikhov and roald 
sagdeyev 
sakharov has been invited to attend the board meeting in 
washington on nov 15 and 16 as well as meetings in the los angeles 
area san francisco boston new york and possibly chicago said 
group member edward b hodgman 
the moscowbased group is a nonprofit philanthropic 
organization set up in january to help solve environmental human 
rights disarmament and economic development problems 
todays news conference was held in an auditorium at the 
headquarters of the government press agency novosti it was the 
second time the government furnished a stage for the 67yearold 
activist to speak to reporters 
yevgeny velikhov a vice president of the prestigious soviet 
academy of sciences shook sakharovs hand and smiled as sakharov 
arrived sakharov said velikhov had personally interceded to get 
him permission to travel abroad 
in another sign of his return to good graces of soviet 
officials sakharov was elected one of 47 members to the ruling 
presidium of the prestigious academy during the now disgraced rule 
of president leonid brezhnev some members of the academy tried to 
expell sakharov 
sakharov said the academy voted 15282 thursday to elect him a 
member of the academy in charge of cosmology the study of the 
universes origin

families of 27 people killed in a 
church bus crash have agreed to cooperate with a planned movie or 
miniseries about the may 14 accident to ensure its done 
correctly 
we want something realistic not something hollywood style 
bill nichols a spokesman for the families said thursday 
nichols whose son died in the wreck said he and the others 
realized somebodys going to make a movie of it and we wanted to 
have some input 
nichols said the families main concern was we dont want to 
portray larry mahoney as a hero as he is being done now by his 
hometown folks 
mahoney 35 is charged with driving his pickup the wrong way on 
interstate 71 near carrollton when it collided with the radcliff 
church bus carrying 63 youths and four adults twentyseven people 
died during the fire that erupted soon after impact and many 
others were severely burned and injured 
mahoney returned oct 10 to his parents home in owen county 
after relatives and friends provided 540000 in cash and property 
to secure his bond 
he is scheduled to go on trial jan 9 in carroll circuit court 
and is charged with 27 counts of murder 13 counts of firstdegree 
assault 44 counts of wanton endangerment and one count of driving 
under the influence 
a representative of krantz productions inc of studio city 
calif is expected to meet with the family representatives next 
month 
nichols said the families and krantz productions are interested 
in emphasizing the danger of driving under the influence of 
alcohol he also said the person he talked with indicated krantz 
was interested in making a documentary of the crash 
krantz spokesman brian lapan said tuesday that since krantz 
works mostly with the networks a movie about the bus crash 
probably would be less like a documentary and more a disaster drama 
but he added were still in the development stage of it 
jim morgan youth minister at the radcliff assembly of god 
church that owned the bus said we the people that lost children 
or had people on the bus need a say so we dont have fiction in the 
actual movie we want fact not fiction

before her death in 1967 dorothy parker the 
jazz age writer and critic famous for her caustic wit suggested 
her own epitaph excuse my dust 
her ashes have finally been laid to rest in a garden behind the 
naacps national headquarters 
until thursdays ceremony her remains had languished for a 
decade on a shelf in the new york office of lawyer paul odwyer 
who acquired them as attorney for the late writer lillian hellman 
who was executor of mrs parkers estate 
odwyer decided last summer hed like to find a more appropriate 
resting place and the national association for the advancement of 
colored people came up with the final proposal 
mrs parker who was jewish had left her entire estate to civil 
rights leader martin luther king jr and in the event of his 
death to the naacp 
at thursdays ceremony naacp executive director benjamin hooks 
described mrs parker as a battler for civil rights at a time when 
it was socially unacceptable 
the decision to build a memorial garden for mrs parker was a 
symbol of the naacps dedication to strengthening ties between 
blacks and jews he said 
we know the alliance has been subjected to strains and we 
get on each others nerves at times but there are more points on 
which we do agree than we disagree hooks said 
in addition to her vitriolic drama criticisms for vanity fair 
mrs parker won praise for her short stories and for the screenplay 
to the hollywood film a star is born written with her husband 
alan campbell 
her death at the age of 73 ended a life that included several 
unhappy love affairs three marriages and four suicide attempts 
but hooks said mrs parker should be remembered by the lines she 
wrote in her poem epitaph for a darling lady 
leave for her a young red rose 
go your way and save your pity 
she is happy for she knows 
that her dust is very pretty

prime minister yitzhak shamir today accused 
jordans king hussein of meddling in israels election campaign by 
appearing on american television to back the peace plan of foreign 
minister shimon peres 
the results of the israeli elections will be determined by the 
israeli people not by foreign interference said shamir leader 
of the rightwing likud bloc he is running against peres of the 
leftleaning labor party in the nov 1 election 
hussein spoke thursday night in an interview on abctvs 
nightline program alon liel foreign ministry spokesman said 
today the appearance was engineered by peres to show israeli voters 
his peace plan still has a partner 
peres peace plan calls for convening an international middle 
east peace conference that would launch direct talks among the 
parties to the conflict palestinians would be represented by a 
joint jordanianpalestinian delegation 
the proposal initially accepted by hussein suffered a severe 
setback when the monarch announced july 31 he was severing ties 
with the occupied west bank thus removing himself from the peace 
process 
in the first segment of the nightline program peres 
reiterated his proposed plan hussein asked by anchorman ted 
koppel to respond called peres proposal interesting and a 
step forward 
jordan is prepared if the palestinians seek it and ask us 
categorically to go to an international conference in a joint 
palestinianjordanian delegation hussein said 
the monarch also said a shamir victory would be an absolute 
disaster and escalate tensions in the middle east 
shamir refuses to trade territory for peace and proposes to 
negotiate limited palestinian autonomy in direct talks a plan 
rejected by hussein 
liel confirmed koppels ontheair statement that husseins 
appearance was engineered by peres staffers who told nightline 
producers that peres wanted to spell out his peace plan and that 
hussein would respond favorably 
it was an important move to explain to the israeli public that 
the international peace conference and the territoryforpeace 
formula are realistic ideas liel told foreign reporters after 
screening the nightline program for them 
liel acknowledged the move could cause a backlash among voters 
who might resent attempts by foreign leaders to manipulate them 
peres definitely took into consideration that such a move would 
be controversial liel said but he wanted to show that his 
program still has a partner 
but shamir suggested the ploy would harm peres chances in the 
elections those responsible for this attempt will bear full 
public responsibility for their actions shamir said in a 
statement 
likud and peres are running neckandneck according to the 
latest polls 
liel said that while husseins remarks did not contain 
substantive changes he made a shift in emphasis in july 
hussein said if things change i might come back into the 
picture now he says if the palestinians would like i will come 
back liel said

democratic vice presidential nominee 
lloyd bentsen told nursing students today that the democratic 
ticket stands for programs needed by working women including pay 
equity day care an increased minimum wage and the equal rights 
amendment 
were with you were the party of progress for the working 
women of america said bentsen who is michael dukakis running 
mate 
the texas senator who is chairman of the senate finance 
committee said the republicans had tried to cut back on prenatal 
care and health care for children and he ridiculed gop objections 
to federal standards for day care 
we have stronger federal standards on dog food than we have on 
day care protection for our children he said 
he said the reagan administration has opposed an increase in the 
minimum wage and george bush has waffled on the issue while seven 
out of eight jobs filled by women since 1980 have been paying at 
the poverty level 
we wont rest until american women have equal access to 
opportunity and a fair share of the american dream he said 
getting loud applause from the mostlyfemale audience at the san 
antonio health science center 
bentsens press secretary mike mccurry said the speech today 
was aimed particularly at women in texas the campaign has found 
that much of the deterioration in the tickets standing in the 
state where it now trails in the polls has been with young 
working women he said 
bentsen arrived back in his home state of texas on thursday and 
immediately went to corpus christi state university for a 
questionandanswer session via satellite with college students 
in 11 states 
continuing to emphasize the democrats announced commitment to 
education he then flew to san antonio for a visit with middle 
school students including a computer demonstration from a 
13yearold boy 
the television conference from corpus christi featured prominent 
democrats including jesse jackson sen albert gore jr dtenn 
former kentucky gov martha layne collins michael kennedy son of 
the late sen robert f kennedy and actor rob lowe 
the questioners were screened carefully by campaign staff 
members who made sure bentsen didnt get any queries that would 
embarrass him during the 60 minutes of satellite time rented by the 
campaign for the event satellite coordinates were publicized to 
get maximum media coverage 
arkansas gov bill clinton played master of ceremonies and 
punctuated many of bentsens remarks by adding jibes of his own at 
the republicans 
bentsens press secretary mccurry said the event cost about 
14000 and some 3000 students took part in the session the 
satellite feed was made available to television stations nationwide 
obviously were delighted with the format mccurry said 
its a great way to campaign in 11 states simultaneously since 
local reporters were invited at each site 
bentsen told the students the republicans have talked vaguely 
of a thousand points of light and a gentler america while 
savaging the electorate with vicious negative campaigning 
it was a continuation of what he says will be a constant 
campaign through the election to correct what he says are gop 
distortions 
bentsen dropped the harsh political tone at the eisenhower 
middle school in san antonio where he visited 7th and 8th grade 
students working on personal computers 
chris payne a 13yearold who said his father works for a major 
computer company produced a largetype welcome note decorated 
with american flags for bentsen the texas senator signed it and 
returned it to him 
bentsen then took some questions from youngsters gathered in the 
school library and he reminded them of the democrats commitment 
to improving education including a new program to help students 
finance college 
presented with an ike pride tshirt by the group bentsen 
recalled how he once tried to get the schools namesake to run as a 
democrat for president

congressional opponents of us arms sales to 
moderate arab states dont understand american strategy and are 
jeopardizing hopes for securing peace in the region defense 
secretary frank c carlucci said today 
such arms sales not only improve the security of friendly 
nations such as saudi arabia and jordan but help cement 
relationships that provide the united states diplomatic leverage 
carlucci said 
the sales also do not threaten israel he said adding the 
administrations critics fail to think through the implications for 
the jewish state of being surrounded by arab nations relying on 
nonamerican arms 
some in washington and on capitol hill in particular have 
exhibited a lack of realism indeed a strategic confusion about 
the why and wherefore of usarab defense relationships 
carlucci said addressing the americanarab affairs council in 
huntington wva 
various interest groups and many in congress have sought to 
impede virtually every administration initiative to provide 
reasonable and responsible military assistance to our arab 
partners he continued 
as a result great britain france china the soviet union and 
others are moving into the highlydesirable positions of confidence 
and influence which america has traditionally enjoyed with friends 
such as jordan and saudi arabia we need a new sense of realism in 
washington about the strategic purposes of our policies in the 
middle east 
the text of carluccis remarks was released by the pentagon in 
advance of his appearance 
the defense secretary expressed optimism about peace prospects 
despite the current violence between israelis and palestinians on 
the west bank and the failure of secretary of state george shultzs 
shuttle diplomacy 
carlucci said he found heartening the ceasefire between iran 
and iraq and the russian withdrawl from afghanistan he said he 
also had seen signs that radical revolutionary fervor in the region 
was waning 
people want capable productive government stability and 
economic prosperity for this they need peace carlucci declared 
real progress can only occur at the bargaining table he 
continued with all sides participating in direct negotiations 
i am convinced that most arab states are willing to live in 
peace with israel but are themselves continually threatened by 
radical forces in the region he said that is why i believe 
that moderate arab states must be strong enough to resist 
intimidation and take the bold steps to negotiate peace with 
israel 
congress by blocking the sale of arms to arab nations 
undercuts a key to our ability to broker the peace process 
carlucci continued and to make matters worse israel is not 
threatened by such deals he insisted 
israel must regard nonamerican arms in the hands of its 
neighbors as a higher risk carlucci said

the house passed legislation today directing 
the federal aviation administration to step up its research on 
aircraft safety including fire prevention and the problems faced 
by aging planes 
the measure was approved by the house on a voice vote and sent 
to president reagan for his signature the senate passed the 
legislation on a voice vote on thursday 
the bill gathered momentum after a series of airline accidents 
such as the delta airlines crash at dallasfort worth international 
airport last aug 31 in which 14 people were killed but 93 others 
survived 
aviation safety must be improved and can benefit greatly from 
expanded research said rep robert roe dnj chairman of the 
house science and technology committee 
the bill requires the faa to increase its research on postcrash 
fire prevention the legislation also directs the faa to consider 
writing a rule that would require airlines to make aircraft fuel 
tanks that are less prone to fire 
the structural soundness of aging aircraft would be another 
category of required research the provision was inspired by the 
april 28 incident in which the roof of an aloha airlines boeing 737 
peeled off in flight sweeping a flight attendant to her death and 
injuring 61 of 94 people on board before the plane landed safely 
the bill would also require added research on the role human 
performance plays in aircraft safety among the items the faa would 
have to examine would be the standards the agency uses to determine 
how many air traffic controllers it believes are needed 
overall the bill directs the faa to reserve 15 percent of its 
research budget or about 21 million for longterm research 
in another development concerning airline safety the nations 
airlines were told thursday by the faa to examine the takeoff 
warning horns on two of the most widely used jetliners boeing 727s 
and 737s after faulty alarms were found in 35 of the aircraft

southern laos and a priest identified only as the rev bounliep 
were both freed in august 
their longawaited release means that no catholic priests are 
known to be in detention in laos although one priest in the 
capital vientiane is reported to be under house arrest the college 
said 
there are believed to be about 30000 roman catholics in laos 
organized into three apostolic regions the college said after the 
communist takeover of laos in 1975 all catholic schools were taken 
over by the state the seminary was closed and foreign missionaries 
were expelled 
the three laotian bishops have not been able to leave the 
country to visit rome although in recent years the vatican 
pronuncio in neighboring thailand has been able to visit 
vientiane the college said

democrat michael dukakis trying to rally 
innercity black voters behind his underdog presidential campaign 
pledged today to wage a war against drugs that should know no 
bounds 
in an appearance at the bethel african methodist episcopal 
church in harlem dukakis said that the streets of america dont 
belong to the drug gangs and the crack gangs they belong to us 
and in the dukakis administration were going to take them back 
several hundred people turned out to hear the democratic 
presidential candidate but there were many empty seats in the 
church 
earlier in the day dukakis attempting to widen the audience 
for his message in the closing days of the campaign appeared on 
two television interview shows 
in harlem he referred to the drugrelated shooting deaths this 
week of two new york police officers 
when a law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty 
we all die a little bit and when drugs are the cause that grief 
must be matched by determination determination to fight 
determination to wage war determination to beat the drug peddlers 
and thugs who are terrorizing our people and poisoning our kids 
our grief is above politics and our determination to win this 
war should know no bounds 
but that isnt going to happen with an administration that has 
fought and lost the war he said 
dukakis has repeatedly attacked republican rival george bush as 
ineffective at the head of the reagan administrations effort to 
reduce the flow of drugs into the united states 
the democrats appearances on two morning interview shows were 
part of an effort in the final days of the campaign to get him 
greater exposure and trigger a presidential campaign comeback 
the american people are not happy with this campaign he 
told abc on cbs a few minutes later he said this campaign has 
been altogether too negative contending ive been subject to 
attacks and distortion 
the democratic nominee was forced to wrestle with a new 
negativecampaign episode of his own and criticized an aides 
remarks about his republican opponent george bush as a very 
serious mistake in judgment the aide donna brazile quit the 
dukakis campaign on thursday and dukakis apologized to bush later 
in the evening 
dukakis pronounced himself cautiosly optimistic about his 
prospects nov 8 and said voters are only now beginning to focus 
in 
in the next 18 days that will give me an opportunity and give 
senator lloyd bentsen an opportunity to take that message of hope 
and opportunity and confidence about the best america to the people 
of this country he told abc 
dukakis said his appearance on good morning america was 
one opportunity to do that he told cbs this morning i 
hope through interviews like this people will have a better sense 
of who i am 
following his morning tv appearances dukakis planned to deliver 
a fiveminute speech this weekend on network television he 
conceded that were behind a little bit but said a large 
percentage of voters really havent made up their minds 
dukakis was asked about the remarks of brazile deputy field 
director of his campaign who resigned thursday after telling 
reporters that bush owes it to the american people to fess up 
about rumors concerning his personal life 
i dont approve of that kind of thing and shes left the 
campaign dukakis told abc i apologized to the vice 
president 
dukakis aides said the massachusetts governor would deliver a 
fiveminute speech on the abc television network at 955 pm edt 
on saturday he taped the speech along with new television 
commercials at a studio in manhattan 
in recent days dukakis has struck back at bush attacks on the 
massachusetts prison furlough program 
he began by denouncing republican campaign material as 
garbage and a pack of lies then escalated his response on 
thursday by comparing the bush campaign to the watergate white 
house under richard m nixon 
above all the truth should matter a lot in a presidential 
campaign because as we learned in watergate it matters a lot in 
the oval office dukakis said during an appearance in new haven 
conn 
truth was the first casualty in the nixon white house and it 
was the first casualty in the bush campaign said the democratic 
nominee 
at new yorks annual al smith charity dinner dukakis shared a 
dais with bush humor was the order of the evening but dukakis 
couldnt resist mixing in a few political digs 
he apologized for the fact his wife was not present 
kitts in a hotel room in dallas tonight he said maybe 
she qualifies as a texan a reference to the fact bushs official 
residence in texas is a houston hotel room 
he also tried a few selfdeprecating remarks aimed at his image 
ive also been told that i lack passion he said and then 
deadpanned but that doesnt affect me one way or the other

thousands of patches to be worn by us 
customs service employees commemorating the agencys 200th 
anniversary were seized by the departments own inspectors as an 
illegal shipment 
the shipment of 5000 patches was seized thursday at a peace 
bridge warehouse in buffalo ny after agents noticed that the 
packages violated federal regulations requiring a label specifying 
the country of origin said robert tobias president of the 
national treasury employees union 
it was then that our members the inspectors saw that the 
packages contained customs patches made outside the us being 
shipped from canada said tobias whose union represents some 
13000 customs service employees 
commissioner william van raab had ordered the patches earlier 
this year and issued directives that they be sewn on every custom 
employees uniform to commemorate the agencys 1989 bicentennial 
tobias said 
we have buyinamerica in all our contracts and this 
contractor inadvertently had some of the patches made in toronto 
rather than buffalo said david hoover a customs service 
spokesman the inspector who found it doing his job just 
happens to be the president of the union local up there 
hoover a customs service spokesman said a contractor not the 
agency imported the items he described the incident as a funny 
little story 
but tobias didnt see it that way 
this is perhaps the most unpatriotic and stupid blunder the 
commissioner has made in his blunderridden tenure as head of the 
agency he said 
george king a union spokesman said customs service workers had 
been told they would have to pay 250 for each patch but that a 
bill of lading with the shipment listed their cost at 59 cents each 
hoover said however that the patches are being provided to 
inspectors without charge as part of their uniform allowance 
the bill of lading king said listed grant emblems limited of 
toronto as the manufacturershipper and voyage emblems of new york 
city as the importer included was an invoice to the customs 
service

northeast lauderdale high schools first 
dance since racial integration two decades ago was a success in 
spite of a large force of chaperones and adult control of what 
music could be played 
i think its about time for a dance its been too long 
15yearold michael cozart said thursday night as many of about 500 
students paired off 
it could have happened years ago but there are old feelings 
and old ideas said principal roger wright 
northeast lauderdales last schoolsponsored dance was a 
homecoming ball in the cafeteria in 1967 officials said 
many public schools in mississippi discontinued schoolsponsored 
functions such as dances and proms with desegregation in 1969 and 
1970 and only in recent years have some schools revived 
sanctioning of such activities 
tracy anderson an 18yearold 11thgrader was one of the more 
popular dance partners tracy who is black danced with both white 
and black partners 
if they want to dance with me ill dance she said i 
think this is great its been 21 years its about time we got 
something together 
northeast lauderdale high school located about 10 miles 
northeast of meridian has 1176 students in grades seven through 
12 about 60 percent of the students are white 
last week the lauderdale county school board voted 30 with 
two members absent to approve thursday nights dance 
school board members set strict rules before approving the 
function including a requirement that music receive prior approval 
from a committee of three adults 
school board members also considered a ban on slow dancing but 
they relented after complaints from students 
the musicreview committee ruled out a number of records 
including those by such acidrock groups as acdc def leppard and 
molly hatchet 
we didnt want songs with objectionable lyrics said 
lauderdale county school superintendent randy hodges 
we eliminated songs with the word sex and those about sex 
said harold white president of the northeast parentteacher 
association 
on watch during the dance were 36 adult chaperones 21 men and 
15 women 
there were no incidents and no alcoholic beverages were in 
evidence inside or outside of the gymnasium a few students smoked 
cigarettes outside 
teachers have said in the past that with desegregation there 
could be problems said shawn hannington 16 an 11thgrader 
but i think we all get along with everyone there are no racial 
problems

vice president george bush stumping through 
this key industrial state today spelled out the steps he would 
take to achieve his longstated goal of a worldwide ban on 
biological and chemical warfare 
bush in an address before 1200 people at the university of 
toledo said he wants to be known as the president who dealt with 
this terrible scourge which has gained new urgency with the 
recent use of chemical weapons in the iraniraq war 
the dukakis campaign has accused bush of being hypocritical on 
the chemical warfare issue since in 1983 and 1986 he cast 
tiebreaking votes in the senate in support of chemical weapons 
bush also put in a pitch for the strategic defense initiative 
saying that while doing all we can to stop or control missile and 
chemical proliferation we must also develop a defense against 
this threat 
in a slap at his democratic rival michael dukakis bush said 
the last thing we or our allies need at a time when ballistic 
missiles are proliferating is someone who regards strategic defense 
as a fraud or a fantasy 
bush was also campaigning in dayton troy and lancaster ohio 
before returning to washington tonight 
bush said just as we are making headway on the nuclear 
problem the proliferation of chemical arms and ballistic missiles 
challenges our security 
recalling a recent picture of a mother trying to protect her 
child against the invisible wind of death i thought we had 
relegated the horrors of chemical warfare to the history books 
bush was referring to photos of a kurdish mother after iraqis used 
chemical weapons in an attack on a kurdish village this summer 
he proposed 
onsite inspection on demand of suspicious facilities or 
plants 
tightening controls on the transfer of chemical technology and 
weapons 
including the soviets and chinese and perhaps others in a 
proposed mandatory missile technology control regime that regime 
set up in 1987 is now voluntary for the us and its allies 
if im elected president if im remembered for anything it 
would be this a complete and total ban on chemical weapons bush 
said 
thursday evening bush shared a dais with his rival at the al 
smith dinner for catholic charities in new york city and the two 
kept to the best tradition of the glittering event and traded 
oneliners for political punches 
looking out at the tuxedoes and evening gowns bush quipped i 
havent seen so many people so well dressed since i went to a 
comeasyouare party in kennebunkport 
he said he had tried out several jokes on his wife barbara 
telling her bar this sounds a little like johnny carson she 
looked at me and said george i know johnny carson johnny carson 
is a friend of mine and george youre no johnny carson 
bush was also stumping today in dayton and lancaster ohio 
earlier thursday in appearances in normally democratic 
territory in the new york city borough of queens and south river 
nj bush pummeled dukakis on crime and national defense 
at an emotionpacked rally before 1500 students and police at 
christ the king high school in queens bush received the 
endorsement of the new york city police benevolent association and 
other police groups and the shield of the late eddie byrne the 
young new york officer killed last february as he guarded the home 
of a witness in a drug case 
his father matthew byrne a retired police lieutenant said 
we believe that he and his administration will stand up for us 
he defended the reagan administration against charges that it has 
not done enough in the war on drugs and attacked new york gov 
mario cuomo and his predecessor hugh carey for repeatedly vetoing 
death penalty bills 
bush with hundreds of blueuniformed officers lined up in the 
bleachers at his back and a paralyzed officer steve mcdonald in a 
wheelchair beside him said to all of my many statements about 
crime this key national endorsement is a great big exclamation 
point and i am proud of it 
when a police officer is murdered the killer should pay with 
his life bush said to the cheering crowd 
weve heard a lot of tough talk about drugs from my opponent 
i challenge him to drop the rhetoric and stand up publicly 
for the drug bill pending in congress which includes the death 
penalty for those who kill during drug crimes dukakis opposes 
capital punishment 
he also exhorted the catholic school students who had taken a 
pledge beforehand to avoid drugs to stand firm against drug abuse 
your middleclass money pays for the bullets in the guns that 
kill the officers that we honor here today and weve got to stop 
it as a nation said bush

shiite moslem kidnappers holding at least 
two american hostages threatened today to punish them in 
retaliation for israels air attacks on palestinian and proiranian 
guerrilla bases in lebanon 
the threat came in typewritten statements in arabic signed by 
the islamic jihad the proiranian faction holding american 
journalist terry anderson and educator thomas sutherland 
israeli warplanes and helicopters attacked guerrilla strongholds 
in lebanon today in retaliation for a bombing that killed seven 
israeli soldiers fifteen people were killed and 35 wounded in the 
air raids police said 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said 
we deplore the loss of life and the needless suffering of 
people on both sides lebanese and israeli alike we remain deeply 
concerned about the tragic pattern of action and reaction in 
lebanon 
one of the two identical statements attributed to islamic jihad 
or islamic holy war went to a western news agency with an instant 
color photograph of anderson 
the same statement without a photograph was delivered to 
beiruts independent annahar newspaper 
the statement paid tribute to the shiite moslem suicide bomber 
who killed seven israeli soldiers in israels selfdesignated 
security zone in south lebanon on wednesday and it denounced 
israels retaliatory air strikes 
committing this stupidity and this attack shall not pass 
without a punishment the criminal america must realize it will not 
get away with what it has done especially in connection with the 
hostages we hold so that will be a lesson to whoever strikes at 
the dignity and glory of our people and mujahedeen holy 
fighters 
anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was kidnapped march 16 1985 sutherland 57 acting dean of 
agriculture at the american university of beirut was abducted june 
9 1985 
in the photo anderson with a bushy beard was looking directly 
into the camera he was wearing a commodore hotel tshirt as he 
wore when he was kidnapped 
the photograph was similar to one released april 10 when 
islamic jihad threatened to harm the hostages if a kuwaiti jetliner 
hijacked to cyprus was stormed to free the passengers 
the israeli jets scored direct hits on ammunition dumps and 
training bases of the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
and yasser arafats palestine liberation organization said a 
police spokesman in lebanon 
on thursday israels leaders vowed to retaliate against 
hezbollah which claimed responsibility for killing the israeli 
soldiers wednesday hezbollah is an umbrella group for shiite 
groups believed holding most of the 14 foreign hostages who 
include nine americans 
the lebanese police official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said 12 israeli fighterbombers were involved in 
simultaneous air strikes near sidon provincial capital of south 
lebanon and in the eastern town of mashgara 
helicopter gunships later joined the attack on mashgara police 
said 
eight people were killed and 15 wounded in the sidon area and 
seven were killed and 20 wounded in mashgara the spokesman said 
he said clouds of black smoke hung over the stricken bases on 
the outskirts of sidon 25 miles south of beirut and mashgara 15 
miles to the east 
the israeli military command said the raids occurred about 10 
am and were aimed at palestinian targets in the sidon area and 
hezbollah command posts in the villages of mashgara and 
alluwayzah 
the village of alluwayzah is about two miles southeast of 
metulla where the car bombing occurred the military statement 
said at least six usmade f16s took part in the raids 
lebanese police said an ammunition depot belonging to hezbollah 
was hit near the palestinian refugee camp of mieh mieh on the 
outskirts of sidon and set off a series of explosions 
a palestinian guerrilla training base was hit in mieh mieh the 
planes also blasted targets in the nearby ein elhilweh refugee 
camp 
shortly after the air attack israeli troops in the hills in 
south lebanon fired on mieh mieh and alluwayzeh with longrange 
howitzers 
un peacekeeping sources said israeli helicopters also attacked 
meidoun four miles south of mashgara 
the lebanese police spokesman said warplanes also hit targets in 
the ein elhilweh refugee camps also outside sidon 
the warplanes drew heavy antiaircraft fire from palestinian and 
hezbollah gunners no hits were reported 
hezbollah an umbrella for shiite moslem militants loyal to 
irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini claimed responsibility for the 
car bombing that also wounded eight israeli soldiers and two 
lebanese women 
israeli officials often have charged that arafats plo 
guerrillas and hezbollah cooperate in the guerrilla warfare against 
israeli troops and allied lebanese militiamen in south lebanon 
the bombing was the deadliest attack against the israelis since 
march 1985 when a similar suicide car bomb killed 12 israelis and 
wounded 14 
israel withdrew from most of south lebanon in june 1985 three 
years after invading the country and established a security zone 
about six to 10 miles deep north of its border to prevent 
guerrilla infiltrations from lebanon 
the air raid was the 16th on lebanon this year by police count 
68 people were killed and 108 wounded in the previous attacks since 
jan 3

reagan cited unnamed legal authorities as saying that 
dukakis appointments to the massachusetts supreme court have been 
fervent proponents of the liberal social agenda committed to 
imposing it through judicial decree 
white house press spokesman ben jarrett asked to identify the 
authorities cited by reagan said the president got the quotation 
from an article written in a recent wall street journal oped piece 
by charles j cooper a former reagan administration assistant 
attorney general who now is in private law practice in washington 
dukakis said friday he has appointed 130 judges in 
massachusetts some of them have been republicans some of them 
have been democrats i dont put them through a political litmus 
test dukakis said on cbs 
during a campaign trip to north carolina and kentucky reagan 
hammered away at a variety of familiar themes including his 
argument that americans must elect more conservative candidates to 
congress 
his trip into the south took reagan off the course of recent 
campaign outings that have been targeted on key battleground states 
in the midwest 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan decided to 
visit north carolina and kentucky because vice president bush is 
looking good in both states we think weve got a good shot at 
winning them 
in a speech to 4500 gop activists at the civic arena in 
raleigh nc reagan noted the influx of hightechnology companies 
to nearby research triangle park proclaiming his planned star wars 
missile defense system wildly successful 
sdi strategic defense initiativeis no fantasy he said 
its a reality and its going to shape the future as long as 
there is a republican in the white house 
reagan also said bush has shown he can keep a cool head in hot 
crises i have given him some of the most sensitive and 
difficult tasks that weve had and hes never let me or the 
country down reagan did not specify what situations had allowed 
him to observe bushs behavior in crisis situations 
in the western kentucky university address reagan did not 
invoke dukakis name but he maintained that the sevenmember state 
supreme court in massachusetts known there as supreme judicial 
court has issued a host of rulings slanted in favor of the 
perpetrators of crime instead of its victims 
they have opposed the death penalty and opposed mandatory 
sentences for drug dealers he said they believe that 
directing teachers to lead classes in the pledge of allegiance is 
unconstitutional and have voted to strike down a ban on child 
pornography 
thomas f maffie president of the 22000member massachusetts 
bar association said he thought reagan overstated the liberal bent 
of the high state court 
in a telephone interview from his boston law office maffie said 
that dukakis had appointed two of the seven judges on that court 
although the governor did elevate edward f hennessey appointed by 
another governor to the chief justice post 
i dont think you can cast it the court as liberal or 
conservative maffie said i think you can cast it as a 
particularly competent and respected court 
the three most liberal members of the us supreme court 
justices thurgood marshall william brennan and harry blackmun 
will all be 80 or over by inauguration day and the question of 
filling vacancies surfaced during bushs oct 13 debate with 
dukakis 
bush said he would not subject judicial prospects to an 
ideological litmus test but said he would people dedicated to 
interpreting the law instead of rewriting it 
dukakis rapped bush for supporting reagans illfated nomination 
of federal appellate judge robert h bork whose nomination was 
defeated in the senate

a special federal advisory committee today 
tentatively reaffirmed its recommendation that fetal tissue from 
induced abortions can be used for medical research 
the 21member panel was careful to avoid linking its 
recommendation with the morality of abortion 
it is of moral relevance that human fetal tissue for research 
has been obtained from induced abortions the draft language 
said however in light of the fact that abortion is legal and 
that the research in question is intended to achieve significant 
medical goals the panel concludes that the use of such tissure is 
acceptable public policy 
the report will not become final until the written version 
worked out over five days of meetings is circulated by mail to all 
the panels members for any minor editing changes 
the vote on the key recommendation was 133 five committee 
members were absent 
the national institutes of health committee hopes to give the 
recommendation final approval by nov 30 
a standing nih advisory committee is scheduled to meet the 
following day to begin another round of deliberations to be 
completed jan 3 
the detailed schedule laid out by nih officials calls for nih 
director james wyngaarden to forward both reports along with his 
own recommendation to superiors at the department of health and 
human services on jan 13 
the elaborate timetable suggests that no final decision on the 
issue will be made during the final weeks of the reagan 
administration 
medical researchers are optimistic that implanting certain brain 
cells from aborted fetuses can lead to effective treatments for a 
number of diseases with diabetes and parkinsons the best 
candidates 
the advisory committee was formed after nih researchers sought 
permission to do such experimental transplants on parkinsons 
patients 
the thorniest matter facing the special committee today in its 
last scheduled facetoface meeting was whether the report will say 
fetal tissue transplant research is morally acceptable or 
simply acceptable 
a number of committee members are philosophically opposed to 
abortion and reluctant to agree to any recommendation on using 
aborted fetal tissue that would imply a sanction of abortion 
daniel robinson chairman of the psychology department at 
georgetown university in washington is among the panelists who 
although opposed to abortion on principle has indicated a 
willingness to back a recommendation that fetal tissue research 
proceed if the final draft is narrowly couched not to imply a 
sanction of abortion 
this is one of the worrisome ethical issues of our age and no 
government agency can proceed without acknowledging that fact 
robinson said thursday 
the chairman of the committee retired federal appeals judge 
arlin m adams of philadelphia said it seems the mainstream 
consensus is were not taking a position on abortion as such 
we must separate the issue of abortion from medical research 
or we will be where we started when the panel convened initially 
last month adams added 
father james t burtchaell a professor of theology at the 
university of notre dame and a committee member was particularly 
displeased with news accounts that said the panels straw vote last 
month to recommend going forward with fetal tissue research 
amounted to finding it was morally acceptable 
however burtchaell did not dispute that a majority of the 
committee clearly was inclined to recommend federal backing for 
such research once it agrees on precise wording 
the national right to life news has conceded that it is a 
foregone conclusion the committee will recommend proceeding with 
the research probably with 17 of the 21 members eventually voting 
in favor of it

an iranianborn professor at the university of 
virginia on friday described as absolutely false an israeli 
newspaper report that claimed he had served as a mediator in secret 
usiranian talks 
rk ramazani a political science professor for 36 years at the 
university in charlottesville va said he was particularly 
disturbed by the report that mentioned the name of his school 
those key paragraphs are absolutely false ramazani said 
referring to a story in the the nation an englishlanguage weekly 
newspaper that began publishing in israel last month 
state department spokesman charles redman has also criticized 
reports that have appeared in the new paper saying the publication 
prints a steady diet of baloney 
in an unattributed report published oct 7 the paper claimed 
the us government agreed to pay 7 million in ransom to 
proiranian lebanese shiite moslem extremists holding american 
hostages in lebanon 
both secretary of state george shultz and iranian foreign 
minister akbar velayati have categorically denied that the two 
countries have opened talks on the hostages or other subjects 
ramazani in a telephone interview said that an oct 12 story 
in the israeli newspaper claimed that the professor visited tehran 
in the weeks before iraq and iran accepted a ceasefire in august 
to end their eightyear old war 
the paper quoting unidentified sources said ramazani played an 
important role in convincing the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
irans leader to accept a ceasefire 
the story entitled khomeini backs hostage contacts mediated 
by iranborn professor dealt broadly with alleged usiranian 
talks on hostages and other matters 
ramazani a naturalized american who has taught at the 
university of virginia for 36 years said he has not visited tehran 
since 1975 and has not had any contacts with us or iranian 
officials at all recently ramazani is on leave from teaching 
this year to write a book 
from time to time over the past decade ramazani said he has 
consulted with state department officials soliciting his views on 
irans foreign policy his speciality 
he said his last visit to the department came in 1987 when he 
and other academics were invited to have lunch with assistant 
secretary of state richard murphy 
hesh kestin the publisher of the israeli newspaper could not 
be reached for comment the papers telephone number is not listed 
in tel aviv or jerusalem an operator said

ferdinand and imelda marcos said they were simple folks but 
they lived in an ornate citadel of selfglorification from which 
they ruled the philippines with a curious mixture of dictatorship 
and flexibility reform and stagnation 
for most of his 20 years as president filipinos adored the 
brilliant lawyer and shrewd politician who by his own disputed 
account was a great war hero 
the end came in february 1986 when the military helped a 
people power uprising that put president corazon aquino in 
power and forced the marcoses to flee 
in the presidential palace they left behind luxuries ranging 
from exquisite to garish flattering paintings that included one 
called ferdinand the brave and imeldas shoes in their fabled 
thousands 
she had a bulletproof boudoir with gold bathroom fixtures and 
many religious artifacts some of ivory others embedded with 
precious stones a nun who saw the voluptuous realm soon after 
imelda left it said she threw up 
marcos now 71 is accused of looting billions of dollars in 
public funds and stashing it abroad 
about those shoes mrs marcos said 
i was governor of metro manila an area of 1000 shoemakers 
they make millions of pairs of shoes when i was seen in our 
native products i promoted them if each maker over 20 years set 
three new models to show off it would be 3000 pairs of shoes i 
would need that many shoes like a hole in my head but id wear 
each to please them 
the marcoses live as exiles in hawaii and the aquino government 
has turned their former palace suite into a sort of museum of 
greed where one employees duty is keeping all the shoes shined 
filipinos still rally in his support but their numbers dwindle 
marcos said after more than two years in exile that he recognized 
mrs aquino as president and would not try to overthrow her but 
she has refused to allow him back even for the funeral of his 
mother who died last may 
during his tenure marcos kept his pacific archipelago 
proamerican and in return enjoyed the support of five american 
presidents 
he built nearly 65000 miles of roads and more than 3300 
schools and made progress in rural electrification but his 
country remained poor he also dismissed congress rewrote the 
constitution imposed martial law for eight years jailed tens of 
thousands of opponents and was accused of widespread human rights 
abuses 
marcos rode to power in 1965 on the promise of social reform he 
initially was hailed as the standard bearer of a new class of asian 
leaders who did not come from the elite of the colonial era but 
his 20 years in power were marked by unprecedented graft and 
corruption 
he entered politics after world war ii during which he says he 
was a hero us records show most of his medals were awarded after 
the war when he was a powerful politician 
in 1954 he married imelda romualdez a 26yearold beauty queen 
from a poor branch of a prominent family in the central philippines 
family she bore him three children imelda in 1955 ferdinand jr 
in 1958 and irene in 1960 
some critics blamed marcos ultimate downfall on his wifes 
flamboyance and exercise of power 
she told interviews after they arrived in hawaii all those 
ive been good to and ive helped over the years have disappeared 
and im not being cynical when i say youd be surprised how few 
friends you end up with 
hawaiian filipinos she said made life bearable the small 
little ones in the filipino community who gave us solace comfort 
support love everything even food 
these were the kind of little people who came to the palace 
we gave them courtesy said hello had our pictures taken she

a former us resident convicted 
by a soviet court of world war ii atrocities could be extradited to 
the soviet union if it waives the death penalty a west german 
official said friday 
a soviet embassy spokesman told a west german television network 
that the kremlin may request the extradition of boleslav maikovskis 
from west germany 
the question of whether to extradite maikovskis 84 comes as 
chancellor helmut kohl prepares to travel to moscow next week for 
talks with president mikhail s gorbachev 
the soviet union in 1965 sentenced maikovskis to death in 
absentia for his role in burning down a village and killing 
civilians as a pronazi police commander in his native country of 
latvia 
west germany has no death penalty and would probably not agree 
to extradite maikovskis to a country where the death sentence 
awaits him a justice official said friday 
but an extradition could theoretically be possible if for 
example the soviet union agreed to withhold the death penalty in 
this case said dortmund prosecutor klaus schacht in a telephone 
interview 
maikovskis is being held in a west german prison while 
authorities investigate the shooting deaths of at least 130 men 
women and children in the latvian village of audrine during world 
war ii 
maikovskis could well face a criminal trial here schacht 
said but he said he could not estimate how long investigations 
would take 
schacht works out of dortmunds war crimes prosecution office 
which is responsible for the muenster district where maikovskis was 
taken into custody wednesday 
the mainzbased zdf television network broadcast an interview 
thursday in which a soviet embassy spokesman said the kremlin may 
request maikovskis extradition 
the soviet union is reserving the right to officially request 
maikovskis extradition soviet embassy spokesman viktor gutyev 
said in the television interview we take this problem very 
seriously 
both the justice ministry and the foreign ministry are 
responsible for extradition requests a justice ministry official 
said friday 
the soviet union has not requested maikovskis extradition 
justice ministry spokesman juergen schmid said declining further 
comment 
west german authorities arrested maikovskis at his muenster 
residence late wednesday he probably had been living in the 
country at least since november 1987 when he applied to the west 
german government for political asylum 
the west german federal office responsible for granting asylum 
is expected to decide on maikovskis request by the end of 
november authorities said 
before 1987 maikovskis was a resident of mineola ny where 
he lived since 1951 he fled the united states at an undetermined 
date while facing deportation us deportation proceedings began 
in 1976 but the proceedings were held up by several appeals 
the supreme court denied his last appeal in 1986

a sharp increase in lines of credit extended 
by us allies to the soviet union will not harm western security 
as long as any resulting loans are made at market rates and do not 
enhance soviet military capability the state department said 
friday 
the united states does not oppose commercial lending at market 
rates aimed at supporting an expansion of nonstrategic trade with 
the soviet union department spokesman charles redman said 
the us does strongly oppose the notion of subsidized loans 
to the soviet union he added 
redman said that if and when the new lines of credit are drawn 
on during the next several years we would expect that whatever 
lending actually transpires will be consistent with the allied 
consensus against subsidizing loans to the soviet union 
a new york times account in fridays editions said commercial 
banks in west germany france britain italy and japan have 
signaled their intention to lend more than 9 billion to moscows 
bank for foreign economic affairs 
it said total new lending to the soviet union during the 
threeyear period from 198587 was 8 billion 
but redman pointed out that the recent transactions involve 
multiyear lines of credit not actual loans 
its by no means clear at this point that such lines of credit 
would lead to a real increase in soviet borrowing over the next few 
years though it is possible they might he said 
redman said the allied consensus on the issue was expressed most 
recently at the may economic summit 
it was agreed that eastwest economic relations can be expanded 
so long as the commercial basis is sound they are conducted 
within the basic principles and rules of the international trade 
and payments system and are consistent with security interests of 
each of our countries 
redman said the allies have agreed specifically to lend only at 
market rates to the soviet union 
the times account said the lines of credit to the kremlin have 
caused deep divisions within the administration and the congress 
with the pentagon countering state departments arguments by 
contending that western loans enable the soviets to maintain global 
commitments

it might be just another loch ness 
nessie or lake tahoe tessie water beasts that catch the 
imagination but somehow are never trapped themselves 
but at least a couple of people near wadsworth have reported 
seeing an alligator in the truckee river and state game wardens 
are taking the claim seriously enough to set baited traps for the 
reptile 
so far however the gator described as 34 feet long and 3 or 
4 years old has given authorities the slip 
jim curran the states regional fisheries supervisor said the 
reported alligator is too small to pose a threat and might not 
survive the nearfreezing winter waters anyway the reptiles 
normally live in tropical rivers and marshes 
we figure this one must have been someones pet curran 
said when it got too big they dumped it in the river 
the first reported sighting came oct 14 when jack maughan said 
he spotted the snubnosed reptile in the river while taking his 
daily walk along the bank and maughans son bryan says he saw 
the animal sunday 
the story of the wadsworth gator sightings isnt being ignored 
by the town located about 10 miles east of the renosparks area 
tom peterson the local fire chief and owner of the wadsworth 
inn has made tshirts boasting the town is the states gator 
capital and this weekend the fire department volunteers are 
hosting an indian taco feed featuring superhot gator sauce 
meanwhile the story continues to grow 
yeah its 3 to 4 long but at 11 oclock after a few beers 
that gator gets to be a 16footer claims peterson

veteran liars here saw a familiar fib 
when they read a story this week about a liars club in nebraska 
a lie judged good enough to get the alleged author inducted into 
a liars hall of fame in nebraska in 1987 bears a striking 
resemblance to a lie that won a missouri man the title of world 
champion liar in the burlington liars club 1979 contest 
robert peterson sr of dannebrog neb claims one day in 
february it was so cold that he saw a lawyer with his hands in his 
own pockets 
that tale got peterson inducted into the national liars hall of 
fame in dannebrog 
but in 1979 ca laurie of eckland mo was named world 
champion liar by the burlington liars club for saying it was so 
cold in missouri one winter that he saw a politician standing on 
the street corner with his hands in his own pockets 
the lie we named a champion years ago was told with a 
politician not a lawyer said don reed vice president and 
20year member of the burlington liars club 
but reed said he doesnt mind 
i feel there should be nothing to stop anybody from telling a 
tall tale he said were dedicated to the perpetuation of the 
american heritage of telling tall tales 
but well always be the granddaddy of them all he added 
the burlington liars club was founded in 1929 and chooses its 
winner each new years eve entries come from all over the country 
and world last year more than 200 lies were sent to the 
burlington club 
at least thats what they say

republican dan quayle on friday said 
the democrats will not stage a harry trumanstyle comeback this 
year copying a line used against him to devastating effect in the 
vice presidential debate 
i dont know michael dukakis i never served with michael 
dukakis michael dukakis is not a good friend of mine the gop 
vice presidential nominee said but i know this michael dukakis 
is no harry truman 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen had used a 
similar cadence to declare quayle no jack kennedy in the prime 
sound bite of the vice presidential debate 
aides said it was the first time quayle had made reference to 
the putdown during a campaign speech 
quayle opened his campaign day at a noisy college rally where 
backers and critics shouted for attention interrupting his speech 
at least four times with chants 
theyve always been negative and they always will be quayle 
declared they are the party of failure we are the party of 
success 
at one point when chanters interrupted his speech quayle paused 
and asked is that sam donaldson in the room donaldson is an 
abc news correspondent with a reputation for shouting questions 
they can go ahead and yell quayle said were going to 
talk about issues and ideas 
quayles stump speeches are routinely greeted by protesters but 
fridays event was the first of the week where more than a handful 
were on hand 
quayle launched his campaign day in a steady drizzle in eastern 
tennessee donning a white laboratory coat to tour a hospital 
research facility and then speak to thousands of cheering college 
students at east tennesee state university 
he scheduled campaign stops in tennessee and georgia to hammer 
dukakis as being weak on defense issues a strong selling point in 
the generally conservative south 
also on friday quayle was asked about massachusetts sen edward 
kennedys comments that quayle had been unfairly portrayed by the 
media 
quayle said he has strong ideological differences with 
kennedy but youd be surprised at how many things we agree on

genetic fingerprints can be used 
as evidence in florida criminal trials a state appeals court has 
ruled in a rape case that prosecutors said was the nations first 
successful use of dna tests 
in a 15page decision issued thursday the florida 5th district 
court of appeal found that dna tests were properly admitted in the 
rape trial of a man convicted in november 1987 and sentenced to 22 
years 
dna or deoxyribonucleic acid is the substance that makes up 
chromosomes and carries the genetic code that determine an 
individuals personal characteristics such as eye color hair 
texture and blood type 
assistant state attorney tim berry noted during courtoom 
arguments over the tests that they have proven effective for 10 
years in paternity cases 
the issue of dna tests as evidence was a central element in the 
case against tommie lee andrews of orlando who was charged with 
raping and slashing a woman in her home on feb 21 1987 
the victim could not identify her attacker but police found 
andrews fingerprints on the frame of a broken window screen at the 
scene also admitted as evidence were dna tests comparing the 
rapists semen with andrews blood 
experts testified the tests showed a perfect match and said the 
chance the semen sample would identically match another persons 
dna code was about one in 840 million 
assistant public defender kenneth witts of daytona beach 
appealed arguing that dna identification testing was only 10 years 
old and scientifically unreliable 
but assistant attorney general kellie nielan of daytona beach 
countered by saying that dna identification testing was widely 
accepted as reliable within the scientific community and has been 
successfully used in criminal cases in the united kingdom 
i know several states are putting together legislation in this 
area she said it is nationally being recognized as a fairly 
useful tool for law enforcement purposes 
the appeals court agreed 
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling the 
test results admissible in this case the opinion said in 
contrast to evidence derived from hypnosis truth serum and 
polygraph evidence derived from dna print identification appears 
based on proven scientific principles 
indeed there was testimony that such evidence has been used 
to exonerate those suspected of criminal activity 
witts said he would probably ask the daytona beach court to send 
the case on to the state supreme court which the appeal court can 
do if it finds the case to have a constitutional question 
andrews was convicted in a separate orlando rape case this past 
february and dna tests were again used against him

embittered antisandinista nicaraguan exiles are 
unlikely to participate in a relief drive aimed at helping their 
homeland after the expected onslaught of hurricane joan community 
leaders said 
while nicaragua and other central american nations braced for 
the storm friday by evacuating their caribbean coastlines miami 
exiles evaluated its potential impact by who gets hurt 
sandinistas contra rebels or refugees 
i havent heard of any relief plans and dont think there will 
be any organized here in miami said roberto arguello founder 
and director of the nicaraguan american bankers association 
he said most of those who live in the area expected to be 
hardest hit have already been relocated what remains are 
sandinista military operations posts on the atlantic coast 
we are certainly not going to help them arguello said 
let the russians bail them out 
however if nicaraguan refugees in honduras were affected or if 
managuas cardinal miguel obando y bravo asked for help a relief 
drive might be organized he said in the latter case leaders said 
they would want guarantees that the aid would not wind up helping 
the sandinistas 
in the past there have been misused resources in nicaragua 
said contra spokesman jorge rosales the most efficient way to 
distribute help would probably be through the church we are all 
nicaraguans but unfortunately the red cross is under the control 
of the sandinista government rosales said 
lets just pray joan doesnt hit he added theres too 
much suffering in nicaragua already 
rosales said those likely to suffer the most are refugees and 
the poor 
the sandinista commandantes are living very nicely in their 
houses around managua he said 
speaking for the nicaraguan brotherhood a leading volunteer 
group for needy nicaraguan exiles martha cardenal said the group 
had its hands full helping refugees in miami 
were an apolitical group we dont care if someone is a 
former sandinista or contra we just try to help them survive 
she said 
in washington sarli porta spokeswoman for the nicaraguan 
embassy said the nation has not yet requested aid but is 
interested in whatever help is offered 
this is a national emergency a case of humanitarian needs of 
all types she said we expect everyone to be involved in 
relief activities in this case were all nicaraguans and thats 
the basis were going to work on

about defense issues its about dragging the truth into the 
gutter and im not going to let them do it

weapons systems his ads say im against 
bush is accused of false advertising in another new dukakis 
ad which says george bush talks a lot about prison furloughs 
but he wont tell you that the massachusetts program was started by 
a republican and stopped by mike dukakis the ad also says the 
bush administration has furloughed 7015 drug dealers one of 
whom raped and murdered a pregnant mother of two

leadership 
mr bush is more interested in photo opportunities than in 
real opportunities to get drugs off our streets he said 
in the last eight years cocaine imports have tripled 
drugrelated deaths have doubled our neighborhoods have been 
destroyed and our apartment houses have become battlegrounds drugs 
are poisoning our children and destorying their lives

fast in massachusetts where he is governor as in the rest of 
the country 
im pround of my record fighting drugs he said weve put 
five times as many drug dealers behind bars

nothings gone away its just on hold

schools first affirmative action officer after a 16month search 
e shelton burden who holds degrees in law and chemistry and is 
currently director of affirmative action programs at auburn 
university in alabama said she plans to start work at the 
2722student womens college in january her hiring came two weeks 
after smith administrators said notes containing racial slurs were 
slipped under a students door and more than a year after students 
demonstrated and several black professors left the college after 
complaining that the administration was dragging its heels on 
affirmative action 
at the university of massachusetts chancellor joseph duffey and 
the man he hired to investigate the problems blamed underlying 
racial tensions for fights in 1986 black mets fans and white 
boston red sox rooters fought when hundreds of students poured out

emperor hirohito received a blood transfusion 
friday after one earlier in the day caused him to break out in a 
rash palace officials said 
kenji maeda a spokesman for the imperial household agency said 
the emperor received about a halfpint of blood 
he said incompatible elements in the blood of the earlier 
transfusion caused the 87yearold emperor to develop the rash 
which disappeared after the transfusion was stopped 
since the emperors internal bleeding began sept 19 doctors 
have given him almost daily blood tranfusions adding up to more 
than 23 pints in the past month 
maeda said the repeated transfusions have been putting a strain 
on the emperors kidneys 
news reports have said the emperor has cancer but palace 
officials have refused to confirm or deny the reports 
an agency source who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
hirohito seemed to be in good spirits and conversed with several 
family members who visited him during the day 
he said the emperor often watches an afternoon drama series on 
television but added that palace officials have kept hirohito from 
watching television news or reading newspapers for fear the reports 
on his health could be disheartening

residents displaced by a vast underground 
coal mine fire are faced with a new fire of undetermined depth and 
size burning in a coal seam in a surface mine 
state and federal officials involved in the centralia mine fire 
project which involved buying out and resettling more than 400 
families believe the newest outbreak recently ignited in a pile of 
illegally dumped debris 
the fire just north of centralia is on land owned by pagnotti 
coal co of luzerne county which planned to move excavating 
equipment in to dig out the burning coal officials said 
we believe well be getting in there early enough to get it 
all out although we dont know how deep it is said jack beadle 
a pagnotti engineer 
the new fire detected monday by a police officer is about a 
mile north of the more extensive underground fire that has been 
burning in old mine tunnels and coal seams since 1962 it is only a 
few hundred yards below a development where five centralia families 
built new homes to get away from the larger mine fire 
local fire crews were called twice this week to douse burning 
refuse in the pit but coal just below the surface continues to 
burn producing two plumes of smoke by day and visible at night as 
dull bluish flames 
right now we just dont know what we have something ignited 
there and coal has ignited it presents a bad situation said 
state geologist gary greenfield 
he said that if the fire is found to be more extensive than 
pagnotti alone is able to control state officials will discuss 
alternatives with federal mining officials 
one of the nearby homeowners is centralia police chief tom 
mcginley who said thursday he would worry only if nothing is done 
soon to put the new fire out 
its definitely caught the coal burning in the bank id be 
concerned if they dont do something about it mcginley said 
estimating the closest home to be about 250 yards away from the 
burning pit 
centralia mayor anne marie devine said the voice of 
experience should alert officials to act quickly in light of what 
has happened in her town 
its very important that something be done before it gets out 
of hand whats so ironic about it is these people who moved up 
there are now closer to an underground fire than they were when 
they lived in centralia she said 
officials said it is important to deal with such a coal fire in 
its early stages before it can expand and burn uncontrollably down 
into the numerous coal veins and abandoned mines crisscrossing 
these anthracite coal fields 
with this type of fire you need to get at it pretty quick 
because it easily gets out of control said david hamilton a 
program specialist with the us office of surface mining

the house sent three bills to president reagan 
on friday aimed at focusing the governments longrange aviation 
research boosting the commercial satellite industry and bringing 
order to federal superconductivity efforts 
on a voice vote the house passed a measure directing the 
federal aviation administration to step up its research on aircraft 
safety including fire prevention and the problems faced by aging 
planes 
the bill requires the faa to increase its research on postcrash 
fire prevention and directs the agency to consider writing a rule 
that would require airlines to make aircraft fuel tanks that are 
less prone to fire 
the structural soundness of aging aircraft would be another 
category of required research the provision was inspired by the 
april 28 accident in which the roof of an aloha airlines boeing 737 
peeled off in flight sweeping a flight attendant to her death and 
injuring 61 of 94 people on board before the plane landed safely 
the bill would also require added research on the role human 
performance plays in aircraft safety among the items the faa would 
have to examine would be the standards the agency uses to determine 
how many air traffic controllers it believes are needed 
overall the bill directs the faa to reserve 15 percent of its 
research budget or about 21 million for longterm research the 
senate passed the measure on thursday 
on a 3551 vote the house approved legislation aimed at helping 
private satellite launchers who have been battered ever since the 
challenger space shuttle disaster of january 1986 
the bill requires commercial launchers of satellites to obtain 
insurance to cover potential losses by private companies and 
individuals up to 500 million the governments liability would be 
limited to 15 billion beyond the insured level 
launchers would also have to obtain up to 100 million in 
insurance to cover possible damage to government property 
to help us companies that had agreements with nasa to launch 
satellites when the challenger explosion occurred the measure 
would exempt those firms from having to obtain insurance against 
damage to federal property 
the sole vote against the measure was cast by rep henry 
gonzalez dtexas who said he was uncomfortable with what he said 
would amount to government subsidies to private companies in the 
bill 
in august 1986 reagan ordered nasa to halt launches of 
commercial and foreign satellites at that time 44 companies had 
agreements with nasa to launch satellites on the shuttle and half 
of them had space vehicles already under construction 
the measure also bars the government from preempting private 
launches as it did after the challenger catastrophe except for 
cases of imperative national need the bill would prevent the 
imposition of extra federal charges on companies if their launch is 
preempted by the government it would also require nasa to report 
to congress within a week on the reasons for the preemption and 
providing a new launch schedule 
the legislation passed the senate on a voice vote on oct 14 
on a 3530 tally the house also approved a measure ordering the 
white house to draft a fiveyear plan for federal research on 
superconductivity 
recent years have seen a dramatic growth in federal and private 
efforts in the field with scientists beginning to produce 
materials allowing the transmission of electricity at levels of 
efficiency that are now unattainable such advances could 
revolutionize energy storage electronics transportation and other 
industries 
critics however have said the governments work has been 
unfocused the bill would give the white house nine months to write 
its research plan 
the senate passed the bill oct 5

a campaign to designate english as arizonas 
official language should be debated on its merits not on the 
political views of its supporters the new head of a national 
proenglish group says 
opponents of arizonas proposition 106 should climb out of the 
gutter of their big lie techniques and character assassination and 
debate the real issues us english chairman stanley diamond 
said at a news conference thursday our opponents know that they 
cannot defeat us on the merits so they are attempting to cloud the 
issue by smearing our organization and motives 
diamond architect of a proenglish campaign in california two 
years ago took over monday as chairman of us english from 
founding chairman john tanton 
tanton resigned after former white house aide and us senate 
candidate linda chavez announced she was quitting as president of 
the group because of questions about some tanton associates and 
because of controversial racial and religious references in a memo 
tanton had written two years ago 
we will not permit dr tanton to become the issue said 
diamond a san francisco businessman 
the arizona measure similar to proposals on the ballot in 
florida and colorado would designate english as the states 
official language and require state and local governments to 
transact business in english exceptions would be allowed in cases 
where public health or safety was threatened and where federal laws 
applied such as bilingual ballots and bilingual education for 
children 
supporters of the measure say it would unify the state and 
encourage minorities to join the mainstream faster opponents say 
it would be divisive and could hurt efforts to attract foreign 
business and tourism as well as harming ethnic minorities 
diamond challenged opponents of the arizona measure to debate it 
on statewide commercial television and offered to put up half the 
money if time is not donated by the stations 
the two sides are already slated to face off on public 
television and a spokesman for the measures opponents said after 
diamonds news conference that his group would gladly engage in 
other debates but could not afford to buy broadcast time 
the arizona opponents have raised 80000 to 100000 to date 
mostly from banks utilities and other corporations 
proposition 106 supporters have raised 160000 97 percent of 
it through a tanton corporation that raised money by direct mail 
and passed it on to us english 
us english and its local supporters have refused to identify 
their contributors but did say thursday that us english had about 
7500 arizona members who contributed 315000 
tantons memo written for a conference on immigration 
mentioned what he said was a potential for conflict if poorly 
educated hispanic and asian catholics enter the united states and 
have more children than affluent englishspeaking citizens 
critics have also claimed that some of tantons associates in 
other organizations have supported forced sterilizations and 
eugenics research 
i disown them diamond said of tantons ideas i disavow 
them and he should have resigned 
ms chavez served as a reagan administration aide and was an 
unsuccessful gop candidate for the senate in maryland two years ago

george bush proposing to still the 
invisible winds of death on friday advocated international 
onsite inspections to enforce a ban on chemical weapons and urged 
sanctions against nations that use them 
bush did not mention his tiebreaking votes in the senate in 
1983 and 1986 in favor of us chemical weapon arsenals 
expanding on an earlier campaign pledge bush also said he would 
seek to persuade the soviet union and china to join industrial 
nations of the west in forging new restrictions on the sale of 
missiles capable of carrying chemical weapons 
the eventual combination of chemical weapons and ballistic 
missiles could put new destructive power in the hands of 
governments with terrorist records bush told an audience of 
about 1200 at the university of toledo 
data released by the campaign said israel and seven other 
countries in the middle east egypt saudi arabia south yemen 
syria libya iran and iraq do not have ballistic missiles 
a campaign fact sheet singled out china north korea argentina 
and brazil as among the countries that continue to supply them 
later at an enthusiastic rally at a municipal ice skating arena 
in troy ohio bush told a capacity crowd of 6000 that the state 
with its 23 electoral votes was absolutely crucial to his 
election he vowed to run never letting up right down to the 
wire bush is scheduled to return to the state next tuesday 
aides insisted the vice presidents advocacy of a tough global 
ban on chemical weapons does not conflict with his tiebreaking 
senate votes in 1983 and 1986 to continue us production of such 
weapons 
after a second such vote in 1983 president reagan called bushs 
mother to explain why the vote was necessary george knows i 
disapprove of it dorothy bush said then 
bush said that barriers against the use of gas and other 
chemical weapons established after world war ii but breached 
during the iraniraq war must be repaired and raised even 
higher 
ive seen a few things in my life but i thought we had 
relegated the horrors of chemical warfare to the history books 
bush said 
i thought we had banished forever what we saw only a few 
months ago a mother trying to protect her child waving her arms 
against the invisible winds of death 
it was a reference to news photographs last summer of a mother 
and child in an iranoccupied kurdish village in iraq 
bush said if elected he would back up his proposal to ban 
chemical weapons with an international agreement to permit onsite 
inspections on demand of chemical plants 
this will be an enormously difficult task but the alternative 
is much worse bush said 
he also called for international sanctions against violators of 
the ban aides said this might range from formal censure in an 
international body like the united nations to unspecified economic 
or diplomatic sanctions 
outside the auditorium where bush spoke at the university of 
toledo about 200 protesters gathered many of them union members 
bearing produkakis signs and chanting bush go home

president reagan is saddened by 
the indictment of former philippine president ferdinand marcos and 
his wife imelda on racketeering charges but he allowed the justice 
department to proceed because no foreign policy considerations 
stood in the way his spokesman said friday 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater speaking with reporters 
during reagans visit to western kentucky university said the 
president realizes now its time for the justice system to take 
its course 
reagan is saddened that it happened because he marcos is an 
old friend and a friend of the country fitzwater said 
the spokesman also stressed however that marcos has been 
indicted over matters that allegedly took place since he arrived in 
the united states in 1986 
these are crimes that allegedly occurred since he marcos got 
here if hed behaved himself he wouldnt be in this 
position fitzwater said 
reagan had hinted thursday that he would not interfere in the 
justice department action when he told reporters it would have 
to be a matter of foreign policy to bring to my desk and not just 
something legal 
according to the indictment marcos transferred 103 million 
into the united states to buy manhattan real estate and also 
defrauded banking institutions of more than 165 million in the 
purchase and financing of those properties 
the indictment charged that between 1972 and 1986 when marcos 
and his wife went into exile in hawaii they accumulated millions 
of dollars through embezzlement theft bribes and kickbacks 
fitzwater said the state department and the national security 
council had advised the president that there were no foreign 
policy considerations that would stand in the way of the justice 
department action 
fitzwater said he did not know the details of why those agencies 
reached that decision 
the president was aware that marcos had been offered a plea 
bargain and that if marcos had accepted the governments offer 
there wouldnt have been an indictment fitzwater said 
he said the white house went along with the plea bargain 
approach but he said it was strictly a justice department plan 
the spokesman added that after marcos attorneys notified the 
justice department on thursday night that he would not accept that 
arrangement on that basis justice went ahead 
asked how reagan felt about the legal action against marcos 
fitzwater said obviously the president knew it had aided in 
his departure from the philippines and feels saddened by the need 
for this 
but its clear that the justice department has a very strong 
case and it will proceed through the system fitzwater said 
the spokesman said he could not comment on whether there had 
been any contact between reagan and marcos because of the legal 
nature of the matter 
asked if any other foreign leader might follow marcos example 
and take refuge in the united states if he comes under pressure in 
his own country fitzwater said we didnt make any offers we 
couldnt keep 
any foreign leader can take our word on anything he said

president augusto pinochet replaced eight 
members of his 16man cabinet friday in a shakeup prompted by the 
voters rejection of a proposed new term 
the presidential press office announced that pinochet the 
72yearold army commander would swear in eight new ministers 
friday night but did not identify them or rule out that cabinet 
members could be shifted into new positions 
the press office also said sergio fernandez would remain as 
interior minister the most politically powerful post despite 
opposition calls for his ouster 
opposition political leaders were calling for his replacement 
with someone more willing to accept their calls for democratic 
reforms before pinochets term ends in march 1990 
pinochet and fernandez have rejected any reforms to the 
countrys 1980 constitution which the opposition maintains must be 
amended to ensure democracy in the future 
all 16 government ministers stepped down thursday to allow 
pinochet to adjust policy after his oct 5 defeat in a referendum 
on extending his rule to 1997 
the new cabinet is pinochets 40th since he seized power in a 
bloody 1973 coup that toppled the elected leftist government of 
president salvador allende and ended a long tradition of democratic 
rule 
according to the announcement other cabinet members confirmed 
in their posts included retired navy adm patricio carvajal of 
defense hernan buchi of finance and army gen manuel concha of 
economy 
it said pinochet also planned to swear in a new 
secretarygeneral of the presidency a cabinetlevel post to 
replace army gen sergio valenzuela 
the replaced cabinet members included foreign minister ricardo 
garcia and orlando poblete the government secretarygeneral 
according to the announcement 
fernandez and poblete oversaw pinochets campaign for the oct 5 
referendum it was rejected by a margin of more than 800000 votes 
or 55 percent to 43 percent with the remaining two percent blank or 
annuled 
an open election is planned for december 1989 to pick a 
successor 
while most legal experts say pinochet cannot legally succeed 
himself he has not ruled out being a candidate 
pinochet was said to be furious with some cabinet members 
including fernandez and poblete accusing them of tricking him 
into believing he would win the referendum 
poblete allegedly altered the results of a governmentcontracted 
polls two days before the ballot to give the impression pinochet 
was leading 
after the vote fernandez argued in a nationally broadcast 
address that the results were actually positive for pinochet that 
the 43 percent tally in his favor showed he was chiles principal 
political leader 
but most rightwing political leaders who backed pinochets 
campaign quickly began distancing themselves from him 
several declared that he had been given his chance and that it 
was now the time for civilian politicians to pursue the presidency

medical screening tests for the aids virus are 
more accurate than two years ago but a panel of experts said 
friday that confirmation of the disease requires at least two 
positive tests before a patient is informed 
the current tests are very very good but they are not 100 
percent said thomas a obrien a du pont co expert on aids 
testing he said there still are medical people using only a single 
test to determine if patients are infected with aids 
in a report issued friday after three days of discussion at the 
national bureau of standards obrien and other experts recommended 
that aids testing should not be considered completed until both 
screening and confirmatory tests are completed 
he said the testing sequence should start with a screening test 
called elisa for enzymelinked immunosorbent assay for those 
with a positive elisa test he added there should then be a 
confirmation test called a western blot 
both laboratory tests are based on the presence in the patients 
bloodstream of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus or 
hiv which causes aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
if you test 10000 people for hiv the current tests would 
give an elisa positive on 2 percent or 20 said obrien out 
of the 10000 the western blot confirming test would be needed 
only on those 20 samples 
obrien said that only about 10 percent of people testing 
positive by the elisa test are actually infected with aids as a 
result he said you dont tell someone that they are hiv 
positive on elisa alone 
some samples obrien said cannot be confirmed as positive or 
negative even with both elisa and western blot he said the expert 
panel recommended that this indeterminate group undergo 
additional and different tests before a final report is made to the 
patient 
aids is a contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune 
system and makes it incapable of defending against infection the 
disease is not now curable and no one has been known to recover 
from it as of monday there have been 75768 aids cases reported 
in the united states and 42653 have died 
aids testing was one of four subjects addressed in a unique 
gathering of medical testing experts at the national bureau of 
standards the gathering included testing specialists from 
government agencies industry and hospitals officials said the 
purpose of the threeday meeting was to draw up recommendations for 
assuring that the nations laboratories are providing accurate 
testing 
the group issued recommended ways to improve testing for aids 
for drug abuse for cholesterol and for the pap smear cancer 
screening test 
among the recommendations were 
though testing for cholesterol was generally found to be 
accurate in hospital laboratories the group recommended that 
cholesterol measurements made in a physicians office laboratory 
should be studied since these labs often are not part of a 
routine quality control program 
a common system of measuring the presence and concentration of 
drugs in urine tests should be established nationally the experts 
said that there now exists a common reference material a sample 
containing pure drugs at known concentrations for marijuana but 
not for other controlled drugs such as cocaine pcp or 
amphetamines the report said that such a common reference material 
would increase the accuracy of drug testing 
the panel also said that the analysis of urine specimens can 
identify an exposure to drugs but it does not measure the level of 
impairment the experts recommended that research be conducted to 
determine how such impairment can be accurately measured 
the experts said that falsenegative findings in pap smears a 
test for the presence of cervical cancer are running as high as 4 
to 8 percent but that these errors often are a result of poor 
technique in collecting specimen the panel recommended that the 
pap specimen collection technique be standardized and that women 
patients receive better instructions in how to prepare for this 
test 
dr beverly b kraemer a laboratory director at st johns 
mercy medical center in st louis mo said though there are 
inaccuracies in pap smear tests the procedure is still a womans 
best friend in the war against cancer and one of the most 
successful lifesaving laboratory procedures now commonly used

prime minister yitzhak shamir on friday accused 
jordans king hussein of meddling in israels election campaign by 
backing the peace plan of foreign minister shimon peres shamirs 
main political rival 
the results of the israeli elections will be determined by the 
israeli people not by foreign interference shamir said the 
elections are nov 1 
hussein spoke thursday night in an interview on abctvs 
nightline program foreign ministry spokesman alon liel said 
friday the appearance was engineered by peres to show his peace 
plan still has a partner 
peres plan calls for convening an international middle east 
peace conference that would launch direct talks between the parties 
to end the conflict over the israelioccupied territories seized 
during the 1967 middle east war palestinians would be represented 
by a joint jordanianpalestinian delegation 
the proposal initially accepted by hussein suffered a setback 
when the monarch announced july 31 he was severing ties with the 
occupied west bank thus removing himself from the peace process 
on nightline peres reiterated his peace plan hussein 
asked to respond called peres proposal interesting and a 
step forward 
jordan is prepared if the palestinians seek it and ask us 
categorically to go to an international conference in a joint 
palestinianjordanian delegation hussein said 
the monarch also said a shamir victory would be an absolute 
disaster and escalate middle east tensions 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc refuses to trade 
territory for peace and proposes negotiations for limited 
palestinian autonomy a plan rejected by hussein 
more than 300 palestinians have died in a 10month uprising 
against israeli rule in the occupied lands home to 15 million 
palestinians six israelis also have died 
the nightline program was an important move to explain to 
the israeli public that the international peace conference and the 
territoryforpeace formula are realistic ideas liel told 
reporters after screening the program for them 
liel acknowledged the move could cause a backlash among voters 
who might resent attempts by foreign leaders to manipulate them 
but peres wanted to show that his program still has a partner 
shamir indicated that the ploy would harm peres chances in the 
elections those responsible for this attempt will bear full 
public responsibility for their actions shamir said in a 
statement 
likud and peres leftofcenter labor party are running 
neckandneck according to the latest polls 
israeli commentators noted that in the nightline interview 
hussein did not deviate from his position announced july 31 that 
he would return to the peace process upon request by the 
palestinians 
however said israel army radio commenator horst frankel 
there is importance in the fact that 10 days before the election 
hussein is willing to come out and help shimon peres in the 
campaign even if this puts him in an unpleasant situation in the 
arab world 
also friday israeli troops shot and wounded 13 palestinians 
during clashes in nablus and the gaza strip refugee camps of shati 
nusseirat and deir al balah hospital officials said 
the wounded included a 12yearold shot in the left arm with a 
plastic bullet and two 17yearolds in serious condition with 
plastic bullet wounds to the chest and neck the officials said

about 800 refugees from southern vietnam have 
refused to move from a delapidated factory to a new camp because 
theyre uneasy about living with refugees from northern vietnam a 
government spokesman said friday 
refugees from the north and south have been living in the san 
yick factory building which was described as unsuitable for human 
habitation said the spokesman 
he said 456 refugees from northern vietnam moved thursday to the 
new camp 
the spokesman who requested anonymity said officials of the 
un high commission were trying to persuade the southern 
vietnamese to move also 
the spokesman said there have been no reports of any clashes 
between the north and south vietnamese at san yick the building 
was turned into a refugee camp in august because of the heavy 
influx of boat people from vietnam 
he said the southerners merely expressed their unease at moving 
to a camp of mixed population 
the hong kong government has decided to close the 12story san 
yick building where conditions have been described by un 
officials as comparable to a prison

tens of thousands of serbs rallied 
friday to protest the outcome of a communist party meeting and 
yugoslavias parliament debated a series of economic and 
constitutional reforms 
the state news agency tanjug said at least 75000 serbs attended 
three rallies held to support slobodan milosevic the communist 
party leader of yugoslavias largest republic after he suffered a 
setback at a party meeting that ended wednesday 
tanjugs estimates of crowds have regularly proved excessive in 
recent weeks telephone calls to local police and journalists 
failed to yield an independent crowd estimate 
one of the rallies was in milosevics native area of pozerevac 
in central serbia but the serbian leader did not attend 
a reporter for a local radio station reached by telephone from 
belgrade estimated the crowd at 50000 and said it assembled in 
pouring rain 
two other rallies were held at ruma 25 miles north of belgrade 
and velika plana the same distance east of belgrade tanjug said 
25000 people attended the latter rally 
all three rallies were organized by the communistdominated 
socialist alliance in support of milosevic 
the serbian leader has vowed to contest a central committee vote 
of no confidence in ally dusan ckrebic a serbian member of the 
communist partys ruling politburo 
the vote was seen as a criticism of milosevic who has backed 
months of serbian nationalist protests that have combined with 
economic unrest and culminated in calls for new national and 
regional leadership 
squabbles between the rival regional party factions have 
jeopardized economic and constitutional reforms that were proposed 
to stimulate foreign investment joint ventures and a 
marketoriented economy 
milosevics campaign for greater serbian control over its two 
provinces of kosovo and vojvodina has centered on reforming 
yugoslavias 1974 constitution 
milosevic argues that serbia needs more say to protect the serb 
and montenegrin minority in kosovo from alleged harassment by the 
ethnic albanian majority 
parliaments president dusan popovski has threatened to resign 
if the constitutional reforms are not approved by the 
communistdominated legislature he told deputies friday the 
amendments are designed to enhance serbias position in its two 
provinces 
another squabble surrounding the constitutional reform is the 
refusal of the liberal northern republic of slovenia to endorse a 
proposal to rearrange financing for yugoslavias armed forces 
the army now is financed from the federal budget but has 
complained that tripledigit inflation is forcing it to solicit 
loans from state banks to stave off financial collapse 
slovenia contends the new constitutional arrangements would 
enable the army to tap the resources of yugoslavias six republics 
and two provinces 
the dispute could block adoption of the entire constitutional 
package since such a decision must be adopted by unanimous consent 
the package is due to be adopted by nov 29

sen sam nunn dga said friday if he were the 
democratic presidential candidate his campaign would be on 
stronger ground than that of michael dukakis because he would not 
have let the republicans use him for a punching bag 
nunn said it may not be too late for the massachusetts governor 
to stage a rally but that dukakis has really got to take off the 
gloves hes got to defend himself 
nunn commented in an interview before addressing a governmental 
affairs seminar sponsored by the georgia press association 
the states senior senator considered a bid for the democratic 
nomination last year but ultimately ruled it out he said he has no 
regrets about the decision 
if i had been pining away to be president of the united states 
and that had been a lifetime ambition i guess i would have been in 
the race to begin with but not having had that ambition and still 
not having that ambition in any kind of keen way it doesnt bother 
me he said 
asked if he believed his campaign would have been in better 
shape now than many polls show the dukakis campaign to be nunn 
said 
if i had gotten the nomination i would think so but its 
very hard to speculate and the campaign would have been so totally 
different republican nominee george bush might have been running 
against me for being too conservative 
nunn continued i wouldnt have been a punching bag on some of 
these issues there are some very unfair allegations going on and 
what ive been amazed at is how the bush campaign has been able to 
get away with it and to be fairly successful at it so far dukakis 
has really got to take off the gloves hes got to defend himself 
nunn is to appear with dukakis in georgia on saturday at a rally 
in hawkinsville the senator said he is also making campaign 
appearances in florida mississippi and louisiana for the 
democratic presidential nominee 
he said that despite the polls it is not too late for dukakis to 
turn the race around 
right now the polls certainly mean something but theyre 
not firm i think theres an awful lot of give and take in them it 
could end up like it is now but i think that would be a 
coincidence its not because people have made up their minds

six companies cargill inc 100000 tons louis dreyfus corp 
70000 nichimem america inc 40000 entrade international ltd 
40000 continental grain co 110000 and bunge corp 40000 
melvin e sims general manager for the departments foreign 
agricultural service said the sales were part of an authorized 2 
million tons of wheat announced on aug 18 under the export 
enhancement program or eep 
although no selling prices or other details were announced 
recent prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around 386 
per bushel indicating a us farm value of about 57 million 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
under current and previous eep arrangements china as of oct 13 
had already bought 374 million tons of subsidized us wheat for 
delivery in the 198889 marketing year that began last june 1 plus 
further sales this week 
the program enables exporters to sell wheat and other designated 
commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to 
meet foreign competition the exporters then collect free 
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or 
subsidies 
sims said the bonuses due the six exporters for the latest deal 
averaged 2284 per ton of wheat or about 62 cents per bushel 
china has an additional 960000 tons of us wheat available

nbc has pulled an ad for the miniseries 
favorite son showing a character questioning the qualifications 
of a senator being considered as a vice presidential candidate 
however a network official said friday that the decision to 
pull the promotion which began being aired shortly after the first 
debate between the presidential candidates sept 25 was made 
before republican officials contacted the network the ad was 
yanked thursday 
nbc entertainment president brandon tartikoff made the 
decision several weeks ago that the whole political approach of the 
promos should be toned down said michael ohara vice president 
for media relations west coast 
the decision to remove that promo was made independent of any 
calls to us to consider removing it ohara said in a call from 
new york nbc internally made the decision that we would be 
better off going in another direction 
ohara said a republican campaign official had telephoned robert 
hynes an nbc vice president for government relations to express 
his concern about the promos he did not know the name of the 
official 
the promo taken from a scene in the show has the president 
ask you think a man should be vice president because he looks 
good on television 
it could be seen as a reference to sen daniel quayle the 
republican vice presidential candidate who has been criticized by 
some as lacking credentials 
its a coincidence said ohara steve sohmer wrote this 
book two years ago before anybody ever heard of sen quayle its 
a real coincidence much like the movie china syndrome coming out 
at the time of the three mile island accident 
favorite son is a threepart sixhour miniseries based on 
the bestselling political thriller by sohmer it is set for 
telecast a week before the election oct 30nov 1 
a major theme of both the book and the miniseries is how 
television affects the selection and the election of candidates and 
how the medium is vulnerable to manipulation 
sohmer is a former vice president for promotion at nbc and cbs 
he was noted for being the whiz kid whose adroit use of promos 
helped make nbc no 1 
in favorite son a relatively unknown senator becomes a hero 
during the assassination of a contra leader on the steps of the 
capitol the senator suffers a minor wound but staggers to the 
microphone to make an impassioned speech as television cameras roll 
it is a week before the partys presidential convention the 
polls show the incumbent could lose and the suddenly famous senator 
looks like the choice to give the ticket the boost it needs 
sohmer said in an interview last spring that he thought many 
people would think of presidential hopeful gary hart because of 
certain sexual aspects of the book he said the book was written 
long before hart became a candidate or was forced to withdraw

a french construction company signed an agreement 
friday with other french and soviet partners to build a luxury 
medicalhotel complex in moscow to perform eye surgery on 4000 
foreign patients a year 
the project by the bouygues company represents the first time 
such an ambitious project has been set up jointly by western and 
soviet interests 
the overall cost of the project will exceed 73 million and 
bouygues share of the contract to build and develop the center is 
67 million said martin bouygues managing director of the public 
works and construction group 
he added that studies for similar eye clinic projects using an 
eye surgery technique developed by sviatoslav fiodorov are at an 
advanced stage in abu dhabi malaysia and west berlin there have 
also been preliminary discussions on modernizing an expanding a 
swiss eye clinic 
the move is a diversification for french group bouygues 
officials said since the joint venture has exclusive rights 
outside the soviet union for the production line technique 
developed by fiodorov 
the joint ventures soviet partners are mntk and vnesheconombank 
holding 57 percent bouygues will put up 25 percent of the capital 
while pullman international hotels a unit of frances 
internationale des wagons lits will have a 5 percent stake and 
will operate the fivestar hotel complex 
four french banks will together control the remaining 13 
percent they include stateowned banque nationale de paris and 
credit lyonnais banque de lunion europeenne and banque 
commerciale de leurope du nord 
bouygues said the venture was made possible by the perestroika 
policy adopted by the soviet union he said its success would be 
reinforced if the soviet union fulfills its pledge to make the 
ruble a convertible currency in the coming years 
bouygues officials said the contract has been worded in such a 
way as to enable the western partners to repatriate hardcurrency 
profits

eight years after a vietnamese man 
left his homeland in a crowded fishing boat he is helping organize 
a benefit concert for vietnamese boat people living in a refugee 
camp in thailand 
if we as vietnamese people do not help then no one will 
help said khanh nguyen 31 a technician for honeywell inc 
nguyen and seven other vietnamese put together the concert of 
traditional and modern vietnamese music and dance by performers 
from california michigan and canada the concert is saturday in 
this minneapolis suburb 
i dont want to devote all my life looking for food and just 
survive said nguyen i want to help and contribute to 
society 
we have everything they have nothing said tu nguyen 
another organizer who is not related to khanh nguyen 
the group hopes to raise 3000 and give it to the american red 
cross to help 4000 refugees in the thai border camp of ban thad 
the state department estimates that 300 to 400 vietnamese have 
landed on thai shores in the past several months to discourage 
other refugees the thai government is not allowing the ban thad 
residents to resettle in another country according to the 
department 
thai officials are urging vietnamese seeking to emigrate from 
their homeland to join overseas relatives under a 
usgovernmentsponsored resettlement plan rather than coming to 
thailand 
tong nguyen the groups chairman called treatment of the ban 
thad refugees an injustice we know the people who become 
refugees are those who risk their lives to be free 
tong nguyen came to the united states a day before south vietnam 
fell to the communists in 1975 and is now a refugee resettlement 
worker for catholic charities of the archdiocese of st paul and 
minneapolis 
minnesota has about 8000 vietnamese most of them in the twin 
cities many of them with individual success stories like khanh 
nguyen and his wife 
three days after leaving vietnam they landed in thailand 
attacked by pirates the refugees had been robbed of their money 
and gold nguyen lost the rosary that his mother gave him 
the couple spent several months in a refugee camp and then came 
to the united states 
this is the second time local vietnamese have been involved in a 
benefit concert for refugees in 1986 they raised 5000 to help a 
west german rescue mission of vietnamese boat people tong nguyen

demonstratrations that were broken up by police it was reported 
friday 
the prague national committee ruled that the right to organize 
public gatherings in the historical center of prague is limited to

more than 80 antiwar protesters including 
the police chiefs wife were arrested friday outside honeywell 
inc on the 20th anniversary of the honeywell project a peace 
activist organization 
minneapolis police chief tony bouza didnt seem embarrassed by 
his wifes arrest which he thought was her sixth 
i think one would be upset if she was selling drugs to 
children but an act of conscience is not something thats going 
to get me too upset bouza said about his wife erica 
when she left the house friday bouza said my last words to 
her were are you going to get arrested and she said i dont 
know 
he said his wife had made a promise after the last time she was 
jailed in 1986 that she wouldnt be arrested again during the 
rest of his term he plans to retire at the end of this year 
i think her conscience overwhelmed her he said 
mrs bouza was booked on trespassing charges said sgt patrick 
conboy seventysix others also were charged with trespassing and 
five who threw blood on the defense contractors property were 
charged with damage to property said deputy chief douglas smith 
both charges are misdemeanors all 82 protesters were released 
smith said 
police said mrs bouza was the second person who climbed a 
ladder over a brick wall surrounding the honeywell facility 
bouza who has repeatedly expressed a handsoff approach to his 
wifes antiwar activity joked about it friday 
if she goes to jail im not going to insist on conjugal 
rights he said 
but he quickly turned serious shes been to jail before 
twice of course she worries about it its a very painful 
business nobody likes to go to jail 
the honeywell project was founded in 1968 to protest the 
companys manufacture of components for cluster bombs used in 
southeast asia 
with fridays 20th anniversary protest i think there was a 
carrying forth of the idea that we will continue what we are 
doing said a honeywell project staffer sue ann martinson 
fridays demonstration to protest honeywells role in the 
manufacture of weapons parts began with a candlelight vigil near 
company headquarters 
eventually a crowd estimated at 300 gathered outside honeywell 
conboy said 
the protesters poured a bloodlike substance on the ground to 
symbolize what they said was the blood honeywell has on its hands 
for its role in weapons manufacturing said martinson 
company officials issued a statement defending its role in 
weapons production without making a specific reference to the 
protesters 
we believe that free people working together should 
determine the appropriate programs and expenditures to establish 
and sustain their national security the statement said this 
process requires public debate including the democratic right to 
disagree throughout history this right itself has always had to 
be defended

the city is preparing its toughest action yet 
against its legendary traffic snarls 
mayor pietro giubilo said thursday night the city wants to allow 
cars on the streets only on alternate days depending on odd or 
even license plates during the christmas shopping season 
the plan which must be approved by a special city council 
commission would be in force from dec 1 to dec 23 it could be 
extended depending on its success 
we are in an emergency that needs crash therapy giubilo 
said 
in recent years the city has barred areas of downtown to most 
private cars established special lanes for buses and asked 
commuters to use public transportation 
the measures appear to have had little effect there are 16 
million cars registered in the city of some 3 million people 
merchants say the alternate plate idea would discourage 
shoppers they want the city to build parking lots and new subway 
lines 
opponents on the city council said the plan wont really cut 
traffic because there arent enough police to enforce it and many 
families have two cars

california gray whales like the three 
trapped by arctic ice off the northern coast of alaska have one of 
the longest migration routes of all mammals and are among the last 
of their species 
the trapped whales didnt leave in time on the annual migration 
from the arctic to the warm water off baja california 6000 to 
8000 miles 
california gray whales must leave the arctic before winter 
because they are not adapted for icy conditions and have relatively 
thin blubber for insulation said mark palmer executive director 
of the whale center in oakland 
he said the whales also cannot break through ice and cannot dive 
underneath ice for any great distance 
the whales can only spend an average of 3 to 6 minutes 
underwater at a time during their migration he said 
there used to be three distinct populations of gray whales 
including the california group another group in the north atlantic 
ocean and one on the asian coast said steve bailey a marine 
biologist with the california academy of sciences in san francisco 
however the group in the north atlantic became extinct hundreds 
of years ago and the asian group is almost extinct said bailey 
the california gray whales number about 20000 
the california gray whale averages about 35 feet in length and 
weighs about 30 tons marine biologists said 
the gray whales which may actually be black or dark gray feed 
on small animals that live on the ocean floor

kuwaiti naval experts have detonated a 
mine found floating in the northern persian gulf the official news 
agency kuna said friday it was at least the fifth mine found in 
the area in the last two months 
the news agency quoting a defense ministry source said the 
mine was discovered by a kuwaiti naval patrol boat and was 
detonated it did not say when the incident occurred or what type 
of mine it was 
us officials say there are perhaps as many as 200 mines still 
in the persian gulf most of them in the northern waters where both 
iran and iraq placed the contact explosives to protect or block 
access to local ports 
the us officials say the menace of floating mines is 
increasing because of winter storms that will cause them to break 
loose from their underwater moorings and drift southward with 
prevailing currents 
gen george b crist senior commander of us military forces 
in the region said in a recent interview that discussions on the 
mine problem were under way at the united nations and in 
washington but he said it was not yet clear who would eventually 
take on the task of mineclearing in the gulf

he plans to seek a court injunction to get his client reinstated 
amayeobu 34 a fourthyear medical student from nigeria was 
suspended aug 25 until may 15 1989 for slapping his daughter at 
their home he was scheduled to graduate next may then start his 
residency 
the incident occurred aug 4 at a universityowned housing 
coimplex 
amayeobu said he had asked his daughter to put dinner on the 
table the girl apparently shouted at him and he slapped her 
i dont tolerate that kind of rudeness amayeobu said 
her behavior is intolerable 
the day after she was slapped the girl reported it to the 
university police department amayeobu was arrested for aggravated 
child abuse according to the police report 
he was released the next day on his own recognizance

affairs said in a letter dated aug 25 that amayeobu was being 
suspended for physically abusing his daughter 
this is a matter the university should not be involved in 
amayeobu said

i think its wrong for administrators at the university of 
florida to get involved in family matters especially when youre 
talking about parents raising their children moore said 
the student code of conduct says we will hold students 
accountable for all matters ms stevens said wednesday we 
have a right to have guidelines for students

have refused to overturn ms stevens decision although scott has 
agreed to review the case in december

develop more acceptable approaches in dealing with people 
including members of your family written documentation verifying 
this counseling is required 
as a result of the suspension amayeobuu was evicted from 
university housing and denied any financial aid the 15yearold is

the environmental protection agency 
violated its own rules in approving the shipment of 47000 tons of 
toxic texas soil to an alabama landfill a federal judge said 
friday as he temporarily blocked the transfer 
us district judge robert varner said federal officials failed 
to properly notify alabama that the epa had approved the shipment 
of pcbcontaminated dirt from houston to chemical waste management 
incs west alabama disposal facility 
truck shipments from the geneva industries site in texas to the 
emelle landfill were to begin saturday 
the texas site contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls is 
part of the federal superfund cleanup program pcbs once were 
commonly used in electrical transformers as a coolant but have 
since been banned 
the alabama landfill is the nations largest commercial 
hazardous waste disposal site 
chris grimshawe a spokesman with chemical waste management 
said the company had a 161 million contract to dispose of the 
2000 truckloads of dirt he said the amount of pcbs actually 
contained in the soil would fill one tractortrailer rig 
we have had bigger but its a pretty good size contract he 
said 
bradley bridgewater a justice department attorney representing 
the epa argued alabama was not included under epa guidelines 
governing the shipment of toxic wastes and therefore no warning 
was needed 
varner dismissed the claim 
do you think that the split end who catches a forward pass is 
an affected party certainly he is varner said it seems to me 
that alabama is a receiving state to the toxic waste 
varner did not rule on whether the pcb shipments posed an 
environmental hazard but he said with an epa director who did 
not follow the law in approving the shipment im afraid there 
may be 
varner said he would hear arguments as soon as next week on 
whether to extend the prohibition requested by gov guy hunt and 
state attorney general don siegelman 
siegelman who attended the hearing praised the ruling while 
hunt attending a trade meeting in south carolina had no immediate 
comment

the world series victory by the dodgers may 
be a boost to the michael dukakis campaign with history showing 
the democrats with the clear edge in presidential elections when 
the national league wins the baseball championship 
since 1908 the democrats have won five of seven elections when 
the national league finished on top but have lost eight of 13 
elections when the american league prevailed 
the republicans must be mourning the american league loss last 
night since it foreshadows a republican loss on nov 8 in the world 
series of politics said steve hopcraft a dukakis spokesman 
but republicans have recent history on their side ronald reagan 
bucked tradition to win the white house in 1980 after the

royals four games to two 
the only other republican to do that was william h taft who 
beat democrat william j bryant in 1908 after the national leagues 
chicago cubs defeated the detroit tigers four games to one

dollars and defrauded us banks 
according to the indictment marcos transferred 103 million 
into the united states to buy manhattan real estate and also 
defrauded banking institutions of more than 165 million in the 
purchase and financing of those properties 
the indictment charged that between 1972 and 1986 when marcos 
and his wife imelda fled to the united states they accumulated 
millions of dollars through embezzlement theft bribes and 
kickbacks 
this is a plan hatched and begun in the phillipines to move 
massive amounts of money illegally into the united states said 
us attorney rudolph giuliani then the marcoses came to the 
united states and continued their illegal activities 
he said at least 250 million in property would be subject to 
forfeiture 
no one is above the law giuliani said 
the marcoses who have spent their exile in hawaii were ordered 
to appear in federal court oct 31 
in honolulu marcos remained in seclusion but his 
washingtonbased attorney richard hibey told reporters he had 
been offered a drop dead deal in which government attorneys 
refused to negotiate a settlement 
this was not a plea bargain it was a set of nonnegotiable 
demands hibey said 
marcos is well he is alert and hes looking forward to 
defending himself hibey said mrs marcos is as strong and as 
resolute about defending herself as the president 
hibey said the marcoses will plead innocent 
marcos health however will be a major factor in the case 
hibey said 
i am personally concernedthat he may not be physically able 
to withstand the rigors of a criminal trial of this scope and 
magnitude said hibey who described marcos health as frail 
also charged with racketeering were saudi arabian financier 
adnan khashoggi bienvenido tantoco sr former philippine 
ambassador to the vatican his wife gliceria once the president 
of rustans a filipino department store the los angelesbased 
california overseas bank its chairman roberto s benedicto and 
the banks former president rodolfo t aranbulo 
a spokesman for president reagan who was in kentucky today 
said the president is saddened by the indictments because 
marcos is an old friend and a friend of the country 
but its clear that the justice department has a very strong 
case and it will proceed through the system white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the grand jury charges are the culmination of a criminal 
investigation launched nearly 2 years ago by giuliani 
the sixcount indictment charges the marcoses engaged in a 
pattern of racketeering activities to divert philippine 
government funds and cash and stock garnered through bribes and 
kickbacks to us investments 
from 1981 to 1983 the marcoses transferred 103 million to buy 
four valuable manhattan properties including commercial buildings 
at herald square and on fifth avenue madison avenue and wall 
street the indictments say 
the marcoses and their alleged coracketeers were also accused 
of obstucting justice in a civil lawsuit filed by the filipino 
government to reclaim the manhattan properties 
the marcoses the tantocos and khashoggi allegedly plotted to 
conceal the true ownership of the four buildiungs through false 
documents 
the marcoses are also accused of a scheme to buy 59 million in 
art objects and also transporting money and certain works of art 
they knew to be stolen 
the indictment also charges that the marcoses and tantocos 
defrauded two us banks citibank and security pacific national 
bank and the security pacific mortgage corp of more than 165 
million in order to buy one of the buildings and refinance others 
under the racketeering laws the government is seeking 
forfeiture of all the defendants property obtained through illegal 
activity for the marcoses that includes the four new york 
buildings foreign bank accounts and other property interest they 
hold 
the government also is seeking forfeiture of khashoggis 
condominium at the posh olympic towers in manhattan as well as 
bank accounts and any interest he holds in the four buildings 
the indictment charges khashoggi joined a scheme to backdate his 
interest in the marcosowned buildings to prevent the philippines 
from winning them in us court 
khashoggi is also accused of submitting a false document to 
french officials seeking evidence at us request in the marcos 
investigation 
all of those charged with racketeering and racketeering 
conspiracy face a maximum of 20 years in prison and 250000 in 
fines on each count 
the marcoses the tantocos their son bienvenido jr jaime 
alberto arias a panamanian attorney associated with the tantocos 
and khashoggi associate karl bock peterson were charged with one 
count of obstructing justice and one count of mail fraud for their 
part in the scheme to conceal the ownership of the buildings they 
would face up to five years in prison on each count if convicted 
khashoggi would face an additional 15year penalty on each of 
two obstruction of justice counts 
khashoggi a central figure in the secret sale of arms to iran 
by the reagan administration posed as the owner of valuable 
paintings and new york property secretly held by the marcoses 
according to court documents filed earlier 
the justice department decided to move against marcos 71 after 
his lawyers involved in plea bargaining negotiations with federal 
prosecutors missed a deadline thursday afternoon to respond to a 
demand that he plead guilty to a racketeering charge according to 
federal sources in washington 
earlier thursday president reagan indicated he would step aside 
and not intervene to stop a marcos indictment saying that in order 
to bring the matter to him i would think that it would have to 
be a matter of foreign policy 
reagan said it may not come to my desk at all 
engaging in plea bargaining discussions prior to indictment was 
a concession by the justice department to the state department 
which urged such a course in an attempt to avoid indicting the 
former head of state justice department officials had wanted an 
indictment to precede any plea bargaining negotiations 
in manila philippine officials today hailed reports of an 
impending indictment of marcos as a major breakthrough in efforts 
to collect the billions he allegedly embezzled as president 
the philippine government has filed 39 civil suits against 
marcos seeking to collect 967 billion in damages but no criminal 
charges have been filed because officials fear marcos would insist 
on his constitutional right to return to the philippines from 
hawaii to face his accusers in court since the philippine 
constitution forbids criminal trials in absentia 
on thursday president corazon aquino said that a us 
indictment of marcos would speed recovery of the embezzeled funds 
she said marcos would still be subject to prosecution in the 
philippines regardless of american legal moves 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater had indicated last week 
that reagan would be the ultimate arbiter on the delicate matter of 
indicting a onetime us ally but on thursday fitzwater backed 
away from that

eight months after the reagan administration 
decided it would rather have a smaller military than a hollow 
one the armed services have met their assigned goals of slashing a 
combined 36000 positions 
the defense department in a routine monthly manpower strength 
update said friday that 2136747 men and women were in uniform 
and on active duty as of sept 30 the end of fiscal 1988 
that represents a drop of 37470 people under arms compared with 
sept 30 1987 exceeding the reduction goal of 35890 that defense 
secretary frank c carlucci set last february 
the decline also represents the largest swing in us military 
strength from one year to the next since 1976 when the american 
armed forces lost 46210 men and women in the winddown after the 
vietnam war 
under carluccis directive revealed in february when he sent 
the pentagons fiscal 1989 budget proposal to congress the army 
navy air force and marine corps now will be expected to maintain 
their combined strength at roughly 2138000 for the next 12 months 
the monthly totals are expected to vary however due to normal 
swings in the arrival of new recruits and reenlistment patterns 
most of the reductions were made through changes in recruiting 
goals tighter reenlistment standards and early out incentives 
fridays report showed the air force and marine corps began 
fiscal 1989 still slightly above the target figures carlucci gave 
them while the army and navy began the year below their assigned 
targets 
as of sept 30 the air force reported activeduty strength of 
576446 down 30589 compared with sept 30 1987 but still 
slightly above the target of 575603 
the marine corps said it had 197350 men and women on active 
duty at the end of last month down 2175 compared with yearago 
levels but not quite down to the target of 197224 
the army meantime had 771847 men and women on active duty 
down 8968 compared with yearago levels it had been given a 
target of 772300 
and the navy the only one of the four services authorized to 
increase slightly in size in fiscal 1988 didnt grow quite as 
fast as expected as of sept 30 it had 591104 on active duty up 
4262 compared with sept 30 1987 but still slightly below its 
target of 593200 
statistically the cutbacks reported friday amount to only 17 
percent of the force that was on duty a year ago the cuts 
however are viewed on capitol hill and inside the pentagon as a 
clear sign of the difficult budget environment that will confront 
the next president 
carlucci told congress in february that he and president reagan 
thought the fiscal 1989 budget compromise failed to provide enough 
money for defense and that the united states would face a higher 
security risk as a result 
in that environment he said the united states should maintain 
a lean wellequipped force and hope for the best rather than a 
larger force that couldnt be equipped properly 
weve made the hard choices here carlucci said at the time 
we have traded off a smaller force in order to maintain a quality 
force 
congress ultimately accepted carluccis decision on the size of 
the military in approving the fiscal 1989 defense authorization 
bill which totals 2995 billion

a compromise antidrug bill includes a 
provision for warning labels on alcoholic beverages 
the labels would be added a year after the bills enactment 
the message according to the surgeon general women should 
not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk 
of birth defects consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your 
ability to drive a car or operate machinery and may cause health 
problems 
sen strom thurmond rsc the author of the language has 
been trying for 19 years to have congress pass the warning label 
provision 
this has been a long difficult fight to warn consumers of the 
dangers associated with alcohol abuse thurmond said however 
today i can say unquestionably that it was well worth the effort 
what we are able to accomplish now is to provide information 
so consumers of alcohol can make an informed decision 
thurmond said it was not his intention to stop people from 
drinking but to better inform the public of the problems 
associated with the abuse of alcohol

a federal judge said friday that a 
settlement in principle has been reached between plaintiffs and 
defendants in litigation stemming from the collapse of lambiance 
plaza apartment house 
its up to the lawyers to iron out the implementation us 
district judge robert c zampano said not all of the obstacles 
are resolved but we dont see any insurmountable obstacles 
he declined to discuss any details of the settlement involving 
the collapse during construction in bridgeport including any 
monetary damages 
zampano and state superior court judge frank s meadow have been 
mediating discussions among the lawyers for 44 plaintiffs 
families of the 28 men killed in the collapse and 16 injured 
workers and 39 defendants including builders and the city of 
bridgeport 
the judges aim was to settle the estimated 200 lawsuits that 
experts said they expected to result from the collapse it could 
have taken 10 years to 15 years for all the suits to make their 
ways through the court system 
ninetytwo lawyers have been involved in the negotiations which 
began in february 
lambiance plaza being built in the lift slab method in 
which concrete floor slabs are poured on the ground and then jacked 
into place collapsed while a floor was being hoisted on april 23 
1987 
zampano said he still must meet with some defendants to settle 
their contractual disputes 
he said another matter still outstanding is 51 million total 
in fines issued last year by the federal occupational safety and 
health administration against five companies for violations of 
safety regulations at the building site 
lawyers for the defendants had hoped to make the osha fines part 
of the settlement 
as part of a minimum settlement proposal already accepted by the 
plaintiffs lambiance plaza would be rebuilt under court 
trusteeship part of the buildings profits would go to annuities 
set up for the injured and families of the men killed 
kevin coles a bridgeport attorney who represents texstar 
construction co of san antonio texas one of the lambiance 
contractors said these things are very sensitive but i 
agree a settlement in principle has been reached there are a lot 
of details to be worked out but im optimistic about it 
attorneys for the plaintiffs didnt immediately return telephone 
calls seeking comment friday 
zampano said plaintiffs and defendants attorneys will meet 
oct 31 to discuss how to implement the settlement 
the famous saying is it aint over till its over but the 
mere fact that the lawyers will sit down with a purpose of meeting 
to discuss the appropriate paperwork is good zampano said 
he also said details of reconstructing the building have not 
been worked out 
all i can do is commend parties on both sides for their 
cooperation and dedication to the settlement process he said 
he said if all goes well the deal will be completed within 30 
days

a man who robbed a convenience store 
and then sued it for injuries he got while fleeing had the tables 
turned on him by a jury that awarded the clerk 25000 in a 
counterclaim 
i cant believe someone would rob a store and then expect 
people to pay for his doctor bills said clerk joseph sheffield 
who was robbed at gunpoint in january 1987 it doesnt seem 
right 
a circuit court jury decided thursday it would not award alvin 
charles hampton any money for his injuries and ordered him 
instead to pay sherffield 25000 
we wanted to send a message to criminals and potential 
criminals that youre going to have to pay for your crime by 
serving time and you may have to pay money too said one 
unidentified juror 
hamptons attorney henry davis argued that although his client 
was fleeing from the scene of a crime he should be paid for his 
injuries 
the crime was over when the crime was over he had the same 
rights as anyone else injured on the highway davis said 
but lil champ convenience stores attorney nolan winn told 
jurors when you commit a crime you assume a risk that you might 
get hurt especially when the crime involves a gun 
the jury deliberated 25 minutes before reaching its verdict 
on jan 19 1987 a gunman took 100 and a dozen cartons of 
cigarettes from the store sheffield jumped into his pickup truck 
and chased the robber for about 10 blocks 
the clerk rammed his truck into the back of the getaway car 
forcing it to crash into a tree 
hampton 34 who later pleaded guilty suffered a broken hip 
when hampton who is serving a nineandahalfyear sentence for 
the robbery sued lil champ in august 1987 the company 
countersued seeking damages for the assault on its clerk

democrat michael dukakis charged in a tough new tv ad friday 
that george bush is airing commercials that are full of lies and 
he knows it bush leading in the polls turned to a condemnation 
of chemical weapons 
trailing with just 17 days remaining until the election the 
dukakis campaign unveiled its most pointed ads of the year 
accusing bush of distorting dukakis record on crime and defense 
the massachusetts governor set the stage earlier friday when he 
said on network talk shows ive been subject to attacks and 
distortions and the american people are not happy with this 
campaign because it had been too negative 
he said bushs attack on the massachusetts prisonerfurlough 
program was cynical and very hypocritical the bush camp has 
made much of the fact that willie horton a convicted murderer 
escaped while on furlough raped a maryland woman and assaulted her 
fiance 
to play politics with that kind of human tragedy i think is 
one of the most cynical things you can do dukakis said 
in one of the new tv spots dukakis is shown watching a bush 
campaign ad depicting dukakis riding in an armored tank dukakis 
snaps off the tv turns to the viewer and says he is fed up 
with bushs attacks 
havent seen anything like it in 25 years of public life 
george bushs negative tv ads distorting my record full of lies 
and he knows it dukakis says in his own ad 
he accuses bush of dragging truth into the gutter and adds 
im on the record for the very weapons systems his ads say im 
against 
sig rogich bushs ad director defended the republicans 
commercials saying theres nothing erroneous about any of those 
ads or the truth of the matter is the networks wouldnt accept 
them we stand by everything we have in our ads 
the republicans were on the attack too 
bush seeking ohios 23 electoral votes said dukakis 
opposition to the spacebased missile defense system known as star 
wars was bad for the country 
the last thing we or our allies need at a time when ballistic 
missiles are proliferating is someone who regards strategic defense 
as a fraud or a fantasy he said in an address at the university 
of toledo 
in the main thrust of his speech bush said he wants to be known 
as the president who helped achieve an effective ban on chemical 
weapons a subject he said had gained new urgency with their recent 
use in the iraniraq war 
he said countries guilty of chemical warfare should face the 
censure of all nations and he proposed other measures such as 
onsite inspection on demand of suspicious plants 
the dukakis campaign has accused bush of being hypocritical on 
the chemical warfare issue since he cast tiebreaking votes in the 
senate to continue stockpiling new germ and chemical weapons in 
1983 and 1986 but a bush aide said the reagan administration felt 
it was better to put the old deteriorating us chemical weapons in 
new safer forms 
dukakis has been stepping up his counterattacks against bush 
allegations recently as polls have indicated hes lagging in the 
fight for the white house 
peace broke out briefly thursday as the two presidential 
candidates appeared jointly at the alfred e smith charity dinner 
in new york where republicans say dukakis oncestrong support is 
shaky the two men are also scheduled to attend an italianamerican 
dinner saturday night in washington 
dukakis on friday tried to rally new york city voters by 
pledging to wage an antidrug war that should know no bounds 
he said bush was more interested in photo opportunities than in 
waging a real fight against drugs one of his new ads also attacks 
bush as ineffective on the drug issue and casts doubts on gop vice 
presidential candidate dan quayles ability to take over the 
administrations drug fight in a bush presidency 
bush got a strong defense from president reagan campaigning in 
kentucky for the gop ticket reagan said he had given bush some 
of the most sensitive and difficult tasks weve had and hes never 
let me or the country down 
reagan also said that dukakis if elected would choose liberal 
activists soft on crime to fill supreme court vacancies dukakis 
in his morning tv interviews defended his judicial appointments in 
massachusetts saying im looking for people of independence 
intelligence integrity 
the nominees running mates were also on the campaign trail 
democrat lloyd bentsen told nursing students in san antonio texas 
that the dukakis ticket stood for programs needed by working women 
including pay equity day care an increased minimum wage and the 
equal rights amendment 
quayle in an attack on dukakis mocked bentsens stern 
admonishment to him during their oct 5 debates bentsen had told 
quayle youre no jack kennedy when quayle tried to compare his 
age and legislative experience to kennedys in 1960 
noting that some have suggested dukakis will stage a late 
comeback similar to trumans in 1948 quayle said in a johnson 
city tenn speech i dont know michael dukakis i never served 
with michael dukakis michael dukakis is not a good friend of mine 
but i know this michael dukakis is no harry truman

democrat michael dukakis whose television 
commercials so far have drawn little more than criticism unveiled 
a series of fiery new ads friday attacking his republican opponents 
by name and calling their tv spots full of lies 
im fed up with it an angry dukakis says in an ad titled 
counterpunch the governor is shown snapping off a television 
set showing a negative commercial for republican presidential 
nominee george bush 
havent seen anything like it in 25 years in public life 
dukakis says george bushs negative tv ads distorting my 
record full of lies and he knows it 
dukakis goes on to assert that both candidates support a strong 
defense so this isnt about defense issues its about dragging 
the truth into the gutter and im not going to let them do it 
dukakis says striking the pose of a fighter 
reflecting the candidates underdog status after months of 
broadcast pummeling by vice president bush all four of the new 
dukakis ads make some mention of bush or his running mate sen dan 
quayle 
the counterpunch ad and a similar spot titled 
differences also try to build a closer connection between 
dukakis and the viewer than many of his previous advertisements 
some of which were faulted as too abstract 
but even the most positive moments in the new advertisements 
lack the balloons flags and traditional madison ave touches 
there arent any suit coats either instead dukakis is shown in 
his shirtsleeves speaking directly to the viewer as the camera 
moves to a closeup shot of his face 
dukakis campaign aides said the messages would begin airing this 
weekend in battleground states but they would not say exactly 
where or at what cost 
these ads are about george bushs hypocrisy and the campaign 
of distortion george bush has chosen to run dukakis spokesman 
mark gearan said george bush doesnt want this campaign to be 
about his record so hes used lies and distortions and labels 
sig rogich ad director for the bush campaign defended the gop 
commercials saying theres nothing erroneous about any of those 
ads or the truth of the matter is the networks wouldnt accept 
them they check the facts and so do we we stand by everything we 
have in our ads 
in the final 2 weeks the dukakis campaign hopes to lash back 
at bush and at the same time step out from the bush onslaught and 
talk directly to voters plans call for dukakis to grant lengthy 
television interviews and to buy chunks of prime time 
the new dukakis ads include two blistering flatout 
negative spots one aimed at bush and quayle the other aimed 
at bushs advertising campaign 
in a spot titled effort a narrator savages the bush effort 
to stop drugs from entering the united states while the screen 
shows blackandwhite images of bundles of cocaine children buying 
drugs and bush meeting with panamanian dictator manuel noriega 
shifting the attack onto quayle the ad goes on to ask if 
george bush couldnt handle the job how do you think quayle is 
gonna do 
the fourth ad attempts to rebut a bush ad that depicts a 
revolving door in the massachusetts prison system and reminds 
viewers that a convicted murderer fled from a massachusetts 
furlough and terrorized a maryland couple 
the dukakis advertisement asserts that the massachusetts 
furlough program was begun by a republican governor which is true 
and that it was stopped by mike dukakis but it does not 
mention that dukakis bowed to public pressure and did not eliminate 
the program until faced with a referendum campaign 
dukakis who has called bush cynical for making political 
hay out of a human tragedy uses the same technique turning the 
spotlight on the federal prison furlough system 
bush wont talk about this drug pusher one of his furloughed 
heroin dealers who raped and murdered patsy pedrin pregnant 
mother of two the ad says as the victims body is shown being 
removed from a house on a stretcher

supreme court justice sandra day oconnors 
plan to return to work just 10 days after breast cancer surgery is 
a remarkably fast recovery and may be good news for her 
prognosis a breast cancer expert said friday 
dr robert s siegel assistant professor of medicine and 
director of a cancer treatment unit at george washington university 
hospital said the justices announced plans to return to the bench 
by oct 31 is a pretty quick return to work 
ten days is on the swift side siegel said that would be 
a remarkably fast recovery 
siegel was not involved in mrs oconnors case and he was 
commenting generally on conditions such as hers but he said the 
speed with which she plans to return to work may indicate the 
cancer was caught at a very early time and that there is no 
indication it has spread to other organs in the body 
in a typical breast cancer case caught at a very early stage 
siegel said the patient can choose to have either a lumpectomy in 
which the tumor and only the tumor is removed from the breast or 
a modified radical mastectomy in which the entire breast is 
removed 
whichever procedure is used however it also typically involves 
removal of the lymph glands under the arm 
for a lumpectomy patients usually are released from the 
hospital in three days to four days he said but usually return in 
two weeks to start radiation therapy 
the radiation in appropriate doses usually is given once a 
day four to five days a week for four to six weeks 
for most patients this is a difficult period because the 
radiation causes fatigue 
it would be difficult to maintain a full schedule while 
receiving radiation said siegel although he noted that some 
patients handle it much more easily than others 
mrs oconnor said in a statement released by the court that the 
cancer had been found in a very early form however neither her 
statement nor the court indicated whether or not she would undergo 
additional therapy 
patients receiving a modified radical mastectomy do not require 
the radiation therapy and usually return to work within two weeks 
to three weeks 
whichever procedure is used siegel said the patient will go 
through a full battery of diagnostic testing this would include 
special xray studies of the bone and the abdominal organs and a 
group of blood chemistry tests 
if these tests reveal the presence of cancer elsewhere then 
there would be additional therapy or even more surgery 
siegel said the national cancer institute also has recommended 
that those who had a lumpectomy also undergo adjuvant 
treatment this could include chemotherpy in which the patient is 
given drugs designed to kill cancer cells or hormonal treatment 
in which the patient is given hormones that discourage cancer cell 
development

opposition leader cuauhtemoc cardenas said 
friday he will turn his democratic reform movement into a new 
political party to challenge 60 years of domination by the

congress on friday passed compromise 
legislation that would further restrict lobbying by former 
executive branch officials and apply lobbying restraints to former 
members of congress for the first time 
the bill went to the president after the house approved it 
3477 and the senate followed suit by voice vote 
the legislation would bar departing members of congress from 
lobbying their former colleagues in either chamber for one year an 
earlier house version would have barred exlawmakers from lobbying 
only in the branch where they served 
the chief house sponsor rep barney frank dmass said the 
legislation would affect only former members who lobby for 
compensation on behalf of others not those who merely give advice 
the bill would retain the current lifetime ban in current law 
that prevents executive branch employees from lobbying on any issue 
in which they had a personal and substantial involvement while 
in government service 
the legislation would bar former federal trade officials for a 
year after leaving from lobbying for a foreign government or 
foreigncontrolled entity the house bill however would allow the 
former official to work for the foreign government or entity if he 
or she does not lobby an earlier senate version would have banned 
employment or lobbying for a year 
top congressional aides would be barred for a year from lobbying 
their own member or the members personal staff and top committee 
staff would be prohibited for the same period from lobbying the 
committees members or staff 
cabinet members and their top deputies would be prohibited from 
lobbying their agency for one year after leaving and top executive 
branch staff could not lobby their agency for a year without 
approval from the office of government ethics 
the bill provides for maximum penalties of 250000 in fines and 
five years in prison any proceeds received in violation of the law 
would be subject to forfeiture in a civil action 
rep douglas h bosco dcalif said there were only 
perceived abuses by former members of congress but no evidence 
of actual wrongdoing 
were creating a reality here in the minds of the american 
people he said 
ann mcbride senior vice president of the common cause citizens 
lobby said that with its action congress began the long road to 
restoring ethics and integrity in government 
congressional passage of this legislation strengthens 
revolving door restrictions on executive branch officials and ends 
a double standard by covering members of congress and senior 
congressional staff for the first time she said

investigators have disproved a dying 
mans claim that he planted the bomb that killed four black girls 
at a church in 1963 two prosecutors said friday 
the investigations said us attorney frank donaldson reveal 
that gary a tucker is the confessor of a crime he did not 
commit 
tucker a 54yearold man who is dying of cancer at a veterans 
administration hospital in tuscaloosa told officers last week that 
he and another person placed the bomb at the 16th street baptist 
church the bomb exploded on sunday sept 15 1963 killing the 
four girls who were in a lounge preparing to take part in a youth 
program 
donaldson said that tucker made several statements all of 
them have been thoroughly investigated there is no question about 
it tuckers statements are not credible efforts were made to 
corroborate his statements this could not be done in fact they 
were disproved 
donaldson said he was disappointed because he had hoped this 
horrible crime would be finally laid to rest 
jefferson county district attorney david barber said that a 
person tucker named as an accomplice was in a state prison at the 
time of the bombing 
when compared with the knowledge gathered in previous 
investigations and the facts we learned in this investigation his 
story is simply not credible barber said at a news conference 
with donaldson 
relatives and friends of tucker had said he suffers from 
hallucinations and that they believed he was merely seeking 
attention 
a ku klux klansman robert chambliss was convicted in 1977 of 
murder in one of the bombing deaths and died in prison eight years 
later while serving a life term 
donaldson and barber said their files on the case are still 
open since there is no statute of limitations on murder but they 
said they have no leads 
barber said that several things in tuckers statement were 
inconsistent where the church is descriptions of three 
different automobiles he said he drove to the church where he 
lived where he worked 
nothing he said was consistent with the facts other than 
things he gleaned from newspapers 
tucker barber said said he realized he is dying that he 
doesnt have long to live and that he wanted to get this off his 
conscience 
donaldson said he hoped that news accounts of the investigations 
into tuckers statements will cause some people to come forth 
with information that is helpful we might get a deathbed statement 
sometime i had hoped that might have been the case this time 
the crime was so horrendous we have to follow up on anything 
especially socalled confessions 
barber said he sympathized with the families of the victims of 
this atrocity for having to relive their nightmare for the past 
week

another round of handwritten anonymous 
letters harassing blacks women and homosexuals at dartmouth 
college has students on edge and school officials looking for clues 
dartmouth is not going to permit that kind of intimidation 
college spokesman alex huppe said friday its not a situation 
that we would allow to go unchecked 
about five letters sent in recent weeks to students and faculty 
are similar to about 20 letters sent last spring to sorority house 
residents members of the afroamerican society the dartmouth gay 
and lesbian organization and the womens issues league 
huppe said the hanover police department is working with the 
school it appears most letters were sent through campus mail not 
the us postal service he said which makes them even harder to 
trace 
after the spring mailing dartmouth hired specialists to analyze 
the handwriting 
in a letter sent to students last week dean edward shanahan 
said officials believe the letters may have been written by someone 
no longer enrolled at the ivy league school 
shanahan also said some of the harassment may be generated by 
more than one person 
im disturbed about the behavior and what its doing to the 
students shanahan told the valley news of west lebanon its 
certainly frightening some of the students and it worries me to 
think it might not stop at the letters and other kinds of 
harassment that have been present here 
its been 15 years since dartmouth became coed said robert 
lasser a senior from miami beach fla but the problem here is 
there still is a maledominated presence that really isnt willing 
to allow women to equally participate on this campus 
its been very frightening said kris moller a member of 
the womens issues league who has received three letters since 
may one of them last week its definitely had an effect on the 
way i do things it made me want to lay low for awhile but i 
cant 
she said the latest letter had leaves glued to the paper with 
chewedup gum and the words leaf dartmouth alone and you 
still disgust us 
i know this guy is targeting me for my feminist views what is 
really frightening is that there is really a kind of twisted 
creativity at work here she said 
allegra burnette another member of the womens issues league 
said shes seen many derogatory comments against women and blacks 
etched into wooden desks 
stuff like this is all over school and im sure a lot of it 
has been there for years she said

older consumers who spend about 900 billion 
annually are unhappy with how they are portrayed by americas 
advertisers and dont mind squawking about it a researcher said 
the mail survey of 1000 people aged 55 and older also found 82 
percent of them believe the products they buy dont work as 
promised and 75 percent of those who are unhappy let others know 
the survey by george p moschis also found about onethird of 
the respondents had boycotted products or services because of what 
they thought was inappropriate age stereotyping of their ads 
while part of the problems is madison avenues youthoriented 
approach moschis said most importantly is when older people are 
portrayed in ads they are not portrayed in a desirable fashion 
they are shown as senile cranky that kind of image 
the marketers and advertisers are not trained 
gerontologists moschis a professor of marketing and director of 
the center for mature consumer studies at georgia state university 
said friday 
on the other hand gerontologists that know something about 
older people have not been able to translate that knowledge into 
marketing strategy 
that will become more important as the babyboom generation ages 
when the babyboomers hit that 55plus age bracket in about 
10 12 years or so i think its going to be amplified in terms of 
importance he said 
moschis 44 said the over55 population already controls more 
than threefourths of the countrys wealth and has more than 50 
percent of the countrys discretionary income in addition he 
said people 55 and older control 80 percent of all deposits in the 
nations savings and loan institutions 
a report to be published sunday by the university of southern 
california and the national institute of aging indicates that clout 
will only grow with a quarter of the population over 65 years old 
by 2040 
moschis categorized four kinds of consumers 
healthy hermits he said 38 percent of the respondents fell 
into this category described as in good health psychologically 
withdrawn from society with few social contacts and little 
interest in staying active 
ailing outgoers the other side of the coin accounts for 34 
percent the survey indicated described as in poor health 
unwilling to accept old age status socially active health 
conscious interest in learning to do new things 
frail recluses fifteen percent of the respondents fell into 
this category identifies as in poor health socially and 
psychologically withdrawn inactive concerned with daytoday 
tasks retired 
healthy indulgers these 13 percent are in very good health 
socially engaged are selfsatisfiers independent want the most 
out of life and are relatively wealthy 
the mail survey was conducted of a randomly selected sample 
drawn from all 50 states the margin of error is plus or minus 3

palestinian and proiranian guerrilla bases in south lebanon on 
friday and killed 15 people to avenge seven israeli soldiers who 
died in a suicide car bombing 
in beirut shiite moslem kidnappers holding at least two 
american hostages threatened to punish their captives in 
retaliation for the israeli strikes 
police said 35 people were wounded in the halfhour israeli 
attacks including civilians in a clinic they said 12 israeli 
fighterbombers and two helicopter gunships made seven bombing runs 
the main targets of the attack were training bases and 
ammunition dumps of the iranianbacked hezbollah and the palestine 
liberation organization near the port city of sidon and the bekaa 
valley town of mashgara 
sidon provincial capital of south lebanon is 25 miles south of 
beirut mashgara which faces the forward lines of the syrian army 
is 16 miles east of sidon 
the fundamentalist shiite moslem hezbollah or party of god 
claimed responsibility for wednesdays car bombing which also 
wounded eight israeli soldiers and two lebanese women 
the air raids were israels 16th into lebanon this year a 
police spokesman said on condition of anonymity that eight people 
were killed and 15 wounded around sidon and that seven were killed 
and 20 wounded in mashgara 
the jets scored direct hits on a hezbollah ammunition depot near 
the palestinian refugee camp of mieh mieh on the outskirts of sidon 
and set it ablaze the spokesman said 
two of the rockets slammed into a hezbollah clinic attached to 
its main base in mashgara and two lebanese physicians and three 
nurses were injured the spokesman said 
most of the wounded in mashgara were civilians at the 
clinic he said 
wailing women beat their chests while workers pulled victims 
from the rubble of hezbollahs clinic a child climbed on top of 
the debris to plant the partys red white and green flag 
ambulances with gunmen shooting into the air raced past and 
flames shot up from the smoking arms depot 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah hezbollahs spiritual guide 
said the air raid targeted the clinic 
our mujahedeen holy warriors strike at soldiers and they 
strike at civilians our arm is longer than israels 
fadlallah said in a sermon at a south beirut mosque crowded with 
shiites 
hezbollah is an umbrella group for shiite militants believed 
holding most of the nine americans and five other foreign hostages 
in lebanon 
fridays threat to the hostages came in typewritten statements 
in arabic signed by the islamic jihad the faction holding 
associated press middle east correspondent terry anderson and 
educator thomas sutherland 
a statement delivered to a western news agency included an 
instant color photograph of anderson in a beard and tshirt 
the criminal america must realize it will not get away with 
what it has done especially in connection with the hostages we 
hold the statement said 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman called 
for an end to violence between israel and lebanon and urged 
lebanese kidnappers to free their hostages 
the police spokesman said the warplanes fired 18 rockets into 
two bases used by hezbollah in mashgara while the helicopters 
strafed the town and its surroundings he said syrian troops were 
not involved 
guerrilla defenders opened up with antiaircraft fire as the 
jets released scarlet balloons to deflect heatseeking 
surfacetoair missiles no planes were hit he said 
the israelis also hit two training bases run by plo chairman 
yasser arafats mainstream fatah faction in mieh mieh and the 
nearby camp of ein elhilweh he said 
fawzieh mattar 37 said she saw the first rocket slamming into 
the depot near sidon

explosion accompanied by a big ball of fire and several explosions 
followed said ms mattar a palestinian who lives at mieh mieh 
with her parents 
she said several refugees evacuated the camp after wednesdays 
car bombing in anticipation of israeli retaliation but her family 
didnt have any place to go 
hiam saleh 18 said her father also refused to evacuate his 
family of seven 
we stayed in an air raid shelter in the camp but occasionally 
i came out to watch the planes attacking ms saleh said very 
few civilians were wounded by shrapnel most of the casualties were 
combatants manning the depot and fatah base 
israeli gunners in israels selfproclaimed security zone of 
south lebanon also hammered the town and the nearby village of 
luwayzeh with 155 mm howitzers 
in jerusalem the military command said the raid was aimed at 
palestinian targets in the sidon area and hezbollah command posts 
in the villages of mashgara and luwayzeh 
israeli officials often charge that hezbollah and the plo are 
cooperating in guerrilla warfare against israeli troops and allied 
militiamen in south lebanon 
the jewish state vowed to retaliate for wednesdays bombing the 
deadliest attack against israelis in south lebanon in 2 years in 
march 1985 a suicide driver detonated a car bomb killing 12 
israelis and wounding 14 
israel pulled most of its army from south lebanon in june 1985 
after a threeyear occupation and carved out the 6 to 10mile 
security zone to prevent guerrilla infiltration into its northern 
settlements 
police say 26 people were killed and 108 wounded in the previous

longest war

reagan expresses the sense of congress that the memorial be 
built at the site of the vietnam veterans memorial one of the

proposed amendments to the soviet constitution 
will concentrate power in the new presidency established by 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
but a summary of the amendments released friday by the tass news 
agency said nothing about multiple candidates or multiple parties 
in soviet elections which are controlled by the communist party 
earlier reports had indicated there could be a choice of 
candidates in some electoral contests but with all of the nominees 
approved by the communist party 
a draft of the amendments includes gorbachevs proposal for a 
limit of two fiveyear terms for every elected position gorbachev 
was named president three weeks ago in an uncontested unanimous 
vote by the supreme soviet or parliament and he is expected to 
seek a second term 
under the proposals the president will be elected by secret 
ballot by the 2250member parliament that will meet just once a 
year 
the tass summary reflected earlier reports and confirmed that 
gorbachev obtained the reforms he requested at the communist party 
conference in june 
it would give the president the power to head the defense 
council name the governments top officials and to sign laws 
gorbachev had requested the defense council chairmanship in his 
speech at the party conference but subsequent report made no 
mention of that issue and there had been speculation it had been 
dropped 
tass did not say if the presidents authority to sign laws meant 
he would have the veto power 
complete drafts of the constitutional and election reforms are 
to be published in newspapers saturday and sunday 
the official news media said the presidium of the supreme soviet 
will review public opinion on the proposals until nov 25 
no reason was given for the nov 25 date but diplomats here 
expect the parliament to hold a special session in november to 
consider the amendments

the government and owners of a grounded 
ship on friday abandoned plans to sink the vessel and its cargo of 
about 3000 cars 
the decison followed a protest by environmentalists claiming the 
dumping would hurt marine life 
the government said the plans were abandoned because bad weather 
had damaged the 58000ton vessel the reijin making it impossible 
to float the ship far enough out to sea to dump the cars 
because of the weather the reijins hull has fractured 
jose macario correia secretary of state for the environment and 
natural resources told the associated press 
the cars will probably be transported to the shore and 
disposed of and we are also looking into ways of dismantling the 
ship totally to bring it to shore he said 
the announcement came after a group of environmentalists boarded 
the ship early friday and unfurled banners with message not into 
the sea to protest the planned dumping 
this is a victory for us said vitor marques spokesman for 
the portuguese environmentalist group quercus earlier marine 
police detained three quercus protesters after the police boarded 
the ship to put out a small fire of unknown cause 
the three were taken to the police court at vila nova de gaia a 
suburb on the southern outskirts of oporto a police spokesman 
said he declined to say how long they would be detained 
marques earlier said the protesters would stay on the ship until 
the portuguese government took action to stop the dumping 
the panamanianregistered reijin was on its maiden voyage from 
japan to ireland when it ran aground april 27 off the northern city 
of oporto it had stopped in oporto to unload some of its cargo of 
about 5400 new japanese cars one sailor died in the accident 
the ships owner emerald shipholding sa a japaneseowned 
panamanian company began dumping cars into the atlantic ocean in 
september as part of a project to get rid of both the ship and its 
cargo 
officials said the ship couldnt be recovered and the cars might 
be unsafe for use after being stuck for six months so close to sea 
water 
ecologists say the estimated total of 173 tons of copper and 
lead 115 tons of paint 28 tons of oil and more than 1000 tons of 
rubber plastics and textiles contained in the cars could also hurt 
marine life 
the navy issued a dumping permit august and installed observers 
to ensure the cargo was sunk at least 40 miles from shore 
marques said the greenpeace environmental group had sent an 
official to give quercus its support the two groups issued a 
statement friday demanding that the reijin be towed into a harbor 
and that the cars be unloaded and disposed of on shore

president augusto pinochet replaced half 
of his 16member cabinet on friday and indicated he will not run in 
an open election for the presidency next year 
both actions were seen as a response to pinonchets defeat in an 
oct 5 referendum in that election voters rejected the proposal 
that gen pinochet also army commander remain in the presidency 
until 1997 pinochet was the only candidate in the presidential 
referendum 
he has ruled chile since september 1973 when he led the coup 
that ousted the elected government of marxist president salvador 
allende he died in the coup 
i will hand over my post to the person that citizens elect 
freely secretly and in an informed fashion on dec 14 1989 
pinochet said in a speech at the swearingin ceremony for the new 
ministers 
it was the first time he had addressed the issue of whether he 
would be a candidate in the balloting next year however he did 
not elaborate 
pinochet named eight new cabinet members all civilians and 
shifted one minister to another post the seven other ministers 
including some military officers remained in their jobs 
the most important change was the naming of carlos caceres a 
48yearold technocrat to replace sergio fernandez as interior 
minister the post with the most political power 
opposition leaders have called for the removal of fernandez who 
had rejected appeals for negotiations on democratic reforms of the 
8yearold constitution drawn up by pinochets military government 
pinochet had also rejected such changes 
but pinochet said he was not surrendering to the oppositions 
demands sirs the constitution will not be modified he said 
this issue is not at stake 
he named hernan errazuriz who once served as ambassador to the 
united states as foreign minister replacing ricardo garcia 
miguel poduje was moved from the housing ministry to replace 
orlando poblete as government secretarygeneral a post equivalent 
to a chief of staff 
pinochet was reported to be furious with some cabinet members 
including fernandez and poblete accusing them of tricking him 
into believing he would win the referendum 
pinochet 72 lost the referendum by a vote of 39 million to 
31 million but under the constitution he will continue as head of 
state until march 1990 when the winner of the l989 election will 
take office 
there had been speculation that pinochet might run in the open 
election in any case political observers expect him as the army 
commander to have a strong voice in the naming the governments 
candidate 
other new ministers are jaime de la sota in agriculture armando 
alvarez national property guillermo arthur labor pablo 
barahona mining gustavo montero housing and carlos silva 
transportation 
remaining in the cabinet are retired adm patricio carvajal 
defense hernan buchi finance gen manuel concha economy juan 
antonio guzman education hugo rosende justice gen bruno 
siebert public works and juan giaconi health 
it was the 40th cabinet named by pinochet since 1973 
fernandez and poblete oversaw pinochets campaign in the 
octaober referendum 
poblete was accused of altering the results of 
governmentcontracted polls two days before the election to give 
the impression pinochet was leading 
after the vote fernandez said in a nationally broadcast address 
that the results were positive for pinochet he said the yes 
votes showed pinochet was chiles principal political leader 
but most rightwing political leaders who had backed pinochet 
quickly withdrew their support 
caceres who received a masters degree in business 
administration from cornell university and was a visiting professor 
at ohio state university is considered more moderate than 
fernandez he had served as finance minister under pinochet in the 
early 1980s 
jorge burgos assistant secretarygeneral of the opposition 
christian democratic party said a change of names doesnt tell 
us much the important thing is to see what the new men will 
actually do 
the christian democrats chiles largest party led a 16party 
coalition that campaigned for pinochets defeat in the referendum

the us government refused to negotiate with 
former philippine president ferdinand marcos offering him a 
dropdead deal that forced his indictment on racketeering 
charges marcos lawyer said friday 
this was not a plea bargain it was a set of nonnegotiable 
demands richard hibey marcos washingtonbased attorney said 
at a news conference 
marcos and his wife imelda were indicted on federal 
racketeering charges friday for allegedly looting more than 100 
million from their homeland to buy art and real estate in manhattan 
they also were charged with defrauding three lending 
institutions of more than 165 million in the purchase and 
financing of the real estate 
the marcoses would plead innocent when arraigned oct 31 hibey 
said 
they vigorously will defend the charges that have been laid 
against them in this case he said the charges are false 
neither ferdinand nor imelda marcos spoke to reporters after the 
indictments were handed down in new york city and hibey said they 
were not expected to comment until after their arraignment 
hibey said marcos had been given until thursday to accept or 
reject a deal which would have required him and his wife to plead 
guilty to felony racketeering charges and testify against others 
including family members with no assurances they would not be 
jailed hibey said 
the us government knew marcos would reject the dropdead 
deal hibey said adding that marcos attorneys were still willing 
to negotiate a global settlement is not out of the question as 
far as were concerned he said 
hibey refused to detail what settlement marcos offered the us 
government but said money was never discussed we offered to 
enter into meaningful negotiations with the united states and the 
philippines he said 
he also refused to outline marcos defense but said the former 
presidents health and jurisdiction issues would figure prominently 
i am personally concerned that he may not be physically 
able to withstand the rigors of a criminal trial of this scope and 
magnitude said hibey who described the 71yearold marcos as 
frail 
the issue of his health is definitely going to permeate this 
case he said in the 2 years marcos has lived in hawaii he has 
been treated for a variety of illnesses including chest pains and 
an eye ailment 
the united states recently renegotiated base agreements for us 
installations in the philippines paying far less than the 
philippine government first demanded 
hibey said those negotiations were tied to a us promise to 
indict marcos and criticized the government of philippine president 
corazon aquino for deferring to the united states 
the coincidence is too strong to ignore he said the 
people of the philippines if not of the united states know this 
is part of a political vendetta against the marcoses 
hogwash said tomas gomez the philippine consul in 
honolulu of hibeys allegation mr hibeys comparing apples in 
oranges mr marcos will face criminal indictments in the 
philippines eventually the long road to retribution and 
restitution has begun 
asked whether marcos felt betrayed by president reagan who 
refused to intervene in the case hibey said i cant speak for 
mr marcos but the president was responsible for having him 
brought to the united states 
marcos fled to hawaii in february 1986 after a civilianmilitary 
revolt catapulted philippine president corazon aquino to power 
marcos has maintained since that he was tricked by us officials 
who told him he would be taken to his home province of ilocos norte 
marcos spokesman arturo aruiza said the marcoses reacted calmly 
to the indictments 
hes been up since early this morning reading his law 
books aruiza said mrs marcos is a little bit upset but 
shes been expecting this

our legislation grants him the veterans benefits he 
deserves said sen lloyd bentsen a texas democrat calvin 
graham at a very young age made a great contribution to our

former lt gov clifford a jones of 
nevada has gone into hiding here to avoid arrest in connection with 
a lawsuit brought by an exassociate in city casino operations his 
attorney said friday 
gil vela jones attorney said ecuadorean authorities tried to 
arrest the 76yearold las vegas lawyer and twotime nevada 
lieutenant governor on oct 11 but could not find him 
mr jones is avoiding being detained until the formal order of 
detention is revoked vela told the associated press in a 
telephone interview 
he said the order stems from a countersuit which alleges jones 
committed perjury during an earlier quito stock fraud case 
in the earlier case vela said jones sued ecuadorean douglas 
albuja and others associates accusing them of seizing his stock in 
catursa a local casino and tourism company 
vela did not give the names or the numbers of others involved in 
the catursa suit nor when it occurred he said jones held 50 
percent of the stock in the company which owned the casinos at the 
hotel quito hotel colon and hotel alameda 
albuja countersued in 1987 accusing jones of perjury in the 
catursa case vela said 
a judge ordered jones detained in march but he entered ecuador 
a few months ago unaware of the court order vela said 
my counsel has been that he should not circulate freely 
because the arrest order still exists we are trying to get it 
dropped vela said 
vela said that next week the judge is likely to either drop the 
case against jones and revoke the detention order or call for the 
case to go to a full trial

lloyd bentsen pulled on his blue jeans and 
cowboy boots and rode on a hay wagon friday as he tried to convince 
texans that michael dukakis is not soft on crime and antidefense 
the republicans have preferred diatribe to dialogue they 
mass market innuendo and camouflage the fact about dukakis he 
said 
the texas senator said democrats would spend just as much on 
defense as the republicans but they would crack down on the 
kickbacks to contractors and focus more on convention weapons than 
nuclear missiles 
i wouldnt be running on a ticket with a candidate who would 
weaken americas defense the democratic vice presidential 
nominee said at a barbecue for 600 people 
the republican ads attacking dukakis on crime by highlighting 
the massachusetts prison furlough program were slander he 
said and ignored the fact that dukakis toughened a program he 
inherited from the previous republican governor as it turns out 
the massachusetts furlough is tougher than that in texas he said 
the republican assertion that dukakis wants to take away 
everyones guns was crazy he said the truth is that mike 
dukakis supports the right of americans to own guns to protect 
themselves their homes their business he supports the right of 
americans to own guns for hunting he said 
friday evening in houston he told a local meeting of the naacp 
that for republican vice presidential nominee dan quayle civil 
rights does not rank high on his list of priorities he cited 
quayles votes against south africa sanctions against the 1988 
civil rights restoration act support for the supreme court 
nomination of robert bork and opposition to affirmative action 
and lets also remember that george bush can run from the 
facts but he cant hide from the truth bentsen said after 
all he was vice president of the united states while this 
administration was was waging its onslaught and trying to turn back 
the tide of progress on civil rights 
i am not aware of any occasion when when the vice president 
questioned or disagreed with the administration policies on civil 
rights he said 
i cant recall a time when he stood up for what is right and 
just in america he said 
they see no problems and offer no answers in george bushs 
america if you havent made it forget it he said 
at the barbecue in abeline bentsens speech was made from 
behind a lectern with the initials lb burned into the front a 
pair of covered wagons were in the background and a band called 
ray peck and the half breeds provided entertainment including 
a song dedicated to the democratic ticket 
usually seen in his washington suits bentsen wore black cowboy 
boots blue jeans and a plaid shirt and string tie for the event 
he said was comfortable 
earlier when he was still in his suit bentse told nursing 
students friday that the democratic ticket stood for the programs 
needed by working women including pay equity day care an 
increased minimum wage and the equal rights amendment 
were with you were the party of progress for the working 
women of america said bentsen 
he accused the republicans of trying to cut back on prenatal 
care and health care for children and he ridiculed the gop 
objection to federal standards for day care 
we have stronger federal standards on dog food than we have on 
day care protection for our children he said 
while the reagan administration has opposed an increase in the 
minimum wage and george bush has waffled on the issue he said 
seven out of eight jobs filled by women since 1980 have been 
paying at the poverty level 
we wont rest until american women have equal access to 
opportunity and a fair share of the american dream he said 
getting loud applause from the mostlyfemale audience at the san 
antonio health science center 
democrats have in recent years been more popular with women than 
the republicans a phenomenon known as the gender gap but 
recent polls have shown the gap has closed 
bentsens press secretary mike mccurry said the speech today 
was aimed particularly at women in texas the campaign has found 
that much of the deterioration in the tickets standing in the 
state were it now trails in the polls has been with young working 
women he said

a federal judge friday held the state in 
contempt of court for overcrowding in a section of the state prison 
and threatened fines of 50 per extra inmate per day 
this court has finally regretfully reached the end of its 
joblike patience with overcrowding at the intake service center 
of the adult correctional institution us district judge raymond 
j pettine wrote 
pettine said if the population at the intake unit in cranston 
exceeds 250 after feb 20 he will levy the fines he gave the 
state until nov 21 to come up with a new plan for reducing the 
inmate population at the center which holds prisoners awaiting 
trail 
as of friday morning the intake units population was 431 
inmates said corrections department spokesmen joseph a dinitto 
at that level the daily fine would be 9050 
i cant foresee theres any possibility of meeting that 
deadline since weve been at 450 in there in recent days said 
state corrections director john j moran 
inmates with the help of the american civil liberties union 
sued in 1977 to correct numerous problems they contended existed at 
the prison 
john biafore assistant legal counsel to gov edward d diprete 
blamed the overcrowding on more drugrelated arrests and 
legislation making bail harder to obtain biafore said the 
governors aides had met with judges to speed procedures for 
releasing those eligible for bail 
it was working but no one can explain why over the last three 
to four months theres been such a great amount of drug arrests

council be established in the next few days to prepare for county

iron pills may be unhealthy for people who dont 
have anemia because of the possibility that excessive iron 
increases the risk of cancer a new study concludes 
too little iron is clearly hazardous but the latest research 
suggests that too much may also be bad the study based on a large 
population survey found links between high body levels of iron and 
cancer of the colon lungs bladder and esophagus in men 
iron supplementation for those who are not amenic may be 
unwise the study concluded 
despite the statistical association however this research does 
not actually prove that iron promotes cancer or that too much iron 
in the diet is dangerous 
because the link is tentative the studys chief author dr 
richard g stevens was reluctant to make specific health 
recommendations but he said if its true it might be wise to 
reconsider the iron supplementation of foods in our grocery 
stores 
he cautioned that people with iron deficiency should continue to 
take iron supplements more study will be necessary to prove 
whether high iron levels and especially ironrich food increase 
the risk of cancer 
stevens an epidemiologist at batelle pacific northwest 
laboratories in richland wash conducted the study with doctors 
from the national cancer institute it was published in thursdays 
new england journal of medicine 
his conclusions were based on blood samples taken from more than 
14000 people over the past two decades in the national health and 
nutrition survey 
the latest study found that the overall cancer risk was 37 
percent higher in men with high iron levels than in those with low 
levels 
in earlier research dr joseph selby of kaiser hospital in 
oakland calif found a similar association during a study of 
45000 people in northern california 
there is a good deal of biological plausability to the 
hypothesis that too much iron causes cancer selby said on the 
other hand all of the evidence in humans to date is both very weak 
and very indirect and about as far from conclusive as you can get 
stevens study did not find any association between cancer and 
iron levels in women but the researchers could not rule out that 
such a link exists 
however selby said if this association turns out to be 
true women who are premenopausal have little or nothing to worry 
about since most of them have little iron stores most are close 
to iron deficiency because they lose iron each month through 
menstruation 
stevens said his study should not be used for recommendations 
about what people should eat in fact he said that food could turn 
out to have little effect on iron storage because iron levels may 
be largely under the control of the bodys builtin regulators 
dr katherine mcglynn of the fox chase cancer center in 
philadelphia is organizing a study to see if giving blood which 
lowers iron levels protects people against cancer 
people have long studied the consequences of iron 
deficiency she said its only recently that people have 
studied iron overloading and raised the possibility that we have 
gone overboard in fortifying all the food in sight 
stevens study was based on blood levels of a protein called 
transferrin which picks up iron in the small intestines and 
transports it throughout the body levels of this protein are 
thought to mirror the amount of iron stored in the body 
experts theorize that too much iron may contribute to cancer by 
promoting oxidation that damages the genes and by providing a 
nutrient that cancerous cells need to grow

gov edward dipretes policy director 
has resigned amid a storm of controversy over the hiring and firing 
of the exwife of a reputed mobster from a state job 
ronald diorio announced his resignation thursday night hours 
after francesca coats went public with complaints about the way she 
was dismissed from a job on the governors justice commission that 
she held for two days she also charged that diorio promised her 
another job if she avoided speaking to the media 
on friday the governor said he was aware when he hired ronald 
diorio as his policy director that diorios brother also had 
alleged mob ties 
diprete told reporters that he hired diorio anyway because 
diorio a former teachers union leader had a record of being 
independent of his brother richard moon diorio 
the controversy comes at an awkward time for diprete who is 
running for reelection against a stiff challenge by democrat bruce 
g sundlun polls show sundlun who lost to diprete by a 21 margin 
in 1986 has pulled even in the race 
ms coats was divorced in 1986 from nicholas l bianco who has 
been identified by law enforcement officials as a powerful member 
of the new england organized crime family headed by the late 
raymond ls patriarca 
ms coats at a news conference and in subsequent interviews 
charged diorio knew about her background when she was hired may 25 
to coordinate an interagency task force for the justice commission 
she said he did not object to her hiring until newspaper articles 
this week raised questions about it ms coats began work for the 
commission monday 
diorio and his top aide william mccann said they were not 
aware of ms coats background until tuesday when mccann told her 
she was fired 
ms coats however said diorio personally fired her wednesday 
in a meeting with her and her lawyer william a dimitri jr at 
which he told her if i would take steps to avoid the media and 
allow them to handle the situation the way they chose that on nov 
9 i would be taen care of 
diorio told the providence journal he offered to help ms coats 
find another job after the busy election season ended but that she 
misunderstood his offer 
attempts to reach diorio for further comment friday were 
unsuccessful he did not return telephone messages left at his home 
or his former office or with dipretes press secretary 
richard diorio testified during 1986 hearings on the impeachment 
of state chief justice joseph bevilacqua who allegedly had 
associated with organized crime figures 
diprete said ronald diorio had discussed his brother when he 
became policy director in october 1985 
i was absolutely convinced that there would be no influence or 
connection in any way i knew of the situation he explained it to 
me he wanted to let me know that would have no bearing on his 
personal relationship or professional relationship or anything to 
do with state government and history has shown that to be true 
diprete said 
ms coats and diorio agreed that she was initially offered two 
jobs one with the justice commission and the other coordinating an 
antidrug project called the teen institute she took the justice 
commission position after the director of the agency running the 
teen institute decided to hire someone else 
diprete in a statement issued thursday night said ms coats 
does not in my judgment have the background and qualifications 
necessary for the justice commission job 
sundlun seeking to make political hay from the controversy 
said friday he would give ms coats a job if elected governor 
there is no evidence that mrs coats is herself an unfit 
person or an unfit member of society sundlun replied the 
reason they fired mrs coats was they felt the embarrassment that

the nations airlines are being told to 
examine the takeoff warning horns on two of the industrys most 
widely used jetliners after faulty alarms were found in 35 of the 
aircraft 
the inspections on nearly 1800 boeing 727s and 737s which were 
ordered thursday by the federal aviation administration comes as 
federal accident investigators continue to try to determine whether 
an alarm may have failed on a delta air lines boeing 727 that 
crashed last august at the dallasfort worth airport 
the alarm is designed to sound if a pilot has forgotten to 
prepare an aircraft properly for takeoff such as leaving wing 
flaps which help give a plane lift in the wrong position 
the national transportation safety board has said there is 
evidence though not conclusively determined that the flaps may 
not have been in the proper position on the delta jet yet a 
cockpit voice recorder tape shows the alarm did not sound the ntsb 
investigation into the crash which killed 14 people is not yet 
completed

a comet striking earth with the power of 300 
million hiroshimasized atomic bombs may be the cause of mass 
extinction 11 million years ago say scientists who blame a bigger 
blast for killing the dinosaurs eons earlier 
the scientists new study means that of nine mass extinction 
episodes in earths history three that occurred about 11 million 
38 million and 66 million years ago now have been linked to comets 
or asteroids smacking into the planet 
the highly controversial theory says such impacts kicked up dust 
and triggered smoky fires that blocked enough sunlight to freeze 
many creatures and deprive others of food supplies 
other new studies bolster support for rival theories that blame 
mass extinctions on gigantic volcanic eruptions on changes in sea 
level or on global climate changes unrelated to objects smashing

roy benjamin has a great idea for 
companies seeking ways to establish themselves in the great chinese 
consumer market of the future give them books he says 
benjamin already has spoken to officials of the chinese 
publishers association who assured him that each title would get 
at least 20 readings since each book would be loaned to the reader 
and then redistributed 
multiply a few million books by 20 exposures per book and you 
see the impact the program would have says benjamin who knows 
what hes talking about his company based in this new york 
suburb pioneered the sponsored book concept 
sponsors are not altogether altruistic he explains their 
names logos or messages would appear on the back covers of the 
paperback books being distributed the resulting good will he 
says would be incalculable 
some of americas largest companies attest to that claim kraft 
offers a cheese cookbook at a discount to show consumers ways to 
use cheese in recipes toyota offered an olympic guidebook to 
potential buyers of automobiles 
for the 100th anniversary of upjohn benjamin published an 
elaborate coffeetable book that was distributed to all upjohn 
employees and retirees and sent also to doctors pharmacists 
colleges and libraries 
such promotions may not have the hypedup razzledazzle 
gimmicks of the quicksell advertising in vogue over the past two 
decades or more benjamin concedes the medium is old as the 
hills or at least as old as gutenberg but he says while 
hardsell is ephemeral book sponsorship is enduring 
a book stays in the home or office is constantly referred to 
and is a continuing reminder to the consumer of the sponsors name 
and product or service says benjamin 
ted benjamin the president joins in 
there is no distraction or competitive clutter of other 
advertisers message he says books do not break they can be 
packed in on or near the product displayed dramatically mailed 
easily 
books have been the benjamin brothers livelihood since they 
founded the company 35 years ago and their press runs have been in 
the many millions while most publishers only dream of such 
numbers the benjamins involvement in book creation is less 
obvious than most instead the sponsor takes the bows 
many volumes have large popular sales such as dos and taboos 
around the world a parker pen promotion translated into several 
languages but no matter how great the popular sales they cant 
compare with the corporate distribution which often rises to well 
above a million volumes per title 
some already are classics before being reproduced by benjamin 
such as a series of childrens illustrated titles tom sawyer 
the wizard of oz a christmas carol and others offered 
free by mcdonalds restaurants 
many are cook books for sears procter amp gamble holly farms 
lipton stokely vancamp jennair oster martha white tupperware 
and more 
health books for institutions such as the american cancer 
society and for companies seeking sensible health habits among 
employees are popular enthusiasm for volumes on money management 
is probably as high 
corporate stories are forever popular typical the goodyear 
story and a century of light which traces the general 
electric company backs to edison 
in publishing circles the association with business labels 
benjamin as corporate americas publisher or as a 
publishingmarketing organization but its interests range more 
broadly 
in the benjamin brothers concept business makes useful 
valuable information available and as a consequence earns 
longlasting goodwill in many instances the idea for a book 
originates with them then a corporate sponsor is sought 
it was this curiosity that brought the benjamins to china where 
says roy benjamin they want desperately to read about our way of 
life our historic lore our literature 
he was surprised in china he says to find you couldnt give a 
more appreciated gift than gone with the wind or other american 
classics and biographies essays humor and even selfhelp and 
howto books 
the benjamins say they have two other hot possibilities for 
sponsors distribution of largetype books to the legally blind 
and lowcost pocketsize paperbacks such as illustrated classics 
to combat illiteracy

if accidents are the barometer there is no 
doubt that air travel is safer today than a decade ago when 
congress deregulated the industry but aviation safety experts say 
those statistics dont tell the whole story 
concerns persist about the governments ability to keep airlines 
honest when industry executives in a fiercely competitive 
environment must face the twin challenges of safety and the bottom 
line 
the number of fatal accidents is down as are accident rates 
but the safety experts say there are frightening signs of an 
erosion in the safety cushion that air travelers traditionally have 
come to expect 
example 
as continental airlines flight 1713 rolled down a snowcovered 
denver runway last november at the controls was a 26yearold 
pilot who had flown only 36 hours in a commercial jet and it was 
later found had a history of control problems with even smaller 
propeller aircraft 
the mcdonnell douglas dc9 crashed seconds after takeoff 
killing 28 of the 82 people aboard investigators blamed ice on the 
wings and said the young pilots handling of the plane on takeoff 
was a contributing factor 
about the same time boeing co officials warned alhoa airlines 
of dangerous corrosion on the skin of several of the airlines 
oldest boeing 737s and questioned their airworthiness but the 
planes kept flying and the federal aviation administration was 
unaware of boeings concerns 
five months later a 20foot roof section of one of those 
jetliners peeled away at 24000 feet sweeping a flight attendant 
to her death although the plane miraculously landed safely the 
incident cast a shadow on alohas maintenance and inspection 
programs and raised questions about the ability of the faa to 
adequately monitor aircraft maintenance 
last august a federal report warned that controllers at ohare 
international airport in chicago were flirting with catastrophe 
because of manpower shortages high volumes of traffic and poor 
training at the facility that handles traffic in some of the 
countrys most crowded and complex airspace 
the faa launched another investigation only to learn last month 
that controller errors were still increasing the faa ordered a 
reduction in flights in and out of ohare after finding the 
airlines had been exceeding federally imposed traffic curbs 
one needs to be reminded that it is indeed possible to skate 
successfully on thin ice says john enders president of the 
flight safety foundation a private consulting company specializing 
in aviation safety matters but it is much more desirable to 
skate on thick ice 
we only know when the ice is too thin when someone breaks 
through he adds 
the airlines reject suggestions that air travel has become any 
less safe during the decade of deregulation 
a report earlier this year by a presidential commission agreed 
deregulation has not in itself made the industry less safe 
declared the presidents aviation safety commission it said 
accident statistics based on rates before and after deregulation 
showed accidents involving commercial jet aircraft down 55 percent 
fatal accidents down 51 percnet and passenger fatalities down 45 
percent 
john lauber a member of the national transportation safety 
board says there is no hard data to show that airlines are 
cutting corners on safety or that air travel has become less safe 
he contends that one of the problems is that there is no 
safety indicator that can be relied upon to say one way or the 
other nevertheless he adds to say there is no evidence that 
deregulation has affected safety doesnt mean we should get 
complacent about it 
i think we clearly have a safer aviation system today than we 
did 10 years ago says jim burnett another ntsb member and its 
former chairman 
but both burnett and lauber whose agency investigates aviation 
accidents suggest there are areas of concern the continuing 
growth in air traffic often concentrated near busy hub 
airports continuing shortages of fully qualified air traffic 
controllers too few pilots to meet the demand a general reduction 
in pilot experience even at large airlines and a shortage of 
federal inspectors to make sure air safety regulations are followed 
system safety is risk management and the question is how well 
are we managing risks in the system says lauber 
nevertheless flying remains one of the safest ways to travel 
and the us aviation industry has achieved a safety record that 
continues to improve according to a study of air safety under 
deregulation by congress office of technology assessment 
that study also expressed doubt that all airlines always treat 
safety issues as a top priority while a successful airline might 
focus more attention on safety the same priority might not be 
evident at a financial strapped airline that must choose between 
discretionary maintenance spending or buying an additional slot at 
a busy airport the report said 
it also raised concern about the dwindling experience level of 
pilots today there are many more pilots with little or no jet 
flying experience being hired by major airlines and commuter 
airlines which last year carried nearly 32 million passengers 
at the same time according to air safety and industry experts 
airlines are requiring pilots to fly longer hours discretionary 
maintenance is postponed longer than in the past to keep planes in 
service and many airlines have cut back on engineering safety and 
weather departments to save money 
increasingly airlines flying abroad are relying on foreign 
maintenance facilities which according to some faa officials are 
more difficult for the us agency to monitor and while modern jet 
engines are exceedingly reliable the increased use oftwinengine 
aircraft for transatlantic flights instead of three or 
fourengine jets puts new pressures on maintenance 
it rests in the hands of the faa to ensure that airlines adhere 
to federal safety requirements both in maintenance and operational 
procedures 
but the congressional study as well as others have raised 
questions about whether the faa is up to the task faced with 
budget pressures the faa has been scrambling vainly to catch up 
with the industry concluded the report by the office of 
technology assessment earlier this year 
rep james oberstar dminn chairman of a house investigations 
subcommittee says the faa simply was unprepared they had no 
idea what deregulation was going to do to the economics of the 
airline business and of the response that would be required

at the heart of the faas ability to monitor the airlines is its 
team of aviation inspectors but at a time when the airlines were 
expanding rapidly in the early l980s the faa was cutting its cadre 
of inspectors 
in 1983 when large airlines operated a fleet of 2475 aircraft 
the faa had 507 inspectors assigned to jetoperating airlines 85 
fewer than three years before while its inspector force has 
increased to 872 the the number of aircraft operated by these 
airlines has jumped to nearly 3500 and the agency continues its 
struggle to catch up 
last month the general accounting office the investigative arm 
of congress reported that because of attrition the faa loses 
seven air carrier inspectors for every 10 it hires 
the faa also has yet to get enough fully trained air traffic 
controllers into some of its busiest facilities such as chicago 
new york atlanta and los angeles where controllers still work 
more overtime than both the faa and the controllers want 
the airlines meanwhile contend that their interest in safety 
goes unchallenged and cite statistics showing a nearly tripling of 
airline maintenance budgets during the past 10 years 
we are not cutting corners we would never cut in the areas of 
safety i dont really believe anybody in the industry is 
cutting corners says hollis harris president of delta air lines 
the faa has conducted a series of special indepth 
inspections of major air carriers in recent years and levied fines 
including one against eastern air lines for a once unheard of 95 
million for broad recordkeeping and maintenance violations 
but says john nance a former pilot and author who has been a 
vocal critic of both the faa and the airlines on safety matters 
if the faa had been able to do an adequate job of continuous 
monitoring and surveillance of eastern the violations would 
have been caught without a special inspection

adrian lecornu leaned against the stump 
of a 400yearold spruce and surveyed the remains of the ancient 
forest on a hill near his indian village 
where trees 6 feet in diameter once towered over the mossy 
forest floor acres of stumps and rotten wood now litter the 
scarred earth 
they say war is hell said lecornu hydaburgs city 
administrator well logging is not a pretty sight either 
timbercutting is nothing new here a 700mile web of logging 
roads connects this haida indian village to the rest of alaskas 
prince of wales island 
but lecornu and others who depend on the regions dark forests 
and cool waters for subsistence hunting and fishing find it ironic 
that the regions most aggressive and destructive logging is being 
done by the natives themselves what is worse lecornu said is 
that it may be too late to do anything about it 
national environmental groups have been crying foul for years 
over logging in the oldgrowth spruce and hemlock forests of 
alaskas 16 millionacre tongass national forest several islands 
to the north of prince of wales 
but little is heard about native logging even though cutting on 
native land in alaskas panhandle has outstripped the tongass 
harvest in each of the last two years this year an estimated 
15000 acres of native lands will be cut compared to about 9000 
acres in the tongass 
leaders of the native corporations say the logging has boosted 
the regions economy and caused little environmental damage 
claims disputed by other natives who say the logging provides 
temporary profit and longterm harm 
commercial fishermen environmentalists and state wildlife 
biologists also voice concerns but say little can be done to 
control native logging the federal regulations that govern cutting 
in the tongass do not apply to native corporations the panhandles 
major private landowners 
clearcutting which fells all trees in an area is the norm 
here but tongass clearcuts are limited to 100 acres while cuts on 
native lands may stretch across thousands 
in addition native loggers are not required to leave buffer 
strips of trees along salmon streams or to consider the effects of 
logging on wildlife habitat they may also cut on steeper slopes 
increasing the chance for streamclogging silt and landslides said 
jack gustafson a biologist for the alaska department of fish and 
game 
weve got a new kind of logging gustafson said a lot of 
the longterm effects are not fully known we have concerns but we 
dont have the authority to change it 
the stage was set for native logging with passage of the 1971 
alaska native claims settlement act which awarded natives 44 
million acres and nearly 1 billion to be managed by 12 regional 
corporations and 200 village corporations 
logging began eight years ago as southeastern alaskas one 
regional corporation and 12 village corporations started receiving 
the 470000 acres promised them in the act 
even corporate leaders were surprised at how fast the trees fell 
when the timber export market declined sharply in 1981 some 
corporations had to log heavily to pay off startup loans when 
timber prices rose in 1986 logging intensified as corporations 
converted assets to cash perhaps the strongest incentive to keep 
cutting down trees was the 1986 tax reform act under which native 
corporations could sell their operating losses to profitable 
corporations in need of tax writeoffs 
the results of accelerated logging are plain to see 
twenty miles south of hydaburg a 30000acre island is being 
shaved of oldgrowth timber near the chichagof island village of 
hoonah hillsides look like theyve been nuked according to 
ernestine hanlon the angry villager said logging had destroyed her 
favorite spot for collecting the spruce roots she weaves into 
baskets 
the rush to cut has overwhelmed gustafson and other state 
inspectors who enforce the states forest practices act and try to 
protect salmon streams 
this summer in one of the most serious violations klukwan 
forest products inc was fined 7500 and ordered to restore a 
500foot stretch of a salmon stream it had buried under tons of 
logs branches and organic debris 
besides noting the potential damage to salmon runs by such 
careless logging practices environmentalists also say clearcuts 
and the young sameheight forests that follow threaten sitka 
blacktailed deer which depend on old trees for protection from 
deep snow 
but the environmentalists have not pressed their concerns 
concentrating instead on the tongass national forest 
you have to pick your fights said bart koehler director of 
the southeast alaska conservation council there is a better 
chance of changing things on public lands than on native lands 
thats as it should be said richard harris a vice president 
for sealaska corp the regional native corporation and 
southeastern alaskas biggest private landowner private land 
should not be subject to the same constraints as public land he 
said like any corporation sealaska has a responsibility to its 
shareholders to maximize profits he said 
not surprisingly attitudes toward logging in native villages 
depend at least partly on how much the villages have gained from 
logging 
complaints are few in the prince of wales island village of 
kasaan whose corporation sold its timber rights invested the 
money and now pays an annual 10000 dividend to each of its 119 
shareholders 
in hydaburg the rewards have been smaller and the opposition 
to logging has been greater when land was being handed out the 
villages haida corp received mostly scrub timber and is just now 
struggling out of bankruptcy court 
meanwhile sealaska and klukwan corp a village corporation 
based 300 miles to the north are heavily cutting more productive 
lands near hydaburg 
when sealaska sought to cut trees above hydaburgs reservoir 
the city council forced one delay after another worried that 
logging would silt up streams and foul its water supply sealaska 
had planned to cut up to 700 acres in the watershed it stopped in 
may 1987 after cutting only 100 acres 
sealaska probably will never touch the watershed again too 
much trouble said hydaburg mayor robert sanderson 
recent efforts to regulate native logging have concentrated on 
putting more teeth in the states forest practices act this 
summer gov steve cowper appointed a panel to review the law 
but any changes will come too late to affect most native land 
several village corporations have exhausted their commercial timber 
stands and the others are expected to run out of trees within 
three years sealaska can log for eight to 10 more years 
the forest will take 100 years to grow back to commercial size 
at least 300 years to become the oldgrowth forest that 
environmentalists are now trying to protect 
how do you manage the land now asked mayor sanderson 
its already stripped all you can do now is let the trees grow 
back

its snake blood not snake oil but the 
bidor snake shop says it cures the same aches arthritis asthma 
acne and mysterious maladies of a sexual nature 
the proprietor loi chee long sells the blood of cobras and 
other poisonous snakes to those who find his shop in this jungle 
town 90 miles north of kuala lumpur and can pay the fee of up to 
120 
customers buy the snake then loi kills it and drains the blood 
mixing it with brandy for taste and wallop 
most of his customers are from malaysia and singapore but some 
tourists drop in from korea japan taiwan and hong kong and there 
is the occasional western curiosityseeker 
the white man comes but i think it is all too disgusting to 
him said loi 27 he inquires about the whole thing with great 
enthusiasm but when we ask him to have a drink he says not for 
me thanks 
as he spoke loi had a firm grip on the neck of a cobra longer 
than he was loi is about 5 ft tall and the reptiles tail 
thrashed the ground 
the commotion continued while he explained calmly that people 
drink snake blood because it can cure rheumatism body aches and 
skin diseases improve the eyesight and increase your sexual 
prowess among other things 
he said a snakes venom is in its mouth and the blood contains 
no poison 
loi explained the procedure like a surgeon conducting class 
i hold the snake by the neck find the main blood vessels on 
the underside slit them with a sharp knife and gather the blood in 
the glass 
pieces of the snakes gallbladder are thrown in and an equal 
amount of brandy is added the brandy is to give the whole thing a 
kick as you drink it beer and stout wont give that 
this drinking cobra blood is nothing new the chinese have 
been doing it for years 
with his free hand he plucked a snake from another cage 
am i scared he said no i have been catching snakes 
since i left school at the age of 16 
at first i used to creep quietly behind the snake hold its 
head with a stick and grab it by the neck and dump it into a cage 
now i just grab it by the neck after so many years it would be 
amateurish to use the stick 
he has never been bitten loi said because he is a professional 
snake catcher whose rule is your hand grabbing the neck has to 
be quicker than the cobras head to bite you 
other professional catchers in bidor include wai kwan yang his 
partner in the shop and lim ah ha who was listening to the 
interview loi said 
they take no antidote with them on hunting forays because the 
doctor says it is illegal for us to carry such medicine around 
he said but we carry a small knife if i am bitten i would cut 
the area drain the blood and rush to a doctor 
we catch only poisonous snakes like the cobra black cobra 
king cobra and pit vipers because only their blood will have the 
proper effect 
about 30 to 50 people come to the shop for blood every month

the popularity of occultism 
including devil worship is growing among west germanys young and 
a newspaper said some even engage in the practices during breaks at 
school 
parents public officials and church leaders say 10000 
teenagers may be involved in occult practices ranging from seances 
to black sabbaths in which animals are sacrificed at cemeteries 
a frontpage report oct 8 in the influential frankfurter 
allgemeine zeitung carried the headline the occult is spreading 
in our schools 
it cited instances of pupils using breaks between classes for 
occult practices and said participants withdraw from other 
teenagers their thoughts constantly revolve around the puzzling 
world of the spirits 
in september a meeting of the national parents council issued 
a statement declaring the rise of occultism and magic practices 
among pupils indicates spiritual and psychological deficits in 
our society 
hansjoachim neuser spokesman for the northrhine westphalia 
state culture ministry said teens are using occult beliefs as 
they would a drug this is more than just an individual case or a 
passing fad 
he said officials the number of reports from schools was 
growing especially from religion teachers 
often the pupils themselves get scared they might have gone 
too far in their occult practices and turn to their religion 
teachers for help neuser told the associated press by telephone 
religion is a subject in most west german public schools 
occult practices among teenagers range from experimentation 
with pendulums or glasses to devilworship ceremonies calling for 
animal sacrifice neuser said 
the first practice mentioned involves calling on spirits to 
guide a dangling pendulum to letters or words placed beneath it in 
other ceremonies spirits of deceased friends or relatives are 
asked to move a glass coins or a table in response to certain 
questions 
among factors blamed for the turn to occultism are youth 
unemployment broken homes and pessimism about the future 
two teenage members of a group practicing devil worship were 
convicted of murder by a muenster regional court in october 1987 
they slit the wrists and throat of another cult member in what was 
to be a group suicide 
youngsters killed a cat during a black sabbath at a dortmund 
cemetery and ripped out its intestines the hamburg newspaper welt 
am sonntag reported on feb 21 
spiegel the weekly news magazine published a photograph oct 
12 1987 of a note it said was written by a ninthgrader in 
lahnstein and intercepted by her teacher 
i asked lucifer yesterday who is possessed by the devil it 
said and listed the names of 11 other pupils the magazine 
reported 
the rev walter schmidt of the lutheran central organization for 
world views in stuttgart said at least 10000 teenagers are 
involved to one degree or another in various occult practices 
a lutheran pastor in stuttgart the rev hansjuergen ruppert 
said teenage adherence to traditional religions is declining in 
concert with occultisms rise 
teens are in increasing numbers turning away from traditional 
religion and turning to the occult as a replacement he said 
we have to increase contact with them through church youth groups 
and by strengthening their bonds to religion the danger is that 
these children may continue drifting away from society 
neuser expressed fear of a deeper effect 
this involvement happens while the youngster is still forming 
a sense of values and responsibility if distant powers are 
supposedly controlling his behavior he never has to take 
responsibility for his actions

old dogs in the investment game are trying to 
teach themselves some new tricks to use in the fastapproaching 
season for yearend tax planning 
since tax reform took full effect a lot of the traditional 
rules in this annual exercise no longer apply 
and with gains or losses from investments now treated as just 
another form of income eligible for no special tax break there 
is much less reason to worry about whether a given profit or loss 
is longterm or shortterm held for one year or less 
but experts on this subject say there is still a lot that 
investors can do to try to minimize the taxes they will owe for 
1988 
one relatively simple example if you have gains from 
investments sold earlier in the year and are sitting with a paper 
loss on a security you still own you might consider selling that 
security to reduce or offset the tax you might otherwise have to 
pay on your profitable transactions 
two major unknown factors go into any calculation involving 
yearend tax maneuvers this time around 
first of all there is the distinct possibility that income tax 
rates may be raised in 1989 and beyond 
that would constitute an argument for reversing the usual 
process and taking gains this year while deferring losses into the 
future when they would have greater value as a deduction 
at the same time proposals have been made to restore the tax 
break for longterm capital gains which before tax reform were 60 
percent exempt from federal taxes 
that possibility though by no means a certainty stands as a 
point in favor of holding on to longterm investments that show a 
profit until you can see what a new administration and a new 
congress are likely to do 
on this point longterm deserves special emphasis while 
there may be some sentiment in washington for stimulating longterm 
savings and investment there is very little for encouraging 
shortterm trading 
along with these imponderables there are still some 
hardandfast rules to go by losses that exceed gains for 
instance are deductible only up to a limit of 3000 anything 
more than that has to be carried forward to future years 
if you sell a security to realize a loss you cannot buy the 
same security within 30 days before or after the sale without 
creating a wash sale that invalidates the deduction for the 
loss 
there remain several strategies for freezing gains on 
profitable investments so that the tax liability can be postponed 
into 1989 and any broker will be more than pleased to explain them 
these techniques do bring transaction costs which should be 
weighed carefully to determine whether the expense is worth the tax 
saving 
taxpayers who use substantial amounts of borrowed money to 
finance their investment activities also need to consider new rules 
covering the deduction for investment interest 
suppose you owned two stocks financed with borrowed money one 
of them was a loser and you dumped it not long ago you are 
hanging onto the other which has risen sharply in price 
to make sure you can get a deduction for all the interest you 
pay this year on the borrowed money it might prove advantageous to 
sell your winner before yearend so that your investment income is 
pretty much in line with you interest expense 
you can buy the stock back immediately if you wish since the 
wash sale rule does not apply to gains

in at least one case this year that approach has caused a major 
rift between unions headquarters and local teamster leaders 
teamster officials in connecticut wanted the union to support 
democratic attoney general joseph i liebermans bid to unseat 
veteran republican sen lowell p weicker jr national union 
leaders preferred weicker 
you defeat the system and the whole purpose of a political 
action committee if you work against a guy like weicker who has a 
100 percent prolabor voting record sweeney said 
sweeney said officials in his office also try to dissuade 
teamster locals from going after a very conservative republican 
where you cant beat him 
he cited veteran conservative republican reps james h quillen 
of tennessee the ranking minority member on the house rules 
committee and donald e lukens of ohio both have large teamster 
locals in their districts 
and both according to sweeney were instrumental in getting 
signatures from other pillars of the far right such as rep 
newt gingrich rga on letters from 264 house members condemning 
a justice department suit to take over the union under the 
racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act 
the suit has become an issue in some house campaigns 
the campaign manager for incumbent rep doug bereuter rneb 
suggested that democratic opponent warren jones return a 5000 
drive contribution the teamsters gave jones another 5000 
thomas h fetzer jr the gop opponent of rep david e price 
dnc challenged prices acceptance of 10000 from the teamsters 
in light of the suit 
rep james mcclure clark dnc was accused of accepting 
tainted teamster money by his opponent republican charles h 
taylor 
clark responded that he has yet to hear taylor or any republican 
suggest that president reagan return any contributions from the 
teamsters in the unions endorsement of him in 1980 and 1984 
sweeney said the attacks have stopped since the teamsters 
complained to sen ted stevens ralaska and stevens talked to 
former republican sen paul laxalt of nevada now an adviser to the 
bush campaign 
we think it was organized they deny it he said 
rep beryl anthony of arkansas chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee sent a letter to colleagues 
suggesting they neutralize the attacks by pointing to the 
teamsters 189275 in contributions to republicans 
among them according to the fec are 8000 to sen phil gramm 
of texas 5000 to house republican leader robert michel of 
illinois and 1000 to house republican whip trent lott who is 
seeking the senate seat of retiring mississippi democrat john 
stennis

pessimism about opecs ability to limit 
production and stabilize prices has again gripped the oil futures 
market sending prices sharply lower in wildly volatile trading 
the november contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude plunged 80 cents thursday to close at 1460 a 
42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
on wednesday the november contract soared 79 cents following a 
60cent drop the previous session during the course of thursdays 
trading the contract traded as low as 1425 and as high as 1530 
analysts said the extreme volatility has reflected the waning 
and waxing of traders hopes that the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries can agree to cap its runaway overproduction and 
stabilize the price of oil 
the market lived and died completely on rumors of whether this 
opec agreement will come together said peter beutel an 
assistant director at elders futures inc 
opecs strategy and pricing committees were meeting thursday in 
madrid spain but the session had not begun by the close of 
trading on the mercantile exchange 
rumors that iran would refuse to join its fellow opec members in 
an agreement sparked the heavy selling beutel said 
overproduction by the 13nation cartel sent the price of oil 
skidding below the 1230abarrel mark recently but prices 
recovered somewhat as thursdays session drew near 
estimates of the cartels daily output have ranged as high as 22 
million barrels of oil members of the sixnation gulf cooperation 
council several of whom are opec members have proposed an overall 
ceiling of 185 million to 19 million barrels a day 
analysts expect trading to remain volatile even after the 
conclusion of the madrid conference because opec has scheduled a 
full ministerial meeting on nov 21 
beutel called the market confused adding were just waiting 
to find out what opecs going to do 
refined products traded on the mercantile exchange were mixed 
thursday the november contract for home heating oil fell 079 cent 
to close at 4306 cents a gallon however the november contract 
for wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 029 cent to settle at 4935

drexel burnham lambert inc has convinced a 
federal appeals court to at least consider its request to 
disqualify a lowercourt judge presiding over the massive 
civilfraud case against the wall street giant 
a onepage written order issued thursday by the 2nd circuit 
court of appeals temporarily halted all proceedings in the 
securities and exchange commissions suit against drexel while 
weighing the request 
the appellate order also halted proceedings in 13 related 
insidertrading civil suits presided over by the us district 
judge in question milton pollack 
the order came three days after pollack an 82yearold jurist 
known for tough rulings against whitecollar defendants in 
securitiesfraud cases angrily rejected defense entreaties to quit 
the case on grounds of a potential conflict of interest calling 
such requests nonsense 
defense attorneys immediately appealed his rejection by filing 
an unusual petition requesting the higher court to intervene 
the appellate order said a stay of all proceedings in district 
court is granted pending determination of the petition 
the immediate effect was to delay a hearing pollack had 
scheduled on pretrial factgathering by defense attorneys and the 
sec which accused drexel and four key employees of extensive 
securities fraud in a 184page civil suit filed last month 
the order also delayed the expected completion of a partial 
settlement in some of the related civil suits 
it gave the sec and attorneys for others that have sued drexel 
until oct 28 to respond to the defense request for pollack to step 
aside 
drexel spokesman steven anreder declined to comment on the 
appellate order 
the washington office of barry goldsmith the sec deputy 
litigation chief in charge of the case said he was out of town and 
unavailable for comment 
lawyers familiar with the case said the order represented at 
least a recognition by the appellate court that drexels arguments 
requesting pollack to quit the case should be taken seriously 
attorneys for drexel and the other defendants have alleged that 
pollack cannot rule fairly in the case because his wife moselle 
stands to gain about 30 million from her sale of stock in palais 
royal inc a houstonbased concern going private in a transaction 
drexel is helping finance 
although the alleged conflict would appear to make pollack 
biased in drexels favor the defense has argued that the firm is 
entitled to a judge who can rule with absolute impartiality 
pollack ridiculed the defense argument saying his wife had no 
relationship with drexel he called the argument a timewasting 
ploy devised by the firms attorneys to frustrate the sec case 
on sept 7 the sec accused drexel and the other defendants of 
scheming with nowimprisoned insider trader ivan boesky to break a 
litany of securitiesfraud laws the defendants have denied the 
accusations 
the manhattan us attorneys office which also has been 
investigating drexels relationship with boesky since he turned 
states evidence almost two years ago is widely expected to seek 
indictments of the firm soon 
earlier this week it notified drexel in a socalled target 
letter that a grand jury was considering whether to charge the 
firm with securities fraud under the racketeering influenced and 
corrupt practices law which carries devastating penalties drexel 
has repeatedly denied wrongdoing 
the justice department confirmed thursday that it would meet 
soon with attorneys for drexel to discuss these possible charges 
the meeting expected to take place next monday gives drexel an 
opportunity to persuade federal prosecutors that a racketeering 
indictment which alleges a pattern of criminal activity and 
originally was designed to battle gangsters drug dealers and 
pimps is unwarranted and unfair 
a pioneer in the socalled junkbond highyield securities 
market drexel is one of the biggest and most profitable wall 
street firms with more than 10000 employees capital of about 
22 billion and assets of more than 30 billion

ramada inc intent on focusing on its profitable 
gambling operations has unveiled a restructuring plan that 
includes selling off its hotel and restaurant businesses and 
distributing at least 278 million to shareholders 
the plan announced thursday was devised partly in response to 
a recent buyout offer from chicagos pritzker family which 
controls 72 percent of ramadas outstanding stock and is the 
companys largest shareholder 
last month ramada rejected as inadequate the pritzkers 368 
million buyout offer shortly thereafter the company said it was 
reviewing various options to boost shareholder value including the 
sale of assets and a managementled buyout 
joe cole ramadas vice president for corporate communications 
said the pritzkers remain potential buyers for the companys hotel 
business ramada owns operates and franchises 800 hotels under the 
ramada and rodeway names 
under terms of the restructuring plan approved by the ramada 
board cole said stockholders would be paid at least 7 a share in 
cash depending on the successful sale of the restaurant and hotel 
businesses 
richard snell ramada chairman and chief executive officer said 
in a statement that the restructuring will allow the company to 
optimize its investment in the hotel business in the context of 
recent prices paid for hotel operations sold as ongoing 
businesses a number of major hotel properties have sold for top 
dollar recently 
cole noted that ramadas hotel business has not been 
performing well lately it has not been producing the return on 
equity that we expected from it 
without the hotel and restaurant operations ramada said it 
expects its overall performance to significantly improve 
ramada which also owns marie callenders restaurants will 
retain its gambling businesses which include tropworld in atlantic 
city nj and tropicana in las vegas 
while the restructuring should be completed in the first half of 
1989 cole noted that ramada could not offer any guarantees he 
also said there are no assurances of the exact amount of cash 
shareholders would receive 
the company retained the option of paying at least part of the 
money in notes in addition to selling off assets cole said ramada 
would have to refinance or renegotiate a substantial portion of the 
companys debt 
thursdays move is the latest in a string of attempts to improve 
the phoenixbased hospitality companys financial position 
a deal to sell its international hotels to baa plc of london 
fell through last month in july ramada sold its 60 million 
ramada express hotel and casino in laughlin nev to phoenixbased 
hampm station inc just one month after it opened the 406room 
facility

texas billionaire h ross perot has been 
barred from reaping profits in deals that compete with electronic 
data systems the dataprocessing company he founded and once 
headed a judge has ruled 
but thursdays ruling in the circuit court of suburban fairfax 
va stipulated that perot can compete with eds in ventures that 
make no profits 
after a 3day hearing judge william g plummer ordered perot 
and his new computer services company perot systems corp to 
immediately stop soliciting negotiating for entering into or 
performing any contract or other business relationship that 
contemplates or calls for any profitable return to the defendants 
at any point in time 
profitable ventures would violate an agreement perot signed in 
late 1986 not to compete with eds until late 1989 
plummer said however that perot systems could sign contracts 
for work as long as they would not produce any profit even after 
perots agreement with eds expried 
the injunction is in force pending a hearing next april on edss 
lawsuit that charges perot violated the competition agreement 
perot seemed nonplussed by the ruling and noted that he could 
still go headtohead with eds and hire eds employees 
id like to keep doing business perot said 
but eds claimed victory eds spokeswoman penny pasquesi said 
eds won the game and now were trying to bicker over the score 
perot thinks its a tie and we think we won 
she said the judges ruling did not address the hiring issue 
although it came up during the hearing 
perot founded eds in 1962 and sold it to general motors corp in 
1984 the relationship between perot and gm soon soured and perot 
and three other top eds executives left the firm in december 1986 
when gm agreed to pay them about 850 million perot also stepped 
down from gms board in a bitter parting with the automaker 
eds in its lawsuit claimed perot had violated an agreement to 
refrain from competing with the dataprocessing company for at 
least three years after the split 
perot has filed a countersuit in us district court in dallas 
seeking an injunction to prevent eds and gm from interfering in the 
business activities of perot systems 
a day after forming perot systems this spring the dallas 
businessman revealed its first job was a nobid 500000 contract 
to automate the us postal service perot said the contract would 
be a nonprofit agreement until the expiration date of his 
agreement with gm 
the general administration services then canceled the contract 
after eds other competitors and washington lawmakers complained 
that the perot systems contract unfairly favored perot 
the us circuit court of appeals for the federal circuit 
overturned the gsas ruling but the deal remains suspended under 
an action by postmaster general anthony frank a decision has not 
been made on whether the service will resume its dealings with 
perots company 
perot meanwhile also is competing with eds for the texas 
medicaid contract that eds has held since 1976 and helped the 
company establish its reputation nationwide 
in testimony wednesday perot said he informed eds executives in

time incs decision to pay an initial 185 
million for halfinterest in whittle communications lp should prove 
rewarding to both media companies analysts say 
it may also prove personally rewarding to whittle founder 
christopher whittle who said he was selling half of his 80 
million stake in the feisty media partnership to time as part of 
the deal 
analysts said the deal announced thursday was a lowrisk way 
for time to share in the rewards of association with a concern that 
has made its reputation by developing innovative ways for 
advertisers to reach select audiences 
at the same time they said it would give whittle access to the 
resources and experience of one the nations biggest communications 
companies 
it looks like a good deal for both sides said john reidy 
media analyst for the investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc 
under terms of the deal approved by the time board but still 
subject to negotiation of a definitive agreement time would make 
unspecified additional payments tied to whittles earnings growth 
over the next five years 
time also can boost its stake in whittle to 80 percent in 1993 
if certain earnings targets were met 
whittle was one of four college students who started whittle 
communications in 1970 another major owner of the privately held 
concern is associated newspaper holdings plc a british company 
whittle said he would receive about 40 million of times 
initial payment in return for half of his 22 percent stake in 
whittle communications 
he declined to say how large associateds stake was and the 
british company was closed for the day when the deal was announced 
reginald k brack head of times magazine group said whittle 
communications earnings have grown at a 20 percent annual rate 
over the past five years you have to be impressed with whittles 
track record he said 
whittle said his company decided about four months ago to seek 
out a partner who could help it grow even more rapidly 
the company publishes magazines targeted for special audiences 
such as students people in doctors waiting rooms and parents as 
well as posters with ads that are placed at welltraveled locations 
such as school halls 
whittle communications posted revenue of about 152 million this 
year and projected operating income for 1989 at about 35 million 
on revenue of 185 million 
whittle said times offer was not the highest but was selected 
because time had a breadth of experience and resources and would 
give whittle managers autonomy as they develop more magazines 
posters book and video vehicles 
whittle who is chairman of whittle communications and his team 
of managers will continue operating the business after the deal is 
concluded 
the deal was tinged with irony because whittle has been making 
inroads in the magazine field by making fun of the magazine 
establishment 
that was evident in the recent whittle launch of special 
reports a sixmagazine package that was designed specifically for 
doctors waiting rooms 
whittle sold 80 million in advertising for the magazines by 
offering companies exclusivity in their product categories and 
asking doctors who get the magazines to have no more than two other 
magazines in their waiting rooms 
the latter request to doctors infuriated magazine publishers 
including some at times publications 
but times brack downplayed the significance of the dispute 
saying that like any marriage were not going to agree on 
everything 
time has taken a stake in other magazine ventures it is a 
partner for instance in the concern that publishes mccalls and 
working woman magazines 
analysts said some recent costly failures of startup magazines 
have made time more leery of trying to start magazines from scratch 
but brack said time is taking both approaches saying it has 
some projects of its own that are nearing launch but refused to 
discuss them

the senate ended a century of hesitation by 
giving its approval to a treaty giving american artists and writers 
copyright protection in 76 nations around the world 
the senates voicevote approval of the treaty thursday opens 
the way for the united states to become the 77th member of the 
berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works 
president reagan will take the final step by depositing the us 
ratification documents with the convention 
under the treaty artists and writers from the conventions 
other member nations will enjoy copyright protection in the united 
states 
the house and senate earlier had approved implementing 
legislation making minor adjustments to us copyright law to

protected and how long the protection lasts 
the pact bars member nations from discriminating against 
protected works from other member states 
the implementing bill recognizes architectural plans as a

rjr nabisco inc managers dropped a 17 billion 
bombshell by disclosing they are considering a buyout of the food 
and tobacco company at that price which would make it the largest 
takeover in history 
analysts speculated the move was designed to dissuade unwanted 
suitors from approaching nabisco maker of winston and camel 
cigarettes oreo cookies and ritz crackers 
thursdays announcement that a group led by president and chief 
executive f ross johnson is mulling a 75ashare offer to take 
nabisco private sent the companys stock soaring in heavy trading 
on the new york stock exchange nabisco jumped 2137 a share to 
7725 and observers predicted the price will go higher 
lawrence adelman an analyst at drexel burnham lambert inc 
priced nabisco at between 90 and 100 a share and said johnson 
is trying to steal the company at 75 a share 
analysts viewed the move as a preemptive strike designed to 
ward off other unwanted bidders at a time when the takeover 
spotlight is shining brightly on major food companies 
on monday philip morris cos inc offered more than 11 billion 
for processed foods manufacturer kraft inc the following day 
pillsbury co rejected a 523 billion tender offer launched by 
britains grand metropolitan plc 
neal kaplan an analyst with interstatejohnson lane in 
charlotte nc said nabisco may be recognizing that others may 
be looking at them 
at the same time he said nabisco executives see philip morris 
paying 20odd times earnings for kraft and say we can spend all 
our money and buy ourselves which we know is good 
he viewed the buyout proposal as a continuation of nabiscos 
strategy of buying back its own stock on july 31 the company had 
225 million shares outstanding down from 247 million at the end of 
1987 at 75 a share the buyout proposal currently is worth about 
1688 billion 
nabisco said johnson and edward a horrigan jr chief executive 
of the companys tobacco business had notified the company they 
intend to seek to develop with a financial partner a proposal 
to acquire rjr nabisco in a leveraged buyout merger transaction 
shearson lehman hutton inc which is advising the management 
group would provide equity and financing for the deal 
the company said late thursday the offer will be reviewed by a 
special committee of outside directors led by chairman charles e 
hugel leaving the door open for a bidding war the committee also 
said it will review any other acquisition interest that may be 
presented 
while some analysts suggested a buyout would have to reach at 
least 85 a share to be successful kaplan said a 75 looks like 
a darn good number 
at that level he said the company could pay off new debt 
through revenues a strategy that would be more difficult at a 
higher price 
in a leveraged buyout the buyer borrows the money to buy the 
company then pays off the debt either through company revenue or 
selling off parts of the operation 
todays editions of the wall street journal quoted people 
familiar with the management groups strategy as saying it intends 
to utterly transform the tobaccoandfood conglomerate largely by 
divesting as much of its nontobacco businesses as necessary to pay 
off debt 
like other tobacco companies nabiscos stock has been driven 
lower by worries over cigarette liability suits valuing nabisco 
as a food company and discounting the tobacco operation i arrive 
at a value somewhere between 85 and 90 a share said pavlos 
alexandrakis an analyst with argus research corp in new york 
if the deal were completed it would be the biggest leveraged 
buyout of an american corporation widely surpassing the 61 
billion buyout of beatrice cos by an investment group led by 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co in 1986 
it also would top the biggest corporate acquisition the 134 
billion purchase of gulf corp by chevron corp in 1984 
in the quarter ended sept 30 nabisco said it earned 355 
million on sales of 416 billion compared to 320 million in 
profits and sales of 384 billion in the same quarter last year 
income from tobacco operations was 497 million in the quarter 
on sales of 178 billion while food income accounted for 276 
million on 238 billion in sales 
rjr nabisco was formed when the tobacco company rj reynolds 
industries inc bought nabisco brands inc the food and consumer 
products giant for 49 billion in 1985 today the company ranks 
as the nations 19th largest industrial concern 
johnson came to the conglomerate from nabisco and last year 
shifted the companys headquarters from winstonsalem nc to 
atlanta in a move seen as an attempt to distance the company from 
its tobacco beginnings 
among the companys major products are salem cigarettes lorna 
doone and mallomar cookies chuckles and junior mints candy del 
monte vegetables and milkbone dog biscuits 
nabisco currently is testmarketing a smokeless cigarette 
premier 
in 1987 rjr nabisco had profits of 118 billion on sales of 
1577 billion that level of sales would make rjr nabisco the 
third largest privately held company in the country according to 
forbes magazine behind cargill a commodity trading company and 
safeway stores inc the grocery chain 
in the past few years the company has sold off divisions 
including kentucky fried chicken that did not fit with its 
longrange plans

an unusual twist occurred in the most recent job 
survey by the bureau of labor statistics it could be an 
aberration but if it isnt it is worth watching 
this is it 
the civilian jobless rate fell from 56 percent in august to 54 
percent in september a move that at first glance might suggest the 
economy was overheating 
overheating in this sense generally refers to two factors the 
rate of industrial production and the unemployment rate 
as industrial production reaches capacity it means the least 
productive plants are brought into service thus forcing up costs 
and as the jobless rate falls it means a tighter labor pool 
perhaps leading to wage increases 
this time however the falling jobless rate did not suggest 
upward pressure on wages in fact there has been little 
inflationary pressure from wages all year long but it did scare up 
a ghost that might require equal vigilance 
the situation is described in commissioner janet l norwoods 
statement to the joint economic committee of congress on oct 7 
a large portion of the overall payroll employment increase 
nearly 40 percent was in state and local government reflecting a 
stronger than usual expansion in public school jobs at the 
beginning of the new school year 
in contrast the private sector which grew strongly earlier 
in the year exhibited relatively small gains 
that situation offers what could be good news and bad 
the good news is that no further inflationary pressure was 
placed on the economy by a tightening of labor supplies in the 
private sector the bad news is that government employment which 
can be very expensive may be growing 
further figures are necessary to confirm the september 
experience as a trend but many analysts will be keeping an eye on 
it less than a decade ago you may recall many state and local 
governments were in bad financial shape 
controlling employment always has been one of the most difficult 
tasks of government at all levels in part because it takes 
manpower to cut manpower this is bureaucracy like individuals it 
puts on weight while trying to diet 
the rise still might turn out to be insignificant it could be 
nothing more than a methodological miscue moreover there was some 
very good news in the october report that is less inflationary 
pressure on industry 
that latter conclusion comes from a glance at the employment 
breakdown which shows the private sector had relatively small 
employments gains after growing strongly earlier in the year 
privatesector business employment grew at an average rate of 
only 120000 a month in august and september compared with more 
than 300000 a month during the first seven months of the year 
in short the supply of workers was barely tapped in those two 
months which means that little further inflationary pressure was 
added at the same time workers managed to keep their jobs 
another desirable outcome 
but that big increase in state and local government workers 
could be a source of future problems especially in regard to taxes 
and budgets

the eight oil ministers serving on opecs 
pricing and strategy committees ended a second day of talks without 
comment friday but sources said a third session was planned for 
saturday 
no details of fridays twohour session would be made public 
the sources said 
the committees of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries are trying to come up with the framework for a new 
production control agreement that would end the current oversupply 
of oil and help stabilize prices 
overproduction by opec members has had oil prices swerving in 
recent weeks between 12 and 16 a barrel far below the cartels 
target of 18 
current daily output by the cartel is estimated at close to 21 
million barrels a day substantially above the cartels official 
ceiling of 1506 million barrels a day a total that covers all but 
one of its 13 members 
following fridays session the ministers were each expected to 
meet with their staffs and hold separate bilateral meetings 
according to opec sources who agreed to discuss the session only 
if not identified 
the pricing committee consists of the oil ministers of algeria 
saudi arabia nigeria indonesia and venezuela while the strategy 
committee includes the ministers of iraq iran saudi arabia 
kuwait and venezuela 
opec secretarygeneral subroto told reporters friday that more 
meetings of the two committees were expected before the full opec 
meeting scheduled for nov 21 
subroto also said he did not rule out the possibility of a full 
opec meeting even before next months planned gathering 
before the 90minute meeting late thursday oil ministers of 
nigeria saudi arabia and venezuela all said they would accept a 
new production agreement only if it included iraq 
iraq has refused to be a part of the current production system 
because it was not given a quota equal to iran its persian gulf 
enemy in an eightyear war that was stopped by their ceasefire 
agreement in august 
however iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh said thursday 
that his country would not accept production parity with iraq 
the oil ministers of iran and iraq sat down together thursday 
for the first time in an opec setting since the ceasefire 
the remaining opec members are ecuador gabon libya qatar and 
the united arab emirates

along with airline deregulation has come a 
sometimes puzzling array of fares but industry experts say theres 
a reason to all this madness yield management 
simply put says barbara amster american airlines vice 
president in charge of yield management the objective is 
maximize revenue by flying the most passengers possible at the 
highest fares possible 
the computer driven art of yield management is a new phenomenon 
in the airline industry but one which industry experts say is 
central to an airlines success in the free marketplace 
but travelers paying up to 10 times as much for a seat as the 
passenger next to them think its unfair 
before the government stopped telling airlines how much to 
charge the system was simple a coach seat cost one fare and first 
class another prices were determined by a civil aeronautics board 
formula which was somewhat based on how much the flight cost the 
airline although airlines were allowed to charge more on some 
routes to make up for losses in other markets 
today said ms amster the actual cost of producing the 
product and the fares paid by a customer actually have very little 
to do with one another thats very unfortunate but thats the way 
it is 
as a result it is not unusual for a single flight to have more 
than a dozen different fares depending on the level of discount 
which in turn depends largely on how flexible or inconvenienced 
a traveler is willing to be 
the competing airline has a say as well 
pan american world airways trying to drum up business at dulles 
international airport outside washington offered a 198 roundtrip 
fare to los angeles beginning next month all of its competitors 
have matched the fare but are only making a limited number of 
seats available at that price only enough to keep pan am from 
stealing its customers 
meanwhile an unrestricted fare from washington to los angeles 
still costs either 1100 roundtrip if a traveler wants the luxury 
of flying direct or less than half that 488 on united if flying 
through chicago or denver if the passenger is willing to stop 
over at an intermediary hub airport 
airline pricing has become more like gaming than anything 
else says ms amster if an airline decides to cut fares to 
attract business along a particular route the other carrier is 
likely to match it but not always only if it appears the price 
cuts would result in a substantial loss of business or market share 
the airlines treat a seat as a perishible commodity that 
will be worthless once a plane takes to the air its better to 
fill it with a customer paying 128 roundtrip on a flight from 
washington to charleston than have the seat go empty say the 
yield management experts unless that is you can get someone who 
has to fly right away to pay 390 or somewhere in between with 
only two days notice 
the art of yield management depends on sophisticated computers 
that track how many people are likely to fly a particular route 
who can plan ahead and who cant what the competition has 
available and is charging how much a traveler is willing to pay 
for not flying nonstop instead of through a hub and how much he is 
likely to pay for departing from an airport closer to town instead 
of in the countryside 
what computers have allowed the airlines to do is price seat 
by seat and flight by flight says patricia bailey who as a 
former member of the civil aeronautics board remembers the days 
when the government controlled airline pricing 
the new system has caused some intriguing fares 
a person can fly from washington to chicago using the maximum 
discount for 188 roundtrip but for only 5 more he can continue 
on to green bay wis 
that same trip to chicago can be taken sometime between 1201 
am on a saturday and midnight saturday for 228 roundtrip without 
any restrictions but if some other day is chosen the fare can be 
as high as 635 that is if you fly into chicagos ohare airport 
if you fly into midway airport which is closer to downtown an 
unrestricted ticket is 32 cheaper 
and then there are these fares that have perplexed jay angoff a 
former antitrust lawyer at the federal trade commission 
he said delta told him it would cost 395 to fly from washington 
to denver but only 278 from washington to los angeles with a stop 
in denver he found that it cost 395 to fly twa from st louis to 
los angeles and 305 to fly from st louis to washington but a twa 
flight from washington to los angeles throught st louis was only 
278 when discounted 
the fares even have confused alfred kahn the former cab 
chairman who is widely considered the architect of airline 
deregulation 
he sought the help of his travel agent recenty and found two 
fares for a flight from buffalo to new york city on usair with 
unrestricted travel it costs either 99 or 131 he said but my 
travel agent doesnt understand why there are two

it was 10 days before christmas when harold 
hap pareti discovered the airline worlds version of the 
800pound gorilla was about to land on him 
pareti chairman of presidential airways a fledging carrier 
that had carved a small niche at dulles international airport 
outside washington with hopes of growing larger was about to get 
an education into what competition is really like in a freemarket 
airline industry 
united airlines announced that day in middecember 1985 that 
within months it was putting a major hub at dulles and expanding 
its flights from 15 to 58 a day and eventually to 87 a day 
pareti recalls his dreams being doomed 
presidential 3 years old this month today flies under the 
marketing name of united express and banks its future on feeding 
passengers to uniteds jetliners it remains independently owned 
but there is no doubt that united calls the shots 
paretis roughandtumble experiences provide a unique insight 
into the state of competition in todays deregulated airline 
industry while the government no longer bars an airline from 
flying any route it chooses economic realities often do 
so powerful are the halfdozen major megaairlines that many 
aviation experts believe it would be folly to start a new airline 
today according to a congressional budget office report of the 22 
airlines that began interstate service in the past 10 years only 
five survive no new airline has been launched since l985 
it would be extremely difficult to start something from 
scratch today said pareti who was among those who founded 
people express and later became its president before quitting and 
starting presidential there was a window of opportunity and 
the window closed a few years ago 
and pareti bemoans the development 
i think its bad theres got to be that threat of entry and 
that threat of price competition and i dont think thats the case 
in the airline industry anymore 
united express is not what pareti had dreamed of for 
presidential airways when he and a small group of investors started 
the airline in october l985 they had hopes of building a regional 
airline much as those who in earlier years had started piedmont and 
allegheny later usair by flying where the big boys didnt 
that was the plan recalls pareti in an interview in his 
presidential airways office overlooking the main runway at dulles 
the boeing 737 was paretis choice of a plane and he had leased 
13 of them in late l985 and early 86 the jets flew to such 
cities as indianapolis cincinnati cleveland boston hartford 
even montreal and south to florida always through dulles 
the airline was not yet making money as 1986 began but it was 
on its way he says 
but early that year united began its expansion at dulles new 
york air shifted 10 aircraft from new york to dulles and paretis 
dream began to fall apart 
wherever presidential flew so did united new york air and 
usair which also stepped up services to some of the cities 
targeted by pareti even worse if presidential shifted to a new 
city and proved to be successful it was sure to attract the same 
larger stronger competitors 
dulles which once had been ignored because it was too far in 
the virginia suburbs from downtown washington became the fastest 
growing airport in the country but with the new competition 
presidentials jets flew with too many empty seats 
it was a great dream but the reality was we were losing too 
many bucks a month to realize that dream pareti recalls 
so he began dancing weaving and skipping to survive he 
lowered the profile of presidential replaced its boeing 737s with 
new quieter and smaller british aerospace bae146 jets and bought 
a small commuter for its fleet of propeller planes 
he abandoned ideas of beginning a charter jet service primarily 
to haul military personnel although presidential still has one 
boeing 737 being chartered to the presidential campaign of michael 
dukakis a 6 million midfield terminal at dulles which 
presidential built was put up for sale 
in early 1987 continental airlines became its partner but 
within a year continental which had bought newarkbased people 
express shifted most of its flights to newark leaving 
presidential to founder 
the first weeks of l988 were the low point pareti says 
presidential still was flying as continental express but no longer 
served as a connector twothirds of its seats flew empty and 
presidentials stock which had sold for 5 a share in 1985 
tumbled as low as 37 cents a share 
the airline was losing 22 million a month and if everyone 
had said pay cash on the barrelhead it could have put us 
under he recalls but in january he reached agreement with 
united and began flying as united express in february 
presidential airways survives began paretis letter to 
stockholders last april after 88 million in losses the airline 
reported its first quarterly profit 13 million in the second 
quarter of this year 
but the airline is far from what pareti had envisoned its 
relationship with united is cordial but admits geoffrey crowley 
presidentials senior vice president for marketing big brother 
calls the shots 
this summer one of presidentials most profitable routes was 
washington to portland maine it was so profitable that united 
took it over with its own jet service forcing presidential to 
shift to worchester mass a city not nearly as desirable 
but pareti who put 500000 of his own money into starting

a rekindling of higher food costs brought on 
by the drought sent retail prices up 03 percent last month the 
labor department said today nearly balancing the steeper grocery 
prices was the sharpest drop in gasoline costs since february 
the overall consumer price rise was considered moderate and was 
down a notch from the 04 percent rises of july and august the 
good news was that gasoline prices dropped 17 percent the bad 
news was that food prices rose 08 percent 
more significant than any of those numbers for some 384 million 
americans was the effect todays report will have on their social 
security checks beginning in january 
those checks will be up 40 percent or 21 a month for the 
average recipient that will be the second highest boost in the 
last 6 years 
breaking down the new report the department said two components 
food and clothing accounted for 70 percent of the september 
increase 
on grocery store shelves consumers saw fruit and vegetable 
prices climb 45 percent with most of that reflecting residual 
effects from the summers drought 
also rising were beef prices up 11 percent and poultry 
prices up 13 percent poultry is now 237 percent more costly 
than at the beginning of 1988 
the overall gain in food prices was up dramatically from a 05 
percent august advance and was the sharpest since a 09 percent 
july gain which had also been blamed on the drought 
the other bad news clothing costs shot up 22 percent as prices 
for nearly all items of apparel reflected higher prices for fall 
and winter lines 
drivers however found significant good news in todays report 
septembers steep drop in gasoline prices sent pump prices 273 
percent below their peak of march 1981 
home heating oil costs were down 21 percent while the price of 
natural gas and electricity taken together rose 06 percent 
the 03 percent rise in the overall consumer price index if it 
persisted for 12 months would amount to an annual inflation rate 
of 41 percent from january through september prices rose at an 
annual rate of 45 percent up a notch from the 44 percent gain 
posted for all of 1987 
economists expect this moderation in prices to continue for the 
balance of 1988 as falling energy rices should counter further 
droughtdriven food price gains 
indeed last weeks report on wholesale prices for september 
showed that food prices one step short of the retail level shot up 
12 percent while energy prices plummeted 33 percent 
stacy kottman an economist at georgia state university 
predicted that consumer prices for all of 1988 would rise by around 
42 percent even better than the 1987 performance he said 
consumers should continue seeing the benefits of lower world crude 
oil prices caused by the disarray among energyexporting countries 
who have been unable to stick to production quotas 
we believe we will see rather stable consumer prices for the 
near future he said we expect crude oil prices to stay at 
levels below where they were at the beginning of the summer for the 
next several months and that will more than offset the drought 
influences on the food supply 
the september inflation data triggered an automatic 40 percent 
costofliving benefit increase for social security recipients 
that was down slightly form the 42 percent increase paid to the 
elderly blind and disabled americans who receive checks each month 
the government calculates the benefit increase based on the 
change in one portion of the consumer price index wages paid to 
urban workers from july through september of one year to the same 
period of the following year 
benefits have risen automatically with the consumer price index 
since 1975 with the exception of six months in 1983 that were 
skipped to help bail the social security system out of a financial 
crisis 
as for prices last month the labor department offered these 
specifics 
new cars up 06 percent 
used cars up 01 percent 
housing up 03 percent 
medical care up 06 percent 
health care costs have risen 66 percent over the last 12 
months the largest increase for any of the major components of the 
price calculation 
the september gain overall left the consumer price index for 
all urban consumers at 1198 meaning that a hypothetical selection 
of goods and services costing 10 on average from 1982 through 1984 
would have cost 1198 last month 
the index unlike other data in the report is not adjusted for 
periodic predictable seasonal variations 
the index for urban wage earners which is the number used in 
the social security costofliving calculations rose 40 percent 
from the third quarter of 1987 to the same period this year

wheat and soybean futures posted slight early 
gains today on the chicago board of trade while corn prices were 
marginally lower in quiet trading that contrasted sharply with the 
heavy selling of thursday afternoon 
soybean prices which fell as much as 22 cents a bushel on 
thursday steadied this morning in response to the governments 
weekly export sales report showing soybean exports at their highest 
level since summer analysts said 
wheat drew support from confirmation of chinas 
400000metricton purchase of us wheat a sale that had been 
expected for several days 
the corn market although slightly lower apparently was mostly 
recovered from the dismay caused by rumors thursday that the soviet 
union had spurned a shipment of us corn due to the presence of 
aflatoxin a carcinogenic fungus 
us exporter cargill inc denied the rumor but analysts said a 
soviet rejection of a grain shipment was not unlikely 
the russians tend to be fairly picky about the quality of the 
stuff theyre buying and since they are the major buyer in a 
buyers market they can get away with it said walter spilka 
grain analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new york 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 1 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 424 a bushel corn was 
cent to 1 cent lower with december at 285 a bushel oats were 
cent lower to cent higher with december at 254 a bushel 
soybeans were 1 cent lower to 4 cents higher with november at 
786 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on 
the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 40 cent lower to 12 cent higher with december 
at 7437 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent lower to 10 
cent higher with october at 8170 cents a pound live hogs were 05 
cent to 37 cent lower with december at 4180 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 10 cent lower to 45 cent higher with february 
at 4897 cents a pound 
cattle futures settled mostly higher while pork futures were 
mixed on thursday

178 billion to replace part of its aging fleet of commercial 
aircraft 
british airways said it chose boeing over other contenders for 
the orders including the european consortium airbus industrie

airlines existing fleet of 170 planes which already is dominated 
by boeing aircraft 
british airways said the two companies have so far signed a 
memorandum of understanding a purchase contract is to be signed 
once british airways obtains necessary financing the airline said

least nine of these options 
the agreement also covers spare parts and spare engines with 
the minimum value of the deal estimated at 178 billion 
the b737s under order will be powered by the cfm 563 engine 
manufactured by general electric co and frances societe nationale 
detude et de construction de moteurs daviation the airline said 
these jets are due to begin service in the autumn of 1991 
the b767s and 757 will be powered by rollsroyce plc engines 
the new aircraft will replace british airways existing fleet of 
39 bac 111s and will be used mainly for destinations within 
britain and in europe 
the b737s have varying capacities ranging from 105 seats to 145 
seats the bac 111 seats either 75 passengers or 99 passengers 
british airways said the decision to order the boeing jets over 
the airbus a320 was taken on purely commercial grounds 
the boeing package offered greater flexibility compatibility 
with our existing fleet and competitive economics british 
airways said

signals in the wheat market 
wheat prices were nearly unchanged at noon but closed 1 hours 
later as much as 5 cents a bushel below thursdays final prices a

wheat prices looked toppy and were due for a technical 
correction after climbing last week to 438 a bushel for december 
delivery said walter spilka a grain analyst with smith barney

the fact that winter wheat is being planted under good 
conditions is also a negative and the export market despite some 
purchases this morning does not look all that rosy he said 
news that heavy rains had relieved dry rowing conditions in 
northern brazil put pressure on the soybean market spilka said

rumor that the soviet union had spurned a shipment of us corn due 
to the presence of aflatoxin a carcinogenic mold

the nations 384 million social security 
recipients can count on a 4 percent increase in their benefits 
starting next january that will boost the average retired workers 
pension by 21 a month the government announced friday 
the increase the second largest in 6 years will mean the 
typical benefit payment will go from 516 to 537 per month 
offsetting the good news on benefit increases was a 710 hike 
in medicare premiums which will rise to 3190 a month starting in 
january they are deducted directly from the monthly benefits 
the exact size of the increase became official friday when the 
labor department announced the latest change in the consumer price 
index 
since 1975 social security benefits have risen automatically 
each year with the cpi with the exception of six months in 1983 
that were skipped to help bail the system out of a crisis 
the 4 percent increase which will show up in the jan 3 benefit 
checks followed a 42 percent increase which took effect last 
january the two increases were the largest since a 74 percent 
rise in july 1982 back when high inflation rates translated into 
bigger costofliving hikes 
social security officials said the maximum monthly benefit for a 
worker retiring in 1988 at age 65 will rise 61 from 838 to 899 
the 45 million recipients of supplemental security income a 
welfare program for the aged blind or disabled also will get a 4 
percent increase in their benefit payments 
the maximum federal ssi payment will rise by 14 from 354 to 
368 for an individual and by 21 from 532 to 553 for a poor 
couple 
the change in social security benefits is calculated by taking 
increases in the cpi for urban wage earners for the julyseptember 
period compared with the same period in the previous year 
the agency gave the following examples of how the 40 percent 
increase will affect average monthly benefits 
all retired workers up 21 from 516 to 537 
aged couple both getting benefits up 38 from 883 to 921 
widowed mother and two children up 42 from 1070 to 1112 
disabled worker spouse and children up 41 from 902 to 943 
all disabled workers up 20 from 509 to 529 
the social security administration also announced that the 
maximum amount of wages subject to the payroll tax will climb from 
the current 45000 to 48000 in 1989 the wage base the amount 
subject to the tax has gone up every year since 1971 
the latest change means the maximum annual social security tax 
paid by high income workers will rise by 22530 to 360480 
employers pay the same amount each worker pays 
the change in the wage cap will affect about 9 million of the 
130 million workers covered by social security 
the payroll tax rate will remain unchanged at 751 percent 
during 1989 but it will rise to 765 percent on jan 1 1990 the 
final increase planned at this time those changes were adopted by 
congress in 1983 as part of a bipartisan plan to bail the system 
out of recurrent financing problems 
tax rates for the selfemployed remain unchanged at 1302 
percent for 1989 but the amount subject to tax will rise to 
48000 
social security commissioner dorcas r hardy said the latest 
benefit increase ensures that americas elderly and disabled are 
able to maintain their purchasing power as the price of necessary 
goods and services rise 
officials said the costofliving increase will boost social 
security payments by 87 billion in 1989 
here are some other changes for 1989 that the agency announced 
retirees ages 6569 will be able to earn 8880 without losing 
benefits up from 8400 currently 
beneficiaries under 65 will be able to earn 6480 without 
penalty up from 6120 
workers will need to earn 500 for a quarter of coverage up 
from 470 
benefits are rounded down to the next dollar which means most 
people wind up with an increase slightly smaller than the exact 
inflation rate 
in addition most ssi beneficiaries also get regular social 
security and their entitlement to welfare benefits usually goes 
down when their social security check goes up 
many economists contend that social security benefits will have 
to be curbed next year as part of a renewed effort by the next 
administration to reduce the countrys huge budget deficits 
however both michael dukakis and george bush have competed with 
each other to assure voters that they will not touch social 
security benefits

land he said reminding the crowd at a downtown shopping mall 
that copiers play a significant role in generating the 160 billion 
pieces of mail the postal service delivers each year

invented on oct 22 1938 
rochester was the birthplace of the xerox corp and remains the 
home of the companys largest manufacturing plant the headquarters

postal service will immediately become popular with canadians on 
vacation in this country 
the new postal rate for sending a post card to canada is 21 
cents up from 18 cents last year 
these stamps will carry the likeness of the man who 
revolutionized the business world frank said in a ceremony at 
the temporary chester carlson station where the new stamps were 
being sold 
carlson is the 42nd person to be honored in the postal services 
great american series of stams which seeks to acknowledge 
people who arent famous but who made famous contributions to the 
country

sinclair lewis and environmentalists rachel carson and john 
audubon along with doctors politicians and scientists 
carlson a patent attorney in new york city who noticed that 
there never seemed to be enough carbon copies of patent 
specifications perfected his idea by tinkering in the kitchen sink 
after his discovery carlson spent four years trying to interest 
companies in making a machine that could use his innovative process 
and finally talked the haloid co of rochester into using the 
process 
haloid which later changed its name to xerox corp put out the 
first office copier the xerox 914 in 1959 a machine that was the

a chain of 26 new york city supermarkets 
announced thursday that it was joining the united farm workers 
boycott of california table grapes becoming the first chain in the 
nation to do so 
however the boycott by red apple supermarkets has largely 
symbolic value since the california grape season is nearly over 
company chairman john catsimatides made the announcement inside 
a red apple store in manhattan joined by local political leaders 
including city council president andrew stein and manhattan borough 
president david dinkins and two daughters of the late sen robert 
f kennedy 
the united farm workers has been urging the public to boycott 
california table grapes until growers stop using five controversial 
pesticides that the union believes are dangerous to both workers 
and consumers 
i think there has to be more of an awareness by consumers of 
what the growers are doing to the food supply catsimatides said 
in a telephone interview he said he decided to join the boycott 
after meeting earlier this year with ufw leader cesar chavez 
a spokeswoman for the farmworkers union trish gunning said red 
apple was the first supermarket chain in the nation to join the 
boycott although 18 individual markets in california have removed 
grapes from their shelves 
she conceded that the summer grape season is nearly over 
meaning red apple would not have had california grapes on its 
shelves much longer anyway however she said its a great 
symbol its a tremendous victory for the boycott

french liquor company pernodricard sa won a 
skirmish friday in the long takeover battle for irish distillers 
group plc when an irish court ruled that the friendly suitor could 
retain a key block of irish distillers shares 
irish distillers irelands leading whisky maker also is the 
target of a rival hostile bid from grand metropolitan plc of 
britain which was not involved in the litigation 
grand met said pernodricard could not claim control of irish 
distillers because of pending investigations into the way 
pernodricard originally obtained shareholders promises to sell 
their irish distillers shares and because the irish court left open 
the possibility for appeal 
the common markets european commission britains panel on 
takeovers and mergers and irelands fair trade commission are 
looking into the matter 
pernodricard has offered 285 million irish punts or around 
428 million for irish distillers that is equivalent to 450 irish 
pence or 675 a share grand mets higher offer of 332 million 
punts or 525 irish pence a share was raised from 400 pence a 
share in response to pernodricards bid 
trading in irish distillers shares was suspended friday 
afternoon at the companys request at 414 british pence 729 
on the london stock exchange 
the irish court decided that dublinbased fruit merchant 
fiifyffes plc unconditionally sold its 2004 percent block of 
irish distillers shares to pernodricard 
pernodricard contended that it had made a binding oral 
agreement to buy the shares from fyffes the day before grand met 
made the higher offer for irish distillers fyffes subsequently 
sold the shares to grand met at the higher price 
pernodricard said the fyffes shares would give it 528 percent 
of irish distillers of which only 5 percent is owned outright by 
pernodricard with the remainder in shareholders irrevocable 
promises to sell their shares 
grand met said it controls 25 percent of the irish company 
irish distillers said its board of directors noted the decision 
with satisfaction and that the board continues to recommend 
that shareholders accept the pernodricard offer 
thierry jacquillat pernodricards managing director said the 
court ruling augurs favorably for the success of pernodricards 
takeover bid

disapproval expressed by international 
business machines corp over big blue wine has prompted winemaker 
jack ransom to scale down his marketing plans 
ransom began last summer bottling red white and rose wines at 
his chateau georges winery under the big blue label the wine also 
sold by ranson under the rivendell name was promoted as the wine 
of choice for an international organization of former ibm employees 
called big blue 
however ibm which at first had said it had no formal 
affiliation with the name big blue in september voiced concern 
over possible trademark infringement because the company 
manufactures a typewriter ribbon called big blue 
ibm spokeswoman rita black said the computer giant was also 
concerned about the lettering on the big blue wine label because it 
was similar to the letter style used in ibms corporate logo black 
said the firm would take appropriate action if necessary 
ransom now says he wont add to the big blue label a chardonnay 
and cabernet as he had planned 
sales have been more than brisk ransom said 
nevertheless we dont want to inflame the situation with ibm any 
further by introducing new wines 
we do not believe that there is any infringement ransom 
said nevertheless we do not have the resources or fight ibm 
and are therefore withdrawing the new products we will continue to 
market the present big blue products however 
ibm spokesman michael shore on friday said he wasnt permitted 
to comment on the activities of any other companies 
he refused to say whether ibm plans to take legal action against 
the wine company 
i think we were just continuing to look into the matter and 
thats really about as far as weve gone shore said

continental airlines asked the us court of 
appeals on friday to order the department of transportation to 
comply with its earlier decision awarding the lucrative 
seattletokyo air route to the houstonbased carrier 
earlier this week the department had decided that despite the 
earlier appeals court decision it was going to reconsider the 
selection of continental to fly the route 
elliott seiden associated general counsel for texas air corp 
which is continentals parent company said the airline friday also 
asked the department to drop its plans to reconsider the case 
seiden said the airline feels that the official who made the 
reconsideration decision acting assistant secretary gregory dole 
should be disqualified because he was asked questions about the 
seattletokyo air route by washington democratic sen brock adams 
during a senate subcommittee hearing in late september 
senator adams intruded into the seattletokyo route case by 
urging dole to have the department reconsider its decision and that 
the route be awarded to united said seiden by questions and 
statements senator adams has called into question mr doles 
impartiality and given an appearance of bias on the part of mr 
dole 
seiden said that adams as a member of the senate commerce 
committee will consider doles nomination to be an assistant 
secretary 
fridays developments were just the latest in the twoyear 
battle over the 100 million route sought by three of the nations 
major airlines united american and continental 
at various times administrative law judges and top department 
officials have recommended that each of the three airlines fly the 
route 
continental had filed a suit asking the appeals court to enforce 
the initial decision by an administrative law judge in the case 
which recommended that continental be awarded the route 
in august the appeals court ruled that continental should 
receive the route because the department had violated its own 
administrative procedures 
but on tuesday the department said that it would take another 
look at the case 
we are very confident the dot action is unlawful and the court 
will view it as such said seiden given the nature of the 
request we believe the court will act promptly 
seiden also said the department might rule as early as the end 
of the month on continentals request that it drop the review of 
the case 
we are going to use all available legal means to defend our 
route order said seiden 
the seattletokyo route in question had previously been flown by 
pan american world airways but united assumed the route 
temporarily when it purchased pan ams pacific division in 1986 
the department approved the purchase but only on the condition 
that the seattletokyo route be dealt with separately

two northwest lawmakers friday urged the 
japanese ambassador to the united states to help revive talks aimed 
at eliminating japanese trade barriers to us timber products 
representatives of our wood products industry are justifiably 
frustrated by this apparent impasse and are urging that some 
aggressive corrective action be taken by our government rep ron 
wyden dore and rep sid morrison rwash said in a letter to 
ambassador nobuo matsunaga 
wyden and morrison said the united states had expected the talks 
would resume after secretary of state george shultz and the 
japanese foreign minister signed an agreement in 1986 the 
administration has been pressing for new talks since august 
we are concerned that we have not yet received a favorable 
response from the japanese representatives the letter said 
the two lawmakers said that earlier negotiations had achieved 
important progress in resolving wood products trade disputes 
but specific barriers remains impeding the free and open flow of 
american forest products which are in great demand in the booming 
japanese residential and commercial construction industry 
last year japan imported 18 billion worth of us wood 
products about twothirds of those us imports were raw logs 
japan imports roughly half of the wood products shipped from the 
united states to pacific rim countries 
a recent congressional study found that us wood products 
manufacturers could lose up to 2 billion per year in potential 
sales in pacific rim countries as a result of trade barriers such 
as those imposed by the japanese 
among the barriers japan has imposed is a 20 percent tariff on 
laminated lumber products such as plywood 
wyden and morrison said they hoped a spirit of cooperation 
would prevail adding they preferred that this issue be settled 
through negotiation rather than confrontation

tyson foods inc began a sweetened and 
hostile 9412 million tender offer friday for holly farms corp 
its biggest competitor in the poultry processing business 
holly farms which earlier this week rejected a 900 million bid 
from tyson said it would study the 52ashare offer securities 
analysts said they expected holly farms to fight a takeover attempt 
investors apparently expected bidding for holly farms to 
continue although tyson said it would not raise its offer any 
further holly farms stock rose 275 to 5362 a share in new 
york stock exchange composite trading friday 
analysts said tyson the nations biggest poultry producer 
would increase its market share from 18 percent to 28 percent if it 
were successful in taking over secondranked holly farms 
i think that if holly farms werent already out looking for 
a white knight that they will be now said napoleon overton a 
securities analyst with morgan keegan at memphis tenn where 
holly farms is headquartered its obvious that tyson foods is 
dead serious about acquiring holly farms 
a white knight is a friendly suitor that rescues a target 
company from a hostile takeover attempt 
overton called holly farms vulnerable 
if youre a holly farms stockholder youve got to think 
just prior to the first offer the stock was in the 40 area 
relatively speaking 52 looks pretty good he said 
in todays environment of takeovers and acquisitions if a 
third party is willing to pay you more than the stock market or the 
company youve got to consider it he said 
tysons offer was scheduled to expire nov 18 
the companys previous bid was for 45 a share plus a quarter 
share of tyson class a common stock for each of holly farms 181 
million outstanding shares 
the memphisbased holly farms has 10 business days to respond to 
tysons offer tyson attorney jim blair said he did not expect to 
hear from holly farms until the end of that time 
overton expected holly farms to fight the tyson bid 
albert klein director of research for robyns capital at new 
york said he did not know what defenses holly farms might be able 
to mount other than finding a white knight 
after the first bid holly farms activated a shareholder rights 
plan known as a poison pill takeover defense aimed at making 
a hostile takeover attempt prohibitively expensive 
blair said tyson believed it could defeat that move in court 
if enough shareholders tender their stock then we think the 
court will knock that poison pill out blair said it will 
depend on how many tender their stock 
the offer was advertised friday in the wall street journal and 
the new york times 
don tyson chairman and chief executive officer of tyson was 
out of his office and unavailable for comment friday a spokesman 
said 
r lee taylor president and chief executive officer of holly 
farms said in a statement after the first offer the board of 
directors of holly farms believes the best longterm interests of 
the company and its shareholders will be served by the company 
continuing to operate as an independent entity 
tysons operations include hatcheries feed mills processing 
plants and a sophisticated marketing arm tyson produces 14 million 
pounds of chicken meat each week and sells chickens to 
supermarkets fast food chains and institutional customers 
last year tyson reported net income of 67 million on sales of 
about 18 billion 
about half of holly farms sales are in chicken the company 
reported 1987 earnings of 362 million on sales of 16 billion

precious metals futures prices fell sharply friday in a 
disappointed reaction to the governments report of a moderate 03 
percent rise in retail prices last month analysts said 
the inflationsensitive metals market had been looking for a 
slightly greater increase in the consumer price index 
on other markets cattle were lower while pork futures were 
mixed grains and soybeans posted moderate losses energy futures 
were mixed and stockindex futures advanced 
gold silver and platinum prices were due for a downward move 
after the gains of the past two weeks and the labor departments 
report on consumer prices provided a catalyst analysts said 
gold settled 380 to 390 lower on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the contract for delivery in december at 41150 a 
troy ounce silver was 125 cents to 134 cents lower with december 
at 6285 a troy ounce 
platinum futures on the new york mercantile exchange settled 
1090 to 1260 lower with october at 52890 a troy ounce 
the selloff began with orders from overseas customers to 
liquidate their gold holdings in reaction to the 
lowerthanexpected inflation number said stephen platt metals 
analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
the overseas selling gave us our initial thrust down platt 
said there also was a lot of disappointment over the gold 
markets inability to react to the recent dollar weakness and to 
early strength in the crudeoil market 
golds failure to rally on those bullish signals sent the silver 
and platinum markets into a tailspin analysts said 
the relatively low inflation number continued a trend that was 
blamed for golds plunge below 400 a troy ounce last month 
its difficult to make a case for large purchases of precious 
metals at this time as a hedge against inflation theres nothing 
to suggest were going to have a wild bout of inflation in the next 
few months said david syphen manager of metals futures trading 
for merrill lynch capital markets inc in new york 
cattle futures finished mostly lower while pork futures settled 
narrowly mixed on the chicago mercantile exchange ahead of some 
agriculture department reports that pointed toward higher beef 
prices and lower bacon prices 
the quarterly cattleonfeed report pegged the number of cattle 
being fattened for slaughter on feedlots oct 1 in the 13 largest 
cattle states at 86 million head down 5 percent from a year 
earlier 
feedlot placements dipped 10 percent in the third quarter 
compared to the same period a year ago while marketings off of 
feedlots increased 2 percent to 62 million a record thirdquarter 
high 
cattle producers reduced their feedyard placements and the size 
of their herds because of the summer drought which dried up 
pastures and raised the cost of feed grains analysts said 
in another report the usda said the amount of frozen pork 
bellies in cold storage fell last month to 294 million pounds from 
426 million pounds the market had expected an even lower number 
so analysts predicted a drop in porkbelly futures prices next week 
live cattle settled 35 cent lower to 17 cent higher with 
december at 7442 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 22 
cent lower with october at 8170 cents a pound live hogs were 30 
cent lower to 15 cent higher with december at 4187 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 35 cent to 97 cent higher with february 
at 4962 cents a pound

the key to a new opec production agreement 
rests on ironing out sharp differences between iraq and iran the 
cartels president said friday 
rilwanu lukman spoke as the pricing and longterm strategy 
committees of the organization of petroleum exporting countries met 
for a second day to discuss a new output ceiling for the 13nation 
group 
iraqi oil minister issam abdulraheem alchalabi told reporters 
late friday the ministers had broken up into informal groups to try 
to work out differences 
he declined to say how the talks were progressing although he 
said he was optimistic 
a third formal meeting of the two committees was scheduled for 
saturday opec sources said 
opecs current ceiling for 12 of it 13 member nations is 1506 
million barrels a day but the cartels current production is 
estimated at close to 21 million barrels a day 
the resulting oversupply of oil on international markets sent 
crude prices plummeting recently to below 12 a barrel far below 
the official opec target of 18 the cartel scheduled the madrid 
meetings in hopes of moving toward a new agreement that would limit 
output and stabilize prices 
lukman who is also nigerias oil minister said we have to 
get them iraqis back into the quota fold and then we talk about 
whether to go up or down on a new ceiling 
lukman and the oil ministers of saudi arabia and venezuela say 
they would reject a new production pact that excludes iraq 
iraq has refused to abide by any opecmandated production quota 
since 1986 demanding it be given a quota equal to irans 
2369millionbarrel daily limit 
iran has rejected that condition the two countries who had 
been at war since 1980 reached a ceasefire in august but remain 
bitter enemies 
before the start of thursdays meeting iranian oil minister 
gholamreza aqazadeh reiterated his countrys opposition to parity 
with iraq 
oil industry analysts say iraq has been pumping at least 26 
million barrels of crude a day an amount that could be pushed to 
37 million barrels a day by mid1989 with the completion of a new 
pipeline through saudi arabia to the red sea 
both iraq and iran heavily dependent on crude exports for 
revenue need massive amounts of capital to rebuild their 
warbattered economies 
saudi arabias oil minister hisham nazer indicated he believed 
iraq was willing to reenter the opec quota system but he did not 
say at what production level 
opec secretary general subroto said friday the work needed to 
hammer out a new agreement will require the cartel to call several 
more committee meetings before its scheduled nov 21 full 
ministerial conference in vienna 
the opec pricing committee includes oil ministers from algeria 
saudi arabia nigeria indonesia and venezuela while the longterm 
strategy committee comprises iraq iran kuwait saudi arabia and 
venezuela 
the remaining opec members are ecuador gabon libya qatar and 
the united arab emirates

consumer prices rose a moderate 03 percent in 
september the smallest gain in three months as a steep drop in 
gasoline costs offset higher food and clothing prices the 
government reported friday 
the increase in the labor departments consumer price index 
meant consumer prices were rising at a moderate annual rate of 41 
percent last month down from an annual rate of 52 percent in 
august 
the most recent inflation report triggered an automatic 40 
percent costofliving increase for the nations 384 million 
social security recipients the second highest boost in the last 6 
years 
the increase which will increase the average retired workers 
pension by 21 a month will show up in january 
economists who had been worried about a new inflationary spiral 
fueled by tight labor markets and droughtdriven food increases 
said the price slowdown in september was an encouraging sign 
the september price report should allay a lot of the 
inflationary fears that were in financial markets the past few 
months said david bassett an economist with the wefa group an 
economic consulting firm in bala cynwyd pa 
in the financial markets stock prices rose the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials edged up 231 points to 218350 setting 
a new 1988 high for the third time this week 
bond prices fell modestly pushing yields on longterm treasury 
bonds toward 89 percent while the dollar slipped in busy 
foreignexchange trading 
in the oil futures market prices edged lower as traders awaited 
word on progress by two committees of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries that were meeting to discuss the cartels 
overproduction 
the september report will be the last news on consumer prices 
released before the november election a fact that should help 
george bush who has been citing the reagan administrations 
reduction of high inflation rates as one of its biggest economic 
achievements 
richard rahn a bush economic adviser and chief economist of the 
us chamber of commerce said that despite dire warnings to the 
contrary inflation has remained remarkably steady 
crow not turkey should be on the thanksgiving menus of the 
many analysts who have been predicting accelerating inflation this 
year he said 
for the first nine months of the year inflation has been rising 
at an annual rate of 45 percent little changed from the 44 
percent increase for all of 1987 
many economists believe that a significant drop in world oil 
prices will more than offset expected increases in food costs to 
hold inflation down for the rest of the year 
we are getting some temporary luck because lower oil prices 
are helping to balance the effects of the drought said david 
wyss an economist with data resources inc of lexington mass 
but wyss warned that oil prices which have fallen sharply 
because of the inability of oil exporting countries to agree on 
production quotas could rebound just as suddenly if the members of 
opec do reach agreement on supply limits 
the 03 percent overall rise in consumer prices in september was 
down slightly from increases of 04 percent in july and august as 
gasoline prices fell by 17 percent the biggest decline since 
february 
however food prices climbed 08 percent and clothing costs shot 
up 22 percent these two components accounted for 70 percent of 
the september price increase 
fruit and vegetable prices led the grocery store advance 
climbing by 45 percent while beef prices were up 11 percent and 
poultry prices rose 13 percent analysts said those gains 
reflected the lingering effects from the summers drought 
the rise in clothing costs reflected higher prices for new fall 
clothes but analysts noted that a similar big boost in spring 
apparel prices was rolled back in later months as retailers were 
forced to offer steep discounts 
the drop in gasoline prices the largest since a similar 17 
percent fall last february sent pump prices 273 percent below 
their peak of march 1981 home heating oil costs were down as well 
falling by 21 percent but the price of natural gas and 
electricity taken together rose 06 percent 
new car prices rose 06 percent in september reflecting 
smallerthanusual sales incentives offered to clear out unsold 
inventories 
the september inflation data triggered the automatic 4 percent 
costofliving increase for social security recipients it will 
mean the average monthly benefit will rise from 516 to 537 
the government calculates the benefit increase based on the 
change in one portion of the consumer price index wages paid to 
urban workers from july through september of one year to the same 
period of the following year 
benefits have risen automatically with the consumer price index 
since 1975 with the exception of six months in 1983 that were 
skipped to help bail the social security system out of a financial 
crisis 
in another government report the labor department said 
americans average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation 
rose a seasonally adjusted 05 percent in september after falling 
a sharp 13 percent in august the worst drop in four years 
the september increase stemmed from a rise in the number of 
hours worked and in the earnings per hour which more than offset 
the increase in consumer prices

minorco sa the luxembourgbased holding company 
bidding for control of consolidated gold fields said friday it had 
obtained shareholder support for the terms of its offer 
minorco whose 15 billion bid is due to close tuesday also 
said it had raised its stake in the company to 2957 percent with 
the purchase of 132 million ordinary shares since oct 11 
the purchases representing 06 percent of consolidated gold 
fields 2134 million shares were purchased after consolidated 
gold fields share price declined below the level of the minorco 
bid minorco is offering 33 and one new minorco share for every 
two consolidated gold fields shares 
with minorco shares closing unchanged at 1170 in london on 
friday the minorco bid values each consolidated gold fields share 
at 1256 consolidated gold fields shares closed friday at 2217 
down 26 cents 
minorco said shareholders at a special general meeting gave 
their approval to a resolution to increase the authorized share 
capital or the number of shares the shareholders will allow the 
company to issue to cover the bid 
if the bid is successful minorco expects to have to issue 797 
million new shares representing about 319 percent of the enlarged 
share capital 
minorco owned 2894 percent of consolidated gold fields 
ordinary shares at the time it launched its bid sept 21 
consolidated gold fields share price quickly jumped above the 
minorco offering price which then was valued at 23 cents a share 
concern that the bid would be disqualified by the british 
government on competitive or national interest grounds subsequently 
sent consolidated gold fields shares plunging their friday 
closing levels represent a drop of about 350 from their highs 
shortly after the minorco bid was announced 
a decision on whether the bid should be investigated by the 
monopolies and mergers commission for those reasons is due out

investigators to look into possible insider trading and 
concertparty share ownership of stock in consolidated gold fields 
the latter occurs when one company secretly agrees to buy stock for 
another firm 
consolidated gold fields which requested the investigation has 
alleged that insider dealing and share building by parties related 
to minorco occurred in the weeks before the sept 21 launch of the 
minorco bid which it is fighting

fending off the takeover attempt 
the investigators have been asked to report to the trade and

owners of the seabrook nuclear plant on 
friday made their case for a quick lowpower license as they told 
federal regulators how they would pay to shut down the plant if it 
ran at low power but never operated commercially 
in a filing to the nuclear regulatory commission new hampshire 
yankee which would operate the 56 billion plant said it would 
cost 211 million and that owners are willing to foot the bill 
the nrc ruled a month ago that before seabrook could get a 
lowpower license its owners must prove they can pay for 
decommissioning the reactor if they receive the 5 percent testing 
permit but never secure a fullpower commercial license 
according to the report the 211 million is the cost to 
completely decommission and dismantle the project taking apart and 
disposing of radioactive components paying nrc fees 
decontaminating the plant and paying overhead and accounting costs 
new hampshire yankee spokesman rob williams said the nrc 
required the owners to address only those four steps 
owners have agreed to pay the cost proportionate to their 
ownership shares the report said the lead owner with 36 percent 
public service co of new hampshire would pay about 76 million 
mired in its seabrook debt public service filed in january for 
bankruptcy reorganization 
seabrooks fourthlargest owner with 116 percent massachusetts 
municipal wholesale electric co would pay about 24 million 
mmwec decided in june to pull out of seabrook but the new 
hampshire yankee report said mmwec has up to 10 million set aside 
for decommissioning costs 
another troubled seabrook owner vermont electric generation and 
transmission cooperative owns less than one half of 1 percent and 
would owe 8400 the report said that portion would be paid by 
sources that are paying for the cooperatives monthly operating 
share 
we feel the submission of the plan and the financing 
arrangements further demonstrates that we are ready to begin 
lowpower testing as soon as possible said new hampshire yankee 
president edward brown 
the report said it would cost between 320 million and 390 
million in 1988 dollars to cancel the project as it stands now 
unlicensed and idle due to evacuation planning problems the 
figures were developed to assist the parties involved in public 
services bankrutpcy proceedings 
however that vastly higher figure includes costs for 
demolishing seabrooks completed first reactor and mothballed 
second reactor settling all contracts taxes and claims and 
disposing of nuclear fuel already loaded in unit 1 
williams said plant owners do not have estimates of how much it 
would cost to cancel seabrook if it conducted lowpower testing but 
never got a commercial license

bargainers for caterpillar inc one of 
the worlds biggest producers of construction equipment negotiated 
intensely friday with united auto workers locals to reach agreement 
on final issues keeping the two sides apart on a new contract 
union representatives planned to meet into the night with the 
four locals to discuss a new proposal 
uaw international bargainer randy arrington speaking hours 
before an 11 pm strike deadline said only one issue remained 
between the company and pontiac ill local 2096 he declined to 
elaborate 
after months of bargaining and two contract extensions both 
sides announced thursday that tentative agreement had been reached 
on nearly every central issue including provisions for substantial 
pay raises and increases in both health and pension benefits 
but as of late friday disagreement remained between the company 
and four uaw locals over the special job classifications issue 
bargainers from both peoria local 974 and decatur local 751 had 
said their memberships were willing to strike over that issue if it 
wasnt resolved 
the locals have objected to the companys insistence on 
establishing special job classifications for highly technical jobs 
because they said it threatened the unions traditional seniority 
system 
workers trained to fill these hightech positions could not be 
bumped from their jobs by untrained workers with more seniority 
even if the senior worker faced layoff 
company officials maintain however that management cannot 
afford to invest in new automated machinery and specialized job 
training unless it can depend on having those workers remain on the 
job 
larry solomon president of decatur local 751 said friday that 
his membership was firmly against any further extension of the 
contract 
the membership will support us in the strike solomon said 
theyve been itchy they think we should have been on strike all 
along 
but later in the day solomon said that some progress had been 
made and that he was more optimistic a compromise could be reached 
on the special job classification issue 
mark polzin a caterpillar spokesman confirmed that the company 
had met with the pontiac local friday the decatur peoria and 
aurora locals met among themselves throughout the day 
polzin said the company also was holding its own meetings 
as far as i know theyre just trying to figure out what 
direction to take from here he said 
the four locals without agreement decatur peoria aurora and 
pontiac have about 15000 of caterpillars 18000 uaw workers 
denver york pa and memphis tenn locals already have 
tentative agreements and the davenport iowa plant is being closed
