afghan resistance leaders talk as 
though they are on the threshold of victory soviet troops are ready 
to leave afghanistan and the kremlins client regime in kabul is 
tottering 
but the afghan guerrillas are as paralyzed politically as they 
were a decade ago when they started fighting their countrys 
sovietbacked totalitarian government 
unable to put aside internal rivalries the guerrillas have yet 
to come up with a coherent plan for the future as the soviet union 
tries to negotiate with them in a lastminute show of seeking a 
political solution to a messy war 
it is a davidandgoliath image the communist superpower unable 
to vanquish ragged bands of mountain men with its missiles and 
warplanes dispatches one of its sharpest negotiators yuli 
vorontsov first deputy foreign minister and ambassador to kabul 
to saudi arabia iran and pakistan to meet the insurgents 
the fractious alliance of seven pakistanbased guerrilla groups 
does not even agree on whether its leaders should be meeting 
vorontsov let alone how to govern afghanistan if it should get 
the chance 
time is running out the soviet withdrawal according to a 
unsponsored agreement signed in geneva last april is supposed to 
be completed by feb 15 
the new chairman of the sevenparty alliance sibghatullah 
mojaddidi leader of the afghan national liberation front seems to 
epitomize this uncertainty 
softspoken and genteel the bespectacled graybearded former 
islamic theology professor readily acknowledges he cannot speak for 
all six other leaders in the alliance 
mostly we try our best he said in an interview a few hours 
before heading to islamabad where vorontsov has been meeting 
foreign ministry officials of pakistan one of the chief champions 
of the guerrillas the insurgents also have been armed by the united 
states saudi arabia and other arab nations 
what then is the point of talking to vorontsov whose country 
already has accepted the principle of a broadbased afghan 
government to supplant the one headed by its old protegy president 
najib 
if we refuse and reject negotiations with the russians we will 
be blamed by the world mojaddidi said for 10 years we have 
been asking for this it is a great success whether we get a 
result or not 
mojaddidi said the insurgents should propose only one or two 
leaders a president a prime minister or both to take over from 
najib former head of the feared and loathed khad the afghan secret 
police force modeled after the soviet kgb 
other guerrilla leaders favor selecting an entire cabinet or 
calling parliamentary elections a monumental task in a nation 
where war snow and mountains have rendered vast regions all but 
inaccessible 
adding to the logistical problem is the fact that onethird of 
the 15 million afghans have fled as refugees to other countries 
about 3 million are in pakistan another 2 million are in iran 
where eight more guerrilla groups operate independently from the 
those in pakistan 
relatively moderate leaders favor calling exking zahir shah home 
from exile in italy to serve as a symbolic head of government the 
most fervent islamic fundamentalists reject any role for the king in 
postsoviet afghanistan 
the people are completely fed up with the guerrilla 
leadership said an afghan analyst who monitors events in 
afghanistan and peshawar the town 20 miles from the afghan border 
where the seven parties maintain seven separate headquarters 
what is going to happen are they going to fight each other 
its a serious possibility the analyst said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
asked whether the alliance would break up he said there is no 
alliance how is it going to break up there are seven parties 
seven political departments seven military departments seven 
financial departments 
they decide between themselves to have a spokesman and then 
every other leader makes public statements completely against the 
alliance he said 
mojaddidi took over as the alliances chairman and spokesman on 
jan 1 succeeding burhanuddin rabbani who led the first talks with 
vorontsov a month ago in taif saudi arabia 
rabbani head of the jamiateislami relinquished the 
chairmanship after three months in keeping with the alliances 
tradition of a revolving leadership 
mojaddidi ahmed gailani leader of the national islamic front of 
afghanistan and mohammad nabi mohammadi leader of 
harakateinqilabeislami are the comparative moderates in the 
alliance all three have suggested bringing back the king as a sort 
of living flag to unite the people long enough to choose a 
government 
the other four groups in the alliance espouse a more 
fundamentalist form of islam than that advocated by mojaddidi 
gailani and mohammadi 
the most intransigent opponents of monarchy are gulbaddin 
hekmatyar of hezbeislami and abdul rasul sayyaf of the 
ittehadeislami 
the other two leaders younus khalis and rabbani also have 
opposed the return of the king but they have toned down the 
vehemence of their earlier rejections khalis group like 
hekmatyars is named hezbeislami

a high school canceled classes for a 
second day thursday after a custodian was diagnosed with 
legionnaires disease and another custodian began showing symptoms 
of the disease 
test results to determine if the second custodian at hunterdon 
central regional high school has the disease should be available in 
about five days said marilyn riley state health department 
spokeswoman 
the bacteria that causes legionnaires disease is transmitted 
through the air from vaporized water ms riley said health 
officials inspected the building thursday for bacteria sources 
samples of water will be taken friday and sunday from the school 
she said 
our feeling is if were going to have to run a disrupted 
school day because of the testing we may as well take one more day 
off said district spokesman willard richard were also 
concerned about any possible health hazard we dont want to be 
taking chances 
a 33yearold male custodian who officials have declined to 
identify was diagnosed with legionnaires in december he was 
responding to treatment at warren hospital in phillipsburg and was 
expected to be released soon ms riley said he was admitted to the 
hospital dec 18 
a 44yearold custodian at the school became sick jan 2 with 
pneumonia and a high fever he also was responding to therapy and 
doing well in hunterdon medical center in flemington she said 
legionnaires disease is fatal about in 15 percent to 20 percent 
of confirmed cases said robert breiman a medical epidemiologist at 
the centers for disease control in atlanta it is usually 
successfully treated with antibiotics 
the source of legionnaires disease would be easier to find if 
the second custodian has the disease but it would not confirm that 
the bacteria was at the school because the men could have been in a 
common place other than the school when they contracted the 
bacteria breiman said 
if only the one case is confirmed it will be harder to determine 
its source he said 
about 1850 students from flemington readington delaware 
raritan and east amwell townships attend the school 
people under 20 years old usually are not affected by the 
bacteria called legionella pneumophila breiman said it most 
commonly strikes elderly people and those whose immune systems are 
weakened he said 
legionnaires disease was named from an outbreak at the 
pennsylvania american legion convention at the bellevuestratford 
hotel in philadelphia in july 1976 thirtyfour people 29 
legionnaires or family members and five other people who had been 
near the hotel eventually died of the disease 
about 800 to 1000 cases of legionnaires disease are reported to 
the center each year breiman said there is no vaccine he said

the pentagon has released photographs and a 
dramatic audio tape of the uslibyan dogfight over the 
mediterranean that it says prove its pilots were provoked and acted 
reasonably in downing the libyan planes 
the photographs although of poor quality show at least one of 
the two libyan mig23 fighters carried missiles the libyan 
government has claimed both its planes were unarmed 
the cockpit audio tape clearly records the pilot of the lead us 
navy f14 tomcat citing each of five attempts to maneuver away from 
the approaching libyan jets then along with a second f14 
shooting down the mig23s 
libya has asserted that the incident wednesday was connected to 
growing american complaints that a libyan chemicals plant is being 
readied for fullscale production of poison gas president reagan 
has said he would not rule out a military strike against the plant 
which libya claims is merely a medicine factory 
the pentagon said there was no link between the factory dispute 
and the air battle which it said began while the navy tomcats were 
flying a routine protective patrol for the aircraft carrier john f 
kennedy well off the libyan coast 
in paris on thursday secretary of state george p shultz hinted 
that reagan may be willing to work out a deal with libya that would 
not require destruction of the plant 
before arriving in paris for an international conference on 
chemical weapons where the uslibyan dispute will take center 
stage shultz acknowledged even some of americas allies are not 
convinced the plant is a weapons facility 
in his first public comments on wednesdays air battle with 
libya reagan on thursday said the american pilots had done the 
right thing in firing their missiles 
our pilots acted completely in selfdefense reagan said as 
he boarded air force one in los angeles where he ended two weeks of 
vacation 
the audio tape released thursday by the pentagon indicated that 
early in the confrontation the american aviators became concerned 
about the libyans intent 
after carrying out his fifth maneuver to evade the libyan jets 
the pilot of the lead f14 says bogies have jinked back at me 
again for the fifth time theyre on my nose now inside of 20 
miles 
at this point the lead aircraft commander decides to defend 
himself 
master arm on he says master arm on centering up the t 
bogies have jinked back into me again sixteen miles centering the 
dot 
the phrases centering up the t and centering the dot 
refer to the use of a cockpit steering cue to ensure an optimum 
missile launch position when ready the pilot calls out fox 1 
as the code for firing a sparrow missile 
fourteen miles fox 1 fox 1 
aw jesus responds the backseat radar weapons officer 
ten miles hes back on my nose fox 1 again the pilot calls 
out 
the release of the photo and audio tapes came as state department 
sources disclosed the united states had sent a straightforward 
message to libya through diplomatic channels to let them know 
our point of view on dogfight 
one state department official who declined to be identified 
said the message contained the same type of information released by 
defense secretary frank c carlucci explaining why the united 
states considered the action justified self defense 
no response from the libyans has been received the official 
added 
at the united nations meantime the united states offered the 
same message to the security council saying the us planes fired 
on the libyan aircraft in reaction to hostile actions that 
constituted an armed attack on american forces 
us ambassador herbert s okun made the statement in a letter to 
the 15member council which held private consultations on libyas 
protest of the incident but libyan ambassador ali sunni muntasser 
called the incident a premeditated act of aggression and said 
the libyan fighters were unarmed on routine reconnaissance 
ordinary flying 
in releasing the video tape chief pentagon spokesman dan howard 
declared thursday it tells me that the libyan ambassador to the 
un is a liar thats the first thing it tells me 
they were obviously armed aircraft with obvious hostile 
intent 
the audio tape paints the drama of the melee complete with the 
heavy breathing that comes from maneuvering a highspeed fighter in 
tight turns and indications of how hard it is to maneuver behind a 
mig to get a tone and get off a clear shot with a missile 
after a second attempt to maneuver away from the migs the f14s 
go to a warning yellow weapons hold status 
that is an intermediate stage in the process of preparing to fire 
in self defense 
later after the lead f14 had fired a second sparrow missile the 
two libyan fighters came into view the second f14 then fires a 
sparrow and the weapons officer in the lead f14 reports to his 
pilot okay hes got a missile off 
at this point it becomes almost impossible to determine who is 
talking but the tape continues

the american f14s that shot down two libyan 
mig23 fighters were operating under guidelines that say us forces 
can open fire only when threatened administration officials said 
defense secretary frank carlucci discussing the incident with 
reporters wednesday said the f14s from the aircraft carrier uss 
john f kennedy fired in selfdefense and were operating under 
normal peacetime rules of engagement 
such rules are never publicly disclosed except in general terms 
they were the subject of controversy after an iraqi jet fired at 
the uss stark in the persian gulf may 17 1987 killing 37 us 
sailors and after the uss vincennes shot down an iranian commerical 
airliner last july 3 killing 290 passengers and crewmembers 
for forces in the persian gulf the rules were tightened after 
the stark incident to give commanders in the field more freedom to 
exercise command authority and decide when to fire said lt jim 
wood a navy spokesman 
but the ships and planes accompanying the kennedy were operating 
under more or less the same rules as they would have been before the 
stark or vincennes incident said wood 
there is a basic premise that the officer in charge must defend 
his ship at all cost wood said 
in wartime that means that anything not identified as a friend 
is an enemy in peacetime anything that is not identified as an 
enemy is a friend he said the peacetime rules of engagement 
enable our forces to adequately defend themselves when there is 
danger of hostility 
the judgment of when to fire he said is left to the judgment 
of the onscene commanders in this case the pilot of the lead 
f14 on the patrol 
if you are a pilot leading a flight of aircraft and felt there 
was imminent danger of being attacked you dont need to wait to be 
fired on said wood 
although the decision to fire rests on the unit commander the 
rules themselves are approved at the highest level said wood 
the president ultimately approves them as he made the change 
for the persian gulf after the stark incident they are usually made 
at the recommendation of the fleet commanders he said 
additionally if unit commanders perceive themselves under 
greater danger they may order their weapons kept at the ready 
without a change in the rules of engagement he said 
navy officers are briefed thoroughly prior to any deployment 
overseas he said additionally descriptions of the situation in 
specific regions are frequently written in classified publications 
that all officers have access to 
those guidelines are dynamic and vary depending on geography 
the rules governing ships off the coast of libya are a lot tighter 
for example than those off the coast of spain where there is less 
perceived danger he said 
for forces operating near libya he said given the ever 
present possibility that foreign aircraft or other combatants were 
present there would be weekly if not daily review of the rules of 
engagement 
wood said that the pilots and officers aboard the kennedy 
definitely would have been tested in a written manner prior to 
their departure from norfolk their home base in virginia last 
august

a powerful weapon in oliver l norths defense 
arsenal may be silenced by the prosecutions decision to drop the 
two central charges against him in the irancontra case 
the exmarines continued demand to include national secrets in 
the case was delaying the trial while independent counsel lawrence 
e walsh fought a rearguard action with intelligence agencies over 
the release of classified information demanded by the court 
faced with the reagan administrations refusal to allow more 
disclosures of secret information in his own evidence walsh 
streamlined the case thursday by asking the court to dismiss the two 
charges most laden with national security problems 
if as expected us district judge gerhard a gesell grants 
walshs motion the prosecutor will surrender the most politically 
explosive charges which allege a criminal conspiracy to divert 
usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
but laurence tribe a constitutional scholar at harvard 
university law school who has done some legal work for walsh says 
whats left is a lean and mean set of allegations that north 
shredded documents lied to congress and obstructed a presidential 
investigation of the irancontra affair 
walsh can proceed without the cloud of national security 
hanging over the remaining charges against the former national 
security council aide tribe said 
the move may also defuse the difficult legal issue raised by 
norths issuance of subpoenas for president reagan and 
presidentelect bush to testify in court 
that question unresolved by the courts could have delayed the 
trial for months while white house lawyers fought the summonses all 
the way to the supreme court 
without charges he conspired to corrupt reagans legitimate 
effort to sell arms to free american hostages north will have a 
harder time justifying the need to subpoena reagan and bush 
when those issues are removed both the need for presidential 
testimony and the need for the great bulk of the documents that 
allegedly might compromise national security are radically 
reduced tribe said 
north can no longer claim that he thought he was acting with 
presidential authority when he secretly helped finance the 
nicaraguan rebel cause with money from the armsforhostages deals 
therefore he has no need to use classified documents to support a 
contention that his modus operandi in other authorized covert 
operations was no different from the role he played overseeing the 
secret arms network for the contras 
it is unlikely gesell would let north claim he thought he was 
acting with presidential authority when he shredded national 
security council documents and lied to attorney general edwin meese 
iii during the november 1986 presidential investigation of the 
irancontra affair 
the 12 remaining charges are all felonies that carry penalties 
ranging from two to 10 years imprisonment and fines up to 250000 
its a sad day when we think charges of lying to congress 
obstructing a presidential inquiry and destroying documents are 
somehow relatively unimportant tribe said in the broader 
scheme of things those charges should be taken very seriously 
some of those charges may still pose some secrecy problems for 
walsh and he may have to jettison a few other counts of the 
indictment but it greatly increases the likelihood that the case 
will go to trial in the near future 
tribe said it also reduced the possibility that reagan would 
reverse his oftstated position and issue a pardon the need to 
use a pardon as a means of preserving the alleged confidentiality of 
executive information is a greatly reduced one 
another harvard university law professor alan dershowitz said 
he thought dismissal of the two major charges against the retired 
marine colonel will make it a lot easier for north to defend 
himself at trial 
he won this battle dershowitz said it remains to be seen 
whether hes gonna win the war

thaddeus armie eure the nations 
longestserving state official and who calls himself the oldest 
rat in the democratic barn today ends a 52year career as north 
carolinas secretary of state 
he is the essence of north carolina its symbol says rufus 
edmisten a democrat elected to succeed the 89yearold eure 
governors come and go but mr thad has remained he has been 
north carolina 
state officials were sporting red bow ties one of the 
flamboyant secretarys many trademarks at a ceremony honoring him 
in the capitol today 
eure is retiring voluntarily from a post no one has been able to 
wrest from him since he was elected in 1936 when he ran on the 
campaign slogan give a young man a chance 
his term has spanned the administrations of 12 governors and nine 
presidents president reagan wrote eure in 1987 congratulating him 
on serving longer than any state government official in the nation 
still he is reluctant to discuss his feelings about his 
departure saying only i havent thought too much about that 
besides the bowtie which eure said he began wearing as a young 
man and never saw a reason to switch he is known for the straw hat 
he dons each spring and his regular attendance at an annual 
democratic gathering in the mountains called the ramp festival 
where politicians swap stories and eat ramps which are wild leeks 
eure onced dubbed himself king of the ramps 
he also gained a reputation for his colorful annual orientation 
classes for freshmen members of the general assembly where he 
dispensed history and advice and for a 1984 remark that the last 
governor he admired was clyde r hoey who took office in 1937 
those were the trying days the 1930s governor hoey was a 
quarterback and he ran the plays eure said he knew how to 
handle people no matter what their gripe was he knew how to handle 
them 
eure was born and raised on a gates county farm and was mayor of 
winton from 1923 to 1928 he served a term in the state house of 
representatives from 192930 and was defeated for reelection but 
remained in raleigh as house clerk 
the firstfloor northeast corner office he moved into as clerk 
in 1931 is the one he has occupied for 57 years today will be his 
last day there 
the office was crammed with a halfcenturys worth of political 
memorabilia including photographs of eure with presidents truman 
and johnson and a donkey that dispenses cigarettes from its south 
end when its ear is pressed eure said he would move the stuff into 
his garage 
its like succeeding an institution edmisten said every 
time i touch something thats been his its like im on hallowed 
ground i know i wont hold this office 52 years i probably 
wont even live another 52 years 
the accolades began almost as soon as eure announced his 
retirement more than a year ago saying his wife minta was in ill 
health 
last may eures son thad eure jr paid tribute to his father 
in an interview saying the elder eure mortgaged his home for 
40000 to give his son money to start the angus barn 28 years ago 
the popular raleigh restaurant now grosses 4 million to 5 million 
a year 
thad eure jr died last month the eures also have a daughter 
armecia black 
on tuesday at eures final meeting with the council of state 
gov jim martin presented him with a north carolina flag that had 
flown over the state capitol 
the rotunda ceremony today was the brainchild of a member of elon 
colleges centennial year planning committee elon has a special 
affinity for eure who has been a member of the schools board of 
trustees since 1942 and chairman since 1955 
ive been on the board nearly half the age of the 
institution eure said he plans to retire from the chairmanship

the poor nations atomic bomb on saturday envoys from more than 
140 nations will meet in paris to discuss changes in the 1925 geneva 
protocol prohibiting the use of poison gas and other chemical 
weapons 
here is a list of some gases in the chemical arsenal drawn from 
chemical warfare a book by edward m spiers published by 
university of illinois press 
 
chlorine chlorine irritates the nose throat and lungs and 
causes coughing smarting of the eyes nausea and vomiting a 01 
percent concentration causes death within a few minutes 
phosgene phosgene is 10 times more toxic than chlorine but 
severe symptoms and death may not occur for several hours after 
exposure phosgene damages the air sacs of the lungs causing a 
deadly accumulation of fluid in the lungs victims less severely 
affected may cough bloody sputum for months phosgene caused 80 
percent of the gas fatalities in world war i a 002005 percent 
concentration kills in minutes 
mustard mustard gas blisters and burns the skin or lungs on 
contact it also attacks the eyes causing inflammation of the inner 
surface of the eyelids and causes hoarse coughing and bleeding from 
the nose symptoms are delayed for 24 hours unless one is directly 
exposed to the liquid a concentration of onetenth of a milligram 
per liter for 10 minutes is fatal 
hydrocyanic acid hydrocyanic acid affects the nervous system 
also known as prussic acid it can be absorbed through the skin and 
acts rapidly on its victims symptoms progress through giddiness 
headache and unconsciousness to convulsions and paralysis of the 
brains respiratory center a concentration of 25 milligrams per 
liter is fatal 
lewisite lewisite is absorbed through the skin and lungs acting 
as both a blisteringburning agent and a poison because it contains

in a speech marking the 30th anniversary of his 
rise to power fidel castro seemed intent on erasing any doubts 
about the stability of cubansoviet relations or the state of his 
revolution 
it was a backtobasics speech wednesday with strong attacks on 
the reagan administration and ringing praise for the soviet union 
and cubans for sacrifices made in the building of socialism 
as castro described it the revolution has turned a corner two 
years ago the cuban leader was unhappy with evidence of laziness 
and corruption but on wednesday night before tens of thousands of 
people he said he detected a new spirit of dedication 
those honored at the ceremony included eight workers who castro 
said contributed thousands of hours of volunteer work for a huge 
exhibit of the revolutions achievements in social and economic 
development 
one the workers had been known to work 30 hours at a stretch 
castro said his colleages wanted him to go home but who was 
going to stop him the president asked 
the exhibit known as expocuba opened thursday with 45 
pavilions focusing on cuban innovations in science technology and 
other fields 
we respect the paths others take in the construction of 
socialism castro said seemingly dismissing as inconsequential 
the deepening contrasts between the cuban and soviet systems 
his prior criticism of liberal reforms introduced by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev had touched off speculation about a 
possible loosening of ties between the two countries 
but castro went out of his way to praise soviet policies on 
detente and disarmament and said the two countries see eyetoeye on 
the international debt and trade 
we will never forget the soviet support received in decisive 
moments he said 
in the past year and a half there has been modest improvement in 
us relations with cuba but on wednesday night the cuban leader 
sounded much like the castro of old in his remarks about the united 
states 
a slight chill fell over the crowd when castro touched on this 
subject it was near the end of his nearly threehour oration and 
with dusk long past many in the audience huddled together for 
warmth 
curiously castro omitted criticism of the us downing of two 
libyan fighter planes wednesday over the mediterranean but he 
assailed the reagan administrations threats to destroy a libyan 
plant the united states says is intended to produce chemical weapons 
it was shortly after this that the chief us representative in 
cuba jay taylor rose from his seat in the diplomatic section and 
walked out 
castro warned that the united states may be embarked on a policy 
of aggression against third world countries under the cover of 
detente with moscow 
he also indicated it may be time to reform the united nations to 
dilute the power of the five members of the security council who 
each have veto power the five are the united states the soviet 
union china britain and france 
it is unjust for britain a country of 50 million to have veto 
power while no such authority is given india which has 880 million 
people castro said 
he said 4 billion people live in the third world but the current 
un structure leaves power in the hands of countries that represent 
a minority of the global population 
castro mentioned the un issue in expressing concern over a 
usled move in the security council to reduce because of 
financial considerations the number of un forces who will oversee 
the transition in namibia to independence from south africa

the change in contractors at the savannah 
river plant is aggravating the already long delay in restarting 
the weapons plants nuclear reactors according to a department of 
energy official 
the engineering continuity is being lost as du pont co 
prepares to turn over operations at srp on april 1 to westinghouse 
savannah river co said richard w starostecki the does deputy 
assistant secretary for safety health and quality assurance 
theres a lot of turmoil that is natural when you have a change 
in management starostecki told the aiken standard the complex 
near aiken produces tritium for nuclear bombs 
the doe official told the augusta chronicle on thursday that the 
first reactor still could be restarted by october he also said 
reports of cracks discovered in reactor cooling lines are not a 
new issue 
the augusta newspaper reported that srp officials are reviewing 
criteria used to determine when a cracked cooling pipe is replaced 
officials are monitoring about 25 cracks in cooling lines at the 
three reactors 15 of which are in the kreactor which is the one 
slated to be restarted first 
at present the cracks will not delay the restart the newspaper 
said 
doe officials also said wednesday they expect congress to approve 
their planned request for up to 300 million toward building the new 
military production reactors 
the request is the first by the does new production reactor 
office and is part of a proposed 68 billion project to build 
reactors at srp and the idaho national engineering laboratory 
the doe would rely primarily on the srp reactor to supply 
perishable tritium gas for us nuclear weapons in the next century 
the smaller idaho reactor would serve as backup 
ronald w cochran acting director of the npr office said he is 
confident that congress will approve the funding this years 
appropriation will go toward safety analysis environmental planning 
and reactor design he said 
construction of the savannah river npr is expected to start in 
1991 or 1992 providing thousands of construction and engineering 
jobs for the aiken area 
cochran said the defense officials are concerned about current 
delays at srp because of the plants major role in the military 
project 
starostecki who helped oversee commercial nuclear power for 
about 12 years as a member of the us nuclear regulatory 
commission said only aggressive clearlydefined management can 
deal with equipment problems that inevitably develop with all 
nuclear reactors 
while praising westinghouses qualifications he said he is 
frustrated with how long its taking to complete 
earthquakeresistance improvements and other work at srps reactors 
srps three operable production reactors p k and l have been 
shut down since last summer for a doeordered upgrade of management 
and hardware 
the 1950sera reactors are the nations only source of perishable 
tritium gas an essential component of nuclear weapons 
starostecki said srp needs a management team with clear lines of 
responsibility and authority to promptly find and fix reactor 
safety problems 
the doe hopes to authorize restart of the k reactor this year 
with the others to follow but no current target dates have been 
announced 
he has recently sent teams of experts to srp to investigate 
cracking found in several reactor coolant pipes but said tuesday 
the investigators have not brought back anything startling 
the commercial nuclear industry has learned to deal with pipe 
cracking he said and srp must benefit from that knowledge

a former minister unemployed and too proud 
to accept handouts looked to god to provide for his family until 
the day his teenage son died of starvation on thursday he was 
charged with murder 
larry cottam a former seventhday adventist minister who was 
fired from his job as a truck driver last march rejected public 
assistance and refused to send his children to public school where 
they would have qualified for school breakfast and lunch programs 
neighbors and officials said 
his belief was that god would provide said roy 
dieffenbach cottams former boss at norandex inc in wilkesbarre 
authorities on wednesday found no food in the wellkept house in 
a middleclass suburban neighborhood in northeastern pennsylvania 
where cottams 14yearold son eric died of starvation 
cottam his wife and daughter were all hospitalized for 
malnutrition 
dr george e hudock jr the luzerne county coroner on 
wednesday ruled the teenagers death a homicide 
hudock said the teenager had not eaten in at least three weeks 
and weighed 69 pounds about 80 pounds less than normal for his 
height 5feet10 
cottam 39 was listed in fair condition thursday at mercy 
hospital in wilkesbarre his wife leona 37 and daughter laura 
12 were listed in serious condition at the hospital 
cottam and his wife were arraigned thursday at the hospital on 
one count each of criminal homicide and two counts each of reckless 
endangerment and endangering the welfare of their children 
they could face the death penalty if convicted on the homicide 
charge district magistrate donald swank set a preliminary hearing 
for jan 13 
social service agencies will take custody of the daughter 
district attorney correale f stevens said 
cottam said he blamed himself for the tragedy 
i dont hold god responsible the error was on my part not 
gods cottam told wbretv in wilkesbarre on wednesday night 
my wife and i feel terrible about erics death but my faith in 
god is not shaken 
cottam was pastor of four local seventhday adventist churches 
with a total congregation of about 250 when he was transferred to 
pittsburgh the family moved back to nuangola in 1985 after he lost 
his post in pittsburgh 
dieffenbach said he fired cottam in march over a dispute 
involving the condition of a truck that cottam refused to drive 
without two new tires 
those who know the cottams said the closeknit family kept to 
themselves and rarely left their modest twostory home 
larry and leona cottam had kept their children out of school 
since they returned to the area in 1985 and in may won a twoyear 
court battle to educate them at home 
elsa heintzelman a crestwood school district official said 
erics death could have been prevented if the children were enrolled 
in public schools she said the children would have qualified for 
school meal programs 
weve all been very sad that this happened because it need not 
have happened at all ms heintzelman said 
richard deane superintendent of the school district said the 
children were smart and had scored well on standardized tests 
ms heintzelman said the school district was concerned about the 
childrens welfare because they were so isolated and also 
questioned whether the cottams were qualified to teach at home 
according to ms heintzelman eric and laura cottam werent 
allowed to talk to adults without their parents being present and 
werent allowed to take part in activities with other children 
the wilkesbarre times leader on thursday reported that the 
family lived on savings and cut costs wherever possible the 
newspaper said the cottams had unplugged their refrigerator bought 
dayold bread and kept their house cold

a plan to save billions of dollars by closing 
dozens of military bases around the country goes before congress 
after being approved ahead of schedule by defense secretary frank c 
carlucci 
the house and senate must deal with the plan in its entirety 
approving or rejecting it the congressional resolution would then 
go to the white house senate and house leaders have predicted 
congress will approve the plan 
carlucci told reporters thursday that us military leaders 
strongly endorsed what he called a unique opportunity to save 
money 
we just have to move ahead and do this carlucci said we 
have not closed a base since 1978 and i think that fact speaks for 
itself we need to step up to the plate here 
carlucci took just a week to review the recommendations of a 
government commission that had been created by the administation and 
congress to review 4200 military properties 
after seven months of review the commission recommended outright 
closure of 34 military installations and 52 military housing 
complexes and partial closure of five other installations it 
recommended that 54 other bases receive new missions or additional 
personnel 
members of the commission estimated the closings would save the 
nation 693 million a year in the short term and up to 56 billion 
over two decades 
carlucci said he would have endorsed the closing of even more 
bases but did not want to tinker with the delicate political 
compromise 
i would not try to change this law at this time or this report 
at this time simply because we do have the political momentum that 
is necessary to make a breakthrough in this area he added 
carlucci and adm william j crowe chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff rejected the view of one commission member former sen 
thomas eagleton dmi that the navy had stonewalled to avoid 
having its bases closed 
the other members of the commission did not join senator 
eagleton in his dissent said carlucci i have spoken to the 
secretary of the navy william ball who has assured me that from 
his perspective the navy gave its full cooperation to the 
commission 
crowe a navy officer told reporters it makes good sense from 
the standpoint of both management and economy to allow dod the 
department of defense to cut back marginal installations as 
circumstances change 
this is especially true in times of fiscal constraints where 
the resulting longterm savings assume even more importance 
carlucci as a strong proponent of base closings had been 
expected to approve the list all along but he demonstrated his 
enthusiasm by announcing his decision before a legal deadline of 
jan 15 
he also said he would ask congress for 500 million in the fiscal 
1990 budget and another 500 million in the 1991 budget to help 
cover the expense of closing bases such as relocating employees 
i would like to reiterate that this is a unique opportunity to 
make significant changes to dods base structure which will not only 
save taxpayer dollars but also improve our nations defense 
carlucci said 
carlucci said he sympathized with local political leaders who 
worried about the economic impact of individual base closings 
but on the other hand they cant have it both ways he said 
they cant say that weve got to have efficiencies and economies 
in the department of defense and at the same time defend bases 
which a totally nonpartisan highly qualified group examined 
and said this particular base can be closed

the national pork producers council has 
formally asked the us government to impose import duties on pork 
products from canada claiming the canadian meat is subsidized and 
competes unfairly with american hog farmers 
council president ray hankes said thursday a petition was filed 
jan 4 with the us international trade commission and the commerce 
department asking that countervailing duties be imposed on fresh 
chilled and frozen pork products from canada 
state pork associations and a number of us meat packing 
companies also signed the petition a ruling on the councils 
petition is expected in about six months he said 
a countervailing duty would eliminate the unfair advantage 
canadian farmers have over us pork producers because the canadian 
government subsidizes its hog production hankes said in a 
statement released here canadian pork producers can benefit from 
more than 20 potential subsidy programs 
there has been an import duty on live hogs from canada since july 
1985 a move upheld by the us court of international trade during 
a lengthy appeals process 
but the american producers contend the import duty on live hogs 
doesnt prevent canada from slaughtering its hogs and shipping the 
pork to us markets the commerce department ruled in 1985 the 
import duties on pork products were justified 
the us court of international trade acting on an appeal by the 
canadian meat council overruled the commerce decision 
as a result canada has increased its shipments of pork into the 
united states by more than 52 percent since 1984 hankes said 
the council also said imports of canadian pork have reduced the 
revenues of us hog producers by as much as 337 per 100 pounds of 
hogs marketed in the first nine months of 1988 according to a study 
by economist glenn grimes of the university of missouri 
overall the imports from canada were said to cost american 
producers as much as 697 million in lost revenues last year 
the agriculture department said imports of canadian pork products 
in 1988 totaled a carcass weight equivalent of 4402 million pounds 
through dec 3 according to canadian government figures that 
compared with 5015 million pounds for all of 1987 and 3139 million 
pounds in 1984 
kevin bost of the departments economic research service said in 
a telephone interview the countervailing duties on live hogs from 
canada have trimmed the imports sharply from more than 13 million 
head in 1984 to around 650000 to 700000 head last year shipments 
may be around 700000 head in 1989 he said 
according to usda figures american hog farmers produced around 
156 billion pounds of pork in 1988 an estimate of carcass weights 
after slaughter the forecast calls for a slight increase this year

the agriculture department says private 
exporters have sold the soviet union an additional 390000 metric 
tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said thursday the wheat was part of 2 
million tons authorized dec 23 under the export enhancement 
program or eep 
the wheat was bought under a longterm supply agreement with the 
united states now in its sixth year 
sims said the wheat is for shipment in january and february 
counting some wheat left over from previous eep arrangements the 
soviets have about 12 million tons still available under the 
program 
the soviet union bought more than 9 million tons of wheat under 
eep arrangements during the fifth year of the grain agreement the 
pact expired last sept 30 but was later extended through dec 31 
1990 
with the latest sales the soviets have bought about 760000 tons 
of us wheat for delivery in the sixth year of the pact sales also 
include 102 million tons of corn along with some soybeans soybean 
meal and sorghum 
only the wheat is subsidized however 
the eep arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other 
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in 
order to meet foreign competition the exporters then collect free 
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or 
subsidies 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 390000 tons of 
wheat would be about 143 million bushels 
sims said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy rate of 
2283 per ton or about 62 cents per bushel he said the bonuses on 
the 390000 tons of wheat will be paid to five companies cargill 
inc 100000 tons toepfer international inc 50000 ferruzzi usa

farmers have signed enough fragile land into a 
longrange conservation program to reduce annual soil losses by 
nearly 600 million tons according to the agriculture department 
wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation 
service said thursday that about 28 million acres have been 
contracted under the conservation reserve program or crp the goal 
is to retire 40 million to 45 million acres of highly erodible land 
from crop production by 1990 
an agency spokeswoman leslie wilder said the 600 million tons 
of soil saved each year would be enough to cover one square mile or 
640 acres to a depth of 429 feet 
under the program farmers agree to take qualified land from crop 
production for 10 years in return they get federal assistance to 
plant the land in protective grass or trees and then draw annual 
rental payments those average around 49 per acre each year

at one time us diplomats got into hot water 
if they clinked teacups with members of the plo but now the state 
department has switched signals 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley confirmed thursday 
that american officials around the world have been given the green 
light to mix with palestine liberation organization representatives 
but strictly on an informal basis 
there have been instructions that have allowed people in social 
settings to respond socially to introductions mrs oakley said 
the spokeswoman emphasized the new policy for formal contacts 
between the united states and the palestinian group still stands 
us ambassador to tunisia robert h pelletreau is the only person 
authorized to conduct americas diplomatic dialogue with the plo 
the one channel for communication with the plo officially 
remains our ambassador in tunis mrs oakley said 
the spokeswoman declined to outline the exact diplomatic 
niceties of teacups and handshakes but said people may respond 
socially in a setting if youre introduced there may be the 
exchange of courtesies 
these are not to be construed as official contacts she said 
adding it was expected such meetings might occur at diplomatic 
receptions or in a group at a large party if people meet or are 
introduced 
one state department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the new policy came about after president reagans 
historic decision in middecember to reverse the policy of refusing 
to deal with members of the organization long shunned as a band of 
terrorists reagan said plo chairman yasser arafat had met us 
demands by renouncing terrorism and recognizing israels right to 
exist 
two days after secretary of state george shultz announced 
reagans decision to drop the 13year ban on contacts with the plo 
pelletreau met for an hour and 40 minutes with a plo delegation in 
tunis where the organization has its headquarters 
suddenly ambassadors wanted to know what to do if they got 
calls from a plo representative saying ive been told we can have 
a dialogue when can we meet the official said 
he said a message was sent to all us embassies as a guideline 
for people about what they can and cannot do its just normal 
courtesy 
it means no one will go out of their way to set up a meeting 
but if youre in a social setting and a plo official walks up to 
you of course youre not going to walk away he said now you 
can have a social conversation 
the official stressed that the change was a subtle one 
we havent recognized the plo we havent recognized a 
palestinian state he said 
even so any contact is considered sensitive 
in 1979 un ambassador andrew young resigned his post amid 
controversy over an unauthorized meeting he held with a plo 
representative in a manhattan apartment

three national unions and two states are asking 
a federal court to block government regulations lifting a 40year 
ban on work at home in five apparelrelated industries 
eliminating the ban on homework is a profoundly reactionary 
attack on the most basic legal rights of working men and women 
jay mazur president of the international ladies garment workers 
union said thursday after the suit was filed in federal district 
court here 
it would condemn tens of thousands of workers mostly 
immigrant women to abject exploitation and threaten the working 
standards of countless others mazur said of the labor department 
plan scheduled to take effect monday 
the suit contends that the regulations contain inadequate 
safeguards to prevent violations of laws governing minimum wage 
child labor maximum work hours workplace safety and other issues 
it also attacks the departments record of enforcing regulations 
covering homework in the knitted outerwear industry which has been 
legal for the past four years and asks that the government be 
ordered to consider reinstating the ban in that field 
labor department officials said they had not seen the suit and 
therefore could not comment on most aspects but they rejected its 
characterization of enforcement of labor laws in the knitted outwear 
industry 
its just not true that the department cannot enforce the fair 
labor standards act in a homework environment said alan mcmillan 
a deputy assistant secretary we absolutely feel that we can 
mcmillan said the fouryear experience monitoring homework in the 
knitted outerwear industry had prompted the department to strengthen 
its enforcement procedures and include the improvements in the new 
regulations 
the five manufacturing industries covered by the new rules are 
gloves and mittens buttons and buckles handkerchiefs embroideries 
and to a limited extent jewelry 
much of the womens apparel industry is not affected but the 
labor department last week said it was considering drafting proposed 
rules for lifting the broader homework ban too and the outcome of 
the suit could signal whether organized labor will be successful in 
blocking that attempt 
about 167000 workers are employed by the five affected 
industries which generated 10 billion worth of production in 1986 
said susan cowell vice president of the ilgwu 
joining the garment workers union in filing the suit were two 
other national unions the amalgamated clothing and textile workers 
union and the service employees international union two new 
yorkbased union locals three apparelindustry employer 
associations representing 255 companies and the states of new york 
and pennsylvania where homework is banned by state law 
industrial homework has always been a way to violate labor law 
with near impunity new york attorney general robert abrams said 
in a statement homework can never be adequately regulated 
named as defendants were labor secretary ann mclaughlin and 
paula v smith administrator of the departments wage and hour 
division which enforces many of the laws the suit contends would be 
violated if the homework regulations were allowed to take effect 
prohibitions on apparel industry homework were adopted in the 
1940s to combat exploitation of immigrants and other lowwage 
workers lifting the bans has been the reagan administrations top 
deregulatory effort in the labor relations area for the past several 
years presidentelect bush has backed the efforts and is expected 
to continue the deregulatory push

education lobbyists say they have the perfect 
way for george bush to fulfill his pledge to be the education 
president raise federal education spending by 10 billion in his 
first term 
theres an education deficit analogous to the grand canyon to 
have someone throw in a shovel of dirt is not going to solve the 
problem said gerald morris president of a 100member coalition 
called the committee for education funding 
the committee suggested thursday that bush start with an 
immediate down payment of 25 billion in the education department 
budget for fiscal 1990 that would be an 11 percent increase over 
the current 219 billion budget 
furthermore the committee said bush should add 500 million to 
head start the preschool program for disadvantaged children that is 
run by the department of health and human services 
we dont see that its unrealistic or unattainable becky 
timmons vice president of the committee said of the spending 
blueprint 
during his presidential campaign bush made several expensive 
education proposals including 500 million for a merit schools 
program to help the disadvantaged 400 million for head start and 
50 million for magnet schools however bush has also vowed to cut 
the deficit and not raise taxes 
he is expected to rework the lameduck budget reagan will be 
sending to congress on monday that document reportedly will 
recommend 35 billion in cuts across the government 
morris said his coalition is not taking positions on the tax 
issue or on which types of domestic spending could be cut to offset 
education increases but he and others said they are encouraged by 
bushs campaign promises his tone of moderation and his 
appointments so far 
we havent had the luxury of working with the administration in 
the last seven years because weve been on opposite sides of the 
fence morris said in reference to the reagan administration 
which repeatedly sought cuts in the education budget 
he said a bush administration is likely to be more hospitable 
we may have a very different and warmer and certainly welcome 
environment he said 
the funding committee is a nonprofit nonpartisan coalition of 
groups that represent more than 50 million students parents 
teachers administrators presidents librarians counselors 
trustees and school board members virtually every major education 
group in the country is a member 
under its plan 16 billion of the 1990 increase would go to 
programs for disadvantaged students of all ages from remedial 
tutoring to college tuition grants another 768 million would cover 
the cost of inflation for all federal education programs while 150 
million would be reserved for presidential initiatives and modest 
increases in small existing programs 
according to the committee education spending accounted for 25 
percent of the federal budget in fiscal 1979 but only 17 percent in 
fiscal 1988 
officials cited the following statistics to make the case for a 
fouryear 10 billion investment 
from 1979 to 1988 pell grants to needy college students went 
from covering 50 percent of all college expenses to 29 percent while 
the buying power of the maximum award declined 13 percent 
head start serves less than 20 percent of the children who 
qualify for it 
chapter 1 the major federal program for disadvantaged 
elementary and secondary school children serves less than half 
those eligible 
federal money for educating handicapped children now covers only 
8 percent of perpupil expenditures as opposed to 125 percent in 
1979

a senate committee chairman wants the fbi to 
look into a newspapers allegations that one of presidentelect 
bushs cabinet nominees headed a gop organization riddled with 
former nazi collaborators 
the oakland calif tribune in an editorial dec 28 said its 
questions should be answered before the senate approves bushs 
nomination of edward derwinski as the first head of the newly 
created department of veterans affairs 
sen alan cranston dcalif who will conduct the senate 
veterans affairs committees confirmation hearings on the 
nomination asked bush to look into the editorials charges in the 
course of its customary background investigation 
the editorial said derwinski associated with former fascists and 
antisemites in 1972 when he headed the executive board of the 
heritage groups for reelection of the president and this year when 
he cochaired bushs coalition of american nationalities 
through a spokesman derwinski said the charges amounted to 
guilt by association 
several members of the coalition resigned this summer after the 
washington jewish week said they had profascist or antisemitic 
records during world war ii 
derwinski who served for 23 years as a republican congressman 
from cook county ill is in the state department as undersecertary 
for security assistance science and technology 
he was not available for comment thursday but a spokesman bill 
anderson said of the editorial it is guilt by association he 
has had nothing to do with the hiring or the service of those 
mentioned in this article anyone who examines his record in 
support for example of jewish organizations or as a diplomat in 
israel can categorically rule out any antisemitism on his part 
anderson said derwinski had lent his name to republican ethnic 
committees in every presidential election campaign since 1960 
cranston in his letter to bush said he raised the issue with 
derwinski wednesday during a nice meeting with him to discuss the 
forthcoming nomination 
he sent bush a copy of the editorial and wrote as you can see 
the editorial raises serious charges 
before the us senate approves him it ought to ask the nominee 
whether he intends to represent american veterans or nazi veterans 
american democratic ideals or those of foreign dictatorships the 
editorial said 
those questions are apt given derwinskis record of service in 
an organization riddled with former nazi collaborators and his 
alleged role in passing us secrets to the south korean cia in the 
late 1970s it said but added 
the record certainly doesnt prove that derwinski is a closet 
nazi sympathizer or a foe of democracy but it does call into 
profound question his judgment in particular his willingness to 
turn a blind eye to the background and beliefs of notorious 
colleagues if they share his anticommunism 
the paper quoted russ bellant author of a study published by 
political research associates in cambridge mass as saying that 
at least four people charged with war crimes were in leadership 
positions of the 1972 republican group derwinski headed 
the research group calls itself an independent organization that 
gathers information on rightwing groups and trends 
the editorial also said that during a 1977 house investigation of 
alleged south korean influence peddling on capitol hill derwinski 
appeared to be responsible for leaking to the korean government the 
defection of an official of the korean central inelligence agency 
but anderson said the house ethics committee investigated and 
cleared derwinski of tipping off the south korean government

the five contenders to replace retiring paul g 
kirk jr as democratic party chairman take to the road this weekend 
for a series of regional meetings aimed at selecting a leader who 
can staunch the flow of voters from its ranks 
the frontrunners for the chairmanship are richard wiener of 
michigan president of the association of state party chairs and 
ronald h brown a washington attorney who was a top adviser to 
jesse jackson in the late stages of his campaign for the democratic 
presidential nomination 
also competing for support were three former congressmen jim 
jones of oklahoma michael barnes of maryland and james v stanton 
of ohio 
ever since kirk announced early last month that he would not run 
for a second fouryear term despite the pleas of many party leaders 
the contenders to succeed him have competed for the endorsements of 
bigname democrats 
brown quickly lined up sens edward m kennedy of massachusetts 
and bill bradley of new jersey and gov mario cuomo of new york 
stanton was backed by former house speaker thomas p oneill jr 
of massachusetts and by house ways and means committee chairman dan 
rostenkowski of illinois 
jones got the support of sens sam nunn of georgia and john 
breaux of louisiana while barnes was backed by former presidential 
nominee walter f mondale and former secretary of state edmund s 
muskie 
but few if any of the big names making endorsements will cast 
votes on feb 10 when the democratic national committee meets in 
washington to elect the new party chairman 
that is where wiener has his strength many of the state party 
leaders who worked with the michigan party chairman quickly lined up 
behind him after kirk decided four years was enough 
many democrats who tried to convince kirk to serve a second term 
argued that a fight for the chairmanship after another losing 
presidential campaign the fifth in six elections for the white 
house would further damage the partys standing among voters 
some democrats privately questioned whether the selection of 
brown who is black and identified with jackson would alienate 
southern and bluecollar voters who have deserted the democrats in 
recent presidential elections 
brown has responded that many of the same democrats who were 
condemning his tie to jackson were cheering last spring when he 
agreed to serve as the candidates convention manager 
jones said the question was philosophy rather than race saying 
that brown was too identified with the partys liberal wing at a 
time when a centrist was needed as the democratic spokesman 
what ron brown is saying is that he should not be judged by 
jesse jackson but by the fact that he was campaign manager for ted 
kennedy against jim carter said the former oklahoma congressman 
and i think thats sort of legitimate and i think thats what the 
decision is going to be made from 
the contenders will meet saturday in chicago with midwest members 
of the dnc and then travel to atlanta for a meeting on sunday with 
southerners 
another session is scheduled for tuesday in newark nj and a 
final one the following saturday in salt lake city 
all five candidates appeared thursday before union political 
directors at the aflcio headquarters 
of the 404 votes on the dnc 46 are cast by union 
representatives but labors influence is considered far greater 
than that and all the candidates will be watching closely next week 
when individual union presidents meet with aflcio president lane 
kirkland to determine whether labor will issue an endorsement

the nations cities expect a more mature 
relationship with the federal government under george bush than 
they have had during the reagan era the incoming president of the 
national league of cities says 
using a parentchild analogy to discuss how cities have fared in 
their dealings with the federal government phoenix mayor terry 
goddard told a national press club luncheon on thursday 
during the sixties and seventies we had a pampered childhood 
and then very abruptly at the beginning of the eighties we were 
orphaned we were thrown out in the storm and we were told to 
fend for ourselves 
were looking for a new relationship a mature relationship 
one that binds two powerful entities the federal government and 
local government into a common purpose and partnership said 
goddard who was recently elected the leagues president 
the league is the nations largest and oldest organization 
representing towns and cities 
although he said the cities had learned to cope stretch 
resources and survive their oliver twist adolescent period 
without washington the 41yearold goddard said municipalities face 
problems like the spread of drugs lack of affordable housing and 
decaying infrastructure and environment 
there is serious trouble in urban america he said 
goddard said the problems of cities are often ignored because 
theyre dull and gradual he said they arent noticed until after 
a system fails after a building collapses or a bridge falls 
through 
but he said the new administration should focus on what can be 
done to prevent catastrophe before it happens 
goddard met thursday afternoon with jack kemp bushs nominee to 
head the department of housing and urban development where he 
presented the leagues proposal for six initiatives for the bush 
administration and the 101st congress to help tackle urban problems 
the proposal includes establishing a council of urban advisers 
developing a comprehensive national housing policy a national 
policy on children and families and a new federal surface 
transportation policy and invigorating federal support for urban 
research 
goddard said cities recognize the federal deficit problem and 
dont seek a return to their pampered days but we do need a 
positive administration response one which is willing to use 
national leadership and coordination to help us save money and add a 
sense of direction 
goddard said bush could demonstrate a commitment to a partnership 
with cities if he consults local officials sets up a mechanism to 
consider the impact of agencies actions and regulations on 
municipalities evaluates approaches cities have found successful in 
dealing with their problems and doesnt rule out spending new funds 
in critical areas 
that done we pledge to help the presidentelect become the 
best urban president this country has known said goddard

media magnates samuel and donald newhouse are 
fighting the irs in us tax court in a case that can have enormous 
financial consequences for the familys privately held publishing 
and broadcasting empire 
the internal revenue service contends the estate of samuel and 
donalds father samuel i newhouse sr owes 600 million in taxes 
if the irs wins it plans to seek an additional 600 million plus 
hundreds of millions of dollars in interest 
one of the major issues is whether the elder newhouse who died 
at age 84 in 1979 controlled the family publishing company as the 
irs contends or allowed decisions to be made by consensus 
since the trials opening on wednesday both samuel and donald 
newhouse have testified the company was run by consensus management 
if theyre right the value of their fathers stock would be less 
and so would the estates tax bill 
the family contends the estate of samuel i newhouse sr should 
be taxed on the basis of newhouse having held 222 percent of the 
companys stock resulting in a tax bill of no more than 47 million 
the irs argues that the estate should be taxed as if the elder 
newhouse ruled the company while he was alive 
the irs acknowledges its engaged in one of its largest tax 
disputes ever the newhouse company owns such major newspapers as 
the newark star ledger the cleveland plain dealer the new orleans 
timespicayune and the oregonian in portland and magazines 
including vogue parade glamour and the new yorker 
the familys principal publishing company is advance 
publications it also runs newhouse broadcasting co 
samuel i newhouse jr told the court thursday that he his 
brother their father and their two uncles all shared in the 
empires decisionmaking before the elder newhouses death 
all of us in the family were obsessed with our business said 
newhouse who testified he became a full partner in the 
mid1950s after beginning his career as a cub reporter writing 
obituaries 
newhouse said his father was not a dictator but part of a 
consensus management in which the family believed were all 
involved with this together 
he said there were no formal votes to make decisions but 
admitted that consensus was sometime reached after heated 
arguments 
asked by irs lawyer howard p levine if the elder newhouse 
determined the salary and dividend declarations of the private 
company newhouse said no its not true 
newhouse said when his father was alive the controlling family 
members would divide up the various properties and make frequent 
visits to assess the operations 
newhouse revealed that in 1979 his salary rose from 239500 the 
previous year to nearly 408000 
he explained that all the family members received a large 
increase that year because they had taken over more responsibility 
after the elder newhouse became ill 
on the trials opening day wednesday donald newhouse also 
insisted that his father did not dominate the decisionmaking 
process 
the case legally revolves around the worth of two classes of 
advance publications common stock owned by samuel newhouse sr at 
the time of his death and a separate class of preferred stock owned 
by five family members at that time 
the irs says the 10 shares of class a stock that the elder 
newhouse held those controlling the company were worth 420 
million and the shares of class b nonvoting stock were worth 
8118 million a total of 12 billion 
independent experts hired by the irs have estimated the companys 
value in 1980 as high as 21 billion 
according to the newhouses the figures should be 86 million 
for the class a stock and 1701 million for the class b stock for 
a total of 1788 million

as four mariel cuban detainees convicted of 
crimes after fleeing their homeland in 1980 were returned to cuba a 
government spokesman said he hoped such repatriations will speed up 
but auxiliary bishop agustin a roman of miami called again for a 
halt to the repatriations saying the cubans had been denied due 
process and that their human rights could not be assured in cuba 
the four who had been detained at the federal prison at 
talladega ala left birmingham shortly after 2 pm thursday for 
the 90minute flight to an airport near havana 
earlier in the day us district judge uw clemon in birmingham 
denied the request to stay the repatriation of jose nodarsevaldes 
and juan cajigalmulen nodarsevaldes 39 was convicted of 
criminal possession of a weapon and assault and cajigalmulen 31 
was convicted of robbery and cocaine possession the justice 
department said 
the other two repatriated thursday were ricardo oliveraquintero 
28 convicted of murder and mario sosahernandez 50 convicted of 
illegal possession of heroin with intent to sell said justice 
department spokesman joseph c krovisky 
the detainees were among 125000 people who had fled cuba in the 
socalled mariel flotilla in 1980 
they were the third batch of prisoners returned to cuba since 
early december 1988 when repatriation of some detainees was resumed 
under a 1984 agreement with that island nation five detainees were 
returned dec 2 followed by four more dec 15 
about 400 cubans are on a justice department list of people who 
might face repatriation and another 400 to 500 are on that list but 
will not be repatriated until they finish serving prison and jail 
terms said immigration and naturalization service spokesman duke 
austin 
asked whether detainees would continue to be repatriated every 
few weeks in groups of four or five austin said we certainly 
hope that the numbers will improve but its all subject to what the 
courts do 
but roman in telephone interview from miami criticized the 
latest deportations and reiterated his call that they be stopped 
we are asking to defer the deportation until we will be 
assured human rights will be observed roman said 
austin contended that special care already has been taken to 
protect their legal rights 
i dont know of any alien in the united states that has ever 
had more legal review of their case than the cubans have austin 
said 
these people have had formal hearings in front of immigration 
judges he said theyve had appeals in front of the board of 
immigration appeals made up of independent law judges theyve had 
legal action in the district court in georgia before the 11th 
circuit court of appeals the supreme court of the united states has 
reviewed their cases twice if that isnt due process i dont know 
what is 
the repatriation program for 2746 cubans was suspended in 1985 
at cuban president fidel castros insistence after 201 were 
returned in 1987 the united states and castro agreed to resume the 
repatriations 
the 1987 agreement set off 11 days of rioting in november 1987 at 
federal prisons in atlanta and oakdale la 
after the riots the justice department began a review process to 
determine which cubans should be repatriated that review resulted 
in the list of the 800 to 900 people to be returned to cuba

a chlorine cloud as big as six 
football fields spewed from a factory thursday near the site of the 
reagan presidential library forcing thousands of evacuations 
backing traffic up for miles on closed roads and freeways and 
injuring three firefighters 
chlorine escaped during most of the day from a 5000gallon 
30ton tank at the traveling west textile co forming a 
greenishyellow potentially deadly cloud on the outskirts of this 
suburb northwest of los angeles 
just after dark a specially outfitted hazardousmaterials squad 
was able to tighten a valve on the tank they got a big wrench and 
tightened the valve said battalion chief larry whelan 
earlier firefighters directed a highpressure 80foot stream of 
water on the tank a process that caked the loose valve with ice 
temporarily sealing the leak 
while the leak was stalled the cloud over simi valley dissipated 
and the valve on the tank was tightened as a precaution the valve 
was then capped whelan said 
at 7 pm the evacuation order was lifted giving way to massive 
traffic jams in this city of 100000 people 
whelan said an estimated 11500 people had been evacuated from 
offices and homes in a 15squaremile area after the leak was 
reported at 740 am the evacuees included at least 1400 students 
1000 business workers and the 125member staff of the simi valley 
enterprise newspaper 
three members of the fire departments hazardous materials team 
were taken to the hospital ventura county fire spokeswoman susan 
chandler said two of them were treated and released the other was 
kept for observation 
we dont expect any major injuries or deaths ms chandler 
said 
the gas from the factory at madera road and easy street settled 
in a huge cloud over the northwest part of the city not far from 
the 100acre foothill site where the 60 million reagan library is 
to be built 
it spread slowly during the day and was 100 feet by 600 yards by 
late afternoon said ms chandler 
traveling west which dyes bulk textiles had been closing down 
the factory in preparation to move out of state fire officials 
said whelan said the tank was drained on tuesday of all but 20 to 
50 gallons of liquid chlorine used to treat plant wastewater before 
it was funneled into the sewers 
chlorine and its compounds are used for bleaching in the paper 
and textile industries for disinfecting municipal water supplies 
for household bleaches and germicides and in the production of many 
organic and inorganic chemicals

the giant plumes blasted into the sky by 
volcanoes may look like ordinary clouds but they contain 
engineclogging ash that can pose disaster for unsuspecting aircraft 
to avoid dangerous events like those that forced two airliners to 
land with engine malfunctions in 1982 a pair of federal agencies is 
launching a new volcano watch program for aviators 
the volcano alert project was announced thursday by the national 
oceanic and atmopsheric administration and the federal aviation 
administration although a formal startup date was not set 
over the years major volcanic eruptions have spewed vast plumes 
of ash to high altitudes where it was spread widely by strong winds 
in one case in 1982 ash from galuggung volcano in indonesia 
caused engine shutdowns in boeing 747 airliners on june 23 and on 
july 13 both planes were forced to land when their engines 
malfunctioned after being coated with the glasslike ash 
more than 20 volcanic eruptions have been reported beneath the 
north pacific air routes between north america and asia in just the 
past five years 
active volcano areas include italy greece new zealand 
indonesia the philippines japan alaska the pacific northwest 
mexico colombia peru ecuador chile east africa hawaii and the 
caribbean 
volcanic ash plumes can spread as high as 60000 feet and 
especially at night it can be difficult for a pilot to tell when a 
cloud is being entered 
in the new warning program noaa weather satellites pilot 
reports and other sources of information will be used to watch for 
volcanic eruptions the us geological survey and the worldwide 
scientific event alert network operated by the smithsonian 
institution will also assist 
while weather satellites are expected to be the primary source of 
information scientists stress that in the early stages of an 
eruption it can be very difficult to tell the difference between ash 
clouds and ordinary water or ice clouds heat imaging satellites 
should help in this area 
once an eruption is detected the faa will be kept advised of the 
location height and movement of ash clouds the civil aviation 
organization of the united nations will also be informed of volcanic 
cloud movement so it can advise airlines from other nations 
the advisories will report height and plume movement at twohour 
intervals and will provide short and longrange forecasts of cloud 
movement

washington mayor marion barry jr whose 
association with a drug suspect is being investigated by federal 
prosecutors has brushed aside suggestions that he submit to a drug 
test to defuse the controversy 
barry told reporters thursday that he has been drugfree in 
previous tests he repeatedly has denied using drugs or knowingly 
associating with drug users 
barry said he has taken drug tests twice a year during routine 
physical examinations 
ive taken a drug test for five years in a row he said 
ive released them twice a year 
that comment caught barrys press secretary john white by 
surprise 
ive been here 18 months and ive never handled the release 
of a test white said i dont know anything about that 
barrys physician dr vincent j roux said he doesnt recall 
giving barry drug tests 
im not sure i have ever given the mayor a drug test roux 
told wusatv i dont remember the physician said he last 
examined barry about six months ago 
barry mayor of the nations capital for a decade is facing his 
most serious political crisis following disclosures that he met last 
month with a man who is the subject of a city police drug 
investigation 
police called off an attempt to make an undercover purchase of 
drugs from the man charles lewis after detectives encountered one 
of the mayors security guards while barry was at the hotel where 
lewis was staying authorities have said 
sources familiar with the investigation say the us attorneys 
office has subpoenaed barrys telephone records and other documents 
barry has acknowledged calling assistant police chief isaac fulwood 
who is supervising the citys drug investigation but has said he 
was trying to speed up the probe and not influence its outcome 
us attorney jay stephens is investigating the incident and is 
expected to interview barry the mayor refused on thursday to answer 
questions about whether he would talk to prosecutors 
barry has acknowledged visiting lewis whom he described as an 
acquaintance but he denied any involvement with drugs or knowledge 
that lewis was the target of a city police drug investigation 
the mayor said in a statement released wednesday night that he 
would cooperate with the federal probe 
lewis a former city government employee later coordinated a 
joint personnel project between the governments of the city and the 
virgin islands he was fired from that job in april after virgin 
islands officials became concerned that the project was becoming too 
costly 
federal sources have said that stephens has expanded his 
investigation to include the virgin islands agreement and the 
interior department which acts as comptroller for the island 
territory is also auditing the program 
joyce fleischman a spokeswoman for the inspector general for the 
interior department said auditors had not yet found a written 
contract for the 260000 project 
district of columbia law requires that such projects have formal 
written contracts 
investigators are trying to learn whether city officials billed 
personal purchases to the virgin islands government and whether 
other spending irregularities occurred 
auditors say that the names of some persons staying in st thomas 
hotel rooms reserved for city officials working on the project do 
not match a master list of employees provided by the city government

the national economic commission already 
facing an uncertain future has lost a court battle to keep its 
deliberations secret 
us district judge joyce hens green ruled late thursday in favor 
of a suit brought by several news organizations who had contended 
that the commissions efforts to bar the public from several 
upcoming hearings represented a violation of a federal open meeting 
law 
the 14member advisory commission was created by congress in 
hopes that the panel could come up with a package of spending cuts 
and tax hikes that would break the sevenyear deadlock on the budget 
deficit 
drew lewis cochairman of the commission had argued that the 
commission would be unable to complete its job if it could not 
hammer out differences in private 
the commission attorneys had also contended that the members of 
the panel were so prestigious that their public discussions on 
economic matters could create chaos in financial markets reacting to 
partial news reports on the deliberations 
but in her ruling green said that congress could have exempted 
the commission from the open meetings requirements of federal law 
but decided not to do so 
fully recognizing that the commissions composition would be 
prestigious and its activities significant to the national need and 
the international community congress made a deliberate choice to 
make this commission subject to the open meeting requirements the 
judge said in her ruling 
the judge said that her ruling did not mean that the commission 
was prevented from ever meeting behind closed doors but she said 
any closeddoor sessions would have to meet the strict definition in 
the law that holding the session in public would significantly 
frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action 
the lawsuit challenging the closed meeting was filed by the 
washington post the wall street journal the bureau of national 
affairs which publishes financial newsletters and stephen 
wildstrom an editor at business week 
public citizen a consumer organization founded by ralph nader 
joined in the case 
eleanor smith an attorney with public citizen said the judges 
ruling was a victory for the publics right to know 
the commissions policy deliberations touch the life and 
livelihood of every american and it is exactly that kind of 
discussion that the law requires to be conducted in the open in our 
democracy smith said in a statement 
david mathiason executive director of the commission said the 
panels attorneys had not yet read the ruling and therefore he could 
not comment on whether the commission would appeal the decision 
mathiason said no decision had been made on whether to cancel the 
commissions next meetings on tuesday and wednesday 
the commission had already canceled a session in early december 
after green had issued a temporary restraining order blocking the 
panel from closing the meeting 
the judges ruling if not overturned would mean that the 
commission would have to hold its debates on ways to cut the deficit 
in open sessions the public hearings the commission has held so far 
have revealed deep divisions on the panel over whether new taxes 
will be needed to balance the budget 
because of this critics had said it was doubtful that the panel 
would be able to craft a plan that would find favor with 
presidentelect bush and congress 
bush who derided the commission during the campaign as a 
stalking horse for tax increases last month appointed former sen 
paul laxalt rnev and former rep thomas ashley dohio as his 
representatives on the panel but he maintained his stance that no 
increase in taxes will be needed to balance the budget

leaders of nicaraguas contra resistance are 
urging the incoming bush administration to impose sanctions against 
the countrys sandinista government to enforce any agreements 
reached in an expected diplomatic offensive 
alfredo cesar the contras chief negotiator said thursday that 
agreement also has been reached inside the contra movement on a 
modified peace plan to be presented next month at a summit meeting 
of central american presidents in el salvador 
cesar said the plan was discussed with us officials thursday at 
a meeting at the state department 
at a news conference cesar said the peace plan a modification 
of an initiative presented last june is supported by all contra 
leaders he said us officials had expressed the hope that the 
proposal would be one not several 
cesar predicted the united states will begin a major and extended 
diplomatic effort to achieve democratic reform in nicaragua soon 
after presidentelect bush takes office 
he said it is likely that military efforts against the 
sandinistas will be put on the back burner at least for the time 
being 
i have no doubt myself that the bush administration will make a 
very serious diplomatic effort with bipartisan support from 
congress as the first way to get a solution he said it will 
be a serious effort that will last several months 
but he said the necessary leverage to pressure the sandinistas to 
make binding commitments and concessions can only come through 
imposing strong sanctions on an escalating scale 
at this moment the military wing of the resistance is idle 
its intact but its idle the troops are sitting in border camps 
cesar said 
so the leverage for the upcoming phase of the negotiations has 
to come from the united states and the diplomatic pressure from the 
big countries of latin america he said 
cesar added one of the most important changes i would expect 
is sanctions for not complying with an agreement that has been 
the key element missing from past efforts 
he said sanctions should be applied against the sandinista regime 
not only by the united states but by the nations of europe and latin 
america as well 
sanctions should range cesar said from diplomatic isolation 
passing through economic pressure and even the use of force if 
necessary 
if sanctions are not applied the new initiative will face a 
very high risk of failing also he said 
cesar said that the us officials with whom he and other contra 
leaders met made no commitments and were very clear in saying they 
could not speak for the bush administration 
cesar said contra leaders will offer a single unified peace 
proposal including three major modifications and additions to 
previous plans 
they are 
the elimination of some sections that cesar said were 
considered too perfectionist for example cesar said the 
contras dropped a condition that all sandinistaappointed 
magistrates resign instead they called on the sandinistas to give 
assurances that the nations supreme court will be composed of 
independent people 
the timetable of the plan was adjusted to provide more 
flexibility and more graduality deadlines of 15 to 30 days for 
meeting conditions of the plan have been extended to 60 days or so 
cesar said 
a new section has been added proposing a national and 
international effort to rebuild nicaraguas economy once democratic 
reforms are under way cesar said this would include an appeal to 
the united states europe and latin america for economic aid 
that is a totally new element cesar said of the final point

the number of consumer complaints against us 
airlines fell in december to the lowest level in four years the 
department of transportation said 
the department also reported thursday that the ontime 
performance of the 13 largest carriers in november worsened the 
ontime mark had held above 80 percent for seven previous months 
including octobers 834 percent but fell to 777 percent in 
november 
the monthly performance reports also showed a slight increase in 
november for mishandled baggage with 617 reports per 1000 
passengers compared with 609 a month earlier 
the department said it received 724 consumer complaints about the 
airlines in december down 40 percent from november and the fewest 
recorded since december 1984 when the total was 552 for the year 
the 23844 complaints represented a 47 percent improvement over 1987 
though the complaint statistics are released at the same time as 
the ontime and mishandledbaggage data they routinely represent 
different months since the complaint figures are more quickly 
compiled 
eastern airlines which early this year was consistently among 
the worst ontime performers had the best record in november 853 
percent eastern also led octobers list with a 903 percent mark 
on time means within 15 minutes of scheduled arrival and the 
records do not count flights delayed because of mechanical problems 
eastern was followed by delta with an ontime record of 798 
percent in november and american west at 792 percent united had 
the worst mark of the major carriers 738 percent likely because 
of its concentration of flights into chicagos ohare international 
airport plagued by congestion and air traffic control problems 
nearly onethird of all flights into ohare were delayed 
but the worst ontime arrival record among the airports belonged 
to san francisco with a mark of 594 percent for all flights 
the airports at charlotte nc atlanta and salt lake city led 
the list for ontime arrivals each exceeding 81 percent 
piedmont registered the worst record for mishandled baggage with 
801 reports per 1000 passengers southwest had the best mark at

a food and drug administration committee is 
recommending no changes in the use of birth control pills saying 
new research on a possible link between oral contraceptives and 
breast cancer is inconclusive 
the committee in an announcement following a daylong meeting 
thursday said that it found the new studies did not show a cause 
and effect relationship between oral contraceptives and breast 
cancer even though portions of the studies suggested a greater 
risk for the cancer among women who started taking the pill at a 
very young age 
the studies are conflicting and inconsistent so it is difficult 
to draw a conclusion the committee statement said 
the committee also declined to suggest any major changes in the 
labeling that accompanies the drug 
the 11member committee is composed of specialists in obstetrics 
and gynecology from 10 states their recommendations will be 
evaluated by officials within the fda 
during the hearing jeffrey perlman a federal researcher told 
the committee that no studies including the most recent establish 
a clear link between breast cancer and birth control pills 
perlman chairman of the contraceptive evaluation branch of the 
national institute of child health and human development told the 
committee there is no overall increase in risks for breast cancer 
for oral contraceptive users 
recent studies by boston university and the royal college of 
general practitioners in england which suggest some connection 
between breast cancer and the pill he said are confusing and 
contradictory 
perlman said his findings were based on analysis of a massive 
government survey called the cancer and steroid hormone study and 
actual occurrence of cancers since 1973 
the results he said show there is a large breast cancer 
epidemic in the united states but the increase in the disease 
cannot be attributed to birth control pills 
an fda advisory committee earlier heard reports from clifford r 
kay director of the royal college of general practitioners study 
and samuel shapiro director of a study undertaken at the boston 
university school of medicine 
both studies showed some increases in breast cancer among some 
subgroups of women taking the pill but even the researchers said 
their own the studies were not consistent and perhaps flawed 
we simply dont know if pill use is associated with a 
significant increase in breast cancer kay admitted 
he said the english study which involved some 46000 women over 
a 20year period did suggest an increase in breast cancer among 
women who have taken the pill for two to seven years but kay said 
the findings contradict many other studies and did not clearly show 
a direct causeandeffect relationship 
shapiro said the boston university study which involved more 
than 6000 women in four cities over a 12year period showed there 
appeared to be an increased risk of cancer among women aged 35 who 
have taken the pill for five years or more 
but he said the studies also show a statistical suggestion of 
greater risk for women who have taken the pill for only three 
months this finding said shapiro is proof of a bias in our 
data 
rich salem a spokesman for ortho phamaceutical maker of 
orthonovum a leading birth control pill said the most recent 
findings are apparently in conflict with other studies and seem to 
be in conflict with each other

agency agree that medicare payments to compensate teaching hospitals 
for higher patientcare costs are hundreds of millions of dollars 
too high 
a report by the general accounting office released thursday said 
the payments to offset indirect expenses from the teaching 
hospitals medical education programs for interns and residents 
could be cut in half 
such a cut would amount to as much as 12 billion this year 
which gao suggested could be redistributed among all hospitals with 
medicare patients 
the department of health and human services in comments included 
in the report agreed that the teaching hospitals are being 
overcompensated it said the adjustment factor that inflates their 
standard reimbursement should be lowered 
medicare spokesman dennis siebert declined to comment on whether 
cuts in these payments would be proposed in president reagans 1990 
budget which is to be given to congress next week 
the extra payments are projected to total 23 billion in the 
current fiscal year for more than 150 major teaching hospitals and 
nearly 800 smaller teaching hospitals that treat medicare patients 
teaching hospitals receive extra payments for the direct costs of 
providing medical education including salaries and fringe benefits 
for residents and teaching physicians those payments amounting to 
about as much as the payments for indirect costs were not addressed 
by the report 
the payments are in addition to the standard hospital 
reimbursements paid by medicare the federal health insurance 
program for the elderly and disabled medicare payments to more than 
5400 teaching and nonteaching hospitals in the current fiscal year 
are projected to total about 50 billion 
the adjustment for the higher indirect costs at teaching 
hospitals is determined by a complicated formula that takes into 
account such factors as the greater number of diagnostic procedures 
performed at these facilities their higher staffing ratios and 
increased recordkeeping 
the medicare payment system takes into account cost differences 
among hospitals related to local wages patient mix and location 
but because of shortcomings in the formula congress has inflated 
the payments covering indirect costs this was done in recognition 
that teaching facilities are located primarily in urban areas and 
treat a disproportionate share of severely ill and lowincome 
medicare patients 
congress set the adjustment factor for fiscal years 198995 at 
765 percent but the report said the figure could be lowered to 
within a range of 373 percent to 626 percent in that range the 
government could save from 416 million to 12 billion in the 
current fiscal year savings could be as much as 15 billion in 
fiscal year 1991 the report said 
however gao recommended an adjustment factor of 509 percent for 
fiscal years 198995 which it said would save 776 million this 
year 843 million next year and 1 billion in fiscal year 1991 
in comments included in the report hhs inspector general richard 
kusserow said president reagans budget for the current fiscal year 
proposed reducing the adjustment factor to 405 percent which would 
be an even deeper cut than advocated by gao congress however did 
not agree and set the figure at nearly double that rate 
the department took issue with several aspects of the report 
including some of gaos technical decisions on data used in the 
formula 
the association of american medical colleges a national group 
representing academic medical center and community teaching 
hospitals and medical schools said gaos estimates were too low and 
fail to account for some of the added costs teaching hospitals face

bettereducated americans smoke far less since the 
surgeon general first warned of tobaccos dangers 25 years ago but 
by 2000 30 percent of those who never went beyond high school will 
still be lighting up researchers reported today 
poorer and less educated people are missing the message that 
smoking is linked to cancer and other numerous health problems said 
researchers at the national centers for disease control in atlanta 
smoking prevalence has declined across all educational groups 
but the decline has occurred five times faster among the higher 
educated compared with the less educated they reported in the 
journal of the american medical association 
one reason may be that much of the antismoking message has gone 
out in newspapers and medical journals typically read by the better 
educated said dr michael c fiore a leader of the cdc group 
little has gone out via mass media especially television he 
said in a telephone interview thursday from madison wis where he 
is now an assistant professor of medicine at the university of 
wisconsin medical center 
from 1974 to 1985 the number of us smokers among people who 
had completed four years of college plummeted by more than a third 
from 285 percent to 184 percent the cdc group said 
but the corresponding drop among people who never graduated from 
high school was 21 percent from 363 percent to 342 percent the 
researchers found 
fiore said that while the number of smokers overall is decreasing 
steadily from more than 40 percent in the 1960s to less than 29 
percent by 1987 differences in smoking patterns based on 
educational status stand out more than those based on gender and 
race 
about 13 million americans quit smoking annually between 1974 
and 1985 but about 1 million young people joined the smoking ranks 
each year during the 1980s the researchers said 
the researchers coled by john p pierce said that if the trend 
continues 22 percent of the population 20 and older in the year 
2000 will smoke compared with 30 percent in 1985 
they further predicted that while less than 10 percent of college 
graduates will be smokers in 2000 at least 30 percent of those with 
no more than a high school education will be puffing 
public health interventions must be made more relevant to these 
slowly changing groups the researchers said only when such 
targeted efforts are successful will smoking have the potential to 
lose its distinction as the number one preventable cause of death in 
the united states 
a spokesman for the tobacco institute a washingtonbased group 
representing the tobacco industry said the study only confirms that 
people in that segment of society enjoy smoking 
the antismoking forces should not adopt some paternalistic 
attitude saying these people are less in a position to take 
information on smoking and health and make a rational decision on 
whether or not they should smoke said gary miller 
smokingrelated deaths claim 390000 americans annually said 
joann schellenbach a spokeswoman for the american cancer society in 
new york 
smoking is linked to lung cancer heart disease chronic 
obstructive lung disease emphysema and cancers of the mouth 
larynx esophagus pancreas stomach bladder and possibly cervix 
ms schellenbach said 
the researchers based their figures on data collected by the 
national center for health statistics through the national health 
interview surveys 
data was collected in seven surveys over an 11year period with 
sample sizes varying from 10000 to 40000 adults 20 years old and 
older who were chosen to represent the population as a whole fiore 
said 
surgeon general c everett koop who during his tenure has warned 
of the dangers of inhaling other peoples smoke and has branded 
nicotine an addictive substance is scheduled to issue a new report 
on progress in the fight against smoking on jan 11 that is the 
25th anniversary of the first report from the surgeon generals 
office that pronounced smoking a health hazard

us naval forces violated a major 
treaty by staging intimidating provocative and unapproved 
military exercises in the panama canal the defense forces said 
a communique from the defense forces commanded by strongman gen 
manuel antonio noreiga said thursdays manuevers violated the 
torrijoscarter treaty because all us and panamanian military 
operations in the canal must be coordinated by both countires 
the communique said nine us navy combat patrol boats fully 
armed with its crew in a state of readiness took part in morning 
exercises thursday at the canals pacific ocean entrance it said 
the boats were escorted by two us black hawk helicopters 
under the treaty signed in september 1977 all military 
operations in the 50mile waterway linking the pacific and atlantic 
oceans must be coordinated by a canal defense group that includes 
representatives of both countries 
canalbased us military officials could not be immediately 
reached for comment 
the panamanian military said it considered the exercise an 
intimidating provocative and unapproved action against the civilian 
population and members of the national and international merchant 
marine community 
the communique said participating in the exercise were three 
103foot patrol boats four 45foot patrol boats and two 20foot 
patrol boats with outboard motors 
the defense forces said it lodged complaints with the us 
government and the canal defense group but received no explanation 
a panamanian television station thursday night broadcast a tape 
of the exercise near the point of the americas at the canals 
pacific ocean entrance 
the us militarys southern command operates along the canal 
with about 13000 troops and 11 military installations 
about 3000 us troops left panama in march after the us 
government imposed economic sanctions against panama in an attempt 
to force out noreiga the panamanian strongman 
last february the noriegadominated national assembly ousted 
elected president eric arturo delvalle and replaced him with 
education minister manuel solis palma 
delvalle had tried to dismiss noriega in february after a federal 
grand jury in miami indicted the military leader on drug trafficking 
charges

nearly 20 million most of it in neatly stacked 
20 bills has been seized here in what authorities said was the 
largest cash haul in the history of the war on drugs 
eleven people allegedly members of a powerful colombian drug 
cartel that controls cocaine distribution in the metropolitan area 
were arrested in the raid thursday 
it is the largest cash seizure in a drug case in the world 
said robert stutman head of the drug enforcement agencys new york 
office at a news conference held among dozens of ordinary brown 
boxes brimming with 20 bills 
this is the result of people laying down 20 a shot for 
cocaine he said 
stutman said 19 million in neatly stacked 20 bills and some 
100 bills were found in boxes inside a passenger van at a queens 
warehouse called zoom furniture 
an additional 630000 three loaded submachine guns a pistol 
and detailed business ledgers were seized after task force members 
executed search warrants at two private homes in queens and on long 
island 
the accounts showed they were doing about 1 million a day in 
cash by selling cocaine throughout the city stutman said 
authorities believe the money was heading out of the country to 
be laundered the 10 men and one woman arrested were charged with 
conspiracy to distribute narcotics sai ann driscoll of the us 
attorneys office 
those arrested were all believed to be members of the powerful 
cali drug cartel which law enforcement authorities say controls 
cocaine distribution in the region 
stutman said the suspects were probably illegal aliens 
despite the magnitude of the haul police commissioner benjamin 
ward said losing the money would barely cause a ripple in cartel 
operations and stressed that even record seizures would not solve 
the drug problem 
there are still three more legs on the table that have to be 
addressed and they are cutting demand giving treatment on demand 
to addicts and prevention through education 
the cash haul resulted from intensive surveillance by a task 
force made up of members of the dea city and state police in which 
they concentrated on activities at the warehouse 
those arrested were identified as carlos earnesto restrepo 30 
of texas jose rivera 29 of great neck ny omar ospina 38

greg epker knows how his wife killed their 
four children and herself but he doesnt know why and authorities 
say he likely never will 
the family had some financial problems but chances are pretty 
strong the motive will never surface said sheriff robert nall 
hes completely mystified he cant understand it either 
nall said of epker who was hospitalized for shock after he 
discovered the grisly scene upon returning to the family home from 
his job at a sign company in nearby quincy 
police pieced together the chain of events on thursday a day 
after the murdersuicide rocked this western illinois town of 1000 
in the rolling farm country about 140 miles northwest of st louis 
first sheila epker drowned her oldest daughter casey 8 in a 
bathtub then she placed pillows and blankets on the kitchen floor 
making beds for her three other children to die in and turned on 
the gas stove 
when the gas proved too slow a method the 27yearold housewife 
marched her children dressed in their sunday best into the 
living room one by one sat them on a couch and shot each in the 
head 
then she too sat on the couch and took her own life with the 
same gun 
nall said mrs epker had no history of mental problems nor had 
she shown any signs of alcohol or drug abuse he acknowledged they 
had financial problems but no more than any other young family 
but the quincy heraldwhig reported thursday that st mary 
hospital had sued the epkers over 3900 in bills accumulated since 
1980 the hospital won the judgment and epkers wages were docked 
dec 28 the newspaper said 
theres a lot of speculation and there are a lot of ways to go 
with it nall said 
neighbors said the family had been in the modest onestory house 
about seven years the house has a neatly kept front yard and a set 
of childrens swings in back they described mrs epker as outwardly 
cheerful but said she had little contact with neighbors 
she would wave or smile but she never came over or had any 
conversations with me said vera oenning who said mrs epker had 
spoken to her only once in seven years though the families lived on 
about 50 yards apart 
the epker children daughters casey 8 shannon 5 and mandy 
2 and 1yearold son lance were sweet cute just as cute as 
buttons said neighbor karen dingerson the oldest one was 
always ushering the others around 
you wonder with such beautiful children and a nice home but 
you never know whats going on behind closed doors whats going on 
in someones mind she said 
all but the eldest child apparently died without a struggle the 
sheriff said mrs epker apparently tried to strangle casey before 
drowning the child in the bathtub nall said 
casey had been a secondgrader at mendon elementary school where 
principal dean herring described her as a little blondeheaded 
girl who always had a smile on her face and usually a kind word to 
say 
her classmates were bewildered herring said adding a 
psychologist was standing by 
i dont see something as tragic as this passing over in a 
couple of days he said its something we will be dealing with 
for a while

libya and the united states disputed each 
others facts honor and circumstances in the downing of two libyan 
jets by us warplanes during a contentious emergency session of the 
un security council 
the two sides are expected to resume their verbal dogfight today 
when the session moves into its second day 
libyan ambassador ali sunni muntasser who sought the urgent 
meeting called the us action a premediated act of aggression 
and a prelude to largescale aggression against economic and 
military installations 
us ambassador herbert s okun told the council the two us 
navy fighter jets that shot down the mig23s over the mediterranean 
on wednesday acted in selfdefense because they faced imminent 
threat of being shot down by the intercepting libyan aircraft 
okun said the united states considers the matter closed 
libya repeated its claim that the jets were unarmed 
reconnaissance planes 
that disputed a pentagon videotape shot from one of the us jets 
showing one libyan plane carrying four missiles the videotape 
released thursday showed the us fighters tried highspeed 
maneuvers five times to avoid the mig planes before they fired 
libya wants the 15member security council the most powerful 
un body to formally condemn the us military action 
on thursday the united states and libya traded charges and six 
other speakers representing the arab league bahrain burkina 
faso cuba syria and tunisia condemned the us action 
however the united states and britain two of five permanent 
members with veto power were expected to kill any resolution of 
condemnation british foreign secretary geoffrey howe said thursday 
that the us account of the clash showed it is clear they acted 
in selfdefense 
the united states britain and france cast vetoes to kill a 
condemnation in the council of the april 1986 us air raid against 
libya in benghazi and tripoli about 100 people were killed in the 
attack including the daughter of libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
the other permanent council members are china and the soviet 
union whose foreign ministry spokesman gennedy i gerasimov 
sharply criticized the us attack as a show of state terrorism 
other members of the security council are algeria brazil 
canada colombia ethiopia finland malaysia nepal senegal and 
yugoslavia 
soviet ambassador alexander m belonogov told reporters the 
soviet union had warned the united states before thursdays attack 
not to escalate tensions with libya over an alleged libyan chemical 
weapons plant 
we gave a warning signal to washington to show restraint in 
that area belonogov said not to raise the tension in the area 
we were concerned by this us antilibyan campaign in connection 
with a socalled chemical weapons plant 
belongov urged the united states to consider libyas offer of 
inspection of the plant 60 miles southwest of tripoli the libyan 
capital the united states says such an inspection would be 
inconclusive because the plant could be quickly dismantled and the 
offending materials hidden 
libya claims the plant is only for the manufacturing of 
pharmaceuticals but the united states and britain say it is intended 
to produce chemical weapons and is ready to go on line 
us officials have denied any connection between the air action 
and allegations about the chemical plant 
okun the acting permanent us representative said when it 
comes to a choice beween the word of the libyans and the word of the 
united states i think the world knows whose word to accept 
in washington the reagan administration has made no final 
decision about whether to attack the plant but pentagon contingency 
plans suggest the firstever use of cruise missiles with nonnuclear 
warheads sources say 
the sources said use of the unmanned tomahawk cruise missile is 
a preferred contingency because no pilots would be involved and 
because of the missiles accuracy

large air transport planes will be required 
within three years to install systems which will automatically warn 
a pilot of an impending collision with another aircraft according 
to regulations issued by the federal aviation administration 
ending years of research and controversy the faa on thursday 
issued the requirement that all commercial jetliners with 30 or more 
seats have the device traffic alert and collision avoidance system 
known as tcas ii by dec 30 1991 
in addition turbinepowered commuter aircraft with 10 to 30 
passenger seats must carry a less sophisticated collision system 
known as tcas i within six years the system alerts pilots to 
potential collisions but does not provide them with avoidance 
maneuvers as does tcas ii 
transportation secretary jim burnley in making the tcas ii 
announcement thursday said the new rule will be one of the most 
significant safety initiatives in recent years it will provide an 
added margin of safety for the flying public this equipment will 
provide pilots with an independent backup to the safety services 
which they already receive from the air traffic control system 
for some time the faa has let it be known it was preparing such 
a requirement several airlines have been using operational tcas 
units on a test basis on a small number of planes for more than a 
year 
the faa and industry have been testing various versions of a 
collision avoidance system since the mid1970s and the government 
announced in l981 that it would pursue development of the socalled 
tcas system for use by commercial jetliners 
the agency estimates the rule will affect 3364 existing us 
commercial airplanes and an additional 3100 airplanes that are 
expected to be added to the airline fleets by the year 2003 the 
cost to the airlines of equipping these aircraft is put at 8063 
million according to the faa 
the tcas system installed in the cockpit alerts a pilot if 
there is another aircraft in the vicinity and on a potential 
collision course 
a computer analyzes the flight path of both aircraft and if the 
potential for a collision increases a computerized voice advises 
the pilot whether to climb or descend to avoid the other 
plane 
the system works only if the second aircraft has a similar system 
or a socalled modec transponder which provides altitude 
information although many private airplanes do not have a modec 
transponder the faa requires such equipment in most airspace used 
by commercial jetliners 
airline pilots have supported development of a collision 
avoidance system but the pilots union has not favored the tcas 
system being required by the faa 
the 40000member air line pilots association has pushed for 
development of a more sophisticated system that would give not only 
descend and climb directions but also direction to turn left or 
right to avoid a collision 
the faa however decided not to require the more sophisticated 
system which has not been fully tested as yet in order to speed up 
installation of the devices

the debate between the united states and libya over 
an alleged chemical weapons plant may overshadow a 140nation 
conference on the use of poison gas and other chemical arms such 
weapons have been called a poor nations atomic bomb 
secretary of state george p shultz and a libyan delegate plan to 
attend the opening session saturday and tension is expected 
foreign minister roland dumas of france said his government hopes 
the fiveday conference will not deviate from its agenda because 
of the shooting down wednesday of two libyan jet fighters by us 
navy planes 
delegates are expected to discuss changes in the 1925 geneva 
protocol prohibiting the use of poison gas and other chemical 
weapons the document does not forbid making the weapons and has no 
enforcement provisions 
with their effectiveness relative economy and ease of 
production such weapons are feared because they greatly increase 
the killing power of smaller less armed countries 
many countries want to give the protocol teeth and spur 
negotiations on a treaty banning production of chemical arms they 
include the united states and soviet union the only two countries 
that admit having the weapons 
both french and us officials indicated they would honor a 
gentlemens agreement against namecalling at the conference 
the united states has been vocal in the weeks before the 
conference about what is says is a big chemical weapons plant libya 
has built south of tripoli and is ready to go online libya says 
the factory only manufactures pharmaceuticals 
president reagan refused to rule out military action against the 
plant at rabta washington said wednesdays air action over the 
mediterranean was not related to the allegations 
but shultz said wednesday that the united states may not have to 
level the plant if libya is willing to work out a deal 
whether there is something else that can be done well see 
he told reporters on a flight to paris from washington he did not 
elaborate 
the private stockholm international peace research institute says 
at least 10 countries are reliably reported to have chemical 
weapons the united states says about 20 either have produced the 
weapons or are capable of doing so 
iraqs use of mustard gas in its eightyear war with iran and 
charges that it used poison gas last fall on rebellious iraqi kurds 
have kindled public interest in chemical weapons 
reagan proposed the conference in his address to the un general 
assembly in september france as official keeper of the 1925 geneva 
protocol offered to be host for the meeting 
president francois mitterrand will give the opening address when 
the conference convenes at the headquarters of the un educational 
scientific and cultural organization un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar also will speak 
french officials emphasized the conference is diplomatic in 
nature and will end with a final communique that has no legal 
weight but both washington and moscow want action 
the united states wants to enhance the un secretarygenerals 
role in investigating allegations of chemical weapons use it also 
will urge industrialized nations to deny such technology to libya 
and approve economic sanctions on those who help proliferate use of 
the weapons 
soviet officials seek an agreement requiring all nations 
including the superpowers to destroy existing chemical weapons over 
a 10year period 
mitterrand also has urged a sanctioning role for the united 
nations he also has called for an embargo on deliveries of products 
and technologies involved in the manufacture of chemical weapons and 
a further embargo on all arms to nations in question 
the protocol is a onepage document with 118 signatories that has 
long been considered inadequate the geneva conference on chemical 
weapons which would ban use production and stockpiling has 
languished for nearly a decade

workers at a company repeatedly cited 
for illegally dumping chemicals released a cloud of deadly chlorine 
gas when they failed to tighten a valve forcing 11500 people to 
evacuate officials said 
three firefighters were injured and massive traffic jams snarled 
this los angeles suburb before authorities capped the leak and 
lifted the evacuation order thursday evening more than 11 hours 
after the gas was first reported 
we dont expect any major injuries or deaths ventura county 
fire department spokeswoman susan chandler said 
the chlorine escaped from a 5000gallon tank at the travelin 
west textile co and formed a greenishyellow cloud over an area as 
big as six football fields on the outskirts of this city of 100000 
people 
the gas forms an acid in your lungs that creates blisters and 
you could die said fire department spokesman kevin nester 
battalion chief larry whelan said workers drained the tank of all 
but 20 to 50 gallons of liquid chlorine on tuesday but instead of 
tightening the valve with a wrench they only handtightened it 
the chlorine used to treat the plants wastewater before 
disposal turns into a gas when released into the air 
deputy city manager jay corey said the city had fought travelin 
west for two years over its dumping of dyes and other chemicals in 
city sewers 
he said the city cited the company several times in 1987 and 1988 
for illegal dumping and then sought a court injunction the city 
recently won a ceaseanddesist order requiring travelin west to 
stop discharging dyes and chemicals into the sewers by jan 1 he 
said 
two weeks ago travelin west informed the city it would close 
the plant and move corey said authorities believe the firm was 
shutting down its operation he said but it was unclear whether the 
chlorine tank was emptied earlier this week as part of that move 
late thursday city officials obtained a temporary restraining 
order barring any plant employee from entering the building until an 
investigation can be completed 
travelin west officials did not immediately answer telephone 
calls and could not be located by city officials 
after the leak was discovered firefighters directed a 
highpressure 80foot stream of water on the tank that caked the 
loose valve with ice and temporarily sealed the leak that allowed 
the cloud to dissipate and enabled firefighters to tighten the 
valve whelan said 
just after dark a specially outfitted hazardousmaterials squad 
was able to tighten the leaking valve on the tank they got a big 
wrench and tightened the valve said whelan as a precaution the 
valve was then capped he added 
whelan estimated 11500 people were ordered to evacuate offices 
and homes in a fivesquaremile area after the leak was reported at 
740 am rail traffic through simi valley also was halted 
the gas settled in a huge cloud over the northwest part of the 
city not far from the 100acre foothill site where the 60 million 
reagan library is to be built the cloud spread slowly during the 
day covering an area 100 feet by 600 yards by late afternoon said 
ms chandler 
an evacuation center at royal high school had to be abandoned as 
the evacuation area grew the center was moved to simi valley high 
school several miles east of the trouble zone where red cross 
volunteers set up the gymnasium for 2000 people 
people were allowed to return to the area at 7 pm producing 
more huge traffic jams in this city 40 miles northwest of los 
angeles 
two members of the fire departments hazardous materials team 
were treated at a hospital and released while a third member was 
kept for observation officials said 
one of the most common chemicals in the united states chlorine 
is used to kill bacteria in swimming pools and drinking water 
supplies as a bleaching agent in paper and textile manufacturing 
and as a building block in manufacturing other chemicals

libya reportedly is moving its jet fighters to desert 
oases and posting machine gun nests around public buildings saying 
the united states plans an attack to follow up on its downing of two 
libyan planes 
the rome newspaper il messaggero reported from tripoli on 
thursday that libyan fighter jets were transferred inland from 
coastal bases some as far south as the heart of the sahara desert 
to be out of range of possible attack by us naval forces in the 
mediterranean 
an italian in tripoli said by telephone that the capitals 
streets were calm but that public buildings were fortified with 
machine gun posts one day after us jets shot down two libyan mig 
fighters over the mediterranean 
soldiers stood in for traffic police in the streets the yugoslav 
news agency tanjug said 
the government refused entry to 30 foreign journalists at tripoli 
airport thursday and an aide at the information ministry indicated 
the 200 journalists now in libya also may be asked to leave 
the libyan government newspaper alfajr eljadid on thursday said 
the shooting clearly demonstrates that the united states intends 
to attack libya the united states fleet in the mediterranean is 
there to attack libya and the attack against our airplanes is 
evidence of this 
the reagan administration said libya was lying when it claimed 
the planes were unarmed reconnaissance aircraft pentagon spokesman 
dan howard said photos from an american jet showed one of the 
fighters carried four missiles 
a us videotape of the incident released thursday showed the 
us fighters tried highspeed maneuvers five times to avoid the mig 
planes before they fired

statements by thursday evening on wednesday the libyan leader 
denounced the incident as american terrorism and vowed to meet 
challenge with challenge 
on thursday libyan officials promised western journalists who 
arrived earlier in tripoli a visit to a plant that the us 
administration charges was built recently to manufacture chemical 
weapons gadhafi insists the plant is a pharmaceutical factory 
by evening the promised visit to the site in rabta 60 miles 
southwest of tripoli had not materialized 
syrias health minister mohammed ayad chatti who said he 
visited the plant recently told reporters the facility was a 
small factory not hightech and that it manufactures medicine 
asked about reports it was ringed with missiles and artillery he 
replied thats because it cost a lot 
wednesdays attack was the second us strike against libyan 
targets in less than two years 
the united states bombed libya in april 1986 for suspected libyan 
involvement in a west berlin disco frequented by us servicemen 
libyas official media said palestinian leader col saeed mousa 
arrived in tripoli on wednesday night and issued a statement 
supporting libya after the us action 
mousa also known as abu mousa leads the fatahuprising faction 
which is backed by syria it broke with yasser arafat chairman of 
the palestine liberation organization in 1983 
on wednesday night libyan media reported a message of solidarity 
from ahmed jibril who leads the popular front for the liberation of

african students in beijing today demanded china 
release three africans being held in nanking and boycotted classes 
for a third day 
the students also called on china to change the way it spells the 
word africa because the chinese characters have a bad meaning and 
called for a public apology from chinese students who participated 
in antiblack demonstrations 
we want freedom for our brothers in nanking said one student 
from mali 
a snowstorm delayed the flight of a group of african diplomats 
heading from the capital to the eastern city of nanking for talks 
with african students and chinese officials 
on thursday an official report said the three african students 
held by police following a brawl in nanking that triggered racial 
unrest in four cities admitted they broke the law 
one of the three remained under arrest and apparently faced a 
trial while the two others were being punished with 15 days of 
disciplinary detention the xinhua news agency said 
a fourth african student detained by nanking police was released 
thursday it said 
students contacted in nanking questioned the truth of the xinhua 
report it is very easy for the chinese to put words in peoples 
mouths especially when they are in jail and cannot speak for 
themselves said carl ameho a student from ghana 
on thursday about 45 african students held 10 days at a guest 
house following the christmas eve brawl returned to hehai 
university the scene of the fight 
they were among 140 students mostly from africa who tried to 
flee to beijing in the face of the chinese protests last week but 
were taken by police to the guest house 
the four were taken into custody saturday by about 400 police 
who according to students and african diplomats used electric 
cattle prods and wooden clubs on the students chinese officials 
deny any violence was used 
the trouble began christmas eve in nanking when chinese 
gatekeepers refused to allow two chinese women to attend an african 
student party 
xinhua said alex dosoo of ghana beat a university worker during 
the fight he was the only african formally arrested 
it said alpha robinson of gambia and dossoumou boni lodovic of 
benin tried to stir up trouble during the brawl and were given 
15 days detention all three admitted that they broke the law it 
said 
hanson ebenezer ekow of ghana was released xinhua said hehai 
university said all four were expelled from the school 
a student from ghana said the xinhua report distorted the 
incident 
he said that when he went down to the universitys main gate to 
see why his friends werent being allowed in a group of chinese 
attacked him 
they began beating me said the student who spoke on 
condition of anonymity alex and the others came down to save me 
it was selfdefense 
african students said that on their first day back chinese 
students at hehai yelled black devil youve returned and 
black devil get lost 
ameho said most of the students still want to leave nanking 
racial incidents also have occurred in hangzhou and wuhan 
in beijing several hundred african students at the beijing 
languages institute continued their class boycott prompted by 
chinese allegations that a black student accosted a chinese woman in 
her room 
the student from mali who spoke on condtion of anonymity said 
the students also want china to change the way its spells africa 
other areas of the world have nicer names 
africa is called feizhou in chinese which means literally 
the bad continent america for example is called meiguo or 
the beautiful country 
china denies charges of racial prejudice and expresses 
solidarity with the third world in giving scholarships to african 
students there are about 1500 african students from 40 nations in 
china 
social contacts between african men and chinese women are a 
frequent source of tension

a 9yearold girl threatened with eviction 
from an adultonly condominium since her mother died last year will 
be allowed to remain at least two more months the condo board has 
ruled 
eviction proceedings were scheduled to begin against jamie swartz 
on jan 10 but the viewpointe condominium board ruled thursday the 
girl can stay while the ramifications of a new federal housing act 
are researched 
it must be similar to what someone on death row must feel 
said jill swartz jamies stepmother its not over yet its just 
a reprieve until they find something else to throw at us 
the fair housing amendment act which takes effect march 12 bans 
age discrimination in housing with the exception of subsidized 
facilities for the elderly or in complexes where all occupants are 
62 years old or above or if 80 percent of the units have one 
resident at least 55 years old 
the board is not clear if the viewpointe condos fulfill the age 
exemptions said douglas neway attorney for the condo association 
but the board has scheduled a meeting for jan 10 to vote on a 
proposal to require at least one resident at least 55 years old in 
each unit 
some residents of the condominium who oppose the adultonly rule 
dare seeking to cancel the meeting 
i think if they get the 55 or older thing through theyll be 
right back on jamies case again said marcy esposito 
in a prepared statement neway said the board decided that no 
action would be taken on jamies case at least until the new law 
goes into effect 
jamie moved into the complex with her father lynn and her 
stepmother in april after her 42yearold mother maye swartz was 
hospitalized with cancer the condo board voted in july to allow 
jamie to stay until her mother finished chemotherapy mrs swartz 
died in september 
the board threatened to seek eviction in november but it allowed 
the girl to remain through the holidays provided the twobedroom 
condo was placed on the market 
the couple said there have been few buyers interested in the 
condo purchased three years ago for about 50000

three armenian prosecutors have been fired and 
several others disciplined for failure to halt ethnic violence 
between armenians and azerbaijanis pravda said today 
four prosecutors received strong reprimands and the armenian 
prosecutors committee of peers recommended a fifth resign at the 
end of his term pending conclusion of an investigation into 
murders in the gugar region the official communist party 
newspaper reported 
pravda did not elaborate on those murders and it gave no 
specific allegations against the prosecutors 
but the newspaper did charge that illegal activities of armenian 
activists in the karabakh committee often went unpunished 
all of the disciplined prosecutors have armenian names 
armenian activists have been pressuring authorities to transfer 
the largely armenian area of nagornokarabakh from azerbaijan to 
armenia to protect residents against alleged discrimination 
pravda said unsanctioned rallies inflamed passions and led to mob 
violence the prosecutors panel found that concessions made by 
local government and factory leaders to karabakh committee activists 
contributed to the danger the newspaper said 
as passions mounted the prosecutors and internal affairs 
police officials began to lose control over events and failed to 
ensure law and order public safety and observance of the 
constitution pravda said 
the prosecutors panel said all prosecutors in the southern 
republic which also was ravaged last month by an earthquake that 
killed 55000 people should rectify the gross mistakes 
miscalculations and shortcomings in their work and prevent further 
ethnic clashes

the answer is dick thomas a former fish 
and wildlife technician with the state department of environmental 
conservation 
the question who spurred dozens of media mavens including tvs 
jeopardy to seek the answer to the timehonored question how 
much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood 
thomas came up with an answer 700 pounds to the woodchuck 
riddle during some idle moments last june in the intervening six 
months his little joke has popped up all over america 
last week it popped up on the tv game show jeopardy which 
provides contestants with answers and asks them to pose the matching 
question 
the phone at thomas home in the upstate town of caledonia 
immediately started ringing with calls from friends who wanted to be 
sure he knew what happened but thomas was nonplussed by the 
attention hes used to it now 
ive got my woodchuck file right here thomas said thursday 
it would be a lot bigger but i didnt start keeping it right 
away 
the file includes stories from papers all over the country their 
interest perked up after thomas wrote to fin fur and feather facts 
a normally sober department of conservation newsletter last june 
its high time someone provided an answer to this question 
he wrote 
thomas described woodchucks and their burrows computed volumes 
and weights and ended next time someone asks you tell him 
oh about 700 pounds on a good day with the wind at his back then 
say everybody knows that 
the wall street journal which thomas said called him three times 
to get the woodchuck facts straight provided him with an idea for 
another project determining how many peppers peter piper picked

members of the classy woodlands club 
where it costs 12500 just to join have been admonished to cut out 
the food fights or risk getting kicked out 
some of our members have never been in a club before and dont 
know the protocol manager phil swett said trying to explain why 
the club at times resembles animal house more than lifestyles 
of the rich and famous 
to set the unruly straight swett mailed the 630 members a letter 
detailing offensive behavior that has been observed at the 10 
million sports recreation and housing complex that opened last 
august in this wealthy town north of portland 
among the distasteful behavior cited in swetts letter 
parents sitting idly by while their children throw food around 
the dining room some families swett said have left their dining 
table with food literally covering the floor 
parents leaving soiled baby diapers around the club and making 
no effort to clean up accidents 
in addition to the 12500 initiation fee members pay a 2500 
annual fee and must spend at least 800 a year on food and drinks at 
the club

secretary of state george p shultz indicated the 
united states may be willing to work out a deal with libya that 
would not require the destruction of a plant said to be on the verge 
of full production of poison gas 
shultz said thursday en route to paris for an international 
conference on chemical weapons that he also will make a fresh 
attempt this weekend to persuade the soviet union to help close down 
the libyan plant outside tripoli 
they the soviets are very concerned about the problem 
shultz said they were very quick to endorse the idea of this 
conference 
shultz has already discussed the libyan plant with shevardnadze 
the first time a us official said was when they both attended a 
un general assembly session in new york in late september the 
second occasion was soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs visit 
last month to new york 
shultz said the united states has given the soviets some of the 
information that led us analysts to be quite comfortable about 
accusing libya of being ready to begin chemical weapons production 
but he said so far as i know we have not convinced them 
shultz planned meetings today with president francois mitterrand 
and prime minister michel rocard canadian foreign minister joe 
clark and egyptian foreign minister esmet abdelmeguid 
shultz said thursday on his flight from washington that the 
united states supports the destruction of the rabta facility to 
take care of the problem but hinted the dispute might be resolved 
without leveling the facility 
whether there is something else that can be done well see 
shultz said without elaborating 
shultz acknowledged some of americas best friends are not 
convinced the plant 60 miles southwest of tripoli is a weapons 
facility britain however said it has conclusive independent 
information the plant about to go on line is involved in chemical 
weapons production 
the libyan leader col moammar gadhafi has offered a onetime 
inspection of the plant that he says produces pharmaceuticals 
the state department rejected the offer saying the facility 
could be easily changed to omit the chemical weapons production 
items then put back into production after the inspectors leave 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher says he is 
very concerned about us allegations that west german companies 
had helped libya build the plant 
the west german foreign ministry announced that its ambassador to 
libya juergen helner has asked gadhafi to accept international 
inspection of the plant 
the forceful us condemnation of the facility which began more 
than two months ago has prompted speculation that the united states 
might attack rabta as it did tripoli in 1986 after accusing libya 
in the bombing of a west german nightclub 
president reagans public refusal to rule out the military option 
and the us downing wednesday of two libyan jet fighters over the 
mediterranean fueled the speculation further 
companies in about a halfdozen industrialized countries are 
suspected of assisting libya the state department has urged them to 
desist as a result shultz said chemical weapons have not been 
produced at rabta 
they are not there yet shultz said they have had some 
difficulties 
the conference of 140 nations opens saturday

through a death chamber window he was declared dead at 1209 am 
mercer 44 had been on death row at the missouri state 
penitentiary longer than any other inmate and his efforts to stop 
the execution failed thursday when the us supreme court and gov

then he shook my hand and thanked me and he asked that we look 
out for one of his shipmates down here referring to a fellow 
inmate

about 30 death penalty opponents held a service at a church and 
about a dozen went to the maximumsecurity prison for a candlelight

passengers would be well advised to 
carry a tape measure when they hail a danish taxi because some 
unscrupulous cabbies are driving with undersized tires to cheat the 
meter reports said today 
copenhagens taxi registration branch has discovered cab owners 
have equipped their vehicles with tires that are smaller than the 
size approved for their cars an the result is the meter runs five 
to 12 percent too fast 
this means that in a normal operating period of two years and 
155000 miles the tire change can yield up to 100000 kroner or 
14300 in extra fares the jyllandsposten newspaper said 
police while declaring the tire changing trick to be illegal 
say they lack the manpower to check tires on all taxis after an 
initial inspection 
we control in most cases only that the taxi meter is correctly 
adjusted this is a guarantee that the tires were legal at the time 
of inspection but thats all it does motor vehicle inspector 
nyegaard jensen was quoted as saying

a saudi arabian tanker broke in two today 
and its stern section sank after a mystery blast believed to have 
been caused by a drifting mine left six crewmen dead authorities 
said 
shipping executives speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
greek captain of the 36904ton sagheera was among those killed in 
the explosion in the southern end of the gulf thursday two other 
men were listed as missing 
they said 26 members of the crew made up of greek officers and 
sri lankan seamen were rescued thursday from lifeboats by the omani 
coast guard 
the sagheera was ripped by an explosion as it was sailing empty 
into the stormwhipped strait of hormuz gateway to the persian 
gulf en route for the saudi port of mina saud the blast started a 
fire aboard the tanker 
shipping sources said the vessel later split in two and that one 
of two salvage tugs that went to aid the blazing tanker was towing 
the bow section in the gulf of oman toward the omani coast 
the londonbased lloyds shipping intelligence unit which 
monitors shipping traffic around the world reported an explosion in 
the tankers pumproom before it caught fire 
it did not say what could have caused the blast but us navy 
officers have been warning for weeks that winter storms could tear 
mines laid during the iraniraq war loose from their moorings 
leaving them to drift into shipping lanes 
winds were gusting at more than 30 miles an hour in the gulf 
thursday with waves as high as 30 feet 
the us navy has estimated as many as 200 mines were still 
believed to be in the gulf mainly in northern waters despite 
minesweeping operations by the us and other navies in the 
strategic waterway 
several vessels were hit by mines during the iraniraq conflict 
before fighting was halted aug 20 when a united nationssponsored 
ceasefire took effect 
no ship has been confirmed to have hit a mine since the 
ceasefire began 
the sagheera was one of more than 500 ships attacked during the 
socalled tanker war an offshoot of the gulf conflict in which 
both sides raided merchant vessels in the waterway 
the saudi vessel was hit by iranian gunboats april 4 last year 
but suffered only minor damage and none of its crewmen was hurt it 
was not known whether the sagheera was manned by the same crew

emperor hirohitos blood pressure worsened today and 
physicians expressed concern about possible damage to his brain and 
organs because of lack of oxygen palace officials said 
the 87yearold monarchs blood pressure stood at 68 over 30 late 
today while his breathing rate which increased significantly to 32 
breaths per minute early today eased to 26 in the evening palace 
officials said 
his systolic or upper blood pressure reading has been in the 
6080 range since early thursday despite court physicians efforts 
to push it up with emergency transfusions 
it was longest that his pressure has been below 90 since he fell 
seriously ill on sept 19 
an average systolic or upper blood pressure reading is about 
120 and a sustained low reading can damage the brain and internal 
organs because of the lack of oxygen flowing to them 
it is unlikely that his blood pressure will recover 
significantly considering his failing health said a palace 
official speaking on condition of anonymity doctors dont seem 
to be concerned about the low blood pressure so much as long as it 
stays above 70 
imperial household agency spokesman kenji maeda attributed the 
continuous low blood pressure to the weakening of hirohitos overall 
condition 
his overall condition appears to be weakening he said his 
kidney and other organ functions may have been affected slightly 
hirohito dischaged a small amount of blood this afternoon maeda 
said 
but he stressed that the worlds longest reigning monarch 
remained clearly conscious and his condition was not yet 
critical 
maeda said doctors applied an oxygen mask to the emperor to help 
his respiration but he tried to brush the mask away 
transfusions have been a common method of treatment since the 
emperor fell ill 3 months ago and as of thursday evening he has 
received 6783 pints of blood 
doctors believe the internal bleeding originated in the upper 
intestinal region where hirohito underwent a bypass surgery in 
september 1987 
the palace has not confirmed newspapers and magazines reports 
that the emperor has pancreatic cancer 
crown prince akihito 55 the emperors elder son and heir to the 
throne has assumed the full roster of imperial duties like signing 
government documents since hirohito fell seriously ill

israeli officials have called for an 
investigation of reports that body parts from nazi victims are being 
used in german universities for medical experiments 
the officials called on west germany to open an investigation 
after the reports appeared this week on west germanys ard 
television network israels state tv and in the daily newspaper 
maariv 
foreign ministry spokesman alon liel expressed outrage thursday 
saying we have heard about it only from the media and it sounds 
shocking 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs spokesman avi pazner said its 
the kind of story that you must thoroughly look into because of all 
the implications yitzhak arad director of yad vashem israels 
holocaust memorial said he called wilhelm haas west germanys 
ambassador in israel when he heard of the report 
he said he had heard about it and asked his government for 
details even before i called arad said 
arad said he was shocked and hurt by the news that the 
remains of nazi victims were being used as medical specimens 
they were victims murdered by the nazis and now they are used 
for experiments he said this can not continue 
i am sure that professors and probably the students knew what 
they were using he said but it was in their interest to hide 
the truth i am now sure there will be an end to it 
maariv said thursday an investigation had been ordered by the 
government of the german state of baden wuerttenberg where two 
universities that allegedly are using body parts of nazi victims are 
located 
it is clear that if these facts are true it is not possible 
for these organs and tissues to be used as teaching aids a 
spokesman for baden wuerttenberg told maariv 
maariv and israel tv said body parts from nazi victims including 
communists and the mentally handicapped are used for medical 
education at heidelberg and tuebingen universities 
harry wall director of the antidefamation league of bnai 
brith said its frightening irony that a country where doctors 
used live victims for medical experiments may be using the remnants 
of those victims for medical research 
maariv reported wednesday that during the nazi era the director 
of a research institute in germany personally selected mentally 
retarded people for the gas chamber so he could use their brains for 
experiments 
he succeeded in gathering a special collection that included 
697 fresh brains that were passed on to the university of 
frankfurt benno muellerhill of cologne university was quoted as 
saying by maariv he said the brains were still used today in 
universities 
israel tv said more than 1000 bodies were sent to german 
universities for medical education during the nazis 12year rule 
the report described specific cases involving political prisoners 
but did not document any cases involving jewish holocaust victims 
one german professor supported the use of body parts from nazi 
victims telling israel tv they were of a higher quality than 
samples now available 
especially at our university these samples are very valuable 
for teaching said ulrich drews a professor at tuebingen 
university 
they were prepared in an almost artistic manner the 
quality of the samples can hardly be matched today drews said

two new studies say warnings on cigarette 
advertisements dont work as they should in most cases because 
people dont read them 
people dont pay much attention to the words in the ads they 
look at the pictures said dr paul fischer an associate 
professor of family medicine at the medical college of georgia 
fischer conducted one of the studies which were reported in 
todays journal of the american medical association 
congress passed a law in 1965 requiring the us surgeon 
generals warnings about the hazards of smoking to be put on 
cigarette packages and advertisements the warnings began appearing 
in 1972 after the tobacco industry and the federal trade commission 
reached an agreement on the wording 
fischer used video equipment to monitor how 61 georgia teenagers 
moved their eyes across cigarette ads in magazines the teenagers 
were paid for taking part in the study he said 
equipment problems meant data could be taken from only 45 of the 
subjects ages 13 to 17 who viewed a total of 202 advertisements 
fischer said 
but in 436 percent of the viewings he said the teenagers did 
not see the warnings on the ads 
a marketing research executive commissioned by the tobacco 
institute a washingtonbased trade association that represents 
major cigarette manufacturers contended the study was flawed 
they should have used a minimum of 150 to 200 people for the 
study and it should have been a representative sample in order to 
get true results said elliot young president of perceptions 
research services inc an englewood cliffs nj market research 
firm 
fischers study drew a distinction between looking and 
reading and defined reading as a situation in which the eye was 
fixed on the ad for at least 01 seconds 
after viewing the advertisements the teenagers were asked to 
choose the five warnings that were in the ads from a list of 10 
possible choices 
another study conducted by dr ronald davis director of the 
office on smoking and health for the federal centers for disease 
control in atlanta found that while people were able to clearly 
read cigarette ads on street and highway billboards and on taxis 
they had trouble making out the warnings 
his study used two nonsmoking cdc workers in atlanta and two 
nonsmoking new york city health department workers as viewers 
in atlanta under average driving conditions the two cdc workers 
in a moving car were able to read the brand name of a cigarette 
advertised on street billboards after viewing them for 3 seconds 
but in 18 cases they were unable to read the warning against smoking 
and in 27 cases they were able to make out only part of it the 
study said 
on highway billboards the cdc observers were able to read the 
brand name in the ad in all 39 cases but were able to completely 
read the warnings in only two of the incidents the study said the 
warnings were partially read in six of the viewings 
two viewers who saw 100 ads on taxis in new york city from a 
sidewalk bench were unable to read any warnings even though they 
could read the brand name in every case the study found

china today said its 1988 grain harvest fell for 
the fourth straight year putting in danger the nations ability to 
feed its 108 billion people 
the official china daily blamed the shortfall on one of the worst 
droughts in chinas history and lack of motivation by peasants 
to plant more grain the central bank said it would lend 232 
billion to the agricultural bank officials have said greater state 
investment is needed to increase yields 
the state statistical bureau said 39379 million tons of rice 
corn wheat and other grains were harvested last year down from 
1987s 40298 million tons and only slightly higher than 1985 and 
1986 harvests 
china produced a record 407 million tons of grain in 1984 but has 
been unable since to match it premier li peng has said china needs 
to produce 500 million tons per year by the year 2000 in order to 
keep up with population growth 
chinas goal had been to produce 450 million tons in 1990 but 
the official china daily said this will be almost impossible 
the newspaper said prolonged drought in many areas of the country 
and typhoons and floods in other places were partly to blame for 
1988s poor results 
however it also blamed a lack of motivation for peasants to 
increase production 
the paper quoted the state statistical bureau as saying the 
amount of land used to grow grain fell in 1988 because peasants made 
bigger profits from raising crops such as melons and vegetables for 
sale to cities 
grain production is a highly political issue in a country that 
only recently has been able to feed its fastgrowing population 
emphasis on grain as the key link in the economy remains central 
to the ruling communist partys program failure to promote grain 
production cost officials their jobs 
over the last decade however state investment has gone heavily 
to industry and infrastructure development at the expense of 
agriculture because it had bettter prospects for profit 
the china daily said the peoples bank of china the central 
bank had agreed to give the agricultural bank the extra money in 
1989 for investment in farm projects 
it quoted agricultural bank officials as saying they planned to 
increase their farm credit fund by 48 billion including the 
central bank contribution and were considering raising the rest of 
the money by issuing bonds

tugboattanker collision that one official said could scar the coast 
for months if not years 
as experts assessed the ecological damage to the pacific 
northwest shell oil co estimated thursday that a ruptured pipeline 
in missouri spilled 840000 gallons of oil dec 24 near a tributary 
of the missouri river in one of the biggest inland spills in us 
history 
shell has recovered about 441000 gallons company spokesman tony 
canino said 
the state of missouri is probably headed for legal action 
against shell for not notifying officials immediately after 
discovering the rupture a spokesman for the state department of 
natural resources said 
in northwest washington experts hiked along the shoreline of 
olympic national park thursday to assess damage to fragile 
tidepools kelp beds rocky shores and wildlife from an estimated 
231000 gallons of bunker oil the oil spilled after the dec 22 
collision of a tugboat and a tanker in heavy seas two miles off 
grays harbor on the central washington coast 
olympic chief ranger chuck janda said a damage assessment should 
be ready by saturday 
evidence of the spill which has washed up along 300 miles of 
coast from newport ore to vancouver island british columbia 
will remain a long long time months if not years he said 
tides and heavy surf appear to be gradually shifting the oil 
northward janda said 
state wildlife officials say about 3700 sea birds have died in 
washington with no estimates immediately available from oregon or 
british columbia janda said contaminated birds still were being 
found 
volunteers had cleaned 890 birds and released 42 by late 
thursday said susan ewing of the state department of wildlife 
among the species hardest hit have been murres auklets scoters 
loons and grebes officials said 
many beaches along the rugged coast are accessible only by 
helicopter or on foot at low tide janda said cleanup crews are 
using choppers to haul out 20000 pounds of oilsoaked sand kelp 
driftwood and other material daily the cleanup could continue for 
several weeks he said 
at canadas pacific rim national park 100 miles to the north on

sause bros ocean towing of coos bay ore owner of the barge 
and tug said the cost of cleanup in washington alone was 10000 a 
day the cost is covered by insurance it said 
shells 840000gallon estimate on the size of the missouri spill 
was the first the company has given it would be on the scale of a 
spill a year ago from an ashland oil co storage tank on the 
monongahela river near pittsburgh which federal officials said then 
was among the nations worst 
published estimates of the monongahela spill have ranged from 
500000 to 1 million gallons 
the oil erupted from a 35foot rupture in a buried pipeline near 
the gasconade river about 140 miles west of st louis oil has 
moved since into the missouri and mississippi rivers

vietnam will withdraw its remaining 
50000 troops from cambodia by september if a political settlement 
to the war is reached cambodian president heng samrin said today 
while it previously did not name a month vietnam has repeatedly 
pledged to withdraw all its troops earlier than its original target 
date of 1990 if a political settlement could be reached 
resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk was quoted as saying 
however that vietnamese pledges of withdrawals are false that 
peace talks have failed and that cambodias future can be settled 
only by continued fighting 
heng samrin made the pullout offer in a speech in cambodias 
capital of phnom penh to mark his governments first decade in 
power vietnam installed the government on jan 7 1979 two weeks 
after launching a fullscale invasion of cambodia 
in the speech broadcast by the official phnom penh radio and 
monitored in bangkok he accused the guerrilla opposition of 
prolonging the peace negotiations by making what he called the 
unreasonable demand that the phnom penh government be dismantled 
before a general election is held 
heng samrin repeated that his government wanted a settlement on 
the basis of a vietnamese withdrawal along with measures to prevent 
the former fanatical khmer rouge regime from retaking power 
he said that to contribute to achieving this solution 
vietnam and his government have agreed if there is a political 
solution all vietnamese troops will be withdrawn from cambodia no 
later than september 1989 all the points above should be 
implemented with effective international control 
heng samrin said his government hopes that other parties will 
keep promises to end aid and sanctuary to the khmer rouge and the 
other guerrilla groups such promises have been made by china which 
arms the guerrillas and by thailand which gives them territory for 
bases 
vietnam claims to have made annual partial withdrawals of its 
troops since 1982 it says the largest came in 1988 when the 
vietnamese military high command all advisers and 50000 soldiers 
returned home vietnam says the remaining 50000 troops will be 
repatriated by 1990 whether there is a political solution or not 
the guerrillas demand that the heng samrin government be 
dismantled has been one of the major barriers in the peace talks 
the major peace forums have been meetings in france between 
cambodias prime minister hun sen and sihanouk and multilateral 
talks the second round of which are scheduled in indonesia next 
month 
the khmer rouge radio said sihanouk on jan 1 sent a note to 
countries backing the resistance telling them that the vietnamese 
troop pullout is not real and not unconditional the radio 
broacast occurred thursday and a text of it was seen in bangkok 
today 
in the note sihanouk said the supposed pullouts were mere 
rotations and about 120000 vietnamese soldiers remained in 
cambodia 20000 of them in the cambodian army also 40000 troops 
in the the cambodian army are vietnamese naturalized as cambodians 
he said in addition nearly 1 million vietnamese colonizers were 
sent to cambodia from 1978 to 1988 he claimed 
the radio said sihanouk further said that this issue can be 
solved one way only and that is through the efforts and sacrifices 
on the battlefield in cambodia by cambodian resistance forces which 
are intensifying their activities against the vietnamese 
aggressors

near the jewish settlement of yakir 25 miles north of jerusalem 
his body was found near there thursday night and a police 
spokesman said he was shot twice in the chest 
police chief haim malka head of the west banks northern

his criminal record was from the 1970s not the 1980s and his 
crimes were not that great

we saw there was blood he didnt say anything he made one 
more hand movement and then nothing mrs scheih said

issued calls for protest demonstrations in this isolated hilltop 
settlement 
residents of the nearby settlement of ariel took to the streets 
early today when they heard the news israel radio reported it said 
the settlers burned a tire in the road and hurled rocks at 
palestinian cars copying the tactics used by arabs in their

villages of kifl harith and deir istiya while searching for 
suspects the radio said it said troops ousted several settlers who 
entered arab villages

transportation was halted in bethlehem and the nearby christian 
villages of beit jalla and beit sahour in compliance with orders for

strike on dec 24 to mark the suffering of palestinians in the 
revolt against israeli rule in the occupied territories 
at least 347 palestinians have been killed in the uprising most 
by army gunfire fourteen israelis also have died in the unrest not

the us ambassador to the 35nation 
helsinki review conference said today the meeting had achieved 
historic agreements on human rights but hungary voiced fears that 
romania could torpedo the accord 
in a surprise move romania on thursday presented the conference 
with 17 suggestions for deleting or changing the draft of a final 
accord 
a western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
romania is seeking to change or delete commitments to religious 
freedom the freedom of movement and clauses on emigration and 
tourism 
hungarys communist party daily nepszabadsag described the 
romanian demands as a diplomatic torpedo that could undo two 
years of hard work in vienna where the 35nation review conference 
opened in november 1986 
the newspaper added however that torpedoes do not always hit 
their traget and there have been instances of their returning to 
where they have been launched 
tensions between hungary and romania have been high for years 
particularly over the plan announced last year by the romanian 
government to raze thousands of ethnic hungarian villages and 
resettle residents in industrial centers 
us ambassador warren zimmermann played down the romanian 
demands over the human rights accord saying they were merely 
suggestions and noting that they had been rejected thursday by 
coordinators responsible for the draft accord 
zimmermann told a news conference that the draft of the final 
accord was an excellent document that needed very few changes to 
be acceptable to the united states 
under the consensus mechanism of the helsinki review process a 
final accord must be approved by all 35 participating nations to 
take effect 
if we are able to achieve it it will be a document that sets a 
really historic set of markers in human rights perhaps the most 
farreaching ever zimmermann said 
the united states britain and canada still seek improvements in 
the accord to guarantee that east bloc citizens can monitor their 
nations human rights and that new soviet laws limiting emigration 
on the ground of state secrecy will not apply to those already 
waiting years to emigrate 
among the achievements of the vienna conference zimmermann 
noted is a mechanism guaranteeing continuous eastwest discussion 
of human rights 
there will be a human rights conference in paris this summer in 
copenhagen in 1990 and in moscow in 1991 
in addition the draft accord entitles states signing the 
helsinki accords to raise any human rights matter with another 
participant at any time 
delegates hope to end the helsinki conference by midjanuary 
paving the way for new eastwest talks on reducing conventional 
forces to begin in vienna in february or march 
negotiators from the 16 nato and seven warsaw pact nations were 
still working today to finish a mandate for those talks by early 
next week 
zimmermann said he expected a lot of quiet diplomacy to try 
to reach an agreement before jan 17 when austria has invited the 
foreign ministers of 34 nonparticipant nations to a threeday 
closing meeting of the helsinki review conference

gov michael s dukakis labeled passionless during 
his failed presidential campaign inspired liberal followers and 
riled conservative critics with a suprisingly vitriolic state of the 
state speech 
dukakis on thursday night lashed out at his opponents as 
gutless wonders and said baloney to those who accuse the 
state of overspending 
republican leaders and conservative democrats said they found 
some of the governors remarks bitter and even tasteless 
all sides agreed that dukakis was signaling his determination to 
push for new taxes when he releases his plan next week to address a 
shortfall of at least 636 million in the states 116 billion 
budget 
despite the budget gap the newly combative dukakis promised 
were going forward not back with investments in the economy 
drugfree schools and the environment 
dukakis 24minute speech broadcast from the house chamber was 
interrupted 21 times for applause the audience included 
legislators state officials and family members 
referring to his critics as the chronic complainers and the 
gloomanddoomers the democratic governor said well i have a 
message for them tonight because they are the gutless wonders of 
massachusetts politics im not going to let them get away with it 
and neither are you 
the statement drew the strongest applause of the night 
two days after his surprise announcement that he would not seek a 
fourth term in 1990 dukakis pledged to fight harder than ever for 
his agenda 
some people may think that over the next two years i intend to 
ride off into the sunset well theyre sadly mistaken he said 
jim braude head of the liberal tax equity alliance for 
massachusetts said he was very encouraged he painted a picture 
of a very compassionate state and said with no equivocation that 
compassion costs money braude said 
rep john flood a conservative democrat who is chairman of the 
taxation committee and who has blamed dukakis for the fiscal 
predicament fumed that the gutless wonders remark was tasteless 
in his speech dukakis briefly mentioned his presidential 
campaign as the adventure of my life and made a veiled reference 
to presidentelect george bush when he said tonight is a night 
for tough talk and no lip reading

there were many dead on the second floor of the headquarters 
building where brig gen eduardo batalla and his chief of staff

batalla and abendan were captured thursday after batalla ordered 
moslem policemen to surrender their weapons and face murder charges 
in a 1984 incident 
house of representatives speaker ramon mitra said the military 
decided to storm the garrison after the policemens leader 
patrolman rizal alih rejected mitras last offer mitra had asked

witnesses said tanks and armored personnel carriers smashed 
through the gates ahead of marines reporters saw captors resist 
with automatic rifles and grenade launchers and at least one 
armored vehicle was disabled by the firing 
reporters said a portion of the building where the hostages were 
held had been destroyed by tank fire

moslem soldiers apparently slipped into the headquarters building 
overnight to join alih and an estimated 15 followers the captors 
demanded to be flown to siasi island 120 miles to the southwest 
mitra said alih reneged on an overnight deal to end the dispute 
in exchange for a safe passage to palawan island where he would 
surrender to military police 
alih was charged in the november 1984 slaying of mayor cesar 
climaco but was acquitted three weeks after climacos death seven

detained by batalla and all of them could be charged with murder or 
conspiracy to commit murder 
military officials claim alih has been operating several illegal 
businesses in the zamboanga area 560 miles south of manila 
about 5 million moslems live in the philippines which has 
population of 59 million about half zamboangas residents are 
christian and half moslem

prosecutors said they will seek fines and 
jail time for two chicago tribune reporters accused of defying a 
judges gag order in publishing the name of a boy accused of 
stabbing three classmates 
circuit judge robert e byrne who issued the gag order declined 
to drop contempt of court charges against reporters joseph sjostrom 
and jan crawford during a hearing thursday but said he would give 
the case to another judge 
assistant states attorney carmen polo said he would seek fines 
and jail sentences if the two are convicted 
byrne had ordered news media not to identify the 14yearold 
charged in the stabbings at a high school dec 7 the tribune had 
published the teenagers name before the judge issued the order and 
published it again the day after the order 
the newspaper said the reporters had obtained the boys name 
after interviewing his mother and students at the school in elmhurst 
truthful information in the public domain cant be made secret 
again by an order said joseph p thornton an attorney for the 
newspaper 
there is an element of waiver when the mother talks to the 
press in detail and gives them the name he said 
he said that the tribune believed the gag order was improper and 
based on an unconstitutional law and that the decision to print the 
name was made by editors

less than six weeks after undergoing a rare 
fiveorgan transplant a 3yearold girl is rejecting the new organs 
and will die without another complete transplant doctors say 
rolandrea dodge of farmington nm became only the second 
person to receive a new liver stomach pancreas small intestine 
and portion of a large intestine in a 16hour operation nov 29 
but dr thomas starzl the transplant pioneer at childrens 
hospital here said thursday the girls immune system was rejecting 
the new organs hospital officials launched a nationwide search for 
another set of donor organs after blood tests and biopsies revealed 
the rejection starzl said 
she is very critically ill rollys only chance for survival is 
with a new set of organs said hospital spokeswoman lynn mcmahon 
the little girl was in intensive care her breathing aided by a 
respirator rolly as she is called by parents cyndi and brandon 
dodge was born with intractable secretory diarrhea an incurable 
disease that prevented her intestines from absorbing food and 
liquids she has spent her life in hospitals getting 21 hours a day 
of highprotein food through intravenous feeding 
four other people in the united states have had multiple 
abdominal organ transplants and all have died three of the cases 
involved fewer than five organs while only one involved five 
doctors are not sure what went wrong with rolly because there are so 
few precedents ms mcmahon said 
doctors are seeing some things and they they are not 
exactly certain what they are they cant say definitely what is 
happening but they can say theyre resulting from the changes in 
her immune system she said 
two of the previous four transplants took place at childrens 
the most recent was tabatha foster 3 of madisonville ky who 
died of a blood infection in may six months after her operation 
tabatha was the only other patient to get five organs 
some of rollys symptoms are different from tabathas ms 
mcmahon said in all of her six months tabatha never exhibited 
any symptoms of rejection 
doctors believe tabathas infection was caused by the amount of 
cyclosporine she received while cyclosporine keeps the bodys 
immune system from rejecting donated organs too much of it can 
leave a patient vulnerable to infections rolly was given less of 
the drug than tabatha

prime minister indira gandhi autorities said 
the executions prompted threats of massacres by sikh militants 
heavilyarmed police and paramilitary units were on alert in the 
capital as well as in punjab and neighboring states of himachal 
pradesh and haryana

innocence and satwant singh said he had no regrets as the nooses

say the faithful god is great said the official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the executions capped four years of legal maneuvering that began 
after mrs gandhi was gunned down oct 31 1984 apparently in 
revenge for an army raid she ordered on the golden temple the 
holiest sikh shrine 
the supreme court on thursday rejected appeals by both men

i could be born again and again and each time lay down my life for 
this 
the bodies of the men were cremated a home ministry official 
said prison officials said the ashes would not be turned over to 
relatives for fear of violence

templo said the military obtained a warrant to search the 
premises after a soldier allegedly involved in the robbery told 
investigators the other suspects were using the marcos house as 
their hideout 
templo who led the raid said the search was hampered because 
electricity in the house was cut off shortly after marcos and his 
family fled to hawaii during the february 1986 civilianmilitary 
uprising that ended his 20year rule he said the search was 
conducted with lights brought by television crews 
looters stripped the house of its furnishings after the marcoses 
fled and only the caretaker and a few security guards occupy the 
house now templo said

federations said the missionaries richard grover 50 of warroad 
minn and roy libby 50 of atlanta were being held by drug 
traffickers who threatened to kill one of them for every colombian 
extradited to the united states to face drug charges 
their kidnappers also have demanded the release of carlos lehder 
rivas an extradited drug kingpin sentenced to life imprisonment 
without parole last year in the united states said pardo 
grover and libby were kidnapped by about 10 men dressed in 
military uniforms as they attended a meeting of evangelists in la 
florida village 180 miles southwest of bogota he said 
the kidnappers came into the meeting and demanded money and 
they didnt have any money to give them so they took the two 
missionaries they authorities havent heard a word since then 
said grovers sister connie wold of thief river falls minn 
ms wold said drug traffickers had threatened her brother before

tighter security measures ordered 
after the bombing of pan am flight 103 took effect today at british 
airports causing some passenger delays while workers closely 
searched carryon baggage 
transport secretary paul channon announced the steppedup 
security thursday after a meeting of the national aviation security 
committee in london 
the new measures are aimed primarily at american carriers and 
passengers faced long lines to have their hand baggage examined 
before boarding pan am and twa flights at londons heathrow airport 
i certainly believe that its best to take a few extra 
precuations and be safe rather than rush things and be sorry 
said lee godman who was traveling to miami 
channon announced thursday immediate further steps to increase 
safety of the security of cargo also mislaid luggage and also to 
take further steps to tighten up the existing regulations on cabin 
bags 
there will be more rigorous searching on american airlines and 
on any airline where we think the threat is commensurate but at the 
moment it will be american airlines he said 
he gave no other details but said he would soon take additional 
measures to increase airline security 
channons announcement came hours after lockerbie buried two 
townspeople killed when wreckage and blazing jet fuel from the new 
yorkbound boeing 747 rained on the southern scottish town dec 21 
the explosion killed all 259 people on the plane and 11 on the 
ground 
londons evening standard newspaper on thursday reported that 
experts probing the crash were concentrating on 12 passengers 
believed to have joined flight 103 in london after arriving from 
airports in the middle east 
the fear is that their baggage checked in as destined for new 
york at airports with much less stringent checks than london may 
have been put on to the doomed jet without further security tests 
the paper said 
there was no official comment on the report from pan am 
the government on thursday announced a 18 million rebuilding 
program in lockerbie where buildings were destroyed by falling 
wreckage and fire 
in the small closeknit town a requiem mass was held thursday 
for one of the victims 10yearold joanne flannigan 
her parents are also counted among lockerbies 11 dead but their 
bodies have not been found 
joanne is survived only by brothers stephen 14 who was fixing 
her bicycle at a neighbors house at the time of the crash and 
david 20 who lives away from home 
later thursday a funeral service was held at all saints 
episcopal church for another victim 81yearold mary lancaster 
searchers have recovered 242 bodies and by thursday night had 
released 164 of them for burial or other funeral arrangements 
officials say they believe some of the 28 still missing may have 
been cremated in the fiery fuelfed crash that left a 30footdeep 
crater in the town

president reagan said today he supports a 50 
percent pay raise for members of congress and other federal 
officials because we must not allow federal service to become the 
province only of the wealthy 
in a letter to the house and senate reagan said he endorsed the 
payraise recommendations of the commission on executive 
legislative and judicial salaries he said fair compensation for 
those who bear the responsibility for effective functioning of our 
government is critical at this juncture of history 
in advance of the presidents decision which was made public 
late thursday by the white house consumer activist ralph nader 
labeled it the greatest salary grab in government history 
the raise will increase the pay for members of congress and 
federal judges to 135000 a year unless both houses of congress 
reject it by feb 8 
in his letter today the president coupled his support for the 
pay hike with a plea that congress at the same time bar outside 
income such as speaking fees as the commission recommended last 
month 
the current system undermines public faith in the integrity of 
senior federal officials particularly in the legislative branch 
reagan wrote congress should move immediately to enact 
legislation that takes a comprehensive approach to the problems 
posed by honoraria including payments for articles speeches and 
appearances and other forms of financial benefits 
presidentelect bush asked today about the pay raise said he 
supports whatever reagan decides but may take another look at the 
issue when he becomes president 
asked by reporters if the nation could afford the big pay 
increase at a time when it is grappling with huge budget deficits 
bush said well i dont know whether we can afford anything other 
than to get this deficit under control i am vice president and 
i will be supportive of what the president decides ive done that 
for seven and eleventwelfths years and i dont plan to change now 
so lets see what the president says and then when the ball is in my 
court and the buck is stopping on my desk i may have something else 
to say about matters of this nature bush said 
he spoke after the white house released reagans letter 
supporting the pay increase 
rep vic fazio dcalif said im very pleased that the 
president has decided to make this decision this is a pay raise for 
all the toplevel federal officials but of course we 
congress take all the heat 
nader said however mr reagan has put an end to any further 
pretense that he wants his federal deficit reduced he has thumbed 
his nose at the vast majority of the american people republican 
independent and democrat alike who are against the greatest salary 
grab in government history 
reagan could have modified the proposal made last month by the 
commission under the law unless both the house and senate vote to 
head off the pay increases they will automatically take effect 30 
days after the plan is submitted to congress with the proposed 
federal budget on monday 
the commission recommended that members of congress and federal 
district judges who now make 89500 a year be paid 135000 the 
house speakers salary would go from 115000 to 175000 and that 
of majority and minority leaders from 99500 to 155000 
top executivebranch officials such as cabinet members would get 
raises from their current 99500 to 155000 
the commission also recommended that congress raise the 
presidents pay to about 350000 from the current 200000 where 
it has stood since 1969 however such a hike would not take effect 
until 1993 because of a constitutional prohibition on raising a 
presidents pay during his term 
fazio said he believes the senate is likely to reject the raise 
as it has in past years when the house allowed pay hikes to take 
effect the lawmaker said he believed a ban on honoraria would be 
enacted if the raises were accepted he said that would keep the 
overall benefit to lawmakers less than that for judges 
on thursday the nonpartisan national taxpayers union delivered 
petitions to the white house bearing the names of 13000 people who 
oppose the raise 
spokesman david keating said after the white house announcement 
i think reagans action is outrageous adopting fat pay raises for 
top officials will sabotage presidentelect bushs flexible spending 
freeze proposal raising congressional pay by 50 percent is about 
as popular as trading arms with the ayatollah 
a white house statement said that since 1969 salary levels for 
senior federal officials executives legislators and judges have 
declined 35 percent in constant dollars while the compensation of 
workers in the private sector has kept pace with inflation 
federal trial judges are currently earning less than some 
junior lawyers in private practice and are leaving the bench in 
record numbers it said 
in addition deputy white house press secretary leslye arsht said 
the national institutes of health had trouble attracting qualified 
scientists for senior positions in critical areas such as cancer 
research and the average length of service in the executive branch 
had fallen to 18 months 
lloyd cutler chairman of the salary commission said last month 
he expected strong pressure to abolish honoraria and other forms of 
outside pay 
the public interest group common cause has reported that 
lawmakers accepted a record 98 million in speaking fees from 
special interest groups in 1987 
the pay recommendations directly affect about 2500 top federal 
employees and indirectly affect 10000 other highlevel employees 
whose pay is tied to salaries in the top echelon

an official at a leading university 
today said two microscopic tissue samples used for medical education 
may have come from the corpses of nazi victims but he denied the 
practice was widespread 
a report by the television network ard that west german 
universities still use body parts from nazi victims for medical 
instruction has touched off angry reaction from israeli officials 
who called for an official investigation 
but administrators at three west german universities said they 
knew of no tissue samples from nazi victims at their institutions 
and a fourth school tuebingen said it has withdrawn from its 
anatomy collection the two microscopic examples it had had in store 
officials at a fifth west german university could not immediately be 
reached for comment 
tuebingen and heidelberg universities are at the center of the 
furor caused by the ard television report late monday night 
the israeli media also picked up on the ard report saying the two 
universities use body parts from nazi victims including communists 
and the mentally handicapped for medical education 
georg sandberger tuebingen university chancellor today said the 
ard report is incorrect and that there was no widespread use of such 
tissues at his university 
we conducted an inquiry after the allegations we found we had 
only two items of microscopic tissues in our collection of anatomy 
that may have come from the victims of the nazi regime sandberger 
said in a telephone interview from his home in tuebingen 
subsequently i have ordered those withdrawn from the collection 
sandberger said records at the school indicate the two tissue 
samples may have been taken from the corpses of a young polish 
woman and a young german who were decapitated in stuttgart during 
the nazi regime 
he said the tissues may have been left over from the times when 
nazis delivered corpses of their victims to universities for 
anatomical study 
sandberger said in our collection now there are neither body 
parts nor tissues which we can trace to this nazi time 
the ap attempted to reach heidelberg university officials to 
comment on the media allegations but the institute was closed 
because of a local holiday 
the university chancellor siegfried kraft was vacationing in 
the black forest and could not be reached 
sandberger said the media reports were mainly based on wrong 
information which was given by one of our professors he 
apparently was referring to professor ulrich drews 
israel tv quoted drews as saying especially at our university 
these samples taken from corpses of nazi victims are very valuable 
for teaching 
he was further quoted as saying they were prepared in an 
almost artistic manner 
the ap attempted to reach drews four times by telephone at his 
home to ask for comment but there was no answer there was also no 
answer at his office 
sandberger said he was embarrassed about these comments on the 
tissue that they couldnt be removed from the anatomy collection 
because they were wonderfully drafted he added this is not the 
right attitude to have toward this issue 
israel tv reported that more than a thousand bodies were sent to 
german universities for use in medical education during the nazis 
12year rule 
sandberger said tuebingen university had received some corpses 
during that time but that they were all buried in a tuebingen 
cemetery after the war or handed to allied occupation authorities 
a number of west german universities have begun responding to the 
media reports that use of the remains of nazi victims for medical 
education is a widespread occurrence 
since world war ii there have been no samples here from people 
executed or from the bodies of the persecuted said karl zilles 
director of the cologne university anatomy department 
spokesmen at hamburg university and berlin free university also 
said they know of no such samples at their schools and that their 
anatomical collections stem from after the war

rival shiite moslem militias hammered each 
others positions in south lebanon with artillery and grenades 
today and police said at least two people were wounded 
president ali khamenei of iran called on the syrianbacked amal 
and the proiranian hezbollah militias to end the bloodshed saying 
vengeance will not solve anything in lebanon according to the 
islamic republic news agency 
amal and hezbollah fighters battled with mortars guns and 
grenades in jbaa ein bouswar jarjou and louwaizeh which are 
mostly deserted villlages in southern lebanon 
one amal militiaman and a civilian woman were wounded in the 
fighting on the edge of israels selfproclaimed security zone 
north of its border with lebanon police said 
the latest fighting which came after two days of calm brought 
the casualty toll to 29 killed and 78 wounded since clashes between 
the militias began dec 31 according to police 
khamenei accused the americans and the israelis of instigating 
the fighting according to the official iranian agency monitored in 
nicosia 
we believe the confrontation between hezbollah and amal is not 
natural there are hands at work trying to implement the plans of 
global arrogance against the people of lebanon the news agency 
quoted khameini as saying 
global arrogance is the phrase used by iran for the united 
states and its allies 
since dec 31 the two militias have battled in the southern 
slums of beirut and in south lebanon syrian troops stopped the 
violence in beirut 
amal arabic for hope and hezbollah or party of god are 
struggling for dominance of the 1 million shiites lebanons largest 
sect 
syria the main power broker in lebanon maintains an estimated 
40000 troops in the country under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping 
mandate but it has no military presence in south lebanon 
senior officials from both sides have been shuttling between 
damascus and tehran in recent weeks in an apparent effort to dampen

opposition leader kim daejung said 
friday south koreans want stability after years of political turmoil 
and president roh taewoo must keep his promise of full democracy to 
ensure that stability 
people want to see stability stability is the most important 
issue for our people kim said in an interview with the associated 
press 
koreans however are also determined to have democracy after 
years of military rule and there wont be political peace if the 
government fails to meet their expectations he said without 
democracy we cannot have stability he said 
kim leader of the party for peace and democracy also said he 
plans to visit moscow for talks on improving relations he also 
called on the united states to show it fully supports democracy in 
south korea 
roh who completes his first year in office next month has not 
yet proved he intends to meet his promise of bringing in total 
democracy kim said 
kim said he did not see any strong public opinion at this point 
on whether roh should keep a 1987 campaign promise to hold a 
referendum to give voters a chance to evaluate his performance the 
government has indicated a decision on a referendum will be made 
this spring 
asked if he expects roh to complete his fiveyear term kim said 
if he can really be sincere in realizing democracy and realize 
freedom and justice then he can be safe without that his 
government cannot be safe 
the opposition has taken a more moderate approach toward roh in 
recent months apparently sensing a public desire for stability but 
opposition leaders would be quick to seize on any opportunity to 
attack roh if public sentiment turns against the government 
kim and rival opposition leader kim youngsam were defeated by 
roh in december 1987 presidential elections after they split the 
opposition vote roh a former general has implemented broad 
reforms under his promise to introduce full democracy 
a major challenge confronting roh is the governments handling of 
the legacy of his disgraced predecessor chun doohwan and 
uncovering of corruption and human rights abuses under chuns rule 
kim said 
roh a longtime friend of chun opposes opposition demands that 
chun be made to appear before a national assembly investigation into 
misdeeds of the old government chun went into rural exile in 
november after apologizing to the nation 
the government must also complete work on revoking laws and 
restraints imposed by the chun government to support its 
authoritarian rule kim said all restraints on free speech human 
rights and politics must end he said 
the governments investigation into abuses under chun was not 
satisfactory because it centers on individuals rather than 
widespread misdeeds committed by the chun government kim said the 
inquiry must take in the entire chun regime he said 
the opposition leader said he has accepted an invitation to visit 
moscow in 1989 he said he wants to discuss reducing tensions with 
communist north korea 
south korea is making an effort to establish ties with communist 
nations to reduce tensions on the divided korean peninsula and 
promote trade 
good relations with washington and tokyo will remain critical for 
south koreas interests kim said but he expressed hope that 
washington would make it clear that it fully supports democracy in 
south korea to remove suspicion that it has supported authoritarian 
rule in the past he said 
kim expressed concern about growing antiamerican sentiment 
because of a perception that washington helped keep chun in power 
and failed to push for democratic reform 
we are not convinced that america has really changed its korean 
policy to support democracy but i am eager to see such a change so 
that i can persuade our young men and other antiamericans that they 
should not be antiamerican he said

nasa said today the risk of a nuclear accident 
will be only slight when it launches an interplanetary satellite 
containing a plutonium power plant later this year from the space 
shuttle atlantis 
in an environmental impact statement required by law the space 
agency said health and environmental consequences of the most 
probable of accidents a onein10 million chance would be 
small 
the inchthick document was released by the national aeronautics 
and space administration and an abstract was to be published in the 
federal register 
the electric generator holding nearly 50 pounds of plutonium 
oxide will be aboard the galileo spacecraft scheduled for launch 
from the space shuttle in october for a twoyear study of the planet 
jupiter 
according to one estimate if that amount of plutonium were 
released into the atmosphere it would have about 10 times the 
radioactivity of the soviet spy satellite that crashed into canada 
in 1978 plutonium is used in nuclear weapons as well as nuclear 
reactors 
the environmental impact statement calls for public comment over 
the succeeding 45 days before a final statement is issued 
this is part of the approval process the portion of the 
process where the public and interested groups can review our 
thinking and our analysis of the risk and comment said nasa 
spokesman charles redmond this is a nuclear device and through 
this process we hope to get launch approval 
the final approval must come from the president or from the 
office of science and technology policy redmond said 
an intensive analysis of the proposed action indicates that the 
possible health and environmental consequences of launch or mission 
anomalies pose small risks the statement says the accident 
estimated to be the most probable would pose very small health risks 
and very small probability of environmental contamination 
a nuclear generator has not been carried aboard a space shuttle 
before although the devices have been used on space probes and 
manned flights to the moon 
steve aftergood of the center to bridge the gap in los angeles 
said his organization will not oppose use of the generator the 
group has been critical of nuclear power in space 
there is a finite risk he said i believe nasa has done a 
good job of minimizing that risk by design of the system the risk 
is not reduced to zero reasonable people disagree 
the basic question is do the benefits outweigh the risks 
he added my judgment is they do 
on the galileo mission the generator would be used to provide 
electricity to the space probe the satellite does not have solar 
panels because it will travel too distant from the sun to draw 
energy 
it is built to withstand fire and explosions such as the 
accident that destroyed the challenger and killed its crew of seven 
in 1986 
according to the environmental impact statement the most likely 
accident would involve the complicated method used to send the probe 
on its journey that scenario envisions a crash of the satellite 
into earth at high speed 
galileo will be released into earth orbit by the shuttle and 
boosted toward venus by an attached rocket stage flying around 
venus and using a second rocket the probe will gain velocity that 
will speed it back toward earth from earth the satellite will gain 
an additional boost loop out into space and return a second time 
for another push before it finally hurtles toward jupiter the trip 
to jupiter will take six years 
the trajectory is called veega for venusearthearth gravity 
assist 
the maximum credible accident would be an accidental reentry 
into the earth atmosphere during a planned veega flyby the 
statement said it put the chances of that happening as one in 10 
million

a teacher testified today at the murder trial of 
joel steinberg that she once noticed a small bruise on the face of 
lisa steinberg but never saw any signs that the 6yearold was being 
abused 
steinberg is charged with fatally beating the girl whom he 
adopted illegally 
the teacher elizabeth kasowitz said that when she questioned 
lisa about the bruise under her eye the girl told her that her 
little brother had punched her 
did she seem natural asked steinbergs lawyer ira london 
yes she said it with a smile it seemed like a plausible 
explanation 
we always question children when we see visible marks added 
kasowitz a teacher for 16 years 
kasowitz said she and lisa talked about the bruise a few days 
before halloween in 1987 days later lisa was removed unconscious 
from the apartment of steinberg and his lover hedda nussbaum she 
died of brain injuries three days later 
kasowitz said that she had attended faculty conferences and read 
newsletters on how to spot signs that a child is being abused or 
getting improper care 
did you see any of the signs on lisa steinberg when she was 
your student said london 
no said kasowitz 
the teacher said that during the time she knew lisa the child 
seemed happy and displayed no changes in personality or behavior 
she said lisa was late more frequently toward the end of the term 
but that she did not consider the latenesses excessive 
another of steinbergs lawyers adrian diluzio said thursday 
that the defense would call a cabaret singer from dallas who will 
say she saw ms nussbaum abuse lisa 
the firstgraders death in an affluent household led to a 
reexamination of the duty and ability of neighbors teachers and 
social workers to recognize and report evidence of child abuse 
steinberg a disbarred lawyer denies that he hit the child but 
ms nussbaum the prosecutions chief witness said he told her the 
night lisa was fatally injured that he had knocked lisa down and 
she didnt want to get up 
the cabaret singer marilyn walton has said in tv interviews 
that ms nussbaum was jealous of lisa she also has said ms 
nussbaum wanted steinbergs name and money and was upset that she 
didnt get them 
diluzio said ms walton who met the defendant several years ago 
through her attorney will testify that she did observe hedda 
nussbaum mistreat the child on at least one occasion in 1983 or 
1984 
shes going to have some comments as to joels state of mind 
with respect to the child and why joel was always with the child 
because he was afraid to leave the child with hedda diluzio said 
outside court 
on another matter prosecutors said they were considering asking 
judge harold j rothwax to drop the firstdegree manslaughter charge 
against steinberg because their case is based on the theory that he 
fatally beat lisa out of recklessness and depraved indifference not 
because he intended to 
firstdegree manslaughter is charged when a defendant intends to 
cause physical harm to a victim and in doing so ends up killing 
the victim the prosecution said it was considering requesting the 
charge be dropped to avoid confusing the jury 
our theory is that the murder was depraved and not 
intentional said peter casolaro an assistant manhattan district 
attorney 
if they want to do that then i would be inclined to agree to 
it too said diluzio 
rothwax has said he would drop the firstdegree manslaughter 
charge if both sides agreed 
ms nussbaum 46 a former childrens book editor testified for 
seven days as a prosecution witness she had been charged with 
lisas murder along with steinberg but the charges were dropped and 
she became a states witness

arab radicals announced friday the formation of 
a new antiplo alliance in the occupied territories that includes 
moslem fundamentalists and prosyrian extremists opposed to yasser 
arafats recent peace overtures 
palestinians in bethlehem and the surrounding christian villages 
meanwhile observed a general strike to mark the day orthodox 
christians celebrate christmas graffiti painted on buildings called 
for an escalation of the arab uprising 
also friday police said they suspected palestinian nationalists 
were responsible for the killing of an israeli shot to death in the 
occupied west bank the night before 
israeli hikers clashed with arabs as they made their way past the 
occupied west bank village of beit inan on friday israel radio 
said the hikers opened fire at youths who hurled large rocks at 
them but there were no reports of injuries israel radio said 
soldiers evacuated the seven hikers all of whom live on jewish 
west bank settlements near beit inan north of jerusalem police 
detained them briefly for questioning and confiscated their 
firearms the radio said 
in a leaflet issued friday the palestinian radicals accused 
arafat of selling out palestine to imperialism and zionism by 
announcing he recognized israel and renounced terrorism at a news 
conference in geneva last month 
we demand the establishment of a militant leadership to replace 
the diminishing leadership of yasser arafat said the leaflet 
which was signed by the united national front in occupied palestine 
the group is an alliance of islamic extremists and prosyrian 
radicals including members of ahmed jibrils popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command and abu moussas breakaway 
faction of arafats mainstream fatah 
the leaflet said the group rejected all surrenderist 
solutions and advocated liberating the whole of palestine 
through armed struggle 
there can be no reconciliation with the israeli killers and no 
negotiations with zionist criminals the document said we 
oppose any kind of political settlement whatever its source and 
consider negotiation with the enemy to be a grave treason and 
unforgivable crime 
the leaflet also called for the formation of a new palestine 
national council led by palestinian militants who advocate armed 
struggle 
the present council the palestine liberation organizations 
parliament in exile adopted a declaration of independence in 
november that implicitly recognized israel 
prosyrian palestinians said the new alliance was the result of 
increasing cooperation between the two groups in recent months 
the plo has been moving from one mistake to another we totally 
reject the plos political compromises said sufian khatib a 
jerusalem doctor who opposes arafat there is a need to make 
corrections in the plo political line 
also friday merchants closed businesses and all public 
transportation was halted in bethlehem and the nearby christian 
villages of beit jalla and beit sahour in compliance with a general 
strike called by plobacked leaders of the arab uprising 
it was called to coincide with fridays celebration of the 
orthodox christian christmas a procession through bethlehem by the 
greek orthodox patriarch was subdued and traditional christmas 
decorations were absent 
a cluster of about 70 greek orthodox worshipers almost all of 
them palestinians attended christmas mass at the church of the 
nativity built on the site where tradition says jesus was born 
the number of participants was down sharply from the usual 
several hundred worshipers who have filled the church for past 
orthodox christmas celebrations the service was broadcast on 
loudspeakers erected in manger square which was empty except for 
dozens of israeli soldiers on patrol 
a leaflet last month by underground leaders of the uprising 
called for strikes on the western churches christmas eve and jan 6 
to express sympathy for the suffering of palestinians in the revolt 
at least 347 palestinians have died in the nearly 13month 
rebellion fourteen israelis also have died 
in other developments israel radio said security forces suspect 
palestinians kidnapped and murdered shmuel edri 42 a taxi driver 
from the tel aviv suburb of petah tikva 
edris body was found thursday night at a junction near the 
jewish settlement of yakir about 24 miles north of jerusalem a 
police spokesman said he was shot twice in the chest with a 9mm 
pistol 
police confirmed they are considering nationalist motivations but 
said their investigation has reached no definite conclusion 
all directions in the investigation are still open said the 
chief of police in the northern section of the west bank chaim 
malka 
police first noted edris police record as a possible sign the 
murder was criminally motivated but malka later told israel radio 
his criminal record was from the 1970s not the 1980s and his 
crimes were not that great 
a police spokesman said edris taxi was found 1 miles from where 
he was killed

the united states and soviet union are expected 
to sign an agreement sunday on sharing information on drug abuse and 
narcotics trafficking american officials said friday 
secretary of state george p shultz and soviet foreign secretary 
eduard a shevardnadze were to sign the agreement in paris said 
state department spokeswoman catherine shaw 
the agreement is a direct outgrowth of the greater openness in 
the soviet union which after years of denying it had a drug problem 
has been acknowledging greater use of narcotics us officials said 
in the past two years they have reported increased drug use 
particularly in regard to the soldiers coming back from 
afghanistan said shaw the last red army units are due to leave 
afghanistan by feb 15 according to united nationssponsored 
accords signed in geneva last may 
the foundation for the ussoviet narcotics agreement was laid 
last april when the head of the us drug enforcement 
administration john c lawn and the assistant secretary of state 
for international narcotics matters ann wrobleski visited moscow 
to negotiate with their soviet counterparts 
a soviet foreign ministry delegation visited washington in 
november to iron out details of the agreement said shaw 
it is basically an information sharing technical type of 
agreement that hopefully will lead to greater cooperation in 
preventing drug trafficking said shaw 
no agents of the dea will be stationed in the soviet union she 
said but it is envisioned that the dea and the us customs service 
will cooperate with soviet law enforcement authorities she said 
senior dea officials said last summer they expected the agreement 
to be signed by the end of the reagan administration 
the agreement was to cover four main points dea officials said 
exchange of information on drug trafficking and drug routes 
exchange of drug samples analysts can determine the region or 
nation in which a drug originated by detecting a chemical signature 
unique to the substance 
training with soviet officials having expressed interest in 
learning some of the techniques dea agents use 
exchange of data on precursor chemicals such as ether used 
to process cocaine and acetic anhydride used in the manufacture of 
heroin 
in meetings last year the soviets told us officials their main 
drug problems were hashish and opiates apparently smuggled from 
afghanistan along with diverted pharmaceuticals and chemicals made 
in clandestine laboratories said dea operations chief david l 
westrate 
drug dependence in the soviet union has grown at a rate of 50 
percent a year with an estimated 150000 to 200000 heavy users 
soviet officials told lawn and wrobleski during their april meeting 
westrate said in an interview last july 
of those 60 percent were estimated to be under 30 years old 
among those dependent on drugs 45 percent used cannabis mostly 
hashish 35 percent used opiates such as herion and 20 percent used 
pharmaceuticals westrate said the soviets told the american 
delegation 
the soviet drug problem is not rated as serious as that in the 
united states where the dea estimates there are 11 million cocaine 
users and 500000 herion addicts

us ambassador vernon a walters today 
showed the security council large photographs showing what he said 
were missiles under the wings of a libyan jet shot down by us 
forces 
we have photographs that show the planes were armed walters 
said as two pictures about 16by20 inches were passed around 
the missile parts show quite clearly there were two different 
types of missiles on the aircraft wings and hanging from other parts 
of the fuselage he said in an angry tone of voice 
libyan ambassador ali sunni muntasser refused to look at the 
photographs when they were handed to him he brushed them aside and 
told reporters later they are all fakes walters denied it 
walters said the pictures were taken from a videotape shot inside 
one of the two navy f14 jet fighters that shot down two libyan 
mig23s on wednesday over the mediterranean sea 
the us planes were aggressively and hostilely challenged by 
the libyan air force he said the facts and the conversations of 
the us cockpit crews make it all the more clear that they acted 
in selfdefense 
libya maintains its jets were unarmed and did not act in a 
hostile manner 
earlier the soviet ambassador told the council the us action 
was absolutely unfounded and erodes the possibilities of peace 
in the middle east 
nobody attacked the aircraft or ships of the united states 
alexander m belonogov said after the council resumed discussion on 
libyas demand that it condemn the us action a vote on the 
condemnation was not expected before the weekend 
we cannot say the us is entitled to open fire on aircraft of 
another state simply because those aircraft have come close to one 
another in international airspace the soviet representative said 
belonogov who has blamed the incident in part on the us 
military presence in the mediterranean said the soviet union would 
pull its navy from the waterway if the united states did the same 
on thursday the pentagon released the videotape it says was shot 
from inside one of the us jets it shows one libyan plane carrying 
four missiles the videotape showed the us fighters tried 
highspeed maneuvers five times to avoid the mig planes before they 
fired 
outside the council chamber walters rejected suggestions that 
the photographs blowups of the videotape were doctored 
if you want to believe there is nothing here you cant because 
there is something here he said do you think this is a bouquet 
of flowers hanging under the wing he asked reporters 
the us action was deplored by all those who spoke this morning 
including brazil madagascar nepal nicaragua and uganda on 
thursday six speakers representing the arab league burkina faso 
bahrain cuba syria and tunisia condemned the us action 
walters the last on todays list of scheduled speakers said the 
united states resents being taught the norms of international 
behavior by nations governed by various forms of military or 
civilian oneparty dictatorships 
libya wants the 15member security council the most powerful 
un body to formally condemn the us military action not all the 
speakers are from member nations 
a resolution of condemnation was expected to be vetoed by the 
united states and britain two of the five permanent council 
members permanent members who also include the soviet union 
china and france have veto power 
belonogov said the us military action is no way in accord 
with the processes which are now occurring in the international 
arena it also is contradictory to the general tendency to shift the 
middle east process from a deadlock thanks to the beginning of the 
americanpalestinian dialogue 
we cannot agree that the united states should arrogate to 
itself the right to punish or threaten any sovereign state that it 
does not like like libya whatever the pretext the use of force is 
contrary to international law he said 
libya and the united states clashed sharply over the facts of the 
incident when the emergency council session began thursday 
muntasser who sought the urgent meeting called the us action 
a premediated act of aggression and a prelude to largescale 
aggression against economic and military installations 
us representative herberg s okun told the council the us 
jets that shot down the libyans faced imminent threat of being 
shot down by the intercepting libyan aircraft

demanded protection after chinese students at the school distributed 
antiafrican leaflets the chinese claim an african male student 
assaulted a chinese woman student there jan 1 a charge the 
africans deny 
the students also called on beijing to change the chinese name 
for africa which literally means bad continent 
officials at beijing languages institute met representatives of 
boycotting students thursday and friday but reached no agreement 
african diplomats from beijing arrived friday in nanking where a 
dec 24 clash between african and chinese students triggered 
protests and racial unrest in several other cities 
the delegation included congolese ambassador gabriel emouengue 
and kwadwo kwakye acting head of the ghana embassy 
wills tembo of zambia a student at nankings hehai university 
said he and most of the approximately 140 african students in the 
city plan to ask the diplomats to arrange for them to leave china 
we are homebound tembo said in a telephone interview 
also friday hehai university president liang ruiju denied 
african students claims the school now requires them to introduce 
all chinese girlfriends to school officials 
it is nonsense liang said in an interview on state 
television he said the university encouraged friendly exchanges 
between chinese and foreign students but accused the africans of 
breaking rules by bringing girlfriends to their dormitories 
he said chinese students who chanted offensive slogans about 
africans would be criticized and educated it was the first 
criticism by a chinese official of chinese students behavior since 
the unrest began 
liang accused some western media of issuing distorted and 
fictitious reports about the unrest 
the trouble was caused by african students dating of chinese 
women africans at hehai tried to bring several chinese dates to the 
schools christmas eve dance but according to officials refused to 
register their names in keeping with regulations 
a fight broke out in which 11 chinese and two africans were 
injured by official count 
the official xinhua news agency said thursday three african 
students detained by police have admitted they broke the law 
one accused of seriously injuring a hehai employee was under 
arrest and apparently faces trial two others were accused of trying 
to stir up trouble and were given 15 days disciplinary 
detention xinhua said a fourth detained african was released 
apparently without charges 
following the fight thousands of chinese students stoned 
africans dormitories at hehai and other nanking schools thousands 
of young chinese swarmed through city streets shouting slogans such 
as beat the black devils 
by friday all nankings african students had returned to their 
schools following a stay at a suburban guesthouse 
police forced them to go to the guesthouse dec 27 when they 
tried to board a train for beijing on saturday about 400 police 
converged on the guesthouse took four africans into custody and 
forced others to go back to school 
african students and diplomats said the police attacked the group 
at the guesthouse with electric cattle prods and wooden clubs but 
chinese officials deny that 
many african students complain chinese regularly discriminate 
against them 
most of the approximately 1500 african students in china are men 
and social contacts with chinese women frequently cause tension 
they study a wide range of subjects from the chinese language to 
engineering 
chinese also resent that africans many from countries as poor as 
china receive far better food and lodging than chinese students 
chinese officials deny any prejudice and say their longstanding 
policy of giving scholarships to africans shows chinas solidarity 
with the third world

the defense department bowing to opposition in 
eight states and puerto rico has dropped plans to transfer to local 
jurisdiction the last of its onbase schools for children of 
military parents 
the decision leaves intact the responsibility for financing and 
operating 18 schools located inside military bases primarily in the 
south the schools the last of a system that once included about 
100 serve about 36000 children 
the schools are located at bases in alabama georgia kentucky 
louisiana new york north carolina south carolina virginia and 
puerto rico 
congress and the reagan administration have been trying to 
transfer jurisdiction over the schools since 1986 the pentagon 
spends about 138 million a year operating them and administration 
officials wanted to save much of that money by shifting the schools 
from the pentagon 
when jurisdiction is transferred for such schools known as 
section 6 schools after a section of the 1950 law that set them up 
the local district must take over the cost of operating them the 
district does become eligible for small amounts of aid for educating 
the children of servicemen in public schools 
on friday military officials announced they had sent notices to 
congressional leaders dec 30 stating it is not feasible to end 
these arrangements at this time 
discussions have identified broadbased opposition to 
transferring educational responsibility to local school districts 
the pentagon statement continued 
while the specific circumstances for each location vary the 
dod has concluded that the strong opposition of the local 
communities that would have to absorb the section 6 students the 
grave concerns of the military parents that transfers would 
compromise the quality of their childrens education and the 
substantial economic logistical and personnel problems associated 
with transfers prevent the amicable transfer at this time 
the pentagon statement said that savings from the transfer would 
have been at best minimal and that if the government were to 
force local authorities to accept the unwanted transfer of its 
students the militarys harmonious relations with its host 
communities could be endangered 
the schools had their genesis back in the 1800s when schools were 
constructed at frontier forts out west later after world war ii a 
number were established at bases located in rural areas where there 
was no public system to provide an education 
also some of the facilities were built because local districts 
fought the 1954 desegreation of public schools and the defense 
department wanted to maintain racially integrated schools 
in the 1960s the number of section 6 schools dwindled as 
development near bases made it feasible for local school districts 
to operate and as integration took hold in nearby local schools the 
number of onbase schools dropped to 18 in 1973 
the pentagon statement said the department would be willing to 
explore the possibility of future section 6 transfers if a specific 
state is interested 
the 18 remaining schools are located at fort mcclellan fort 
rucker and maxwell air force base in alabama fort benning fort 
stewart and robins air force base in georgia fort campbell and fort 
knox in kentucky england air force base in louisiana the us 
military academy at west point ny fort bragg and camp lejeune in 
north carolina fort jackson laurel bay marine base and myrtle 
beach air force base in south carolina dahlgren naval surface 
weapons center and the quantico marine base in virginia and the 
antilles schools in puerto rico

doctors say they have found a new trail to point 
the way to solving the mystery of sudden infant death syndrome or 
crib death 
in research published in saturdays issue of the british medical 
journal they say they found grossly raised concentrations of 
immunoglobulins or antibodies in the lungs of 16 babies who died 
of crib death and who were compared with a control group of babies 
who died for other reasons 
this suggests that the respiratory tract is the prime target 
organ in the sudden infant death syndrome wrote the research team 
headed by kevin d forsyth of flinders university in australia 
research also showed that many babies had minor breathing 
infections in the week before they died they wrote 
forsyth told reporters i think it is certainly a step forward 
in the research but it is not a step forward in prevention 
it provides a basis for further investigation and it lays a 
trail to point the way we should be looking more carefully 
dr pamela davies who advises the foundation for the study of 
infant deaths said experts had realized for many years that 
respiratory tract infection was likely to be linked to many of the 
deaths she said the foundation would study forsyths findings

a federal appeals court on friday upheld the 
convictions and sentences of four united mine workers members found 
guilty of fatally shooting a nonunion coal truck driver in an 
ambush during a 1985 strike 
the four participated in the slaying of hayes west on may 29 
1985 in pike county ky federal prosecutors said they were 
convicted in us district court of endangering human life by 
disabling a vehicle used in interstate commerce with reckless 
disregard for human life resulting in the death of west and the 
injury of a nonunion driver who was helping deliver coal 
the four also were convicted of carrying a firearm during 
commission of a felony they received prison sentences ranging from 
30 to 45 years 
a threejudge panel of the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
unanimously upheld the december 1987 convictions of james darryl 
smith donnie thornsbury and his cousin david russell thornsbury 
all of canada ky and arnold ray heightland of columbus ohio 
the attorney for the defendants all of whom remain in federal 
custody had sought to have the convictions thrown out edwin j 
walbourn iii disputed the prosecutors definition of interstate 
commerce and said the matter was not within federal jurisdiction 
because wests truck did not and was not scheduled to carry cargo 
across a state line when he was fired upon 
the appeals court upheld the prosecutors interpretation of a 
federal law used to convict the men that held that wests truck was 
part of interstate commerce because it hauled coal destined for 
interstate shipment through west virginia and virgina 
walbourn was in court friday and unavailable for comment on 
whether he would appeal again

the cuban government has agreed to release 44 
political prisoners it previously said would be exempt from a policy 
under which all such detainees would be set free according to 
western diplomats 
the government had said initially the 44 many of whom had 
engaged in armed insurrection against the regime were too dangerous 
to be released 
in april president fidel castro had promised to release all the 
countrys political prisoners estimated by government officials to 
be about 450 
since then about 250 have been released and many have been 
allowed to settle in the united states of the remaining 200 or so 
about 120 have been interviewed by american officials to determine 
whether they wish to emigrate to the united states and their 
eligibility for us residency 
us officials are attempting to arrange interviews with the 
remaining 80 who include the 44 who previously had been exempted 
from the prisoner release policy 
cuban officials have not formally notified the united states 
about the changed status of the 44 but did inform the us catholic 
conference about the new policy in november 
castro announced plans to release all political prisoners last 
april during a visit by new york cardinal john j oconnor 
castro had said the political prisoner release would be carried 
out only if the united states agreed to give them residency papers 
but the western diplomats who insisted on anonymity said a 
number prisoners were released even though they expressed a 
preference for remaining in cuba 
dissident sources rejected the suggestion that cuba will be free 
of political prisoners once all 450 are released 
the sources who asked not to be identified said the government 
routinely trumps up charges against politically unreliable cubans 
and then incarcerates them with common criminals they offered no 
proof that the government engages in such practices 
the western diplomats said they believe there are hundreds of 
cubans who can be described as political prisoners but whom the 
cuban government does not categorize as such 
included are cubans who are serving out jail terms for trying 
illegally to escape the island by boat or other means 
castro has acknowledged that in the early years of the 
revolution there were as many as 15000 political prisoners

deregulation has compromised air traffic safety 
but domestic air travel is still so safe that odds are a person 
could take a flight every day for more than 29000 years before 
being involved in a fatal crash according to a massachusetts 
institute of technology study released friday 
the 197786 figures for domestic nonstop flights with 
established carriers indicate travelers are at 10 times less risk 
today than they were during the 1960s but the skies could be safer 
one can come up with a very long list of things that make one 
nervous about flying but the good news in that very rarely have 
these horrible genies really come out of the bottle said mit 
professor arnold barnett who compiled the fatality statistics with 
pentagon analyst mary k higgins 
but barnett said lax air traffic control substandard 
maintenance undertrained cockpit crews and aging equipment were all 
liabilities associated with airline deregulation 
the death risk per flight in the absence of deregulation would 
have been about 35 percent lower than that actually recorded 
according to the study which appears in management sciences 
january 1989 issue 
barnett also said the record among the approximately 20 carriers 
established after the 1978 airline deregulation act was relatively 
weak 
the new carriers that came about after deregulation as a group 
did not do as well as the more established airlines barnett said 
the new entrants pushed the overall risk level for domestic jet 
flights up by more than 50 percent 
the majority of the upstart airlines which make up 5 percent of 
all domestic flights have never had a passenger fatality but the 
study showed the new carriers death risk per flight between 197986 
was 12 times that of their established counterparts 
the survey which included passenger deaths caused by criminal or 
terrorist acts also found international jet flights have become 
statistically less risky among industrialized nations 
about 700 of 3 billion to 4 billion travelers died in domestic 
air crashes between 197986 barnett said internationally he 
estimated 300 died during the same period in accidents involving 
western carriers while 1000 were killed on airlines from 
lessdeveloped nations 
with international flights there is a pattern in the numbers 
barnett said in a telephone interview from los angeles if you 
talk about westernized regions the international safety records of 
their leading flag carriers have been quite good but when you talk 
about carriers in other parts of the world they have pretty 
consistently been about eight times more risky per flight 
he suggested the prognosis for frequent flyers was good 
people seem more nervous about flying these days and i myself 
have anxieties but it is worth noting that its four or five times 
as safe to fly now as it was a decade ago when no one was worrying 
at all he said

the parents of a cadet killed by a mob 
while on a training cruise on a portuguese island have settled a 
lawsuit for an undisclosed sum attorneys said friday 
leroy and grace blauvelt the parents of maine maritime academy 
cadet paul s blauvelt 19 sued the academy last june for 350000 
charging the academy with allowing their son to suffer great 
physical and mental pain shock and agony 
none of the parties would disclose the amount but steven silin 
an attorney for blauvelts parents said the settlement was fair 
state law limits recovery against state entities such as the 
academy to 300000 and the settlement reached in december was 
far less than that said attorney thomas f monaghan who 
represents the academys insurance companies 
blauvelt was one of 350 cadets on the academys ship state of 
maine when it docked for a spring training cruise in june 1986 on 
madeira about 400 miles off the west african coast in the atlantic

to the dock early in the morning he was met by a pipewielding 
gang pulled from his taxi and beaten 
the academy freshman staggered away from his attackers and fell 
into the harbor and drowned 
two residents of madeira were convicted in absentia in 1987 of 
homicide and three others were found guilty of aiding in the crime 
the blauvelts lawsuit charged that the academy failed to provide 
adequate security and did not establish or enforce guidelines for 
offship activities 
in a statement following the settlement maine maritime academy 
president kenneth curtis said the death of young person is a 
tragedy that can never be forgotten academy officials declined to

sea turtles no longer will be 
raised in captivity for release into the ocean with the suspension 
of an experimental state head start program for reptiles 
no one is sure if we were doing any good said alan huff a 
state department of natural resources biological administrator 
they are not learning the survival skills they should be 
learning 
but others said the suspension of the 25yearold head start 
program in eastern florida may endanger the reptiles just as 
officials are seeing a rapid rise in the number of turtles hatched 
here 
jaynie wright keeper of the house of refuge on hutchinson 
island where the head start program was located said friday that 
83 hatchlings were observed here in 1988 as compared to three 
recently hatched turtles found in 1983 
wright said she believes the turtles that were turned loose when 
the program began in 1964 are returning to the area but since 
officials did not start tagging turtles until 1974 no one is sure 
it takes 17 to 20 years for a turtle to return home to nest she 
said 
huff said the tagged turtles have been found anywhere from new 
york to the azores and argentina 
what we lack is evidence that those animals are reentering the 
reproductive population in florida he said 
there are still hatchling programs in the florida keys india and 
south america huff said 
wright said the reptiles hatched in the wild face dangers ranging 
from red ants to disorienting lights from beach condos 
they go for the sea mainly because the moonlight is hitting the

two hundred works of avantgarde artist kazimir 
malevich long banned because they didnt meet the official idea of 
art were displayed friday in moscows first show in decades devoted 
to the artist 
today is our holiday yuri korolyev director of moscows 
tretyakov gallery told a news conference before the opening the show 
at the museums exhibition hall along the moscow river 
malevichs avantgarde style clashed with the officially approved 
socialist realism which soviet officials counted on to inspire 
people to support their new political and economic system 
museum officials said many of the paintings and graphics never 
had been displayed in the soviet union in recent years several 
paintings have been shown in exhibits of avantgarde art of the 
1920s and 1930s permitted in the freer atmosphere under president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
included in the exhibit put together by several soviet museums 
and the stedelijk museum of amsterdam is malevichs black 
suprematist square his most famous work painted in 191415 which 
is in the tretyakov collection 
the painting of a large black square surrounded by a white border 
showed many cracks and museum officials said it was too delicate to 
be moved from moscow like almost 90 percent of the works it has 
been presevered for decades by soviet curators who could not display 
it 
malevichs theory of suprematism says that a painted shape is not 
devired in any way from the outside world but is its own unique 
creation 
there are a variety of suprematist works of geometric shapes and 
various colors that are placed on the canvas in no clear relation to 
each other no effort is made to give them a threedimensional 
effect 
most of the canvases are white with geometric designs in basic 
shades of black red yellow green or purple the black square is 
considered the ultimate suprematist work because it has absorbed all 
previous painted images 
the tretyakov gallery organized an exhibit of malevichs works in 
1929 but gallery officials said that was the last one devoted to 
malevich until friday 
the exhibit includes works that embrace three decades and a wide 
variety of styles from his early impressionist paintings cubist 
works a series of suprematist paintings following the original 
black square and portraits painted from 1927 until his death in 
1935 
even though the works included in the exhibit are 60 years old or 
older korolyev predicted they would play a big role in the 
continuation of soviet art 
avantgarde artists of the 1920s were part of a great 
experiment and carried with them the great culture of the past 
which contemporary soviet artists will be able to draw upon he 
said 
malevich was born in 1878 in kiev to polish parents wim beeren 
director of the stedelijk museum said he knew two other soviet 
masters of that period vasily kandinsky and marc chagall but did 
not get along with either he taught for two years at an art school 
founded in vitebsk byelorussia founded by chagall but was forced 
to leave because of dislike for his teaching system 
an exhibition of chagalls paintings was held in the soviet union 
in 1987 and several remain on display at the tretyakov gallery 
museum officials said the exhibition of malevichs works will be 
followed by a kandinsky exhibit 
stanislav ivanitsky director of the tretyakovs soviet painting 
department said that while the soviet union retains the majority of 
malevichs work some of the most important paintings are outside 
the country 
faced with indifference to his suprematist works in the soviet 
union he took an exhibit of about 30 paintings to berlin and warsaw 
in 1927 and left them there beeren said seven smaller works 
disappeared during the years of nazi rule but that his museum 
acquired the rest in 1958 it is those paintings his museum 
contributed to the exhibit 
the soviet culture ministry sold two of malevichs suprematist 
works to private collectors in the west in the 1970s ivanitsky said 
museum officials still were upset about the sale 
malevich changed his style after returning from berlin and began 
painting colorful portraits of peasants workers and sportsmen many 
of them without faces he never offered an explanation for changing 
his style and the question still is debated by art experts 
the exhibit was organized by the stedelijk museum and soviet art 
officials beginning in january 1988 and was shown in leningrad 
before moving to moscow

against a former internal revenue service agent and a former 
district attorneys investigator 
i think its a compromise verdict and i think thats unfair 
said mark topel the attorney for dennis diricco an irs agent who 
became a tax lawyer 
its frustrating to go through a long indictment and be 
acquitted on all but the last count said attorney william 
brockett who represented former alameda county district attorneys 
investigator kevin leong 
dericco 40 was convicted thursday of money laundering and 
obstruction of justice but acquitted of seven other charges 
including conspiracy to distribute cocaine 
leong 41 was found guilty of urging a witness to lie to a grand 
jury he was acquitted on five other charges including conspiracy 
the two had been accused by convicted drug smuggler alion 
andersson of participating in a cocaine smuggling ring andersson 
was given a reduced prison term in exchange for testifying against 
diricco and leong 
the defense lawyers complained that the two defendants were 
acquitted of a conspiracy charge that included alleged wrongdoing 
for which they were convicted their motions for a new trial will be 
heard jan 26 
if the convictions stand diricco could receive a maximum 
sentence of 10 years and leong could spend up to five years in 
prison

troops patrolled the capital and three northern states friday after 
militants threatened to avenge two sikhs hanged in connection with 
the 1984 assassination of prime minister indira gandhi 
sikh shopkeepers closed their doors in new delhi bombay and 
across the sikhdominated state of punjab officials said a bus was 
set afire and two bombs were defused friday in punjab but no 
casualties were reported 
mrs gandhi was shot by two sikh bodyguards oct 31 1984 
apparently to revenge an army raid she ordered on the golden temple 
the holiest sikh shrine more than 1200 people died most of them 
sikhs 
satwant singh the lone surviving gunman and kehar singh 
convicted of helping plan the assassination were hanged friday 
morning on the gallows of new delhis maximumsecurity tihar jail 
authorities said 
according to a home ministry official kehar singh proclaimed his 
innocence but appealed to sikhs to refrain from retaliatory attacks 
and satwant singh who never denied shooting mrs gandhi said he 
had no regrets 
as the nooses tightened around their necks the two men shouted 
in their native punjabi an ancient sikh battle cry say the 
faithful god is great 
in amritsar temporal center of the sikh faith residents said 
posters pasted on walls overnight threatened widespread killings of 
hindus if the executions took place the posters in punjabi were 
signed by militant sikhs blamed for 2440 killings in the northern 
state last year 
authorities fearing another communal bloodbath deployed troops in 
new delhi and the three northern states 
at an amritsar prayer service sikh head priest darshan singh 
ragi honored the executed men as martyrs and said they would never 
be forgotten 
they did the right thing in killing mrs gandhi he told a 
gathering of 300 followers 
the executions carried out in a light drizzle inside the 
prisons gray walls ended four years of legal maneuvers 
shortly before 8 am the two men were taken to an open 
courtyard near their cells their hands were tied behind their backs 
and their legs bound in chains 
dressed in white cotton pajamas and wearing yellow kerchiefs over 
their hair they were escorted to the scaffold 
both men were very calm very composed and offered no 
resistance said the home ministry official 
black hoods were pulled over their heads and one inchthick ropes 
placed around their necks then on a final signal from prison 
superintendent jaidev sarangi the two hangmen pulled the bolts that 
released the trap doors beneath them 
relatives of kehar singh 54 waited outside the prison 
including his son rajinder and wife jasbir they broke down at the 
time of the execution other relatives raised clenched fists and 
shouted the same battle cry say the faithful god is great 
police would not permit relatives of satwant singh 30 near the 
heavily barricaded prison 
the two are not related all male sikhs take the name singh 
which means lion 
shortly after the two men were declared dead their bodies were 
cremated within the prison compound according to sikh religious 
rites another home ministry official said 
prison officials said they feared a funeral procession could be 
used to incite violence 
a magistrate and the doctor who pronounced them dead witnessed 
the hangings hours before the executions human rights activists 
and opposition politicians appealed to president ramaswamy 
venkataraman and prime minister rajiv gandhi to spare the lives of 
the condemned men 
the government will rue this day warned opposition leader r 
hegve 
mrs gandhi was gunned down in the garden of her official 
residence by two of her sikh bodyguards on oct 31 1984 one of the 
assassins beant singh was gunned down by other security guards 
minutes after mrs gandhi fell satwant singh was arrested after he 
recovered from bullet wounds 
kehar singh beants uncle was arrested and charged with 
conspiracy a month later 
after an eightmonth trial in a makeshift courtroom at tihar 
jail both were convicted and sentenced to death jan 22 1986 the 
convictions and sentences were upheld by the high court and supreme 
court 
in london several dozen sikh protesters demonstrated outside the 
indian high commission and 23 were arrested for obstruction they 
later were cautioned and released scotland yard said 
sikh leaders in britain accused the indian government of doing 
nothing to bring to justice people involved in antisikh riots 
following mrs gandhis death they claim the riots resulted in 
killings of 10000 sikhs 
sikhs comprise only 2 percent of indias 880 million people but 
they are in a majority in northern punjab state sikh militants 
began fighting for an independent homeland in 1982 and the movement

robert a farmer who set a democratic party 
fundraising record in 1988 announced friday his candidacy for 
treasurer of the democratic national committee 
farmer who was credited with raising nearly 70 million for the 
1988 campaign said he would set a goal of raising at least 100 
million for the party over the next four years 
when asked for his view of socalled soft money political 
contributions outside the limits covering most donations to 
candidates and parties farmer said the rules are the rules and i 
refuse to apologize for raising money at the level of the 
republicans 
would he continue seeking soft money 
absolutely said farmer 
both parties raised millions of dollars last year from 
individuals who gave up to 100000 each that money was used for 
voter registration drives and other activities defined as 
strengthening local parties rather than directly advocating the 
election of candidates for president or congress 
individuals are limited to contributions of 1000 to candidates 
for federal office and 5000 to political action committees there 
is a 20000 limit on individual contributions to national party 
committees 
farmer who headed the fundraising operation for michael 
dukakis said he didnt know if the massachusetts governor would 
seek the presidency again in 1992 but added i dont think hes 
going to be a candidate 
sharon pratt dixon the current party treasurer is not seeking 
another term and farmer is not expected to have serious opposition 
for the post when it is filled when the dnc meets next month

a condominium board has postponed a decision 
on whether to evict 9yearold jamie swartz who moved into her 
fathers apartment in an adultsonly complex while her mother was 
dying of cancer 
board members decided thursday night to wait a couple of months 
while they consider the implications of a fair housing law that 
takes effect in march 
it must be similar to what someone on death row must feel 
said jill swartz jamies stepmother its not over yet its just 
a reprieve until they find something else to throw at us 
jamie moved into the complex last april to live with her father 
lynn and his new wife while the girls 42yearold mother maye 
swartz was treated for cancer 
the condo board voted in july to allow jamie to stay until her 
mother finished chemotherapy she died in september 
the board threatened to seek eviction in november but then 
allowed the girl to remain through the holidays provided the 
twobedroom condo was placed on the market 
the swartzes said there have been few buyers interested in the 
condo purchased three years ago for about 50000 
meanwhile questions have been raised about the states fair 
housing amendment act which takes effect march 12 the law bans age 
discrimination in housing with a few exemptions among them are 
apartment complexes in which 80 percent of the units have a resident 
who is at least 55 years old 
the viewpointe condo board is not clear if it meets the age 
exemption according to its attorney douglas neway the board has 
scheduled a meeting for jan 10 to vote on a proposal to require at 
least one resident at least 55 years old in each unit 
some condo residents are unhappy with the boards leadership 
i think if they get the 55 or older thing through theyll be 
right back on jamies case again said marcy esposito who is 
trying to get on the board 
esposito and other residents are trying to replace the board at 
the condo elections later this month

the environmental protection agency said friday 
it plans to make permanent the temporary limit on residues of 
sulfite pesticides on grapes 
grape shippers and importers have been permitted to sell grapes 
containing sulfite residues up to 10 parts per million for the past 
two years while epa investigated what the permanent limit should be 
the agency said it would receive public comments for the next 30 
days on making 10 ppm the permanent limit 
sulfur compounds have been used on grapes for more than 60 years 
to prevent rotting during shipment until 1986 no legal residue 
limit was in effect because the compounds were listed by the food 
and drug administration as generally recognized as safe a 
status the fda revoked that year 
sulfites can trigger adverse reactions in a small number of 
sensitive people mostly asthmatics

the camera system that produced photos of this 
weeks dogfight between us and libyan fighters is a relatively new 
one whose principal purpose has nothing to do with recording images 
of aerial action 
the system operates with videotape and was installed in the 
navys f14 tomcat fighters starting in the early 1980s 
but according to lt cmdr craig quigley a navy spokesman the 
systems principal purpose is to magnify vision to a range of 
20to30 miles 
the system is designed to increase the visual identification 
range of the pilot quigley added the pilot can use the camera 
system to pick up targets far beyond normal sight 
obviously its second purpose is to serve as a gun camera and 
record any action 
the spokesman said the installation of target or gun cameras in 
navy aircraft is nothing new dating back to the days of world war 
ii the only serious change in the procedure over the past decade 
has been the switch from 16mm camera film to the magnetic videotape 
now used 
cameras also are installed on the navys attack aircraft like 
the a6 intruder the pentagon previously released videotape shot by 
a6s and air force f111 bombers after the us raid on libya in 
1986

an amtrak train derailment in pennsylvania was 
likely caused by a tower operator who tested for positive for drugs 
and by problems with amtraks system of keeping trains off 
outofservice tracks federal officials said friday 
the national transportation safety board divided blame for the 
january 1988 accident which injured 25 people between control 
tower operator thomas connor and the passenger line 
the ntsb report said amtrak should develop a procedure to 
prevent locomotives or trains from entering outofservice track 
sections unless permission has been received from the person in 
charge of the outofservice track 
connor who resigned after the accident was on duty when the 
train struck a work vehicle in chester pa near philadelphia jan 
29 officials said he let the train to travel on a section of track 
undergoing maintenance 
connor fled his post and did not submit to required drug tests 
until more than 72 hours after the accident marijuana and small 
traces of cocaine and methamphetamine were detected in his system 
the ntsb said connor because of impairment by drugs or 
distraction or both did not hit a switch to let the train cross 
to the proper track 
but the agency also said amtrak failed to adequately monitor 
the activities and job performance of the tower operator the ntsb 
recommended the line establish standards for the selection training 
and responsibilities of tower operators 
amtrak spokesman john jacobsen said he hadnt yet seen the ntsb 
report 
but after being read its conclusions jacobsen said he did not 
know if the ntsb was aware amtrak is been phasing out tower 
operators 
theyre clearly dealing with what was not what is its being 
shifted to remote control by computer he said 
but jacobsen said the old system was safe too 
while the system were moving to has more safeguards the old 
system was a safe system all one had to do was follow it 
connor jacobsen said had standing orders that the track had 
been taken out of service by the dispatcher were just lucky in 
this situation that no one was killed 
an assistant conductor on the train also tested positive for 
marijuana but he was not believed to have played a role in the 
accident according to the federal railroad administration 
the fra announced the drug test results last february but it was 
left to the ntsb to determine the accidents likely cause

he was not in a critical state 
his overall condition appears to be weakening imperial 
household agency spokesman kenji maeda said at a regular press 
briefing his kidney and other organ functions may have been 
affected slightly 
he added that hirohito had been clearly conscious and was not 
yet in critical condition 
according to maeda hirohitos blood pressure stood at 68 over 30 
for the secondconsecutive day friday the reading has been well 
below 90 since thursday morning despite efforts to push it up with 
emergency blood transfusions 
an average systolic or upper blood pressure reading is about 
120 and a sustained level below 100 can lead to irreversible damage 
to the brain and other internal organs due to insufficient oxygen 
flow doctors say 
it is unlikely that his blood pressure will recover 
significantly considering his failing health a palace official 
said speaking on condition of anonymity doctors dont seem to be 
concerned about the low blood pressure so much as long as it stays 
above 70 
hirohitos respiration rate which jumped to 32 breaths per 
minute earlier eased back to 26 by friday night maeda said adding 
that when physicians applied an oxygen mask to the frail emperor 
hirohito tried to brush it away 
the japanese monarch has been ill since last september with 
internal hemorrhaging he has continued to bleed intermittently 
since then and maeda said physicians again friday inserted a tube 
through the emperors nose to extract blood accumulated in his 
stomach 
hirohito is believed to be bleeding in the upper intestinal area 
where he underwent a bypass operation in september 1987 news 
reports have speculated he has pancreatic cancer but the imperial 
household agency which manages palace affairs has refused to 
confirm or deny the reports 
the monarch has been bedridden at the moatsurrounded fukiage 
palace since sept 19 and is being fed intravenously he has 
consumed only a few spoonfuls of porridge and some fragments of ice 
since the onset of the crisis and his weight has reportedly dropped 
below 60 pounds well below the 110 pounds he weighed before falling 
ill 
doctors have relied on transfusions to treat the emperor and make 
up for his blood loss as well as declining physical strength as of 
thursday evening hirohito had received nearly 68 pints of blood 
more than eight times the normal amount circulating in his body 
crown prince akihito hirohitos son has taken over the 
emperors largely ceremonial duties under the constitution the 
emperor has no real political power and his duties consist mainly of 
meeting visiting dignitaries and fixing his seal on laws passed by 
japans cabinet

a federal judge indicated friday he might delay 
the jan 31 start of the irancontra trial of oliver l north 
because prosecutors have sought dismissal of conspiracy and theft 
counts against the fired national security council aide 
all dates now scheduled will be reviewed at a hearing monday 
in light of the dismissal motion by independent counsel lawrence 
walsh us district judge gerhard gesell said in a onesentence 
order 
gesell will consider walshs dismissal motion at the hearing 
dropping the two main counts is expected to require significant 
adjustments in the documents both sides plan to present in the case 
attorney general dick thornburgh meanwhile defended the reagan 
administrations position to limit disclosure of classified 
information in the case 
the administrations position contributed to walshs decision to 
abandon the charges that accuse north of illegally diverting more 
than 14 million in usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan 
rebels three others are also charged with the same counts but 
their trials have been severed 
an interagency intelligence group in the administration refused 
to permit the release of additional classified material which gesell 
said must be disclosed in order for north to get a fair trial 
dropping the conspiracy and theft counts is hardly going to 
provide a precedent in every case thornburgh said 
in every case there is going to have to be the type of 
balancing walsh carried out here he said 
one the one hand is it more important to go ahead with a 
particular criminal prosecution that involves a particular defendant 
and a particular offense as against what harm might come to the 
countrys longterm interests from exposing of sensitive 
information 
walsh made the decision here to protect this information rather 
than go forward with these counts in the indictment that was 
returned thornburgh added 
walsh said he also based his decision on norths insistence on 
introducing classified information in his defense and on gesells 
refusal tuesday to reconsider his order of last month on what 
classified information must be disclosed the judge said the 
administration had deleted too much information from the secret 
government documents walsh wants to use as evidence 
meanwhile in a motion filed in federal court walshs office 
said norths lawyers are impermissibly trying to increase the number 
of classified documents they will be allowed to use at trial to at 
least 550 
walshs office plans to use 300 classified government documents 
to prosecute north and gesell has limited the defense to the same 
number 
the prosecution asked gesell for an order reducing the number of 
documents north plans to use 
if the conspiracy and theft counts against north are dismissed 
12 charges would remain carrying maximum total penalties of 60 years 
in prison and 3 million in fines 
nine of the 12 counts that would remain focus on north allegedly 
concealing from congress and former attorney general edwin meese iii 
his efforts on behalf of the contras four of the nine deal with 
alleged concealment of the diversion of money to the contras from 
the administrations secret arms sales to iran 
north also is accused of illegally accepting a 13800 security 
system at his home from codefendant secord converting to his own 
use at least 4300 in travelers checks from contra leader adolfo 
calero and conspiring to defraud the treasury of tax revenue in 
connection with charitable contributions supporting the contras

afghan rebel leaders ended talks with 
a soviet diplomat on friday without reaching agreement on whether 
the sovietbacked communist party would play a role in a new afghan 
government 
guerrilla leaders after meeting with soviet deputy foreign 
minister yuli vorontsov said they believed soviet troops will stick 
to their deadline and pull out of afghanistan by feb 15 
they confirmed this said sibghatullah mojaddidi a guerrilla 
leader 
but guerrilla leaders said the sides still could not agree on the 
government that would be left behind once the red army ends its 
decadelong occupation 
mojaddidi chairman of a loose alliance of seven pakistanbased 
guerrilla groups said the only agreement that came out of fridays 
talks was that we will continue the negotiations after a few 
days 
moscow sent more than 100000 soldiers into afghanistan in 1979 
to replace the faltering communist government with a new one troops 
remained to quell the anticommunist insurgency 
under a unbrokered accord reached in april moscow agreed to 
end its occupation by midfebruary it said half of its troops had 
left by august 
vorontsov told reporters when he arrived in islamabad on 
wednesday that the withdrawal deadline could be delayed if moslem 
insurgents continued fighting 
they asked for a ceasefire several times but we said a 
ceasefire is not possible said mojaddidi but we said we can 
stop attacking your military forces when they are leaving 
afghanistan 
he said the sides also reached an impasse on the role of kabuls 
marxist peoples democratic party of afghansitan 
despite rebel demands that moscow stop insisting that the ruling 
communists play a role in a postwar government vorontsov continued 
to press for party representation mojaddidi said 
they want the present regime to participate in the future 
government said mojaddidi but we cant 
guerrilla factions based in pakistan and iran agreed before 
fridays talks that afghanistans president najib and his marxist 
party were a stumbling block to peace in afghanistan 
vorontsov refused comment on the talks he has scheduled a press 
conference for saturday the final day of his fourday trip he is 
to meet prime minister benazir bhutto of pakistan on saturday 
the soviet envoy also is to meet with pakistan foreign minister 
sahabzada yaqub khan friday night at a sovietsponsored dinner the 
soviet union has said that pakistans ardent support for the 
guerrillas has worsened the prospects for peace in afghanistan 
a pakistan foreign ministry spokesman speaking on condition he 
not be identified said pakistan wants to make clear to the soviets 
that there will be a transfer of power in afghanistan following the 
final troop withdrawal regardless of political agreements 
whether it is peaceful depends on whether the soviet union is 
prepared to accept the demise of the afghan communist party he said 
the first round of direct talks between afghan guerrilla fighters 
and the soviet union was held dec 35 in the saudi arabian resort 
city of taif 
the kremlin has stepped up its political maneuvering for a 
peaceful settlement to the afghan war shuttling vorontsov between 
pakistan and iran where more than 5 million war refugees live and 
rome where the former afghan king zahir shah lives 
about 17 percent of afghanistans 15 million people belong to the 
shiite sect of islam which is practiced by most iranians as well 
the majority of afghans are sunni moslems like the pakistanbased 
guerrillas 
the guerrillas announced tuesday that a council will be 
established within weeks to select a transitional government each 
of the seven parties is to nominate 60 members to this council 
the iranianbased afghan fighters also were asked to name 60 
members a spokesman for the shiite fighters timurpur said the 
guerrillas in iran have not decided to participate in this council 
mojaddidi said vorontsov accepted the council but the council 
for them is another thing they think the regime will 
participate but we said only moslem elements could participate not 
nonmoslems

an archbishop of the armenian church searched for 
hope as he observed a somber christmas liturgy friday with 
sorrowful eyes following the tragedy in his homeland that 
claimed 25000 lives 
the pain is deep i saw it with my own eyes archbishop 
torkom manoogian of the diocese of the armenian church of america 
said during a divine liturgy at st vartan cathedral in manhattan 
the church observes christmas on jan 6 
even though we are mourning we can still say merry 
christmas he said in armenian we ask god for the grace to be 
able to celebrate christmas through these hard times 
the pain of the earthquake that devastated soviet armenia on dec 
7 was felt by those who had gathered hundreds of thousands were 
left homeless and 25000 people were killed 
relief poured in from around the world including 3 million a 
diocesan spokeswoman said was collected locally a hangar at kennedy 
international airport was donated for collecting and transporting 
relief supplies she said 
the archbishop designated a 40day period of mourning that ends 
jan 15 the money for christmas gifts went to relief efforts 
festivities including new years celebrations were put off 
the churchs usual childrens christmas party on saturday will be 
replaced by a requiem for the children who died followed by a 
madagh or memorial meal 
we cant believe the earthquake happened we may ask where is 
god because such a tragedy happened manogian continued in 
armenian as translated by the church spokeswoman aileen krikoryan

compassion and steadfast faith 
among the 100 people or so scattered about the cavernous 
cathedral were those who had lost relatives but armenians quickly 
tell visitors that all armenians are related 
im not particularly religious but i feel compelled to come in 
light of the tragedy the armenian church helps us grieve 
together said mendor ozcelik a 21yearold new york resident who 
attends the university of connecticut at storrs 
the church is more than religion to armenians its unifying 
us in a nationalistic way he said adding that he attended 
services on the first sunday after the earthquake for the first time 
in years

thieves who stole four trailers loaded with 
alcoholic beverages stereo components and clothing got more than 
they bargained for authorities say the cargo is contaminated with 
dangerous pesticides 
anybody just handling the cartons could be poisoned if they put 
their hands in their mouth or eye the poison may not show up for 
weeks said laverne guillen spokeswoman for the metrodade fire 
department 
three of the trailers which were stolen over new years weekend 
have been recovered she said friday but the first two were

cognac she said two other trailers also contained alcohol and 
authorities warned the public not to buy alcoholic beverages 
anywhere except in licensed liquor stores 
the cartons became contaminated during a september fire at a dade 
county warehouse containing hazardous materials ms guillen said 
authorities are uncertain whether the poisonous chemicals seeped 
through the corks of the stolen imported champagne or into the 
bottles of rum brandy and cognac in the cartons according to capt 
tom wheeler of the state alcoholic beverages and tobacco division 
ms guillen said the cartons were loaded onto the trailers for 
shipment to alabama for disposal florida does not allow hazardous

the nations military services met or exceeded 
their recruiting goals for the ninth consecutive year in fiscal 
1988 but concern is growing about the future the pentagon said 
friday 
even though the defense department does not need to recruit as 
many men and women this year as it did last delayed entry program 
participation has declined to the lowest level in five years the 
pentagon said in a new report 
moreover the reduction in recruiting goals should make it easier 
to improve the current recordhigh number of high school graduates 
among the volunteers but that is not happening the pentagon added 
the delayed entry program lets individuals sign up for military 
service but delay the start of basic training until a later date or 
when specific job openings occur that pool of individuals is a key 
tool for recruiters who need to spread the flow of new enlistments 
throughout the year 
with a strong economy and the shrinking pool of youth available 
for military service the services are facing significantly more 
competitive market conditions said grant s green jr the 
assistant defense secretary for personnel 
the services ability to obtain highquality volunteers and 
retain the best and brightest of them will depend upon support 
of the congress and the american people for adequate military 
compensation qualityoflife initiatives and recruiting resources 
and incentives 
the new recruiting and reenlistment results released friday 
cover fiscal 1988 the 12 months ending last sept 30 during that 
period the pentagon significantly cut its recruiting goals because 
of a decision by the administration to reduce the size of the army 
navy air force and marine corps to accommodate congressional budget 
cuts 
the new report shows 93 percent of the recruits who joined the 
military in fiscal 1988 had a high school diploma exactly matching 
the figure reported in fiscal 1987 
those results are significantly above the high school graduation 
rates for the american youth population as a whole roughly 75 
percent 
reenlistment results meantime were satisfactory despite slow 
starts in some areas the pentagon continued 
the percentages of men and women reenlisting in the air force 
and marine corps dipped slightly on a percentage basis of those 
eligible but the declines caused no problem because the services 
also had reduced their goals in that area 
all told the four services recruited 286700 men and women 
between oct 1 1987 and sept 30 1988 slightly exceeding the 
combined objective of 286400 of that total 272600 were men and 
women who had not previously served in the military while the 
remaining 14100 were individuals returning to the services after 
breaks in their military careers 
of the 272600 firsttime recruits 254000 or 932 percent had 
graduated from high school 
moreover the recruits who entered the service during the past 
year scored unusually well on the armed forces qualification test a 
special standardized skill exam given all new enlistees ninetyfive 
percent of the recruits scored average or above on the test this 
past year just one percentage point below the alltime record of 96 
percent set in fiscal 1986 
the united states switched to an allvolunteer military in 1973 
after years of trying to establish the system and attract 
highquality recruits the defense department finally met its annual 
recruiting objective in fiscal 1980 and has managed to meet or 
exceed the annual goals ever since 
according to the latest report the army signed up 115300 men 
and women during fiscal 1988 slightly exceeding its goal of 
115000 the navy recruited 94000 individuals precisely matching 
its goal while the marine corps recruiting 35900 men and women 
matching its goal the air force recruited 41500 individuals also 
matching its goal 
overall 67 percent of the men and women who were eligible to 
reenlist in their respective services did so in fiscal 1988 or 
251300 of the 374600 eligible that slightly exceeds the previous 
years tally of 65 percent 
of the firsttime recruits who joined the military in fiscal 
1988 34400 were women or 126 percent and 238200 were men 
that overall percentage for women exceeds the fiscal 1987 rate of 
122 percent 
of the four services the air force continued to attract by far 
the most women 8100 out of 41200 total or 197 percent 
the report shows blacks comprised 56500 of the firsttime 
recruits who joined in fiscal 1988 or 207 percent up one 
percentage point compared to fiscal 1987 
the pentagon said there were 110500 individuals in the delayed 
entry program as of sept 30 down sharply from the 123700 reported 
a year earlier

ingram also a customer he wouldnt listen 
police and witnesses said the gunman walked into the market

british investigators believe the 
bomb that exploded aboard pan am flight 103 last month was attached 
to the outside of the airliner at londons heathrow airport a west 
german newspaper reported friday 
a spokesman for the government press office in bonn said he could 
not confirm or deny the report 
the munich abendzeitung newspaper said british flight 
officials have informed the bonn interior ministry that 
investigators now feel that the bomb that caused the pan am 
explosion shortly before christmas was affixed to the outside of the 
plane at londons heathrow airport 
the brief report made available to other news media also said 
british officials believe that at least 100 people had access to 
the boeing 747 in london before it departed and crashed over 
lockerbie scotland on dec 21 killing all 259 people on board and 
11 on the ground 
the newspaper cited west german security sources for its 
information 
government press spokesman ulrich strempel said by telephone i 
cannot confirm or deny such a report 
we dont like to comment on reports that simply cite security 
sources strempel said 
interior ministry spokesman michaelandreas butz also said he 
could not comment on the report 
i find that all this sort of speculation should stop butz 
said i cannot confirm or deny the report 
since the bombing of pan am flight 103 speculation on how the 
bomb was placed on the airliner has been widespread flight 103 
began in frankfurt with a boeing 727 but in london switched to the 
boeing 747 that crashed over lockerbie scotland as it headed to 
new york 
west german investigators repeatedly have said they have found no 
evidence that the bomb may have slipped through security checks in 
luggage placed aboard the flight in frankfurt and later transferred 
to the boeing 747

a federal appeals court in a ruling cited by 
the banking industry as precedentsetting said friday that 
citibank the largest bank in the nation can operate a subsidiary 
to insure municipal bonds 
the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
said the office of the comptroller of the currency the chief 
regulator of nationally chartered banks properly permitted citibank 
to purchase the american municipal bond assurance corp known as 
ambac 
the decision by comptroller robert l clarke had been challenged 
by the american insurance association as a violation of the bank 
holding company act citibank is owned by citicorp a bank holding 
company regulated by the federal reserve board 
the insurance association after losing in us district court 
won an appeal in august the appeals panel said the bank holding 
company act and thus federal reserve jurisdiction applied fridays 
ruling however reverses that part of the august decision 
even though citibank is a nationally chartered bank stephen 
verdier an attorney with the independent bankers association of 
america said the latest court ruling represents a blow to a 
proposal by the federal reserve to extend its jurisdiction over the 
activities of subsidiaries of state banks owned by holding companies 
the fed in november proposed a regulation requiring state banks 
owned by holding companies to get its permission before establishing 
real estate insurance and other nonbanking operations even when 
state law permits the operations banks have opposed the fed 
proposal as a power grab 
the significance obviously goes well beyond whether citibank 
can own an insurance subsidiary it really pulls the rug out 
from under the federal reserve verdier said 
stephen katsanos a spokesman for the federal deposit insurance 
corp which insures bank deposits and is the primary regulator of 
statechartered banks that are not members of the federal reserve 
said fdic chairman l william seidman was quite pleased with the 
decision 
it tracks very well with his philosophy that banks should be 
allowed to expand their activities through bank affiliates or 
subsidiaries provided adequate safeguards are set up he said

william benson returned home from his 50th birthday party he found 
50 pink plastic flamingos planted in his front lawn 
the gaudy pink birds were a gift from bensons brother robert 
of west palm beach fla 
benson said his brother shipped the plastic birds to an uncle and 
cousin who live in nearby bristol wis 
the two men apparently arrived at bensons home on the night of 
dec 16 to drill 100 holes in the frozen ground and stand the 
florida flamingos on their wire legs while benson was gone 
benson said he decided to leave the birds in the ground until his 
brother arrived for a visit over the holidays 
i wanted him to see what he had done said benson who owns 
an oil company 
but a deep freeze that followed after christmas left the ground 
so hard that the plastic birds will have to wait for the spring thaw 
to be removed benson said

us beef and veal treated with hormones will 
be accepted in the 12 countries of the european economic community 
until jan 31 if it was shipped before the end of 1988 a spokesman 
for us trade representative clayton yeutter said friday 
cary c walker reported the truce in the socalled hormone 
war was approved thursday essentially for goods in transit 
a european ban on imports of such meat went into effect jan 1 
affecting us sales worth about 100 million a year there was an 
immediate us reprisal in the form of an additional 100 percent 
import duty on a group of food imports including danish hams and 
sundried tomatoes from italy worth about the same amount 
under the agreement the united states is also suspending the new 
duties on goods if they were shipped before jan 1 and arrive in 
this country by jan 31 walker said unidentified governments in the 
community suggested the truce and the us administration accepted 
on condition it apply throughout the 12 countries 
hormones are implanted in cows and calves to make them grow 
faster their use is forbidden in the ecc countries but there have 
been reports of widespread violations 
the 12 governments maintain that because of the ban they have 
the right under international agreements to also ban imports other 
exporters of beef to erope including canada and australia have 
agreed to ship only meat from animals not implanted 
alan holmer yeutters deputy said thursday the import ban is a

rock hudsons young homosexual lover never 
learned that the movie star had aids until hudson collapsed in paris 
and told his secretary take care of the kid i may have killed 
him a lawyer told jurors friday 
in his opening statement in an 11 million lawsuit against 
hudsons estate attorney harold rhoden said that secretary mark 
miller hid hudsons disease from marc christian until the whole 
world heard about it 
marc christian got a call from mark miller in france said 
rhoden he said im sorry the movie star told me not to tell 
you i know its not fair but i was only following orders 
then rhoden added miller said hudson wanted christian to fly to 
paris and see a doctor he quoted miller as saying rock told me 
take care of the kid i may have killed him 
rhodens version is disputed by attorneys for miller and the 
hudson estate 
they contend that the love affair between hudson and christian 
soured in early 1984 because christian told hudson he had sold sex 
for money they allege that hudson stopped having sex with christian 
and allowed him to stay in his home for the next year and a half 
only because christian threatened to expose the stars homosexuality 
rhoden said hudson hid his disease from his lover and was abetted 
in his lies by miller who told christian that the actor had 
anorexia not aids 
rock hudson who was 58 at the time he was dying wanted to 
continue enjoying sex with then 29yearold marc christian rhoden 
said 
mark miller to please his boss conspired to put this young 
mans life at risk 
rhoden said the trials key issue would be whether hudson had a 
duty to warn his sexual partner that he had aids and whether 
christian should be compensated for emotional distress and 
enhanced fear that he had been infected 
attorneys for the estate argue that christians fear is 
unwarranted because he has tested negative for the aids virus and 
has no symptoms of the disease 
rhoden described for jurors a tender 2year love affair which 
began when the actor and christian met at a political fundraiser in 
october 1982 christian was 28 and hudson was 56 he said the actor 
called christian and soon they were meeting regularly for lunch 
in early 1983 he said hudson said he was falling in love with 
christian and that he hadnt felt this way since he was in high 
school in april he said the two men went away together for a 
weekend and the sexual affair began and by november christian had 
moved into hudsons home above beverly hills 
rhoden said the two men engaged in sex three to five times a week 
with neither using a condom in 1984 he said hudson developed 
symptoms of aids rashes and sores on his body profuse sweating at 
night and rapid weight loss 
in june 1984 hudson was diagnosed as having aids rhoden said 
but decided not to tell christian 
miller said to him are you going to tell the kid rhoden 
said and hudson said no and under no circumstances are you to 
tell christian it is my disease and ill handle it my way 
shortly before his death on october 5 1985 rhoden said 
christian confronted the actor at ucla medical center 
in the hospital marc said to hudson i had a right to know 
hudsons only response was yeah you did 
if marc chrstian had been told he would not have left rock 
hudson because he loved him rhoden concluded but he would not 
have committed suicide he would not have engaged in any further 
intercourse with hudson

us ambassador vernon a walters exhibited 
blurred photographs to the security council on friday showing what 
he called a heavily armed libyan mig23 and said us jets shot down 
that plane and a companion mig23 in selfdefense 
libyan ambassador ali sunni muntasser called the photographs 
doctored and said it is completely fake it is untrue 
walters later asked reporters do you think this is a bouquet 
of roses hanging under the wing 
we have photographs which prove that the planes were armed 
he said 
walters passed two photographs around the council chamber where 
libya has sought an emergency session to condemn the us downing of 
its two aircraft on wednesday libya says they were unarmed planes 
on a reconnaissance mission over international waters of the 
mediterranean sea 
the two enlarged photographs show two views of one of the two 
migs the us mission said they are labeled libyan mig23 
flogger one shows a full view of an aircraft with what the united 
states said are two apex and two aphid missiles the other shows a 
portion of an aircraft in the lower right corner 
the missile parts show quite clearly walters said of the 
photos taken from a videotape there were two different types of 
missiles on the aircraft wings and hanging from other parts ofthe 
fuselage 
we have photographs that show the planes were armed walters 
said you can see for yourself whether there were or were not 
missiles 
he said the photos were taken by one of the us f14 tomcats 
that shot down the libyan aircraft the blackandwhite photographs 
were enlarged to about 16 inches by 20 inches and showed blurred 
objects under the wing 
routine operations over international waters were 
aggressively and hostilely challenged by the libyan air force 
walters said 
the session which began thursday was expected to discuss a 
resolution condemning the us action delegates adjourned friday 
evening until 1030 am monday the united states and britain were 
expected to veto any such resolution in any event 
the recordings of the pilots conversations and the photographs 
make it all he more clear that the united states acted in 
selfdefense walters said 
muntasser at first shunned the photographs and brushed them aside 
as they were passed around the council for examination but he later 
said he had examined them and rejected them 
we are in the country of hollywood he told reporters it 
is very welledited very well done and it is not true he quoted 
the new york times which described the videotape as blurred and 
indistinct 
he said the united states could have photographed migs in vietnam 
and used other film 
muntasser said the libyan aircraft were not challenging and 
threatening the us jets the americans are provoking us they 
want us to retaliate and then they will attack libya that is the 
whole reason he said 
walters likened the evasive actions of the us pilots to that of 
a citizen trying to avoid a mugger if you are walking down a dark 
alley and see a man with a pistol walking behind you you cross the 
street and he crosses the street you recross and he recrosses you 
do it five times and he follows you you have to wonder if hes 
going to hand you a bouquet of flowers thats naive 
walters spoke after representatives of 10 nations including the 
soviet union and nicaragua condemned the us military action 
walters who spoke sharply and in clear controlled anger 
rebuked the earlier speakers who criticized the united states 
the united states is not really disposed to receive lessons on 
terrorism from a nation like sandinista nicaragua he stold the 
council nor is it ready to be taught the norms of international 
behavior by nations governed by various forms of military or 
civilian oneparty dictatorships 
soviet ambassador alexander m belonogov called the us military 
action absolutely unfounded and said it erodes the possibilities 
of peace in the middle east 
nobody attacked the aircraft or ships of the united states 
the soviet permanent representative said we cannot say the us 
is entitled to open fire on aircraft of another state simply because 
those aircraft had come close to one another in internaional 
airspace 
belonogov also said the soviet union would withdraw its navy from 
the mediterranean if the united states does the same 
the soviet envoy said the us claim of selfdefense is 
absolutely unfounded 
he said he united states has not proved that a libyan chemical 
plant is intended for the manufacture of chemical arms 
we cannot agree that the united states should arrogate to 
itself the right to punish or threaten any sovereign state that it 
does not like like libya whatever the pretext the use of force is 
contrary to international law he said

a spokesman for chancellor helmut 
kohl complained friday about how washington and us news media have 
treated a usgerman dispute over what us officials say is a 
chemical arms plant in libya 
the flap over whether one or more west german companies helped 
build the libyan factory has driven another wedge into a widening 
rift between washington and bonn relations between the steadfast 
allies was tested last year by lethal crashes of nato airplanes on 
west germany territory and us insistence on continuing lowlevel 
training flights there 
in one of the sharpest public exchanges between the two countries 
in recent years west german politicians and news commentators 
singled out the us news media for their reports on the libyan 
plant dispute 
the new york times and us news amp world report last weekend 
disclosed allegations that west german italian and japanese 
companies helped build the libyan plant about 60 miles southwest of 
tripoli 
libya says it is used to make pharmaceuticals but washington 
says it is a chemical weapons plant president reagan has said 
military action against the plant is an option 
kohl stepped into the fray on friday when his spokesman told a 
news conference that the us treatment of the affair especially 
the way the news media has handled it had not been useful 
chancellor helmut kohl has let washington know this by the 
appropriate means spokesman friedhelm ost added ost declined to 
disclose the contents of the message which he characterized as 
urgent and friendly 
west german officials said thursday they had found no evidence of 
illegal exports by one company imhausenchemie of lahr they also 
said there is no proof that the plant is designed to produce 
chemical weapons 
however france canada and egypt joined friday in supporting 
us contentions about the plant 
us officials including secretary of state george shultz have 
sharply and publicly criticized bonn for what they describe as 
footdragging in checking into whether any west germany companies 
helped build the plant 
but ost on friday repeated the west german governments claim 
that washington had failed to respond to bonns request for further 
concrete information 
the federal republic west germany as a nation of laws cannot 
operate on the basis of suppositions and suspicion ost said i 
dont want to make any speculation about the possible motivation for 
the campaign by a section of the us news media 
kohl told foreign minister hansdietrich genscher to take up the 
issue with shultz at an international conference on chemical weapons 
that begins saturday in paris ost said 
west german newspapers on friday carried reports on the growing 
tensions between the two countries and the counterattack led by 
volker ruehe a topranking official in kohls christian democratic 
union 
late thursday night the zdf television network the nations 
second largest tv network ran a lengthy news report on the 
controversy moderator peter voss said the harshest allegations were 
published in the new york times which he described as a 
traditional defender of jewish interests 
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in frankfurt reported that 
ruehe suggested closing the goethe institute facilities in the 
united states if the us news media persist in their campaign 
against west germany the goethe institute with offices worldwide 
offers german language instruction and cultural programs 
it was correct to sound the alarm ruehe told the associated 
press in a telephone interview friday he singled out for special 
criticism a new york times column which he said had characterized 
the affair as west german aid helping libya to build an 
auschwitzinthe sand 
the auschwitz concentration camp with its gas chambers was one 
of the most notorious death camps of nazi germany from 194045 
about 4 million people mostly jews died there

president reagan saying he felt fine entered 
walter reed army hospital on friday to prepare for surgery early 
saturday morning to correct a curvature of his left ring finger 
the president accompanied by his wife nancy waved to reporters 
as he entered the emergency room of the military hospital asked how 
he felt the president called out fine 
due to heavy cloud cover the president went to the hospital by 
motorcade rather than by helicopter 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the operation is 
scheduled for 730 am est and doctors expect the president to be 
up and around following the operation 
the presidential physician col john hutton has said reagans 
arm would be numbed for the two to threehour procedure and he did 
not expect general anesthesia to be used 
reagan will remain at the hospital until sunday as a 
precautionary measure fitzwater said to be sure everything goes 
well 
the surgery designed to alleviate an ailment known as 
dupuytrens contracture is considered to be routine and often 
doesnt require an overnight stay in the hospital 
the affliction causes the progressive and usually painless 
contraction of the fingers and occurs due to a thickening of the 
tissue called fascia in the palm of the hand 
the contracture was minimal when reagan took office in 1981 but 
has progressed enough during the past year to require surgical 
treatment hutton said 
fitzwater said he expected the president to wear some kind of 
bandage afterward but that the president was expected to be back 
to work monday 
he has a full schedule for next week fitzwater said 
the president is to leave office jan 20 but the spokesman said 
reagan chose to go ahead with the surgery while still in washington 
because he preferred to make use of the experts in this kind of 
surgery at the military hospital 
he wanted to have it done at walter reed after he leaves 
office of course hes going to california fitzwater said 
the spokesman added that reagan has been putting off the 
procedure for some time even though his doctors had been suggesting 
it be done for several months 
hutton said the physicians involved besides himself would be 
dr george bogumill of georgetown university a consultant at walter 
reed col alan smith and maj paul perlik of the hand service at 
walter reed 
the anesthesiologist will be lt col charles gandy lt col 
lawrence mohr of the white house medical unit and members of the 
department of medicine at walter reed will take part as consultants 
hutton said

nearly 44 years after he disappeared on a 
remote island in alaskas aleutian chain the remains of cpl carl 
bud houston were returned friday to a final resting place in 
wisconsin 
about two dozen relatives and friends attended a brief private 
funeral service for houston whose remains were found last summer by 
biologists studying geese on the island 
uncle bud is finally home and i look forward to meeting him 
some day in the hereafter said jay gitchel who was four months 
old when his 21yearold uncle disappeared 
although he never met his uncle gitchel said older relatives in 
the family spoke so fondly of houston that gitchel named his son 
after him 
houston who grew up in manitowoc in eastern wisconsin 
disappeared march 3 1945 while hiking on buldir island where he 
was one of five volunteers assigned to operate a weather station 
for years army officials and the family believed houston was 
caught in a landslide on the coast of the snowy rugged island his 
body was never found despite ground and aerial searches by his four 
fellow team members 
jacqueline gitchel houstons sister and closest surviving family 
member said relatives never thought his body would be found because 
it was assumed to be buried 
but mrs gitchel was surprised to learn last summer that a us 
fish and wildlife team found a wwii vintage m1 rifle and skeletal 
remains further inland on the 4250acre island 
the remains were found by a woman looking for a stone to pound 
tent pegs mrs gitchel said 
after an investigation by the army military officials confirmed 
the remains were houstons mrs gitchel said 
mrs gitchel said she hoped fridays service at a mausoleum at 
the restlawn memorial park in northcentral wisconsin was the final 
chapter in her brothers story 
mrs gitchel 69 remembered her younger brother as a young man 
who liked to hunt and fish he had worked at a number of jobs taken 
classes at a university of wisconsin extension and worked at a 
manitowoc shipyard before enlisting in 1942 
in the army he received arctic survival training and was 
assigned in 1944 to a weather observation squadron in the aleutian 
islands once he volunteered for duty on the remote island the 
family heard little from him because mail was picked up only about 
twice a year mrs gitchel said 
mrs gitchel said she believes her mother once thought houston 
may have been captued by the japanese 
i think she was sorry she didnt have a grave to take care 
of mrs gitchel said 
before he died in 1980 houstons father talked about going to 
see the island where his son died and wrote to shipping companies 
asking about passage without luck gitchel said 
the father made a real strong effort to get to buldir i dont 
think he realized how remote it is he said

a probe of the worst coal mine cavein 
accident in 2 years began friday with a federal official saying 
that one survivor saw the accident coming but was too late to save 
the three miners who were killed 
he tried to warn the others but the fall came too quick 
us mine safety and health administration spokesman joey lucas said 
thursday of roger wilder 37 of cubbage 
wilder who was operating machinery with an overhead canopy and 
was not harmed in the accident wednesday saw the overhead dipping 
and tried to alert the others when the roof caved in 
wilder was trapped for about 20 minutes until other miners 
cleared fallen rock and shored up the roof lucas said the cavein 
occurred as the men were removing coal about 2400 feet into the 
mine 
the accident was at cumberland valley contractors co incs no 
2 mine the company was formed in late 1986 by stanley ditty david 
howard robert roane and gerald burleson according to clyde goins 
their former employer 
all four were welltrained in safe coal mining and id be 
surprised to find out if they were doing it any differently goins 
said 
the new company has a somewhat average federal minesafety 
record lucas said 
msha records show that the no 2 mine had five serious and 
significant violations in 1987 and four last year all the most 
serious violations msha inspectors cited at the mine were corrected 
during the last msha inspection completed dec 15 only one 
violation was cited a nonserious one involving storage of 
compressedgas cylinders according to records 
federal inspectors have cited the mine for safety violations 24 
times but only one on may 14 1987 involved roof support 
it has absolutely nothing to do with the accident there this 
week said lucas who characterized the 1987 violation as more 
of a paperwork violation 
state mines and minerals commissioner willard stanley said 
thursday that the state and federal investigations would begin 
friday and a spokesman in his office confirmed they had begun 
weve had no problems with getting anything corrected that 
needed to be corrected at the mine stanley said 
the last coal mine accident in which three people were killed was 
july 9 1986 according to kathy snyder a spokeswoman for us mine 
safety and health administration in arlington va

from commoner to royal consort michiko who becomes 
japans new empress has accepted a life in the public spotlight and 
devotion to the imperial family 
michiko 54 is a onetime college valedictorian and the daughter 
of a wealthy but nonroyal flour miller she fired the imagination 
of millions and set imperial precedent when crown prince akihito 
handpicked her to be his wife 
their storybook romance is enough to rival the courtship of 
prince charles and princess diana 
a girl who has both parents living is goodlooking not too 
tall but slender able to make witty remarks a sports and music 
lover and capable of playing hostess at receptions are the 
qualities akihito is said to have specifically sought in his future 
wife 
the girl i marry need not be of imperial or noble blood 
you may not be concerned about such things but if a selection is 
made from a limited field i feel the result will take me away 
further from the people he reportedly told a friend 
michiko was born oct 20 1934 and graduated from the exclusive 
sacred heart university with a degree in english literature she is 
a fluent englishspeaker an avid tennis player and an accomplished 
harpist and pianist 
they met for the first time on a tennis court in 1957 but it was 
not until 15 months and many phone calls later imperial protocol 
prohibits dating that they were wed in a simple shinto ceremony 
michiko and her family initially refused akihitos proposal made 
through his chamberlains she was packed off to europe and the 
united states to attend a college alumni conference in brussels 
before returning to tokyo 
i have just spent in my recent world tour all the money my 
parents had prepared for my trousseau your highness can you 
consider marrying a girl with no belongings except one suitcase 
she is said to have asked of akihito during one of their phone 
conversations after her return 
he fired back why certainly yes maam i do consider 
marrying you even if your possessions amount to just one suitcase 
michiko finally relented not because he is a prince but 
because his sincerity won me over i do love him she said 
akihitos choice ended a sixyear hunt by the imperial 
chamberlains searching for the perfect wife for their prince 
their marriage on april 10 1959 when he was 25 and she was 24 
was celebrated with much fanfare nearly half a million people 
gathered to cheer their horsedrawn cavalcade while thousands more 
bought their first television sets to watch the ceremonies 
the government announced an amnesty for some 210000 people 
charged with minor crimes and one newspaper even came out with 
flowerscented editions to celebrate the occasion 
michiko and akihito have often travled abroad representing the 
emperor and empress to promote international friendship and good 
will she also attends state functions and is honorary 
vicepresident of the japanese red cross 
in march 1986 she underwent surgery to remove a tumor in her 
uterus after suffering from anemia the nature of the tumor was not 
made public but michiko has resumed an active life accompanying 
akihito on a state visit to the united states in october 1987 
on that tour she made a point of seeing louisa may alcott house 
in concord new hampshire because the 19thcentury authors 
little women is popular in japan and she knew tv coverage of 
her visit would show japanese schoolchildren what the alcott house 
was like 
in tokyo michikos life has centered around the crown princes 
togu palace near the moated imperial compound 
i have held and will continue to hold important the words of my 
father when i left home that i should live my life at one heart 
with the emperor and crown prince michiko is reported to have 
said 
in another break from royal tradition michiko and akihito raised 
their two sons and one daughter on their own instead of handing them 
over to chamberlains and nurses as akihitos parents did when he 
was 3 
michiko always sets high value on tenderness in her daily 
life akihito once commented

cambodian president heng samrin said 
friday that vietnam will withdraw the 50000 troops it says are 
still in cambodia by september if a political settlement is reached 
to end the war 
heng samrin echoed previous promises by vietnam which said it 
would remove its troops earlier than its 1990 target date if 
disagreements are resolved through negotiations 
unlike heng samrin vietnam previously has not named a month for 
such a withdrawal 
resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk was quoted as saying 
however that vietnamese pledges of withdrawals are insincere and 
that cambodias future can be settled only by continued fighting 
heng samrin made the pullout offer in a speech in cambodias 
capital of phnom penh to mark his governments first decade in 
power vietnam installed the government on jan 7 1979 two weeks 
after a fullscale invasion of cambodia 
in the speech broadcast by the official phnom penh radio and 
monitored in bangkok he accused the guerrilla opposition of 
prolonging the peace negotiations by making the unreasonable 
demand that the phnom penh government be dismantled before a general 
election is held 
heng samrin repeated that his government wanted a settlement on 
the basis of a vietnamese withdrawal along with measures to prevent 
the former fanatical khmer rouge regime from retaking power 
he said that to contribute to achieving this solution 
vietnam and his government have agreed if there is a political 
solution all vietnamese troops will be withdrawn from cambodia no 
later than september 1989 all the points above should be 
implemented with effective international control 
vietnam says it has made annual partial withdrawals of its troops 
since 1982 it says the largest came in 1988 when the vietnamese 
military high command all advisers and 50000 soldiers returned 
home vietnam says the remaining 50000 troops will be repatriated 
by 1990 whether there is a political solution or not 
the guerrillas demand that the heng samrin government be 
dismantled has been one of the major barriers in the peace talks 
the major peace forums have been meetings in france between 
cambodias prime minister hun sen and sihanouk and multilateral 
talks the second round of which are scheduled in indonesia next 
month 
the khmer rouge radio said sihanouk on jan 1 sent a note to 
countries backing the resistance telling them that the vietnamese 
troop pullout is not real and not unconditional the radio 
broadcast occurred thursday and a text of it was seen in bangkok 
today 
in the note sihanouk said the supposed pullouts were mere 
rotations and about 120000 vietnamese soldiers remained in 
cambodia 20000 of them in the cambodian army also 40000 troops

us ambassador vernon a walters exhibited 
blurred photographs to the security council on friday showing what 
he called a heavily armed libyan mig23 and said us jets shot down 
that plane and a companion mig23 in selfdefense 
libyan ambassador ali sunni muntasser called the photographs 
doctored and said it is completely fake it is untrue 
walters later asked reporters do you think this is a bouquet 
of roses hanging under the wing 
we have photographs which prove that the planes were armed 
he said 
walters passed two photographs around the council chamber where 
libya has sought an emergency session to condemn the us downing of 
its two aircraft on wednesday libya says they were unarmed planes 
on a reconnaissance mission over international waters of the 
mediterranean sea 
the two enlarged photographs show two views of one of the two 
migs the us mission said they are labeled libyan mig23 
flogger one shows a full view of an aircraft with what the united 
states said are two apex and two aphid missiles the other shows a 
portion of an aircraft in the lower right corner 
the missile parts show quite clearly walters said of the 
photos taken from a videotape there were two different types of 
missiles on the aircraft wings and hanging from other parts ofthe 
fuselage 
we have photographs that show the planes were armed walters 
said you can see for yourself whether there were or were not 
missiles 
he said the photos were taken by one of the us f14 tomcats 
that shot down the libyan aircraft the blackandwhite photographs 
were enlarged to about 16 inches by 20 inches and showed blurred 
objects under the wing 
routine operations over international waters were 
aggressively and hostilely challenged by the libyan air force 
walters said 
the session which began thursday was expected to discuss a 
resolution condemning the us action delegates adjourned friday 
evening until 1030 am monday the united states and britain were 
expected to veto any such resolution in any event 
the recordings of the pilots conversations and the photographs 
make it all he more clear that the united states acted in 
selfdefense walters said 
muntasser at first shunned the photographs and brushed them aside 
as they were passed around the council for examination but he later 
said he had examined them and rejected them 
we are in the country of hollywood he told reporters it 
is very welledited very well done and it is not true he quoted 
the new york times which described the videotape as blurred and 
indistinct 
he said the united states could have photographed migs in vietnam 
and used other film 
muntasser said the libyan aircraft were not challenging and 
threatening the us jets the americans are provoking us they 
want us to retaliate and then they will attack libya that is the 
whole reason he said 
walters likened the evasive actions of the us pilots to that of 
a citizen trying to avoid a mugger if you are walking down a dark 
alley and see a man with a pistol walking behind you you cross the 
street and he crosses the street you recross and he recrosses you 
do it five times and he follows you you have to wonder if hes 
going to hand you a bouquet of flowers thats naive 
walters spoke after representatives of 10 nations including the 
soviet union and nicaragua condemned the us military action 
walters who spoke sharply and in clear controlled anger 
rebuked the earlier speakers who criticized the united states 
the united states is not really disposed to receive lessons on 
terrorism from a nation like sandinista nicaragua he stold the 
council nor is it ready to be taught the norms of international 
behavior by nations governed by various forms of military or 
civilian oneparty dictatorships 
soviet ambassador alexander m belonogov called the us military 
action absolutely unfounded and said it erodes the possibilities 
of peace in the middle east 
nobody attacked the aircraft or ships of the united states 
the soviet permanent representative said we cannot say the us 
is entitled to open fire on aircraft of another state simply because 
those aircraft had come close to one another in internaional 
airspace 
belonogov also said the soviet union would withdraw its navy from 
the mediterranean if the united states does the same 
the soviet envoy said the us claim of selfdefense is 
absolutely unfounded 
he said he united states has not proved that a libyan chemical 
plant is intended for the manufacture of chemical arms 
we cannot agree that the united states should arrogate to 
itself the right to punish or threaten any sovereign state that it 
does not like like libya whatever the pretext the use of force is 
contrary to international law he said

emperor hirohito who held divine status until 
japans defeat in world war ii and endured to reign for 62 years 
died saturday of intestinal cancer he was 87 
the governments chief spokesman chief cabinet secretary kenzo 
obuchi said the emperor died at 633 am 433 pm est friday 
shoichi fujimori grand steward of the imperial household agency 
told a nationally televised news conference that hirohito died of 
cancer of the upper duodenum 
the frail monarch who urged his country to surrender after the 
atomic bombing of japan by the united states in the closing days of 
the war had undergone intestinal bypass surgery in september 1987 
at the time his doctors said a growth blocking his intestine was 
not cancerous 
on sept 19 1988 the emperor vomited blood and remained in 
serious condition after that with internal bleeding but until the 
death announcement the household agency refused to confirm local 
news reports he was suffering from cancer japanese custom is not to 
let cancer patients know they have the disease 
crown prince akihito 55 the emperors eldest son immediately 
ascended the chrysanthemum throne at a ceremony scheduled for 10 
am he was to take over three sacred imperial treasures that 
symbolize the throne and have been handed down through generations 
of emperors 
two risingsun flags on the imperial palace were lowered to 
halfstaff the tokyo and osaka stock exchanges suspended their 
usual halfdays trading saturday and japan headed into a mourning 
period that followed much quiet preparation as the emperor lingered 
on his deathbed for 3 months 
the government said foreign minister sousuke uno would continue 
his trip to europe where he is attending a conference on chemical 
weapons in paris in september uno canceled a trip to washington 
and the united nations because of hirohitos illness 
the association governing sumo wrestling the unique japanese 
sport that was one of hirohitos favorite diversions said it would 
postpone until monday a tournament scheduled to start sunday 
the palace set up a place where people could sign a condolence 
register and a trickle of people started to arrive before 9 am 
cabinet members wearing morning coats assembled to decide a 
name for the new emperors reign 
hirohitos reign was known as showa and year showa 64 on the 
japanese calendar had begun on jan 1 
akihito his wife crown princess michiko 54 and other members 
of the imperial family had arrived at the palace at 540 am soon 
after chief court physician akira takagi rushed in to attend 
hirohito 
the worlds oldest imperial line held by the same family since 
at least the 8th century and by legend since 660 bc passed 
automatically to akihito 
the regalia he was to receive consisting of a sword jewels and 
a mirror were said in legend to have been handed down from the sun 
goddess the imperial familys mythic ancestor 
hirohitos funeral likely to be held in about six weeks will be 
a massive event to mark the figurative and literal turning of an 
era since years in japan are numbered from the start of his reign 
in 1926 
akihitos formal coronation will take place in about two years if 
his fathers pattern is followed but the pattern is so old 
hirohito reigned for 62 years and 13 days and japan is so 
different now that precedent may not be followed 
prime minister noboru takeshitas government will be under 
pressure to handle the passage correctly to honor hirohito properly 
without giving too much rein to those who want to restore the 
prewar imperial aura of divinity 
hirohitos reign covered almost half the turbulent times of 
forced modernization repeated warfare and a vigorous rise from the 
radioactive ashes of world war ii that together have made japan a 
formidable world force since it was pried out of its island 
isolation in the 1850s

the state department expressed confidence 
friday that west germany is taking seriously and fully investigating 
american assertions that west german firms have helped libya build a 
chemical weapons production plant 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley repeated the us 
declaration that the plant represents a serious danger 
she said we and other governments are seeking to deny libya 
the foreign assistance we believe is essential for full development 
of this capability 
mrs oakley said that the us information on the role of foreign 
companies in assisting the libyan chemical weapons effort is 
conclusive 
with regard to west germany we are confident that it is taking 
the information we have provided very seriously and is investigating 
fully mrs oakley said it has in the past year vigorously 
pursued and prosecuted such cases 
with regard to the libyan cw program we understand that the 
appropriate west german authorities are still conducting their 
investigations she said 
as with other countries with which we have talked regarding 
this problem this is an ongoing matter west germany has also 
announced that it is reviewing its export control laws we 
understand an interim report on this subject will be presented to 
the cabinet soon 
the comment came in the wake of news reports quoting unnamed us 
officials as complaining that west germany was not moving fast 
enough to respond to the american appeal for cutting off technical 
assistance and critical material which might help libya go into 
actual production of chemical weapons 
mrs oakley was asked about a west german statement that the 
united states was running an unhelpful media campaign to put 
pressure on the bonn government 
i dont have any comment on that she replied i think that 
i have addressed it that we have full and close cooperation with 
the government of west germany and we fully expect that to 
continue 
she was asked whether her statement on behalf of the state 
department had been requested by bonn to clear west germanys 
name and to end complaints of west germany bashing 
that would not be accurate at all mrs oakley replied i 
dont think were in any position of bashing any country were 
working closely with the west german government other interested 
governments on this issue well continue to bring to their 
attention relevant information that assists in their ongoing 
investigations 
its our understanding that the west german investigation is 
not yet complete that theyre continuing to investigate and we 
remain in touch with them on the matter she said 
president reagan interviewed friday on cbs television defended 
wednesdays action by us warplanes in shooting down two libyan 
migs over the mediterranean sea 
that was selfdefense and now its proven by film of the 
planes in the air that their planes were not disarmed reagan 
said their planes were carrying weapons missiles and so forth 
and they were the ones that when our pilots changed the direction 
altitude and so forth they followed every time finally it is 
so apparent that you dont wait for them to push the button because 
then you die

soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said 
the us downing of two libyan jet fighters this week has poisoned 
the atmosphere of an international conference on chemical weapons 
that opens saturday 
he called the incident over the mediterranean unacceptable 
upon arriving at orly airport friday 
there has been speculation that the conference risks being 
dominated by us charges that libya is building a chemical weapons 
plant nations will strive at the fiveday meeting the largest such 
gathering ever held to revive the taboo on the proliferation of 
chemical weapons 
at least 141 nations are attending the conference about 80 of 
them led by their foreign ministers according to french officials 
earlier friday france canada and egypt joined britain in 
supporting us contentions that libya is developing poison gas in a 
factory at rabta 60 miles southwest of tripoli a senior us 
official said 
shevardnadze told reporters it is very important that 1989 
begin with a major event like the paris conference 
asked about the downing of two libyan mig23s on wednesday by two 
us f14s the soviet minister said he felt the incident poisons 
the atmosphere on the eve of the paris conference 
shevardnadze also said american accusations about a libyan 
chemical weapons plant were out of order 
without proof no government has the right to present such 
accusations he said 
however the us official reported added agreement among us 
allies that libya under col moammar gadhafi now is developing 
chemical weapons in its own factory 
us secretary of state george p shultz in paris for the 
conference has said he will try when he meets shevardnadze on 
sunday to persuade the soviets about the nature of the plant and ask 
their help in closing it 
the us official briefing reporters under rules that barred 
disclosing his name said foreign ministers michel rocard of france 
joe clark of canada and esmet abdelmeguid of egypt all told shultz 
in separate meetings friday they did not doubt the libyan plant was 
engaged in producing chemical weapons 
shultz said thursday the plant had not yet actually produced 
poison gas 
president francois mitterrand apparently trying to bring the 
conference back to its original intent told reporters thursday 
night that at the moment there is no ban on producing chemical 
weapons 
the 1925 geneva protocol bans only the use of chemical weapons 
the conference aim is to reaffirm the geneva protocal and press 
delegates now meeting in geneva to resolve problems blocking 
agreement on a universal accord that would forbid use production 
and stocking of chemical arms 
chemical weapons do not constitute weapons of dissuasion 
foreign minister roland dumas of france wrote in fridays edition of 
the newspaper le monde as we know they do not stop war just 
underline its horrors 
shultz said thursday on the plane to paris that the conference 
is a conscienceraising operation to get people to see the 
seriousness of the problem of the use of chemical and biological 
weapons 
the opening session is likely to be tense with shultz facing 
foreign minister jadallah azzuz altalhi of libya in the meeting 
hall at the headquarters of the un educational scientific and 
cultural organization 
the united states has not ruled out a military strike against the 
rabta factory 
us officials say the downing of the libyan jets fighters was in 
selfdefense and not linked to the chemical factory issue 
the united states plans to appeal to industrialized nations to 
deny chemical weapons technology and expertise to libya and approve 
economic sanctions to nations that use toxic arms us officials 
have said 
shultz indicated to reporters the united states may be willing to 
work out a deal with libya that would not require destroying the 
plant 
gadhafi insists pharmaceuticals were being manufactured at the 
complex but shultz contends he has adequate evidence to support the 
us allegation 
capability to produce chemical weapons which us officials say 
has spread to about 20 countries will be a primary topic at the 
conference 
britain said wednesday night that an independent investigation 
led to the conclusion that poison gas was under development at the 
libyan plant 
still west germany and a number of other countries where firms 
are suspected of assisting libya were skeptical 
shultz was expected to meet saturday with west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher 
in moscow on thursday lt gen anatoly kuntsevich deputy chief 
of soviet chemical weapons troops gave his countrys first 
acknowledgement that libya may be able to manufacture chemical 
weapons but he said such weapons would be in quantities too small 
to wage war

public services

a west german newspaper munich abendzeitung said british 
aviation authorities believe the explosive that blew up the boeing 
747 was placed aboard the flight in london rather than in 
frankfurt west germany where flight 103 originated

the outside of the aircraft while it was at londons heathrow 
airport 
west german government press spokesman ulrich strempel said i 
cannot confirm or deny such a report 
nbc news quoted us government sources as saying british 
investigators believe the bomb was in the front cargo hold of the 
aircraft indicating the bomb may have been in luggage that came 
from frankfurt or that someone in london slipped it in with 
frankfurt luggage 
a british department of transport spokesman late friday dismissed 
the reports 
we dont know what the bomb was made of we dont know where 
the bomb was placed in aircraft nor indeed do we know at which 
airport the bomb was placed on board said the spokesman whose

investigation and the british government are grateful for this 
offer the foreign office said the czechoslovak experts are 
expected next week

in prague czechoslovakia on friday reiterated to british embassy 
charge john macgregor that it unequivocally opposes all forms of 
terrorism and has never supplied weapons explosives or any other

adviser rafael pardo traveled friday to a mountainous area of 
southern colombia to meet with m19 leader carlos pizarro they gave

contacts over the past few weeks 
m19 has carried out the most notorious guerrrilla attacks in 
colombia in recent years they included the kidnapping of about 50 
diplomats at the dominican republic embassy in 1980 and the attack 
on the palace of justice in 1985 in which 85 people were killed

japans emperor hirohito was a highly 
respected and dedicated marine biologist whose contributions to his 
field will be virtually immortal other scientists said after 
his death 
the poor man didnt really get to do what he wanted to do he 
had to be emperor first then second a scientist and normal human 
being robert hessler a professor of biological oceanography at 
the scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla said friday 
hirohito died saturday friday in us time zones of intestinal 
cancer he was 87 
he was an expert on invertebrate marine animals and a world 
authority on hydrozoans which are small creatures related to sea 
anemones and corals and which look something like mossy plants said 
william barnacle bill newman another biological oceanographer 
at scripps 
the emperor wrote or cowrote at least 12 books on hydrozoans 
hessler said hirohito was very competent in classifying marine 
animals he collected during summers in sagami bay south of tokyo 
the emperor published his last book on hydrozoans part of his 
series of volumes on the sea animals of the bay shortly before he 
became ill newman said 
the fauna of sagami bay is one of the best known in the world 
because of his efforts newman said by phone from scripps which 
is part of the university of california san diego 
while its not the kind of thing that ever makes the front 
page that kind of science is virtually immortal because the 
descriptions that are made and the names assigned to these newly 
described animals will last forever hessler said people will 
be consulting them centuries from now 
hirohito spent hours often working far into the night in his 
laboratory at the palace in tokyo sometimes he collected specimens 
at the royal summer home on the seashore south of tokyo and gathered 
fungi in the palace gardens 
he was very dedicated in his interest hessler said he was 
no dilettante 
when hirohito toured scripps on oct 9 1975 during his only 
us tour he spent about an hour in the laboratory with hessler and 
newman although hessler said they had expected to spend a full day 
with him 
then all the administrators got into the business and 
insisted on guiding the emperor on various tours hessler recalled 
we entertained him for about an hour in the lab where he 
studied hydrozoans and other things newman recalled he was 
very down to earth he was very impressed and would ooh and 
aah when we showed him something very exciting and new they had 
to drag him away when his time was over

formidable world force since it was pried out of its island

the nations fifth recipient of an abdominal 
transplant of multiple organs died friday and experts said her 
swift decline shows that the procedure for replacing the digestive 
system is still in its infancy 
threeyearold rolandrea dodge was with her parents brandon and 
cyndi dodge of fruitland nm when she died of multiple organ 
failure at 445 pm at childrens hospital of pittsburgh 
the little girl was attached to a respirator and had been in very 
critical condition she really was a tremendous fighter said 
lynn mcmahon a hospital spokeswoman her system just eventually 
shut down 
rolandrea better known as rolly received a new liver pancreas 
stomach small intestine and part of a large intestine nov 29 her 
name was placed back on the transplant waiting list wednesday night 
all five transplanted organs were rejected by the girls natural 
immune system ms mcmahon said because the procedure has been 
performed so few times doctors are not sure why the transplant 
failed 
dr marc rowe the hospitals chief of pediatric surgery said 
tests showed on new years eve that rollys small intestine was 
being rejected by her bodys immune system its not immediately 
known whether any of the other four transplanted organs were 
rejected or if so to what degree he said 
were in areas that are essentially uncharted he said 
what were doing is making tentative steps and then very carefully 
analyzing where weve been and what weve learned before we make any 
decision about the next one when well do one or whether well do 
one 
the deaths of the first four patients and rolandreas decline 
were very disappointing said dr james w williams director of 
transplantation at rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center in 
chicago in an interview before rolandreas death 
but this is what happened in the early days of liver 
transplantation he added 
every organ thats been transplanted has had its early 
problems there are hurdles that you have to go over and along the 
way you have to learn from everything thats been done in order for 
things to progress agreed dr tony dalessandro a transplant 
fellow at the university of wisconsin 
the surgeons who are working with this case are at this point 
feeling defeated ms mcmahon said earlier friday however 
thats not to say they would abandon the concept of multiple organ 
transplants 
rolandrea was born with intractable secretory diarrhea a 
disorder that prevented her intestines from absorbing food and 
liquids she spent virtually all of her short life in hospitals 
earlier friday dr thomas e starzl of the university of 
pittsburgh described rollys chances of survival as slim starzl 
pioneered liver transplants and performed the nations first 
multiple abdominal organ transplant in 1983 that first patient a 
6yearold girl lived only a few hours 
the nations latest such patient calvin oliveira 14 months of 
deerfield beach fla was doing well friday despite a seizure 
earlier in the week and a bout of pneumonia dalessandro said the 
boy received a small intestine and liver dec 31 at the university 
of wisconsin hospital and clinics in madison 
arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics at 
the university of minnesota questions the legitimacy of the 
procedure 
even if it worked well and people were living with a good 
quality of life im still not sure there are enough potential 
donors caplan said its very rare to have someone with five 
good organs 
im also not sure society is going to view giving them all to a 
single person is the best thing to do i dont i think if you can 
spread the organs to more people that is what should be done the 
ethical principle should be to save the most lives 
intestines are particularly difficult to transplant according to 
dalessandro because of the extremely technical nature of the 
surgery the lack of biological markers indicating organ rejection 
and the bowels ability unique among organs to counterattack the 
patients immune system 
williams has performed such operations on two children one died 
three days after surgery the other survived 3 months 
he is seeking a third transplant candidate with short gut 
syndrome a potentially fatal intestinal deformity and whose liver 
is failing as a result of intravenous feedings those were the 
problems experienced by the worlds longest survivor of a 
multiorgan abdominal transplant tabatha foster 3 of 
madisonville ky 
tabatha died last may six months after receiving five organs at 
childrens hospital 
this is an awful devastating hopeless condition in these 
children and the truth is there isnt any treatment for them 
other than transplantation williams said

president oscar arias on friday said 
the jan 15 summit of central american nations should be postponed 
until february to give presidentelect george bush time to develop a 
policy for the region 
but officials from some of the participating countries said they 
still planned to attend the twoday gathering in el salvador 
arias who won a nobel peace prize for spearheading a regional 
peace plan called on his counterparts in honduras guatemala 
nicaragua and el salvador to delay their meeting 
he added that it would be helpful to wait under after the feb 2 
inauguration of president carlos andres of venezuela and ask his 
countrys support in the peace process 
the presidents had planned to discuss reviving the regional peace 
plan they signed in 1987 
arias said the central american leaders should give bush who 
takes office on jan 20 and james baker iii his designated 
secretary of state time to consider us policy in central america 
it would be worth it to postpone the meeting until february 
after the inauguration of mr bush arias said he spoke at a 
press conference friday after giving reporters copies of a letter he 
sent to the other central american leaders 
while the administration of president reagan didnt fully 
understand the plan for peace in central america arias said the 
statements of mr baker make it appear that there is a commitment to 
give diplomatic support to resolving the conflicts in central 
america 
the united states has financed the rebels trying to overthrow 
nicaraguas leftist government it is backing the governments of el 
salvador and guatemala in their conflicts with leftist rebels and 
considers costa rica and honduras strong allies 
in addition to sending the letter arias said he telephoned 
presidents joses azcona hoyos of honduras and jose napoleon duarte 
of el salvador as well as vice presidents sergio ramirez of 
nicaragua and roberto capio of guatemala 
arias said he was unable to contact nicaraugan president daniel 
ortega who was in cuba for the 30th anniversary celebration of the 
communist island states revolution 
arias said he did not ask the central american leaders what they 
thought of his proposal but simply told them why he thought the 
meeting should be postponed 
there was no immediate reaction to arias proposal from nicaragua 
honduran foreign minister carlos lopez said that despite arias 
proposal honduran officials still planned to attend the meeting 
honduras still has the good will to participate in the 
presidents meeting said lopez 
in guatemala vice president roberto campio nicolle said he would 
do everything he could to see the summit takes place as planned next 
week in el salvador 
duarte said he knew nothing about arias proposal if there is 
information like that i dont have it duarte told reporters on 
friday im still preparing for the meeting 
in august 1988 arias told reporters that it was urgent that the 
central american leaders meet in january because it is dangerous 
to let the time pass by

presidentelect bush said friday he will unveil 
ideas for reducing the deficit to a special joint session of 
congress after his inauguration 
and while expressing support for president reagans decision to 
back a 50 percent pay increase for members of congress and other top 
federal officials bush said he may revisit the question when he is 
president 
i dont know whether we can afford anything other than to get 
this deficit under control he said 
bushs transition office later announced bush will nominate 
lawrence s eagleburger as deputy secretary of state and has 
selected his national security adviser donald p gregg as 
ambassador to south korea 
eagleburger is a henry kissinger protege who is currently 
president of kissinger associates the consulting firm founded by 
the former secretary of state 
the gregg nomination could spark controversy because of greggs 
role in the irancontra affair while serving on bushs vice 
presidential staff which he joined in 1982 after retiring from the 
central intelligence agency 
the transition office also announced a string of other 
appointments to top state department posts and several prominent 
ambassadorships including the nominations of henry e catto a 
former white house protocol chief as ambassador to great britain 
and vernon a walters the outgoing united nations ambassador as 
ambassador to west germany 
there was no word from bush on when he will fill his last two 
cabinetlevel vacancies energy secretary and drugczar and aides 
said he still has not made up his mind 
bush fielding questions from reporters at the start of a meeting 
with small business executives also said the irancontra prosecutor 
lawrence walsh did the right thing in moving to drop two key 
charges against oliver north because of national security concerns 
its the proper suggestion and i think he properly found that 
there are legitimate national security interests that need to be 
protected said the vice president who last week was 
subpoenaed by norths lawyers to testify in the case i think he 
did the right thing 
on budgetary matters bush said that with his proposed flexible 
freeze on spending some things will go up and then some things 
must be offset by going down were going to hold the line as we 
reduce the spending side of this budget without raising our 
taxes 
but as for the pay increase he said i am vice president and i 
will be supportive of what the president decides ive done that for 
seven and eleventwelfths years and i dont plan to change now 
when the ball is in my court and the buck is stopping on my 
desk i may have something else to say about matters of this 
nature he added 
asked for details of his flexible freeze bush replied ill 
tell you when i take my message up to a joint session of the 
congress 
bush will not make a formal state of the union address until next 
year but aides say they expect the new president to address 
congress a few weeks after the jan 20 inauguration 
in doing so he will be following the example of reagan who 
wentbefore congress to appeal for his tax and budget cuts in 
february 1981 a few weeks after replacing jimmy carter 
reagan is sending congress a lameduck 12 trillion budget for 
fiscal 1990 on monday administration officials say it will hold the 
deficit to 92 billion in part by cutting domestic programs by more 
than 30 billion 
i wont have time to submit a budget this thick said bush 
holding his hands a foot apart but i will have time to analyze 
the presidents proposals a budget incidentally that will go up 
there without raising taxes and say heres what ill add here 
and take off a little there something of that nature 
but it will be done after i become president i will as ive 
said all along wrestle with that problem and then send the message 
up to the hill and that will start the process 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday the reagan 
budget will propose eliminating 80 programs many of them survivors 
of past reagan hit lists 
i hasten to emphasize that this is a reagan administration 
budget and not a bush administration budget said fitzwater who 
will also be bushs spokesman bush will make some alterations and 
change some spending priorities fitzwater said but this is not a 
goodcop badcop exercise

53 percent bush was asked if there was room for further 
improvement in the jobless rate 
theres a lot of things where we can help in an effort to move 
unemployment lower but one way to not do that is to slow the 
economy down by going out there and raising taxes he said 
bush also metwith new york mayor edward i koch to discuss the 
war on drugs aids housing and other issues 
koch said bush asked him for suggestions on a drug czar and the 
mayor recommended former education secretary william j bennett and

officials say emperor hirohitos state funeral will 
closely follow precedents set 62 years ago when his father emperor 
taisho died and was buried 45 days later 
although there have been many changes since then including 
major changes in the constitution in practical terms there wont be 
many alterations in the funeral rites a palace official said 
before hirohitos death saturday 
if those precedents are followed there will be at least 61 
different ceremonies rites and court appearances extending over at 
least two years many are directly linked to the shinto religion 
for which the emperor by tradition serves as chief priest 
hirohito was considered a living shinto god until he renounced 
his divinity after world war ii and his status was changed to merely 
a symbol of the state in the postwar constitution imposed by 
us occupation authorities 
of the 61 ceremonies the grand state funeral or taiso no 
rei is expected in about 45 days and will be one of three rites 
officially sponsored by the government 
the others are the ceremony held saturday in which the new 
emperor received the imperial regalia and seals and his first 
audience with government officials scheduled for monday 
the other ceremonies and rites are to be conducted by the 
imperial household in legal conformity with the constitutional 
separation of religion and state 
officials say hirohitos body will be placed in a casket two or 
three days after his death the formal state funeral in about 45 
days is likely to include a procession of top officials and foreign 
dignitaries to a royal burial ground palace officials say he will 
not be cremated in a departure from common practice in japan 
at the time of taishos death 6000 people marched in the 
procession and 15 million watched the day of the funeral is 
likely to be declared a national holiday 
government officials avoided discussions of funeral arrangements 
before hirohitos death believing that it was inappropriate while 
he was still battling his long illness 
but the palace official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the imperial household agency was closely studying the 
ceremonies in the past and would base the observances after 
hirohitos death on them 
the 45day period following the death of taisho was probably 
related to the extended time required for foreign dignitaries to 
travel to japan since only boat transportation was available

three military helicopters 
fired rockets and machinegun rounds saturday at dissident moslems 
holed up at a military camp where they repulsed two earlier 
government attacks 
the military launched the attacks after the defense chief said 
the dissidents had killed a general they took captive and may have 
killed a second officer 
the government sent the helicopters in the wake of its ground 
attack earlier saturday with recoilless rifles and automatic weapons 
that failed to dislodge up to 60 moslems from the garrison there 
were no immediate reports on casualties from saturdays assaults 
before the ground attack brig gen braulio balbas said 
government forces hoped to capture the renegades and regain full 
control of the garrison by the end of the day 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa ruled out further 
negotiations with the moslems saying they killed at least one of 
two hostages taken thursday in this mindanao island city about 560 
miles south of manila 
but mayor vitaliano agan said the leader of the dissidents 
patrolman rizal alih sent word through relatives that he wanted to 
surrender 
alih and about 14 supporters seized the camps headquarters 
building on thursday and took brig gen eduardo batalla regional 
commander of the philippine constabulary and his chief of staff 
col romeo abendan hostage after eight of them were ordered to 
surrender and face murder charges in a 1984 incident 
dozens of moslem soldiers and others joined alihs group using 
weapons looted from the camp armory 
on friday de villa ordered his troops to storm the garrison 
after he received reports that batalla had been slain by his captors 
de villa said he also feared abendan had been killed 
during fridays attack tanks and armored personnel carriers 
with guns blazing smashed through the gates ahead of marines and 
commandos flown here from manila 
but the troops were forced to withdraw after the moslems returned 
fire with automatic rifles and grenade launchers they disabled at 
least one armored vehicle 
officials said at least five people were wounded in fridays 
attack balbas said the moslems had suffered casualties too but he 
was unable to give a figure because sniper fire prevented troops 
from canvassing the grounds 
de villa said troops monitoring the captors radio communications 
heard them chanting moslem prayers associated with imminent death 
and concluded the gunmen were ready to die rather than surrender 
theyre ready to run amok de villa said they will not 
leave that place anymore they will die fighting 
but agan quoted alihs relatives as saying alih wanted to 
surrender to the mayor and a moslem city official because he had 
lost two brothers in fridays fighting 
negotiations broke down friday after alih failed to provide 
evidence that batalla was alive alih had said the general was safe 
but de villa told reporters friday that batalla was probably killed 
thursday when the hostage incident began 
alih was charged but acquitted in the november 1984 slaying of 
mayor cesar climaco three weeks after climacos death seven people 
were killed in a marine raid on alihs home 
alih faces murder charges in those deaths last month batalla 
received permission to arrest alih batalla ordered alih and eight 
others detained all of them could be charged with murder or 
conspiracy to commit murder 
in an apparently unrelated incident military sources said six 
marines were killed and two others were wounded saturday during an 
attack by moslem rebels on basilan island about 10 miles to the 
south 
a military report said two rebels were also slain 
about 5 million moslems live in the philippines which has 
population of 59 million half of zamboangas residents are 
christian and half moslem

a former city tax official was charged friday 
in connection with a scheme to underreport millions of dollars in 
taxes for about 80 businesses in this financially strapped city 
prosecutors said 
barry t bergeron was charged with two counts of mail fraud one 
count of extortion and one count of federal income tax evasion 
according to the indictment returned friday 
if convicted he faces up to 35 years in jail and a 112000 fine 
according to the indictment bergeron a former city revenue 
collection supervisor prepared fraudulent business tax returns in 
exchange for monthly payments us attorney john volz would not 
specify the amount of the payments 
the city taxes uncollected would probably be in the millions 
volz said 
new orleans is particularly strapped for cash to erase a 30 
million deficit for 1989 the city council has had to cut spending 
and raise taxes 
volz indicated that a plea bargain had been struck with bergeron 
but would not elaborate no arraignment date has been announced 
volz said that the government could have charged bergeron with 80 
counts of mail fraud one for each of the businesses with which he 
dealt but did not 
none of the 80 business owners were indicted but volz said the 
investigation is continuing and that his office is also looking at 
possible involvement by city elected officials 
in june a federal court jury convicted former city tax collector 
brian eastwold of extortion mail fraud and obstruction of justice 
for taking bribes to reduce a business owners sales tax liability 
the first count of mail fraud stems from bergerons mailing of a 
city sales tax form to the ideal food store 
the second mail fraud charge involves a scheme to help some 
grocery store owners in redeeming unused merchandise centsoff 
coupons for about 66000 volz said that some of the stores in 
bergerons coupon scheme also were involved in underreporting their 
income 
the indictment says bergeron underreported the businesses 
income on federal and state tax returns 
bergeron is also charged with underreporting his and his wifes 
joint 1987 income by 30088 volz refused to connect that money 
with the payments bergeron allegedly received from the business 
owners to prepare their taxes 
people will repay what they owe volz said when questioned 
about possible proceedings against the business owners

mayor marion barry jr made no move friday to 
clear up a discrepancy between his contention that he has passed 
drug tests the past five years and his doctors statements that he 
doesnt remember such tests 
barry who is under federal investigation in connection with a 
drug case targeting a former city employee kept out of the public 
eye friday spending the day in his office while reporters pressed 
his aides for the mayors medical records 
he said thursday ive taken a drug test five years in a row 
as part of routine physical examinations ive released them twice 
a year 
however spokesman john white said he knew nothing of any such 
drug tests and barrys physician vincent j roux said much the 
same thing 
im not sure i have ever given the mayor a drug test roux 
told wusatv i dont remember 
roux said he would not release the mayors medical records 
without barrys authorization 
spokesman white said friday that barry was aware of repeated 
requests for release of the records but he added that he had no 
idea whether the mayor would make the documents public 
barry who has repeatedly denied drug use is facing the worst 
political crisis in his decade as mayor of the nations capital 
after disclosure of the fact that he had been visiting the former 
city employee charles lewis at a washington hotel at a time city 
police were arriving to try and make an undercover drug buy from the 
man 
police left when they learned barry was at the hotel authorities 
have said and a federal investigation is under way barry has 
denied interfering with the citys drug probe but has acknowledged 
calling an assistant police chief who was supervising the drug 
investigation barry said he was only trying to speed up the probe 
white had said that barrys physical examinations included urine 
samples but one medical expert said friday that more than a routine 
test would be needed to find indications of drug use 
the drug tests are so specific drugs wont show up there 
unless the doctor is looking for them said dick bast senior 
technical adviser at the national clearinghouse for alcohol and drug 
abuse information in rockville md they would not show up in a 
normal urinalysis 
most physicians do not have the sophisticated equipment and 
labratory facilities necessary to conduct exhaustive drug tests from 
urine samples bast added 
lewis in his first public comments since the incident was 
quoted as saying the media was conducting a smear campaign 
against him and barry 
lewis comments came in an interview with the virgin islands 
daily news parts of the interview were published in saturdays 
editions of the washington post 
lewis denied in the interview that he had offered drugs to the 
hotel housekeeper as she has allegedly told police 
i wasnt selling nothing i wasnt enjoying nothing and neither 
was the mayor lewis was quoted as saying

libya said friday that 14 us jets 
attacked the two libyan fighters shot down this week over the 
mediterranean not two us planes as washington says 
meanwhile warplanes in position for takeoff appeared on the 
tarmac at tripolis airport and soldiers guarded the fortress of 
col moammar gadhafi who was reported to fear a us attack 
a western diplomat said he was told that gadhafi had ousted his 
military chief but he said the report could not be confirmed he 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
rajab abou dabbous secretary of the libyan information ministry 
told a news conference friday evening that the us account of 
wednesdays air attack was a fabrication 
he said 14 us jets were involved and that the shooting was 
premeditated us officials have said two us jets fired after the 
libyan mig23s pursued them 
the truth is that 14 us planes count them attacked two 
libyan planes on a normal reconnaissance flight said dabbous 
libyan television broadcast similar charges 
libyan officials say the planes were unarmed reconnaissance 
craft but us officials have produced video footage that they say 
shows missiles on the libyan planes 
the atmosphere in tripoli was tense and many residents took 
flight the western diplomat compared the mood in the city to the 
days surrounding a us raid on libya in april 1986 
gadhafi has not been seen or heard from since wednesday when he 
vowed to challenge the united states over this weeks air battle 
tensions between the united states and libya already had been 
high because of us allegations that a plant outside tripoli was 
designed to manufacture chemical weapons libya says the plant is 
for manufacture of pharmaceuticals 
the diplomat said he received a telephone call friday from a 
usually credible source saying gadhafi had dismissed his military 
chief col abu bakr younis jaber 
however the diplomat said he was unable to confirm the report 
and added that such rumors have circulated before he said gadhafi 
reshuffled the military a few weeks ago but it was unclear if the 
military head had been affected 
yugoslavias tanjug news agency said wednesday that gadhafi fired 
his military chief to tighten control over the military in 
anticipation of a us assault 
diplomats in the capital said if true the report could mean 
gadhafi feared his top military leaders might resist his orders in 
the heat of an attack 
the military chief who like gadhafi holds the highest rank in 
the libyan military is one of a handful of survivors of the clique 
that supported gadhafis 1969 coup which overthrew the 
westernbacked monarchy 
at least two mig23 jet fighters sat at tripolis airport friday 
poised to enter the takeoff runway on thursday no military planes 
were seen on any runway 
soldiers with machine guns and protected by sandbags guarded the 
fortified complex of offices and housing where gadhafi makes his 
headquarters in tripoli as usual tanks with mounted antimissile 
guns were parked inside 
the compound ringed by 25foot concrete walls topped by barbed 
wire was a target of the 1986 us raid gadhafis whereabouts were 
not known 
the western diplomat said that on friday as the capital closed 
for the moslem sabbath rumors circulated the united states bombed 
the alleged chemical weapons plant at rabta 60 miles outside 
tripoli 
the fears of a us attack prompted many tripoli residents to 
leave the city 
president reagan has said he would not rule out military action 
against the disputed plant 
the diplomat also said he believed there were contacts between 
the united states and libya through a third neutral country that 
has sufficient relations with both since the air battle he 
declined to name the country or provide further details 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley confirmed thursday that 
libya has attempted some backchannel contacts with the united 
states recently but she refused to define the substance of the 
messages or how they were transmitted 
abc news reported friday that gadhafi last week asked italys 
foreign minister to relay to reagan a proposal to work out a deal so 
the united states would not bomb the plant 
the new york times reported saturday that two weeks before the 
planes were shot down the reagan administration rejected an offer 
from saudi arabia to mediate between the united states and libya 
the diplomat said the government was sending many civilians to 
visit or stay at the plant including schoolchildren 
according to libyan media doctors and nurses have been holding a 
sitin at the factory to defend it and demonstrations have 
occurred there frequently in recent days 
the diplomat said the government apparently wanted to ensure that 
in the event of a raid the plant would appear to be a civilian 
target

michigan officials followed the letter but 
not the spirit of divestiture when they went on an 11thhour buying 
spree snapping up south africanrelated stocks days before a ban on 
such investments took effect 
treasurer robert bowman ordered the december purchases on behalf 
of the states 157 billion pension fund they came just before a 
new law went into effect on new years day and banned new 
investments of state pension funds in companies with south african 
ties 
it makes me sick it clearly goes against the spirit of the 
law said thea todd cocoordinator of the michigan leadership 
coalition for south africa divestment 
he didnt violate anything thats clear but if he were 
clearly in the spirit of it he wouldnt go out and buy right at the 
end said state sen dan degrow a sponsor of the measure designed 
to protest apartheid 
the stock buy was part of 902 million in purchases made through 
a fund that buys in a single package all 478 stocks listed on the 
standard and poors 500 index bowman said adding that threefourths 
of the stocks listed in the index have no south afican ties 
a review of the index indicated at least 94 companies were on a 
list released by bowman last week of companies believed to have 
south african ties and are now offlimits for state investments 
the goal was not of course to buy companies that would 
ultimately be proscribed but this is our last chance to buy the 
index fund he said wednesday 
the spirit of the law wasnt violated because the treasurer 
didnt cherry pick any specific stocks and buy them to violate the 
spirit of the law would be to go out and buy index firms we knew had 
south african ties said robert kolt bowmans spokesman 
topping the list of stocks bought of companies with south african 
ties was ibm 34469961 worth others included general electric 
co 19374122 american telephone amp telegraph co 14986177 
general motors corp 12514653 ford motor co 12075821 
bowman said the state had been in and out of the standard and 
poors fund over the last 18 months and he decided in december to 
beef up its stake in the stock market 
we moved money into the index fund its a way to move a lot of 
money into the stock market and bet on the stock market kolt 
said adding that the treasurers office has a responsibility under 
the law to maximize the return on its investments as well as divest 
of south african stocks 
thomas scott a spokesman for gov james blanchard who endorsed 
the law said bowmans actions dont indicate the administration 
lacks commitment to divestiture 
the governor expects and has no reason to believe otherwise 
that the divestiture law he and treasurer bowman pushed for will be 
carried out according to the full spirit and letter of the law 
scott said 
the new law bars the pension fund from buying stock in companies 
that have ties to south africa and gives it five years to sell off 
stock in those companies which totals 5 billion 
the law also applies to 45 municipal pension funds

when two children who were students in the district were shot to 
death in their home with other relatives 
we know tragedy can strike and it can traumatize children who 
knew the victim were trying to do all we can to work through this

the first book arrived in this arctic 
nation 500 years ago and finns apparently have decided reading is an 
ideal way to spend long dark winters that keep them indoors most of 
the time 
no other country places such emphasis on literature said 
marjaleena rautalin of the finnish literature society its 
obvious everywhere you look foreign writers and critics who visit 
us are constantly surprised 
celebrations pegged to the arrival in 1488 of a volume written in 
latin and printed for the finns in germany were held throughout 1988 
and into january 
she said the extent of the anniversary celebrations reflected 
widespread interest it wasnt just another highbrow cultural 
event it also worked at the grassroots level 
four of five adults in finland read a daily newspaper more than 
83 million books are borrowed annually from 20000 public libraries 
in a nation of fewer than 5 five million people 
the government subsidizes writers and several literary prizes are 
awarded each year the finlandia prize the largest is worth the 
equivalent of 23500 
nearly 9000 books are published each year which the un 
educational scientific and cultural organization says is the most 
in the world per capita unesco statistics for 1986 put the number 
of titles per 10000 inhabitants at 177 compared with 12 in the 
united states 
about half the books published are translations most from 
english 
although the numbers are impressive poet and social critic paavo 
haavikko worries about timidity in publishing and the national 
penchant for concensus 
haavikko who won the 1984 neustadt literature award from the 
university of oklahoma published an eightpoem series in a leading 
magazine in december defining the political climate in finland as 
corrupt 
in an interview haavikko said its not 500 years of the 
finnish book that has been celebrated but a couple of hundred years 
of a closed and stagnant publishing trade 
yes we could say the publishing trade is doing okay but that 
does not necessarily mean we can print what we want there is an 
unwritten agreement to keep ones mouth shut and selfcensorship

archaeologists have unearthed 100 exquisite 
mosaic floors of mythological and geometric design from the glory 
years of paphos as a rich roman trading port and may find as many 
more 
british soldiers discovered the first floor depicting hercules 
about to attack a lion while digging an airraid shelter in 1942 
they covered it up again 
the mosaics made of thumbnailsized cubes of sawn stone called 
tesserae decorated wealthy cypriot homes when paphos was the 
capital of the eastern mediterranean island more than 2000 years 
ago 
they were the ancient equivalent of a fitted carpet and a 
status symbol of the rich in the rooms where they entertained 
said demetrios michaelides the government archaeological officer in 
charge of the 950000squareyard site 
he said in an interview there may be more than another 100 
mosaics on the site 
a second chance find 20 years after the soldiers uncovered 
hercules and the lion led to systematic digging by archaeologists 
they unearthed a mansion filled with mosaics and called it the 
house of dionysus because the god of wine and revelry was prominent 
in the decorations 
three other mansions with spectacular mosaic floors have been 
found in recent years one so lavish it eventually was identified as 
the palace of the roman governor 
its surprising to find a highly developed mosaic art in cyprus 
at a point when it was really one of the empires provincial 
backwaters said christina kondoleon professor of art at williams 
college of williamstown mass who is publishing a book on the 
discoveries 
the designs are lively and creative mosaicists copied each 
other and used pattern books but these are often original with a 
very wide color range she said in a telephone interview 
naturalistic figures are surrounded by borders in floral and 
geometric designs that are based on classical architecture and 
intended to give a threedimensional effect 
scholars agree the mosaics were made of local stone by craftsmen 
influenced by the sophisticated styles of mosaic workshops in 
antioch on the coast of nearby syria 
michaelides said many were laid during a period of great 
prosperity in the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries 
one of the finest shows orpheus a mythological musician whose 
playing was said to tame wild beasts seated on a rock performing 
with his lyre for an audience of animals a tiger leopard deer 
and several others 
it measures 13 feet by 16 feet 4 inches the colors are a 
subtle range of grays pinks and browns 
a later series again of dionysus and his followers in luminous 
colored robes dates from the middle of the 4th century when 
christianity was gaining adherents in cyprus 
ms kondoleon said the dionysus mosaics are certainly making an 
antichristian statement reasserting the old pagan values 
the paphos mosaics have become the islands biggest tourist 
resource attracting more than 250000 visitors a year but it will 
be years before all are on show 
michaelides said the difficulties and expense of conserving and 
displaying mosaics mean you cant go out and dig one up whenever you 
want 
gauze and sacking are glued to a mosaic to keep the tesserae in 
place then it is cut out of the ground 
last summer the orpheus mosaic was lifted in one piece by 
experts from the getty conservation institute in los angeles who 
rolled it around a wooden drum to help keep it intact 
usually you cut the mosaic up in panels on the site and 
reassemble it later but this way theres less danger of damaging 
it nicholas stanley price the archeaologist who supervised the 
operation said in a telephone interview from los angeles 
he said the team will return this spring to unroll the mosaic and 
place it on a special epoxy resin base to reduce humidity before it 
goes on display

so how will journalistpersonality david frost 
make the new syndicated newsmagazine inside edition different 
from those other shows relegated by critics to the trash tv heap 
i think the accent will help he chuckled through a 
cigarsmoke haze indeed there is that clipped british way of 
making everything sound ever so more important than it perhaps in 
point of fact is as it were 
frost who made a twiceweekly commute for that was the week 
that was back in the 1960s will have an easier time of it this 
time hell commute only weekly between his home outside london and 
the manhattan studios of inside edition thanks to the 
supersonic concorde time zones and a helicopter from jfk airport 
he boasts i can leave my house in the country at 830 in the 
morning and be at my office at inside edition at 10 
during an interview frost was positively buoyant bouncing 
around his hotel apartment overlooking central park from telephone 
to roomservice tray and back to the dining table but an english 
reporter doing a profile piece who had flown in with him that 
morning seemed a bit foggy 
inside edition a halfhour weekly series premieres 
tonight it is the first news effort from roger and michael king 
the kings of syndication whose king world distributes wheel of 
fortune jeopardy and the oprah winfrey show 
king world announced inside edition shortly after the highly 
touted usa today the television show premiered in september to 
universally bad reviews and seemed bound shortly for syndication 
oblivion the daily usa today the television show was picked up 
by stations in a whopping 95 percent of the country weeks before its 
premiere proving there was a big market for a new syndicated 
newsmagazine 
the timing of the king world announcement of inside edition 
was not coincidental but gtg entertainment has not folded the usa 
today the television show tent the show has been retooled and 
renewed for another season in an attempt to salvage a 40 million 
investment 
nevertheless inside edition has been picked up in 71 percent 
of the country and king world calls it the hottestselling 
midseason replacement in the history of syndication 
usa today the television show had an impressive cast of 
behindthescenes characters former nbc chairman grant tinker 
gannett and former nbc today show producer steve friedman 
the kings have matched frost with the producers of foxs 
successful a current affair 
frost first arrived on these tv shores in the fab 60s as host 
and cocreator of the satirical that was the week that was he 
has maintained his television presence in this country as host of 
the syndicated spectacular world of guinness records the 
spitting image network specials and the syndicated the next 
president series in which he conducted indepth interviews with 
every 1988 us presidential candidate 
frost has retained his hip tongueincheek image from the days 
of tw3 but he made the seriousinterview hall of fame in 1977 
when he elicited an apology to the nation for watergate from former 
president nixon 
since then he has conducted oneonone interviews with numerous 
world leaders including most recently britains prime minister 
margaret thatcher that interview was excerpted on nbcs today 
show on which frost is a contributor 
in addition to tapping frost for inside edition the 
observant kings grabbed john tomlin and and bob young the producers 
of a current affair an impertinent sensationalistic seedy 
newsmag with a saving edge of selfmockery 
frost hopes the producers will bring to inside edition some 
of that selfmocking quality but he calls the new show a cross 
between a current affair and 2020 abc news quite serious 
magazine show 
inside edition does concentrate on people rather than 
issues its popular journalism in that sort of sense frost said 
its not this week with david brinkley or something like 
that it hopes to be popular journalism but every subject it covers 
will hopefully be reflected through the prism of good judgment as 
it were

perhaps the most easily definable characteristic 
of those individuals and institutions making up the us economy 
today is a feeling of angst it is pervasive 
it has been going on for years now and headline writers have 
just finished packaging it for still another year youve seen the 
type economists relieved by 1988 worry about slump in 1989 
those fears have accompanied six years of uninterrupted expansion 
during which more people have been put to work than ever in american 
history more profits made more dividends paid inflation has been 
restrained throughout 
no matter there are big budget deficits trade deficits bad 
loans shaky financial institutions high but apparently still 
insufficient taxes rising interest rates threats of trade wars and 
more to deny anyone a sense of ease 
as a result optimistic economic forecasters dare not rely on 
their data but instead issue forecasts with asterisks of protective 
qualification to them the white house is always overly optimistic 
its a rule of the game 
on wall street bullish brokers tell clients to be fully 
invested and then issue cigarettepackage caveats and in industry 
in automobiles for instance they lay plans for a big year but 
worry about high interest rates 
individuals worry about the possibility of higher utility bills 
higher interest rates on their variable mortgages higher taxes 
only 20 percent of that credit card interest is deductible this 
year half last years rate 
for the most part these nervous imprints on the brain are the 
very ones everyone had a year ago and the year before that 
indelibly impressed they are now set for another year of carrying 
tensions and fears realistic or not 
in contrast however there are some very good reasons for 
americans to accept some satisfication and relief 
the economy for instance is stronger at the beginning of 1989 
than almost anyone could have forecast one year ago and retained 
respectability the worst did not happen in 1988 the economy 
improved rather than deteriorated 
in spite of all the psychological hangups growth reached more 
than 35 percent and the expansion reached a peacetime record of 
more than six years moreover that growth was in business capital 
investment and exports sectors that the country needed to 
encourage and it came without major complications 
the stock market didnt crash again as feared and now it looks 
a lot stronger than a year ago corporate profits rose sharply and 
so priceearnings multiples shrank to just a little more than 
onehalf their precrash peaks 
the foreigndebt crisis that threatened the stability of the 
nations largest banks is now far less a problem with some strong 
profits banks have raised reserves against losses suspended 
interest payments have resumed 
while far from being corrected the merchandise trade deficit has 
been improving and it cannot be assumed in spite of fears that 
the seemingly insurmountable federal budget deficit wont be 
controlled in a few years 
even the possibility of higher interest rates doesnt generate 
quite the fear it might have a year ago there is a greater 
awareness of the dangers of personal debt people seem to be a bit 
more saving and conservative 
nobody expects very big things from the economy this year and 
they didnt last year either and in fact big things didnt 
happen merely a steady accumulation of good little things and an 
absence of disasters 
that angst everything considered might be the steadiest 
governor the economy can have

mississippi burning the new movie 
that depicts the murders of three civil rights workers 25 years ago 
may never play in the small mississippi farm town where the bloody 
episode took place 
some people have asked me to show it but ive also had church 
groups threaten to boycott me if i do says lula ellis the owner 
of philadelphias only movie theater i havent made up my mind 
folks in philadelphia population 6800 are ambivalent about 
having to relive one of the most sensational events of the civil 
rights era 
even cecil price the former neshoba county sheriffs deputy who 
went to prison for his role in the 1964 slayings of james chaney 
andrew goodman and michael schwerner said he hasnt decided whether 
he will see the orion pictures film scheduled to be released across 
the country next weekend 
im trying to lead a different life now and i just wish all 
that stuff hadnt been dredged up again said the 52yearold 
price who served four years of a sixyear sentence 
im sure everybody involved wishes it had never happened he 
added we just want to forget about it 
philadelphia mayor charles mcclain echoed those sentiments 
i think most people know what happened here mcclain told a 
visiting reporter why dont you all just let us alone 
mcclain who operates a local funeral home said many changes 
have taken place in philadelphia during the past quarter century he 
cited the countys integrated school system the black city 
policemen and firemen and the citys black alderman there also 
are four whites on the city council as evidence that philadelphia 
is not the same place it was when the murders occurred 
people here dont understand why philadelphia is being singled 
out govs george wallace and ross barnett the whole region was 
standing up to what was happening back then there were all those 
busloads of northerners coming down here telling us what do to 
besides he continued it was just coincidence that the 
murders happened here the people who were killed were outsiders and 
the people who did it were too its as if a jetliner had crashed 
here and the people of neshoba county were held responsible 
but retired special agent joseph sullivan who led the fbi 
investigation into the murders has another view of the case 
neshoba was an incredibly closed and racist county he said 
when contacted at his manhattan home the countys law enforcement 
officers knew what was happening the blacks and indians in the 
county were almost supine and practically none of the whites in 
philadelphia would cooperate with us in solving the case we found 
that almost every adult white male in the county had connections 
with the ku klux klan 
sullivan said he recently had seen mississippi burning in new 
york 
its a good cowboysandindians movie but bears little 
resemblance to what actually occurred he said if anybody wants 
to know what really happened they should read florence mars book 
the book witness in philadelphia was published in 1977 the 
author now 65 was one of the few philadelphia residents who would 
cooperate with the fbi 
it was clear something terrible was happening in 
philadelphia she said last week while recalling the days when 
practically the entire county was involved in a conspiracy of 
silence 
mars a member of a prominent neshoba county family testified 
before the federal grand jury investigating the murders she also 
spoke out against the klan and urged local officials to acknowledge 
what had happened in philadelphia 
as a result the klan staged a boycott of her stockyard that 
forced her out of business 
mars says there have been many tremendous and positive changes in 
her community since the jim crow days when blacks were likely to be 
beaten or even hanged for angering a white person but she also says 
some people steadfastly refuse to admit the community did anything 
wrong 
of the 18 people that eventually were arrested and charged in 
the case nine were from neshoba county she noted and that 
included the sheriff the sheriffelect and the chief deputy 
the other nine were from the meridian and laurel to the south of 
philadelphia 
and they were invited to come into the county observed 
beatrice cole an 85yearold black woman from nearby mt zion she 
still vividly recalls watching a group of klansmen beat her husband 
nearly to death on the night of june 16 1964 just five days before 
the murders of goodman chaney and schwerner 
we had just come out of church and the whites were waiting for 
us she said they thought wed been having a meeting with 
schwerner to talk about registering negroes to vote but it was just 
a regular church meeting thats all 
the klansmen some wearing black robes dragged her husband jr 
bud cole from his car and began beating him with clubs 
i got down on my knees a few feet away and started praying 
mrs cole said the leader saw me and told the others not to kill 
my husband 
later that night the mt zion methodist church was burned to the 
ground 
nothing was ever done about the fire nor about the beating of 
my husband mrs cole said thats the way things were 
the coles did meet with goodman schwerner and chaney on the 
21st the three had come to mt zion from their home base in 
meridian to investigate the burning of the church 
earnest kirkland who lives near the coles was the last friendly 
face that the three workers were to see 
they ate sunday dinner at my parents house that afternoon 
kirkland said then they gave me a ride down the road to a 
friends house and headed back to meridian but they never made it 
what happened was that price had been tipped off that the three 
were in the county he arrested them on a traffic charge and took 
them to the neshoba county jail 
chaney a 21yearold black man was from meridian schwerner 
24 and goodman 20 were from new york goodman a summer 
volunteer had arrived in mississippi the previous day 
after being held for several hours the three prisoners were 
permitted to post bond but when they left the jail escorted by 
price a klan group intercepted them killed them and buried their 
bodies in an earthen dam on the outskirts of town 
the fbi found the bodies 44 days after the killings they were 
guided by a tip from an informant who was paid 30000 
the informant was never identified 
but everybody was suspicious of everybody else mars 
recalled and for months everybody was watching to see if anybody 
bought a new car or started spending money they shouldnt have 
when the state of mississippi failed to prosecute the case the 
federal government stepped in and charged 18 men with conspiring to 
violate the victims civil rights eventually seven were convicted 
and given sentences ranging from three to 10 years

lawrence rainey the neshoba county sheriff at the time of the 
murders was acquitted the jury was unable to reach a verdict in 
the case of eg hop barnett the sheriffelect 
rainey now works as a security guard in meridian barnett is 
retired and price is employed as a driver at a philadelphia 
trucking company owned by olen burrage on whose land the bodies 
were found 
burrage who was among those tried and acquitted declined to 
discuss the case as did barnett 
but rainey who is employed by a blackowned company still 
maintains his innocence he said the news media have always 
portrayed him as a racist but as sheriff he merely upheld the law 
as he saw it 
rainey who was hounded from several jobs by the naacp also said 
he doesnt expect mississippi burning will cause him any 
problems given that he is employed by a black man now 
carolyn goodman andrew goodmans mother says she thinks a 
greater effort should be made to remember what happened in 
mississippi 25 years ago so nothing like that will ever happen 
again 
the city of philadelphia however has done nothing to 
commemorate the deaths mayor mcclain says he sees no need for any 
observations or monuments since the victims were all outsiders 
really there isnt much talk about what happened any more 
said earnest kirkland now 55 the only white person who ever 
mentioned it to me was a young boy out at the plant where i work 
he asked me did it really happen i started to tell him to 
go ask his daddy but i just said yeah it really happened

with the same visions of stardom that carried 
scores of farm girls to this town in years past foreign investors 
today are migrating to hollywood to make it big in the entertainment 
industry 
japans sony corp has been trying to purchase film studio mgm 
for months without success british broadcaster television south plc 
acquired television producer mtm enterprises for 310 million in 
july australian businessman alan saffron bought film producer 
atlantic entertainment group on dec 13 
and just last week a group of japanese investors committed 50 
million to build a small movie studio here 
numerous other overseas buyers flush with cash and bolstered by 
strong currencies have their checkbooks unholstered waiting for 
the right moment to join southern californias movers and shakers 
i predict that over the next three to five years youre going 
to have two or three major studios change hands said steve 
rosenberg president of entertainment consulting firm rose media 
i truly believe that the japanese will at least own one of them 
and maybe the germans will own another 
you get the glamor and glitter to some extent but there are 
also investment characteristics said nancy schwalb whose star 
partners arranges limited participation in films such as a fish 
called wanda 
investors from austraia japan france and canada schwalb said 
are interested in the industry because its so strong and they 
appreciate the growth 
even though the film industry is enjoying record profits several 
large and small film studios are desperately in need of money 
there are a lot of companies in serious trouble or potentially 
serious trouble said charles meeker head of the entertainment 
division at law firm white amp case 
cocacolas columbia pictures for one has floundered recently 
and is rumored to be for sale mgm sits dead in the water atlantic 
entertainment just purchased by saffrons kvc video for an 
undisclosed sum was left destitute by boxoffice busts like patty 
hearst and 1969 
yet the continuing deregulation of european television and the 
boom in overseas vcr sales 60 percent of japanese homes have vcrs 
have created a nearly insatiable demand for us programming 
american television shows and movies even domestic bombs like 
airwolf and rambo iii have a remarkable ability to draw 
audiences in most foreign countries 
theres a major change in the regulatory environment in europe 
and theres an excess of japanese capital looking for a home said 
harold vogel an entertainment industry analyst at merrill lynch 
capital markets the combination of those two things means that 
foreign money will move toward the domestic film business 
entertainmentindustry investments give electronic manufacturers 
an unbeatable opportunity to create fullservice companies sonys 
recent 2 billion purchase of cbs records for instance yielded a 
firm with both hardware record tape and cd players and software 
the epic columbia and portrait record labels 
were looking at hollywood because of our interest in video 
precisely the same reason we looked at cbs records because of our 
interest in audio said michael schuloff sonys vice chairman 
following sonys model japan entertainment conglomerate tokuma 
group has opened a los angeles office scouring the city for related 
investment opportunities 
mainly we are now looking for video rights for movies to 
show in japan said hiro iijima general manager of tokumas north 
american operations in the future we would like to get 
theatrical motion picture television and home video rights 
the easiest way to do that of course is to buy a studio already 
owning such rights 
the foreign equation can work both ways a few leading 
programmers disney nbc have begun spreading their franchises 
overseas so far though the advances have been tentative but i 
think youre going to see the successful us studios make major 
moves into foreign markets meeker said 
yet blindly snapping up an entertainment rilous 
as attending a jerry lewis film festival 
sony pictures a tiny movie company now disguised as svs films 
has yet to become a successful producer sony removed its name from 
the enterprise whencompany is as pe its releases including a lowbudget 
slasher 
film called party line threatened to tarnish sonys golden 
corporate image 
svs latest theatrical release an exploitation film called 
vicious will not establish sony as a highbrow producer the 
movie playing in just a handful of theaters is described by the 
entertainment newspaper variety as ludicrous a violent 
cheapie featuring a vulgar screenplay 
entertainment is clearly more risky than other loan 
investments but thats not to say that its necessarily 
outrageous said william newby assistant vice president in the

the holiday spirit reawakened in consumers this christmas 
sending shoppers into the stores and giving retailers their best 
performance in nearly two years 
sales were very strong walter loeb a retail industry 
analyst with morgan stanley amp co said thursday after the nations 
largest general retailers announced their sales results for december 
retailers had sales above their own expectations he said 
jeffrey edelman an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
agreed saying it turned out to be a good christmas 
analysts estimated industrywide sales rose in a range of 6 
percent to 75 percent an improvement over the 6 percent gain 
forecast before the start of the season 
the outcome came as a surprise because retailers mired in a 
sales slump since early 1987 expected their customers to continue 
shopping cautiously this season consumers burdened by debt and 
paying more for services and necessities have been forced to cut 
back on their retail outlays 
but as it turned out consumers are in a mood to spend said 
analyst monroe greenstein at bear stearns amp co 
this christmas contrasted with the 1987 holiday season when 
retailers were forced to slash prices to lure reluctant consumers 
into the stores 
strong gains were evident in all segments of the industry even 
at the higher end of the economic scale neimanmarcus group inc 
said sales at its stores open at least a year known as samestore 
sales in the industry were up a strong 122 percent from december 
1987 
apparel retailers continued their comeback from a yearlong sales 
slump limited inc a leading clothing retailer said its 
samestore sales soared 28 percent 
but even with a good christmas many retailers will show 
lackluster fullyear sales when fiscal 1988 ends later this month 
several storeowners have had trouble keeping up with inflation 
which increased at a rate of 44 percent for much of the year 
the analysts said the companies nevertheless should have 
favorable fourthquarter earnings because they stocked their shelves 
conservatively and had fewer price markdowns than a year ago 
jeffrey feiner an analyst with merrill lynch amp co predicted 
retailers would post earnings increases of 10 to 15 percent for the 
quarter the final quarter is crucial for retail companies because 
they generally earn half their annual profits during this period 
industry watchers were split over whether consumers would 
continue their december shopping spree into 1989 economists monitor 
consumer spending as a barometer of economic health because it 
accounts for twothirds of the gross national product 
sears roebuck and co the nations largest retailer said its 
overall december sales rose 121 percent while its sales for the 
cumulative 48 weeks were up 71 percent sears samestore sales 
were up 84 percent for the month and 32 percent for the fiscal 
year to date 
retailers and industry analysts believe samestore sales are a 
more accurate measure of a companys performance than figures that 
include sales from new stores not all retailers report samestore 
sales 
k mart corp said its overall sales were up 107 percent for the 
month and 65 percent for the year to date samestore sales rose 
68 percent last month and 28 percent so far this year 
walmart stores inc said its overall sales rose 31 percent in 
december and 29 percent so far this year the discount retailer 
reported samestore sales gains of 14 percent for the month and 12 
percent for the year to date 
jc penney co inc said its overall sales fell 15 percent for 
the month and 02 percent for the 48 weeks samestore sales were 
down 36 percent in december and 17 percent for the year to date 
penney attributed its recent sales decline to the fact it had 
discontinued several merchandise lines over the past year penney 
said it would have recorded a gain if sales from the discontinued 
items had been excluded from its yearearlier results 
greenstein of bear stearns said penney may also have been too 
conservative with its inventory leaving its stores with too little 
merchandise 
dayton hudson corp said its overall sales picked up 126 percent 
during december and 143 percent for the year to date its 
samestore sales rose 66 percent for the month and 27 percent for 
the 48 weeks 
may department stores co said its overall sales rose 30 percent 
last month and 187 percent for the year to date samestores sales 
were up 10 percent in december and 35 percent so far this year 
fw woolworth co reported overall sales increases of 147 
percent for the month and 123 percent so far this year woolworth 
said its samestore sales rose 93 percent in december and 64 
percent for the 48 weeks 
montgomery ward amp co said its sales rose 76 percent in december 
and 44 percent so far this year 
the results were from the biggest general merchandise and apparel 
retailers unlike monthly retail sales figures released by the 
federal government they do not include sales at auto dealers 
supermarkets or restaurants

jerry samuels an energy analyst with shearson lehman hutton

technical factors and general optimism that the 13nation 
organization of petroleum exporting countries will adhere to new 
output quotas that took effect jan 1 
the market appears to be giving opec the benefit of the doubt 
at least until we see the actual production figures samuels said

after pleading innocent to fraud charges 
takeover speculator paul bilzerian said he hopes to clear his name 
and resume hunting for companies to buy 
my role going forward was to have been and should still be to 
look for further acquisitions bilzerian told reporters thursday 
after his arraignment in federal court in manhattan 
bilzerian which is also chairman of singer co was indicted 
dec 21 by a federal grand jury on a dozen felony counts linked to 
four failed takeover situations in 1985 and 1986 the charges are 
part of a network of securities fraud prosecutions tracing 
indirectly back to the ivan boesky insider trading scandal that 
broke more than two years ago 
the 38yearold financiers lawyer arthur mathews told 
reporters his client will be cleared 
mr bilzerian is innocent its unfortunate these charges were 
brought its burdensome to defend them but they will be defended 
and he will be vindicated mathews said 
after bilzerian entered his plea he was ordered to entrust his 
passport to mathews he was freed on a 500000 personal 
recognizance bond pending trial scheduled for may 1 before us 
district judge robert j ward the trial is expected to last six to 
eight weeks 
none of the charges relate to bilzerians takeover of singer a 
defense contractor he acquired a year ago for 106 billion after a 
protracted struggle 
that takeover marked bilzerians first major acquisition and he 
has since been selling off parts of the company bilzerian told 
reporters thursday that his indictment is really not having any 
impact on singer 
a former real estate speculator who resides in tampa fla 
bilzerian is one of the most prominent figures to be implicated thus 
far in an expanding federal crackdown on securities trading abuse 
he was accused in the indictment of a pattern of violations that 
helped him amass millions of dollars in wealth through hostile 
takeover maneuvering aided in part by jefferies amp co a los angeles 
brokerage that allegedly bought stock on bilzerians behalf under a 
secret illegal arrangement 
the companies allegedly targeted by bilzerian were hammermill 
paper co hh robertson co cluett peabody amp co and armco inc 
evidence for the indictment was partly supplied by boyd l 
jefferies founder of the jefferies brokerage who himself was 
implicated in securities fraud in early 1987 by boesky the 
nowimprisoned inside trader who turned states evidence in exchange 
for lenient treatment

the pressure is mounting on drexel burnham 
lambert incs highyield bond financier michael milken to strike a 
plea deal with prosecutors who have been investigating his financial 
dealings 
sources familiar with the negotiations who spoke on condition 
they not be identified confirmed on thursday press reports that his 
firm agreed to expel him and withhold his 1988 compensation as part 
of its record settlement of criminal fraud charges 
milken one of the most powerful financiers of the 1980s is 
expected to be indicted on fraud and racketeering charges shortly 
unless he agrees to plead guilty in exchange for more lenient 
treatment 
but milken has repeatedly asserted innocence 
drexel which had stood by milken for more than two years in 
asserting innocence agreed to plead guilty to charges stemming from 
its links with the nowimprisoned inside trader ivan f boesky 
the nations fifthlargest investment firm said it would pay a 
record 650 million in fines and restitution admit guilt to six 
felony counts and cooperate in the governments expanding probes of 
wall street corruption in effect making drexel a source of evidence 
against milken 
the financier has faced tremendous pressure to reach a plea 
agreement because of drexels reversed position but lawyers said 
his expulsion from a firm he helped build into a powerhouse 
compounded by the withholding of compensation due him provided even 
more of an incentive for him to capitulate 
the pressure mounting on milken is just so intense now said 
one former assistant us attorney now in private practice in new 
york hes getting it from all directions 
milken is said to be one of the wealthiest investment bankers in 
the country but forfeiture of his lucrative annual compensation 
from drexel could seriously crimp his legal warchest for fighting 
criminal charges 
he has never disclosed his annual compensation but once was 
quoted as saying he has paid hundreds of millions of dollars in 
taxes and given millions more to charitable foundations 
milken and his small team of aides reportedly earned more than 
250 million in annual bonuses alone in 1986 he also is said to own 
a 6 percent interest in drexel which is privately held but 
extremely profitable it was unclear how his expulsion from the firm 
would affect that stake 
drexels settlement of criminal charges reached dec 21 with the 
manhattan us attorneys office was contingent on a jan 10 
settlement of parallel civil charges against drexel filed by the 
securities and exchange commission 
senior emissaries from drexel have been meeting with sec officers 
in washington to negotiate the settlement where terms of milkens 
departure were said to be reached a source familiar with those 
discussions said thursday they have been without acrimony and 
positive in spirit 
the wall street journal reported thursday that the sec was 
seeking to alter the structure of drexels operations in socalled 
junk bonds the highyield debt securities pioneered by milken into 
a 175 billion market 
quoting unspecified sources the journal said sec negotiators 
want drexel to transfer supervision of the junkbond unit which is 
based in beverly hills near milkens home to new york where drexel 
is headquartered 
in addition the journal said the sec wants to approve a 
compliance officer that would monitor drexels trading operations 
and other activities 
drexel spokesman steven anreder declined to comment on any aspect 
of the negotiations with the sec kenneth lerer a public relations 
executive who speaks on milkens behalf also declined to comment 
sec spokesman chiles larson said the enforcement agency was not 
commenting on the drexel matter

a top lawyer defending gaf corp against stock 
manipulation charges hammered away at the credibility of the 
governments star witness who admitted hed discarded records that 
documented the alleged crime 
defense attorney arthur limans grilling of former securities 
broker boyd jefferies dominated thursdays session in the trial of 
gaf and one of its senior officers now in its third week at 
manhattan federal court 
the defense also repeated an earlier request for a mistrial on 
grounds the government withheld evidence suggesting a key document 
was tampered with us district judge mary j lowe declined to rule 
on the mistrial motion and gave no indication when she would do so 
the trial has attracted widespread interest because gaf and vice 
chairman james sherwin are the first defendants in a federal 
crackdown on securities fraud to reach the trial phase they have 
vowed to vindicate themselves 
in addition gaf also is the first industrial concern implicated 
in a network of criminal probes emanating from the 1986 downfall of 
inside trader ivan f boesky now serving a threeyear prison term 
for securities fraud 
the trial also marks the court debut of jefferies himself a 
victim of boeskys disclosures to federal prosecutors jefferies is 
the lead witness in the gaf case and at least two other prosecutions 
he has claimed his los angeles brokerage jefferies amp co 
arranged to manipulate up the price of union carbide corp stock in 
late 1986 at the behest of gaf which had abandoned a takeover 
attempt of the larger chemical company and wanted to sell its chunk 
of carbide at a maximum profit 
jefferies testified earlier this week that sherwin had guaranteed 
his brokerage against loss for the alleged manipulation jefferies 
ultimately lost about 40000 and sherwin promised to pay it through 
a phony invoice for investment banking charges the broker testified 
under limans crossexamination jefferies admitted hed thrown 
out records kept on legalsize yellow pads of the transaction after 
he was implicated in securities fraud by boesky jefferies agreed to 
turn states evidence on march 16 1987 about five months after the 
alleged manipulation took place 
yes they the legal pads were thrown out jefferies said 
my secretary and i cleaned out my office on march 30 1987 
he described it as a routine housecleaning 
under further questioning jefferies said he couldnt remember 
why the alleged agreement with gaf wasnt included in details of a 
plea bargain he made with the securities and exchange commission and 
federal prosecutors 
the 58yearold broker resigned from jefferies after boesky 
implicated him in securities fraud jefferies himself has agreed to 
plead guilty to two felony counts for which he could face a maximum 
sentence of 10 years in prison and 500000 in fines

the north american international auto show may be 
intended as a showcase for domestic and foreign automakers but 
gadgets also on display such as compact disk players television 
sets and other electronic devices are themselves a tribute to high 
technology 
recent advances in computer chips are the reason for the 
explosion of gadgets being exhibited alongside the 700 or so 
vehicles at the seasons first automotive show 
dozens of cars have onboard computers that buzz flash or beep 
to tell drivers about engine performance fluid levels and the 
climate inside and outside the vehicle without chips these gadgets 
wouldnt exist 
one of the most complicated items is an optional video display 
screen inside an oldsmobile toronado trofeo that can help a driver 
keep track of dozens of things ranging from how much oil is in the 
crankcase to what appointments he has scheduled the next day 
by touching the screen at the center of the dashboard a driver 
or passenger can change the radio station alter the temperature in 
the car or learn the compass direction in which the car is traveling 
but the screen doesnt come cheap its a 3000 option that 
until may can be had for 2000 theres a mock up of a front seat 
and dashboard in the oldsmobile exhibit in cobo hall here so 
showgoers can see how it works 
other cars including some made by the acura division of honda

a federal probe arising out of shady dealings 
that surfaced during the market crash of october 1987 has taken the 
governments crackdown on securities fraud in a new direction 
officials say 
the crackdown that began in 1986 already has resulted in several 
wellpublicized cases of insider trading and other securities abuse 
but the stock market crash unveiled a new breed of manipulators 
according to authorities who on thursday described the case of 
stanley aslanian jr 29 former president of a nowdefunct 
securities firm the haas securities corp 
stocks pushed by the company surged during the oct 19 1987 
crash but then the company faltered and the investigation began 
once haas went out of business nine days after the crash as 
customers complained assistant us attorney peter lieb said 
now officials say he has promised federal investigators he will 
assist their probe of his firms actions 
the heady days of preoct 19 gave birth to this case his 
lawyer kalman gallop said it is probably one of 1000 tragedies 
from that day 
the stock manipulation undertaken by the 75yearold company with 
12000 customers and four offices nationwide is indicative of 
similar problems in the industry authorities said 
we have seen a proliferation of these kinds of activities since 
the crash james c esposito an assistant deputy director of the 
fbi said at a news conference at us attorney rudolph giulianis 
manhattan office 
most of the notable securities cases have stemmed from the 
insider trading scandal that started with the guilty plea of dennis 
b levine in 1986 
the new investigation by the fbi securities and exchange 
commission and the us attorneys office begins with aslanian who 
was expected to plead guilty in us district court in manhattan to 
one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud by manipulating 
stock giuliani said 
the defendant faces up to five years in prison and 250000 in 
fines 
giuliani said he hoped aslanians deal would encourage others 
to do what mr aslanian did its a very significant and helpful 
thing to do 
haas securities went out of business oct 28 1987 after 
aslanian was involved in manipulating millions of dollars worth of 
stocks officials said 
gallop said haas securities is now in chapter 7 liquidation 
proceedings in bankruptcy court in manhattan 
gallop said millions and millions of dollars were involved 
but profits could not be easily determined aslanian declined to 
comment 
lieb said the case involved the manipulation of four stocks ts 
industries from the salt lake city area big o tires flores de new 
mexico and cliff engle ltd 
the information alleges that the scheme lasted from june 1985 
until november 1987

soybean and corn futures prices opened a bit 
higher today on the chicago board of trade but wheat futures 
retreated slightly reflecting nervousness about next weeks 
agriculture department crop report 
the report which is due out on wednesday afternoon will contain 
the governments first estimates of 1989 planted acreage plus new 
grainsurplus tallies and the final 1988 crop production numbers 
analysts said the early strength in the soybean market stemmed 
from strong spot prices for soybean meal possibly linked to new 
purchases by the soviet union 
the usda has denied rumors that it plans to expand to 20 million 
metric tons the maximum amount of us grain the soviets may 
purchase annually under the longterm grain agreement between the 
united states and the soviet union 
but analysts say such an expansion is almost certain since the 
soviets already are approaching the current maximum of 16 million 
metric tons 
our sources feel there is a high probability the maximum will 
be extended said steve freed a grain market analyst with dean 
witter reynolds inc in chicago we feel its a done deal 
in early trading wheat was 1 cent to 1 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 447 a bushel corn was unchanged

william collins plc said friday it would recommend 
shareholders accept a takeover bid by publisher rupert murdochs 
news international plc which values the british publishing company 
at 725 million 
news international a subsidiary of murdochs news corp has 
provided collins with assurances of editorial independence which it 
had sought in exchange for recommending the takeover bid 
collins will remain free to pursue its existing editorial 
policy of publishing authors with a wide variety of beliefs and 
views news international said in a statement 
news international said it controls 54 percent percent of 
collins voting stock and has offered 1584 a share for the 
remainder of the collins shares it doesnt already own 
news international originally bid only 527 million for collins 
an offer scorned by the publisher as ludicrously low 
but murdoch raised his offer by 37 percent to 725 million 
following an identical rival bid by groupe de la cite frances 
second largest book publisher 
groupe de la cite approached news international on wednesday with 
an improved offer for collins on condition the murdoch group would 
sell its voting stake in collins but news international refused and 
the french firm withdrew its offer 
news international a publisher of newspapers and magazines in 
britain first gained a major stake in collins in 1981 in an earlier 
takeover attempt 
trade and industry secretary lord young said early thursday that 
he would not refer the news international bid to the monopolies and 
mergers commission which has the power to prevent mergers deemed 
harmful to competition 
bryan gould the opposition labor partys trade and industry 
spokesman called on the government friday to halt the takeover and 
refer murdochs entire media empire to the commission 
government indifference to rupert murdochs bid for the 
publishers collins underlines once again that tory media supporters 
are immune from any normal competition policy gould said in a 
letter to young 
press media and publishing businesses are already far too 
concentrated in this country with rupert murdoch the worst 
offender he said 
murdochs media empire spans the globe with television 
newspaper and magazine interests concentrated in the united states 
and britain 
murdoch owns five national newspapers in britain the times of 
london the sunday times today news of the world and the sun and 
has interests in satellite television 
around midday on the london stock exchange news international 
shares were up 1 penny 2 cents at 214 pence 385 while collins 
shares were off 12 pence 22 cents at 870 pence 1566

markets 
last month citicorp and smith barney harris upham international

gold bugs lost their shirts in 1988 but investors 
in small fastgrowing companies scored healthy gains according to 
a tally of the best and worstperforming mutual funds 
the kaufmann fund scored the years biggest gain 586 percent 
through a strategy of picking small companies that showed potential 
for rapid growth 
in contrast 15 of the worstperforming mutual funds invested in 
gold mining companies or other companies involved in gold and 
precious metals 
the fund at the bottom of the list american asset yield which 
lost 546 percent was an exception to the gold rule the fund with 
assets of less than 100000 tried to focus on companies that pay 
big dividends 
the results are from a quarterly survey by lipper analytical 
services inc the tally assumes that investors reinvest all 
dividends and capital gains distributions that the funds pay out 
of the 20 categories the top 15 were closely bunched in 
performance with average growth ranging from 1105 percent for 
health and biotechnology funds to a high of 1899 percent for 
smallcompany growth funds 
while there were some exceptions in general 1988 was a 
remarkably normal year said a michael lipper the firms 
president 
the only category that declined in 1988 besides gold was 
adjustable rate preferred funds which fell 230 percent far less 
than the average decline oof 1454 percent for goldoriented funds 
gold funds are notoriously erratic in 1987 the year of the 
stock market crash they outperformed all others to post a 3566 
percent gain 
the kaufmann fund although it came out on top for 1988 has an 
erratic history the 2yearold fund has slightly more than 5 
million in assets and more than half its assets are in less than 10 
stocks the wall street journal said friday

west virginias securities division said 
friday it will use subpoena powers if necessary to force wall street 
brokers to reveal how much in commissions they made from a state 
fund that lost an estimated 212 million in 1987 
in addition the state is asking the securities and exchange 
commission to investigate possible wrongdoing in the case state 
securities chief jack hall said 
we mean to look closely at the relationship between the brokers 
and the people who conducted the transactions there were a 
tremendous number of trades conducted and a large amount of 
commissions generated hall said im going to attempt to find 
out how much in the way of commissions were generated 
hall said he has forwarded to the sec substantial amounts of 
material concerning the losses in the consolidated investment fund 
in april may and june 1987 
by dec 31 1987 the fund had 178 billion but it had 
undergone sales during the year of 805 billion treasurer a james 
manchin said his office did not keep a record of the commissions 
made by the 42 brokerage firms handling transactions during that 
period 
state republican party chairman edgar hike heiskell suggested 
on dec 20 that the us attorneys office investigate whether the 
fund was being churned a brokerage term used to describe 
massive purchases and sales that produce no profit for the 
portfolio but handsome commissions for brokers churning is illegal 
us attorney michael carey has confirmed his office is involved 
in the investigation 
hall said his office began calling brokerage houses friday to 
tell them he wants the information 
hall said he will follow his initial telephone call with a 
letter asking each broker to send the commission information within 
five to 10 days 
were going to demand they be forthcoming on all 
transactions hall said 
hall said the sec is reviewing material he sent to the office to 
determine whether federal securities laws have been violated 
the independent auditing firm touche ross amp co which initially 
uncovered the losses in november is expected to make its final 
report public in midjanuary the legislatures commission on 
special investigations also is investigating the losses

honeywell bull inc announced thursday it is 
cutting 1600 jobs in the united states a reduction analysts said 
reflects weakening demand for the companys large mainframe 
computers 
the cuts will reduce the companys workforce about 6 percent and 
will include manufacturing and administration jobs at several plants 
in massachusetts and in phoenix ariz honeywell bull said 
the company said it hopes to achieve the cuts through early 
retirements and attrition in addition to layoffs it said 900 
employees are eligible for early retirement at the billericabased 
company 
honeywell bull will have a worldwide workforce of 18100 after 
the cuts 
analysts said the cuts reflect a decline in the mainframe 
computer market geared toward sophisticated scientific applications 
used principally in defense and aerospace industries 
its a recognition of whats going on said jeremy 
tennenbaum an analyst with salomon brothers inc in new york 
when all is said and done the market for scientific computers 
outside the defense department and big aerospace companies has yet 
to take off 
the weakness of federal demand for large systems means its 
going to be tough sledding for everyone in the industry especially 
if youre a new entrant he said 
honeywell bull said the reductions are not linked to an ongoing 
ownership restructuring of the company which was formed in march 
1987 as a joint venture of frances groupe bull honeywell inc of 
minneapolis and nec corp of japan 
groupe bull last week acquired 226 percent of the company from 
honeywell giving it a 651 percent ownership honeywell owns 199 
percent and nec 15 percent 
honeywell bull president roland pampel said the layoffs 
scheduled to be completed by midmarch were taken to try to improve 
the companys competitive position by cutting costs and improving 
productivity 
pampel who took over honeywell bull last july said the change 
marks a continuing consolidation were streamlining it reacting 
to things we must do from a productivity point of view he said in 
an interview 
pampel denied that the change indicated a slump in the mainframe 
market and said a new line of computers introduced in november was 
very well received by customers 
honeywell bull which moved to billerica last september has 
offices in the united states italy the great britain canada 
australia mexico and asia it reported 1987 profits of 174 
million less than 1 percent of revenues of 206 billion 
honeywell allied with groupe bull and nec to take advantage of 
the similar computer designs of all three companies in the 1960s 
when japan and europe were minor forces in the computer industry 
honeywell had licensed designs to the two companies 
the three parent companies remain independent apart from 
honeywell bull which is completing a restructuring expected to 
include a name change

a multimillionaire is 2 million poorer but 
hes convinced american consumers are richer as the result of his 
oneman quest to rid food of highly saturated tropical oils he calls 
poison 
its a story of the little guy against the giant and the giant 
is backing down said omaha businessman phil sokolof who spends 
almost all his time on his anticholesterol campaign 
the 66yearold sokolof poured 2 million into nationwide 
newspaper advertising in an effort to persuade the public to stop 
buying foods high in saturated fat because of tropical oils chiefly 
coconut oil and palm oil 
saturated fats increase blood cholesterol levels which can lead 
to heart attacks 
sokolof has claimed victory over four major food processors 
kelloggs sunshine biscuits pepperidge farm and keebler 
keebler became the latest corporate trophy head in sokolofs 
health crusade when its president announced wednesday that all 
tropical oil lard and beef fat would be removed from keebler 
products 
i think its great for the american public that thousands of 
lives will be extended because there are now four major companies 
that are reformulating literally hundreds of products to eliminate 
tropical oils he said 
sokolof who blames high cholesterol for a nearfatal heart 
attack he suffered 22 years ago said he is honored to be referred 
to by health news writers as americas no 1 cholesterol fighter 
i think i got that title because it is vacant there is no 
ralph nader of the cholesterol world he said 
his ad campaign targets foods that are high in saturated fats 
yet portrayed as healthful through such label claims as no 
cholesterol lowsalt nondairy and made with 100 
percent vegetable shortening 
you can say it has no cholesterol but if you eat palm oil and 
coconut oil they turn into cholesterol inside your body sokolof 
said 
amost everyone has known that fatty meats and most dairy 
products are high in cholesterol and saturated fat but they didnt 
know about coconut oil and palm oil hopefully they do now 
keebler president thomas garvin told the washington post that the 
change in his companys food formulas had no connection with 
sokolofs campaign he accused sokolof of sensationalizing the issue 
brian dobson a spokesman for sunshine biscuits made similar 
comments when he announced last month that sunshine would eliminate 
palm oil and palm kernel from its cookie and cracker products 
sokolof however said he was confident his fullpage ads warning 
of the poisoning of america helped put public pressure on the 
corporations to respond to consumers concerns 
its pretty coincidental that four of the majors did that 
within two months of my first ad isnt it he asked his favorite 
example is kelloggs and its cracklin oat bran cereal 
to start with they kelloggs corporate officers said i was 
irresponsible they said i was practicing quackery then two weeks 
later they called and asked to take them out of the ads because they 
were going to take tropical oils out of the cereal he said 
sokolofs biggest singleday expenditure was 140000 to place 
fullpage ads in the wall street journal and usa today 
he also advertised in the new york times and new york post but 
some newspapers including the washington post objected to the term 
poison and refused to run the ads 
his initial advertising blitz in november singled out kelloggs 
cracklin oat bran sunshines hydrox cookies pepperidge farms 
goldfish crackers keeblers club crackers nabiscos triscuit 
crackers procter amp gambles crisco shortening and three nondairy 
coffee creamers coffee swirl from kraft carnations coffeemate 
and bordens creamora 
there is still a long way to go nabisco has 50 products with 
coconut or palm oil sokolof said 
sokolof declined to discuss his wealth except to confirm he is a 
multimillionaire and say that the 2 million expenditure has not 
placed much of a dent in his net worth 
the energetic widower describes himself as a workaholic 
he made his fortune in his fathers omahabased construction 
business phillips manufacturing co he founded the national heart 
savers association in 1985 supporting it largely through his own 
contributions 
his name became synonymous with the fight against fatty foods 
after he offered free cholesterol tests on capitol hill his 
promotional packets include endorsement letters signed by dozens of 
congressmen and senators 
people who get involved with our campaign actually feel like 
they have been misled and deceived by the food giants he said 
they can go to their food pantry and find three or four of 
these products and throw them away you and i cant control 
world peace but we can control what we eat

ford motor co proudly boasts about receiving 
motor trends car of the year award for its new thunderbird sc but 
dont fall in love with the car just yet only a few hundred of 
them are available 
the rest are delayed while ford replaces defective crankshafts 
television advertisements touting ford as the winner of the 
motor trend award in three of the last four years carry a 
disclaimer that the cars are available only in limited quantities 
its kind of ironic said christopher merriman a ford dealer 
in flat rock mich but ford is sticking to its original plan not 
to bring the car out until its ready 
large supplies of the thunderbird super coupe wont be available 
until march ford division general manager thomas wagner said 
thursday 
theres very few on the road today but they are for sale out 
there he said 
max jurosek the companys vice president for car product 
development said during testing last august and september it was 
decided that a forged iron crankshaft instead of a cast iron one 
should be used in the thunderbird sc and the mercury cougar xr7 
both of which are made at fords plant in lorain ohio 
the variability of the cast process meant we were getting a lot 
of scrap wagner said we wouldnt use them all 
crankshafts change the upanddown motion of pistons into rotary 
motion that goes to wheels forged crankshafts which are stamped 
into shape are stronger and more expensive than cast crankshafts 
shaped by pouring molten metal into molds 
crankshaft castings were produced by ford at a factory in canada 
the forged crankshafts are being made by sumitomo metal co in japan 
sumitomo began shipping the forged crankshafts to ford this month 
and will deliver at least 50000 a year said kiyoshi imanishi 
sales and marketing manager for the japanese company 
ford spokesman bert serre said 390 xr7s and super coupes were 
built before the end of last year and most were distributed inside 
the company wagner said the cars with cast crankshafts pose no 
safety problem 
ford officials said dealers have ordered about 25000 super 
coupes and 3000 xr7s 
jack nerad executive editor of motor trend said the magazine 
wasnt aware of the crankshaft problem when it gave thunderbird the 
award but it would have made no difference because our car of the 
year test is not a durability test

the dollar rose sharply for a third straight day 
friday as traders interpreted comments by a west german official as 
being bullish for the us currency 
gold prices fell in new york trading republic national bank 
quoted a bid of 40625 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 pm est 
down from 40825 late thursday gold also declined on overseas 
markets 
the dollar surged after helmut schlesinger vice president of the 
bundesbank said the west german central bank had not intervened 
recently to influence exchange rates 
dealers said schlesingers remarks were taken to mean the central 
bank did not intend to defend certain exchange levels which would 
allow the dollar to gain against the west german mark 
however the bundesbank and the federal reserve did enter the 
market friday to stem the dollars rise against the mark said dan 
holland an assistant vice president at discount corp but the 
dollar still put in a strong performance 
on thursday schlesinger said the bundesbank would maintain a 
slightly restrictive monetary policy to thwart inflationary 
pressures in the west german economy those comments had a different 
effect on the dollar putting a slight damper on its rally that day 
holland said the labor departments announcement friday that 
civilian unemployment in december dropped from 54 percent to 53 
percent had no effect on the dollar 
however foreign currency dealers said the dollar gained on the 
news because it indicated strength in the us economy and raised 
the possibility of higher us interest rates 
friday was the third consecutive day of strong gains for the 
dollar it began its advance wednesday following news that us jet 
fighters had shot down two libyan war planes over the mediterranean 
sea 
the british pound lost more than 45 cents against the dollar in 
three trading sessions in london where one pound cost 17797 late 
friday cheaper for buyers than late thursdays 17970 sterling 
also declined in new york slipping to 17780 from late thursdays 
17940

late prices included 18170 west german marks up from 17985 
154825 swiss francs up from 15380 61985 french francs up from 
61415 133100 italian lire up from 131850 and 119725 
canadian dollars up from 19025 
other late rates in europe compared with thursdays late rates

dutch guilders up from 20220 133050 italian lire up from 
131625 11912 canadian dollars up from 11877 
earlier in tokyo the dollar closed at 12597 japanese yen up 
from thursdays late 12450 in london late friday the dollar traded 
higher at 12640 yen and in new york it rose to 126725 yen from 
late thursdays 125975 
although gold prices fell the metal remained resilient traders 
said and was helped by increasing demand from middle east buyers 
worried about the uslibyan situation 
gold closed in london the major market at a bid 40575 a troy 
ounce down from 40775 on thursday the closing price in zurich 
switzerland was 40550 bid down from 40720 
earlier in hong kong gold closed at a bid 41044 down from 
41094 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold fell to 40630 a 
troy ounce from 40790 late thursday 
silver bullion traded late in london at a bid 597 a troy ounce 
unchanged from thursday and the metals lowest level since march 
1987 however silver edged higher on the comex in new york closing 
at 5988 a troy ounce in comparison to thursdays 5965

general motors corp chairman roger smith said 
friday his concern about the health of the us automobile industry 
in 1989 particularly the second half is growing 
im more concerned now than i was a year ago smith said 
before speaking to a luncheon meeting of the economic club of 
detroit a year ago we were predicting a good market and i felt 
confident about it 
i feel pretty good now about the first and second quarters 
he added im very concerned about the third and the fourth 
quarter because weve got a new administration down there and i 
hope that they solve that deficit problem 
its a more acute problem now its been festering for a year 
the 1988 calendar and model years were among the best in 
automobile history with more than 15 million cars and light trucks 
sold analysts and officials for gm ford motor co and chrysler 
corp have predicted a slower sales year in 1989 
on other matters smith 
said gm was negotiating with officials of the soviet union about 
vehicle and component production in russia but he said no agreement 
was close 
i would hope all of us gm ford and chrysler could sign an 
agreement with the soviet union he said 
welcomed nissan motor corps and toyota motor corps new 
luxury car lines being prepared for the us market 
i dont see that this is competition any different than 
before smith said if i had one wish it would be that they 
built the cars in the united states 
said quality and technology has improved in the us auto 
industry so much lately that if the japanese market were to really 
open up to us wed have an excellent competitive opportunity 
there 
denied a report in fridays wall street journal that an 
agreement had been reached with toyota to produce pickup trucks at 
the gmtoyota plant in california we are negotiating with them 
but we have not reached an agreement he said 
but when asked if an agreement to make such a vehicle at the new 
united motor manufacturing plant in fremont calif was close 
smith said flatly yes 
called on the government to let industry take the lead in 
environmental and safety issues smith suggested economic incentives 
for companies to spur efforts to clean up the environment and 
provide a safe workplace 
certainly in a free society you want to control people as 
little as possible he said in our own society that means 
leaving most economic decisions to the marketplace

at 1478 a pound

cardillo an analyst with the brokerage firm josephthal amp co in new 
york 
new yorkbased analyst james steel of refco inc a large 
commodities brokerage company said the copper market was pressured 
by arbitrage selling linked to the dollars strength against the 
pound 
copper futures are traded in dollars on the commodity exchange 
and in pounds on the london metal exchange when the shifting 
exchange rate makes the dollar worth more in pounds as happened 
friday largescale players can profit by simultaneously selling 
copper on the commodity exchange and buying the same amount of 
copper in london 
they actually end up with a flat position on the copper 
market but they make money on the currency exchange steel said 
analysts said the dollar was boosted by rising us interest 
rates continuing tension in the mediterranean and by the labor 
departments announcement that civilian unemployment in december 
dropped from 54 percent to 53 percent 
the dollars gain drew a negative reaction in the gold market but 
silver futures advanced on perceptions that recent declines were 
unwarranted analysts said

ounce silver was 23 cents to 27 cents higher with march at 6075 
a troy ounce

amp cocoa exchange on speculative selling tied to bearish technical

15772 a pound 
cotton futures surged in the final 20 minutes of trading on the

usda estimated the nations hogandpig herd at 553 million head as

partners of arthur andersen amp co one of the best 
known big eight accounting companies voted to restructure the 
organization and choose a new chief executive officer the company 
announced friday 
the overhaul is intended to update the 75yearold firm and 
better meet its clients changing needs said duane r kullberg 
managing partner and chief executive officer 
kullberg 56 is stepping down after nine years at the head of 
arthur andersen but will remain a partner 
i think the decision to choose a new ceo comes from the fact 
that we have a new beginning kullberg said i think the system 
needs a new start its time to pass it on to somebody else 
the first step in the transition will be nominating a new board 
of 24 partners and choosing a new chief executive company officials 
said 
the 2200 arthur andersen partners approved the restructuring at 
their annual meeting here the move divides the company into two 
branches audittax practice and management consulting practice 
what weve done i think is to create a new global partnership 
model for the 21st century and we think weve come there first and 
i would reasonably expect others would copy kullberg said 
with 231 offices in 49 countries arthur andersen provides 
accounting audit tax management information consulting and 
professional education services the company recorded 28 billion 
in fiscal 1988 revenues 
the restructuring will allow arthur andersen to more easily bring 
experts from anywhere in the world to work on a given account as 
opposed to the current more localized operation kullberg said 
our clients operate globally and they need to be supported 
globally he said 
company officials said the restructuring plan was devised over 
the past three months by a special task force of partners it was 
reviewed by the executive committee and board of partners in a 
series of regional partners meetings last december 
under the plan the audittax and managementconsulting practices 
each will be headed by its own managing partner and will be 
responsible for much of its own staff support the change gives 
individual partners more managerial discretion close to where the 
client is served kullberg said 
each practice will be divided in three operating areas the 
americas europe middle east and africa and the asiapacific 
region 
all the operations will be linked as a network under the 
administration umbrella of arthur andersen amp co societe 
cooperative which will be headed by a single chief executive 
officer 
our practices in europe and in asia have already proven the 
effectiveness of this method of operation kullberg said by 
adopting a structure that will further facilitate individual 
initiative on a worldwide basis clients everywhere will gain the 
benefits 
kullberg said some of arthur andersens 44000 employees may be 
relocated under the restructuring primarily managers

unemployment dipped to 53 percent in december 
the government said friday matching a 14year low as president 
reagans eight years in office neared an end 
the jobless rate averaged 55 percent for all of last year down 
from 62 percent in 1987 
the labor department said decembers civilian unemployment rate 
was down 01 percentage point from november hitting 53 percent for 
the third time in 1988 the lowest level since the 51 percent of 
may 1974 
serviceproducing industries led in the creation of 279000 new 
jobs last month bringing to nearly 38 million the number of jobs 
created during the year the most since 1984s total of 395 
million the department said 
the report had little impact on wall street where traders had 
predicted the numbers and the stock market posted a modest gain 
the unemployment figures did nothing to relieve expectations that 
the federal reserve might tighten credit further in its campaign to 
keep inflation from reviving 
it shows that the economy has not shifted to a lower gear 
said economist roger brimmer of data resources inc a lexington 
mass forecasting service with the economy continuing to operate 
at these levels and continuing to grow as rapidly as it is 
inflation is going to keep creeping up 
average hourly earnings however remained unchanged for the 
third consecutive month at 945 this statistic is closely watched 
for signs of inflation but wage growth from december 1987 to 
december 1988 was just 34 percent behind the inflation rate of 44 
percent 
the economy continues to grow robustly and wage rates are not 
accelerating very much right now said washingtonbased economist 
michael k evans but i still think there is higher inflation 
ahead perhaps in spite of this report and not because of it we 
could get a big jolt in inflation in january 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the figures indicate that the longest peacetime expansion 
continued through its 73rd month the economy is on a strong 
footing and proceeding moderately and smoothly 
presidentelect bush who takes over for reagan in two weeks 
used the occasion to repeat his notax pledge 
asked whether the government could do anything to bring 
unemployment down further bush was not specific but said theres 
a lot of things where we can help in an effort to move unemployment 
lower but one way to not do that is to slow the economy down by 
going out there and raising taxes 
when reagan took office in january 1981 unemployment was 75 
percent it rose to 108 percent late in the 198182 recession the 
highest level in four decades before beginning to decline 
janet norwood commissioner of labor statistics said 3 million 
of the new jobs last year were on the service side of the economy 
including 700000 in retail trade more than 400000 were in 
manufacturing and 300000 in construction 
rebounding exports helped in manufacturing particularly the 
machinery industry factory workers continued to average four hours 
of overtime a week in december 
of the 279000 new jobs in december 107000 were in the business 
and health services industries retail trade added 52000 new jobs 
for the month most of them in department stores during the 
christmas season 
manufacturers reported adding 34000 people to their payrolls in 
december well behind the 85000 monthly gain they averaged in 
october and november 
the department said the number of jobless people fell by 9000 to 
6554000 last month it reported there were 950000 discouraged 
workers people who want jobs but are not included in the 
unemployment rate because they have given up looking for work in the 
belief that none is available that figure has been constant since 
early 1987 
the number of workers employed parttime because they cannot find 
fulltime work also was unchanged over the past year remaining at 
53 million 
an alternate jobless rate that includes in the labor force the 
17 million members of the armed forces stationed in the united 
states was also 53 percent last month unchanged from november 
the unemployment rate among adult men and adult women remained 
unchanged at 44 percent in december joblessness among teenagers 
rose from 141 percent in november to 148 percent 
the labor department said unemployment rates among other 
demographic groups were 
blacks 116 percent up from 112 in november 
black teenagers 293 percent down from 299 
hispanics 76 percent down from 8 percent 
whites 46 percent unchanged

a broker described by us prosecutors as the 
lead witness in a broad new antifraud campaign pleaded guilty 
friday to conspiracy stemming from the manipulation of four stocks 
before and during the 1987 market crash 
the guilty plea by stanley a aslanian in manhattan federal court 
came as the national association of securities dealers in washington 
said it had suspended and fined him and a colleague for manipulating 
the four stocks and quoting phony prices in the securities of at 
least three other companies 
the nasd the selfregulatory agency that runs the 
overthecounter market called the punishment a major disciplinary 
action that reflected a heightened crackdown on fraud and closer 
cooperation with law enforcement authorities 
manhattan us attorney rudolph w giuliani who has been leading 
a criminal investigation of wall street corruption for more than two 
years said thursday in disclosing the aslanian case that it was 
first result of probes into market irregularities brought to light 
by the oct 19 1987 crash 
the prosecutor praised aslanian for agreeing to cooperate in 
implicating others and said we hope this will deter people from 
similar activity and encourage others to plead guilty to help clean 
up these problems 
several firms and individuals were said to be under investigation 
but giuliani would not identify them 
aslanian 29 is the former president of the nowdefunct haas 
securities corp which folded shortly after the crash it is now in 
liquidation proceedings under federal bankruptcy law 
he was released without bail after pleading guilty before us 
district judge shirley wohl kram who set a tentative sentencing 
date of march 29 he faces a maximum punishment of five years 
imprisonment and a 250000 fine 
assistant prosecutor peter lieb said the sentencing date might be 
postponed because aslanian may be required to testify a common 
pleabargain arrangement for cooperating witnesses 
aslanians attorney kalman v gallop told reporters hes 
been cooperating and will continue to cooperate we hope his age and 
naivete getting involved with a lot of highpressure people will 
have some ameliorating effect 
his guilty plea stems from four overthecounter stocks 
manipulated by haas securities in what the government called a 
fraudulent scheme to keep the prices artificially high and dupe 
investors into purchasing them 
the scheme unraveled after the stock crash when aslanian and 
unidentified coconspirators could no longer inflate the prices of 
the stocks which included flores de new mexico ts industries big 
o tires and cliff engle 
at least part of the evidence used in the criminal case came from 
the nasd which said in a separate announcement friday that it had 
suspended aslanian for five years and fined him 100000 
in addition the nasd said eugene k laff former hass chairman 
had been suspended for two years and fined 15000 
this is the kind of case we are serious about pursuing 
daniel m sibears associate director of the nasd antifraud section 
said in a telephone interview its an area where we know there 
has got to be more focus 
an nasd statement on the violations said that besides the 
manipulation outlined in the criminal case it had found aslanian 
and leff responsible for bogus price quotes in overthecounter 
securities of fountain power boat industries satellite auction and 
eagle entertainment 
john pinto executive director of the nasd compliance department 
said in a telephone interview that the quick disposition of the 
aslanian case reflected a broadening level of cooperation between 
law enforcers and the selfregulatory organizations that scrutinize 
the financial markets 
its come together over the past year he said all the 
agencies have gotten to know each others people and departments and 
capabilities

bond prices rose friday pushed up by a stronger 
dollar and a government report showing the nations employment is in 
line with expectations 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond gained 2132 point 
or about 650 for every 1000 in face value its yield which 
moves in the opposite direction from its price fell to 903 percent 
from 908 percent on thursday 
the labor department reported friday that the civilian 
unemployment rate fell to 53 percent in december tying a 14year 
low from 54 percent in november during the final month of 1988 
279000 new jobs were created 
analysts said the job growth was no stronger than expected and 
tended to ease concerns that the economy might be overheating 
investors also focused on figures showing that average wages 
remained flat at an average of 945 an hour 
that gives some support to the notion that we have a strong 
economy but it hasnt set off a new inflationary spiral yet said 
carol stone an economist with nomura securities 
bond prices also got a boost from the rising dollar foreign 
exchange dealers attributed some of the currencys strength to the 
employment report because it indicated strength in the us economy 
and raised the possibility of higher us interest rates 
market observers had said before the jobs report was released 
that bond investors feared a substantial increase in nonfarm jobs 
would set off a new round of inflation which erodes the value of 
fixedincome securities such as notes and bonds 
inflationary pressures in turn could prompt the federal reserve 
to tighten credit by boosting interest rates 
but marshall b front an economist at the chicago investment and 
mutualfund management firm of stein roe amp farnham said that while 
a number of factors point to a stronger economy a number of other 
indicators suggest the economy is slowing down 
while interest rates including the prime lending rate could 
increase slightly over the next few weeks shortterm rates are in 
the process of cresting and we will see them begin to fall as more 
signs of an economic slowdown begin to show front predicted 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
and intermediate government issues rose 132 point intermediate 
maturities were 116 point to 516 point higher and longterm issues 
gained between 732 point and point accordig to the financial 
information service telerate inc 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 222 to 112832 
corporate issues also were higher moodys investment grade 
corporate bond index which measures price movements on 80 corporate 
bonds with maturities of five years or longer advanced 093 to

the bond buyers municipal bond index of 40 longterm bonds was

a judge friday upheld a controversial 
polaroid corp employee stock ownership plan effectively blocking a 
hostile 26 billion takeover bid by disney familyowned shamrock 
holdings inc 
the ruling by vice chancellor carolyn berger of delaware chancery 
court comes more than two months after the companies squared off in 
court over the validity of the stock plan which was unveiled just 
before shamrocks bid for the instant camera pioneer 
looks like they won said william relyea a polaroid analyst 
with eberstadt fleming inc in new york it just raises the odds 
even higher that polaroid is safe in the hands of management 
shamrock based in burbank calif maintained that polaroid 
enacted the 10millionshare 300million stock plan specifically 
to block the takeover polaroid said it was a longplanned effort to 
benefit employees 
in a 53page ruling berger said the employee stock ownership 
plan or esop was partly defensive in nature but not unfair to 
shareholders or workers and should not be invalidated 
it is structurally fair in its voting and tendering provisions 
and i do not find either the timing of its implementation or its 
possible antitakeover effect objectionable under the facts of this 
case berger wrote 
this is a defensive device assuming it is one that is 
designed to and appears likely to add value to the company and all 
of its stockholders she added it does not prevent stockholders 
from receiving or considering alternatives 
shamrock spokesman john grimaldi said the company would not 
comment until reading the decision 
the decision all but blocks a takeover because it puts 14 percent 
of polaroid stock in the hands of employees under delaware takeover 
law a hostile bidder must acquire more than 85 percent of a 
targets outstanding shares for control polaroid is incorporated in 
delaware 
polaroid which was founded by edwin h land in 1938 and 
introduced instant snapshots 10 years later also faces the 
favorable prospect of a trial in federal court in boston to 
determine how much it will receive of a 57 billion damages request 
against eastman kodak co for patent infringements 
polaroid closed friday at 3825 up 50 cents in composite new 
york stock exchange trading 
shamrock on july 19 made a friendly but unsolicited 40ashare 
bid for polaroid it later made a hostile 42ashare offer valuing 
the company at 26 billion that polaroid has urged its shareholders 
to reject the takeover hinged on the outcome of the trial 
polaroid president i macallister booth said in a statement we 
are of course delighted with this result as it supports what we 
regard as a key component of polaroids future 
shamrock a television and radio concern wholly owned by the 
family of roy e disney the animators nephew had said it would 
purchase polaroid shares under the 42 offer if the stock plan was 
invalidated 
the company which already owns about 5 million shares of 
polaroid now is faced with acquiring a controlling interest under 
the 40 offer a proposition analysts said was almost impossible 
shamrock can appeal the ruling to delaware supreme court polaroid 
has about 716 million shares outstanding 
even if shamrock threatens to acquire close to the 85 percent 
polaroid could turn to a white squire who could buy 2 percent or 
3 percent and secure the companys defense analysts said 
unless they can find some hole in the way the judge has ruled 
it seems the the odds favor polaroid on appeal said eugene glazer 
of dean witter reynolds inc without the reversal of that esop it 
becomes very difficult for shamrock to acquire polaroid under 
delaware law 
both the timing and intent of the employee stock plan were at 
issue in the delaware trial in october polaroid announced the plan 
in july just one day before a scheduled meeting with shamrock 
polaroid said its board of directors envisioned a 5 percent esop 
in march before increasing it to 14 percent at its july meeting the 
company said the plan was undertaken to increase worker motivation 
and that polaroid had talked about an employee stock plan as long as 
15 years ago 
ms berger said the timing changes in the allocation of the 
shares and other actions all had to have been motivated at least 
in part by a desire to add one more obstacle to shamrocks 
potential acquisition bid 
but she said the plan would not harm workers productivity 
polaroids employees a majority of whom signed a petition 
opposing shamrocks bid are paying for the esop shares with a 5 
percent pay cut polaroid had to borrow 285 million to fund the 
plan 
the decision and the upcoming kodak trial scheduled to begin jan 
17 in us district court mark a turnaround for polaroid which has 
struggled in the last decade as the popularity of instant 
photography has declined 
the company late last year completed a reduction of 1700 jobs in 
a major corporate restructuring polaroid now employs 8300 people 
in the united states 
for the first nine months of 1988 polaroid reported losses of 
151 million on sales of 133 billion compared to earnings of 
763 million or 123 a share on sales of 125 billion in the 
same 1987 period

intense negotiations between troubled eastern 
airlines and its largest union in a contract dispute for more than 
a year began friday under the direction of the chairman of the 
national mediation board 
management negotiators headed by tom matthews senior vice 
president for human resources and machinists negotiators led by 
district 100 president charles e bryan began meeting friday morning 
behind closed doors at a key largo fla resort no deadline has 
been set a source speaking on condition of anonymity said hotel 
rooms have been reserved for two weeks 
little progress was made in the first day of talks sources said 
chairman walter wallace of the national mediation board flew here 
thursday from washington to oversee the talks which will continue 
daily late into the night unless wallace and mediator harry 
bickford decide the two sides are making no progress 
a federal declaration of an impasse would trigger a 30day 
coolingoff period after which the 8500member union could strike 
and management would impose its own work conditions 
the principals promised to work for a settlement in the current 
talks 
mediators are always optimistic but we have a ways to go 
said bickford whos directed the mediation since jan 26 mediation 
began then after the two sides negotiations stalled 
wallaces presence adds to the pressure on the negotiators to 
settle such a highlevel entry into the mediation usually wouldnt 
come until the 30day coolingoff period 
hes here to add his expertise to the effort bickford told 
the miami herald 
as always we want to avoid a work disruption bryan said 
earlier 
eastern spokesman robin matell said management wants a 
settlement although eastern executives have been lobbying for 
months for declaration of an impasse they say setting a 30day 
deadline will get the talks moving 
the two sides have been 200 million apart since july the 
machinists last offer called for a 50 million raise the company 
asked 150 million in wage concessions mainly from the 
nonmechanics such as baggage handlers and janitors who make up 
about half the machinists union 
union leaders have suggested eastern wants a strike so it can try 
to break the union but eastern officials say they want to end 
public perceptions that the airline is beset by labor strife and get 
on with costcutting needed to reduce losses that totaled 2337 
million for the first three quarters of 1988

president reagan on friday enthusiastically 
endorsed a proposed 50 percent pay raise for members of congress and 
other top federal officials saying the door to service in the 
nations government must be open to americans regardless of their 
financial status 
reagan tossed the politically sensitive pay plan to congress 
after writing lawmakers that government jobs should not be the 
province only of the wealthy he also urged lawmakers to abolish 
the muchcriticized honoraria system that permits them to earn 
appearance fees from specialinterest groups 
the pay increase will become law automatically unless each house 
of congress rejects it by feb 8 30 days from reagans formal 
budget submission on monday 
house speaker jim wright dtexas who normally sets the 
chambers agenda said friday that he would neither encourage nor 
prevent a vote on the pay issue 
he added that if the pay raise takes effect there will be a 
ban on speaking fees and certain other forms of outside income the 
exact provisions for the severe tightening of outside earning 
limitations are being drafted in bipartisan consultations 
in the senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine has 
promised a vote 
in maneuvering two years ago congress allowed a 156 percent pay 
raise to take effect that time the senate voted 886 to reject the 
increase the house permitted enactment then took a meaningless 
voice vote against the increase 
rep tom tauke riowa has said he thinks wright is committed 
to making sure there is no vote tauke has proposed legislation 
requiring congress to vote on any pay raise while delaying 
enactment until the next congress 
sen gordon j humphrey rnh called the pay raise 
preposterous and said he had asked senate leaders to schedule an 
early vote on a resolution of disapproval 
the founding fathers meant for members to vote affirmatively 
for pay raises as a means of ensuring accountability humphrey 
said instead we have a system which violates the spirit of the 
constitution if not the letter by severing all accountability 
reagan chose not to modify a presidential commissions 
recommendation that members of congress and federal district judges 
who now make 89500 a year be paid 135000 
the speakers annual salary would go from 115000 to 175000 
and that of majority and minority leaders from 99500 to 155000 
top executivebranch officials such as cabinet members would get 
raises from their current 99500 a year to 155000 
reagans proposal would raise a presidents annual pay to about 
350000 from the current 200000 where it has stood since 1969 
however such a hike would not take effect until 1993 because of a 
constitutional prohibition on raising a presidents pay during his 
term 
presidentelect bush said friday he supported reagans decision 
but may take another look at the issue when he becomes president 
asked by reporters if the nation could afford the big pay 
increase at a time when it is grappling with huge budget deficits 
bush said well i dont know whether we can afford anything than 
to get this deficit under control 
reagan wrote congress we must ensure that the door to service 
remains open to americans who must work to support their families 
educate their children and save for their retirement 
addressing honoraria reagan said the fee system undermines 
public faith in the integrity of senior federal officials 
particularly in the legislative branch congress should move 
immediately to enact legislation that takes a comprehensive approach 
to the problems posed by honoraria including payments for articles 
speeches and appearances and other forms of financial benefits 
under the system senators can pocket up to 40 percent of their 
salaries in honoraria 35800 for the rankandfile members 
while house members can hold on to 30 percent or 26850 for the 
rankandfile fees over that amount go to charity 
rep vic fazio dcalif chairman of the house appropriations 
legislative subcommittee said he was pleased with reagans decision 
this is a pay raise for all the toplevel federal officials 
but of course we congress take all the heat he said 
fazio said he believes the senate is likely to reject the raise 
as it has in past years when the house allowed pay hikes to take 
effect 
on thursday the nonpartisan national taxpayers union delivered 
petitions to the white house saying they bear the names of 13000 
people who oppose the raise 
the groups executive vice president david keating said 
congress is hoping to batten down the hatches and weather a 30day 
storm of opposition 
the public is not going to give up after 30 days they will 
just get more angry at congressional doubledealing on the pay raise 
issue 
keating also said reagan has a personal stake in his 
recommendation because his pension would rise by 56 percent if the 
pay raise is approved he said the pension is tied to cabinet 
salaries 
the pension increase from 99500 to 155000 annually also would 
apply to former presidents ford carter and nixon keating said 
no employee of the federal government should be able to name 
his own pension before retirement yet thats exactly what 
president reagan has done keating said adding that reagan and 
the three former presidents should refuse the increase 
a white house press spokesman bj cooper said the taxpayer 
union figures were accurate but had no comment on the call for 
reagan to refuse the increase 
the president was not aware of that when he approved the pay 
raise cooper said i dont know whether it would have changed 
his decision the other factors being so overwhelming

poultry giant tyson foods inc sweetened 
a hostile takeover offer for holly farms corp to 12 billion cash 
friday a move that appeared to push it closer to acquiring the 
rival after a twomonth brawl 
it was the third time tyson has sweetened the price and came a 
week after the company won a court ruling that at least temporarily 
prevented holly from completing a friendly merger with conagra corp 
to escape tysons overtures 
in a sign holly was willing to negotiate the company said it 
would consider tysons 60ashare offer raised from 54 a share or 
11 billion holly also said it would ask if conagra wished to 
amend the merger proposal a stock swap that has been valued by 
securities analysts at about 1 billion 
holly said its board of directors would deliberate on the matter 
at a special meeting next wednesday and had urged the two potential 
acquirers to submit their best proposals before that meeting 
the developments pushed hollys stock price up 2 a share to 60 
in composite new york stock exchange trading tyson fell 37 cents a 
share to 1650 in the overthecounter market where its shares 
trade conagra was unchanged at 2975 a share on the nyse 
tyson based in springdale ark is the nations leading poultry 
company producing more than 2 billion pounds a year omahabased 
conagra turns out about 15 billion pounds and memphisbased holly 
about 12 billion pounds 
a tyson acquisition of holly would give it a major share of the 
lucrative market for poultry which is growing in popularity over 
other meat 
the latest chapter in the struggle followed a ruling last week 
from a chancery judge in delaware where holly farms is 
incorporated that the proposed hollyconagra merger wasnt in the 
best interest of holly shareholders because it didnt give them an 
opportunity to consider tysons offer 
the judge ruling in a suit brought by tysons prevented holly 
and conagra from acting on a merger agreement reached nov 17 
tyson said that other terms and conditions of the increased offer 
will be described in documents that are to be mailed shortly to 
holly farms shareholders 
tysons attempt to buy holly farms began with a friendly offer 
for about 900 million in cash and stock after holly farms rejected 
the offer tyson began pursuing a hostile takeover attempt with a 
52ashare offer that was later raised to 54 a share
