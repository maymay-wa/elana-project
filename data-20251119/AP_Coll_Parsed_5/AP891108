a leak of radioactive water at the state 
university of new york at buffalos research nuclear reactor forced 
the university to close the unit the university said tuesday 
in a news release the university characterized the leak as 
small and said there is no threat to public health or safety 
from the facility which is located on the schools south campus in 
the northernmost part of buffalo 
spokeswoman linda gracekobas said a little more than 300 gallons 
of water from the reactor tank leaked into a storage tank she said 
authorities are trying to determine how much is still leaking 
the university said the leak was discovered by the reactors 
staff sunday afternoon when a crew arrived to start it after its 
weekend shutdown 
the workers noted that the level of water in the reactor tank 
which is normally 30 feet deep had dropped three inches 
the university said the leak has been contained within the 
reactor facility and is not reaching the public water system or 
sewer system 
karl abraham a spokesman for the federal nuclear regulatory 
commission said the nrc was told that about 2 gallons an hour were 
leaking from the tank 
abraham called the leak a rare occurrence at a reasearch reactor 
but not very serious because the water is not going out of the 
facility he said the radioactivity of the water is usually 
extremely low 
louis henry general manager of the facility said the leak poses 
no danger to the reactor but that the reactor was nonetheless shut 
down to provide an additional margin of safety 
in addition to the nrc henry said the state department of health 
have been notified the reactor will remain shut down until the 
cause of the leak is identified and repaired he said 
the reactor which is managed by a private company produces 
shortlived radioisotopes for medical research and is also used to 
study the effects of radiation on materials like reactor components 
and radiation detection devices

children draw sketches of their homes so 
theyll remember them later their parents no longer repair their 
huts traders dont bother to drum up new business 
harsud is one of 573 communities destined to be flooded in a 
giant dam project that pits environmental concerns against indias 
attempts at modernization 
the government says the 15 billion project on central indias 
narmada river will irrigate droughtstricken farmland and provide 
electrical power 
critics say it will displace a million people and destroy the 
ecology 
what is the use of the dam that will be our doom said 
naginchand sand a local businessman 
in september leading environmentalists and 35000 villagers 
descended on harsud a town of 15000 in a demonstration to 
denounce the dam project as a human and environmental tragedy 
a man who runs a grocery store near sands fertilizer store said 
he had planned to expand his business but after the dam project was 
announced in 1987 all my dreams ended 
a sort of gloom descended on the village he added but now 
with the massive protest there is fresh hope 
the narmada dam project in madhya pradesh state is the largest 
ever planned in the world it envisages 30 major 135 medium and 
3000 minor dams along the 805mile river and its 41 tributaries so 
far three dams have been built 
the river is one of the holiest to hindus according ancient 
belief it was formed by the tears of shiva one of the gods of the 
hindu trinity 
the river originates in a pond 335 miles to the east of harsud 
and courses through lush forests farmland and narrow rocky gorges 
in a series of falls and twists before reaching the arabian sea on 
indias western coast 
about 21 million people 80 percent of them tribespeople and 
villagers live in the narmada basin which is bounded on three 
sides by mountains and on the fourth by the sea 
if the river is dammed 2410 square miles of forests and 
farmland an area slightly larger than delaware will be submerged 
and about 1 million people will be displaced said ashish kothari of 
kalpavriksh an independent environmental group other independent 
groups agree with those figures but no official estimates have been 
made available 
harsud will disappear under 50 feet of water when one of the 
major dams of the project the indira sagar is built 15 miles away 
the government says the dams are necessary to bring an era of 
prosperity to the valley because they will irrigate 20000 square 
miles of land in droughtprone areas of madhya pradesh and adjoining 
gujarat state 
the project is also supposed to generate 2700 megawatts of 
electricity 
as for the people who will have to move the government says it 
has prepared extensive rehabilitation plans including monetary 
compensation 
who wants money i want my land will you feel nice if the land 
that gives you food is drowned said farmer bhure singh who 
traveled 155 miles on the roof of a crowded bus to demonstrate in 
harsud 
kothari of the environmental group said there wont be enough 
land left in the area for so many people to live on if the dams are 
built 
to compensate for forest loss the government plans to plant new 
forests kothari maintained however they could not replace the 
hundreds of thousands of species of plants and animals that may have 
evolved over millions of years 
another objection is the projects 15 billion price tag which 
some economists say is a gross underestimate the world bank has 
promised to lend india 450 million for the project 
gerald fauss a senior irrigation engineer with the world bank 
said a project of narmadas size is bound to create some 
environmental disturbances 
but the tradeoff is that thousands and thousands of people 
benefit from it we still feel that the project is technically and 
economically feasible however vijay paranjpye an economist with 
the governing body of indian universities concluded in a study of 
the project that it is economically not viable

in the fashionable french trench tacky khaki is out 
and polyester is in 
the berets can stay but unpleated pants got their marching orders 
as the army paraded its new uniforms tuesday at an unusual fashion 
show 
not everyone was wild about the styles some fullfigured 
soldiers complain they may have to wear girdles to squeeze into the 
new skirtpants for women 
the parade showed blousons for all enlisted persons and straight 
pleated pants for men and women the lighter fabrics and colors with 
contemporary style and practicality make army gear look made more 
for fashion than fighting 
it was time for a change said gen gilbert forray chief of 
staff of the army who helped engineer the creation of the uniforms 
which had not changed for 40 years the uniforms were ordered from 
the house of balmain 
balmain who also recently redesigned uniforms for the french 
police was chosen after polls conducted within the army to 
determine which cuts colors and fabrics would best suit the needs 
of todays army 
the clothes were designed by balmains couture designer erik 
mortensen and patrick aubert head of the companys masculine 
fashion department 
the fashion parade after opening with some flamboyant 
redwhiteblue braidedged redingotes from the time of louis xv 
displayed what the new officers gentlemen and women will wear in 
the service beginning in 1991 
the new blousons with a shouldertowaist pleat are both sober 
and chic the clothes are topped with kepis for officers or sharp 
berets with wheelshaped pins 
and thank heaven they didnt get rid of the kepi said one 
male fashion observer who noticed that male officers would still 
sport the hat silhouette as distinctive as charles de gaulles 
khaki is out in the new military palette a lighter shade of 
putty or pewter called terre de france is in and in a lighter 
fabric a mix of wool and polyester rather than heavy twill 
its more practical a lot less gear is involved now and its 
more elegant said capt denis brunel 
except for navy blue uniforms for the infantry the army will 
wear the new greige and women will no longer wear their slate blue 
but the same putty color as men 
thats good and makes women more the equal of men said sgt 
patrick gall my wife is in the army too shell surely approve 
a layered look called modular means officers and gentlemen 
can go without their coats even when confronting superiors the 
light cotton poplin shirts underneath have epaulets tab pockets and 
may be substituted for a jacket in warm weather 
i think the uniforms look very good and easy to wear said 
col abraham vigilant of the artillery corps they give an 
impression of serenity which we need in the army im a philosopher 
with my feet on the ground 
the only sticky problem so to speak is in womens skirtpants 
a new kneelength pair of bermuda shorts with a wrapped skirt 
covering 
what about real women im waiting to see how the new uniforms 
will work out on us said sgt chantal grosjean a fullfigured 
soldier about 5foot4 a real woman has thighs and a stomach 
what happens with these uniforms we might have to wear girdles 
and she also thought they might prove difficult in summer we 
have to sit around on those fake leather chairs all day long

mao xinyu tries to lead a quiet life at a 
prestigious beijing university despite being the grandson of mao 
tsetung the revolutionary founder of communist china 
im just an ordinary student says the shy chubby sophomore 
who wears patched clothes and canvas army shoes i have 20 classes 
a week and play badminton and chinese chess with classmates 
the 19yearold history major at peoples university has seven 
roommates in a cramped firstfloor dorm room where he sleeps on a 
bottom bunk and is known simply as sixth brother 
yet on saturdays a black military limousine glides up to take 
the grandson of the great helmsman to an expensive health club 
where he enjoys the sauna 
on wednesdays when he doesnt have class the limo takes mao 
home where he has his clothes washed and an army cook prepares 
good food 
and mail pours in from people across the country nostalgic about 
chairman mao who was virtually deified as a living god by millions 
of adoring chinese during his lifetime and curious about his 
grandson 
mao xinyu is the only child of maos second son mao anqing a 
retired russian translator for the peoples liberation army and 
novelist chen raohua who wrote under the pen name shao hua 
his home where his parents and grandmother live is near the 
summer palace in northwestern beijing i cant tell you more than 
that he says with a chuckle its a state military secret 
his favorite class is the history of sinous relations and he 
spoke excitedly about the recent visit to beijing by former 
president nixon who paved the way to normalizing ties between 
washington and beijing in 1972 with his historic meeting with mao 
tsetung 
not that the elder maos place in history is entirely glorious 
western and chinese historians alike credit him with the abortive 
great leap forward of 195859 a drive to increase production 
that ultimately plunged china into widespread starvation and 
poverty he was also behind the disastrous 196676 cultural 
revolution during which intellectuals and merchants were reviled 
schools closed and red guards spouting mao slogans went on a 
nationwide revolutionary rampage 
history will judge him as a great man a leader of great 
ability who made great contributions mao xinyu says but he 
had some faults 
despite his interest in politics mao declines to discuss the 
prodemocracy protests that rocked china this spring other than to 
say of course he did not participate in the marches and 
demonstrations 
he does say however that vandals splattering of the portrait 
of mao overlooking tiananmen square on may 23 made me mad it made 
all chinese mad it was just a couple of guys trying to attract 
attention 
mao attracts plenty of attention of his own receiving bundles of 
unsolicited mail 
ordinary people students intellectuals they all write he 
says mostly theyre nostalgic about chairman mao but a lot of 
them say theyre very happy ive gone on to college 
some are girls who just want to be friends 
mao says someday hed like to visit the hometown of abraham 
lincoln and see the lincoln memorial in washington lincoln was a 
progressive capitalist revolutionary uniting the north and south in 
the civil war he said 
mao also takes some philosophy courses asked who his favorite 
philosophers are he replies marx and my grandfather

office in august met with prominent black antiapartheid activists 
and declared his willingness to confer with leaders across the 
political spectrum 
the afrikaner resistance movement has denounced de klerks 
decision to ease restrictions on antiapartheid protests and his 
pledge to extend political rights to blacks 
in july terreblanche said de klerk was not man enough to run 
against him for a parliamentary seat but de klerk had to quit 
parliament to become president and terreblanche decided not to run 
for office 
cabinet ministers plan two other meetings this week related to 
ongoing political controversies 
foreign minister pik botha is to travel thursday to the 
nominally independent black homeland of transkei to confer with its 
military leader gen bantu holomisa the 33yearold general last

congress to operate in transkei and has suggested holding a 
referendum to see if homeland residents want to renounce their 
independence which is not recognized by any foreign country 
development minister stoffel van der merwe and deputy foreign

every night in thousands of indian 
villages residents gather around a small television set in the 
dusty main bazaar for news they once only got third or fourth hand 
if at all 
suddenly people steeped in ancient tradition who seldom venture 
beyond the next village are plunged into a world of historical 
pageantry costume drama satellite sports or whatever prime 
minister rajiv gandhi happens to be doing that day 
in bandikui across the rajasthan state and even in the most 
backward of indias 550000 villages television has become the 
primary means of education and the main source of information 
only about 20 million television sets serve the countrys 880 
million people but indians already have developed a lovehate 
relationship with the governmentrun television network doordarshan 
and gandhi and the governing congress party facing a general 
election later this month are well aware of the networks enormous 
influence 
political analysts say the election is likely to be the most 
uncertain in 22 years there are no major national issues to swing 
the vote as in the past four elections and the governing party its 
popularity wavering stands a chance of losing power for the second 
time in modern indias 42year history 
it will be the first indian election in which television will 
have a major role to play said political analyst bhabani sen 
gupta in new delhi 
in a nation with 36 percent literacy the government still wields 
a powerful monopoly over the twothirds majority who depend on radio 
and televison for information 
critics contend the coverage has become so biased toward the 
prime minister that what is labeled news is merely propaganda for 
the governing party 
television is becoming a serious impediment to free and fair 
elections it tilts the balance totally in favor of the ruling 
party said opposition leader lk advani minister of 
broadcasting and information during the 197779 opposition 
government 
the government denies charges the network has become its 
propaganda tool 
gandhi is not only the president of the ruling party he is the 
prime minister of the worlds largest democracy and what he says 
and where he goes is news said hkl bhagat minister of 
broadcasting and information does the western media ignore maggie 
thatcher or george bush 
the controversy highlights just how far india has matured 
materially and politically since jawaharlal nehru gandhis 
grandfather and indias first prime minister declared television an 
expensive toy unsuitable for his poor country 
doordarshan which means seen from afar in hindi debuted in 
new delhi in 1965 with blackandwhite broadcasts the network 
expanded to other cities by 1972 adding to the countrys rapid 
progress in technology and the rising prosperity of the middle class 
color broadcasts began seven years ago 
when gandhi coasted to a landslide victory two months after his 
mothers 1984 assassinatio television reached just 18 percent of the 
population but its influence was quickly noticed by the new 
government 
to a large number of indians gandhi is the first indian prime 
minister who is also a television personality said tavleen singh 
a political commentator for the indian express newspaper which has 
been highly critical of gandhis government 
whereas mrs gandhi used television mainly for political 
purposes rallies important speeches her trips abroad rajiv has 
managed to go a step beyond and use it to project himself as a 
person as well singh said 
the doordarshan network now has 18 stations and 340 transmitters 
beaming to nearly 90 percent of indias villages and cities the 
entire country will be within reach by early next year 
critics contend the networks coverage has gone from generally 
favorable to outright bias 
the prime minister and his party have increasingly dominated the 
20minute english and hindilanguage nightly news programs the 
opposition has been given short shrift with coverage often 
highlighting inconsequential points of leaders speeches and 
frequently editing out criticism of the government critics say 
such tactics have drawn fire from the english languagepress 
which has dismissed the network as a pusillanimous propaganda 
pustule 
some reporters say the network often takes orders directly from 
the prime ministers office and there is a huge amount of 
selfcensorship 
no one wants to take a chance with the prime ministers 
coverage you never know what some hardline party member will 
object to said one senior reporter speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
government officials defend their actions 
this is the legitimate work of the information and broadcasting 
ministry said deputy minister kk tewari it is our legitimate 
duty also to rebut unjust criticism of the government

archbishop daniel pilarczyk elected as 
president of the national conference of catholic bishops says he is 
hoping to give the laity more of a role in running the church 
i think were moving out of a situation in which the only 
person who was allowed to do anything in the parish was a priest 
and i think thats a healthy move said pilarczyk archbishop of 
cincinnati 
in the archdiocese of cincinnati two of the six people in the 
bishops inner circle are women and laypeople serve as 
directors of religious education visitors of the sick and youth 
ministers 
pilarczyk 55 was ordained a priest in 1959 became auxiliary 
bishop of cincinnati in 1974 and archbishop in 1982 after cardinal 
joseph bernardin left for the archdiocese of chicago 
pilarczyk said he is not sure he could have been a bishop in the 
days before the second vatican council in the early 1960s when many 
prelates were brickandmortar men expected to be adept at 
handling finances and building new churches 
since vatican ii pilarczyk said what is expected of a bishop is 
greater grassroots contact with the laity and more pastoral 
attention to the personal needs of priests 
like his predecessor archbishop john may of st louis whom 
pilarczyk served as conference vice president pilarczyk is viewed 
as a moderate who enjoys support from both liberal and conservative 
camps 
pilarczyk will play just the role thats needed now we want a 
middleoftheroad stance said monsignor joseph gremillion a 
scholarinresidence at notre dame university 
when asked what are the most important issues facing the church 
pilarczyk mentioned abortion and euthanasia and economic issues such 
as third world debt and the rights of labor unions 
in matters of public policy pilarczyk indicated a willingness to 
compromise 
for example he said if the question was whether he would 
tolerate abortions for rape and incest victims if the law were 
changed to prohibit other abortions the answer is probably yes 
pilarczyk said he does not favor a general statement saying the 
bishops conference could tolerate condom education in public 
schools if sexual abstinence was presented as the only morally 
correct way to prevent aids 
in saying that you almost necessarily encourage people to 
engage in premarital sexual activity he said 
a document on aids approved by the conferences administrative 
board was criticized by some bishops for conditionally tolerating 
condom education and a second statement on aids that attacks condom 
education is scheduled for a vote wednesday 
if pilarczyk has a fault according to the rev thomas j reese 
of the woodstock theological center at georgetown university it may 
be that he relies too much on intellectual argument to win people to 
his side 
sometimes it takes more than that to persuade people said 
reese author of archbishop inside the power structure of the 
american catholic church his one weakness may be he may not be 
political enough 
pilarczyks term as president will run for three years

mississippi on tuesday ordered a south 
carolina company to remove a train carrying 5000 tons of sewage 
sludge or face 2 million a day in fines 
mississippi is not a dumping ground for someone elses sewage 
and this order should ensure that we get rid of it gov ray mabus 
said in a statement announcing the order by the state department of 
environmental quality 
the train dubbed the poo poo choo choo arrived friday in 
moss point just outside pascagoula on the gulf coast after being 
driven out of louisiana by residents who complained of its smell 
the 63 cars covered with plastic are loaded with 5000 tons of 
nonhazardous treated human waste from baltimore

the waste 
a hearing to allow the company to challenge the fines was 
scheduled for nov 21 said mike goff mabus adviser on 
environmental issues 
gsx vice president roger davis said tuesday night that the 
proposed fine seemed excessive 
in a telephone interview from his columbia home he said gsx was 
considering sending the sludge to one of several landfills or to one 
of several composting businesses and said he believed the company 
would find someone to take the waste wednesday he declined to 
identify the landfills 
gsx contracted with metcalf and eddy service inc of baltimore to 
dispose of 12000 tons of the sludge from baltimores municipal 
sewage system at a plant in white castle la an unspecified amount 
of waste still waits in baltimore 
davis said the contract allows his company to return the waste if 
it is turned away at white castle but the company in baltimore 
hasnt wanted to take it back 
we probably arent going to take any more of it since this has 
been such a problem he said

humorist art buchwald will call several 
prominent hollywood writers including directorscreenwriter billy 
wilder as expert witnesses in his plagiarism lawsuit against 
paramount pictures corp 
in the 5 million suit set for trial in state court next month 
buchwald contends the eddie murphy movie coming to america is 
similar to an idea called king for a day that the columnist came 
up with in 1983 
both stories involve african princes who come to the united 
states and fall in love 
the studio has denied the plagiarism allegations late last 
month los angeles superior court judge harvey schneider denied a 
motion by paramount to dismiss the lawsuit 
plagiarism lawsuits involving ideas for films are complicated 
because many people can be involved in working on a screenplay at 
various stages of production 
the 83yearold wilder a sixtime academy award winner whose 
movies include such classics as the lost weekend and the

voters rejected by a 2to1 margin tuesday a 
proposal that would have raised the salary of texas lawmakers from 
7200 a year to 23300 
its a good thing there wasnt a ballot alternative that said 
legislators pay should be lowered said democratic state sen 
chet edwards of duncanville 
with 83 percent of the states precincts reporting the pay raise 
was defeated with 614373 no votes or 65 percent to 327823 yes 
votes or 35 percent 
another proposal that would have boosted lawmakers daily expense 
allowance from 30 to 81 was defeated 53 percent to 47 percent 
opponents of the pay hike noted that lawmakers meet only 140 days 
every other year language in the amendment would strip voters of 
the ability to approve future pay raises by tying lawmakers 
salaries to the governors pay which the legislature sets 
texas voters faced 21 ballot propositions 
a 500 million bond issue that would provide money for water 
projects statewide with 100 million dedicated to cleaning up 
substandard communities on the mexican border was leading by a 58 
percent to 42 percent margin with 89 percent of the vote in 
a 400 million bond issue for building prisons and mental health 
facilities passed by 68 percent to 32 percent

the idea may sound a little flaky but ed and 
fritzi cohen and their russian partners insist they can turn a 
profit on a joint venture to make upscale organic potato chips 
in the soviet union 
what you call a potato chip is almost unknown in the soviet 
union said valeri perekhvatov one of two soviet partners who 
signed a joint venture protocol tuesday with the cohens 
we believe that potato chips are a good snack especially after 
you have had a glass of vodka he told a news conference called to 
announce the venture the kartoshka trust which translates from 
russian roughly as the spud trust 
not only will chips ease the crunch in the soviet snack market 
said perekhvatov but by frying the chips down on the farm and 
transporting the finished product the partners hope to avoid one of 
the most vexing problems of soviet agriculture the loss of up to 
half of the crop in storage and transport 
the kartoshka trust plans to start small selling about 100 tons 
of chips annually to a very different market than served by the 
cohens tabard farm potato chips 
tabard farm accounts for a tiny fraction of americas annual 4 
billion potato chip market the cohens say they grow 
environmentally sound spuds in the shenandoah valley of 
virginia truck them to aunt annies potato chip factory in 
pennsylvanias amish country and market them in a few tony stores 
restaurants and clubs in new york chicago washington and 
philadelphia 
the kartoshka trust expects to market about 95 percent of its 
spuds in regular moscow stores and about 5 percent in the beriozka 
stores and luxury hotels that cater to western visitors and accept 
only hard currency perekhvatov said 
the cohens said their low initial investment in the kartoshka 
trust will help them avoid what has been a fatal trap for some 
ussoviet ventures a soviet law that allows the foreign partner 
to take home only the profits that are made in convertible western 
currencies 
the soviet government on oct 27 devalued the ruble for a limited 
number of transactions involving foreign businesses allowing them 
to convert at 16 cents on the ruble but for most transactions the 
rate remains at the inflated official level of 159 and the ban 
remains on converting from rubles to dollars at the higher rate for 
repatriating profits 
but the cohens said they were content to run a large ruble 
surplus until they find solutions to what now seem to be 
insurmountable problems of getting the money home 
besides they believe they can obtain the right kind of potato 
chip kettle for rubles rather than dollars their only other dollar 
expense is expected to be 10000 bags for the initial market run 
plus plane tickets to moscow to sign a more formal contract in 
january he said 
the goal of the operation at least for the american side is not 
large profits but helping the soviets develop a new type of 
smallscale food industry said fritzi cohen who was a founding 
member of the washingtonmoscow citizens exchange designed to 
promote friendship between the superpowers 
america is way ahead of the soviet union in chip technology 
acknowledged perekhvatov but the kartoshka trust will try to bridge 
that gap by allowing the soviets to start with a simple manageable 
process 
the protocol signed tuesday requires perekhvatovs moscowbased 
likino cooperative and the zybina farm cooperative near the city of 
tula to minimize their use of chemicals and synthetic fertilizers 
said ed cohen 
and they will build what he called a onekettle chip factory 
employing about a dozen people to clean slice fry transport 
market and account for the potato chips he said 
because of our small scale we can help people who can handle 
this get off to a good start said ed cohen we think that it is 
a model for economic development in certain parts of the soviet 
union

the bush administration must run faster and 
plan better to meet increased competition for civil and military 
technologies from nations such as japan and korea a top pentagon 
advisory board recommends 
national security can no longer be viewed only in military 
terms but must include economic wellbeing as a key component 
this is a distinct departure from the past said the defense 
advisory board an independent group set up to counsel the pentagon 
the point is it is not japans aggressive roadmap for the 
future that is at fault rather it has been our own inability to 
get our act together and create a national vision and set of goals 
of our own the panel said 
the panel issued a strongly worded report that said the current 
policies for industrial cooperation and technology transfers are 
no longer appropriate and may endanger americans global economic 
and military wellbeing 
our economic as well as our military security depends vitally 
on technological leadership technology is the new coinage of the 
realm and ours has been seriously depleted we cannot maintain a 
lead by conservatism and protectionism we must run faster said 
malcom currie the chairman of hughes aircraft co and head of the 
task group that issued the report 
the report touched on the recent controversy over the joint 
usjapanese development of the fsx fighter plane which set off an 
acrimonious debate in congress over concerns about giveaways of us 
technology to nations eager to use american expertise to build their 
own industries 
some in congress were angry that the japanese refused to simply 
purchase the plane from the united states as a replacement for the 
f16 while others argued the deal promoted exchanges of technology 
and helped the us industries involved 
the fragmented policies of the past in which military security 
and economic issues were separated are no longer acceptable 
currie said in a letter accompanying the report we must 
acknowledge this new reality and act accordingly 
the report which dealt with the socalled pacific rim nations 
predicted their emerging economic bloc will be the most powerful by 
the end of the century it noted the us commercial trade deficit 
with those countries accounts for twothirds of the overall us 
trade deficit 
it called upon the administration to develop a coherent 
policy for longterm us cooperation with these nations in 
defense economics and technological growth to maintain them as 
military allies and achieve solid us technological and industrial 
strength over the long run 
our comparative industrial manufacturing and technological 
strength has been eroded seriously over the last decade this 
erosion must be reversed so that we can enter cooperative ventures 
involving technology transfer from a position of strength the 
panel wrote 
the panel called for a thoughtful toughminded approach and 
recommended in particular that for usjapanese relations there 
must be a mutually beneficial twoway sharing of technology 
the report noted japans government and industry have worked 
together to establish that nation as a dominant global player in 
hightech industries by the year 2000 
a coherent us policy for defense industrial cooperation is 
necessary if problems such as those that arose with the fsx are to 
be avoided in the future the panels report stated 
us policy must promote better coordination among such 
agencies as the pentagon state department cia department of 
commerce and national security council and the department of labor 
the report said 
the group said the nation lacks a policy framework to deal 
with the complex issue and among other things called for the 
formation of a highlevel interagency group to propose such a 
strategy to the president within six months

fair russian wheat aphids were a continuing problem in portions of 
the pacific northwest 
the facility is operated by the departments of agriculture and 
commerce its reports cover weather and crop conditions only not

the agriculture department says a fungus from 
australia is showing up well as a natural killer of destructive 
grasshoppers that threaten crops and rangeland 
jerry fowler director of the departments grasshopper integrated 
pest management project said preliminary laboratory experiments 
indicated the fungus entomophaga praxibuli can infect and kill a 
broad range of the pesky hoppers 
usdas animal and plant health inspection service said if the 
fungus proves out it could help lessen the need for chemicals to 
control the pests the project plan is to integrate the fungus with 
research demonstrations in north dakota next year and also begin 
experiments with it in alaska 
the fungus only affects grasshoppers the agency said 
tuesday laboratory tests using doses at least 100 times greater 
than any found in nature have repeatedly shown that the fungus 
causes no harm to other insects and does not affect humans or other 
mammals 
grasshoppers are infected by the fungus directly through their 
outer covering and usually die within 7 to 10 days laboratory tests 
have shown that once established the fungus can also spread to 
future generations of grasshoppers 
the fungus produces spores that survive the winter in the soil 
waiting to attack the next years crop of insects the agency said 
other biological control agents such as viruses and bacteria take 
longer to be effective because they must be eaten before infection 
can occur 
scientists isolated the fungus from grasshoppers during an 
outbreak in australia in 1985 
the dry conditions in the wanwibinda region of new south wales 
where this fungus was discovered were said to be similar to 
americas northwestern rangelands where outbreaks annually infest 
millions of acres of crops and livestock rangelands 
we believe that further research and controlled introduction of 
e praxibuli in our project trials will increase our options by 
providing and effective longterm biological control agency 
fowler said

durham nc and reclaiming the mayors seat in cleveland 
on the west coast norm rice was leading in his attempt to break 
the racial barrier in seattle 
these gains represent expansion for the group that was locked 
out said jesse jackson the twotime presidential candidate who 
is a possible mayoral candidate in washington dc next year 
rep bill gray dpa the house majority whip and the nations 
highest black elected figure praised dinkins election and said new 
york voters have rejected the politics of fear dinkins 
withstood late campaign attacks on his character and integrity 
democrat john daniels a veteran connecticut state senator 
easily defeated republican alderwoman robie pooley to become new 
havens first black mayor in durham chester jenkins defeated 
conservative candidate nelson strawbridge 
in detroit veteran mayor coleman young who is black won a 
fifth term by defeating black challenger tom barrow the man he 
defeated four years ago 
the offyear election put democratic blacks in control of most of 
the nations bigcity mayors offices chicago and houston are now 
the nations biggest cities with a white mayor

both of these candidates who had a fairly similar strategy in 
some ways will be viewed as role models said linda williams a

the vermont supreme court following a 
poetic premise by robert frost says good neighbors neednt help 
keep up good fences 
the five justices on tuesday found unconstitutional a 1790 law 
making a livestock owner and neighbor equally responsible for 
maintaining the fence between their properties 
the ruling came 75 years after frost vermonts and the nations 
late poet laureate published mending wall 
in the poem frost questions the springtime ritual of helping his 
neighbor fix the stone wall between their properties only to have 
the old farmer respond good fences make good neighbors 
frost wrote in part 
before i built a wall id ask to know 
what i was walling in or walling out 
and to whom i was like to give offense 
in tuesdays case offense was taken by ernest and louise 
choquette of newport when adjoining landowners robert and rose 
perrault refused to help pay for a fence built to keep the 
choquettes cows off the perraults land 
the choquettes sued the perraults for the amount the town fence 
viewer ruled the perraults owed under state law 316 
two lower courts ruled in the choquettes favor but the supreme 
court said the perraults dont have to pay 
the high courts ruling turned on the question of whether the 
public good outweighed the state constitutions ban on giving 
special breaks to special groups in this case landowners with 
livestock 
the court found it made sense in the 18th 19th and early 20th 
centuries to say the public good outweighed the nospecialinterests 
clause 
the land was predominantly open and farmed and rural 
landowners were also livestock owners justice ernest gibson iii 
wrote 
without the fence law livestock owners would be solely 
responsible for keeping their animals from damaging their neighbors 
property and solely responsible for the fence the court said 
but gibson wrote as a result of changing landuse patterns 
the law more and more often applies to landowners without livestock 
in such situations the fence law is burdensome arbitrary and 
confiscatory and therefore cannot pass constitutional muster 
many have misread frosts view of shared fencemending 
responsibility as being positive said margaret edwards an english 
professor at the university of vermont 
she pointed to a line in which frost says 
in each hand like an oldstone savage armed 
he moves in darkness it seems to me 
the old farmer is really being put down edwards said 
though its done so gracefully it almost doesnt seem that way at 
first glance 
she added robert frost in my opinion would be very pleased to 
see the courts decision to strike down the fence law 
lawyer robert bent whose argument prevailed at the high court 
said a lower court judge had cited the good fences make good 
neighbors line in his decision that the high court overturned 
the superior court judge alden bryan sort of missed the point 
that frost was making that his neighbor was holding onto hidebound 
tradition bent said he added that the legal argument paralleled 
the poetic that the vermont fence law was a narrowminded tradition 
best discarded 
the choquettes lawyer robert davis said he was disappointed to 
have lost the case but could understand the courts logic 
davis pointed to gibsons comments about shifting landuse 
patterns and to a line from another poet named robert the times 
they are a changin

congress is ready to launch an investigation of 
the eastern airlines strike but president bush who refused to 
intervene when the walkout began eight months ago may veto the bill 
calling for the review 
legislation creating a housesenate commission won final approval 
monday in the house but the administration said its position had 
not changed since last month when it issued a statement saying the 
measure was a candidate for a veto 
the bill approved on a voice vote is a watereddown version of 
organized labors initial attempt to get congress to demand that 
bush use his power to halt the strike by naming an emergency 
mediation board bush said then that the dispute should be settled 
by easterns unions and management 
instead of demanding that bush intervene the bill now headed to 
the white house would create a fourmember panel to recommend ways 
to end the eastern strike it also would make suggestions for 
maintaining competitiveness in the airline industry and for 
protecting employees of air carriers that seek bankruptcy protection 
labor urged bush to reconsider his veto threat 
we urge the president to quickly sign this bill into law 
aflcio president lane kirkland said in a statement for the 
president to do otherwise would strip the administration of any 
pretense of fairness in this dispute 
under the bill a democrat and a republican from the house and 
one each from the senate would be appointed by their respective 
leaders in congress to the commission the panels report would be 
due 45 days after enactment 
its recommendations should they include presidential 
intervention would not be binding on bush but could lead to 
additional legislation 
eastern was struck by the machinists union march 4 and most 
union pilots and flight attendants have honored the walkout the 
airline owned by texas air corp filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection five days after the strike began and although still 
cashpoor has been rebuilding as a nonunion carrier 
the unions have contended that texas air corp chairman frank 
lorenzo has siphoned eastern cash and assets for the parent 
corporation and wants to use bankruptcy to bust the unions as he 
did when texas air bought continental airlines filed for chapter 11 
and then emerged as a nonunion carrier 
texas air has said concessions by easterns union workers were 
necessary for it to remain competitive

in a spinoff from the reagan administrations 
irancontra scandal the senate is moving to set up for the first 
time an independent watchdog inside the central intelligence agency 
senators voted 6434 late tuesday to keep the independent 
inspector general provision in a bill authorizing us intelligence 
activities for the next two years 
the provision offered by sen arlen specter rpa would create 
an independent cia inspector general nominated by the president and 
confirmed by the senate the current inspector general is appointed 
by the director and reports only to him president bush is strongly 
opposed to the senate plan 
the intelligence bill later was passed on a voice vote and sent 
to a conference to work out differences between it and a version 
passed by the house last month 
the house bill would retain the current system for appointing the 
inspector general but would require full access to the 
investigators reports and audits by the intelligence committees on 
capitol hill the house approach also is opposed by the white house 
and would tempt a veto the administration has said 
in its irancontra investigation two years ago congress 
concluded the scandal escaped the notice of the cia inspector 
general because the office did not have the manpower resources or 
tenacity to uncover what had gone on 
among its recommendations was an independent investigator at the 
agency like the arrangement approved by the senate on tuesday 
the implication was that the agencys overseer had turned a blind 
eye to the activities of his boss thencia director william casey 
who was deeply involved in the scandal that sent arms to iran and 
clandestine funds to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
irancontra was a very significant event in our history and 
there are some lessons to learn from it said sen william cohen 
rmaine vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee and a 
member of the special panel that investigated the scandal 
we had the potential to have a government within a government 
selling assets and using the money to run operations with no trail 
no trace and no one would know cohen said we nearly saw the 
unraveling of a presidency 
others including sen daniel patrick moynihan dny sought to 
link the provision to a new bush administration policy that will 
free us operatives to work with the plotters of coups in countries 
like panama so long as the coup is not aimed at assassinating a 
foreign leader they argued stronger agency oversight would help 
keep such a policy from running out of control 
several senators sought to strip out the new reins on the agency 
saying the restrictions would appear to be a slap at cia director 
william webster and could hamper the agencys ability to win 
cooperation from intelligence sources and other countries 
they wouldnt be dealing just with one organization they would 
be dealing with two parallel organizations that exist side by side 
with two chains of command argued sen john danforth rmo 
under the provision the cia director would be able to shut down 
an inspector generals investigation if he felt it were dangerous to 
national security but would have to inform the congressional 
intelligence committees of his action within seven days 
the overall intelligence bill provides a blueprint for the 
governments intelligence spending over the next two years most of 
what the united states spends on such activities is secret tucked 
away in the pentagon budget but reports put the spending level at 
upwards of 25 billion a year most of it for personnel and spy 
hardware like satellites and lesser amounts for covert operations 
overseas

the nations former chief thrift regulator says 
he was asked by sen dennis deconcini to drop a rule barring risky 
investments by the nowdefunct lincoln savings and loan association 
whose owner was a major political contributor 
former federal home loan bank board chairman edwin j gray told 
the house banking committee on tuesday that deconcini dariz made 
the request to him in an april 2 1987 meeting in deconcinis 
office attended by three other senators 
the four senators who received 13 million in contributions 
arranged by phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr who 
controlled lincoln all have acknowledged they were at the meeting 
but denied knowledge of such a request 
the others present at the meeting gray testified were sens 
john mccain rariz alan cranston calif and john glenn dohio 
the other three senators gray testified raised no objection 
whatsoever when deconcini proposed that i withdraw a duly 
adopted regulation on behalf of their friend and their 
contributor 
he quoted deconcini as saying the senators would convince their 
friend to make more home loans if the regulation was withdrawn 
until after it had been tested in the courts 
it sounded like a quid pro quo gray said it was a quid 
pro quo 
the four senators plus sen donald riegle dmichigan now 
chairman of the senate banking committee also have acknowledged 
meeting a week later with regional bank board officials based in san 
francisco who had been called to washington to answer questions 
about an ongoing audit of lincoln 
all five senators have been asked by the senate ethics committee 
to explain in detail their presence at the two april 1987 meetings 
but the senate panel has begun no formal investigation 
bob maynes a spokesman for deconcini said his boss and the 
three other senators have consistently taken issue with grays 
description of the meeting 
there were five people in that room gray and the four 
senators he said and all four senators have said on the record 
that gray is totally and completely inaccurate 
but gray said a claim that he fabricated such a yarn simply 
is not credible 
the fact that this meeting became public knowledge has deeply 
embarrassed these senators he testified they have every reason 
in the world to deny what sen deconcini offered me in that meeting 
because he was evidently speaking on their behalf 
his testimony came in the fourth of a series of hearings by the 
house committee on why regulators waited two years after bank board 
examiners concluded that lincoln was acting in an unsafe and unsound 
manner before seizing control of it 
federal regulators seized lincoln last april and said they could 
have to pay up to 2 billion to depositors whose federally insured 
savings were lost through lincolns risky investments 
the resolution trust corp the agency created by congress to 
clean up the thrift industry mess filed a 11 billion suit in 
september against lincoln and keating alleging fraud and 
racketeering 
keating who has said he arranged several millions of dollars in 
contributions to members of both political parties this decade 
purchased the 29branch lincoln sampl in irvine calif in 1984 
he also had been scheduled to testify tuesday before the house 
panel but his appearance was postponed for two weeks at the request 
of his attorneys 
another witness tuesday jack atchison refused to answer any 
questions claiming a fifth amendment constitutional right against 
selfincrimination 
atchison was in charge of auditing lincoln for arthur young amp co 
in 1987 and wrote nearly identical letters to riegle mccain and 
deconcini that march supporting assertions by lincolns officials 
that it was being harassed by bank board examiners 
shortly afterward according to the house panels chairman rep 
henry b gonzalez dtex atchison resigned from arthur young and 
took a 900000ayear job with lincolns parent company american 
continental corp which is chaired by keating 
in other testimony tuesday 
former california sampl commissioner larry taggert acknowledged 
that four weeks before leaving his job at the end of 1984 he 
approved a change in state regulations that allowed lincoln to make 
900 million in direct investments that would have been forbidden by 
a new federal policy 
while still in office taggert was listed in a filing with the 
securities and exchange commission as a board member of tcs 
financial a san diego investment consulting firm that lincoln 
bankrolled in january 1985 with a 289 million purchase of stock 
former bank board member lee henkel who had more than 2 
million in loans from lincoln when named to the board in 1986 
testified that he recused himself from all decisions involving 
lincoln during his fivemonth term he denied allegations by gray 
and others that his proposal at his first board meeting to 
grandfather exclusions for direct investments prior to december 
1984 from the regulation was at lincolns behest 
i had no idea at the board what was going on at lincoln he 
said adding that he had no conversations with keating or any of 
keatings representatives before drafting it

a 10000 federal grant for an aids art show 
that includes homosexual images is being reviewed by the national 
endowment for the arts as a possible violation of a new 
antiobscenity statute 
the nea grant to artists space a private nonprofit arts 
institution in new york city is the subject of weeklong 
negotiations between arts endowment chairman john e frohnmayer and 
susan wyatt the gallerys executive director 
the issue was discussed tuesday by board members of the manhattan 
gallery but ms wyatt refused to say whether any decisions were 
made she and frohnmayer refused to discuss details of the 
negotiations but frohnmayer said he believed the matter would be 
resolved later this week 
the neas taxpaid grant was awarded to artists space last july 
before congress approved legislation inspired by sen jesse helms 
rnc that forbids federal support for artworks that may be 
considered obscene by the arts endowment chairman 
the endowment cannot force the new york gallery to return the 
10000 in taxpayer funds but frohnmayer said in a telephone 
interview the endowments options include formally disavowing its 
support for the aids show and persuading the gallery to refund the 
money voluntarily 
ms wyatt said she alerted frohnmayer to the content of the show 
because she was concerned that helms might not particularly like 
this artwork and she wanted to make the nea aware of a potential 
controversy involving one of its grants 
ms wyatt said the 30000 exhibition includes images of gay 
sexuality among the works by 23 painters sculptors and 
photographers that depict the emotional and spiritual effects of 
aids on the artistic community the show is scheduled to open at 
artists space on nov 16 
there is male nudity in the show but i dont consider that 
necessarily homoerotic ms wyatt said there is also female 
nudity but no one has said anything about that 
it was the first time frohnmayer has wrestled with the legal 
implications of the antiobscenity law regarding a specific nea 
grant recipient 
the law enacted last month expressly forbids spending tax money 
on depictions of sadomasochism homoeroticism the sexual 
exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts and 
any other works that lack serious artistic or literary value 
the congressional ban was prompted by a controversy over 45000 
worth of nea grants to contemporary art institutes in philadelphia 
and winstonsalem nc that supported works by photographer robert 
mapplethorpe and artist andres serrano 
helms and other conservative lawmakers criticized some of their 
pictures as highly offensive and sought to restrict the arts 
endowments grantmaking authority 
a touring exhibition of mapplethorpes work which was canceled 
in june by the corcoran gallery of art in washington included 
homoerotic and sadomasochistic images and pictures of nude children 
serrano was criticized for a photograph of a crucifix submerged in a 
container of urine 
the nea gave 10000 to artists space for the aids show before 
the helms legislation was approved last month as part of the 
endowments 171 million appropriation for the current fiscal year 
the endowment an independent federal agency awarded 156 
million in matching grants last year to about 800 individual artists 
and 3800 arts institutions 
frohnmayer told a weekend meeting of the national council on the 
arts a presidentially appointed body that advises the arts 
endowment the new law is extremely difficult to interpret and 
is being implemented with caution

thousands of dangerous waste dumps never make 
the superfund list or any other federal roster of toxic sites 
according to testimony at a house panel hearing 
the list is incomplete because the way epa gathers information 
and evaluates sites is seriously flawed says the office of 
technology assessment 
the general accounting office says the list is arbitrary and up 
to 425000 sites have yet to be put on any kind of federal list 
despite potential harm to the environment 
the two congressional research services presented their findings 
tuesday at a hearing of the house government operations subcommittee 
on environment energy and natural resources headed by rep mike 
synar dokla 
many sites never enter the superfund program because they fail 
to be discovered or are discovered but are not entered into the 
inventory of potential cleanup sites otas joel s hirschhorn 
told the house government operations subcommittee on environment 
energy and natural resources 
he said the epa relies on information supplied it from state and 
local governments for example rather than devising ways to seek out 
data on hazardous waste sites 
epa also is ruling out too many sites from superfund 
consideration too early in the review stage to have a firm handle on 
their potential harm hirschhorn said he said epa is sacrificing an 
objective review of superfund sites to the bureaucratic need to 
manage its caseloads 
a report released last month by hirschhorns office estimates the 
epa may have rejected as many as 2000 sites for superfund 
consideration 
the epa said it could not challenge the figures because it did 
not know how they were compiled but it defended its early screening 
process 
yes weve processed more but weve made better decisions 
replied henry longest director of epas office of emergency and 
remedial response 
the nearly 10yearold superfund program has resulted in the full 
cleanup of 38 of 1200 sites deemed to need immediate federal 
attention said richard l hembra of the gao the investigative arm 
of congress 
gao estimates that between 130000 and 425000 sites may 
eventually have to be evaluated for possible cleanup action a 
burden that will fall mostly on the states 
the house appropriations committee estimated last year that a 
superfund cleanup costs on the average 21 million to 30 million 
a gao report released at the hearing said the evaluation of sites 
for superfund depends on an arbitrary numerical rating adding that 
a number of sites coming close to that cutoff score pose real 
hazards even though they dont make the list

a 25yearold minnesota wildlife artist is the 
winner of this years government duck stamp competition besting 
more than 600 other entrants for the award 
a panel of judges on tuesday selected an acrylic painting of two 
blackbellied whistling ducks in flight by artist jim hautman of 
plymouth minn as its choice for the next duck stamp covering the 
199091 hunting season 
the federal stamps which also are purchased widely by 
collectors must be bought for licenses to hunt waterfowl 
the contest is perhaps the most prestigious in area of wildlife 
art hautman also could earn as much as 1 million from commercial 
printings and other royalties although the government pays no money 
for use of the painting 
five judges selected hautman who had entered the duck stamp 
competition four previous times after they sifted through the works 
of 603 artists during two days of judging at the interior 
departments auditorium 
more than a million of the stamps with hautmans design will be 
sold for the waterfowl hunting season bringing 1250 apiece to the 
government last year the interior department received more than 13 
million from the sale of the stamps 
although the government sold nearly 14 million stamps last year 
the demand for the stamps has been declining in recent years about 
24 million stamps were sold annually in the early 1970s

legislation to strictly control auto emissions 
is advancing in a senate committee but faces future battles when 
the full chamber debates the major initiative to clean the nations 
skies 
the auto exhaust language won a razorthin 76 victory tuesday in 
a senate environment and public works subcommittee after democrats 
refused a gop request to delay a vote while alternatives were 
considered 
the vote was along party lines although future debate would be 
more likely to find divisions between supporters and critics of the 
auto industry 
the industry and the bush administration opposed the senate 
language which will now move from the environmental protection 
subcommittee to the full committee probably next week after the 
panel debates acid rain provisions 
the senate bill would impose tough exhaust standards now 
required in california starting in 1993 and require a second round 
of reductions in 2003 that would be 50 percent stricter than the 
california requirements a rival house plan would only impose a 
second round of reductions if a study showed they were necessary 
achievable and costeffective 
william rosenberg the environmental protection agencys 
assistant administrator for air programs said it makes a lot of 
sense to substitute a plan that would let automakers choose how to 
cut emissions early in the next century 
he said the cheaper choice saving 7 billion to car purchasers 
would be to require automakers to build cars that can run on fuel 
that burns cleaner than pure gasoline 
the epa and automakers said that going beyond the california 
standards would provide only minimal pollution reductions while 
raising the average cost of a new car by 500 
sen max baucus dmont chairman of the subcommittee disputed 
the 500 figure equating the cost of tailpipe reductions in the 
next century to the purchase of a nice new hubcap 
the ranking subcommittee republican sen john h chafee of rhode 
island has drawn up a proposal that would let automakers choose the 
method of pollution reduction but he did not introduce it he asked 
instead for a delay in the vote and a hearing 
baucus refused to delay saying a postponement would prevent him 
from reporting a bill to the full senate before thanksgiving he 
agreed to hold a hearing on chafees plan nov 20 but any changes 
would have to be proposed on the senate floor he said 
the bill is not likely to be scheduled for full senate debate 
until early next year 
we ought to look at oil companies to produce cleaner fuels 
chafee said in support of his alternative why should they be let 
off the hook in doing something on clean air 
baucus said he would support an alternative fuels proposal that 
would be added to the 2003 tailpipe emissions reductions but would 
not support the plan as a substitute 
an alternative fuels proposal was a key part of president bushs 
clean air legislation a house energy and commerce subcommittee 
already has watered it down and the issue will resurface before the 
full committee 
the senate bills pollution reduction requirements for 
nonmethane hydrocarbons nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide would 
take effect a year earlier than those in the major clean air 
legislation approved by a house energy and commerce subcommittee

president bush says sure hed like to see 
cleaner campaigns but he wont apologize for the hardball tactics 
that produced his lopsided victory over democrat michael dukakis a 
year ago today 
i dont have to stand here and defend the campaign of 1988 id 
be perfectly prepared to do it but i was elected the president 
asserted and why argue with success 
bush told a news conference on tuesday i put confidence in the 
american people their ability to sort through what is fair and 
what is unfair what is ugly and what is unugly and be as positive 
as possible 
anyway negative campaigning like unugliness may be in the eye 
of the beholder bush suggested what some consider negative 
others consider factual he said 
bush wasasked his views on the negative campaigning that marked 
this years gubernatorial races in virginia and new jersey and the 
mayoral race in new york city tactics that might have been 
borrowed after all from bushs own 1988 campaign playbook 
i think everybody would prefer the positives but im not 
sure there is much that a president can do about it bush 
reflected 
he said candidates must be permitted to get their message across 
in their own way and that any restrictions on that message would 
amount to censorship 
still he continued maybe i can have a role in seeing that it 
gets a little more positive 
the virginia and new jersey races included negative campaigning 
largely from the republican side in the final days of the virginia 
race and with both candidates in new jersey comparing each other to 
a lying pinocchio complete with growing noses 
democrat l douglas wilder claimed victory over republican 
marshall coleman in virginias gubernatorial race while democrat 
james florio easily defeated republican james courter in new jersey 
bush relied heavily on negative campaigning in 1988 from his 
frequent attacks on dukakis patriotism to the constant airing of 
ads on the rape of a maryland woman by convicted murderer willie 
horton while on a weekend furlough from a massachusetts prison 
in the concluding weeks of last years race thenvice president 
bush would vow on one day to wage a gentler kinder campaign then 
the very next he would attack dukakis as a cardcarrying member 
of the american civil liberties union who would torpedo prosperity 
and bring gloom and malaise upon america 
sometimes hed voice positive lofty themes in a morning 
appearance then breathe fire later in the day 
bush campaign ads in addition to dramatizing abuses of the 
prison furlough program that dukakis oversaw as massachusetts 
governor ridiculed his rivals ride in an army tank and appeared to 
equate his veto of a pledge of allegiance bill to disrespect for the 
flag 
one of the chief architects of bushs attack campaigning media 
adviser roger ailes resurfaced this year in the gop new york 
mayoral campaign of rudolph w giuliani as did bushs 1988 
political strategist bob teeter 
bush campaigned this fall for the gop candidates in new york 
virginia and new jersey 
the president said tuesday he still has great confidence that 
americans made the right decision one year ago 
i think they sorted through some of the allegations that this 
was the ugliest dirtiest campaign and i think they voted on a more 
positive basis he said 
bush reiterated a view expressed often during the 1988 campaign 
by his campaign manager lee atwater now the chairman of the 
republican national committee that american politics were rife with 
negative campaigning from the very beginning 
i dont say anything started in 1988 that hadnt been taking 
place in 86 or 82 or 80 bush said you know if you look 
into history youre going to have certain things that are 
considered negative 
i think it ought to be a little more positive but what 
else can you do he asked im certainly not going to legislate 
it

after three of its members were 
kidnapped tortured and shot to death a leftist political party 
blamed military men and demanded that the local army commander turn 
them in for civilian prosecution 
the slaying of the young activists of the social christian 
popular movement discovered tuesday comes a week after 10 people 
were killed in the bombing of a leftist labor unions downtown 
headquarters 
leftist political leaders blame the military for both incidents 
which reflect a rise in attacks on civilians in the 10yearold 
civil war 
there are widespread fears that rightist death squads are again 
on the prowl after lying low for four years 
julio flores a social christian spokesman said military men 
dressed in civilian clothes seized the three party members monday 
night after a meeting in sonsonate a provincial capital 40 miles 
west of san salvador 
the victims were found dumped on sonsonates outskirts tuesday 
evening bearing all the hallmarks of the death squads they had been 
tortured shot repeatedly and a handlettered sign nearby said they 
were executed because they betrayed the fatherland flores 
sad 
he said in a telephone interview that the party is demanding that 
sonsonate military commander col juan armando rodriguez turn the 
soldiers involved over to civilian judicial authorities 
we hold those military officials responsible he said 
flores identified one of the victims as cecilio rivera the 
movements sonsonate coordinator he did not have riveras age or 
the names and ages of the other two he said because of poor 
telephone communications 
local judicial authorities ordered the three buried as 
unidentified corpses shortly after they were found but flores said 
party members were able to see the bodies and identified them 
the slayings a recent wave of bombings and other attacks have 
threatened to scuttle negotiations for a ceasefire in the civil war 
and to force leftist political groups back underground 
flores said social christian leaders ordered all party offices 
and halls temporarily closed tuesday because they did not want more 
members killed the authorities are threatening us they do not 
let us operate he said 
most of the more than 70000 people killed in the civil war were 
civilians slain by the rightwing death squads from 1979 to 1984 on 
suspicion of being leftists according to the roman catholic church 
and human rights groups 
death squad activity dropped sharply in mid1984 with the 
election of president jose napoleon duarte a centrist christian 
democrat but attacks on leftists picked up when rightist president 
alfredo cristiani took office june 1 for a fiveyear term 
leftist leaders accuse cristianis republican nationalist 
alliance or arena of links to the death squads which have 
enlisted offduty military and security agents 
they blame the military for bomb attacks oct 31 on the national 
workers federation or fenastras and comadres an organization of 
relatives of political prisoners and people who have disappeared in 
the war the attacks killed 10 people and injured 33 
leaders of fenastras and comadres say the bombings were in 
retaliation for a mortar attack the previous day by leftist rebels 
on the defense ministry compound that killed one civilian and 
wounded 15 
on oct 19 a bomb exploded at the home of ruben zamora the 
social christian leader but no one was hurt the movement was 
created in 1980 by dissidents who broke away from duartes christian 
democratic party 
zamora is a member of the democratic revolutionary front a 
political coalition allied with the guerrillas he returned to el 
salvador two years ago from exile after the duarte government 
promised an end to repression 
to protest the oct 31 attacks the rebel farabundo marti 
national liberation front canceled its participation in a third 
round of ceasefire negotiations with cristianis representatives 
set for nov 2021 in caracas venezuela 
earlier meetings in mexico and costa rica resulted in deadlock 
but the two sides pledged to continue meeting at 30day intervals 
until they could agree on some kind of a truce

the us customs service says its 
investigating everything from safety concerns to possible 
management coverup of problems at the agencys texas surveillance 
center where sophisticated radar planes are launched to locate 
drugsmuggling aircraft 
william green assistant commissioner for internal affairs said 
the investigation followed a lot of complaints about management 
of the surveillance support center in corpus christi where the 
hightech p3 airborne early warning aew planes are based 
customs service documents on the planes most written by crewmen 
say the aircraft have serious electronic problems that have 
diminished their ability to locate drugferrying aircraft and guide 
other customs planes pursuing the suspects 
the internal affairs investigation could be joined by a house 
probe rep glenn english dokla a government operations 
committee member who has conducted numerous hearings on customs air 
operations said tuesday he asked chairman john conyers dmich to 
hold hearings on the allegations 
weve got to get to the bottom of this said english who was 
instrumental in getting customs the 27 million for its first p3 
aew that arrived in june 1988 and more than 30 million for the 
second aew delivered last april funding has been approved for a 
third of the fourengine turboprops outfitted especially for the 
drug war by lockheed aeronautical systems co 
the customs investigation involves everything from safety 
concerns to management being aware of problems and not taking 
appropriate actions green told the associated press 
he said the investigation could touch other centers in customs 
air operations which launch interceptor and pursuit aircraft 
peter kendig acting director of the surveillance support center 
confirmed the agencys own investigation has been going on for 
about four weeks internal affairs has not talked to anyone in 
management we encourage any investigations whether from congress 
or internal affairs 
asked about allegations of a coverup kendig said there has 
never been any intention by management to gloss over problems that 
appeared in any official documents all problems have been 
identified and have been resolved or are being resolved 
one customs source speaking only on condition he not be named 
offered a different picture saying problems documented in staff 
memos were never reflected in any reports to headquarters 
were still living with the same problems 15 months down the road 
from the arrival of the first p3 aew 
the surveillance support center operates seven detection 
aircraft with the two airborne early warning planes featuring 
stateoftheart equipment that lockheed says outperforms us 
military surveillance planes 
the aew computer systems and graphic displays are designed to 
locate plans the government estimates carry about half the cocaine 
reaching the united states 
deficiencies noted in the customs service documents have included 
a computer system that has trouble locating and tracking smugglers 
faulty onboard communications for the crew and a problem with a 
spinning metal radar dome 
some reports critical of the performance of the aircraft were 
ordered rewritten by an agency supervisor to stress success and not 
failures according to the documents and customs sources

inmates at a prison near the olympic national 
forest say theres something wrong with the chow nonsense say 
prison workers the meats so fresh you can still see the tire marks 
some prisoners at the clearwater olympic corrections center say 
theyre sick of eating venison and other wild game that comes from 
illegal kills by hunters and occasionally from road kills by 
logging trucks and other vehicles 
theyve nicknamed such fare rudy stew as in rudolph the 
rednosed reindeer 
its no rarity for inmates to gripe about the food 
the difference at clearwater a minimumsecurity work camp 30 
miles from this logging town is the species they get to gripe 
about 
sometimes its deer sometimes elk 
these guys who come through that chow line dont have a 
choice said bill bevard an inmate and camp butcher thats 
what it comes down to heres the rudy stew you eat it if you 
dont like it right over there is the peanut butter jar 
i dont like it i wont eat it i took one bite and said 
thats not for me said inmate gary thomas who works in the 
kitchen and serves the fare to the 256 prisoners he has complained 
about the entrees to the state health department 
bevard said he knows of at least one instance in which no one 
inspected the meat from a deer hit by a truck 
but state corrections department officials said the roadkill 
game can be served and is inspected by a local medical authority and 
a state wildlife department official 
it really undergoes a rigorous evaulation by the wildlife 
department the game warden certifies the game as fit for human 
consumption said loye studer the departments food service 
adviser 
prison staff members eat the food too 
there is nothing that any of us are trying to hide said 
clearwaters superintendent neal brown the real issue is whether 
its illegal or not illegal to do it from our standpoint it is 
legal unfortunately if its stopped there will be a lot of good 
meat gone to waste 
prison staff members said they are tired of hearing the inmates 
bellyaching 
carla parks kitchen staff supervisor called bevard a 
complainer and said he eats it like its going out of style 
she and other staffers said they like the game if inmates dont 
like the food they said theres always the salad bar

us federal reserve to lower the federal funds rate a shortterm 
interst rate in interbank transactions

going to lower the discount rate the key lending rate to commercial

encouraged by prospects that the united states might soon ease its

kathy whitmire who led houston through the 
economically tumultuous 1980s received solid backing to steer the 
nations fourthbiggest city into the next decade with a resounding 
recordtying election victory 
we need to move houston into a great new decade that is only 
two months away mrs whitmire said tuesday night our high 
priority in the 1990s is to make sure the economic recovery benefits 
all of houston 
mrs whitmire finished with 173285 votes or 632 percent to 
87836 or 32 percent for former mayor fred hofheinz four other 
candidates shared the remainder of less than 5 percent 
mrs whitmire was the second houston mayor elected to five 
consecutive terms the first was louie welch whose 1985 comeback 
bid was squelched by mrs whitmire 
you have given me such a high honor she told supporters 
you have placed your trust in me my goal is to live up to that 
trust and to make sure our community is the greatest city anywhere 
in the world 
the loss snuffed a bid for a political comeback by hofheinz 51 
who served as mayor for two terms in the 1970s hofheinzs father 
was colorful harris county judge roy hofheinz the prime mover 
behind building of the houston astrodome 
this is not the end of anything hofheinz said it is the 
beginning of something a tremendous number of people went to the 
polls with our vision of 1990 i dont leave unhappy 
hofheinz campaign assertions that mrs whitmire had run out of 
steam after eight years on the job never appeared to take hold as 
mrs whitmire built a commanding lead in the polls and never 
relinquished it 
mrs whitmire a 43yearold accountant took office at the 
height of the oil boom but had to deal with declining revenues and 
a shattered economy when oil prices collapsed she touted her 
handling of city finances through the tough times and boasted that 
unemployment which peaked at some 13 percent is now around 5 
percent 
its been a long campaign but a fun campaign she said we 
never knew exactly what to expect we felt if we kept the campaign 
on a positive note wed win and thats what weve done i think 
there was a log of mudslinging but im ready to put that behind us

socialite kitty carlisle and pianists murray perahia and byron janis 
slowly filed past the coffin many wept others blew kisses 
i was a great fan and he gave me so many hours of listening

an agreement between house and senate 
negotiators that the bush administration also consents to would 
toughen trade sanctions against china in response to last summers 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
a compromise reached tuesday on a measure authorizing activities 
of the state department and other agencies included penalties on 
china that go beyond those imposed by bush after the tiananmen 
square massacre in june 
the sanctions included suspension of risk insurance through the 
overseas private investment corp for companies doing business in 
china suspension of trade assistance a freeze on exports of 
satellites a halt to sales of controlled munitions including 
helicopters and parts and crime control equipment and an end to 
sale of certain nuclear material and components 
the measure harshly condemned the unprovoked brutal and 
indiscriminate assault on the thousands of prodemocracy 
demonstrators in beijing on june 4 noting that at least 700 people 
died and another 27 or more were executed afterward 
the bill also condemned chinas efforts to conceal the truth of 
what happened including clandestine disposal of bodies and 
suppression of news reports 
the sanctions and the verbal condemnation were included in the 
compromise version of a twoyear 97 billion state department 
bill which now goes back to the full house and senate for final 
approval 
the measure was initially opposed by the white house because of 
the sanctions but was later accepted after rep stephen solarz 
dny chairman of the house foreign affairs asia subcommittee 
agreed to make it easier for the president to waive the penalties 
in discussions with national security adviser brent scowcroft 
solarz said the measure was altered to allow termination of the 
sanctions if the president certifies such action is in the 
national interest scowcroft reported the president would not veto 
the measure based on that provision said solarz 
the conferees also accepted a section that would impose criminal 
penalties on any government official who enlists any foreign 
government to carry out policies that are banned by us law 
the amendment grew out of the irancontra affair it was intended 
to bar use of us foreign aid as leverage with countries to support 
goals the united states cannot pursue directly because of legal 
restrictions 
it is aimed at situations like the use of us military aid for 
honduras to pressure that government to support the contra rebels 
fighting the government in nicaragua that provision could still 
provide a reason for bush to veto the bill 
the overall measure includes major boosts in aid for the united 
nations and for un peacekeeping forces they would be authorized 
to receive a total of 832 million this year and 939 million next 
year compared with 520 million last year

after a month of delay during which 2000 
contras slipped into nicaragua the security council is taking the 
unprecedented step of sending peacekeepers to central america to 
stop the border crossings 
another mission for the 625strong border patrol force will be to 
interdict shipments of nicaraguan and cuban weapons that the state 
department says are being made to leftist rebels in el salvador 
sandinista officials are to meet contra leaders in new york 
thursday and friday for talks mediated by a joint unorganization 
of american states commission honduran officials will sit in as 
observers 
the contras are insisting on reinstatement of the 19month 
ceasefire with the government president daniel ortega of nicaragua 
suspended the unilateral truce last week citing mounting rebel 
raids he said were aimed at disrupting national elections set for 
feb 25 
the contra attacks violate an aug 7 agreement by five central 
american presidents under which ortega promised the free elections 
in exchange for the demobilization of the contras by early december 
the state department says about 2000 contras infiltrated 
nicaragua in recent weeks and that now about 4000 are in nicaragua 
and 10000 remain in their bases in honduras 
the united states ceased arming the contras in february 1988 but 
the bush administration has continued to supply them with nonlethal 
eaid 
the border patrol force is the first un peacekeeping force to 
be deployed in the western hemisphere and us acceptance of it 
marks a reverse by washington 
earlier this year thenus ambassador vernon walters said 
washington opposed such a force and jeane kirkpatrick said when she 
was ambassador that un peacekeepers would never have a role in 
central america 
deployment of the force had been delayed for weeks by the failure 
of the united states to adopt a clear policy 
a us diplomat speaking privately said ambassador thomas 
pickering had won political support for the force but it took 
longer to persuade capitol hill that the 41 million cost for six 
months was worthwhile 
other officials said there was a split in the bush administration 
over whether the peacekeepers would interfere with us support for 
the contras camped in honduras 
canada west germany and spain will provide the bulk of the un 
soldiers pilots and staff for the force to be called onuca after 
the spanish initials for un observer groupcentral america 
the force will also contain a latin american contingent colombia 
and venezuela have agreed in principle to provide troops 
onuca will be a highly mobile border patrol equipped with jeeps 
helicopters and speedboats 
it will have 260 military observers 115 crew members for 12 
helicopters and an airplane 50 members for a naval unit consisting 
of speedboats and patrol boats 14 medical workers about 104 un 
staffers for administration and 82 locally recruited civilians

abortion rights leaders say victories by their 
candidates in new jersey and virginia prove the power of their issue 
and that george bush should take heed 
a spokeswoman for abortion opponents voiced displeasure with the 
way antiabortion republican candidates ran their campaigns in 
tuesdays offyear elections 
the right to choose has been proven to be a pivotal voting 
issue said kate michelman executive director of the national 
abortion rights action league 
the abortion rights group poured money into independent 
expenditure campaigns in the virginia and new jersey races for 
governor and was involved in selected legislative races in both 
states 
democrat james florio won easily in new jersey while supporting 
continued abortion rights democrat douglas wilder claimed a narrow 
victory in virginia over antiabortion republican marshall coleman 
in a race where abortion was a dominant issue 
abortion also became an issue in the virginia lieutenant 
governors race where littleknown democratic nominee don beyer 
upset republican edwina eddy dalton an opponent of abortion who 
had aired television ads highlighting the issue and seeming to 
soften her opposition 
nancy e myers spokeswoman for the national right to life 
committee the leading antiabortion group faulted colemans 
handling of the issue were frustrated that wilder was able to 
frame the debate on abortion she said 
she said her group did not work on behalf of florios republican 
opponent james courter who sought to modify his opposition to 
abortion she said the losses by courter in new jersey and dalton in 
virginia pointed up the risk of backing away from an antiabortion 
position 
eddy dalton betrayed the prolife movement in virginia she 
said she used the rhetoric of the proabortion side it was 
exactly the wrong thing to do she lost because of it 
michelman however said daltons loss to beyer proves that a 
candidates antichoice position will dog them right to the end and 
that lying wont work 
this is a wakeup call for george bush she said noting the 
presidents recent veto of a bill that would permit federally 
financed abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest 
the message to politicians everywhere is if youre out of touch 
youll be out of office she said george bush should take 
heed 
among the other races where abortion was a focus was the race for 
nassau county district attorney on long island in new york 
republican incumbent denis dillon won reelection a year after 
bolting the democratic party in protest over that partys support 
for abortion rights

political power by winning reelection handily while the citys 
lone elected black commissioner headed to whats expected to be a 
tense runoff against a cubanborn challenger 
suarez had 21946 votes or 64 percent to 12165 votes or 36 
percent for former city commissioner armando lacasa 53 
the 40yearold mayor called his landslide reelection tuesday 
a victory that clearly shows the unity of miami 
but he sees a threat to that unity in former commissioner joe 
carollo who earned a runoff against incumbent miller dawkins whos 
black 
carollo has been very divisive suarez said hes run a 
very very ethnically tinged and characterized campaign 
dawkins 64 had 13150 votes or 38 percent to 12459 votes or 
36 percent for former commissioner carollo 34 in a sixcandidate 
field 
carollo said he would appeal to all groups and rejected 
suggestions that blacks 30 percent of the citys voters should 
be assured of keeping a black representative on the commission 
the american way is not that you assign any seat to black or 
white or cuban carollo said 
dawkins said there is no such thing as a black seat but 
there being three ethnic groups in the community each group should 
have a representative we will not have a divisive campaign 
a runoff also will be held next week for the other commission 
seat up for grabs

unsuccessfully for congress was second in a sixcandidate field 
with 10044 votes or 292 percent to educator miriam alonsos

speech sponsored by the gannett center for media studies 
in the past the statecontrolled press was a laughingstock to 
its readers korotich said and nobody took it seriously under 
gorbachevs policies of glasnost or openness it has enjoyed an 
explosion of freedom with some publications printing frank 
discussions of the nations problems 
now that people believe in the press we must be honest said 
korotich who today ended a twoweek us tour 
if we lose our face now it will be tragic he said it 
will be the most dangerous tragedy and we must fight for the 
honesty and not only for us but for many of you and for many other 
countries 
on oct 13 gorbachev summoned top soviet editors including 
korotich for a twohour closeddoor lecture during which he 
expressed his fury at several liberal publications he accused them 
of working against the party or of seeking his political downfall at 
a time when the country is suffering economic and ethnic problems 
korotich said he had never seen the soviet leader so angry 
gorbachev is always soft always nice always such a very very 
polite man 
this time however he was cruel it was quite a different 
man 
according to korotich gorbachev warned the editors we are 
standing in the ocean of gasoline and you you play with the 
matches 
gorbachev reportedly said vladislav starkov editor of the soviet 
unions most popular newspaper arguments and facts should resign 
starkov has refused to quit and he is still waiting to learn his 
fate 
korotich 53 said no editor is secure including himself 
i think it will be possible to fire one editor or two 
editors but it will be impossible to change the atmosphere he 
said the atmosphere is very free 
whether from gorbachev or the more conservative factions in the 
communist party leadership korotich says the press criticism has 
been more strident 
now we have stronger and stronger speeches the press is 
guilty i always have those discussions with the party central 
committee they tell me sometimes that people dont believe in our 
system because youre writing that terrible things are happening 
i tell them that people dont believe so strongly in the soviet 
system because they dont have sausages in our supermarkets 
nevertheless korotich said he liked the stormy meeting with 
gorbachev 
i think this meeting with editors was good move played by 
gorbachev in the long and dangerous continuation he has usually 
played it was quite a professional move an interesting move but i 
still am not afraid of him you see i want to play on his team 
he said 
korotich agreed his progressive weekly is a weapon for gorbachev 
and his reforms but i never try to be personally connected in 
such a way that i call gorbachev and ask what do you want from 
me never journalism must not be personal service i support 
the idea of democratic changes and gorbachev is personally 
connected with this idea and i try to connect the magazine with the 
same idea 
korotich a member of the soviet legislature also said lawmakers 
were drafting measures to do away with censorship and make 
publications such as his independent 
he also said he has been discussing joint publishing ventures 
with several us magazines including readers digest and life

the race to fill the unexpired term of the late 
us rep mickey leland will come down to a runoff between state 
sen craig washington and city councilman anthony hall 
none of the 11 candidates in the crowded field tuesday could 
attract more than 50 percent of the vote for an outright win a 
spokesman in the texas secretary of states office said gov bill 
clements likely would schedule the runoff in middecember 
washington fell nine percentage points short of taking the seat 
winning 414 percent of the balloting or 27317 votes to halls 
344 percent or 22728 the two both democrats pulled away early 
from a pack of nine other hopefuls 
their nearest pursuer state rep ron wilson also a democrat 
picked up 4937 votes or 75 percent 
lets do it again washington said tuesday night well 
have to get my voters out one more time but were going to win 
hall vowed he would begin rallying support beginning today for 
the new race weve got to start at 630 in the morning hall 
told supporters 
preelection polls gave hall the edge over washington 32 percent 
to 24 percent but washington said being behind then did not trouble 
him 
i didnt lose faith he said those polls have a tendency 
to discourage people from voting and i think we ought to encourage 
people to vote 
hall said now that the other nine candidates have been eliminated 
from the race the runoff can focus better on the issues 
hall and washington emerged as frontrunners early in the race 
for one of texas most democratic and racially mixed districts until 
the regular election is held in 1990 
a year remains on the unexpired term of leland who was killed 
aug 7 in a plane crash in a remote jungle of ethiopia while he was 
on a famine relief trip

3088 votes or 47 percent attorney shirley fobbs 1312 or about 
2 percent businessman timothy john hattenbach 1263 or 19 
percent and lee arthur demas jr 341 or 05 percent

or 32 percent businessman manse r sharp jr 1071 or 16 
percent and education supervisor byron j johnson 1057 or 16 
percent

the 28member force of inspectors that checks 
the safety of rail shipments of hazardous chemicals is not large 
enough to ensure federal safety regulations are being obeyed 
according to the general accounting office 
its like trying to stop an elephant with a fly swatter 
kenneth m mead the gaos chief transportation expert told a house 
subcommittee tuesday you try to stop all these tank cars and 
theres another 500000 cars right behind them 
mead said the federal government cant afford to hire enough 
inspectors to look at all 11 million rail carloads of hazardous 
chemicals which move each year but that a doubling of this 
workforce would be reasonable

begin exchanging information about their arsenals next month an 
official says 
the superpowers are likely to conduct trial inspections in may a

president bush and soviet minister eduard a shevardnadze called 
for production bans in recent speeches to the un general assembly

the devilworshiping night stalker who 
murdered 13 people during a summerlong rampage that terrorized 
california told the judge who sentenced him to death that satan will 
avenge his execution 
richard ramirez wearing his trademark black sunglasses 
delivered a chilling recitation before superior court judge michael 
tynan ordered death in the gas chamber at san quentin 
you dont understand me the 29yearold ramirez told the 
crowded courtroom tuesday you are not expected to i am beyond 
your experience i am beyond good and evil i will be avenged 
lucifer dwells within us all 
a jury on sept 20 convicted him of 13 murders and 30 other 
felonies in the 1985 attacks the panel later recommended the death 
sentence 
the sentence carries an automatic appeal no executions have been 
held in california in almost 25 years 
defense attorney ray clark said appeals courts would face a novel 
issue in the case determining the impact of the slaying of one 
juror during deliberations a juror was shot to death in august by 
her boyfriend who later took his own life 
ramirez burglarized homes late at night often murdering men in 
their beds before attacking women and children satanic symbols were 
left at crime scenes and surviving victim testified of being forced 
to swear to satan 
in one murder a victims eyes were gouged out in another a 
woman testified during the trial she was raped beside the body of 
her murdered husband 
ramirez a drifter from el paso texas was captured by an east 
los angeles mob on aug 31 1985 a day after his picture appeared 
in newspapers and on television and he was identified as a suspect 
in the crime spree 
jurors some of whom said they felt the defendant tried to 
intimidate them during the trial by sneering at them returned death 
penalty recommendations on each of 19 special circumstance counts 
the jury has found death a fitting and just punishment and this 
court has ratified that judgment tynan said 
as the horrific case was brought to a close ramirez caused some 
spectators to gasp as he delivered a rambling statement 
i dont believe in the hypocritical moralistic dogma of this 
socalled civilized society he said i need not look beyond 
this oom to see all the liars the haters the killers the crooks 
the paranoid cowards truly the trematodes of the earth a parasitic 
worm 
you maggots make me sick hypocrites one and all 
deputy district attorney p philip halpin dismissed ramirezs 
words as more baloney 
i certainly wouldnt want anyone to listen to what he has to 
say because he is a pathetic human being who is grasping at some 
structure in his life halpin said

mayor coleman young overcame challenges of his 
personal and professional conduct and coasted to an unprecedented 
fifth term 
i dont know how i can thank you enough for what you have done 
tonight young told supporters late tuesday this is a great 
victory here in detroit 
once again the people of this city have proved that they are 
sophisticated they can see through any kind of propaganda and 
disinformation and come up with the truth 
with 99 percent of the precincts reporting young led challenger 
tom barrow 137466 or 56 percent to 106739 or 44 percent 
young 71 led from the earliest returns which confirmed exit 
polls showing him firmly in control 
we fought we did but were not going to blame anybody 
barrow said my opponent may be across the street with all the fat 
cats celebrating i dont care 
young told cheering crowds of supporters that they used the 
right stuff in returning him to office until 1993 which would 
give him two full decades as mayor of the nations sixthlargest 
city 
the nonpartisan race was a somewhat more competitive rematch of 
the two candidates 1985 contest young beat barrow by 61 percent to 
39 percent then 
this time again the overriding issue was youngs record 
a paternity suit filed by a former city worker was settled out of 
court and young blunted criticism of his handling of a deal in 
which the city paid 20 times more than the assessed value for land 
on which chrysler corp will build a 1 billion assembly plant 
polls released after last weeks annual devils night arson spree 
showed barrow closing to within eight percentage points with 14 
percent of voters undecided but barrow was out of town at the time 
and seemed slow to capitalize on his gains 
barrow 40 hammered away at youngs leadership style and its 
results but was largely ignored when he talked about the citys main 
issues crime schools and creating new jobs 
in declining to debate barrow young said his challenger had no 
record on anything because he had never held elected office

us and japanese officials made less progress 
than was hoped for in their talks on indirect causes of the two 
countries trade imbalance according to us officials 
only modest progress far less than we had hoped for was 
achieved in the second twoday round of new highlevel talks on 
reducing the 50 billion annual us trade deficit with japan said 
us assistant treasury secretary charles dallara 
there was very little flexibility in the japanese government 
position in reaching common ground on the nature of the 
problems even problems which do appear to be widely recognized in 
japan he told reporters tuesday night 
japanese officials would not be quoted by name one from the 
gaimusho japans foreign ministry said his country was concerned 
about many of the issues raised by the us side but progress could 
not be expected overnight 
in addition to modernizing business practices the us side has 
asked japan to consume more and spend more on such infrastructure as 
roads sewers and housing 
there is no question about the need for housing and roads but the 
solution is complicated by the shortage of land and the worlds 
highest land prices the japanese official said 
we were a little disappointed that we didnt go as far as we 
had hoped said us undersecretary of state richard mccormack a 
participant in the talks some progress was made but we would 
have hoped to have made more he said 
mccormack said the third round of the talks would be in japan in 
midjanuary shortly before japanese parliamentary elections i 
would expect there to be very intense discussions immediately 
after the japanese election mccormack added 
despite slow progress he predicted that the target would be met 
of an early spring interim report on structural changes that could 
help ease the trade imbalance 
president george bush in may announced the sii or structural 
impediment initiative to identify problems contributing to the 
trade problem stemming from lifestyles traditions and business 
practices rather than formal market barriers the us side has been 
warning that lack of concrete results could bring new pressure from 
congress next year to restrict us import of japanese goods

schoolchilden and killing a toddler who swept away in a drainage 
canal 
flood waters were receding early today in most areas drenched by 
the 24hour deluge a 70 percent chance of thunderstorms was 
forecast for today but the national weather service didnt issue 
flood warnings

everybody is susceptible to flooding said jefferson parish 
president mike yenni 
the weather service said 7 inches of rain fell on baton rouge 75 
miles to the north but dry ground quickly absorbed much of the 
water 
the downpour overcame efforts to use huge pumps in orleans and 
jefferson parishs to suck water out of the bowlshaped area and into 
lake pontchartrain 
you cant prepare for the amounts of water we had yenni 
said were still trying to prepare for 5 inches of rain in five 
hours we had one drainage station measure 10 inches 
twoyearold brian serrano of metairie wandered out of his house 
and either fell or jumped into a drainage canal said sheriffs lt 
bob garner he was swept more than a mile to a pumping station 
where two workers in a rowboat pulled his body from the water 
lightning knocked out transformers and switches blacking out 
11000 customers in the new orleans area utility officials said 
most of the electricity was restored 
many students were kept at schools into the night because of 
traffic snarls and the dangers of travel 
at least 150 homes in orleans jefferson and st bernard parishes 
were flooded an experience most owners in lowlying louisiana had 
been through before 
i lost everything all my christmas presents that i had 
purchased so far the beddings gone clothes are gone i have one 
pair of shoes left that were sitting in the van two streets down

by a paperthin margin tobaccocountry 
voters approved some limits on smoking in public places 
final unofficial returns showed the citys voters favored smoking 
restrictions by a 173vote margin 14991 to 14818 
the ordinance would ban smoking in elevators and in retail stores 
employing more than 25 people or with a capacity of more than 200 
it also would require restaurants seating more than 50 people to set 
aside a quarter of their seats for nonsmokers 
david hudgins a spokesman for the group greensboro to alleviate 
smoking pollution rejected the notion that voters were sacrificing 
jobs for their health because lorillard inc the big cigarette 
company employs about 2000 people in the area 
i dont think its going to cost you any jobs hudgins said 
its just going to give everybody a place of quiet enjoyment to go 
out and be happy together and get along 
but opponents saw the defeat as an invasion of individual rights 
i am surprised that citizens are not more concerned about 
individual rights than they showed at the polls today said earl

voters approved a new city charter that gives 
more power to the mayor and an expanded city council in the most 
sweeping overhaul of the municipal government since the fiveborough 
city was formed in 1898 
the charter that passed tuesday would wipe out the powerful 
eightmember board of estimate and transfer most of its powers to 
the mayor and a city council enlarged from 35 to 51 members 
with 99 percent of the 5243 precincts reporting the vote was 
493853 or 55 percent for proposal 2 which encompassed most of 
the changes and 410249 or 45 percent against 
frederick ao schwartz jr chairman of the commission that 
drafted the charter said it would provide a more democratic 
government a government people can understand and a more efficient 
government 
before the new charter can go into effect it must be approved by 
the justice department which under the federal voting rights act is 
charged with deciding whether local governmental changes would 
diminish minority political power the department should rule in 
december 
the us supreme court ruled in march that the citys current 
form of government specifically the board of estimate was 
unconstitutional 
created shortly after the boroughs consolidated into one city 
the board has broad authority over contracts and planning and 
approves the annual budget 
it consists of the five borough presidents who have one vote 
each and the three officials elected citywide the mayor 
comptroller and city council president who have two votes each 
since the boroughs have widely disparate populations from 
350000 in staten island to brooklyns 22 million the high court 
ruled that allowing them one vote each on the board violated the 
principle of oneperson onevote 
there were conflicting impressions citywide whether the board 
would end up improving or diminishing the influence of selected 
boroughs and their ethnic populations 
staten island the citys least populated borough was the one 
clear loser some of its residents have formed a secessionist party 
to consider leaving new york 
the boroughs residents however ousted incumbent borough 
president ralph lamberti who was a strong opponent of the new 
charter running both as a democrat and a secessionist 
guy molinari who defeated lamberti said i think that i can 
work very well with the new charter 
if the charter is accepted by the justice department budget 
authority would pass to the city council in january and the board 
of estimate would disappear in september

most commercial banks are likely to cut 
shortterm interest rates in response to steps taken over the past 
two days by federal reserve officials according to a published 
report 
financial analysts predict the fed action means that most banks 
are likely to cut their 105 percent prime lending rate to 10 
percent probably before the end of the week according to todays 
editions of the washington post 
sources told the post the decision to cut shortterm rates was 
made monday during a telephone conference call meeting of the feds 
top policymaking group the federal open market committee 
later that day the nations central bank began to supply extra 
cash to the banking system and followed tuesday with a similar move 
the newspaper said those actions resulted in the federal funds rate 
being lowered from 875 percent to just over 85 percent the paper 
said 
the federal funds rate is the interest rate financial 
institutions charge one another on overnight loans its level 
broadly determines most other shortterm interest rates 
the drop in the federal funds rate is the fifth since the fed 
began to loosen its control on credit at the end of may which 
marked the reversal of a yearlong effort to hold down inflation by 
slowing growth the most recent previous cut came last month after a 
sharp drop in the stock market 
the post said that in mondays decision fed officials were 
responding to recent statistics that have convinced many economists 
that growth will drop to the 1 percent or 2 percent range by early 
next year the lowest since 1986 
the federal reserve did not announce its decision and a fed 
spokesman declined to comment on whether the central bank had 
changed its policy the newspaper said

state house and senate leaders said defeat 
of a pay raise for lawmakers doesnt mean texans are demanding 
ethics reform but others in and out of government say thats 
exactly what the voters meant 
the defeat of proposition 1 shows that texans want reform 
before raises said tom smith director of the government watchdog 
group public citizen 
in final unofficial returns the payraising proposition 1 was 
defeated by nearly 2to1 
lawmakers had sought to more than triple their pay from 7200 a 
year to 23300 and to eliminate the need for voter approval of 
future raises 
but several lawmakers and activists said revelations that 
lobbyists spent nearly 2 million this year to entertain legislators 
along with tricky ballot wording doomed the amendment 
its a good thing there wasnt a ballot alternative that said 
legislators pay should be lowered said state sen chet edwards 
the pay raise and its companion proposition 11 to raise 
lawmakers daily expense allowance from 30 to 81 were the only 
losers among the 21 constitutional amendments on tuesdays ballot 
voters aproved a referendum to remove from the oath of office 
taken by public officials the denial that they bribed anyone 
officials still would be required to sign a written statement 
swearing that they didnt bribe anybody

voters statewide overwhelmingly rejected an 
initiative that would have raised 360 million for childrens 
programs 
called the childrens initiative it won only 33 percent of 
tuesdays vote with 91 percent of precincts reporting 
opponents said the measure was vague would hurt working families 
through a tax increase and amounted to a blank check for 
bureaucrats 
i am really stunned it was such a big landslide victory said 
cathy mickels head of mothers campaign for family the 
oppositions point group that tells me the taxpayers of the 
state who have been generous in the past with their tax dollars 
are tired of their money being wasted 
backers including gov booth gardner said the money was needed 
for smaller school classes early childhood education childabuse 
and drug education as well as family services the money would have 
been divided equally between childrens services and schools 
its always difficult to pass a tax increase said jon 
leveque initiative campaign chairman 
if passed the initiative would have required the legislature to 
raise the money in the next fiscal year the measure could have 
increased king countys sales tax to 9 percent 
washington voters have never passed a general tax hike although 
they approved a state income tax in 1932 that later was thrown out

whether key us interest rates would fall 
gold prices were higher but off their overnight peaks 
dealers said thursdays scheduled release of us producer price 
figures for october could provide some clues to the direction of

a higherthanexpected figure would probably leave interest rates 
untouched they said while the federal reserve could have grounds 
to loosen credit policy if the figure is in line with the 02 
percent rise analysts have predicted 
the postponement of a treasury auction tuesday added fuel to 
speculation about an imminent cut in us rates dealers said

germany could start casting a shadow over the deutsche mark

jewett 43 helped draft the socalled save our schools 
initiative and used it as his main campaign vehicle only to watch 
it run out of gas 
rice who had announced he would not run for mayor again after 
losing to incumbent charles royer in 1985 and failing in a bid for 
congress last year changed his mind and entered the 30 minutes 
before the filing deadline he cited the antibusing initiative as 
the main reason 
rice defeated jewett 93491 votes to 67276 or 58 percent to 42 
percent 
the fate of the initiative was undecided with 999 percent of the 
vote counted the count was 64447 against to 64377 in favor or 
5004 percent yes to 4996 percent no 
hear me well hear me well rice told cheering supporters 
seattle can be proud of itself tonight proud because were a 
thinking people a thinking city and a city that cares and a city 
that lives up to the progressivity that stands so high and makes it 
the most livable city in the united states 
rices victory was particularly notable in light of the fact only 
10 percent of the citys population is black 
the seattle election was one of several that resulted in firsts 
for blacks l douglas wilder of virginia claimed victory as the 
nations first black elected governor and david dinkins as the first 
black mayor of new york 
the initiative asked but did not require the independently 
elected and selfbudgeting city school board to halt mandatory 
busing of students for racial balance in exchange about 45 
million in city tax revenue would be earmarked for magnet 
programs to achieve racial balance in school enrollment 
early in the evening rice received congratulatory telephone 
calls from dinkins the rev jesse jackson democratic national 
committee chairman ron brown and sen ted kennedy dmass 
only after jewett conceded at 1120 pm pst however did rice 
claim victory 
jewett a moderate republican who once tried to form a third 
party said he might have lost because of his gop affiliation in the 
strongly liberal democratic city 
norm and i started the race as friends and weve ended the race 
as friends and i look forward to supporting norm in every way 
possible during his administration as mayor jewett said 
royer who served an unprecedented three fouryear terms as mayor 
and is a former president of the national league of cities has 
accepted the position of director of the institute of politics at 
the john f kennedy school of government at harvard university

city voters rejected a new baseball stadium 
for the san francisco giants and a domestic partners law while 
suburban concord repealed a measure that banned discrimination 
against people with aids 
san francisco mayor art agnos who campaigned hard for the new 
ballpark conceded defeat early today on the measure known as 
proposition p with all 621 precincts counted 86592 or 505 
percent voted tuesday against it to 84618 or 494 percent in 
favor 
city election workers still had 2000 to 3000 absentee ballots 
to count but agnos said it wont be enough to make a 
difference the measure called for construction of a new stadium 
to replace candlestick park for the national league champions 
giants owner bob lurie said the team would play at cold windy 
foggy candlestick next year but was uncertain where the club would 
play in 1991 
the giants and their fans now face an uncertain future lurie 
said 
opponents said the new ballpark was unnecessary and untimely 
considering san franciscos other postearthquake needs the measure 
would have committed san francisco to contributing 40 million for a 
waterfront stadium in china basin four miles south of candlestick 
expense also was an issue in proposition s designed to provide 
the same legal rights received by married couples to unmarried city 
workers living together as domestic partners 
the measure appeared to lose 84060 to 82342 with the absentee 
votes out 
backers said all the measure does is extend hospital visitation 
and bereavement leave to these couples but opponents feared it 
would open the door to providing other rights and expensive services 
later 
voters passed a measure calling for the sale of 60 million in 
bonds for repairs from damage due to the earthquake three weeks ago 
the measure passed 143453 or 872 percent to 20995 or 127 
percent 
in concord a city of about 100000 that is 40 miles east of san 
francisco voters passed an initiative to repeal a city 
councilpassed ordinance banning discrimination against anyone 
suffering from aids or testing positive for the virus that causes 
the deadly disease 
the final vote was 13438 to 10514 
fliers sent out before the election criticized the ordinance as 
giving special benefits to prostitutes drug addicts and homosexuals 
all at high risk of contracting aids 
health officials however rallied behind the measure saying 
they believed it would help slow the spread of aids by encouraging 
potential victims to seek testing treatment and education without 
fear of reprisal 
in the southern california city of irvine voters approved a 
measure that denies homosexuals protection under a municipal 
antidiscrimination ordinance 11482 to 10328 the measure removes 
the phrase sexual orientation from irvines humanrights 
ordinance which bans discrimination based on age sex religion 
race disability or marital status

former president reagan apologized 
to the entertainment industry for his recent criticism of american 
tv and movies but said hollywood should forge a new code for 
selfcensorship 
reagans speech to more than 1000 members of the hollywood radio 
and television society was billed as an address on the unfinished 
business of his presidency but he focused instead on his comments 
in japan last month denigrating us film and tv productions 
the former actor said tuesday the industry should voluntarily 
police vulgarity and tastelessness to avoid government intervention 
the federal government has tried to interfere too much and too 
often said reagan 
censorship or restriction should be within he said 
suggesting voluntary standards similar to the hays code which held 
sway through the 1950s 
reagan said he was appalled by what he sees in movies and on 
television 
you can call me a blockhead or a prude if you want but if 
i was offered a script and told i had to say those words i would 
have turned down the script he said 
reagan said in japan that he supported sonys 34 billion 
acquisition of columbia pictures entertainment corp 
im not too proud of hollywood these days with the immorality 
that is shown in pictures and the vulgarity he said in a tv 
interview broadcast oct 25 in japan 
i just have a feeling that maybe hollywood needs some outsiders 
to bring back decency and good taste to some of the pictures that 
are being made 
reagan began his speech tuesday with his apology 
im sorry i was a little tardy in getting here today he 
said you see my dentist was running late he had a little 
difficulty in removing from my mouth the last piece of shoe leather 
i acquired in japan 
im glad he did though otherwise i wouldnt be able to enjoy 
this wonderful lunch theres nothing like crow souffle followed by 
humble pie 
the former president also defended the 2 million a japanese 
company paid him for a series of appearances 
thats what was offered and i didnt protest i just 
thought that in 16 years i hadnt made any kind of money reagan 
said

many people and the lies she told finally caught up with her

infants wouldbe mother turned the child over to authorities the

a judge who said she wanted to keep a 
child molester from slinking back into the dark has ordered the 
man to buy a newspaper ad with his picture an apology and a plea 
for others to get help 
superior court judge corinne p grande gave stephen 
germershausen 29 until friday to buy the 4 by 6inch ad in the 
providence journalbulletin the judge on oct 26 also placed 
germershausen on 35 years probation 
he pleaded guilty to fondling three children ages 8 to 11 and 
sexually assaulting one of them two years ago 
i thought if he goes to jail thats good because hell be 
locked up and while hes locked up hes not going to hurt anybody 
anymore grande said 
but then i thought once he got out hed go slinking back into 
the dark and no one ever would know what he had done 
grande said there doesnt appear to be a sufficient social 
response to people like stephen germershausen so i thought about 
other children and wondered whether i could use the sentencing 
process to effect some change 
i think that this type of punishment by humiliation is not an 
appropriate form of punishment said stephen brown executive 
director of the rhode island chapter of the american civil liberties 
union 
defense attorney robert b mann said that germershausen had 
undergone intensive therapy and that a report suggested he was no 
longer a threat 
gerhershausens picture must carry a caption that identifies him 
as a child molester and also reads 
if you are a child molester get professional help immediately 
or you may find your picture and name in the paper and your life 
under control of the state this ad is being published by order of 
the superior court judge who sentenced me 
grande also ordered germershausen to contribute 1000 to a 
program to help child victims of sexual abuse 
in portland ore a judge in 1987 ordered a child molester to 
hang a sign on his door warning children to stay away judges in 
florida have ordered people convicted of drunken driving to use 
bumper stickers announcing their misdeeds

the state police commander faces an fbi 
probe and calls for his firing over his departments practice of 
secretly taping telephone calls between suspects and their lawyers 
i dont think he should be around anymore state rep richard 
tulisano said of col lester j forst 
after the taping was disclosed tuesday us attorney stanley a 
twardy jr ordered the fbi to investigate and gov william a 
oneill ordered a halt to the taping at state police barracks the 
practice was disclosed tuesday by the hartford courant 
i was not aware such a practice existed and my immediate 
reaction is that it is unnecessary and inappropriate the governor 
said in a statement 
forst was on vacation in alaska and unavailable for comment 
tuesday he was appointed by oneill in 1981 
the courant reported that state police routinely record virtually 
all calls to and from their barracks and have taped calls between 
suspects and lawyers for at least a year and possibly as long as 10 
years at some barracks 
sgt richard j sealander jr a state police spokesman defended 
the taping as harmless saying police do not actually monitor the 
conversations 
no one is listening to the tapes he said 
the practice stunned defense attorneys who called the taping 
blatantly illegal and said it could jeopardize past and present 
cases and expose the state police to lawsuits large fines and 
criminal charges 
that is really scary unbelievable outrageous said lawyer 
hubert j santos there goes the right to counsel 
i would think that pending cases are subject to dismissal and 
that convictions are likely to be overturned said margaret levy 
a defense attorney 
oneill called the policy deeply disturbing and assigned 
attorney general clarine nardi riddle the chief states attorney 
and the governors legal counsel to investigate 
tulisano called for forsts dismissal 
if i were a state police officer i would be damned upset to 
find out that every conversation i had with anybody even my spouse 
was being taperecorded by my supervisors tulisano said

jordanians voted for a new parliament today 
in the first nationwide elections in 22 years part of a democratic 
initiative by king hussein after riots over price increases left 10 
people dead 
a phase has ended in our lives and a new one is beginning 
today hussein told reporters during a visit to the campaign press 
center 
nearly 259000 voters cast ballots by noon almost 30 percent of 
those eligible interior ministry spokesman salameh hamad said 
women voted for the first time in a general election since winning 
the right in 1974 
in the first nationwide election since jordan renounced claims to 
the israelioccupied west bank 648 candidates including 12 women 
ran for 80 seats hussein said the new parliament would be 
convened soon and that he would name a new cabinet shortly after 
that 
first returns were expected late today and officials said they 
hoped to have complete but unofficial results on thursday 
the revamped parliament with no representatives from the west 
bank of the jordan river put the seal on husseins decision to 
recognize the palestine liberation organizations claim to the area 
israel captured the west bank in the 1967 middle east war loss 
of the territory which held half of the 60 seats in the old 
parliament had made national elections impossible 
hussein suspended parliament in 1974 and revived it a decade 
later jordans monarchs have used their powers repeatedly to 
suspend the legislature and the previous parliament was passive 
under the new system parliament must approve all laws and can 
override a royal veto and remove cabinets 
despite martial law and a 33yearold ban on political parties 
the kings government allowed political groups to run slates openly 
for the first time since 1956 it was one of the most open contests 
ever held in the arab world 
competing for the support of 877000 registered voters were 
islamic fundamentalists tribal sheiks communists businessmen and 
former political prisoners 
urban candidates addressed rallies attended by thousands while 
some rural aspirants offered traditional camelmeat feasts to voters 
at bedouin camps the fundamentalist moslem brotherhood last week 
held the campaigns largest rally attracting more than 5000 people 
to a soccer field near downtown amman 
there is no organized governing party and the leader or party 
that succeeds in forming a government will have to forge alliances 
to gain a parliamentary majority 
political observers predicted the moslem brotherhood could gain 
between 12 and 20 seats in parliament making it a major bloc 
they are going to help the poor people mufad abdullah a 
23yearold unemployed vocational school graduate said of the 
moslem brotherhood he spoke at a rally attended by several hundred 
people chanting the partys slogan god is great islam is the 
solution 
the new parliament must deal with rising unemployment and a 50 
percent fall in the value of the national currency the dinar which 
sent prices of imported goods soaring 
with few natural resources to support its 3 million people 
jordan is suffering an economic crisis brought about partly by a 
drop in money sent home by jordanian workers in persian gulf 
countries where the oil boom has ended 
april riots against price increases for gasoline auto fees 
telephone service heating oil cigarettes and alcoholic beverages 
led to the resignation of prime minister zaid rifais government

at the top 10 its quite obvious it was one black one korean one 
japanese one hearing impaired one kidney implant and of course 
texas and florida were part of the top 10 it makes you wonder

voters streamed to the polls today many 
after being thwarted by long lines the day before to elect an 
assembly that is to write a constitution and declare namibia 
independent from south africa 
many voters camped overnight to keep their places in line after 
they were unable to reach the polling booths tuesday 
fred eckhard spokesman for the un monitoring force said about 
30 percent of the 701483 registered voters cast their ballots 
tuesday a figure he called extremely encouraging 
several polling stations on tuesday stayed open hours past 
closing time while others ran out of ballots and ink as they 
accomodated the crush of voters at least one line was a mile long 
lines were shorter today the second of five days of 
unsupervised balloting in the predominantly black territory for 
the 72member assembly seats will be allocated according to the 
proportion of votes each of the 10 political parties receive 
officials said voting could be extended to sunday if necessary 
and that results could be announced on wednesday of next week 
eckhard said there had been scattered incidents of intimidation 
and distribution of bogus pamphlets aimed at discrediting the 
favored party the southwest africa peoples organization known as 
swapo these actions degrade a process which is otherwise being 
carried out with selfcontrol and dignity he said 
the main election issue is whether the leftleaning swapo which 
fought a 23year guerrilla war will get the twothirds of the seats 
necessary to write a charter without consulting any of the other 
parties 
its main rival is the democratic turnhalle alliance a 
multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy and was part 
of a transitional government installed by south africa 
the chairman of the alliance white farmer dirk mudge accused 
the south african government and news media of deciding in advance 
that swapo was sure to win 
we are already fighting an uphill battle without it being made 
more difficult he said 
eckhard said un officials were investigating allegations that 
alliance supporters forced angolans across the northern namibian 
border and pressured them to vote he stressed that no one could 
vote who had not already been registered 
gerhard roux spokesman for the territorial government said 
the people of our country will forever remember the feeling of 
expectation and election fervor of the day 
he said one cause of the long delays was the large number of 
people who arrived to vote without bringing identification or voter 
registration cards 
some white south africans eligible to vote because they used to 
live in namibia flew on special chartered flights to vote at 
windhoeks airport 
to reach some remote areas of the sparsely populated territory 
helicopters were being used as mobile polling booths flying to a 
different village each day 
an estimated 60 percent of namibias voters are illiterate the 
318252squaremile territory rich in minerals had a population of 
13 million in 1981 when the last census was taken 
sporadic violence and intimidation marred the fourmonth 
campaign including the assassination sept 12 of anton lubowski 
the only prominent white member of swapo 
south africa captured southwest africa from germany in 1915 and 
governed it under a league of nations mandate 
the united nations revoked the mandate in 1966 and after south 
africa refused to leave the swapo insurgency began more than 
20000 people most of them guerrillas were killed in the bush war 
last year south africa agreed to a unbrokered accord calling 
for namibias transition to independence swapo leader sam nujoma 
said the group would accept any election result certified by the 
united nations

striking arctic miners said today that talks with 
the minister of the coal industry have broken down and that they 
feared the government was preparing to crack down on the 2weekold 
walkout 
coal industry minister mikhail shchadov left vorkuta after 
failing in a meeting monday to convince workers to return to their 
jobs and warning that the strikers could be held financially 
responsible for losses said sergei kozlov a strike leader at the 
vargashor mine 
everything is ready for repression kozlov said a regional 
court on oct 27 found the strike to be illegal and mine directors 
have started taking the names of workers who organized the walkouts 
he said 
vargashor is the largest of a dozen mines on strike in the arctic 
coal basin miners there walked off their jobs oct 25 complaining 
that the government had not improved living and working conditions 
as it promised in july 
the government was forced to make those promises to end a 
nationwide walkout last summer of thousands of coal miners during 
this strike miners also have made political demands that include 
removing an article of the soviet constitution that declares the 
communist party to be the leading force in soviet society 
miners want moscow to send a commission that is empowered to 
negotiate the miners demands kozlov said 
we dont care who leads it as long as they have the power to 
decide he said kozlov added that some miners want premier 
nikolai i ryzhkov to negotiate with them 
ryzhkov on sunday appealed to the miners in a telegram to go back 
to work because the country is short on coal as the winter season 
approaches he said the governments record on fulfilling its 
promises will be reviewed at a meeting in moscow on nov 17 
but kozlov said the miners did not return to work because ryzhkov 
had not offered them anything 
miners estimates of the number who have walked off their jobs 
have varied between 15000 and 30000 
the news agency tass said coal production in the area was 236000 
tons short of the target for the first six days of november

prime minister hun sen said today that 
civil war in his country is unavoidable because other nations are 
funneling arms to guerrillas bent on testing his government on the 
battlefield 
in an interview with the official cambodian news agency spk hun 
sen downplayed recent victories by a threeparty opposition 
coalition that includes the khmer rouge and two noncommunist groups 
he accused china the united states france the united kingdom 
singapore malaysia and thailand of involvement in the military 
activities of the guerrillas 
hun sen said a number of countries had not honored their 
commitments to cease military aid to the coalition after vietnam 
said it completed the withdrawal of all its forces in late 
september rebels say some of the troops remain 
hence a civil war is inevitable in cambodia the khmer 
reactionary forces and their outside supporters are intending to 
make a test of forces in the military field within six months before 
they engage in a new round of talks hun sen said 
we are still advocating the settlement of the conflict through 
negotiations he said in the interview that took place in phnom 
penh was carried by spk and monitored in bangkok 
he said the first stage of the guerrillas strategy was to seize 
the northwestern provinces of battambang siem reap and bantey 
meanchey 
over the past months the enemy have made the highest possible 
efforts in their military campaigns involving almost all the armed 
forces of the three khmer reactionary factions he said 
but he said the coalitions noisy claims about their socalled 
victories are nothing but a ploy of their psychological warfare 
since the vietnamese troop pullout the khmer rouge have seized 
the gemmining town of pailin and moved towards cambodias 
secondlargest city battambang the khmer peoples national 
liberation front and a group loyal to coalition leader prince 
norodom sihanok have captured a number of government positions in 
the northwest 
the cambodian army is supplied by weapons from the soviet union 
and until last month was backed by a formidable vietnamese force 
which invaded the country in late 1978 
hun sen accused china the united states france and singapore of 
shipping military supplies to the guerrillas while thailand the 
united kingdom malaysia and the united states have trained the two 
noncommunist groups china alone hun sen said was training the 
khmer rouge 
the prime minister said chinese american and thai military 
advisors plus some thai mercenaries had joined the guerrillas during 
the recent offensive 
the united states denies sending lethal aid to the two 
noncommunist factions but provides other forms of assistance china 
and thailand have long been the major backers of the coalition

a powerful car bomb exploded today in 
syrianpoliced west beirut killing four people and wounding 19 
the blast came shortly before the expected arrival of newly 
elected president rene mouawad in the citys moslem sector 
the boobytrapped car went off in the caracas neighborhood about 
three blocks from the posh villa where mouawad planned to stay 
the presidential palace traditional seat of the head of state 
is occupied by rebellious army commander gen michel aoun who 
rejected mouawads election sunday by members of parliament under a 
peace plan aoun opposes 
the peace plan shifts political power to the moslem majority and 
aoun has specifically criticized it for not including a timetable 
for a withdrawal of syrias estimated 40000 troops 
police said four people were killed and 19 wounded in the blast 
today window glass of apartment and office buildings was shattered 
by the 315 pm explosion 
half a dozen cars were set ablaze in a parking lot as syrian 
soldiers clutching ak47 rifles converged on the scene they fired 
in the air to make way for ambulances and fire engines that raced to 
area the witnesses said insisting on anonymity 
also today the lebanese communist party chief was quoted as 
saying his militia may try to kill aoun for rejecting the election 
of mouawad a 64yearold maronite catholic 
sources said that before the end of the week mouawad would 
announce formation of a national reconciliation government to end 14 
years of civil war 
george hawi secretarygeneral of the syrianbacked communist 
party was quoted as saying his militia has among its ranks other 
fighters such as soha bishara who tried to kill renegade lebanese 
army maj antoine lahd in south lebanon last year lahd was wounded 
and treated in israel 
i stress that soha bishara who managed to strike at the head of 
treason in south lebanon is capable of reaching the head of the 
secessionists and mutineers in east beirut he told the party 
newspaper annida 
miss bishara is still being held by lahds israelibacked 
militia the south lebanon army which helps patrol israels 
selfdesignated security zone in south lebanon 
the party comprises a few hundred fighters most of them of 
christian families 
aoun who headed a christian cabinet in a dual government that 
ruled for 13 months opposes mouawad because the president advocated 
close ties with syria the main power broker in lebanon aoun fought 
the syrians for six months this year until an arab league truce was 
enforced in september 
aoun commanded about 20000 christian troops during the fight 
against syria but it remains unclear how many troops will continue 
to back him in the confrontation with mouawad

the first securities market since the 
communists took power 43 years ago was formally established today 
and one newspaper reported the exchange will develop into a 
fullfledged stock market 
the financial and securities market to begin operating dec 31 
will at first deal only in shortterm documents such as banking 
certificates and will initially be used only by financial 
institutions said the official tanjug news agency 
it will eventually evolve into a full stock market allowing 
individual citizens to participate reported the 
governmentsupervised newspaper borba 
we are preparing to have in the future a stock market like any 
other which will also be connected to international markets 
said dragutin gajic an advisor in the yugoslav national bank in an 
interview with the daily 
the exchange is a major landmark in efforts of premier ante 
markovic to radically reform yugoslavias stagnating economy and 
bring it into line with western economic practices 
the government is seeking parliamentary approval for legislation 
allowing governmentowned and private enterprises and other 
institutions to issue stocks and bonds which would be dealt with on 
the newlyestablished exchange 
founding of the exchange was one of the conditions set by the 
international monetary fund at last weeks round of negotiations 
aimed at providing yugoslavia with continued financial support 
according to press reports 
the communists abolished yugoslavias three existing stock 
exchanges in belgrade zagreb and ljubljana when they created a 
centrally planned economy along soviet lines in 1946 
yugoslavia is currently faced with an annual inflation rate 
approaching 1500 percent a 17 billion foreign debt and rising 
unemployment economic performance has stagnated throughout the past 
decade 
markovics 6monthold government is committed to introducing 
market mechanisms into the economy as a way out of the crisis and 
has already allowed for largescale private enterprise and foreign 
investment a sweeping reform of the countrys innefficient banking 
system is also under way

more than 250 people who worked at the chernobyl 
nuclear power plant during the 1986 accident or helped clean up 
after it have died a newspaper reported today 
the toll reported by the weekly moscow news was far higher than 
the official toll of 31 killed in the april 26 1986 explosion and 
fire at the plant in the soviet ukraine 
a spokesman for the government agency that is responsible for the 
chernobyl cleanup acknowledged the figure of 250 dead but said only 
the 31 could be traced directly to the disaster the worlds worst 
atomic accident 
more than 250 people of those who were at work at the time of 
the explosion or worked on liquidating the consequences of the 20th 
centurys greatest accident have already died moscow news said 
it said they died of various illnesses and that no one can tell 
what the full human cost of the disaster will be 
the article on a new association of those concerned about the 
accident did not say what the source of the figure was or provide 
any more details of it 
the government newspaper izvestia also printed a report on the 
association which calls itself simply chernobyl but it did not 
use such a figure 
however it did say that many of those who worked for a long 
time in conditions that were dangerous for their health need help 
today 
alexander karasyuk an engineer and spokesman for the kombinat 
organization that is handling the cleanup said in a telephone 
interview from kiev we cant say that those 250 died directly 
from illnesses caused by radiation 
karasyuk said he is a member of the chernobyl association 
the register of the dead included some people who died of 
illnesses from which they suffered even before an explosion and fire 
ripped through chernobyls no 4 reactor more scientific study was 
needed he said 
further information on the figures could not be obtained 
immediately most offices in the soviet union were closed because 
today was taken as a holiday after the celebration of the 72nd 
anniversary of the bolshevik revolution 
the figure of 31 dead which officials have used as the death 
toll since just months after the accident includes 28 people who 
died of radiation sickness two who died of burns and one who had a 
heart attack trying to put out the fire karasyuk said 
officials say they give regular medical checkups to thousands of 
people who were exposed to radiation in the accident a radiation 
center in kiev about 80 miles south of the power plant has files 
on about 600000 people the kombinat spokesman said 
after the accident which released a cloud of radioactive 
material that circled the world soviet officials evacuated 
thousands of people in an 18mile zone around the plant 
the chernobyl accident already has cost the soviet union billions 
of dollars and spawned a strong antinuclear movement a report in 
march said almost a quartermillion people still were living on land 
so contaminated that they cannot eat food grown on it and three 
years after the accident officials still are evacuating more people 
from the area surrounding the plant

nelson mandela jailed leader of the 
african national congress appealed today for unity among rival 
black organizations according to lawyers who conferred with him 
his message is about unity that people should forget about 
petty differences said keith kunene one of three officials of 
the black lawyers association who met with mandela for more than 
three hours 
the meeting came amid speculation mandela is spearheading an 
effort to reconcile the african national congress and a rival 
guerrilla movement the pan africanist congress a leader of the pan 
africanist congress jafta masemola has been invited to visit 
mandela for several days starting thursday 
mandela the bestknown black leader in south africa despite 
having been jailed since 1962 sent an invitation two weeks ago to 
the lawyers 
one of them ernest moseneke was a fellow prisoner of mandela 
for 10 years after being convicted at age 15 of illegal activities 
on behalf of the pan africanist congress another of the lawyers 
godfrey pitje worked closely with mandela in the african national 
cogress youth league in the 1950s and early 60s 
it was very exciting said pitje of his first sight of 
mandela since 1964 i had a difficult task stopping the tears from 
flowing 
mandela 71 was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for 
plotting antigovernment sabotage and currently lives in a former 
staff residence at victor verster prison farm outside cape town 
last month eight political prisoners including masemola and 
five of mandelas codefendants in the 1964 trial were freed 
unconditionally mandelas release is widely expected within the 
next few months 
the lawyers said mandela declined to discuss the prospects of his 
release they said he tried unsuccessfully to arrange for the 
release of two other political prisoners last month but they did 
not elaborate 
the african national congress and the pan africanist congress 
have differed bitterly over political philosophy the african 
national congress includes white supporters while the pan africanist 
congress advocates black selfreliance in the struggle to end 
apartheid 
kuene said mandela does not view himself as a oneman force that 
will bring negotiations about 
he said no one single person can tackle the issue of 
negotiation its a matter for all the organization not for 
individuals said kunene 
moseneke said mandela is in excellent condition physically and 
has an amazingly retentive memory

bin was incapable of inflicting anything more harmful than a paper 
cut 
several people mistook the lifesize cardboard cutout of late 
actor and pro football player john matuszak holding a large pistol 
for a reallife bad guy monday one person even flattened himself 
against the ground to avoid being shot 
after receiving numerous calls los angeles police officers 
surrounded the area and moved in cautiously before determining the 
gunman had been a promotional display for the movie one man 
force and was destined for the garbage collector

seeking comment on whether whether kemp planned to exempt lowincome 
housing units in other cities

rule change to help fill the agencys 1200 vacant onebedroom 
apartments homeless people will get first claim on 400 to 600 of 
the units to be made available starting this winter he said

housing agencys waiting list he said 
we will continue to take care of families who need help 
thats our ongoing responsibility kemp said but for the first 
time we are going to allow public housing rules to be changed so 
that single men and women who are homeless can also have access to 
public housing units

services ltd which is owned partly by the israeli government

black democrats scoring precedentshattering 
victories in mayoral elections around the nation are taking control 
of city hall for the first time in new york seattle and other 
cities while regaining it in cleveland 
virginias douglas wilder challenged a centuryold racial barrier 
and claimed a thin margin of victory in his race for governor while 
blacks extended and solidified their control of some of the nations 
biggest cities in tuesdays oddyear elections 
its an excellent testament to the people of virginia to the 
people of this nation as to how far weve come in a very short span 
of time wilder said on nbcs today show declaring himself 
the winner and the nations first elected black governor 
the republican whip in the house rep newt gingrich of georgia 
acknowledged the gains for black democrats 
i think a clear signal was sent that americans will vote for 
the best qualified candidates gingrich said on the cbs this 
morning show while i really wish our guys had won there is 
something fundamentally good for this country 
jesse jackson the twotime black presidential contender said 
these gains represent expansion for the group that was locked 
out 
in the main mayoral event david dinkins won election in new york 
over republican rudolph giuliani the first time a black has been 
elected mayor of the nations largest city 
other democrats who won election as mayor and who will become 
the first blacks to head their cities were john daniels in new 
haven conn chester jenkins in durham nc and norm rice in 
seattle 
michael white was elected in cleveland succeeding white 
republican george voinovich 
detroit mayor coleman young who is black won a fifth fouryear 
term by defeating black challenger tom barrow 
dinkins election in new york and wilders claim to a narrow 
victory in the virginia governors race raised the likelihood a new 
array of elected black leaders would gain national prominence 
rep william gray dpa the house majority whip and the 
nations highest black elected figure praised dinkins election and 
said new york voters have rejected the politics of fear dinkins 
withstood late campaign attacks on his character and integrity 
gray said wilders apparent success gives us all hope hope 
that america is maturing and that people are able to make decisions 
without regard to race but on the issues 
the offyear election put democratic blacks in control of most of 
the nations big city mayors offices going into tuesdays 
balloting new york chicago and houston were the nations biggest 
cities with a white mayor 
houston voters returned kathy whitmire to office tuesday and 
miami voters did the same for xavier suarez 
white was elected clevelands new mayor by defeating longtime 
city council president george forbes in a bitter contest between two 
black candidates who once were allies his victory gives the city 
its first black mayor since carl stokes left office nearly two 
decades ago the first of the bigcity black mayors 
the candidacies of wilder virginias democratic lieutenant 
governor and dinkins the manhattan borough president were 
noteworthy for their similar methods both ran as mainstream 
middleoftheroad candidates who stressed their experience in 
elected office 
they projected an image that was far from the fierypreacher and 
populist outsider appeal of jackson in fact wilders campaign 
deliberately kept jackson at arms length for fear of alienating 
white voters 
both dinkins and wilder appealed for broad support from white 
voters while counting on neartotal support from black voters 
both of these candidates who had a fairly similar strategy in 
some ways will be viewed as role models said linda williams a 
fellow at harvards kennedy school of government specializing in 
race and politics for the future direction of black politics 
there will be a lot of inspiration about what can be done 
wilder was seeking to become the first black governor of a state 
since reconstruction and the first black elected governor ever 
daniels elected in new haven is a veteran connecticut state 
senator who easily defeated republican alderwoman robie pooley 
in durham jenkins victory came in a closely contested 
nonpartisan race with conservative candidate nelson strawbridge 
the election symbolizes heightened security and maturity for 
white males in america jackson said in the 60s we integrated 
the lunch counters and the libraries now we are integrating the 
psyche and the mind of white america

prime minister benazir bhutto opened a 
sevennation south asia meeting today with a new call to negotiate a 
regional treaty limiting nuclear weapons 
we are prepared for negotiations to prevent proliferation of 
nuclear weapons in our region on a nondiscriminatory basis ms 
bhutto told foreign ministers from india and six other nations of 
the south asian association for regional cooperation 
pakistan is widely reported to have developed nuclear weapons 
capability despite denials by ms bhuttos government india 
exploded what it termed a peaceful nuclear device in 1974 
ms bhuttos latest proposal came at the start of a twoday 
meeting which is meant to set the stage for a december summit of the 
associations leaders probably in colombo sri lanka other members 
are bangladesh nepal bhutan and the maldives 
the associations nations represent a combined population of more 
than 1 billion people who earn on average about 150 a year 
the foreign ministers were originally to meet in july but it was 
canceled after a sri lankan boycott to protest indias refusal to 
withdraw more than 50000 of its soldiers from the island nation 
the two countries have since reached an agreement 
pakistan which has fought three unsuccessful wars with 
neighboring india previously has offered to enter into several 
bilateral nonnuclear agreements 
predominantly hindu india and moslem pakistan have tried to thaw 
traditionally cold relations since ms bhuttos leftleaning 
government came to power following elections a year ago 
but prime minister rajiv gandhi of india has refused to discuss 
nonproliferation with pakistan because he claims the military and 
not ms bhuttos civilian government is in charge of the program 
analysts say india has rejected talks mainly because it wants to 
keep its nuclear weapons option open in response to china its rival 
northern neighbor which has been a nuclear power since 1964 
the problems of underdevelopment must not be compounded by 
misgivings and misperceptions ms bhutto told the foreign 
ministers the legacy of mistrust suspicion and genuine security 
concerns need to be overcome 
ms bhutto who is expecting her second child within a month 
said one third of child deaths worldwide occur in pakistan india 
and bangladesh 
the associations charter signed four years ago in bangladesh 
prohibits overtly political initiatives it was organized to 
concentrate on trade cultural health and environmental matters 
the last summit was held in december 1988 in islamabad

gov bob martinez is seeking a nearly 5 
percent cut in spending by all state agencies to help make up a 
projected revenue shortfall of nearly 280 million 
martinez proposed the cuts tuesday in an effort to balance 
floridas 23 billion budget in light of lowerthanexpected tax 
collections 
the governor recommended all state agencies be ordered to reduce 
spending 49 percent for the seven months left in the fiscal year 
he and the cabinet must vote on the proposal and are expected to 
do so thursday the cuts do not require legislative approval 
in addition martinez ordered agencies under his direct authority 
to fill only one of every two vacancies after dec 1 and curtail 
travel and the purchase of supplies 
state economists attributed the shortfall to consumers saving 
more and spending less patricia woodworth the governors budget 
director said also that economists overestimated revenue from sales 
and corporate income taxes

david dinkins a courtly figure in a clamorous 
campaign defeated an aggressive republican prosecutor to become the 
citys first black mayor in what he hailed as a triumph over 
division and suspicion 
we held to the high road and we proved that it is the right 
road to victory dinkins told supporters early today and 
whatever the final margin i like to think that we won a great 
victory against the division and suspicion 
dinkins a 62yearold democrat attracted nearly all of the 
black vote roughly a third of the white vote and jewish vote and 
about 70 percent of the hispanic vote 
ours is a new coalition of conscience and purpose he said 
one that has room for everyone and excludes no one we will search 
city and nation to find the best minds and the best ideas 
with all but six of the citys 5237 precincts reporting the 
unofficial count showed dinkins with 898534 votes or 50 percent 
while rudolph giuliani a former federal prosecutor who ran as a 
reformer had 856448 votes or 48 percent conservative and right 
to life candidates each had 1 percent 
pollsters said latedeciding voters helped close the margin of 
victory compared with the doubledigit lead dinkins maintained in 
opinion polls through last week 
dinkins a background figure for more than 20 years in the state 
assembly and as city clerk and manhattan borough president will 
succeed brash edward i koch whose attempt to become the citys 
first fourterm mayor was derailed in the september primary 
we passed another milestone on freedoms road a victory not 
for african americans alone but for all new yorkers and for all 
americans dinkins said 
new york voters also decided to change the city government 
approving a new charter by 5545 percent 
the us supreme court ruled this year that the citys board of 
estimate which decided most landuse and budget issues was 
unconstitutional because it gave equal power to five boroughs with 
widely varying populations 
a commission wrote up the new charter which got rid of the board 
of estimate increased the size of the city council from 35 to 51 
and gave what some feel is more power to the mayor 
to reach city hall dinkins withstood giulianis relentless 
attack on his competence and integrity and responded with a call 
for unity and tolerance 
we held to the high road and we proved that it is the right 
road to victory dinkins said and whatever the final margin i 
like to think that we won a great victory against the division and 
suspicion 
giuliani hoping to become the first republican mayor since john 
lindsay in 1965 had spent most of the campaign slamming dinkins as 
a clubhouse politician whose sloppy financial dealings bode ill 
for a city that has weathered several corruption scandals the 
strong showing in this democratic stronghold will make the 
45yearold giuliani a force in state republican politics 
in his concession speech giuliani screamed at his supporters to 
stop booing dinkins name urged them to unite behind the 
mayorelect and appeared to keep the door open for another shot at 
gracie mansion 
david dinkins will have a difficult task ahead of him 
giuliani said our city is troubled in deep and serious ways 
every prayer you have ever said for me every assistance you have 
ever given me all the patience and support you have shown to me i 
ask you now to give to our new mayor 
but he later told the crowd you did a miracle 48 percent of 
the vote when republicans are outnumbered 5to1 in this city 
and you did it because we tapped a chord we reached for a 
feeling that exists in this city for reform for a new kind of 
politics we almost made it but were not stopping are we 
in harlem where dinkins grew up joy was evident 
i feel proud said barbara johnson who celebrated in 
dinkins uptown headquarters on 125th street its a reinforcement 
of black pride twelve years of mayor koch was just enough i expect 
less homeless and more racial togetherness those are the two main 
things 
blacks make up a quarter of the citys population but dinkins 
whose campaign themes of unity and tolerance resonated at a time 
when violent racial incidents shook the city pointed to his 
broadbased support and urged that it continue 
what can unite us is far stronger than the forces that can keep 
us apart he said i intend to be the mayor of all the people 
not just for those who voted for me

a justice department official told congress 
today that the president has the power to violate international law 
by ordering the seizure of terrorists or drug traffickers without 
the consent of other nations 
assistant attorney general william p barr who wrote a legal 
opinion giving the fbi authority to make such arrests said such 
violations of international law would be justified to thwart 
terrorist attacks or capture drug dealers harbored by another 
country 
abraham sofaer the state departments chief legal adviser 
endorsed barrs legal reasoning but warned of the dangers of making 
such arrests because all nations need to take into account the 
reactions of other nations to conduct which departs from accepted 
norms 
barr and sofaer told the house judiciary subcommittee on civil 
and constitutional rights that seizing terrorists or drug 
traffickers in violation of international law but in selfdefense 
would be legally justifiable 
in response to an actual or threatened terrorist attack we 
would have good grounds under general principles of international 
law to justify extraterritorial law enforcement actions over a 
foreign sovereigns objections barr said 
in appropriate circumstances we may have a sound basis under 
international law to take action against largescale drug 
traffickers being given safe haven by a government acting in 
complicity with their criminal enterprise he added 
barr and sofaer stressed that the legal opinion did not mean a 
change in government policy that requires cooperation with other 
nations before an arrest on foreign soil is made overseas arrests 
without a foreign governments consent would only be undertaken with 
approval of the president 
it may well be that the president will choose to direct 
extraterritorial arrests only when he believes that he is justified 
in doing so as a matter of selfdefense under international law 
barr said but it is ultimately the presidents judgment as to the 
need for a particular operation that is controlling for purposes of 
domestic law 
sofaer outlined the hazards of pursuing such a policy noting 
danger to us agents overseas and the inevitable adverse impact 
on our bilateral relations with the country in which we act 
we need to consider the fact that our legal position may be 
seized upon by other nations to engage in irresponsible conduct 
against our interests the state department official said 
rep don edwards dcalif the subcommittees chairman noted that 
the iranian parliament has cited the justice department opinion to 
say that they have the same right to come into the united states to 
arrest their fugitives without our knowledge and kidnap them 
the june 21 opinion which the justice department has refused to 
make public states us law authorizes the fbi to snatch fugitives 
in foreign countries that refuse to cooperate in extradition 
proceedings 
it reverses a 1980 department ruling that the fbi lacked us 
legal authority to ignore international law 
justice department spokesman david runkel on tuesday defended the 
agencys refusal to make public the opinion or give it to the 
subcommittee saying it was confidential legal advice given to the 
fbi 
runkel said not even members of congress are entitled to see the 
legal advice the justice department gives other executive branch 
agencies he said why would we treat the committee any 
differently than the news media or the general public 
on tuesday edwards expressed dismay over runkels statement 
saying maybe the department needs more experience it needs an 
education about how the government is supposed to work in a free 
society 
edwards said he hoped the hearing will guide them along that 
path 
justice department officials responding to news accounts of the 
opinion have said it does not represent policy but merely an 
evaluation of the fbis legal authority 
fbi director william s sessions told reporters tuesday the 
opinion was sought because the bureaus jurisdiction has been 
expanded to investigate terrorist acts overseas against americans 
were seeking to be as innovative and as fully responsible to 
congressional intent as we can possibly be sessions said 
but sessions said the fbi wouldnt exercise its legal authority 
to grab fugitives without permission from the highest levels of the 
administration 
we are not now contemplating any particular undertaking that 
would involve that particular capability 
but sessions said he envisioned circumstances when it could be 
used i think that the capability obviously and the approval of 
that kind of operation could be reality

an end to tolls at the exits of the west 
virginia turnpike has been delayed a week so gov gaston caperton 
can close the toll booths with flair 
the legislature voted to eliminate 12 toll booths where 
motorists are charged 25 cents to 75 cents as they get off the 
turnpike saying the booths dont generate enough revenue to make 
them worthwhile 
caperton had scheduled a ceremony for today in charleston to mark 
the occasion but it was moved to tuesday near beckley 
it was rescheduled because the turnpike authority felt beckley 
would be the more appropriate place to conduct the ceremony because 
it is in the central part of the turnpike and serves more people 
caperton spokesman steve cohen said 
cohen said the delay will allow time to gather supporting players 
and props for the ceremony including turnpike workers trucks and 
heavy construction equipment 
the 88mile turnpike was built in the 1950s it runs between 
charleston and princeton and is a main northsouth route between the 
northern midwest and the southeast 
legislators said the exit tolls referred to as nuisance 
tolls bring in only 22 million a year and discourage motorists 
from stopping in west virginia 
four toll booths will remain

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout 
the country 
nov 7 
central maine morning sentinel waterville maine on sovietbloc 
reforms 
the changes wrought on the soviet union under perestroika 
have come so frequently over the past couple of years that theyve 
lost their shock value in the united states 
disarmament proposals from the soviets are routine the public 
return of raoul wallenburgs effects with an apology from the kgb 
was unusual but not startling but last weeks mea culpa from the 
kremlin on afghanistan and the krasnoyarsk radar base was 
astounding 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told the soviet 
legislature that the war in afghanistan was illegal and undertaken 
behind the backs of the soviet people 
shevardnadze said the siberian radar violated the antiballistic 
missile treaty and would be dismantled but that wasnt all 
on the same day hungary marked the anniversary of its 1956 
uprising by declaring itself a republic 
still on the same day 300000 east germans marched through east 
berlin calling for democracy 
perestroika has spread and is spreading but while the news was 
breaking in moscow and east berlin the bush administration 
officials were trying to prove that they were ready with the new 
opportunities for change 
the clearest opportunity to reduce the risk of war since the 
dawn of the nuclear age secretary of state james a baker 3d 
said later adding it would be folly indeed to miss this 
opportunity 
folly indeed the opportunity is so great that to squander it 
would be one of the most grievous mistakes of the nuclear age and 
it could happen sooner than one would think hardline communism is 
lurking in the shadows

the arizona republic phoenix on sovietbloc reforms 
as londons economistput it you dont go bang by stages there 
is something beguiling in the notion of a controlled explosion 
the idea that after 40 years of communist rule eastern europes 
marxist leaders could manage a transition to democracy without 
everything going smash 
in the soviet union mikhail gorbachev has been lured by the same 
siren song thinking he could reform the stagnant russian economy 
incrementally without repudiating the core doctrines of communism 
in both cases it appears that the old soviet bloc may be headed for 
a major crash 
gorbachev has adopted a handsoff policy toward european reform 
apparently on the assumption that change could be controlled in two 
ways 1 communist parties would retain a significant share of 
power and 2 there would be no dismantling of the warsaw pact 
again as the economist notes sensible hungarians wish to avoid 
questioning hungarys membership in the warsaw pact and western 
governments are not eager for them to tempt moscow but the effect 
of democratization in hungary has been that politicians there now 
worry more about the voters than the russians and lots of 
hungarians want hungary to become neutral like austria 
all this change in the most sensitive areas of the soviet empire 
comes as gorbachevs economy approaches chaos and parts of the 
country the striking coal miners in vorkuta for instance are close 
to open rebellion 
gorbachev has tried to reform the economy without jettisoning 
marxismleninism outright that may be impossible it may take an 
honesttogoodness revolution to pull the soviet union out of its 
doldrums

tulsa okla world on east germany 
a million east germans filled the streets of berlin saturday 
nov 4 in a prodemocracy rally that even a year ago would have 
been unthinkable 
the communist governments answer or the soviet unions answer 
would have been tanks and troops the world behind the iron 
curtain is turning upside down 
the communist governments response was the announcement of a 
prospective new law allowing citizens 30 days of unrestricted travel 
in the west 
it is a small gesture but a significant victory nevertheless for 
the german citizens who gathered in berlin to shout freedom 
freedom 
but the voice of freedom has been raised throughout eastern 
europe it can be restrained and muted but no one seriously expects 
it to be totally silenced again 
the people have had a taste of it and it is addictive

the journal new ulm minn on nicaragua 
nicaraguan dictator daniel ortega last week brushed aside a 
19month ceasefire between the sandinista forces in nicaragua and 
the contra rebels 
at a summit meeting of american governments ortega announced 
his government would end the ceasefire due to what he called 
increasing rebel attacks saying the bush administration has 
supported terrorism in nicaragua 
baloney congress long ago put an end to military aid to the 
contras over the objections of those who feel the only thing 
forcing the sandinistas to make any concessions to democracy and 
peace talks was the military threat imposed by congress 
if ortega was truly dedicated to peace and concerned about 
increased contra action the summit would have been a great 
place to complain about it but not to abandon the ceasefire 
we agree with the bush administration that resuming military 
assistance to the contras is too tessentially american 
businesses columbia pictures and rockefeller center havent 
helped matters fears grow daily that a weakened united states is 
ceding its independence to more robust foreign economics 
those fears happily are unwarranted based on an incomplete 
picture of the world economy and americas uniquely strong position 
in it 
it should be understood that foreign investment in the united 
states is much smaller than scare stories would lead us to believe 
foreign groups employ less than 4 percent of the american work force 
and own less than 5 percent of us assets 
the global economy is shaped by forces undreamed of 50 years ago 
billions of dollars can be moved across borders by computer in 
seconds the united states has proved itself a source of both 
stability and innovation amid the lightning changes thats cause 
for pride not alarm

the milwaukee journal on the demise of the los angeles herald 
examiner 
no doubt were more sensitive than others to such things but the 
death of a newspaper is a sad event one occurred last week the los 
angeles herald examiner folded it was once the nations largest 
afternoon paper but later switched to morning publication 
at the age of 86 the herald succumbed to labor problems heavy 
competition from the giant los angeles times and other stresses 
of course the herald was not as good a paper as the times 
together with suburban papers however the herald did provide 
journalistic diversity to the millions who live in the los angeles 
area and it was a challenge to the times even as the end drew 
near the herald was taking the lead in reporting possible financial 
irregularities by mayor tom bradley 
now the times is the areas only metropolitan daily paper life 
will be a little easier and perhaps less interesting for the 
paper newspapers that must compete tend to fight harder to ask 
more questions and dig deeper many times over the last 86 years 
the herald did that kind of a job for its readers

when the working poor become too poor they become a burden on

dallas times herald on a pickup truck parking ban 
in three weeks a judge in illinois will decide whether there are 
federal issues in a local ordinance banning pickup trucks from 
parking anywhere in public view in the community of flossmoor an 
affluent small town south of chicago 
we would like to ask the judge this does he think there were any 
federal issues in the civil war would he like to see a repeat are 
these people in flossmoor ill totally serious would they be 
willing to give us a large break 
the pickup truck why the pickup truck is a thing of beauty on 
the front end its sleek and chromey just like the cars people 
drive in town but on the back end its stout and practical and can 
carry several bales of hay when needed its what america should be 
honest rough ready but with a clean face whenever possible 
and here these people are banning it maligning the pickup truck 
its almost beyond belief the explanation flossmoor citizens give 
for their ban on the public parking of pickups within their 
corporate limits is that pickups are unattractive 
well if thats how its going to be then we can imagine any 
number of bans that might be easy to sell to other communities how 
about a ban on gazebos there are lots of americans who might 
find it painful to suddenly turn a corner or glance up a hill and 
have their vision accosted by one of these big fat froufrou 
monstrosities what about their sensitivities 
a ban on the public parking of pickup trucks is a direct assault 
on the american way of life the constitution the family unit 
agriculture progress history liberty social responsibility and 
pets 
federal issue indeed strike it down we say strike it down now

jury selection began today for the trial 
of a man charged with 27 counts of murder in the nations deadliest 
drunken driving accident the 1988 crash of a wrongway pickup truck 
and a church bus 
larry mahoney 36 who authorities say drank as much as a case of 
beer the day of the crash is charged with 83 counts in all 
including drunken driving assault and wanton endangerment over 
injuries to those who escaped the burning bus 
some 100 prospective jurors arrived today attorneys have said 
selecting a jury could take two to three weeks and the trial itself 
could last two months 
tight security was imposed at the tiny courthouse including a 
metal detector at the courtroom entrance 
we want to do it once and we want to do it right said 
circuit judge charles satterwhite 
assistant attorney general paul richwalsky said he expected most 
of the jury pool to have heard of the case which prompted a 
national debate over school bus safety and renewed attention on 
drunken driving 
mahoney of worthville is accused of driving his truck the wrong 
way on interstate 71 and crashing into a former school bus from the 
radcliff first assembly of god church the bus was returning from an 
outing to an amusement park 
twentyfour members of a youth group and three adults died all 
from smoke inhalation 
my defense will revolve around whether larry mahoney is a 
murderer or whether larry mahoney was involved in a traffic 
manslaughter said defense attorney william summers 
the defense attorney said he planned to ask potential jurors if 
they or someone in their families had been convicted of drunken 
driving to understand that these people are everywhere 
theres thousands and thousands of people each year in this 
commonwealth convicted of dwi summers said 
the defendants bloodalcohol level was 026 percent 90 minutes 
after the accident and a national transportation safety board 
investigator testified during board hearings that at the time of the 
accident it likely would have been 029 percent 
that is nearly three times the states 010 percent threshhold 
for drunken driving and twothirds of a lethal dose of alcohol said 
ntsb investigator john moulden who estimated mahoney would have 
consumed a case 24 cans of beer to reach that level 
mahoney pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in a case 
several years ago 
after the crash mahoney spent several weeks in a hospital and 
was then examined at the kentucky correctional psychiatric center 
he was jailed until october 1988 when his family put together 
enough money and property to post his 540000 bond 
mahoney returned to work at his job at mampt chemicals in 
carrollton and lives with his parents he neither drives nor drinks 
anymore summers said 
the ntsb found mahoneys drunkenness was the probable cause of 
the accident but went on to recommend the oldest 20 percent of the 
nations school bus fleet be taken out of service as unsafe 
the board also recommended stricter standards for fuel tank 
protection emergency exits and the flammability of seat covers on 
school buses

the sandinista government said today it 
will propose a new ceasefire plan that calls for a dismantling of 
the usbacked rebel force 
president daniel ortega outlined a 15point plan that he will 
propose during a meeting with the contras on thursday at the united 
nations in new york 
if the contras dont accept this plan they will be voting for 
war said ortega who last week ended a 19month truce with the 
rebels 
the sandinista proposal urges the united states to divert toward 
the contras demobilization what remains of a 49 million package in 
nonlethal rebel aid the congress authorized in march 
the plan also includes creation of routes within nicaragua for 
the rebels to use to return to honduras where the commission would 
provide certificates for their repatriation or relocation in third 
countries ortega said 
he spoke at a news conference after the nicaraguan delegation 
headed by assistant foreign minister victor hugo tinoco left for 
the talks in new york 
as a concession to us interests ortega offered to suspend 
temporarily nicaraguas weapons imports until next april 25 but 
only after the demobilization accord is signed this seemed an empty 
gesture since the soviet union told the united states earlier this 
year it had suspended weapons shipments to nicaragua 
a general amnesty would be offered once at least 50 percent of 
the contras have demobilized and the rebels free kidnapped people 
they hold he said 
ortega asked for the un meeting to discuss demobilization of 
the contras he proposed it when he announced an end to a 19month 
ceasefire last week 
the contra rebels are to disband and leave their honduran camps 
voluntarily by the first few days of december under an agreement 
signed by honduras nicaragua and three other central american 
governments aug 7 
about 12000 rebels were in neighboring honduran camps aug 7 
ortega said he ended the ceasefire because more than 1100 rebels 
had moved back into nicaragua in recent weeks 
the rebel delegation went to washington on monday to meet with 
us officials rebel sources in tegucigalpa said 
the contras have said they want a resumption of the ceasefire a 
general amnesty and guarantees they can visit nicaragua to verify 
that sufficient reforms have been made to allow their safe return 
rebels and the government last met directly in june 1988 in an 
effort to turn a temporary truce signed in march into a permanent 
peace the effort failed when the government refused to accept 
contra demands among them an end to sandinista control of the army 
and police

americans and soviets have at least one thing 
in common many dont know much geography and show an astonishing 
lack of awareness of the world around them a gallup poll showed 
today 
in the first survey of geographic knowledge conducted in the 
soviet union young soviets scored significantly higher than their 
american counterparts but didnt do well when compared with adults 
of all age groups in the 10 nations where the test was given 
for example soviets between ages 18 and 24 correctly identified 
an average of 93 of 16 locations on a world map ranking fourth 
along with canadians and italians young american adults came in 
last with an average of 69 correct 
overall however soviets as a whole identified an average of 74 
of a possible 16 locations that put them at the bottom with mexico 
american adults ranked only slightly higher with 86 correct swedes 
were at the top with an average of 116 correct 
the survey was commissioned by the national geographic society to 
find how the united states compared with its neighbors and other 
industrialized nations the 16 places on the world map were the 
united states soviet union central america japan canada france 
persian gulf mexico italy sweden united kingdom south africa 
west germany pacific ocean egypt and vietnam 
we believe the results from the survey point to a startling 
superpower comparison said the gallup organization which called 
the international geography survey the largest of its kind 
americans and soviets have demonstrated an astonishing lack of 
awareness of the world around them 
the other overall scores were west germans 112 japan 97 
france 93 canada 92 the united kingdom 85 italy 76 and 
mexico 74 
thirteen percent of soviet adults were unable to correctly 
identify the soviet union on a world map while 14 percent of the 
americans could not correctly identify the united states 
about 1500 soviet adults were surveyed this spring in moscow and 
kursk an industrial city of 425000 people 300 miles south of the 
capital 
nearly 11000 people in canada france italy japan mexico 
sweden the united kingdom the united states and west germany were 
tested in the spring of 1988 and the results were announced last 
year 
geographic society president gilbert grosvenor said the survey 
result reinforces the need to strengthen the teaching of geography 
in american classrooms 
vladimir andreyenkov of the soviet academy of sciences which 
conducted the survey with gallup said it was a shock that the 
overall soviet results fell short of soviet researchers 
expectations 
i didnt believe soviet citizens know so little about 
geography he said i rechecked the data many times the results 
were unbelievable they will have very great repercussions in the 
soviet union 
neil upmeyer a gallup vice president attributed the poor 
overall ranking of the soviets to low scores among those over 55 
years old who grew up in war times without adequate educational 
opportunities 
nearly 90 percent of the soviets surveyed compared with 47 
percent of the americans said they had taken a course devoted 
entirely to geography 
those surveyed in the 10 nations were interviewed in their homes 
and asked to locate the same 13 countries central america the 
pacific ocean and the persian gulf on an unmarked world map the 
soviets also were asked to locate afghanistan which borders it to 
the south 
despite heavy soviet involvement in afghanistan during the past 
decade only four people in 10 could find it on the world map 
only about a third of the americans and soviets located vietnam 
and only about 25 percent in each country picked out the persian 
gulf about 40 percent of the soviets did not recognize the pacific 
ocean confusing it with the atlantic or indian ocean

the communist party has a monopoly on power in east 
germany although four small parties are tolerated to give the 
system a semblance of a democracy 
the four block parties until now have been allied with the 
communists and have closely followed communist policies in return 
for holding a few relatively insignificant posts in recent days 
three parties have urged the party to implement reforms 
the communist partys leading role in east german society is 
guaranteed in the countrys constitution 
the politburo the nations top decisionmaking body was 
streamlined wednesday from 21 to 11 members with four new 
reformminded members elected to the body and seven members 
surviving from the old one 
the partys general secretary egon krenz is the most powerful 
man in east germany he is also head of state and chief of the 
national defense council commander in chief of the armed forces 
in theory the highest organ of the communist party is the party 
congress which usually meets every five years the congress elects 
a central committee currently at 163 members to act for it 
between sessions 
the central committee approves the politburo which runs the 
country between central committee meetings in practice the 
politburo usually makes all major decisions 
the party also controls the the 500member peoples chamber or 
parliament which acts as a rubberstamp body that approves party 
decisions the parliament also chooses the council of ministers or 
the government 
the government usually includes some politburo members who run 
key ministries such as defense and security 
the party has cells in the army and factories which 
effectively ensure the partys control and supervision of the 
society and economy it also runs a workers militia a paramilitary 
force 
the parliament is elected by popular vote but is limited to 
single candidates proposed and approved by the party opposition 
leaders say the elections are rigged to ensure the election of party 
candidates

deputies tired of slogging out to the 
middle of a swamp to destroy marijuana plants decided to end the 
problem by blowing up the field 
attacking the problem by getting rid of the dirt instead of what 
grows in it sheriffs investigators tuesday blew up some 20 dirt 
mounds where 2000 pot plants had been destroyed in three raids over 
the past year 
there was no marijuana planted there when bomb experts rigged 
about 20 charges and blew the mounds along with trees weeds foul 
water and almost certainly a considerable number of confused snakes 
into the afternoon sky 
maj james foy said as much as 100000 in marijuana could be 
harvested in a single crop from the mounds 
no one has ever been arrested in the raids and investigators 
said it was only a matter of time before someone again took 
advantage of the isolated site

the nations roman catholic bishops voted 
overwhelmingly to let laymen and nuns conduct sunday worship 
services in isolated communities that lack priests 
communities in such states as alaska texas wyoming are expected 
to be affected by the proposal which was approved late tuesday 
22518 in a tally announced this morning the measure still must be 
approved by the vatican 
bishop joseph p delaney of fort worth chairman of the committee 
on liturgy said a survey showed 51 dioceses with severe clergy 
shortages already have sunday celebrations without a priest 
parishes in alaska have had priestless celebrations for 12 years 
said bishop michael h kenny of juneau 
delaney said the measure will provide uniform guidelines for 
worship services in areas where a priest is unavailable 
but retired bishop william e mcmanus of the diocese of fort 
waynesouth bend in indiana charged that approval of the rite will 
bless a monster that could destroy the sunday mass tradition 
at worship services laymen will be allowed to distribute 
communion wafers that were consecrated by a priest such services 
are not masses because the consecration does not take place during 
the celebration mass must still be led by a priest 
the national conference of catholic bishops today put off until 
tomorrow another controversial issue a proposed statement on aids 
seeking to drop the conferences earlier qualified support for 
condom education in public schools 
the statement urges that youngsters be taught chastity instead 
the bishops also unanimously approved a statement declaring that 
the worlds system of producing and distributing food is adrift 
without a moral compass it calls for the united states to change 
tax policies to promote farm ownership and seek to reduce reliance 
on commercial fertilizers and pesticides 
the bishops said the growing concentration of farm land in a few 
corporate hands threatens the common good we have to return the 
means of production to the greatest number of people possible 
said bishop thomas j connolly of baker ore 
on tuesday the bishops approved a policy statement declaring 
that no catholic can responsibly take a prochoice stand and 
made a special plea to catholic public officials to pursue 
legislation limiting abortion 
archbishop roger mahony of los angeles said the church was nearly 
alone in its stance 
we may be the only major population segment in our country the 
only nationwide institution so fully committed to protect and 
defend the rights of the unborn we may be in reality the only moral 
conscience in our country willing to be proclaimed publicly he 
said 
on the abortion issue a catholic abortionrights activist 
accused the prelates of being a political bully and predicted 
their position will come to no avail 
this is a political war they cannot win said frances 
kissling executive director of catholics for a free choice in 
washington 
the bishops renewed activism on abortion follows a us supreme 
court ruling in a missouri case giving states broader authority to 
regulate abortion they said abortion is an issue of overriding 
concern to catholics the nations largest religious denomination 
no catholic can responsibly take a prochoice stand when the 
choice in question involves the taking of innocent human life 
the bishops said 
the bishops also elected archbishop daniel pilarczyk of 
cincinnati a moderate to a threeyear term as president of the 
bishops conference the 55yearold pilarczyk who had been 
conference vice president since 1986 
archbishop william keeler of baltimore past chairman of the 
bishops ecumenical and interreligious affairs committee was 
elected vice president 
cardinal john oconnor of new york was elected to succeed 
cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago as chairman of the bishops

east german leader egon krenz ousted the ruling 
politburo today and replaced its aging members with reformers in a 
dramatic bid to gain control of a country convulsed by protests and 
the exodus of thousands of its people 
the action followed tuesdays resignation of the entire cabinet 
and another round of street demonstrations involving more than 
100000 people in four cities who demanded the right to choose their 
own government 
east germans skeptical about the governments promises of reforms 
continued to flee their homeland today with more than 50000 people 
reaching west germany since saturday 
the entire 21member politburo resigned in a major leadership 
reshuffle which opposition leaders and party members alike had been 
urging for days it was krenzs boldest move to get a grip on power 
since he became leader last month 
the partys 163member central committee then reaffirmed krenz as 
party leader and voted in four new members to the politburo 
including dresden party chief hans modrow who have backed 
sovietstyle reforms 
krenz and six other members who support his reforms were 
reelected to the ruling body 
modrow also was nominated for the post of premier the staterun 
news agency adn said the politburo is the countrys most powerful 
decisionmaking body the central committee approves leadership and 
major policy changes 
our country is going through a tense and extremely difficult 
development krenz said in a speech to the central committee he 
indicated that independent noncommunist groups would be allowed a 
greater role in society 
meanwhile adn said that provincial authorities in several cities 
were beginning to legally register new forum the largest proreform 
group 
later today krenz addressed a crowd of several thousand people 
mostly party faithful in front of the communist party 
headquarters we want a socialism that is politically democratic 
and morally clean he said 
in washington deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk 
said the bush administration hoped the dramatic change in the 
politburos makeup is a step on the road to stable and 
evolutionary reform 
todays action reduces the number of politburo members from 21 to 
11 in addition to krenz and modrow the central committee 
reelected to a politburo seat guenter schabowski who has also 
become a leading reform advocate 
the central committee also voted to appoint johannes chemnitzer 
as a nonvoting member of the politburo chemnitzer was the first 
highranking east german politician to suggest discussing the need 
for the berlin wall 
in a brief dispatch the official adn news agency said krenz 
suggested the politburo resign so that the responsibility for 
the current situation cn be made clear 
many members of the outgoing politburo are in their 60s and 70s 
and are closely associated with krenzs mentor former hardline 
leader erich honecker the aging leadership had increasingly lost 
credibility especially in the face of massive defections to the 
west 
krenz in office just three weeks faces great difficulties as he 
tries to assert authority in a country that exploded in unrest a 
month ago as it marked the 40th anniversary of its founding as a 
communist state 
krenz has indicated no intention of releasing the communists 
grip on power he is under growing pressure at home and abroad to 
follow the lead of discredited communist rulers in poland and 
hungary and share power 
before the politburo action chancellor helmut kohl of west 
germany urged east german communists to surrender their monopoly on 
power approve free elections and clear the way for economic reforms 
with this condition i am also ready to discuss a new dimension 
in our economic aid kohl told parliament in bonn west germany 
has several times offered east berlin substantial new financial aid 
if wideranging reforms are embraced 
on tuesday more than 100000 people rallied in at least four 
east german cities after the resignation of the cabinet a 44member 
body that has little power and implements policy made by the 
politburo 
about 5000 east berliners marched past the party building to 
demand free elections and shouted egon we are the competitors 
and we are the people the few police outside the party building 
did not intervene 
border officials in west germany said the number of refugees 
reaching bavaria by way of czechoslovakia since saturday when free 
exit through that country was first permitted had reached more than 
50000 
czechoslovakia is the only country to which east germans can 
travel freely 
the escape route opened saturday created the first free passage 
to the west since the berlin wall went up in 1961 authorities have 
said the route will remain open until a new travel law takes effect 
possibly before christmas 
so far this year more than 190000 east germans more than 1 
percent of the population of 166 million have moved to west 
germany by emigrating legally escaping or failing to return from 
approved trips abroad 
west germany gives them automatic citizenship and help in 
starting new lives

a judge who told a divorcee she couldnt 
live with her boyfriend and keep her child is out of touch with the 
times observed a state supreme court justice who said the case 
reminded her of harper valley pta 
two high court justices on a panel considering an appeal by the 
mother noted tuesday that its rare these days for custody disputes 
to be settled on the basis of alleged misconduct by a spouse after a 
divorce 
the mother judith roush asked the court to overturn an order by 
kanawha county judge john hey who gave her 30 days to marry her 
boyfriend move out of his house or give up custody of her 
14yearold daughter melissa 
hay issued the order aug 23 order at the request of mrs roushs 
former husband rodney dell roush they were divorced in january 
1988 
at the supreme court hearing justice margaret workman said 
repeated court decisions have rejected the notion that cohabitation 
is grounds for removing a child from a parents custody 
it reminds me of harper valley pta workman said 
recalling the hit 1968 ballad of smalltown moralizing 
justice richard neely said the notion of defining postmarital 
misconduct is impossible in modern society 
how do you define misconduct neely said nobody in the 
world agrees on misconduct 
the appeal said hey rejected the recommendation of a court 
official known as a family law master because mrs roush and her 
daughter live with robert cain though he and mrs roush arent 
married the family law master recommended that the girl stay with 
her mother 
attorney larry l skeen who represented hey at the hearing 
noted theres a state law against lewd and lacivious 
cohabitation if the laws of the state on morality are outdated 
the state supreme court should just say they are 
can you imagine any jury in west virginia convicting someone 
for cohabitating neely asked 
youd have to pick your jury carefully skeen said to an 
outburst of laughter 
the supreme court did not immediately rule 
mrs roushs petition said she earns 80100 a week in net 
income and cannot afford to maintain an apartment of her own the 
suit said 
hey was out of his office tuesday and could not be reached for

president bushs nomination of his cousin john 
m walker as an appeals court judge is coming under fire from a 
prominent legal scholar as a violation of the law against nepotism 
in government 
he would not have gotten this nomination if he were not the 
presidents cousin harvard law professor alan m dershowitz said 
tuesday at a senate judiciary committee hearing 
walker 48 currently a us district court judge in new york 
drew no critics other than dershowitz at the hearing the committee 
is not expected to vote on whether to recommend the nomination to 
the full senate for several weeks a customary delay 
dershowitz told the panel that walker got this appointment 
because of family connections and that it violates the 
antinepotism statute both in language and in spirit 
white house deputy press secretary roman popadiuk said today 
no law is being broken period he said walker had received the 
american bar associations highest rating 
under the 1976 law federal officials may not name relatives to 
government jobs dershowitz said he thinks the statute covers the 
walker nomination but later told reporters there was room for 
disagreement on that point 
he told the committee that even if the law does not apply to 
judicial nominations the walker nomination violates the spirit of 
the law 
walker elegantly dressed and bearing a slight resemblance to his 
cousin sat a few feet away as dershowitz described him as an 
average rather than a distinguished judge once he shook his 
head impatiently 
judge walkers name would not have appeared on the long list or 
the short list if bush had polled the new york bar to find a 
candidate for the post dershowitz said 
it shouldnt be enough that he is minimally qualified he 
said 
dershowitz also said that walker once held an improper discussion 
with an attorney in a court matter growing out of the 
attemptedmurder trial of socialite claus von bulow who was 
subsequently acquitted walker denied the allegation

gov mike hayden today proposed curbs on 
lateterm abortions and called for a requirement that girls under 16 
notify at least one parent before terminating a pregnancy 
the proposed changes in kansas relatively liberal abortion law 
do not go nearly as far as those expected to be offered by 
antiabortion activists after the legislature convenes jan 8 
kansas law bans the use of public funds for abortions but 
otherwise allows abortion virtually on demand 
haydens republican administration has been developing a position 
on the issue since the us supreme court in july opened the door to 
more restrictive abortion laws the court upheld a missouri law 
banning use of public funds and facilities for most abortions 
floridas legislature last month flatly rejected curbs on 
abortion pushed by gov bob martinez in pennsylvania the state 
house overwhelmingly approved what would be the nations most 
restrictive abortion laws the legislation goes next to the senate 
hayden unveiled his proposals during a speech to the kansas 
public health association in manhattan 
i believe the decision to have an abortion in the first 22 
weeks of pregnancy should be determined by the woman involved and 
her doctor he said 
but he proposed that after 22 weeks a woman not be allowed to get 
an abortion unless her health is at risk the pregnancy is the 
result of rape or incest or the fetus is severely deformed 
as neighboring states come to enact restrictions on lateterm 
abortions we do not want kansas to become an abortion mill for the 
nation hayden said 
antiabortion activists have said they will seek an outright ban 
on lateterm abortions and on all abortions at the university of 
kansas medical center in kansas city kan 
hayden said the state should maintain its ban on the use of 
public funds for abortions but that outlawing all abortions at the 
medical center could have serious consequences particularly for 
preganant women with lifethreatening conditions 
he said parental notification legislation would promote 
communication in families public policy in kansas should support 
families he said in 35 other states parental notification or 
consent laws have been enacted 
pat goodson lobbyist for right to life of kansas inc which 
endorsed hayden during his 1986 campaign harshly criticized the 
proposals 
what hes done is advocate the donothing position of the 
socalled moderate wing of the prochoice movement she said 
house speaker jim braden a republican endorsed haydens stand 
he said i believe the decision whether to have an abortion 
should be made by a woman and her doctor i laud the governor for 
his leadership and courage

mayor andrew young who plans to run for governor 
next year said wednesday that this weeks victories by black 
candidates wont have much bearing on his campaign 
im certainly encouraged by the election of democrats all over 
the country and in particular two good friends of mine young 
said at a news conference referring to david dinkins and l douglas 
wilder 
but other than the fact that we all went to the same college 
howard university and we all happen to have the same skin color 
there isnt really a lot we have in common 
dinkins won election tuesday as new york citys first black 
mayor and wilder claimed a disputed victory in virginias 
gubernatorial race if he is the winner wilder would be the 
nations first black governor 
although he has not yet formally announced as a candidate young 
is expected to enter a crowded race for georgias democratic 
gubernatorial nomination 
young said his political experience like that of dinkins and 
wilder would be an advantage 
i think georgia has come further in race relations than 
virginia he added we have more elected black officials 
if race should become an issue in next years election i think 
it would be rejected by georgians georgians are ready to get that 
chapter behind us

the house ways and means committee expressed 
concern wednesday about the use of us trade sanctions to achieve 
us foreign policy goals saying they work only if many countries 
impose them 
the panel urged president bush to try to persuade other nations 
to impose sanctions in support of the united states and to consider 
ending us sanctions if they do not 
the committee comments came as it endorsed pending legislation 
authorizing the use of trade sanctions against foreign countries and 
companies whose actions lead to the spread or use of chemical or 
biological weapons 
several committees have jurisdiction over the legislation 
endorsed earlier by the house foreign affairs committee 
the house version of the bill requires the president to impose 
sanctions against foreign companies that have substantially 
contributed to another countrys ability to make or use chemical or 
biological weapons 
other sanctions could be imposed against countries obtaining or 
using chemical weapons 
the bill gives the president flexibility in choosing whether to 
impose sanctions and is generally weaker than legislation pending in 
the senate it gives the president authority to waive sanctions if 
he determines that doing so is in the interest of the united states 
the ways and means committee said in a policy statement that 
evidence strongly indicates that sanctions are most effective when 
imposed by many nations 
unilateral sanctions rarely have a significant effect on the 
target country the panel said adding that sanctions imposed by 
the united states alone place an unduly heavy burden on us 
exporters and importers and give an unwarranted advantage to us 
trading partners 
the committee therefore urges the administration if it imposes 
sanctions against a country under authority of this bill to seek 
the timely imposition of substantially similar sanctions by other 
major producers of goods and technology which can be used to make or 
use chemical or biological weapons the panel said

retired air force maj gen richard v secord 
pleaded guilty today to one count of lying to congressional 
investigators in the irancontra scandal 
secord had been scheduled to go on trial next monday on 12 
criminal charges nine of them stemming from his testimony to 
congress in 1987 
but at a pretrial hearing irancontra prosecutor reid 
weingarten announced that the government and secords lawyers had 
negotiated a plea agreement the government will seek dismissal of 
the other 11 criminal charges against secord who also could have 
faced tax charges prosecutors said 
no further criminal charges including criminal tax charges 
will be brought against the defendant based on information now known 
to the office of independent counsel relating to the irancontra 
affair the plea agreement stated 
prosecutors were prepared to present evidence that secord 
personally received in excess of 15 million in profits from 
the sale of weapons to the contras and iran the office of 
independent counsel lawrence walsh said in court papers 
secord agreed to cooperate fully with irancontra prosecutors 
by testifying truthfully at any trial to which he may be 
called according to the plea agreement 
he could become a government witness against former national 
security adviser john m poindexter whose criminal trial is 
scheduled to begin jan 22 poindexter is accused of obstructing 
congress and giving false statements in various investigations 
poindexter has told the judge in his case that his daily meetings 
with thenpresident reagan included discussions of secords role as 
a middleman in the transfer of arms to iran poindexter is trying to 
subpoena reagans notes and diaries 
secord flew with poindexter from central america to the united 
states on april 20 1986 after the two men reviewed problems in 
white house aide oliver norths secret contra resupply network 
when they landed in miami secord and poindexter met with north 
at the offices of southern air a former ciaowned company involved 
in contra resupply according to deposition testimony given to 
congress by one of the participants in the operation 
secord admitted in us district court that he made a false 
statement when he told congressional investigators on june 10 1987 
that he had not been aware any money from his business dealings in 
the irancontra affair went to white house aide oliver north 
secord told judge aubrey robinson that he had paid for a 13800 
security fence at norths home 
i should have known that they were aiming at the fence 
secord said of the question by congressional investigators that led 
to his false statement secord said his answer was a misguided 
effort to prevent further criticism noting that there had 
already been a firestorm in the press about who paid for norths 
security fence 
secord said i was trying to shield both of us when he lied 
about norths fence in his deposition to the congressional 
investigators 
secord could be sentenced to up to five years in prison 
secords profits for his work on the administrations iran arms 
sales and assisting the contras exceed 15 million prosecutors 
said in a recent court filing secord had been called into both 
initiatives by north 
the government presented a document listing the evidence it would 
have presented at secords trial in support of the charge to which 
he pleaded guilty 
the document stated that in addition to secord paying for the 
fence there was an attempted coverup of who paid for the fence 
through the use of backdated documents 
secords attorney thomas green objected to that portion of the 
governments evidence saying secord had not been involved in a 
coverup 
the document also said secord and his business partner albert 
hakim had arranged to set aside 200000 for an insurance fund for 
norths wife for the education of the north children 
the document said secord told north that the money had been set 
aside 
in his congressional testimony in 1987 north testified that he 
knew nothing of the 200000 
secords deal with prosecutors was first reported tuesday night 
by nbctv 
secord was one of the first figures in the irancontra affair to 
cooperate with the congressional investigation he was the leadoff 
witness in televised hearings in the summer of 1987 and testified 
without immunity from prosecution that was granted others including 
north 
hakim and secord were the middlemen in usiran arms sales 
secord an expert in covert operations also helped north then a 
national security council aide set up a secret arms supply network 
to the nicaraguan rebels

thirtyfive years ago silvio 
santos was selling wallets illegally on street corners with a quick 
patter to attract customers and an eye out for the police 
santos a multimillionaire executive and controlling stockholder 
of brazils secondlargest tv network now enthralls millions with 
his antics on camera he also may become the next president of latin 
americas largest country in the nov 15 election 
i dont have any plan said santos 58 shortly after 
declaring his candidacy at the last minute on oct 31 for the 
countrys first direct presidential vote in 29 years but i felt 
the desire of the people 
if the railsplitter abraham lincoln was president of the united 
states and the actor ronald reagan as well and for two terms a 
street vendor who became an entertainer and businessman can be 
president of brazil he was quoted as saying in veja magazine 
brazils largest newsweekly 
the supreme electoral court is expected to rule by friday on 
whether santos wildcard candidacy as a substitute on the 
ticket of the minuscule unknown brazilian municipalist party is 
legal 
a spot poll by the brazilian gallup institute on nov 2 showed 
the popular tv personality leading the other 21 candidates with a 29 
percent voter preference two polls released since then put him in 
second place with 14 percent and 18 percent after centerright 
candidate fernando collor de mello 
on monday collor de mello accused president jose sarney of 
trying to manipulate the election by backing santos both santos and 
sarney who by law cannot run again deny the allegations although 
the president has not endorsed santos he opposes collor de mello a 
former governor who has accused sarney of being corrupt and 
incompetent 
santos born senor abravanel into a greekjewish workingclass 
family in rio said its not my fault if the election fell into 
my hands at this moment 
santos sold odds and ends in downtown rio watching for police 
because he didnt have a vendors license he later got the beer and 
softdrink concession on ferryboats crossing rios guanabara bay and 
entertained commuters over a loudspeaker 
next came stints as a radio announcer and circus performer 
in 1958 in sao paulo brazils biggest city santos took over a 
business through which poor brazilians without credit could buy 
household goods by making monthly payments in coupon books 
the system called the trunk of happiness let people 
exchange coupons for merchandise with it santos turned his oneman 
operation into one of the biggest private conglomerates in latin 
america grupo silvio santos has some 50 companies employing nearly 
20000 people 
to sell more coupon books santos in 1965 bought tv time on 
sunday afternoons and put on his own variety show in which he 
cajoled viewers into signing up for the trunk of happiness 
when santos decided to raffle off houses as special prizes the 
response was so great he set up a construction company to meet the 
demand he later bought an automobile dealership sold auto 
insurance formed a securities investment firm and went into the 
retailing business 
in 1975 he bought his own tv station in 1981 with the backing 
of the military dictatorship that then ruled brazil he became the 
owner of the sbt network 
running for eight hours every sunday the silvio santos 
program is a mixture of game shows and a beauty pageant 
polls show that santos political support comes largely from the 
masses who watch his show and buy his timepayment coupons the 
census bureau says that of 82 million registered voters in a 
population of 150 million only 31 percent have completed eighth 
grade and 75 percent make less than the average salary equal to 36 
a week 
to vote for santos brazilians will have to draw an x through 
the box next to the name of armando correa the municipalist party 
candidate who withdrew to make way for santos 
but first the supreme court must rule whether santos is affected 
by a law that directors of governmentlicensed businesses such as 
tv stations and networks must resign at least three months before 
running in an election 
santoss lawyers said that although he is the main stockholder in 
the sbt network he is not an active director 
jose francsco rezek president of the sevenmember electoral 
court said the tribunal would rule by friday

chancellor helmut kohl on wednesday 
offered badly needed financial support to east germany if the 
nations communist leadership surrenders its 40year monopoly on 
power 
in east berlin the communist partys ruling politburo resigned 
in a major leadership reshuffle brought on by weeks of unprecedented 
unrest and an exodus of thousands of east germans to the west 
kohl in a stateofthenation address delivered to parliament 
warned the communist government in east berlin against trying to 
make do with cosmetic changes 
we are not prepared to support a system that has lost its 
legitimacy kohl said but we are prepared to offer farreaching 
help if genuine and thoroughgoing political and economic reforms 
take root 
kohl urged the communists to relinquish their monopoly on power 
to legalize independent political parties and to allow free 
elections 
under these conditions we are prepared to discuss a new 
dimension in our financial assistance to east germany kohl said 
but kohl made it clear that any such increase in economic aid 
would have to be linked to progress in establishing a more 
marketoriented economy 
without a dismantling of a centrally planned and bureaucratic 
economy and the creation of a marketoriented economy our help will 
be in vain kohl said 
kohl said it was west germanys national task to promote 
political and economic change in east germany 
west germany already pays out millions of dollars in financial 
aid to east germany including transit subsidies and special 
economic credits 
new communist leader egon krenz was reaffirmed in his post and 
several prominent reformers were named to the powerful body krenz 
has promised to introduce wideranging political and economic 
reforms but the pledge has so far not ended widespread street 
protests and the westward flight of his people 
referring to the mass exodus whose latest surge has brought 
50000 to west germany via the czechoslovak border since saturday 
kohl said 
these refugees are voting with their feet against a system that 
has denied them their basic rights and freedoms 
kohl said the dramatic developments in east germany have showed 
the world that the division of our land is unnatural 
the berlin wall and the barbed wire cannot stand forever 
he said these events have made it clear before the eyes of the 
world that the german question is still to be solved because the 
people cannot accept the present division

the president may order us agents to arrest 
terrorists and drug traffickers overseas without a foreign nations 
consent even if it violates international law a justice department 
official said wednesday 
at a congressional hearing assistant attorney general william p 
barr defended his june 21 opinion that the fbi has the legal 
authority in certain circumstances to go into foreign countries and 
arrest fugitives without a host governments permission 
the state departments chief legal adviser abraham d sofaer 
supported barrs legal reasoning but outlined several dangers that 
the united states could face by engaging in conduct which departs 
from accepted norms 
his comments reflected what one lawmaker termed obvious 
differences between the state and justice departments over the 
ruling 
barr and sofaer both said the legal ruling about fbi arrest 
authority did not signal any change in the justice department of 
administration policy respecting foreign sovereignty 
but the two officials outlined circumstances under which the 
fbis legal authority might be used to seize terrorists or drug 
traffickers who pose a serious threat to the security of american 
citizens 
the bottom line is if we find a terrorist for example who 
blows an american 747 out of the sky if we find him basking in some 
safe haven enjoying the payoff of his operation the issue is 
whether we have the authority under our law to go in an arrest 
him barr told the house judiciary subcommittee on civil and 
constitutional rights 
in response to an actual or threatened terrorist attack we 
would have good grounds under general principles of international 
law to justify extraterritorial law enforcement actions over a 
foreign sovereigns objections barr told the panels chairman 
rep don edwards dcalif 
the president may decide to arrest largescale drug traffickers 
being given safe haven by a government acting in complicity with 
their criminal enterprise barr said 
edwards said he couldnt understand why such a very radical 
program was proposed when the number of domestic terrorist 
incidents this year and last were infinitesimal 
im sure the families of the people on pan am 103 will be glad 
to know that the incidents in the united states were 
infinitesimal barr replied referring to the terrorist bombing 
last december of a usbound pan am jetliner that killed 259 people 
over scotland 
edwards charged that the legal authority asserted by barrs 
opinion would tarnish americas reputation as the beacon of 
democracy 
barr cited numerous court cases supporting the proposition that 
the united states could violate international law to assert its 
sovereignty as long as there was no specific ban in american law 
it may well be that the president will choose to direct 
extraterritorial arrests only when he believes that he is justified 
in doing so as a matter of selfdefense under international law 
barr said 
sofaer meanwhile endorsed the idea that international law could 
be breached in selfdefense to protect americans from terrorists or 
drug traffickers who engage in terrorism 
an act of selfdefense is a justified act under international 
law and the united nations charter sofaer said 
but sofaer who has previously testified against legislation that 
would have given the fbi the authority outlined in barrs opinion 
warned of the political consequences of the ruling 
we need to consider the fact that our legal position may be 
seized upon by other nations to engage in irresponsible conduct 
against our interests he said 
edwards noted that the iranian parliament has cited the justice 
department opinion to say that they have the same right to come into 
the united states to arrest their fugitives without our knowledge 
and kidnap them

a car bomb exploded in moslem west beirut 
an hour before the arrival wednesday of rene mouawad lebanons new 
christian president police said four people were killed and 19 
wounded 
a red volvo exploded in the caracas neighborhood three blocks 
from a villa put at mouawads disposal by rafiq hariri a lebanese 
businessman living in saudi arabia police said 
gen michel aoun the christian army commander occupies the 
shellpocked presidential palace in baabda a christian suburb he 
opposed parliaments election of mouawad who is supported by aouns 
syrian enemies and refuses to vacate the palace 
police said the dead included a boy a 37yearold woman and a 
vegetable vendor they said the wounded included three members of 
one family and a 70yearold man 
the explosion shattered windows in the area and set least 10 cars 
ablaze in a parking lot 500 yards from a syrian army checkpoint 
syrian soldiers fired shots into the air to clear the way for 
ambulances and fire engines 
residents ran to the parking lot hoping to save their cars 
a young man sped out of the lot in a black car covered with 
shards of glass and hit a boy in the street rescuers put the boy in 
an ambulance 
an ambulance with a loudspeaker drove through the streets urging 
people to donate blood 
no group claimed responsibility for the seventh car bombing in 
lebanon this year thirty people were killed and 225 wounded in the 
previous six by police count 
mouawad arrived from syriancontrolled north lebanon in a middle 
east airlines plane that landed an hour after the bombing he was 
taken to an apartment building hariri owns at at ramlet baida far 
from the explosion site 
his route was kept secret syrian troops and lebanese riot 
policemen sealed the area around sevenstory apartment building 
mouawad 64 was elected sunday in north lebanon parliament 
moved its session to syriancontrolled territory because aoun 
threatened to shell the parliament building in beirut 
aoun says the 40000 soldiers syria keeps in lebanon under a 
1976 peacekeeping mandate from the arab league are an occupation 
army and has declared a war of liberation to drive them out 
a sixmonth artillery battle between his forces and the syrians 
killed hundreds of people and wounded thousands before a ceasefire 
stopped it in september 
sources said mouawad would announce formation of a national 
reconciliation government by the end of the week in hopes of ending 
the 14yearold sectarian civil war which has cost more than 
150000 lives 
george hawi head of the syrianbacked lebanese communist party 
threatened to kill aoun for rejecting mouawad 
hawi was quoted by the party newspaper annida as saying his 
militia had other fighters like soha bishara who attempted last 
year to kill former army maj antoine lahd commander of a south 
lebanon militia allied with israel lahd was wounded and treated in 
israel 
aoun and acting prime minister salim hoss have led competing 
christian and moslem governments since september 1988 when 
president amin gemayels sixyear term ended with parliament unable 
to agree on a successor 
the general declared parliament dissolved on saturday and claims 
it met illegally sunday to elect mouawad and approve a peace plan 
negotiated in taif saudi arabia 
he has said he will continue to control the 310squaremile 
christian enclave north and east of beirut with the 20000 soldiers 
he commands but how many troopers will stick with him in a 
confrontation with mouawad is uncertain

a former judge accused of 
escaping from a federal prison turned himself in saying he thought 
he had been released 
paul ottinger 74 surrendered in his hometown of hagerstown 
md on tuesday he said he had heard on the radio that he was 
wanted for escape said sheriff charles mades of washington county 
md 
he thought hed been released from federal prison mades 
said it was his understanding he had four days to find his way 
back to hagerstown 
ottinger was to be paroled friday the day he disappeared from 
the unfenced minimumsecurity prison here where he was serving a 
sixmonth term for mail fraud and was then supposed to be 
transferred to maryland to serve a state sentence 
he was a judge from 1971 to 1977 and then returned to private 
practice he was convicted of lying on financial statements to 
banks forging checks and insurance papers and stealing thousands of 
dollars from the estates of dead people 
ottinger had a good chance of being been paroled from state 
prison in a month or two but now may face up to five more years if 
convicted of escape officials said 
the inmate told mades he spent the weekend with friends in 
mobile ala and then flew to hagerstown and went immediately by 
taxi to the sheriffs office 
mike earp an investigator with the us marshals office which 
was looking for the judge said he didnt believe ottingers story 
theres no doubt in my mind he knew what he was doing earp 
said 
earp said it will be up to the us attorneys office to decide 
whether to bring escape charges 
ottinger once said he didnt want to serve time in state prison 
because he was afraid that inmates he had sentenced would try to 
kill him

an antiabortion prosecutor worried that state 
officials may back down and settle a major abortionrights case 
before it goes to the us supreme court lost a bid today to take 
part in the negotiations 
us district judge john a nordberg rejected a request from 
madison county states attorney william r haine to replace the cook 
county states attorney as illinois representative in the case the 
judge said he saw no reason to make such a change 
the abortion case if decided by the high court could open the 
door to more restrictive laws across the country but a settlement 
would prevent such an outcome 
the case involves a challenge by a clinic owner dr richard 
ragsdale to an illinois regulation that he says requires him to 
build the equivalent of a small hospital to do abortions he 
contends the regulation is a veiled attempt to restrict access to 
abortions 
the american civil liberties union and the state are scheduled to 
argue the case dec 5 before the supreme court but have been talking 
in recent weeks in an effort to settle the case 
haines lawyer james bopp jr general counsel to the national 
right to life committee told the new york times it is widely 
believed the supreme court will uphold the illinois law and that the 
state is giving up the fight at the doorstep of victory 
it is one of three cases that the high court has agreed to hear 
this term that could have farreaching effects on abortion rights

young soviets know more geography than young 
americans but citizens of both superpower nations do poorly at 
pinpointing the countries of the world a gallup poll showed 
wednesday 
in todays world if you dont know where you are you are 
nowhere and clearly a lot of people are nowhere said gilbert 
grosvenor president of the national geographic society 
the gallup organization poll commissioned by the national 
geographic society was the first survey of geographic knowledge 
conducted in the soviet union the survey found 
soviets between ages 18 and 24 correctly identified 93 places 
of a possible 16 on a world map that score was the same as for 
young people surveyed in japan canada italy and france but below 
the west germans and swedes the american average was 69 the 
lowest among all nations surveyed 
soviets as a whole identified an average of 74 places or bodies 
of water of a possible 16 on a world map as did mexicans surveyed 
residents of sweden topped the list with 116 correct west germany 
112 japan 97 france 93 canada 92 united states 86 united 
kingdom 85 and italy 76 
thirteen percent of soviet adults were unable to correctly 
identify the soviet union on a world map while 14 percent of the 
americans could not correctly identify the united states 
americans and soviets have demonstrated an astonishing lack of 
awareness of the world around them grosvenor said adding the 
result reinforces the need to strengthen the teaching of geography 
in american classrooms 
vladimir andreyenkov of the soviet academy of sciences which 
conducted the survey with gallup said it was a shock that the 
overall soviet results fell short of soviet researchers 
expectations 
i didnt believe soviet citizens know so little about 
geography he said i rechecked the data many times the results 
were unbelievable they will have very great repercussions in the 
soviet union 
neil upmeyer a gallup vice president attributed the poor 
overall ranking of the soviets to low scores among those over 55 who 
grew up during world war ii without adequate educational 
opportunities 
about 1500 soviet adults were surveyed in their homes last 
spring in moscow and kursk an industrial city of 425000 people 300 
miles south of the capital 
respondents were asked to locate 16 places on the world map the 
united states soviet union central america japan canada france 
persian gulf mexico italy sweden united kingdom south africa 
west germany pacific ocean egypt and vietnam 
the soviets also were asked to locate afghanistan which borders 
it to the south 
nearly 11000 people in canada france italy japan mexico 
sweden the united kingdom the united states and west germany were 
tested in spring 1988 and the results were announced last year 
nearly 90 percent of the soviets surveyed compared with 47 
percent of the americans said they had taken a course devoted 
entirely to geography 
only about a third of the americans and soviets located vietnam 
and only about 25 percent in each country pinpointed the persian 
gulf about 40 percent of the soviets didnt recognize the pacific 
ocean confusing it with the atlantic or indian ocean 
after the soviet union the united states was the next most 
recognized country among the soviets surveyed sixtysix percent of 
soviets correctly located the united states threequarters of the 
americans recognized the soviet union but fewer than half could 
find japan 
west germany was identified by only about 40 percent of the 
soviets and 30 percent of the americans surveyed however 94 
percent of the west germans identified the soviet union compared 
with 88 percent identifying their own country

federal savings and loan regulator m danny wall 
warned industry executives wednesday that an arranged marriage 
with a merger partner might be the only way to prevent a weak 
institution from closing 
thrifts that are undercapitalized are in very grave jeopardy 
understand that wall told 3600 delegates at the 97th annual 
convention of the us league of saving institutions the industrys 
largest trade group 
wall director of the office of thrift supervision was the 
closing speaker at the fourday meeting the first major gathering 
of sampl executives since the aug 9 enactment of thrift bailout 
legislation 
in his speech wall didnt mention the controversy swirling 
around his agencys handling of the failure of lincoln savings and 
loan association of irvine calif expected to cost taxpayers as 
much as 2 billion 
however at a news conference he defended his decision to delay 
seizure of lincoln by nearly two years saying he was legally 
required to keep it open unless it was insolvent the staff of the 
house banking committee contends that wall needed to determine only 
that lincoln was operating unsafely and dissipating its assets 
we were advised at the time we did not have the legal basis 
to seize lincoln it was the best advice we could find he said 
on monday walls agency issued new regulations requiring sampl 
owners to back their lending with more of their own capital 
the rules required under the sampl bill are designed to provide a 
larger buffer of private money between sampl losses and government 
deposit insurance funds 
the thrift office estimates that about 800 of the nations 2600 
solvent sampls will fall nearly 20 billion short of the new standard 
regulators have identified 223 of those sampls as likely candidates 
for government takeover many of the others will be able to meet the 
requirements by shrinking their balance sheets or retaining profits 
wall said 
the rest about 300 must consider a merger or the reality of 
being acquired wall said warning weak thrifts not to be too 
choosy about suitors 
thrifts not meeting capital standards by the end of 1994 face 
closure in the meantime the thrift office will launch a vigorous 
matchmaker program starting with a national conference next 
week to help weak sampls merge with stonger partners without 
government assistance 
we are calling this our arranged marriage program wall said 
citing recent interest by canadian and japanese companies as 
evidence of the thrift industrys positive outlook 
the worst is really over he said we have been through the 
fire and emerged tempered by the experience 
meanwhile the new chairman of the league said wednesday that the 
sampl legislation may too narrowly limit thrift institutions to 
housing loans 
while i consider myself first a housing lender i also want to 
help meet other community lending needs and i fear that the sampl 
bill will restrict my ability to fulfill that role said chairman 
kenneth d seaton 
during congressional debate on the bill the trade association 
lobbied for the preservation of its business by arguing that the 
united states needs a separate mortgage finance system as a result 
congress adopted a provision that will require thrifts by july 1991 
to devote 70 percent of their assets to home financing up from 60 
percent currently 
industry critics charge sampls got in trouble in part because they 
left their traditional business and risked depositors money on 
speculative commercial real estate projects and other types of 
ventures they werent familiar with

of young people for his guitar playing with the yardbirds

had quit performing because he felt it was time for a break 
i was also disgusted with the general musical situation in 
which the whole world seemed to revolve around mtv and highpressure 
music people 
but three years ago he said i attended this festival of 
musical equipment and found myself in my booth surrounded by 2000 
youngsters most of them under 20 they were all knowledgeable and 
knew my yardbirds stuff 
he said he then had to wait until drummer terry bozzio was free 
to join him in a trio with tony hymas on keyboards

l douglas wilder of virginia celebrated a razorthin 
breakthrough as the nations first elected black governor today but 
his republican opponent declared his intention to seek a recount of 
the vote david dinkins was elected new york citys first black 
mayor and said voters had responded with the voice of hope here 
and in virginia 
republican j marshall coleman called a news conference to 
announce that if the official tally in virginia shows the candidates 
separated by less than one half of one percent of the vote a 
certainty based on unofficial figures it is my intention to ask 
for a recount 
let me first say that i congratulate doug wilder on a 
hardfought campaign and if he is certified the winner he will have 
my full support coleman told reporters at his northern virginia 
campaign headquarters 
he said for the good of the new governor it is necessary that 
the public have complete confidence in the results 
coleman said he expected the official vote tally to be available 
in five days 
the unofficial count showed the two candidates separated by 5200 
votes out of a total of 178 million cast 
wilder credited the volatile politics of abortion with being a 
major factor in his victory and dismissed suggestions that race was 
a factor in the narrowness of his margin a plurality still 
questioned by his republican opponent 
im saying it race is not and was not a factor in the results 
because i was elected wilder told a morningafter news conference 
in richmond va nonetheless wilder ran well behind the other two 
democratic candidates for statewide office 
the turnout of prochoice voters powered an election day 
nightmare for republicans that extended to new jersey where 
democratic rep james florio reclaimed the governorship for his 
party and the democrats regained control of the assembly 
its a very tough day for republicans said rep newt 
gingrich the republican house whip 
wait til next year president bush said when asked by 
reporters about the election results as he met with republican 
congressional leaders 
as significant as the shift in abortionvoting sentiment was the 
extension of black political success in americas large city halls 
led by dinkins blacks also succeeded white mayors in seattle 
cleveland new haven conn and durham nc 
its a good day for americans gingrich told cbs when 
young blacks and other folks all over the country can look at a 
mayor dinkins a gov wilder and say there is a future in america if 
you work hard and learn your trade 
the main event of the day was in virginia where republican j 
marshall coleman trailed wilder by 7700 votes of more than 17 
million cast in the unofficial final vote count with all precincts 
counted wilder had 889869 votes or 50 percent and coleman had 
882137 votes or 50 percent 
wilder claimed victory telling jubilant supporters in the 
capital of the old confederacy the people of virginia have 
spoken coleman did not concede saying the race is not yet 
over and he would await a final official count 
wilder said the race was particularily close because of a high 
turnout in virginia and told abc notwithstanding that turnout i 
still emerged with the majority of votes im tickled pink 
he called his election an excellent testimony to the people of 
virginia to the people of this nation as to how far weve come in 
a very short time 
both the virginia and new york races were far closer than 
preelection polls had indicated in keeping with previous campaigns 
in which black politicians drew fewer votes than predicted by 
traditional polling methods 
dinkins like wilder waged a softspoken campaign that dwelled 
not at all on race he replaces the often acerbic ed koch and will 
surely bring a new style of leadership to gracie mansion 
this year voters rejected the calls of fear and voted with the 
voice of hope here and in virginia dinkins said in victory we 
passed another milestone on freedoms road 
with 99 percent of precincts counted dinkins had 898534 votes 
or 50 percent giuliani had 856448 votes or 48 percent and two 
minor party candidates divided the remainder 
republican party chairman lee atwater offered the opposition a 
grudging tip of his hat 
these were local contests in which the democrats outcampaigned 
us and ran better campaigns said atwater my hats off to them 
but i dont think it makes much difference at all with regards to 
the 1990 campaign 
democratic party chairman ronald h brown saw things differently 
he called the results a tremendously positive sign for us as we 
move into the 90s it gives us tremendous momentum heading into 
1990 when 36 governorships 34 senate seats and all 435 seats in 
the house are at stake 
a sweep of the governors races in virginia and new jersey would 
give the democrats 29 of the 50 governorships 
the contest to fill the us house seat made vacant by the death 
of rep mickey leland dtexas in a plane crash in ethiopia last 
summer was headed for a runoff between two democrats state sen 
craig washington and houston city councilman anthony hall 
most of tuesdays action was in the nations cities 
coleman young 71 won an unprecedented fifth term as mayor of 
detroit defeating 40yearold tom barrow other mayors reelected 
included xavier suarez of miami who won a third term and kathy 
whitmire who coasted to a fifth in houston 
democrat john daniels was elected mayor of new haven becoming 
the first black mayor of his majoritywhite city while in seattle 
city councilman norm rice defeated busing foe doug jewett to gain a 
similar distinction 
ohio state sen michael r white defeated his old mentor city 
council president george forbes in a bitter contest between two 
black democrats to succeed retiring republican mayor george 
voinovich 
the nasty tone in cleveland was all too typical of the years 
campaigns 
giuliani a 45yearold former us attorney was unrelenting in 
his attacks on dinkins calling the manhattan borough president 
unfit for the office of mayor but once the outcome was 
determined giuliani called on new yorkers to unite behind the new 
mayor with every prayer 
in new jersey florio trounced republican rep james courter to 
win a governorship held by republican thomas kean the past eight 
years courter never recovered from criticism suffered when he tried 
to moderate his strong antiabortion position 
with 99 percent of the new jersey precincts counted florio who 
twice before lost gubernatorial races had 1356957 or 62 percent 
rep james courter had 824505 or 38 percent 
it was florios third try for the office and he defeated courter 
by a margin of 500000 votes out of about 3 million cast the two 
candidates bombarded voters with negative commercials 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league said tuesdays results proved that the recent 
supreme court decision opening the way for states to restrict access 
to abortion had energized prochoice voters and that politics in 
america would never be the same 
she contended that in the virginia governors race the issue 
of a womans right to choose was so powerful it overcame all other 
issues 
nancy e myers spokeswoman for the national right to life 
committee criticized republicans such as courter and coleman who 
tried to temper their prior opposition to abortion 
courter turned off prolife voters she said 
as for coleman she said he probably could have handled the 
issue a lot better he could have come out a lot earlier attacking 
wilder 
prominent black politicians hailed the results in virginia and 
new york 
if wilder can win in virginia the cradle of the confederacy 
black and other candidates of a new breed can win in georgia in 
mississippi in alabama and elsewhere in the south said rep john 
lewis dga 
there have always been doug wilders in the africanamerican 
community said rep bill gray dpa the assistant house 
majority leader what is changed is that now the white community 
is looking beyond skin they are looking at character and policy and 
leadership

washington a computer security specialist estimated wednesday 
that there have been up to hundreds of thousands of computer virus 
attacks against american corporations and the government in recent 
years 
carolyn conn an official of the edp auditors association told a 
house panel that the majority of incidents go unreported because 
there is not a high expectation of successful prosecution 
also she said organizations do not want to publicize their 
vulnerabilities when seemingly there is little or no benefit from 
public disclosure 
the costs are staggering ms conn told the house judiciary 
subcommittee on criminal justice viruses have cost corporations 
government agencies and educational institutions millions of dollars 
to prevent detect and recover from computer virus attacks 
the panels chairman rep charles e schumer dny asked her 
for a estimate of the overall number of virus attacks that have 
occurred in recent years 
is it tens is it hundreds is it thousands he asked 
ms conn responded i think probably in the hundreds of 
thousands 
the edp auditors association is a 9000member group of 
electronic data processing professionals based in carol stream 
ill a chicago suburb 
at the same hearing the head of another computer industry 
association urged congress to take a cautious approach toward 
legislation intended to help fight viruses and other software 
threats 
like the swine flu vaccine of the 1970s these antivirus bills 
could end up doing more harm than good said john l pickitt 
president of the computer and business equipment manufacturers 
association 
pickitt criticized three antivirus bills whose chief sponsors 
are reps wally herger rcalif c thomas mcmillen dmd and 
edward j markey dmass 
outlawing some of the programming techniques used to create 
computer viruses might prevent the use of similar programs for 
beneficial purposes including countering a virus said pickitt 
chief of cbema a washingtonbased trade association whose member 
companies had combined sales last year of more than 230 billion 
hergers bill would impose penalties of up to 20 years in prison 
on people convicted of interfering with the operations of 
computers through the use of programs containing hidden commands 
that can cause harm 
the mcmillen measure would punish anyone who willfully and 
knowingly sabotages the proper operation of a computer hardware 
system or the associated software markeys bill would make the 
introduction of a computer virus into an interstate electronic 
network a federal crime 
computer viruses generally are small strings of computer code 
that can infect legitimate computer programs and may cause 
destruction or alteration of data files

democrat l douglas wilder claimed a 
hairbreadth victory that would make him the nations first elected 
black governor but republican j marshall coleman refused to 
concede said he would demand a recount 
fewer than 8000 votes out of 17 million cast separated the two 
candidates in the unofficial returns from tuesdays election which 
saw the largest voter turnout for a statewide election in virginia 
history 
reports from the states 1967 precincts gave wilder 889869 
votes to 882137 for coleman 
coleman called a news conference today to announce that he would 
ask for a recount if the official tally shows the candidates 
separated by less than one half of one percent of the votes a 
certainty based on the unofficial figures 
let me first say that i congratulate doug wilder on a 
hardfought campaign and if he is certified the winner he will have 
my full support coleman told reporters at his northern virginia 
campaign headquarters 
however he said that for the good of the new governor it is 
necessary that the public have complete confidence in the results 
wilder who also held a news conference today dismissed a 
suggestion that the racial factor threw his election into doubt 
while his white running mates for lieutenant governor and attorney 
general won substantial victories 
im saying it is not and was not a factor in the results 
because i was elected wilder said 
earlier he said on abcs good morning america that his vote 
totals were a sign of the gains made by blacks in america 
its an excellent testament to the people of virginia to the 
people of this nation as to how far weve come in a very short span 
of time the 58yearold lieutenant governor said 
the people of virginia have spoken wilder told supporters 
tuesday night at a jubilant rally whatever it takes thats what 
i want to win by 
but coleman a 47yearold former attorney general did not 
accept defeat 
this race is not yet over he told supporters we dont yet 
know what the outcome is 
this governors race is too close to call said donald 
huffman chairman of the state republican party this is a race 
thats going to be recounted all we ask for is a fair and honest 
counting of the ballots 
the difference between the candidates totals was well within the 
1 percent separation required for a recount and possibly within the 
half a percent margin that allows the apparent loser to seek a 
recount without risk of having to pay for it if results are 
unchanged 
the state board of elections will meet nov 27 to certify the 
results coleman then would have 10 days until dec 7 to request 
a recount there is no timetable in state law for completing a 
recount 
observers could not recall a closer gubernatorial race and the 
65 percent of the 25 million registered voters who turned out also 
appeared to set a record 
wilder campaigned as the heir to two successive democratic 
administrations headed by charles s robb now a us senator and 
gov gerald l baliles who could not succeed himself under virginia 
law 
he noted that 80 percent of the virginia electorate is white and 
cited this as evidence that race had not been a factor in the 
election 
instead of letting race be a factor they decided the reverse 
he said they believed in me notwithstanding accident of birth 
class or any other demarcation 
coleman who lost the 1981 race for governor to robb said 
virginians wanted a change and pointed to five tax increases in four 
years under baliles 
but the leading issues in the campaign were abortion and 
questions about the moral character of the candidates 
wilder took a strong prochoice stand and charged that coleman 
who opposed abortion except to save the life of the woman wanted to 
set back the clock on womens rights 
wilder blasted coleman for accepting huge contributions from 
northern virginia real estate developers although wilder himself 
had wealthy backers among them john w kluge whom forbes magazine 
identified as the richest man in america 
campaign reports filed by the candidates showed that wilder had 
raised 646 million and coleman 805 million in the third most 
expensive gubernatorial election in the nations history including 
the sums spent during primaries 
jack w gravely president of the state chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said that if 
wilders victory stands it would inspire hope among the nations 
blacks 
but i do not think that one night in this state can erase years 
of degradation and segregation gravely said 
wilder a millionaire lawyer grew up in richmond in what he 
described as gentle poverty he earned money for college by 
waiting on tables at whitesonly political dinners in downtown 
richmond and became the first black to sit in the virginia senate 
since reconstruction 
coleman a shenandoah valley native who has practiced law in the 
washington dc suburbs for eight years has been out of office 
since the loss to robb a moderate in the state gop he was 
discouraged from running in the 1985 lieutenant governors race by 
party conservatives 
the republican party registered a net gain of four seats in the 
state house of delegates a result that left democrats with a 5939 
majority

prehistoric humans may have raided the 
nearest pond when they got a hankering for leftover mastodon 
daniel fisher of the university of michigan said evidence hes 
uncovered at a pond in southcentral michigan indicates prehistoric 
humans would make a bag from part of a mastodons digestive tract 
and fill it with sand and gravel making an anchor for the meat 
this is the first physical evidence documenting its use in 
prehistoric times he said 
fisher on wednesday presented the results of his work to a 
meeting of the geological society of america in st louis 
the heisler site contains remains of a mastodon which died about 
11000 years ago the remains are in clusters some of which are 
surrounded by gravel and sand 
our working hypothesis is that the mastodon was killed some 
distance from the pond fisher said hunters would have quickly 
butchered the animal into manageable sections 
large portions of bone meat and fat were then apparently 
carried to the pond submerged and marked with posts shoved 
vertically into the pond bottom after that the kill site may have 
been abandoned to scavengers

an electoral aftershock to the san francisco earthquake wrecked 
plans for a new home for the baseball giants while voters concerned 
with less seismic matters dealt blows to gay rights pay raises for 
texas lawmakers and money for schools in michigan and washington 
the giants and their fans now face an uncertain future 
giants owner bob lurie said after san francisco voters tuesday 
narrowly defeated a plan to build a new waterfront stadium to 
replace windswept candlestick park 
the same voters also rejected a domestic partners proposal 
that would give unmarried municipal workers both heterosexual and 
homosexual the same funeral and sick benefits as married couples 
and in irvine calif voters reversed an ordinance protecting 
homosexuals against discrimination mayor larry agran called the 
reversal on discrimination meanspirited 
but michael shea a leader of the irvine values coalition said 
special protection for homosexuals is something were not prepared 
to give at this point 
the oakland suburb of concord repealed an ordinance banning 
discrimination in housing and employment against aids victims it 
was the first time a community held a referendum on ending 
discrimination against people with aids or the virus that causes it 
among the winners in tuesday voting on local and statewide 
propositions were smoking curbs in tobacco country tax money to 
help utah lure the winter olympics higher taxes to fight drug wars 
in kansas city more prisons for texas and a new government for new 
york city 
the san francisco stadium vote left more questions than answers 
but lurie was adamant about one thing candlestick park cannot 
stand as a longterm home to the giants the owner of the national 
league champions said 
he said the team would play the 1990 season at the reviled 
29yearold stadium where the giants would play after that was open 
to question lurie said he would move the team possibly to san jose 
or sacramento unless a new 115 million downtown stadium was built 
candlestick suffered minimal damage in the oct 17 earthquake 
but blueprints for the proposed downtown stadium were less 
fortunate opponents of the new park said it was no time for the 
quakedamaged city to spend money on such a project 
the stadium question was fiercely contested falling 1977 votes 
short of passage out of 171487 votes cast 
but the giants didnt strike out completely voters in scottdale 
ariz approved 84 million to build a new stadium and keep the 
giants from moving their spring training site to florida 
the new stadium will hold 7000 fans about 1800 more than the 
current park holds

1998 olympic winter games to their state 
kansas city mo area voters approved a quartercent increase in 
the sales tax to raise 98 million during the next seven years to

but voters gave thumbs down to tax hikes for education in 
michigan and washington michigans electorate rejected two 
proposals to increase the state sales tax to generate 400 million 
for schools 
washington state voters soundly rejected a childrens 
initiative to hike the sales tax by nearly a penny per dollar to 
help raise at least 360 million a year for smaller school classes 
early childhood education childabuse and drug education the 
measure failed by a 70to30 percent margin 
elsewhere st louis voters rejected a fourcent property tax 
increase to subsidize the st louis symphony 
the closest vote involved limiting smoking in some public places 
in greensboro nc where the tobacco giant lorillard inc employs 
2000 workers and more than half the citys registered voters smoke 
by only 173 votes of 29809 votes cast the electorate banned 
smoking in elevators and certain stores while requiring restaurants 
seating more than 50 people to set aside a quarter of their seats 
for nonsmokers the measure passed 14991 to 14818 
i dont think its going to cost you any jobs said david 
hudgins spokesman for greensboro to alleviate smoking pollution 
its just going to give everybody a place of quiet enjoyment to go 
out and be happy together and get along 
in texas the proposal to triple the current 7200 salary of 
state lawmakers to 23300 went down by more than 2to1 a proposal 
to boost the expense allowance from 30 to 81 also was rejected 
but texans who had 21 ballot proposals to determine favored the 
dropping of a 113yearold provision requiring state officeholders 
to swear they didnt bribe their way into their positions the vote 
was 2to1 to drop it 
a 500 million water measure to bring running water and sewers to

communist leader egon krenz faces 
growing troubles as confusion spreads among east germans who are 
tempted to join their friends and families heading west experts and 
politicians said wednesday 
the communist party is fighting for its life like a drowning 
man said an east berliner walking past the partys central 
committee headquarters on unterwassertrasse 10 no 10 under water 
street 
krenz after just three weeks as communist party chief threw out 
the aging politburo on wednesday and replaced the ruling body with 
reform proponents but some said krenz himself could be ousted 
unless he seizes the initiative 
the conservative west german newspaper die welt compared krenz 
and his men with the crew of a sinking ship 
water is breaking in everywhere through the rotting planks 
the newspaper said in an editorial they are grasping at 
everything to stop the leaks 
hansjochen vogel the leader of the west german leftist 
opposition social democrats stressed the urgent need for democratic 
reforms 
a german democratic republic that is bleeding to death whose 
supply system is breaking down and whose economy is failing wont be 
able to reform at all vogel told parliament it will sink into 
lethargy or even chaos 
there were questions about whether the politburo shakeup would be 
enough to keep east germany from veering out of control especially 
since krenz has insisted the communist party keep its leading role 
in society 
just changing a few faces is not enough said volker ruehe 
the general secretary of chancellor helmut kohls christian 
democratic party the new politics has to take into account what 
the people of east germany want and that is an end to the 
communist partys monopoly on power 
backed by the united states west germany and other countries 
the opposition has called for free elections 
a leader of an east german political party allied with the 
communists demanded a constitutional change to revoke the 
communists monopoly on power and urged free elections 
we have seen that the current constitutional basis cant 
protect the country from instability said liberal democratic 
party vice chairman hansdieter raspe 
another allied party the national democrats demanded krenz give 
proof of ability to lead 
krenz hounded by a lack of support among east germans has 
become a target of ridicule among the hundreds of thousands of 
people who have taken to the streets to demand democracy 
grandmother why do you have such long teeth read one 
placard at saturdays millionstrong demonstration in east berlin 
with a leering grinning krenz replacing the wolf of the little red 
riding hood fairy tale 
most east germans watch west german tv which has given ample 
coverage to the democratic changes sweeping poland and hungary 
krenz just doesnt enjoy any trust said christian schreiber 
an east berlin dental technician who joined one of europes largest 
single postwar migrations by fleeing to bavaria with his wife and 
child last weekend 
as the number of refugees approaches 200000 there is growing 
confusion for those left behind 
there is mental chaos as ordinary east germans are torn 
between staying and fleeing to the west said josef janning of the 
university of mainz 
the east germans are confused about their identity janning 
said the life they were accustomed to is breaking down with 
every departure 
suddenly they are forced to make a decision do i head to the 
west or dont i janning said its one thing to dream about how 
nice it would be to visit the west and live there its another to 
be asked by your own children do we go or do we stay 
for ordinary east germans there are the daily inconveniences of 
stores shut down because workers have fled and the anxiety of 
knowing that the flight to the west has stripped the country of 
hundreds of its doctors and nurses opposition leaders note the 
country is losing the equivalent of a village every day as east 
germans turn their backs on the communist system 
the people of east germany have unmistakably shown they wont 
be satisfied with cosmetic improvements said dorothee wilms the 
bonn cabinet minister in charge of relations between the two german 
nations 
janning said krenz is not a reform type and warned that the 
new leader could be ousted within months if he fails to seize the 
initiative 
klaus boelling the former head of bonns diplomatic mission in 
east berlin said the politburo resignations were a sign of total 
helplessness and powerlessness and predicted they would fail to 
stabilize the growing crisis 
i urgently wish that krenz in the interest of millions of east 
germans would realize that he doesnt enjoy confidence at all in 
his own country boelling told saarland state radio

the treasury began to replenish its coffers 
wednesday after lastminute congressional action raising the debt 
limit averted the governments firstever default 
the treasury sold 16 billion in three and sixmonth bills in 
its weekly auction that was postponed on monday because the 
governments borrowing authority had dropped to 28 trillion a 
level its debt already surpassed 
the drop also forced postponement of 40 billion in quarterly 
refunding auctions and treasury secretary nicholas f brady said the 
government would default if congress failed to act by midnight 
tuesday 
without congressional action the treasury would have been unable 
to redeem 138 billion in bills that mature thursday 
congress approved legislation shortly before the midnight 
deadline raising the debt ceiling to 31 trillion for the fiscal 
year ending next sept 30 president bush signed the bill wednesday 
morning and the treasury rescheduled its auctions starting with the 
shortterm bill offering that afternoon 
the treasury on wednesday also resumed sales of us savings 
bonds and special securities for state and local governments the 
temporary investment vehicles for money those governments raise in 
the bond market that had been suspended 
the treasury said the newly scheduled quarterly refunding will 
include auctions of 10 billion in threeyear notes on thursday 10 
billion in 10year notes next monday and 10 billion in 30year 
bonds next tuesday the treasury also said it would reoffer 10 
billion in 36day cash management bills on friday 
in addition to the note auction the treasury plans to hold its 
regular weekly auction for 16 billion in three and sixmonth bills 
next monday 
in wednesdays auction interest rates on shortterm treasury 
securities fell to their lowest level since last month 
the treasury department sold 8 billion in threemonth bills at 
an average discount rate of 767 percent down from 778 percent 
last week another 8 billion was sold in sixmonth bills at an 
average discount rate of 749 percent down from 762 percent last 
week 
the rates were the lowest since threemonth bills sold for 752 
percent on oct 23 and sixmonth bills averaged 742 percent on 
oct 16 
the new discount rates understate the actual return to investors 
793 percent for threemonth bills with a 10000 bill selling for 
980610 and 789 percent for a sixmonth bill selling for 
962130 
the debt limit fell from 287 trillion to 28 trillion on oct 
31 after senate action raising the ceiling became stalled over 
republican demands that the legislation also include a capital gains 
tax cut that demand was subsequently dropped 
although the us government had never defaulted on its debt 
before it came close on several occasions 
for example it had to dip into social security funds to keep its 
line of credit open in 1985 and in 1983 a delay in increasing the 
debt limit forced the government to exhaust its line of credit 
leading to a suspension of savings bond sales restrictions on 
deposits to the social security funds and cancellation of scheduled 
securities auctions 
the national debt has more than tripled since the beginning of 
the decade as the treasury was forced to borrrow more and more money 
to finance government spending that exceeds tax receipts 
the annual deficits have gone down from their peak of over 200 
billion a year but the deficit still totaled 1521 billion in the 
year ending last sept 30 
the grammrudman budget law itself passed as part of a 1985 debt 
bill that put the limit above 2 trillion for the first time 
mandates that congress and the president reduce the deficit in 
fiscal 1990 to 100 billion fiscal 1990 began oct 1

eugene fodor a virtuoso violinist who rode the 
roller coaster of fame from a dazzling high of winning a medal in 
the 1974 tchaikovsky competition to a dizzying low of a drug bust in 
july says he is on the upswing again 
fodor 39 whose violin recital saturday night in peekskill 
north of new york city was his first public appearance since he was 
charged with drug possession and breaking into a motel room said of 
his performance 
i had a feeling of freedom of expression that i cant remember 
having had before to that degree it seemed like the channels were 
really open from the emotions i was feeling through to the music 
with the sense of starting with a clean slate fodor once 
dubbed the mick jagger of classical music headed wednesday from 
new york to iowa for a performance saturday with the sioux city 
symphony from there he goes on to a threenight stint in phoenix 
the performances were scheduled before fodors runin with the 
law and he said he is grateful no one canceled 
in addition ive gotten some additional engagements because 
people want to hear the new me he said in a telephone interview 
tuesday from his manhattan home 
an edgartown mass judge placed the musician on three years 
probation last month as part of a plea arrangement in which drug 
charges were dropped and fodor pleaded guilty to breaking and 
entering a motel july 27 on marthas vineyard 
fodor spent 28 days in a drug rehabilitation center in new york 
state and under the terms of the probation he is to continue drug 
treatment and submit to random testing 
after the bust many who knew the flamboyant violinist said he 
had trouble coping with his stalled career after such a splashy 
start fodors winning the silver medal at the tchaikovsky 
competition at age 24 no gold was awarded that year made him the 
first american prize winner in that prestigious competition since 
van cliburn took the gold in piano in 1958 
the posttchaikovsky prize publicity painted the denverborn 
violinist as an atypical classical musician a young allamerican 
western male who grew up on a ranch and loved to ride jog and swim 
i had a lot of publicity that wasnt of a very serious nature 
which created an image that i wasnt serious which is not the 
truth he said 
for the first few years there were whirlwind engagements and 
television appearances then his popularity began to wane critics 
accused him of playing only showy crowdpleasing selections and said 
he lacked musical maturity 
fodor said he feels better about his music now than in 1974 
what other artists are doing in comparison with what im doing is 
not an issue with me any more im grateful for what i have im 
grateful to be alive 
he said he remembers everything leading up to his arrest i 
never blacked out i went to marthas vineyard to ride my bicycle i 
stopped at 11 at night i couldnt summon the clerk at the motel i 
rang the buzzer repeatedly i walked in the first room i came to 
wasnt locked 
i think it was divine intervention the way the whole thing came 
about the maids woke me up in the morning i could have left and 
not paid and not gotten arrested i waited one and a half hours for 
the manager to get there when she did she had the police on the 
phone i was trying to give her money for the room i had over 100 
i had cocaine in an aspirin container i had a chance to throw 
it away i wanted to go to rehab and i knew id never commit 
myself 
although authorities charged fodor with heroin possession as well 
as cocaine fodor said the trace of heroin they found in the back of 
his car wasnt his 
he said he used cocaine for about four months before his arrest 
and that he is shocked now when he realizes he played under the 
influence of the drug at the last few concerts before his arrest 
the reason i got into cocaine is because i have the disease of 
addiction im an extremely compulsive and obsessive person it 
served me well in learning violin and being able to master difficult 
works he said 
he didnt abuse alcohol fodor says because he didnt like 
hangovers 
now said fodor im willing to accept what life has to offer 
it wasnt easy getting to this place it is so rewarding im 
enjoying life more every day i really dont have any desire to have 
a drink or a drug 
the feeling is a lot better than i ever got on drugs

when l douglas wilder was a boy he would 
get on the trolley that ran near his church hill home and take a 
seat up front then his mother would make him move to the back 
her explanation would be one day this will all change said 
wilder a 58yearold grandson of freed slaves who grew up in what 
he describes as gentle poverty in segregated richmond 
wilder now a millionaire lawyer who has served the past four 
years as lieutenant governor claimed a narrow victory over 
republican j marshall coleman in tuesdays governors race a 
triumph that would make him the first elected black governor in us 
history 
with only about 5000 votes separating the two candidates out of 
more than 17 million cast coleman refused to concede and said he 
would ask for a statefinanced recount 
if wilder is ultimately sworn in as governor he will occupy an 
executive mansion just blocks from the once whiteonly clubs where 
he waited on tables at political dinners to earn money for college 
wilder one of eight children set out on a career in medicine 
he got a chemistry degree from virginia union university a 
predominantly black school here but then was drafted into the army 
and sent to korea 
he earned a bronze star in the war came home and found his job 
options limited sensing that the 1954 us supreme court ruling on 
school integration would offer new opportunities for blacks wilder 
entered law school at howard university in washington 
after graduating he returned to richmond to open a law practice 
and built a reputation in the 1960s as an upandcoming criminal 
trial lawyer 
in 1969 wilder entered politics when one of the citys two state 
senate seats became vacant he ran for the seat against two white 
opponents and won becoming the first black in the virginia senate 
since reconstruction 
as a senator wilder allied himself with a group of young 
moderate colleagues who were poised to challenge the bodys 
established conservative leaders the alliance proved fruitful and 
the moderates took control 
wilder advanced quickly becoming chairman of four committees 
over a 16year career he never faced opposition for reelection 
but despite his insider status wilder occasionally took stands 
that were considered militant by virginias political mainstream at 
the time 
he fought for years for a state holiday to honor slain civil 
rights leader martin luther king jr and he attacked the state 
song carry me back to old virginia because of lyrics that 
blacks find offensive 
the king holiday didnt become law until 1985 and only after it 
was joined with a holiday paying tribute to confederate heroes 
robert e lee and stonewall jackson the state song was never 
changed although it is seldom sung in public 
in 1982 wilder threatened to run as an independent against gov 
charles s robbs handpicked us senate candidate owen b 
pickett who had angered wilder by paying homage to the 
oncesegregationist byrd dynasty pickett withdrew his candidacy 
when wilder decided to run for lieutenant governor in 1985 he 
and fellow democrat robb again were at odds after robb encouraged 
others in the party who were interested in the no 2 office to run 
none did wilder was nominated without opposition and political 
experts said the presence of a black on the ticket spelled doom for 
democrats 
instead wilder and his ticketmates swept all three of the 
states top offices wilder got 52 percent of the vote against 
republican state sen john chichester of fredericksburg 
as lieutenant governor wilders chief function was to preside 
over the state senate and cast tiebreaking votes but he also used 
the office as a campaign pulpit by delivering warm welcoming remarks 
to dozens of groups visiting the gallery each day the general 
assembly was in session 
wilder has been at odds occasionally with democratic gov gerald 
l baliles he opposed after the fact passage of a 1986 sales 
tax increase that helped finance baliles 10 billion roadbuilding 
initiative 
but baliles as well as robb stayed in wilders camp and 
wilders only serious potential opponent for the nomination for 
governor attorney general mary sue terry decided to seek 
reelection 
wilder ran what he described as a virginia campaign that 
emphasized his new mainstream candidacy he steered clear of 
appeals on minority issues and vowed to avoid letting race be the 
focus of his effort 
you and i have a responsibility to make certain that what takes 
place on november 7 isnt something that should happen once in a 
lifetime but something that should be expected he told an 
audience of black college students last month 
wilder who is divorced has three children

a thirsty and hungry abiud upendura 
stood in line for nine hours on the first day of voting in namibias 
elections but he still had to return wednesday to cast his ballot 
im ok he said i feel right because i want my 
independence 
voters again turned out in large numbers wednesday the second of 
five days of voting for an assembly that will write a constitution 
and make namibia independent of south africa after 74 years 
upendura 22 and many others camped overnight at their places in 
line or went home to sleep after failing to reach the voting booths 
tuesday when some lines extended more than a mile the lines were 
slightly shorter wednesday but again the heat was sweltering 
helicopters are being used as mobile voting stations in some 
remote areas visiting a different village each day 
on tuesday 210053 people cast ballots 30 percent of the vast 
mineralrich territorys 701483 registered voters 
given the circumstances in this country this is a mammoth 
achievement said david venter a spokesman for the namibian 
administration appointed by south africa which captured the 
territory from germany in world war i 
south africa had resisted un efforts to get it out of namibia 
since 1966 but finally agreed to grant independence under the world 
organizations supervision no independence date has been set but 
namibia is expected to be free by early next year 
despite heat in the 90s and slowmoving lines voters turned out 
in numbers almost equal to those of tuesday said un spokesman 
fred eckhard 
he said there were scattered incidents of intimidation and 
distribution of bogus pamphlets aimed at discrediting the favored 
party the southwest africa peoples organization which fought a 
23year bush war against south african occupation 
a territorial official said three children were killed when a 
grenade they found exploded the territorial radio said a baby was 
killed and several people injured in pushing and shoving tuesday at 
two northern polling stations 
eckhard said the un could not confirm the death of the baby but 
that a child was among three people injured in one incident 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said in 
washington that the bush administration was very encouraged by 
initial reports that turnout was heavy and voting was proceeding 
smoothly he called on all parties to abide by election rules 
the election focuses on whether swapo which leans to the left 
will win twothirds of the seats so it can write a constitution 
without consulting other parties 
its chief rival is the democratic turnhalle alliance a 
multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy and was part 
of the transitional government installed by south africa

at the corner of huntington avenue and francis 
street in mission hill near where a pregnant woman was abducted and 
shot to death there are now few signs of the murder that outraged 
the city 
in the hours that followed the shooting of carol stuart and her 
husband charles police fanned out over this innercity 
neighborhood in droves questioning housing project residents for 
leads but the trail of the person who shot them two weeks ago as 
they left a childbirth class seems to have grown cold 
a lone police car cruised by a package store wednesday a group 
of teenagers lounged on the steps of fermoyle drugs across from 
the intersection where it is believed the woman and her husband were 
first confronted 
there are all kinds of crimes that happen here said hibah 
mohamed 23 who was walking down huntington avenue and these 
guys who live around here know how to hide very well 
police and city officials are silent after a highly conspicuous 
presence in the days after the shooting police say they dont want 
to jeopardize the case and have been told by the suffolk county 
district attorney not to talk 
were not saying anything police spokesman jim jordan said 
wednesday we dont want the investigation played out in the 
papers we probably wont say anything until theres a real break 
mrs stuart 30 a tax attorney from the suburb of reading who 
was seven months pregnant was shot in the head by a gunman shortly 
after she left a birthing class at a hospital near the roxbury 
section oct 23 she and her husband 29 were accosted in their 
car probably while they paused at a stoplight police said the 
gunman forced them to drive a short distance into the mission hill 
section where he robbed and shot them 
stuart called police on the cars cellular telephone and in a 
dramatic 10minute plea for help recorded by police led them to the 
car where his wife lay dying as he lapsed in and out of 
consciousness 
mrs stuart died after delivering the couples son by caesarean 
section charles stuart and his son christopher are at separate 
hospitals in boston stuart is listed in stable condition and the 
infant is still in a neonatal intensive care unit officials wont 
comment on his condition 
police in reading the suburb 13 miles north of boston where the 
stuarts lived sent a detective to help boston police with the 
investigation 
we are confident that they will catch up with this person 
said reading lt bob silva people are still talking about it here 
and theyre still upset 
a 29yearman arrested on an unrelated burglary charge a few days 
after the killing was questioned as a possible suspect police 
refused to call him an official suspect however he is still in 
custody following acquittal on the burglary charge tuesday because a 
new charge of armed robbery was brought against him the same day 
residents around mission hill have grown skeptical 
they would have caught him by now if they were going to said 
michael stewart 18 a busboy at the mississippi restaurant cafe 
which is adjacent to the stoplight where it is believed the stuarts 
were first abducted

the opposition party leader called on the 
government wednesday to try to arrange a meeting between president 
bush and libyan leader col moammar gadhafi during the superpower 
summit off malta next month 
bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev are scheduled to 
hold shipboard meetings off the mediterranean island nation dec 
23 
socialist party leader and former prime minister karmenu mifsud 
bonnici said the government should try to arrange a bushgadhafi 
gettogether to help reduce tensions between the two countries 
mediterranean countries he said give a high priority to the 
reduction of tension in the area and to closer relations between 
the united states and libya 
on monday bonnici said his party will stage an antinuclear 
demonstration during the summit that will also demand a timetable 
for withdrawing foreign fleets from the mediterranean 
the bush administration has said previously it was not ready to 
hold talks with libya it said last month that libya is still 
providing funds weapons safe havens and training facilities to 
terrorists 
bonnici was the prime minister in april 1986 when malta gave 
libya advance warnings of the us air raids on the libyan cities 
of benghazi and tripoli 
maltese air traffic controllers told their libyan counterparts 
that the warplanes were approaching however libya apparently did 
not act on the information thenpresident reagan said the bombing 
raids were intended to punish libya for its alleged support of 
international terrorism 
the socialists were voted out in 1986 after 16 years in power 
and the conservative government of prime minister eddie fenech 
adami has loosened its ties with libya and moved closer to the 
united states and western europe

a national strategy for improving 
transportation in rural america was outlined wednesday in a report 
by the agriculture department 
no new major federal or state spending program was recommended 
but massive cooperative efforts by government and the private 
sector at all levels were urged including a diversification of 
funding and planning 
martin f buzz fitzpatrick jr head of the departments 
office of transportation which issued the report said the 
findings and recommendations were based on regional meetings going 
back two years and a national conference in omaha neb in august 
1988 
from the very beginning this initiative has been a 
cooperative activity involving a wide range of public and private 
agencies seeking solutions to the transportation problems of rural 
residents he said 
fitzpatrick added that the report will give rural transportation 
organizations a practical guide to help in planning and policy 
development at national state and local levels 
although no specific mode was recommended over another the 
report referred to passenger transportation generically 
meaning that it could include rail bus or air travel depending on 
the circumstances 
the report said cooperation between public and private sectors 
is essential if rural passenger transportation is to meet the 
mobility needs of rural residents and that new approaches must be 
found 
in mobilizing support for rural passenger transportation the 
report said a national plan for rural communities to maintain and 
expand passenger transportation should be a top priority for action 
communities are an essential source of financial and volunteer 
support for rural passenger transportation providers the report 
said effective community participation can generate support for 
continued intercity bus service and provide financial and volunteer 
support for rural public providers

the bush administration is greatly 
concerned that israel may have provided south africa with american 
technology used in a south african missile test a us official 
said wednesday 
as a result an israeli request to buy six supercomputers from 
the united states will be given special scrutiny the official said 
at an arms control symposium on the eastern shore of maryland 
the request is being held because we are concerned the 
official said we are greatly concerned israel could have 
transferred us technology 
questions have been raised over the years about israels military 
ties with south africa the official speaking under seminar rules 
that barred further identification acknowledged that the united 
states does not know the extent of israels relationship with south 
africa 
but the official said technology used by south africa in last 
summers missile test exceded the countrys known capabilities 
israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin told the cabinet last 
month that israel had not given south africa any military technology 
developed or funded by the united states 
the denial followed a statement by president bush that transfers 
of forbidden technology were taboo and that it would not 
enhance relations if israel defied the united states to help south 
africa develop a nuclearcapable intermediaterange missile 
nbc news had reported that israel provided pretoria with knowhow 
from israels canceled lavi jet plane program financed largely by 
the united states 
the us official who spoke at the arms control symposium also 
raised questions about a south african fighter plane known as the 
cheetah saying it was virtually a mirror image of an israeli 
plane 
also the official raised questions about israels program known 
as aarow that is designed to defend against ballistic missiles that 
are proliferating in the arab world 
on a related subject the official said the united states had not 
reached a conclusion whether south africa conducted a nuclear test 
10 years ago with israeli help 
earlier another us official said poland in a strong show of 
independence would disband four of its 13 military divisions 
polish authorities also have notified the soviet union that it would 
not participate in an upgrading warsaw pact forces the official 
said 
two other divisions are being placed on standby which means 
about 10 percent of the division troops will remain on active duty 
while the remaining will be sent home the four disbanded divisions 
have about 40000 troops 
poland told the soviet union it was taking the steps because of 
economic necessity the us official said at an arms control 
symposium at the wye plantation on the eastern shore of maryland 
the official who could not be identified under the seminar 
rules said the soviets apparently raised no objections 
the soviets also are in the midst of a partial withdrawal from 
eastern europe rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed 
services committee said last week that three tank divisions had 
been pulled out in past 11 months although some new artillery had 
been sent into the region 
poland and hungary are showing their independence in other ways 
as well us officials said they are putting pressure on the 
soviet union for the warsaw pact to reach agreement with nato in 
vienna on a reduction of troops and nonnuclear weapons across 
europe 
polish and hungarian officials are speaking out and registering 
their views in the negotiations for the first time the official 
said 
reporting progress on a 1987 treaty to abolish us and soviet 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles officials said the soviets had 
destroyed 297 of their arsenal of 654 ss20s the others are due to 
be scrapped over the next two years 
the united states keeping pace has eliminated 486 of its 846 
intermediaterange rockets covered by the treaty 
the united states this week is installing a 38 million xray 
device at votkinsk the factory where ss20 missiles were 
manufactured to improve inspection of rail cars carrying other 
stilllegal missiles from the factory

victories by black democrats in municipal and 
state elections signal a new direction for black politics and 
will likely result in more blacks running for elected office as 
moderates several analysts said wednesday 
the victories will help set a new direction in black politics 
because black candidates were successful in many cases where the 
black voting population remains a very small minority said linda 
williams a fellow at harvard universitys kennedy school for 
government 
on tuesday david dinkins was elected as the first black mayor of 
new york and l dougles wilder was apparently elected as governor of 
virginia if wilders apparent victory holds up he will become the 
nations first black governor 
blacks also took control of city halls in new haven conn 
seattle cleveland and durham nc in detroit coleman young was 
elected to an unprecedented fifth term as mayor 
one of the first sort of practical developments i think well 
see is more blacks taking a chance running in places where blacks 
are not the majority said williams who specializes in race and 
politics 
she said blacks chose not to run previously under those 
circumstances because they saw little likelihood of winning 
but williams and other analysts say the exhilaration blacks may 
feel with these successes is tempered by the moderation of the 
candidates and their campaigns some analysts argued that the 
winners were forced to be moderate almost to the exclusion of 
economic and social issues more traditionally associated with black 
candidates 
williams noted that both wilder and dinkins distanced themselves 
from the rev jesse jackson twice a presidential candidate 
but jackson dismissed attempts to disconnect himself from 
tuesdays electoral victories 
if after the 88 campaign of dukakis there had been an 
increase in greek registration if you now had a greeek chairman of 
the democratic party and a greek governor of virginia and mayor of 
new york and new haven and seattle and cleveland no one would be 
trying to find the disconnection because the connection would be so 
very apparent jackson told reporters outside the washington 
hilton hotel 
it was clear that the roger ailes forces were going to use me 
as the willie horton force for polarization in new york said 
jackson in a reference to george bushs use of a black massachusetts 
murderer in what many termed a negative 1988 presidential campaign 
against michael dukakis ailes is a campaign consultant 
we stepped back strategically jackson said 
if were members of the same team does it really matter who 
scored the touchdown if were members of the same team if we win 
the championship all of us get the ring jackson said 
other analysts say the elections may signal harder rather than 
easier times for black politicians and their base constituency 
what were going to have is that its going to make it much 
more difficult for the black community said james turner a 
political sociologist at cornell university 
turner called the victors clubhouse politicians who have 
said they are not going to speak to the black community while they 
assume their support 
these people have taken a very cautious moderate position a 
kind of noneconomic liberal position turner said 
i think this could be deceiving because it has not prepared the 
white electorate for the really difficult decisions said turner 
of political candidates who still want to run on the platform 
more geared toward the poor williams said im not sure that they 
will see a lot of hope for that strategy 
if they dinkins and wilder couldnt have done what they did 
it really would have been a hopeless situation said williams 
also noting that many of tuesdays victors are black politicians who 
worked their way up the democratic party structure 
williams said that although both dinkins and wilder garnered 
support from many of the whites who voted for jackson in 1988 their 
successes tuesday may show him hell have to moderate it even more 
and change his campaign style

soldiers killed eight guerrillas in 
northern colombia the army reported wednesday and a newspaper said 
a former rebel leader who had served in congress was convicted of 
treason by former comrades 
meanwhile an antidrug crusading journalist shot three times by 
hitmen hired by traffickers died wednesday from his injuries 
interior minister carlos lemmos simmonds deplored the slaying of 
world vision tv news director jorge enrique pulido who was shot 
oct 29 in his car in downtown bogota 
we will continue lamenting deaths such as these until we win 
the war against drug traffickers simmonds said pulido the 46th 
journalist to be killed in colombia since 1977 was the most recent 
victim of the war that began in midaugust when the government vowed 
to crack down on colombian drug barons 
el tiempo said the death sentence of braulio herrera was 
suspended and he went into exile in moscow 
a defense ministry statement said the guerrillas killed in two 
battles tuesday were from the national liberation army one of six 
colombian guerrilla groups 
it said five were killed near bagre a town 200 miles north of 
bogota and three near simiti 230 miles north of the capital 
herrera was a field commander of the colombian revolutionary 
armed forces guerrilla group 
he was elected to congress in 1986 for the patriotic union party 
which guerrillas organized as part of a peace effort by belisario 
betancur then president of colombia 
for years the guerrilla group had controlled a part of central 
colombia called the middle magdalena a stretch of about 200 miles 
along the magdalena river which runs nearly the length of colombia 
paramilitary groups opposed to the guerrillas gained control of 
the area during the truce with the betancur government the 
guerrilla leadership asked herrera to take command in the middle 
magdalena and restore its dominance el tiempo said quoting four 
former guerrillas 
herrera had 109 combatants of a unit of about 200 guerrillas 
executed on suspicion of being army spies el tiempo quoted the 
former insurgents as saying 
it said that practically destroyed guerrilla influence in the 
area and the guerrilla high command tried herrera for treason el 
tiempo did not say when the trial occurred 
according to newspaper the former guerrillas said a group of 
leftists they did not identify interceded to get the death sentence 
suspended 
the prosoviet colombian revolutionary armed forces was organized 
more than 30 years ago and is believed to have about 3000 
combatants

the house and senate unanimously approved bills 
repealing the catastrophic health insurance surtax wednesday in a 
parliamentary step that clears the way for conferees to work out a 
final solution 
the carefully orchestrated action was calculated to simplify the 
parliamentary procedures under which the highly volatile issue will 
be resolved 
the net effect to was to leave the two houses precisely where 
they have been substantively on the legislation since early 
october but to clear out legislative underbrush 
by having a freestanding bill to work with conferees will be 
able to negotiate without the extraneous pressure time and 
otherwise of having their work attached to broader legislation 
several conference committee members have expressed optimism they 
can reach agreement by next week clearing the way for final action 
on the legislation 
major new parts of the original catastrophic health legislation 
are to take effect jan 1 and medicare officials are required by 
law to notify beneficaries of those changes unless they are repealed 
the bill passed by the house on a unanimous voice vote followed 
wordforword the language approved earlier on a 36066 vote calling 
for outright repeal of the landmark expansion of medicare approved 
last year 
likewise the senate amended the house bill with the exact 
language by which it voted earlier 990 to repeal the surtax but 
retain a small portion of benefits the senate action took less than 
one minute to complete 
prior to the agreement reached by house and senate leaders 
tuesday night to separate catastrophic health from other issues the 
rollback legislation had been attached to a giant deficit reduction 
bill 
there was an aborted attempt by the leadership of both houses on 
tuesday to push conferees to reach an agreement that could be 
attached to a debt ceiling bill passed late tuesday 
however conference committee members on all sides of the issue 
argued that the catastrophic health issues were too complex to be 
handled in such an expedited fashion

claims for the discovery of a new nuclear 
process called cold fusion raise some puzzling questions and are 
too weak to justify special government research efforts an energy 
department advisory panel said wednesday 
the group in a report prepared for energy secretary james d 
watkins said it found no persuasive evidence that the cold fusion 
process would produce useful sources of energy 
university of utah scientists last march first announced they had 
attained cold fusion and the claim sparked worldwide efforts to 
reproduce the phenomenon some laboratories have supported the utah 
claims but most have not 
cold fusion is the claim that the decomposition of water at room 
temperature into hydrogen and oxygen by an electric current passing 
through a palladium electrode leads to the absorption of hydrogen 
atoms in the electrode the atoms then fuse to produce helium and 
large amounts of heat 
if such a process could work on a large scale it would make 
possible limitless supplies of cheap energy 
the panel known as the energy research advisory board 
recommended to watkins that no special funds be earmarked for 
investigating cold fusion and that the government not establish 
special programs or research centers to work on the issue 
nuclear fusion at room temperature would be contrary to all 
understanding gained of nuclear reactions in the last half century 
it would require the existence of an asyetundiscovered nuclear 
process the report said 
the panel said it was sympathetic toward modest support for 
experiments with existing funds this research should focus on 
confirming or disproving the claims that excess heat was produced in 
the university of utah experiment 
separately the advisory board said in a draft interim report to 
watkins that it doubted the potential for using a linear accelerator 
instead of a new nuclear reactor to produce tritium a radioactive 
gas needed to make nuclear warheads 
scientists at brookhaven and los alamos national laboratories and 
at westinghousehanford co in washington state concluded in a 
report earlier this year that a linear accelerator could make 
tritium more cheaply quickly and safely than could a new nuclear 
reactor energy department officials in washington however have 
said the accelerator technology is too uncertain to count on yet 
watkins in august asked his advisory board to study the 
accelerator option 
in a draft of its interim report to watkins the panel said that 
while an accelator would pose fewer safety and environmental 
problems than a new nuclear reactor those advantages may be more 
than offset by the accelerators need for large amounts of 
electricity to operate 
it may be simpler in fact to use a nuclear reactor to produce 
tritium directly rather than have it or a fossil plant produce 
electricity to operate the accelerator the report said 
the panel plans to issue a final recommendation to watkins by 
february

downtown and residential neighborhoods to shake hands and greet 
residents

onetime political ally threeterm city attorney douglas n jewett

rice had 93491 votes to jewetts 67276 a 58to42 percent margin 
seattle can be proud of itself tonight rice had told an 
electionnight victory party proud because were a thinking 
people a thinking city and a city that cares and a city that lives 
up to the progressivity that stands so high and makes it the most 
livable city in the united states 
rice 46 said he would try to form a partnership between city 
government and the schools to defuse tensions that rose over the 
save our schools initiative which sought to end mandatory 
busing for school desegregation 
that initiative which had become a central issue in the mayoral 
campaign remained too close to call wednesday trailing by just 100 
votes 
the nonbinding measure asked the city school board to halt 
mandatory busing of students for racial balance in exchange about 
45 million in city tax revenue would be earmarked for magnet 
programs to achieve racial balance in school enrollment

seattle which has a black population of about 12 percent 
i want to make sure this is a partnership where neighborhoods 
are rewarded for innovation and have police protection rice said 
and i think i can play a role and assist the school district where 
it needs it

affiliation in the strongly liberal democratic city 
but norm and i started the race as friends and we went at it 
as friends and we finished it as friends he said

unprecedented three fouryear terms as mayor he has accepted the

democrat james j florio set out 
wednesday to build a new administration basking in his landslide 
victory for governor and the return of democratic control in the 
legislature 
the florioled sweep gives democrats the ability to redraw 
congressional districts and influence political power after the 
1990 census 
florio who soundly defeated republican rep james courter on 
tuesday was up shortly after dawn wednesday to thank commuters at a 
train station he then met with reporters and announced details of a 
transition team before heading to a scheduled victory rally with 
abortion rights activists 
abortion was one of the issues that helped florio 52 end an 
eightyear republican hold on the governors office democrats who 
already controlled the state senate also reclaimed a majority in 
the state assembly 
the governors race was just getting under way in july when the 
us supreme court gave states more power to restrict abortions 
courter who has a long antiabortion voting record took several 
weeks to remold his position and promise that he would not impose 
his personal views on new jerseys largely prochoice electorate 
by contrast florio despite an antiabortion stance early in his 
political career promised immediately to veto restrictive abortion 
legislation 
courters sometimes unclear position was criticized by both sides 
on the abortion question antiabortion activists accused the 
republican of abandoning them for political convenience while 
prochoice forces never embraced his reformulated stance 
analysts and political loyalists said the florio victory was 
largely a credit to the democrats nearly flawless campaign and 
evidence that courter was hurt by his campaigns internal disarray 
miscues on delicate issues such as abortion and his own conservative 
leanings 
for new jersey republicans wednesday was a day to count the 
casualties and wonder what ended the years of political dominance 
popularity and unprecedented party wealth under gov thomas kean 
who was barred by state law from seeking a third consecutive term 
democrats won at least five assembly seats from republicans 
tuesday and will hold between 44 and 46 of the 80 seats when the 
counting is completed reversing a 4139 gop majority two districts 
remained too close to call wednesday 
in the governors race with all but a handful of precincts 
reporting florio had 1356957 votes or 62 percent to courters 
824505 votes or 38 percent 
florio promised to tackle high auto insurance rates as his first 
priority new jersey where motorists pay an average of 1000 per 
car has among the highest premiums in the nation 
florios victory ended a 12yearquest for the statehouse that 
began when he competed in the 1977 democratic primary in 1981 he 
lost to kean by the narrowest margin in the states history

candidate of the umbrella group opposing the ruling sandinistas 
said after the meeting with bush

all over the world the time for dictatorship is running out 
she said 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega cannot win a fair election

in a clean election in nicaragua he is not going to win 
because the people want a change from totalitarianism to 
democracy she told reporters at the white house 
mrs chamorro visited the white house as the sandinista 
government said it would propose a new ceasefire to be coupled with 
demobilization of the usbacked contra rebels 
ortega said he would bring the plan to reinstate the ceasefire 
he called off last week to a united nationssponsored meeting with 
the contras on thursday in new york 
the plan would include a general amnesty once at least 50 percent 
of the contras have demobilized and the rebels free kidnapped people 
they hold 
mrs chamorro told reporters ortega should have given the amnesty 
long ago and fulfilled other promises of the regional peace accord 
he signed in august with four other presidents of central america 
the contras should demobilize she said adding that the 
sandinista government should fullfil its promises 
contra leaders met wednesday with bush administration officials 
to discuss their approach to the un talks the contras were 
willing to discuss demobilizing their troops said one 
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
their conditions include full amnesty for those imprisoned in the 
war and several confidencebuilding measures aimed at ensuring 
secure conditions for those contras who want to return to their 
homeland 
meanwhile the un security council is sending a 625member 
border patrol force to stop contras from infiltrating the border 
from honduras and to interdict shipments of nicaraguan and cuban 
weapons the state department says are being made to leftist rebels 
in el salvador

total us vegetable output this year is 
expected to exceed the droughtreduced 1988 production an 
agriculture department report said wednesday 
the overall increase is due mostly to a 29 percent boost in 
processing vegetable tonnage and a 3 percent larger potato harvest 
production of processing vegetables is estimated at nearly 15 
million tons while potato output is estimated at around 370 
million hundredweight the output of fresh vegetables in 1989 is 
expected to be up 1 percent mushrooms 14 percent sweet potatoes 
7 percent and dry edible beans 29 percent 
despite the strong increase in us vegetable production the 
value of us vegetable imports is expected to be up by about 5 
percent to a record level the report said 
growth in imports during 1989 stemmed from continued strong 
prices at the wholesale and retail levels and continued strong 
consumer demand the report said most of the imports are fresh 
vegetables which are brought in during the winter months when us 
production is limited to the southerntier states

three major railways said wednesday they will use 
mechanical shaking devices to replace some human wakeup services 
for locomotive operators to save more than 18 million a year 
masamichi kawabata an official of east japan railway co said 
his company made the decision after the governments board of audit 
suggested that it and west japan railway co and central japan 
raiway co end wakeup services provided by outside agencies 
he said east japan will spend 11 million to introduce the 
mechanical devices by next march the devices inflate an air bag 
under the sleeper at a set time to shake him awake 
kawabata said 40 to 50 electric locomotive operators and 
conductors usually sleep in the same room but must get up at 
different times and alarm clocks would disturb everybody in the 
room 
he said that since before world war ii the railroad had 
employed people from a wakeup service agency who went about with 
lists of train schedules and bed numbers waking up railway 
employees one by one 
kawabata said east japan with 83000 workers has 162 
dormitories and 38 of them use the services of outside agencies at 
a cost of nearly 700000 a year 
an official of 50000worker west japan who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said his company will spend 13 million to install 
the wakeup devices in 25 sleeping rooms west japan has been 
spending 11 million a year on wakeup service agencies he said 
an official of central japan said his company also will replace 
the wakeup services with mechanical devices but declined to 
discuss details 
the three companies are among seven corporations formed when the 
staterun 277000worker japan national railways turned private in 
april 1987 
the board of audit still looks into their business since the 
government still holds all stock in the companies

republican j marshall coleman said 
wednesday he would demand a recount of the closest governors race 
in virginia history but democrat l douglas wilder was already 
relishing the historical dimensions of his apparent victory 
it starts coming home to you something happened last night 
wilder said at a news conference the morning after he claimed 
victory as the nations first black elected governor 
just what happened was not absolutely certain although wilder 
still clung to a lead of 5500 votes out of more than 17 million 
cast with all 1967 precincts reporting unofficial results showed 
wilder with 896283 votes to colemans 890750 votes 
because the margin was within onehalf of 1 percent coleman had 
the right under state law to demand a recount at a news conference 
in mclean va he said he would do so 
the outcome although still in doubt has given me a 
responsibility for plainly i am the trustee of the votes of more 
than 880000 virginians who supported me in this contest i have a 
responsibility to them and to all virginians to ensure the person 
with the most votes is declared the winner coleman said 
i congratulate doug wilder on a hardfought campaign and if he 
is certified the winner he will have my full support he added 
but he continued for the good of the next governor whoever 
he may be and for the good of the commonwealth it is essential 
that there be complete confidence in the integrity and accuracy of 
the results 
the state board of elections will meet nov 27 to certify the 
results of tuesdays vote which board secretary susan fitzhugh 
said was the closest contest for governor ever in virginia 
coleman will have until dec 7 to request a recount mrs 
fitzhugh said as far as she knew no such recount had ever been 
conducted in a statewide election she had no estimate of how long 
it would take to tally the votes a second time 
wilders white running mates for lieutenant governor and attorney 
general donald s beyer jr and mary sue terry both won by 
substantial margins prompting questions about the role that race 
played in the campaign 
but wilder dismissed such speculation saying the election 
answered the subliminal question about the importance of race 
im saying it is not and was not a factor in the results 
because i was elected he said i said if i won by 501 percent 
of the vote id be happy thats why you see me happy 
wilder also dismissed questions about whether people were saying 
one thing in preelection polls and exit polls all of which showed 
him leading by a comfortable margin and then voting a different way 
the same polls showed beyer well behind his republican opponent 
edwina p eddy dalton wilder said beyer won 54 percent to 46 
percent 
wilder also said he intended to serve as a fulltime governor 
rather than get involved in national democratic politics as a 
potential black rival to jesse jackson 
i dont think youre going to see me being in confrontation 
with anybody he said however he added that if he were asked and 
had the time he would campaign for democrats in other states he 
also would not rule out a bid for federal office in the future 
he said his victory showed national party leaders that 
democrats dont need to make special appeals to special groups 
because mainstream candidates can win 
the mandate is that in virginia we are prepared to move and we 
dont care what that person looks like he said 
wilder who used colemans opposition to abortion in television 
advertising said it would be wrong to say that his candidacy was 
based on that single issue 
but he said the vote showed that virginians want to move forward 
rather than turn the clock back to when abortions were illegal 
and he criticized president bushs decision to veto medicaid funding 
for abortions

the ap tally of votes in the virginia 
gubernatorial race erroneously gave democrat l douglas wilder 
between 5000 and 18000 more votes than he actually had for about 
an hour tuesday night 
at no point in the count of more than 17 million votes cast did 
the bulge change who was ahead 
the ap figures were based on unofficial reports from county 
clerks 
the problem was caused by doublecounting of returns from a small 
group of heavily black precincts the returns from the precincts 
were being gathered as a special project to provide information on 
black voting patterns in virginia contest the precinct returns were 
to be kept separate from the countylevel tabulation in the ap 
election computer but they were not 
since wilder was running up large margins in the heavily black 
precincts doublecounting inflated wilders margin over republican 
j marshall coleman the degree of the inflation varied during the 
period involved from about 845 pm est until 955 pm est 
exact numbers by which the vote was inflated varied through the 
hourlong period from 5000 votes to 18000 votes 
the ap conducted a complete recanvass of all 136 jurisdictions in 
virginia on wednesday to gather final unofficial returns on the 
race with all those jurisdictions rechecked the count showed 
wilder with a lead of about 5500 votes he had 896283 votes or 50 
percent to colemans 890750 votes or 50 percent

christian fundamentalists 
the gay community has been confronted with fundamentalists for 
three years out here and this was the first test at the polls

antidiscrimination ordinance on people who had a homophobic 
reaction to what shouldve been a health issue 
whitsell also blamed the defeat on apathy 
i am disappointed in the city he said i am disappointed 
in the people who did not get out and vote 
in a measure widely seen as a test of support for gay rights

francisco passed measure d which repealed an ordinance designed to 
protect aids victims from discrimination in housing or employment

a united mine workers leader waged a 
lastminute writein campaign to score an overwhelming victory over 
a democratic legislator whose son a judge has fined his union 
millions of dollars 
don mcglothlin sr would not comment on whether frustration with 
the sevenmonthold umw strike against pittston coal group led to 
his defeat after 22 years in the state house of delegates 
i respect the electorate i have an abiding faith in their 
decision mcglothlin said by telephone from his law office in 
grundy they decided its time for a change and so be it 
jackie stump head of the umw in southwestern virginia said 
tuesday that working people of all sorts not just mine workers 
elected him 
with all 22 precincts reporting stump won 7805 votes to 
mcglothlins 3818 
it shows what working people can do when they stick together 
stump told supporters who gathered outside the umw offices in 
oakwood va tuesday night the nurses the custodians the 
teachers the people who cook the schools the doctors they all 
came out and supported me 
while im proud to be a part of the umw its clear i got

having toilets to flush and safe water to 
drink will help end third world conditions in the impoverished 
colonias along the mexican border community activists 
celebrating voter approval of a water plan said wednesday 
seven years of organizing and lobbying paid off with tuesdays 
passage of proposition 2 said amalia lerma a leader of valley 
interfaith a coalition of 36 churches in the lower rio grande 
valley 
a network of churchbased groups throughout the state have pushed 
for improved conditions in the substandard rural subdivisions for 
years including the statewide water amendment 
two things most americans take for granted drinking water and 
sewer lines will arrive for the first time for thousands of 
colonia residents mrs lerma said 
peope will have toilets to flush she said its not a 
joke this will make a big difference in peoples lives 
sewer systems particularly will help curb the incidence of such 
third world diseases as hepatitis tuberculosis dysentery and 
other gastrointestinal illnesses in the colonias mrs lerma said 
the amendment authorizes a 500 million bond package for water 
projects sewer systems and flood control statewide the colonias 
are to get 100 million of the bond revenues 
the measure passed by a vote of 686475 or 60 percent to 
462582 or 40 percent of the ballots cast 
more than 100000 people are estimated to be living in colonias 
which often are carved out of farmland by real estate developers who 
offer homes for down payments of as low as 100 but never install 
adequate water sewers streets or drainage 
outhouses in back yards are common sights in colonias most homes 
have drinking water but it is not unusual for the water system to be 
contaminated or limited to a single outdoor faucet in the front 
yards 
carmen anaya who has lived in las milpas a colonia south of 
pharr in the lower rio grande valley for more than 30 years said 
wednesday that the amendments passage reminded her of the biblical 
story of a man who said he could die contented after seeing jesus 
last night i went to church and i told god thank you but i 
dont want to die i want to keep working said mrs anaya who 
spent tuesday hauling colonia residents to the polls in a tiny 
chevrolet chevette 
my greatest desire was that our children have water so they 
could bathe and go to school without being covered with dust from 
the streets and being rejected by the other children she said

the tide may be turning in the battle to save 
the african elephant witnesses told a congressional hearing 
wednesday 
for the first time in many years there is hope and confidence 
that the species precipitous decline can be stemmed and even 
reversed in much of africa said curtis bohlen senior vice 
president of the world wildlife fund 
but the united states must do more including increasing its 
spending for antipoaching measures in africa according to bohlen 
and other conservationists testifying before the house subcommittee 
on fisheries and wildlife conservation 
it has been bitterly disappointing to me to see how little 
money congress has appropriated to the african elephant 
conservation fund a paltry 350000 for this fiscal year bohlen 
said 
that amount will not save many elephants he added 
witnesses said worldwide recognition of the plight of the 
african elephant has begun to have an impact on poaching which has 
been decimating the population for years agreements by the united 
states and japan to ban ivory imports and antipoaching actions in 
africa have been crucial to the effort 
rep gerry studds dmass who chairs the subcommittee said 
merely declaring the elephant an endangered species is not enough 
our goal is not simply to save a few elephants here and there 
for zoos and parks studds said our objective must be to 
restore elephant populations to work with the international 
community and with the nations of africa to bring those populations 
back up to sustainable levels to provide a source of income for 
countries in desperate need of revenue 
witnesses said that the banning of ivory trade has in some 
instances already had an impact on poaching by reducing the market 
for ivory 
the absence of market demand and steppedup enforcement 
efforts have combined to greatly reduce the toll on elephants 
bohlen said ivory presently has no value in tanzania where 1840 
poachers and traders have been arrested incredibly tusks have 
been found washing down the ruaha river dumped by culprits who no 
longer can sell them 
susan lieberman of the humane society of the united states said 
disagreements among african countries some of which do not 
consider their elephant populations endangered must be settled 
before more progress can be made 
she also said steps must be taken to curb recreational hunting 
despite arguments that costly hunting licenses provide revenue to 
protect elephant herds 
nevertheless lieberman said the international agreements on 
banning trade and helping to fight poaching mark significant 
progress in the past year 
the african elephant has been granted a ceasefire 
lieberman said

a federal judge wednesday prohibited 
antiabortion protesters from blocking half a dozen abortion clincs 
in the district of columbia 
us district court judge louis oberdorfer issued the 
preliminary injunction against operation rescue and veterans 
campaign for life which plan demonstrations the next two weekends 
in the nations capital 
the injunction was issued at the request of the national 
organization of women and nine other groups and medical facilities 
oberdorfer rejected a request from now to broaden the injunction 
so that it covers all three dozen or so abortion facilities in the 
metropolitan area 
at a court hearing earlier this week attorney john schaefer 
said operation rescue has harassed and intimidated women seeking 
abortions inflicting psychological and emotional harm during 
blockades outside clinics in various parts of the country 
jay sekulow said nows allegations are devoid of facts and 
that there is no evidence operation rescue is involved in any type 
of violent activity outside clinics 
patrick mahoney an operation rescue consultant said he has 
been in washington for five weeks planning this weeks 
demonstrations and that i have no idea whether blockading 
abortion clinics is among the activities 
questioned by the judge mahoney said there is a possibility 
operation rescue has plans mahoney doesnt know about 
operation rescue is sidestepping back and forth by refusing 
to say whether its members will trespass on private property at 
abortion clinics said attorney laurence eistenstein 
but they will as they have in the past eisenstein asserted 
to the judge 
eisenstein said operation rescue has become a little more 
sophisticated by using euphemisms like rescue for breaking 
the law

airline officials told a congressional panel 
wednesday that proposals that could lead to reregulation of the 
industry would hurt service rather than improve it 
the message i hear is that we are free to be innovative free 
to risk capital free to compete as long as we lose money robert 
l crandall head of american airlines told the senate commerce 
science and transportations aviation subcommittee 
if we are successful the rug is likely to be pulled out from 
under us he said 
the subcommittee heard testimony on a bill that would alter 
several practices sponsors say have driven small airlines out of 
business and kept others from starting up 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio meanwhile introduced the airline 
reregulation act that would go much further allowing the government 
once again to regulate fares routes and services 
congress deregulated the industry in 1978 
i dont know if complete reregulation is the answer 
metzenbaum said in announcing the bill but i do know its time we 
owned up to the fact that airline deregulation was a mistake 
metzenbaum was the leadoff witness before the subcommittee 
which was discussing an airline competition bill opponents said also 
would reregulate 
that proposal sponsored by sens john c danforth rmo and 
john mccain rariz would force big airlines to give up their 
computerized reservations systems stop them from booking flights on 
smaller airlines as if they are their own end the selling of slots 
at major airports and strengthen the governments hand to increase 
competition 
instead of a proliferation of choices consumers are 
increasingly faced with little or no choice mccain said about 
airline service 
crandall however told the committee the proposals would 
diminish not enhance competition 
he acknowledged that computer reservations systems give airlines 
who own them a competitive advantage but denied that was because of 
anything built into the systems provided to travel agents for 
booking all their flights 
why should we be deprived of an advantage we have earned 
crandall asked 
he said that rather than trying to restrict successful airlines 
the government should concentrate on building more airports and 
other facilities to increase competition 
james w callison a senior vice president of delta air lines 
said forced divestiture of reservations systems would produce 
increased air fares 
callison said a provision of the bill that would prevent airlines 
from linking up with small commuter airlines would punish airlines 
that have not taken over smaller carriers 
deltas connection carriers operate as independent companies 
not owned by delta and are major examples of small business at its 
best he said 
edward r beauvais chief executive of the smaller america west 
airlines indicated general support for the bill and suggested it 
also call for an internal revenue service investigation of frequent 
flyer programs 
these programs although quite popular are among the most 
antithetical to the spirit and goals of airline deregulation 
beauvais said 
he noted that while businesses often pay for the original 
tickets employees can use the frequent flyer bonus without being 
taxed for the benefit 
the programs do not promote new business they simply allow 
airlines to charge higher prices for the business that they are 
already receiving beauvais said 
most us airlines including america west award flights and 
other benefits for customers who regularly fly with them

victories by black democrats in municipal and 
state elections signal a new direction for black politics and 
will likely result in more blacks running for elected office as 
moderates several analysts said wednesday 
the victories will help set a new direction in black politics 
because black candidates were successful in many cases where the 
black voting population remains a very small minority said linda 
williams a fellow at harvard universitys kennedy school for 
government 
on tuesday david dinkins was elected as the first black mayor of 
new york and l douglas wilder was apparently elected as governor of 
virginia if wilders apparent victory holds up he will become the 
nations first black governor 
blacks also took control of city halls in new haven conn 
seattle cleveland and durham nc in detroit coleman young was 
elected to an unprecedented fifth term as mayor 
one of the first sort of practical developments i think well 
see is more blacks taking a chance running in places where blacks 
are not the majority said williams who specializes in race and 
politics 
she said blacks chose not to run previously under those 
circumstances because they saw little likelihood of winning 
but williams and other analysts say the exhilaration blacks may 
feel with these successes is tempered by the moderation of the 
candidates and their campaigns some analysts argued that the 
winners were forced to be moderate almost to the exclusion of 
economic and social issues more traditionally associated with black 
candidates 
williams noted that both wilder and dinkins distanced themselves 
from the rev jesse jackson twice a presidential candidate 
but jackson dismissed attempts by others to disconnect him 
from tuesdays electoral victories 
if after the 88 campaign of dukakis there had been an 
increase in greek registration if you now had a greeek chairman of 
the democratic party and a greek governor of virginia and mayor of 
new york and new haven and seattle and cleveland no one would be 
trying to find the disconnection because the connection would be so 
very apparent jackson told reporters outside the washington 
hilton hotel 
it was clear that the roger ailes forces were going to use me 
as the willie horton force for polarization in new york said 
jackson in a reference to george bushs use of a black massachusetts 
murderer in what many termed a negative 1988 presidential campaign 
against michael dukakis ailes is a campaign consultant 
we stepped back strategically jackson said 
if were members of the same team does it really matter who 
scored the touchdown if were members of the same team if we win 
the championship all of us get the ring jackson said 
saying that many of tuesdays winners were either delegates of 
our campaign or voters for our campaign jackson said he had won 
the 1988 democratic presidential primary in all the areas where 
black candidates were successful tuesday 
in many ways the electorate yesterday was less sexist and less 
racist and more fair and more mature than ever before in american 
history he said 
other analysts say the elections may signal harder rather than 
easier times for black politicians and their base constituency 
what were going to have is that its going to make it much 
more difficult for the black community said james turner a 
political sociologist at cornell university 
turner called the victors clubhouse politicians who have 
said they are not going to speak to the black community while they 
assume their support 
these people have taken a very cautious moderate position a 
kind of noneconomic liberal position turner said 
i think this could be deceiving because it has not prepared the 
white electorate for the really difficult decisions said turner 
of political candidates who still want to run on the platform 
more geared toward the poor williams said im not sure that they 
will see a lot of hope for that strategy 
if they dinkins and wilder couldnt have done what they did 
it really would have been a hopeless situation said willims also 
noting that many of tuesdays victors are black politicians who 
worked their way up the democratic party structure 
williams said that although both dinkins and wilder garnered 
support from many of the whites who voted for jackson in 1988 their 
successes tuesday may show him hell have to moderate it even more 
and change his campaign style

president bushs nominee to be us ambassador 
to honduras told senators on wednesday that a recent decision to 
permit hondurans to vote by simply flashing an identity card opens 
the door to election fraud 
cresencio arcos jr 45 a texasborn career diplomat commented 
in response to questions during confirmation hearings before the 
senate foreign relations committee 
the issue was raised by sen christopher dodd dconn chairman 
of the panels latin american subcommittee who said such a method 
of voter registration could allow one person to vote in seven 
different places 
arcos who is currently deputy assistant secretary of state for 
central america said the bush administration has made its concern 
over the development known to the honduran government 
under the new rule he said it would be possible for someone 
to vote in several different precincts 
that is a wide open invitation for widespread fraud dodd 
told the nominee 
you certainly can reach that conclusion arcos replied it 
lends itself to that 
arcos a native of san antonio joined the united states 
information office in 1971 and has served in portugal brazil the 
soviet union and honduras 
in 1985 he was named deputy director of the nicaraguan 
humanitarian assistance office which was responsible for 
distributing 27 million in socalled humanitarian aid to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
the committee is set to endorse the arcos nomination shortly 
sending it to the senate floor where early confirmation is expected 
arcos will replace ambassador everett briggs

david dinkins gave the thumbsup sign wednesday 
to hundreds of people who welcomed him to city hall where he will 
begin work in january as the first black mayor of the nations most 
populous city 
frankly im flabbergasted he said i was very surprised 
to find so many people im delighted 
dinkins first day after defeating rudolph giuliani by fewer than 
50000 votes was spent getting acquainted with his workplace 
he met with mayor edward i koch and then said at a news 
conference that he might not have won without the immediate support 
koch gave him after dinkins defeated the threeterm mayor in a 
september primary 
with all but three of the citys 5237 precincts reporting the 
unofficial count showed dinkins with 898900 votes or 50 percent 
while giuliani a former federal prosecutor who ran as a reformer 
had 856450 votes or 48 percent conservative and right to life 
candidates each had 1 percent 
dinkins 62 said he recognized the importance of his role in 
history 
clearly i see myself as a person who has the privilege of 
representing a large number of people not just in new york but 
across the country who are africanamericans and i am very proud 
to accept that he said 
but theres also leadership of the largest most important and 
greatest urban center in the world and they really go hand in hand 
if i can do my job well then africanamericans across this land 
will be proud that i have done that he said 
koch meanwhile said hell fall behind the curtain gracefully 
but hinted he will stay in the wings 
im going to differ with him on occasion privately in the 
beginning publicly later on he said 
i loved being the mayor but its not the whole ed koch he 
added i have other facets to my personality which you will soon 
see he said 
the same might be said about giuliani some republicans and at 
least one prominent democrat said they wouldnt be surprised to 
see the former prosecutor challenge gov mario cuomo next year 
if i was mario cuomo i would be worried said john dyson a 
wealthy democrat who worked in the administration of former gov 
hugh carey 
democratic consultant william cunningham also said he was 
impressed by giuliani 
he got 48 percent in a democratic city against a 51 
registration edge up against every leading light of the national 
democratic party cunningham said 
his reference was to the highlevel assistance dinkins received 
during the campaign from cuomo koch sen edward kennedy the rev 
jesse jackson and others but wednesday was a day for celebration by 
people with less prominent names as well 
on the streets of the city from subways to stores to hotels to 
the steps of city hall people like 29yearold shelley miller and 
32yearold arlene hamilton were talking about tiny differences they 
already perceived in their city as a result of dinkins victory 
i do feel theres a new respect said ms miller who is 
black 
noting that taxis often refuse to pick up black people she 
recalled how a friend told her early wednesday as they emerged from 
dinkins victory celebration oh we wont have any problems 
getting a taxi tonight 
actually we did get a cab like that last night she said 
with a laugh and a snap of her fingers

a nonbinding ballot question declaring 
english the official language of lowell passed overwhelmingly over 
the objections of minority groups who fear it could jeopardize 
federal funds 
the measure which passed tuesday by a vote of 14575 to 5679 
was strongly opposed by minorities in a city of about 100000 that 
is home to 25000 hispanics and asians 
school committeeman george kouloheras proposed the measure not 
as a statement against minorities he said but to determine the 
support for a common tongue 
the united states of america has been enriched by the cultural 
contributions of immigrants with many traditions but blessed with 
one common language that has united a diverse nation and fostered 
harmony among its people kouloheras said in statement 
critics had warned that federal discretionary funds for 
bilingual programs could go elsewhere if the city took such a stand 
daniel lamb director of the massachusetts office of refugees 
and immigrants called the vote regrettable and said he hoped 
voters would reconsider the measure in the future

the house on wednesday preserved the states 
ability to adopt stricter oil spill liability laws than the federal 
government in a move environmentalists called a victory and the oil 
industry wants vetoed 
this is a fundamental right of the states said rep george 
miller dcalif who along with rep gerry studds dmass led the 
fight to maintain existing state discretion against the oil 
industrys call for change 
their effort was approved by a 279143 vote that inserted the 
provision into a massive bill that determines how oil spill cleanups 
will be financed and managed a vote on the whole bill is expected 
thursday 
the legislative package has been in the works for years but was 
pushed to the forefront after the tanker exxon valdez ran aground 
last spring in prince william sound alaska dumping 11 million 
gallons of crude oil into the pristine waterway 
michael francis of the wilderness society called the action 
very significant and a victory for environmentalists 
this is one of the biggest environmental votes this year he 
said 
the american petroleum institute lobbied heavily against the 
provision and said it would urge a presidential veto if it is not 
changed in a conference committee 
the oil spill liability legislation passed by the senate also 
allows states to have tougher laws this is the first time in 14 
years of considering such measures that the house has gone along 
with the senate in adopting an explicit recognition of state 
discretion but congress has never prohibited the states from 
adopting stricter laws 
twentyeight states have their own oil spill liability statutes 
nineteen set no limits on the amount that should be spent by oil 
companies or carriers for cleaning up damaged environments 
a key concern raised during house debate was whether the 
insurance costs for transporting oil would be prohibitively high if 
states continue to demand more money from the oil companies and 
carriers for spills 
operators involved in transportation of petroleum products may 
feel its not worth the legal risks said rep norman lent rny 
home heating oil may suddenly disappear 
before the valdez oil spill we had not seen a spill that 
created more than 100 million to 200 million worth of damage 
said rep thomas carper ddel its not going to be easy to get 
insurance in the future 
a 2 billion price tag has been put on the exxon valdez cleanup 
if the house plan is adopted into law many responsible 
transporters of oil will likely be driven out of business and 
replaced by less financially responsible and capable shippers 
said the petroleum institute 
the states right to preempt the federal statute was supported 
by the national governors association the coastal states 
association the national association of attorneys general and 
environmental organizations

communist party chief egon krenz swept the old 
guard from the ruling politburo in a desperate attempt wednesday to 
stem flight to the west appease prodemocracy protesters and 
strengthen his 3weekold leadership 
east germans disillusioned by 40 years of rigid rule and 
skeptical of promises continued leaving in droves proreform 
groups pleaded with their countrymen to stay and help build a 
real democratic society but more than 50000 had arrived in west 
germany since saturday 
krenz made a stinging attack on his predecessor and mentor 
erich honecker and communist authorities took the first steps 
toward registering new forum the nations largest prodemocracy 
group 
officials in frankfurt an der oder legalized new forum locally 
and the local christian democrats a small party previously allied 
with the communists gave them space in its building the official 
news agency adn reported 
the party propaganda chief said free elections might be possible 
adn said 25000 people in neubrandenburg rallied for free 
elections greeting the leaderships decisions with whistles and 
15000 protested in limbachoberfrohna near karlmarxstadt 
our country is going through a tense and extremely difficult 
development krenz told the central committee which unanimously 
approved his proposal to dissolve the 21member politburo and form 
a smaller one 
central committee members reaffirmed krenz 52 as party leader 
and announced the election of an 11member politburo krenz and six 
other politburo members were reelected 
four new members chosen for the politburo the nations most 
powerful body included hans modrow the 61yearold dresden party 
chief said to be a leading advocate of reform 
modrow was proposed for the post of premier which has been 
empty since tuesdays resignation of premier willi stoph 75 and 
the entire council of ministers or cabinet 
parliaments presidium was to meet thursday to set a date to 
elect a new cabinet 
in washington deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk 
said the bush administration hoped the shakeup is a step on the 
road to stable and evolutionary reform 
the aging politburo members dropped were closely associated with 
honecker 77 whom krenz replaced oct 18 they included stoph 
ideology chief kurt hager erich mielke head of the dreaded 
security apparatus and parliament speaker horst sinderman 
krenz accused the old guard of hesitant even repelling 
attitudes and said wrong judgments were made about the 
situation and there was no reaction to questions long posed by 
daily life 
independent noncommunist groups would be allowed a greater 
role in society krenz said because the politburo thinks that 
citizens movements that are within the constitution should be 
legalized 
it was unclear how much power any such group would have because 
the constitution guarantees the leading role of the communist 
party and krenz has said that is not open to debate 
the interior ministry has accepted new forums application to be 
legalized and the ministry will decide in three months new forum 
was outlawed in september but has been tolerated of late 
krenz has been under growing pressure at home and abroad to 
allow free multiparty elections like those held in poland and 
planned for hungary 
politburo member guenter schabowski the partys new propaganda 
chief and one of those reelected said such elections were 
possible 
when we have an election law that gives all political forces 
the opportunity to draw up and represent their own programs the 
communist party will stand he said 
schabowski the east berlin party chief and a leading reform 
advocate gave no timetable or details and said the party would 
not embark on such a course with the suicidal notion that it 
could be swept from the political stage 
in bonn west german chancellor helmut kohl offered badly needed 
financial support to east germany if the communists surrender their 
monopoly on power 
we are not prepared to support a system that has lost its 
legitimacy kohl said but we are prepared to offer 
farreaching help if genuine and thoroughgoing political and 
economic reforms take root 
the central committee decisions and krenzs speech were reported 
by the state news agency adn the central committee which approves 
leadership and major policy changes has 163 members but only 157 
attended wednesdays session 
on the west german border wednesday police said 50000 east 
germans had arrived since saturday when the communist government 
allowed them to go west via czechoslovakia it was the first time 
east germany opened a direct channel to the west since the 
communists built the berlin wall in 1961 
nearly 200000 mostly young east germans have left their country 
this year either by emigrating legally or by fleeing through 
hungary czechoslovakia or poland west germany grants east germans 
automatic citizenship and helps them start new lives 
in a dramatic appearance on national tv author christa wolf 
read an appeal from five unofficial proreform groups including 
new forum to east germans to stay in their homeland 
help us to build a real democratic society ms wolf said 
we need you have confidence in yourself and in us stay

a judge made key rulings wednesday in favor of the 
prosecution in the manslaughter case against the miami officer 
whose shooting of a black motorcyclist touched off january riots 
the jan 16 shooting by officer william lozano 30 of 
motorcyclist clement lloyd 23 and the death of passenger allan 
blanchard who also was black in the subsequent crash touched off 
three days of racial violence 
defense efforts in pretrial motions to introduce the drug 
connections and police record of lloyd were denied by dade circuit 
judge joseph farina during a break in jury selection 
you dont get summarily executed because you are a drug 
dealer prosecutor richard shiffrin told the judge 
farina also said the prosecution could use testimony about miami 
city police regulations to indicate whether lozano acted 
negligently and unprofessionally 
the defenses only consolation came when farina ruled it may 
bring up 55 grams of marijuana found on lloyds body as well as 
1500 cash he had in his pocket 
the defense may also tell jurors that lloyd had alcohol and a 
high level of thc marijuanas active ingredient in his 
bloodstream the judge however barred any such testimony for 
blanchard 24 
he reserved judgment on testimony about minute amounts of 
cocaine found in lloyds nose 
wednesdays hearing touched on the key issues for both sides in 
the case against the colombianborn officer who faces two 
manslaughter counts 
lozano fired one shot hitting lloyd in the head and killing 
him as the motorcyclist sped away from another officer 
in the subsequent rioting one person was killed 11 wounded by 
gunfire and 13 buildings were burned down in predominantly black 
neighborhoods 
defense attorney roy black sought to bolster his clients 
selfdefense argument by saying lloyd was willing to run over the 
officer to avoid arrest 
calling lloyd a man who was in overtown collecting his drug 
profits for the day the attorney said he didnt want to stop 
he wanted to escape 
black said lloyd was going right through lozano to get away 
the defense also sought to introduce statements contending the 
prosecution was racially and politically motivated and that some 
prosecutors had privately acknowledged that but the judgedenied 
that 
questioning of prospective jurors which began monday 
continued by midafternoon the jury pool had been narrowed down 
to 42 people comprised of seven blacks five hispanics and 30 
nonhispanic whites

a palestinian state in the israelioccupied 
west bank is inevitable and further us and israeli rejection of 
this conclusion could be dangerous according to a study by the 
rand corporation 
the study written by the cias former chief analyst on the 
middle east graham fuller also concluded that the israeli and 
american search for palestinian spokesmen who are not members of 
the palestine liberation organization is to all intents and 
purposes dead 
the rand corporation is a research center financed mostly by the 
defense department but fullers report was a project he initiated 
before joining the organization and was not requested by the 
administration said rand spokesman jess cook 
the united states and israel both rejected the plos declaration 
of a palestinian state in the west bank when it was made last year 
but while the united states has said it would accept a 
palestinian state in the west bank if it was the result of 
israelipalestinian negotiations israel flatly opposes such a 
state on the land it captured in the 1967 mideast war 
the administration has been trying to get israel and the 17 
million palestinians under israeli occupation to negotiate a 
political settlement but israel has asked for us assurances that 
the plo will be excluded from such talks which would initially be 
convened to arrange elections in the west bank 
the united states has been trying to negotiate a course between 
israeli rejection of the plo and pressure from egypt and the plo 
itself to be included in all talks the administration reversed a 
13year ban last december and launched lowlevel talks with the plo 
in tunis 
to talk to the plo is to move a long way toward recognizing 
the legitimacy of palestinian aspirations for a state said the 
rand report hardline israeli politicians know this which is 
why direct talks with the plo are absolutely anathema indeed with 
the establishment of direct talks between the united states and the 
plo israel now has whether it wants them or not indirect 
negotiations with the plo 
entitled the west bank and israel point of no return the 
report suggests that the forces unleashed by the 23month 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule have now made the 
ultimate emergence of a palestinian state on the west bank 
inevitable 
such a process will be long painful and complex but no other 
solution any longer seems viable 
it warns that continued efforts by either side to resist what 
now seems the inevitable compromise of conflicting national 
aspirations will prove frustrating and perhaps even costly 
fuller advises israel to accept this reality and assume 
leadership in bringing about creation of such a state it is 
important that the birth of the new state not be perceived as an 
arab victory born of force and violence for this might encourage 
further attempts to use force against the israeli state

president bush promised wednesday to lift the 
trade embargo against nicaragua if the usbacked presidential 
candidate violeta chamorro defeats leftist president daniel 
ortega in the february election 
the statement came after a meeting in which mrs chamorro asked 
bush for aid to help with economic reconstruction after the 
election and the two agreed on the need to muster international 
support for fair elections according to us and nicaraguan 
participants 
the united states spent millions of dollars under president 
reagan to fuel the contra rebels in their war to oust ortega 
bush while endorsing a diplomatic rather than military 
approach has continued the policy that ortega should be removed 
from office he supports mrs chamorros candidacy signing a 9 
million election aid package that will in large part boost her race 
a statement issued by white house spokesman roman popadiuk said 
that mrs chamorro had stressed in a letter to bush that her 
administration would be committed to reconcilation and 
reconstruction of the economy in peace and democracy 
should this occur the president said the united states would 
be ready to lift the trade embargo and assist in nicaraguas 
reconstruction the statement said 
the trade embargo was imposed in may 1985 banning imports from 
or exports to nicaragua 
the president looks forward to the day when with a democratic 
government nicaraguans will have good political and economic 
relations with the united states and the rest of the free world and 
will be able to begin rebuilding after decades of dictatorship 
the statement said 
mrs chamorro visited bush as part of an international trip 
seeking to focus the global spotlight on nicaraguas feb 25 
election 
i am looking to my democratic friends to tell them my desire 
for solidarity for the future of nicaragua mrs chamorro 
candidate of the opposition coalition opposing the ruling 
sandinistas said after the meeting with bush 
she also will go to rome london madrid and paris to solicit 
international pressure for fair open elections said her 
associate ernesto palazio 
we need more than ever the eyes of the world to be fixed in 
nicaragua dont look anywhere else even for a single minute 
mrs chamorro said earlier at a luncheon sponsored by the roman 
catholic human rights group puebla institute 
all over the world the time for dictatorship is running 
out she said 
ortega cannot win a fair election mrs chamorro said 
in a clean election in nicaragua he is not going to win 
because the people want a change from totalitarianism to 
democracy she told reporters at the white house 
mrs chamorro stands to benefit from much of the 9 million the 
united states is sending to help with electionrelated preparations 
such as voter registration and poll monitoring 
the president and mrs chamorro agreed that although the 
nicaraguan government has taken several measures to permit greater 
freedoms the sandinistas have not fully complied with their 
agreement of aug 4 with the opposition coalition more needs to be 
done such as providing equal access to television and full amnesty 
for political prisoners popadiuks statement said 
mrs chamorro visited the white house as the sandinista 
government said it would propose a new ceasefire to be coupled 
with demobilization of the usbacked contra rebels 
ortega said he would bring the plan to reinstate the ceasefire 
he called off last week to a united nationssponsored meeting with 
the contras on thursday in new york 
the plan would include a general amnesty once at least 50 
percent of the contras have demobilized and the rebels free 
kidnapped people they hold 
mrs chamorro told reporters ortega should have given the 
amnesty long ago and fulfilled other promises of the regional peace

sudan has halted the un faminerelief 
operation in its southern provinces because of renewed fighting 
with rebels in the region officials said wednesday 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said any prolonged 
suspension of aid to southern sudan where about 250000 people 
died of starvation in 1987 would result in severe food shortages 
and the interruption of critical immunization and health programs 
officials of operation lifeline sudan intended to prevent more 
starvation in the region confirmed that lt gen omar hassan 
elbashirs government had suspended relief flights rail shipments 
and distribution by barges 
in april the government and rebels of the sudan peoples 
liberation army agreed to a truce so relief supplies to be 
delivered by the un operation elbashir who ousted the elected 
government of prime minister sadek elmahdi on june 30 had 
promised to end the war 
the truce generally held until last month when the government 
said rebels seized the town of kurmuk 
planes bombed two rebelheld towns in the south after the kurmuk 
battle and the rebels blamed the government which did not respond 
to the charge 
operation lifeline sudan saved over 200000 sudanese civilians 
this year by moving 107000 tons of food in the south before the 
rainy season isolated villages 
perez de cuellar said he is greatly concerned about the 
suspension because the operation can only be successful if its 
air road and river transport is assured of an unfettered access to 
strategic distribution points 
both sides were accused in 1987 of using food as a weapon and 
causing even more people to starve 
rebels led by former army col john garang have fought 
moslemdominated central governments since 1983 for greater 
autonomy and economic reforms in the south populated by blacks who 
are predominantly christian or animist

a new york city gallery wednesday rejected a 
request from the national endowment for the arts that it relinquish 
a 10000 federal grant for an aids art exhibition as a possible 
violation of a new antiobscenity statute 
endowment chairman john e frohnmayer informed of the gallerys 
refusal said that although the grant was approved last may the 
funds were never actually sent to the gallery and would be withheld 
pending a legal opinion from the justice department 
in a telephone interview frohnmayer said a review of the 
catalog for the aids exhibition made clear that the nature of the 
show had changed from an artistic focus to a political focus 
the 30000 show is sponsored by artists space a private 
nonprofit arts institution in manhattan where it is scheduled to 
open nov 16 frohnmayer said the gallery refused to accept his 
contention that the show was primarily a political statement and 
that it would not be appropriate to take endowment money for its 
support 
susan wyatt executive director of artists space said 
frohnmayer was informed wednesday of the unanimous decision by the 
gallerys 23 board members to refuse the neas request to 
relinquish the grant she denied that the focus of the exhibition 
had changed from art to politics 
frohnmayer also had asked the gallery in a letter dated nov 3 
to publish a disclaimer stating that the national endowment for 
the arts has not supported this exhibition or its catalog 
the controversy over the aids show titled witness against 
our vanishing illustrated the dilemma that frohnmayer faces in 
trying to support the arts community while enforcing a 
congressional ban on federal support for works that may be 
considered obscene 
ms wyatt said the aids show which portrays the effects of the 
disease on the artistic community contains some images of male and 
female nudity and deals with sexuality in the context of aids 
although that is not the primary emphasis 
the law which congress passed last month at the urging of sen 
jesse helms rnc specifically prohibits federal support for 
depictions of sadomasochism homoeroticism the sexual 
exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts and 
materials that lack serious artistic value 
the legislation was prompted by helms criticism of 45000 in 
endowment grants that supported exhibitions of controversial 
photographs by the andres serrano and the late robert mapplethorpe 
whose show included homoerotic images 
in his nov 3 letter to ms wyatt frohnmayer said that given 
our recent review and the current political climate i believe 
that the use of endowment funds to exhibit or publish this work is 
in violation of the spirit of the congressional directive 
he said that certain texts photographs and other 
representations in the exhibition may offend the language of the 
new law 
because of the recent criticism the endowment has come under 
and the seriousness of congress directive we must all work 
together to ensure that projects funded by the endowment do not 
violate either the spirit or the letter of the law he wrote 
the message has been clearly and strongly conveyed to us that 
congress means business 
in his interview frohnmayer said he particularly objected to 
portions of the aids shows catalog which he said contained very 
hostile angry and accusatory statements and very politically 
pointed commentary about helms and other critics of controversial 
art and the aids cause 
ms wyatt said the gallery board in refusing to relinquish the 
endowment grant was taking a stand against censorship and 
selfcensorship 
we believe this is a show that should be funded by the 
endowment she said in a telephone interview from new york it 
is a very regrettable thing that the endowment has been forced to 
take this stand by congress in this political climate we are seeing 
today 
she rejected as totally erroneous frohnmayers contention 
that the exhibition is primarily political 
this is not a show about politics she said its a show 
about aids

the senate on wednesday completed 
congressional action on legislation appropriating 172 billion for 
the state justice and commerce departments and guaranteeing 
reparations payments to japaneseamericans interned in world war ii 
the legislation which was approved on a voice vote was sent to 
the white house where president bushs signature is expected 
the bill fulfills a commitment to japaneseamericans made in 
1988 legislation that authorized reparations payments for their 
internment but provided no money 
it provides 20000 for each of the estimated 60000 living 
japaneseamericans interned in the camps after the japanese attack 
on pearl harbor 
the payments expected to total about 12 billion would begin 
next oct 1 and be spread out over three fiscal years at a rate of 
about 500 million a year 
rep norm mineta dcalif a principal sponsor of the 
reparations legislation said the senate vote tells the american 
people that we will keep this most important promise 
it is a great milestone and heartening victory for those who 
have struggled for more than 47 years to redress the injustices 
which 120000 americans of japanese ancestry were forced to endure 
by the us government during the second world war said mineta 
who as a child was confined to one of the camps with his parents 
the senate left one knot untied in its handling of the overall 
housesenate conference report which resolved differences between 
the two bills 
it left in doubt the scale of appropriations for the state 
department during the 1990 fiscal year which began on oct 1 
by law the state department cannot receive new appropriations 
until congress passes an authorization bill 
that legislation is bogged down in a housesenate conference and 
it is not clear when it will emerge 
the senate last week refused to waive the section of the law 
requiring an authorization bill to be passed 
members of the appropriations committee said that state 
department spending would be frozen at the lower levels that 
prevailed during the last fiscal year until the authorization bill 
clears all hurdles including the possibility of a veto by bush 
who objects to some of its provisions 
the bill also contains the lions share 76 billion of the 
funds to be made available to wage the war on drugs an additional 
19 billion representing a drugwar compromise between congress 
and the white house is contained in a transportation 
appropriations bill 
the final version of the bill formally repeals a law imposing 
economic sanctions against argentina the sanctions imposed at the 
height of human rights abuses during a period of military rule 
were withdrawn by former president reagan in 1983 after argentinas 
return to democratic rule but until now they were never officially 
expunged 
also included in the measure is a provision creating a formula 
to guarantee that small states receive some share of the antidrug 
funds contained in the bill 
among many other provisions is one establishing an fbi databank 
containing socalled dna profiles of convicted felons dna is 
genetic material that law enforcement agencies are just beginning 
to use like fingerprints for identification of individuals 
sen paul simon dill said the new crimefighting tool would 
be similar to the fbis national fingerprint file and the contents 
will be shared with state and local law enforcement agencies the 
measure also provides 500000 to enable the fbi to expand its 
training of dna typing technicians

nicaragua put forth a plan wednesday 
for demobilizing contra rebels and offered to suspend arms imports 
in exchange 
the soviet union said last may it stopped shipping arms to 
nicaragua at the end of 1988 but paul wolfowitz a us defense 
department undersecretary said last week other soviet bloc nations 
and cuba continued sending weapons 
president daniel ortega told a news conference his decision last 
week to end a ceasefire after 19 months had opened the way to 
peace between the leftist sandinista government and ussupported 
rebels 
he said nicaragua would forgo arms imports until april 25 1990 
if the 15point plan was accepted 
president bush on wednesday promised to lift the trade embargo 
against nicaragua if the usbacked presidential candidate 
violeta chamorro defeats ortega in elections set for feb 25 
his statement came after a washington meeting in which mrs 
chamorro asked bush for aid to help with economic reconstruction 
after the election and the two agreed on the need to muster 
international support for fair elections according to us and 
nicaraguan participants 
in their proposal wednesday the sandinistas urge that the 
united states divert to demobilization what remains of 49 million 
in nonlethal aid to the contras authorized by congress in march 
the aid includes such items as boots tents and uniforms 
the 12000 rebels some in nicaragua and most camped in 
neighboring honduras are to be disbanded by early december under 
the regional peace agreement signed aug 7 by ortega and the 
presidents of honduras el salvador costa rica and guatemala 
if the contras dont accept this plan they will be voting for 
war ortega said in apparent reference to the ceasefire 
cancellation and fighting reported since 
he said he would demand a meeting of the central american 
presidents to discuss the situation if the contras rejected his 
proposals 
ortega said he had instructed his governments fivemember 
delegation not to leave the twoday meeting with the contras at 
un headquarters in new york without a signed agreement 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo roman catholic archbishop of 
managua will be present at the meeting which begins thursday 
honduras said it would send an observer delegation that might 
participate more actively after the meeting began military 
commander enrique bermudez leads the contra delegation 
the sandinista plan repeats some points of the aug 7 agreement 
and sets forth the role of the international commission for 
verification and support a joint agency of the united nations and 
organization of american states formed to supervise and verify 
demobilization 
it offers to withdraw sandinista military forces from routes the 
contras use to travel between honduras and nicaragua so rebels in 
nicaragua can return to their honduran camps and to reinstate the 
ceasefire nov 30 
as incentives the sandinistas offer to release all political 
prisoners under a general amnesty after at least half the contras 
have been demobilized and any nicaraguans kidnapped by the rebels 
have been freed 
an annex to the document deals with the governments offers to 
guarantee respect for the rights of contras who return to civilian 
life in nicaragua 
contra leaders have demanded unconditional amnesty 
ortega declared that before he decided to suspend the 
ceasefire there were no hopes for peace now the situation 
has changed favorably 
the sandinistas and contras agreed to a 90day truce in march 
1988 during their last direct negotiations after the talks broke 
down in june of that year ortegas government renewed the 
ceasefire on a monthly basis and the contras tacitly accepted it 
ortega said in declaring an end to the ceasefire that thousands 
of contras had infiltrated nicaragua and were making attacks the 
rebels denied it 
military mobilization began with his announcement and fighting 
was reported in parts of the country but the defense ministry has 
given few details

a threemilelong oil slick snaked down the iowa shore of the 
mississippi river on wednesday while 86 tow boats pushing more 
than a thousand barges were backed up 300 miles south at a lock in 
illinois officials said 
the slick was reported wednesday morning by a leclaire iowa 
resident who found ducks coated with foulsmelling slime said 
police chief david kuhn 
those ducks are goners kuhn said of the 15 to 20 birds 
residents of the town about 10 miles north of bettendorf iowa 
feared more ducks would be endangered as they flocked to the 
village to feed 
the spill involved only 100 to 200 gallons of lubricating oil 
said ensign jane wong of the us coast guard in st louis 
you dont have to have very much oil to have a sheen on the 
water ms wong explained adding the spill had not threatened 
any water supplies 
a contractor was hired to contain the spill with booms and 
remove it she said 
right now the weather itself is containing the spill ms 
wong said wednesday afternoon referring to a lack of strong wind 
the source of the spill was believed to be a boat or a barge 
said dick vons an aide to iowa gov terry branstad the coast 
guard was investigating the source 
illinois gov james r thompson said it was probably one of 
the smallest spills that weve experienced in illinois or in the 
midwest and said crews were cleaning it up less than four hours 
after it was spotted 
as the spill slithered downstream about 1200 barges were 
converged on lock and dam 26 at alton ill waiting in a 36mile 
line to get through the jamup was not related to the oil slick 
the twoweek delay was blamed partly on a temporary gate on the 
main lock chamber that broke from wear and tear and had to be 
repaired said billie sanna a us army corps of engineers worker 
at alton 
we always get this backlog each year she said adding that 
the gate shutdown increased the congestion only slightly 
every year come september and october because the river 
freezes up above they try to get it the barges out of there 
sanna said

democrats savored offyear election success in everything all 
over the country wednesday while blacks and abortion rights 
groups celebrated l douglas wilders likely victory as governor of 
virginia and david dinkins triumph as new yorks new mayor 
its a very tough day for republicans conceded rep newt 
gingrich the gop whip in the house said president bush wait 
till next year 
republican j marshall coleman declared his intention to seek a 
recount in virginias close race saying there must be public 
confidence in the election outcome for the good of the new 
governor coleman said wilder if victorious would have his full 
support 
but wilder leader by about 5500 votes in complete unofficial 
returns from tuesdays balloting wasnt waiting to stake his 
claim to history as the nations first elected black governor 
it starts coming home to you something happened last night 
he said 
asked whether the color of his skin had mattered he told a news 
conference im saying it is not and was not a factor in the 
results because i was elected 
jesse jackson said wilders trailblazing campaign was a little 
sweeter coming as it did in the south and predicted it would 
pave the way for other black politicians to win seats elsewhere in 
the old confederacy 
dinkins went to city hall in new york where he will soon take 
office as the first black mayor of the nations largest city i 
got a pretty fair percentage of the white vote and i think thats 
very important said the man who pledged to bring racial harmony 
to his city 
he said voters had spoken with the voice of hope here and in 
virginia 
in new jersey democratic rep james florio celebrated his 
personal victory as governor after two previous campaign defeats 
democrats savored regaining the states top job after eight years 
as well as twohouse control in the state legislature assuring 
them the upper hand when the states congressional districts are 
reapportioned after the 1990 census 
the republican postmortem was in progress even before the 
final precinct tallies were known 
gingrich said his party must be willing to rethink exactly 
what were going to do in 1990 if were going to have a successful 
year when 34 senate seats 36 governorships and all 435 house 
seats are on the ballot 
sen bob packwood of oregon a liberal republican with a strong 
prochoice voting record said if we go in 1990 and abortion is 
the issue we will lose on that issue 
abortion rights groups read the returns the same way 
this mornings election results are a wake up call for george 
bush an opponent of abortion said kate michelman executive 
director of the national abortion rights action league to 
politicians everywhere we say with conviction if youre out of 
touch with the prochoice majority youre out of office 
there were pre1990 stirrings in massachusetts where gop 
gubernatorial hopeful william weld joined about 20 state 
legislators of both parties in signing a petition for a state 
constitutional amendment to make abortion and birth control a 
womans prerogative 
among the group was a republican state legislator rep lucile 
hicks who predicted you will see a change in the position our 
national leaders will take in this issue 
tuesdays elections were the first widespread voting since the 
supreme courts ruling last summer permitting states to impose 
restrictions on women seeking abortions the topic became an issue 
in all three of the closely watched races and democrats put their 
antiabortion rivals on the defensive in each of them 
theres no way for the republican party to find any silver 
lining at all in what happened yesterday said democratic 
national chairman ron brown 
no time in my lifetime do i ever remember waking up the 
morning after an election where one party had won everything all 
over the country 
the democrats are on a roll said rep beryl anthony of 
arkansas the chairman of the democratic congressional campaign 
committee 
we have recruited better candidates our candidates have 
better mainstream messages and the voters are responding 
coleman called a news conference to announce that if the 
official tally in virginia shows the candidates separated by less 
than one half of one percent a certainty based on unofficial 
figures it is my intention to ask for a recount 
wilder said at his own news conference he was confident of the 
outcome the mandate is that in virginia we are prepared to move 
and we dont care what that person looks like he said 
returns from 99 percent of the precincts in new york gave 
dinkins 50 percent of the vote to 48 percent for republican 
rudolph giuliani 
in new jersey florio had 61 percent of the vote to 37 percent 
to rep james courter with 98 percent of the precincts tallied 
in a texas contest a runoff shaped up between two democrats 
state sen craig washington and houston city councilman anthony 
hall to fill the unexpired term of the late rep mickey leland a 
democrat 
while the national attention was riveted to virginia new york 
and new jersey much of tuesdays action was in the nations cities

waterbury conn a defense lawyer trying to expose details of 
a state police policy of secretly taping telephone conversations 
between suspects and their attorneys grilled a trooper at a 
manslaughter trial wednesday 
in another development us rep john rowland a republican who 
plans to run for governor called on gov william a oneill to 
abandon a state investigation of the matter and cooperate fully 
with a parallel probe by the fbi 
attorney hugh keefe questioned trooper chris garrity who 
inadvertently revealed the policys existence last month and said 
he would subpoena higherranking officials until the policy is 
explained 
were going right up the line said the new haven attorney 
if we dont get adequate answers satisfactory answers well go 
to the top 
the policy of taping calls into and out of state police 
barracks including calls made by suspects to their lawyers was 
described in the hartford courant on tuesday oneill ordered an 
immediate end to the practice and launched the state investigation 
the courants story sent shock waves through courthouses across 
the state outraged defense attorneys predicted that scores of 
criminal cases would be affected and that state officials could 
face heavy penalties if its found they violated state or federal 
wiretapping laws 
rep rowland said in a statement issued by his office in 
washington that the state probe of this sorry situation should 
be dropped because it would lack credibility in the eyes of the 
public 
asked for a response to rowlands statement oneill spokesman 
jon sandberg said the governor has made his position perfectly 
clear he is not in the business of responding to other 
gubernatorial candidates 
oneill earlier said he was anxious to talk to public safety 
commissioner lester j forst who as state police commander is 
responsible for the policy forst is on a hunting trip in alaska 
in hartford the governor said he had no plans to fire forst 
but said all commissioners serve at my pleasure were all 
replaceable its just a question of when 
in waterbury garrity testified in the trial of waterbury police 
detective robert little on drunkendriving and manslaughter charges 
garrity said he originally thought all phone calls from police 
barracks were taped but now is not sure what the policy is 
if you believe these troopers they dont know the extent of 
the system said keefe 
during a pretrial hearing oct 24 garrity mentioned the 
practice of taping all phone calls from state police barracks 
including calls little made to his attorney the night he was 
arrested 
in subsequent testimony garrity backed off from his original 
description of the policy he has said calls are randomly selected 
to be taped but has also said hes not sure which calls are taped 
sgt richard sealander a state police spokesman lent credence 
to garritys initial description when he confirmed in the courants 
story that a policy exists of recording calls from barracks 
including calls by suspects 
keefe on wednesday asked garrity if sergeant sealander said 
that every conversation were taped would you agree with that 
garrity replied if thats what he said yes i would

us negotiators expressed disappointment 
wednesday with the lack of progress in deregulating japanese 
financial markets to allow greater participation by american and 
other foreign investment firms 
treasury undersecretary david mulford who headed the american 
team in toplevel trade talks said that the us side had 
discussed concerns and disappointments in the lack of progress in 
some fundamental areas during the daylong session 
however makoto utsumi the japanese vice minister of finance 
who appeared with mulford at a joint press conference wednesday 
night said his country had made significant progress in 
deregulating its financial markets 
we believe we have been steadily making progress and we intend 
to do so in the future he told reporters 
both sides agreed to establish a working group to explore 
technical questions before their next formal meeting in the spring 
japan whose citizens save at more than double the us savings 
rate has long been an enticing potential market for us banks and 
securities firms 
the discussions began six years ago and have focused on such 
issues as allowing american and other foreign banks and brokerage 
firms to do business in japan other issues have revolved around 
the removal of interest rate caps in japan and other proposals 
mulford noted some progress 50 percent of japanese savings 
deposits are no longer covered by interest rate limits 
he said the japanese government was still resisting attempts by 
american firms to offer an expanded range of investment services to 
japanese investors even though they have a proven track record 
worldwide 
as the talks go forward mulford said us negotiators would 
also be pushing for the removal of barriers that keep individual 
japanese from moving their investments overseas 
the meeting wednesday followed discussions monday and tuesday on 
structural barriers to trade such as japans antiquated wholesale 
and retail distribution system and the close ties that japanese 
companies maintain with each other 
at the end of those talks us officials said they were 
disappointed that the japanese negotiators had not been willing to 
change various business practices that are widely believed to limit 
imports into japan 
both the financial market discussions and the wider talks on 
structural trade barriers are aimed at reducing the huge 50 
billion trade deficit that the united states is running with japan 
a deficit that this year will account for almost half of americas 
total trade imbalance

subway workers and bus drivers 
went on strike wednesday to press pay demands stranding hundreds 
of thousands of commuters 
union spokesman juan palacios said 75000 workers participated 
in the walkout the worst since president carlos menem took office 
four months ago the effectiveness of the strike caught the 
government by surprise and demonstrated wages remain an obstacle to 
plans to reform argentinas economy 
menem went on national television and radio wednesday night to 
denounce the strike as irresponsible calling it an act of 
abuse by both unionists and businessmen 
this government is going to remain firm in its direction this 
government is a strong government it has immense power which it 
is going to use he said without elaborating 
labor minister jorge triaca said if an agreement between drivers 
and bus owners was not reached wednesday he would order compulsory 
arbitration during which drivers must work the union said it would 
continue the strike 
on tuesday drivers parked their buses at intersections in this 
densely populated city of 10 million deflated the tires and walked 
away many had just been paid and were angry at how little they 
received 
a strike by signalmen on commuter train lines was declared 
illegal by the ministry and teachers who boycotted classes last 
month were docked pay university professors doctors court clerks 
and public employees in many provinces have staged strikes to 
demand more pay 
menems tough labor policies run counter to his peronist partys 
traditional backing for organized labor which was a base for his 
electoral support 
organized labor in this heavily unionized south american nation 
of 31 million claims menem is forcing workers to bear the brunt of 
sacrifices the government says are essential to curtail chronic 
inflation and the massive deficits of companies run by the state 
bus drivers who were paid about 86 for october are demanding 
32 more and a base pay of 139 for november and december 
bus owners are offering a monthly pay of about 100 through 
march 
the government brought inflation down to 56 percent last month 
from 197 percent in july by devaluation massive increases in 
public service rates and wage and price guidelines it is offering 
an increase of 16 a month to public employees 
projecting inflation at a steady 2 percent a month beginning in 
november government officials have told private businesses that 
any increase higher than 15 percent through march may not be added 
to prices 
employees at the state oil and telephone companies anticipating 
layoffs and wage cuts have protested menems privatization plans 
that aim to attract foreign investment and reduce the national 
budget deficit 
collective wage bargaining with metal workers perhaps the 
countrys strongest and best paid union has stalled and unions 
representing the majority of employees at public ministries walked 
out of contract talks two weeks ago 
groups representing industrial and farm groups meanwhile have 
complained of a pending tax increase and the reduction of tariff 
barriers that would expose their products to foreign competition

official documents traced by an american 
researcher show britain and the united states blocked the trials of 
hundreds of italian world war ii criminals according to a 
television documentary wednesday night 
the collusion prompted by fears of unsettling italys postwar 
anticommunist government meant about 800 italians listed by the 
un war crimes commission escaped trial the british broadcasting 
corp program said 
most were wanted for atrocities in yugoslavia during occupation 
by the italian army which was allied in the conflict with germany 
from 1939 to 1943 and in ethiopia 
the suspects included marshal pietro badoglio leader of the 
italian administration formed after the fall of fascist dictator 
benito mussolini in 1943 italy then changed sides in the war 
ethiopia pressed for badoglio to be tried on charges of ordering 
the use of poison gas and bombing red cross hospitals after italy 
invaded the east african territory in 1936 
one british document showed the foreign office countered in a 
1945 memorandum that badoglio had rendered valuable assistance to 
the allies 
badoglio who died in 1956 was never tried 
among the yugoslav charges were that italian soldiers set up 
concentration camps in which hundreds of people died and that 
serbian moslem and croatian units under italian control murdered 
prisoners of war 
the program titled the fascist legacy a pledge betrayed 
was based mainly on documents traced by an american researcher and 
graduate of the city university of new york michael palumbo 
palumbo said he assembled the material on the italians from 
documents in the public records office in london in the un war 
crimes commission files and in the us national archives in 
washington 
these documents show that the british and american allies had 
engaged in a policy of stalling deceiving and blocking the 
extradition of hundreds of italian war criminals who they knew were 
guilty of enormous atrocities in africa and the balkans he said 
on the program 
a spokesman at the italian embassy said the ambassador boris 
biancheri had protested to the bbc about the program on grounds it 
singled out italy 
documents quoted on the program indicated british and us 
officials accepted the listed italians were guilty but in the 
words of one foreign office document prosecutions would be 
politically embarrassing 
justice requires the handing over of these people said a 
document quoted on the program as being signed by an official of 
the war crimes sections of the foreign office ra beaumont 
expediency i fear militates against it or at least the handing 
over of some highly placed ones 
a 1946 us report from the combined civil affairs committee of 
the combined chiefs of staff stated the claims of the yugoslav 
government that offenses of the type charged were in fact committee 
is corroborated by reports of the office of strategic services the 
predecessor of the cia 
other memorandum quoted include a british foreign office report 
that the state department considers that the best action for both 
governments would be to attempt to stall

harold pinters plays have sometimes bewildered 
theatergoers his newest and shortest mountain language will 
horrify some and mystify nobody its a denunciation of 
totalitarianism 
in 20 minutes and a few stark scenes a police state is shown 
squashing individuals 
mountain language opened wednesday at the offbroadway csc 
theater its paired with the birthday party one of pinters 
earliest plays from the late 1950s 
women in black winter coats stand along a bleak brick wall as 
theatergoers enter one of them played by wendy makkena says they 
were told to arrive at 9 am and its now 5 pm another woman 
played by jean stapleton is admitted to a prison to visit her son 
she tries to tell him she has brought him bread and apples a guard 
forbids her to use her mountain language the only one she knows 
for her attempts to use it he beats her son during a stage 
blackout and she dies of shock 
makkena sees her husband a sack over his head held by two 
guards recordings play their thoughts of springtime at a lake 
its my right to see my husband she says a guard throws her 
to the floor she has no rights 
the birthday party is fortunate in having stapleton to play 
meg as a frowsy dim housewife who sounds like her edith bunker 
in tvs all in the family but actually is very different 
stapleton is hilarious she makes serving her husband corn flakes a 
true comic turn 
are they nice she asks her husband 
yes they are responds bill moor her perfect foil 
he also gives his character some spine and dignity in an attempt 
to stand up to two bullies who obviously have might on their side 
two men arrive and menace stanley the couples boarder played 
grayfaced and timid by david strathairn the sense of fear the 
audience feels comes from not knowing why stanley is being 
threatened or even if its deserved 
richard riehle plays mccann the thug of the pair who indicates 
that perhaps stanley has defected from the ira stanley knows 
immediately why theyre there 
peter riegert plays mccanns boss whose smoothly civilized 
speech is meant to mask the deeper evil riegert diminishes the 
plays sense of fear and dread by not making his evil believable 
stapleton makes up for it by making act 1 remarkably funny this 
doesnt overbalance the play it makes a strong contrast between 
mundane but valuable everyday life and existence in the terrible 
shadow of force 
pinter wrote mountain language and the birthday party 
three decades apart its obvious they are related theyre 
directed by carey perloff artistic director of csc

the victims of laurie danns shooting rampage can 
go forward with their lawsuit against her parents a judge ruled 
wednesday saying the couple may be partly responsible for their 
daughters violent behavior 
ms dann stormed an elementary school in north suburban winnetka 
in may 1988 and fired on a secondgrade classroom fatally wounding 
8yearold nicholas corwin and five other children 
she wounded a seventh person at a nearby house where she 
barricaded herself before killing herself 
circuit judge donald oconnells ruling wednesday denied a 
motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by nicholas parents and others 
charging that ms danns parents norman and edith wasserman were 
negligent 
the suit alleges the wassermans who lived in glencoe at the 
time but now live in florida knew their daughter was dangerous but 
failed to get her help 
the suit says that although the couple knew their daughter had a 
history of violence they failed to take away guns she owned gave 
misleading information to her psychologist and helped her get an 
illegal experimental drug for her emotional problems 
the judge said that if the allegations are true there is 
evidence the wassermans were not just merely permitting her to 
pose a risk to society 
we are dealing with allegations of a continuing course of 
conduct that fostered ongoing violent aberrant conduct on the part 
of laurie dann oconnell said 
he noted allegations in the lawsuit that the couple knew about 
the possession of arms and ammunition in fact they fostered that 
by providing money for her to buy them 
he also noted allegations that the wassermans were aware of 
reports that ms dann had stabbed her exhusband and complaints 
that she had made death threats against other people 
in refusing to dismiss the case the judge rejected arguments by 
defense attorney robert l reifenberg that the wassermans had 
neither the ability nor the legal authority to control their adult 
daughter 
there was nothing that the wassermans could have done legally 
to remove those firearms reifenberg said he said they would 
have had to steal them 
if the wassermans acted to somehow confine laurie dann or 
constrain her against her will the wassermans could under a 
certain set of circumstances be liable for false imprisonment 
reifenberg said 
hospitals jails and penal institutions have the expertise to 
control a violent person he said the same cannot be said for 
the wassermans 
the attorney for danns victims said the defense was really 
missing the point 
its precisely because the wassermans are not strangers not 
institutions that they didnt need guards to take control said 
al hofeld 
he said that because of the parentchild relationship the 
wassermans were in a position to do things that institutions may 
not be able to accomplish because they deal with people at an arms 
length 
it was the second time that oconnell turned away an attempt by 
the wassermans to have the case dismissed 
the couple didnt attend wednesdays hearing the judge has 
ordered them to appear in chicago by middecember to give 
depositions in the case

kitty dukakis struggling with alcoholism and 
chemical dependency was hospitalized because she drank a small 
amount of rubbing alcohol and experienced a severe reaction 
her doctor disclosed wednesday 
gerald plotkin said in a statement that the wife of gov michael 
dukakis said she swallowed the liquid in a state of exhaustion 
with flu symptoms and depression 
he did not comment on whether or not she was knowingly trying to 
hurt herself 
mindy lubber the governors spokeswoman said she believed the 
dukakis family had removed all alcoholic beverages from their home 
after mrs dukakis entered a treatment program for alcoholism last 
february 
plotkin said the family and mrs dukakis were deciding what 
steps to take next 
plotkin who said mrs dukakis had been taking antidepressants 
prescribed by her psychiatrist was completely out of danger 
tests indicated no other drugs or alcoholic beverages were 
involved he said 
susan kaplan another spokeswman for the governor was asked if 
the incident amounted to a suicide attempt she said all i can 
tell you is that you can read the statement she also would not 
say how much rubbing alcohol mrs dukakis had ingested 
kitty has suffered from chemical dependency and struggled with 
depression for many years these two problems often are related 
autumn has been a particularly bad season for her said plotkin 
rubbing alcohol is most commonly sold as isopropyl alcohol 
according to alan woolf director of the massachusetts poison 
center at childrens hospital in boston it is more toxic than 
ethanol alcohol which is in liquor and is irritating to the 
stomach 
about 10 ounces of rubbing alcohol which often contains about 
70 percent isopropyl alcohol could be lethal woolf said 
a woman who answered the phone at the alcohol abuse 24hour 
hotline said it was not uncommon for people with drinking problems 
to drink rubbing alcohol if nothing else was available 
usually its somebody with a severe alcohol problem said 
the woman who declined to give her name theyll drink anything 
even hairspray 
mrs dukakis was brought by ambulance monday night to brigham 
and womens hospital complaining of what a spokeswoman said were 
flulike symptoms 
she was admitted to the intensive care unit and underwent tests 
tuesday one year to the day after her husband lost his 
presidential bid she was admitted to the intensive care unit but 
moved wednesday to a private room 
plotkin on tuesday refused to answer many questions about her 
condition 
the governor spent monday and tuesday with his wife canceled 
all appointments but also refused comment 
the health of mrs dukakis who turns 53 on dec 26 is of 
intense interest because of a high visibility she has never 
avoided her ready disclosures about her addictions to pills and 
alcohol were applauded as courageous and refreshing 
during her husbands run for the white house mrs dukakis 
underwent neck surgery then a week before the presidential 
election she entered a minneapolis hospital suffering fever and 
chills 
earlier this year she underwent four weeks of treatment for 
alcoholism she has previously admitted to a 26year addiction to 
diet pills 
the dukakises were married june 20 1963 and have always lived 
in suburban brookline the couple has three grown children and a 
granddaughter 
dukakis 86yearold mother euterpe dukakis also was 
hospitalized monday she was in satisfactory condition wednesday at 
beth israel hospital where she was admitted monday after a bout of

the us semiconductor industry is reeling 
from foreign competitors who are trying to gain a choke hold on the 
materials and equipment needed to make computer chips an industry 
executive told congress on wednesday 
are we going to sit by and allow foreign competitors to 
control our destiny in such a critical industry asked robert 
noyes chief executive officer of sematech 
the equipment and materials industry in this country is 
falling prey to targeted efforts by foreign competitors determined 
to control the supply lines the manufacturing and the end 
products noyes said 
he did not name specific competitors he had in mind 
noyes told a joint hearing of two house science subcommittees 
that while the united states has a 40 percent share of the 
worldwide semiconductor market its hold on the markets for 
critical equipment and materials is below that 
sematech is a governmentsupported consortium of 14 companies 
established two years ago to help the us computer chip industry 
compete in the world market congress gave sematech 100 million in 
each of the last two years and committees in both houses have 
recommended paying the same amount for 1990 
in his testimony before the subcommittees rep mel levine 
dcalif blamed the handsoff business policies of the bush 
administration for the decline of the nations hightech industries 
the american people have entrusted the president with the 
economic health of our nation levine said trampling that 
trust by quietly sabotaging americas major hightechnology 
initiatives is a national disgrace

the veterans department has made available 
surplus medical equipment to president bushs special envoy to 
vietnam for use in that country the department said wednesday 
night 
the united states agreed two years ago to ease the way for 
private groups with expertise in artificial limbs to help 
vietnamese war victims 
that agreement was in return for hanois help on resolving the 
question of what happened to missing us servicemen and recovering 
remains of those killed in the war there are 2331 us servicemen 
unaccounted for according to the defense department 
the envoy retired army gen john vessey a former chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff made his second trip to vietnam in 
october and reported to bush on monday the president noted on 
tuesday that vessey had reported a stepped up spirit of 
cooperation in terms of accounting for remains on the part of 
vietnamese leaders 
on monday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush was 
looking forward to progress on the mia issue and other 
humanitarian concerns 
don smith a veterans department spokesman said some veterans 
groups had expressed fear that us veterans hospitals might be 
deprived of needed equipment in a time of financial stringency 
but i think that stems from a misunderstanding 
all equipment being turned over to vessey is surplus and first 
has been offered to installations throughout the veterans 
department system and to other government agencies smith said the 
original cost of the items involved was about 250000 but the 
monetary value today would be much less if any at all remains he 
said 
though the 1987 agreement was aimed at artificial limbs and 
similar prosthetic devices i dont think theres much of that in 
there said smith 
from the list of items being made available to vessey smith 
said he remembered defibrillators used to restore normal heartbeat 
in certain cardiac emergencies and xray equipment 
if this can help gen vessey make progress on the mia issue i 
cant imagine the most hardbitten vietnam veteran having a problem 
with it smith said 
he said he did not know what arrangements vessey had made for 
delivery

a federal judge wednesday denied a petition to free 
anticastro militant orlando bosch whom the justice department is 
trying to deport as miamis no 1 terrorist 
but us district judge william m hoeveler ordered that bosch 
not be expelled while his attorneys exhaust their appeals of the 
extradition order made by the justice department in june 
bosch considered by some exiles a hero of the anticastro 
struggle has been held at the federal metropolitan correctional 
center south of miami since february 1988 when he returned to the 
united states from venezuela 
this order concludes another chapter in the sad odyssey of 
orlando bosch avila hoeveler wrote in a 12page ruling once a 
hero of cuban resistance to castros communist takeover his 
efforts became sullied by his extremes and eventually resulted in 
his imprisonment 
bosch was convicted of a 1968 bazooka attack on a polish ship in 
miami and fled the us while on probation in 1974 he was later 
jailed for 11 years in venezuela in the bombing of a cuban 
airliner killing 73 people but he was never convicted in the 
attack 
according to cia documents released by the justice department 
the 62yearold cuban doctor ran successful bombing raids in cuba 
in the early 1960s us intelligence reports have linked bosch to 
terrorist bombings throughout the us and latin america into the 
1970s and he is regarded by the fbi as miamis no 1 terrorist 
but his attorneys say that bosch now repudiates violence and 
his family believes hell be killed if he is deported 
some prominent cuban americans have asked president bush to 
intervene but the white house has said it wont comment on the 
bosch case while its in the courts 
boschs attorney raul cantero planned continuing the legal 
battle saying i think its an issue we can win its up to the 
family to decide whether they want to go through the aggravation of 
another few months litigating this 
but boschs daughter myriam left the court in tears 
hes a pediatrician she said of her father hes a lover 
of people and this is how this country pays him back

do well when compared with adults of all age groups in the 10 
nations where the test was given

mbali umoja wrote her first poem when she was 
8 years old her inspiration the brownies 
we had to draw some kind of springtime picture and instead of 
drawing a picture i wrote a poem about the spring she said 
but she just as easily could have drawn the picture because 
umoja who has a degree in theater from the california institute of 
the arts in los angeles is an art therapist at the philadelphia 
child guidance clinic 
as an artist her influences vary her office reflects 
multiethnic culture with displays of african musical instruments and 
ceramic sculptures created by her young patients 
we are all citizens of the world umoja said we write 
about our whole life experiences 
in one of her works messing with a poet is a dangerous 
thing which she wrote for her former husband aschak she writes 
when youve just got to bug someone 
and dont know who 
grab a dancer 
or a painter 
but leave the lover of oral expression be 
the 33yearold umoja grew up in elkins park pa as elmyra 
bell she changed her name while a student in los angeles 
as a child she was surrounded by books her parents are ed bell 
a university of pennsylvania graduate and former philadelphia eagle 
and barbara bell the head psychiatric nurse at temple university 
hospital 
literature was a major part of my environment umoja said 
my mother grew up in the segregated south and went through a 
segregated school system which opened her up to the experience of 
black literature she used to give my father lists of books to pick 
up during his travels around the country and they would read them 
to us 
the language of poetry always touched me my mom can read it 
really well and it was the written word that related to me 
writers who early influenced her were langston hughes and maya 
angelou but it was paul laurence dunbars sympathy that really 
reached her 
it made sense to me when i was about 11 years old she says 
i was reading it for what could have been the 50th time and it 
suddenly made me cry i really felt it that was the first time i 
knew that poetry could do more than just sound good that it had an 
impact that couldnt die 
her poetic direction eventually came from ntozake shange author 
of for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow 
is enuf which won a tony award in 1977 for the plays star 
trazana beverley 
she took the womans perspective umoja said she finally 
started speaking honestly in the face of monumental criticism to 
what our lives are as women 
shanges writing also taught umoja what it means to be a female 
artist 
youre fighting all the way she said whether youre black 
or white or asian chicano it doesnt make any difference 
umoja whose works have appeared in such anthologies as poets 
on the move often wonders what it would be like to be a socalled 
normal person one who experiences life as it relates to themselves 
rather than as it relates to the greater human experience 
it would be easier not to be as strong as i am she says 
instead of functioning as a technicolor character in a 
blackandwhite world thats how it feels to be me 
as a high school student umoja works were strident and bitter 
reflecting her rage and the politics of the time one such poem 
america the beautiful was written in 1972 
america 
the stench of blood is in the air 
everywhere 
the heat of hate is rising fast 
a shot for the moon a kick in my ass 
kent state students dead 
sadistic pigs busting heads 
helping me well thats a bunch of bull 
but this is america yeah the beautiful 
her writing has mellowed somewhat since then now she struggles 
with issues many women understand safety loneliness making ends 
meet and concern for americas children 
i cant believe how we treat children in this country she 
said we need to stop being afraid of our children and make a 
difference with them she writes of women as mothers as 
individuals and as they relate to men one poem widow madness 
was written after a close male friend died but it became a tribute 
to all women who have lost a loved one 
in the poem a woman thinks of her husband long after his death 
she was two years past those cravings 
past the late night phone call smothering cold of deaths hand 
in her face 
life went on 
but later the woman dreams of the night she learned of her 
husbands death 
she never saw 
only smelled the blur of wide shoulders interrupt her search 
never heard a strangled cry 
she only remembered the french quarter aroma 
wafting from his collar 
she climbed his back 
clung hotly to a memory

in a year marked by a hurricane in the east and a 
severe earthquake on the west coast many americans are coming face 
to face with the intricacies of the tax laws covering casualty 
losses 
and countless others who were spared any damage this time might 
well be pausing to consider the situation they would face if they 
are less lucky in some future calamity 
the federal income tax system contains provisions for relief 
among taxpayers who suffer losses from casualties or theft but the 
benefits are limited and not as generous as they used to be 
most people with casualty losses are surprised and disappointed 
by the tax rules says the accounting firm of ernst amp young 
before the tax code was repeatedly overhauled in the 1980s 
taxpayers could deduct all the personalproperty losses they could 
document from sudden or unpredictable events such as fire storm 
theft or riot minus any insurance claims paid 
the only limit was the exclusion of the first 100 in losses from 
each casualty a measure intended to keep minor cases out of the 
system 
now however a taxpayers total casualty loss for the year 
after subtracting the first 100 in each individual event does not 
qualify for any deduction until it exceeds 10 percent of adjusted 
gross income for the year 
so for a taxpayer making 35000 a 4000 loss would produce 
only a 400 deduction 
another primary sticking point the deductible loss for property 
stolen or destroyed cannot exceed your orginal cost of acquiring it 
plus any improvements made over the years 
you cannot claim the market value of a property or collectible 
item that has appreciated in value over the years since you acquired 
it 
furthermore if you receive an insurance payment based on recent 
or present market value that exceeds your original cost of the item 
in question the difference is subject to taxation as a capital gain 
the law treats such cases as if you had sold the item at a 
profit through a transaction known legally as an involuntary 
conversion 
of course these strictures apply only to the question of taxes 
they do not take into account any government or private assistance 
programs that may provide relief for your loss 
for example in places that are designated by the government as 
federal disaster areas people with casualty losses can file claims 
for deductions against their taxes for the year preceding the loss 
this is aimed at giving them a chance to seek refunds immediately 
in order to have funds available as soon as possible for rebuilding 
or replacement of their lost assets 
some misfortunes are ineligible for casualty loss deductions 
for instance damage caused over time by insects rust rot or 
exposure to the elements 
also ruled out are any losses deemed to be caused by your own 
willful negligence 
even in a case where you have an eligible deduction to claim 
experts on the subject caution you often need to take steps to 
demonstrate its legitimacy 
thus they say it helps to establish that a theft has probably 
been committed if you file a police report soon after an item is 
determined to be missing 
says the jk lasser institute in its annual publication your 
income tax if your return is audited you will have to prove that 
the casualty occurred and the amount of the loss the time to 
collect your evidence is as soon after the casualty as possible

playing fictional police roles on television 
is one thing but theres an added responsibility in portraying a 
reallife detective says actor a martinez who stars in nbcs 
manhunt search for the night stalker 
martinez who was born adolph but shortened his name to a 
appears in the movie about the killer who terrorized california 
between march and august 1985 he plays gil carrillo a detective 
for the los angeles county sheriffs department richard jordan is 
frank salerno another detective 
ive played other cops on police story and on the whiz 
kids said martinez its just different when its someone you 
get to meet and form opinions of it puts a responsibility on you 
its difficult to uphold when the piece is not a character study 
i found myself wishing i could expand on a scene so i could 
show more of the man 
manhunt search for the night stalker will be telecast 
sunday it ends with the arrest of richard ramirez who was 
convicted on sept 20 of 13 murders five attempted murders 11 
sexual assaults and 14 burglaries the jurys recommendation he be 
sent to the gas chamber was affirmed by the trial judge tuesday 
its really the story of the investigation said martinez 
who also has a starring role on nbcs santa barbara 
martinez said he developed a great respect and admiration for 
carrillo hes remarkable because he remains warmhearted in a 
dehumanizing job where he is constantly in the face of human 
behavior at its worse he said its difficult to imagine myself 
handling such a challenge so gracefully 
my favorite part of the picture was when i could show gils 
personal life and his family he was a victim too because he was 
separated from his family i sense a lot of pain in him over that 
its fascinating the way he bears it 
martinez who has two children said in particular he identified 
with carrillos empathy for children 
the night stalker harmed a lot of children directly or 
indirectly he said that aspect stood out in bold relief 
martinez was interviewed in his dressing room for santa 
barbara which he joined within a week of its debut in 1984 he 
plays cruz castillo a private detective 
cruz castillo is the hero whos in love with a woman from the 
other side of the tracks he said the character was recently 
married to the soap operas heroine from a wealthy family eden 
capwell who is played by marcy walker 
martinez took off four weeks from santa barbara to work on 
the night stalker movie during that period however he still 
managed to appear in 10 episodes 
an hour show five days a week is an intensive grind said 
martinez who appears in almost every show its a small cast so 
the core people tend to work a lot even being away for a weekend 
tends to upset the rhythm of the show sometimes the fatigue is your 
ally because you dont have the excess energy to get nervous 
he also costars with meryl streep roseanne barr and ed begley 
jr in the feature film she devil he plays streeps gigolo 
lover while on location in port jefferson ny his wife leslie 
bryans gave birth to their daughter devon they also have a son 
dakota lee called cody 
martinez the son of a school principal grew up in los angeles 
as the third generation adolph martinez as a child he was known as 
little a and abone the name was later shortened to a 
he got into acting while at ucla he made his professional debut 
in the movie born wild and had roles in other films he was a 
regular in such series as cassie amp co and the whiz kids 
the bulk of my work has been in hispanic or native american 
roles he said but within that ive played characters from 
professionals to illiterates its a privilege to make your living 
as an artist 
now that im a father my desire for cinematic grandeur has 
washed away the irony is that for years i was afraid to have kids 
because i was afraid it would be an albatross around my neck its 
amazing that the thing you feared is what liberates you

a helpwanted sign is going out for the 1990s 
expected to be a decade of great change in the united states this 
is one of a periodic series of articles the 90s looking ahead 
to the promise and peril of the upcoming 10 years in the 
environment medicine technology and society 
</TEXT>

fewer and fewer people will be entering the 
us job market in the 1990s and the dwindling flow will change the 
face of the factory and office and of american society in the 
coming decade 
women and minoritygroup members will account for over 80 percent 
of all new entrants in the labor force in the 90s says the private 
population reference bureau 
in the 1970s 241 million young people entered the workforce in 
this decade only 180 million did so and in the 1990s according 
to a bureau study the number is expected to decline to 156 
million much of the dropoff is among nonhispanic white males 
the coming change in the labor force will follow a decade the 
1980s of significant social transformation in the united states 
lifestyle changes likely to continue through the coming 10 years 
because improved medical care has extended lifespans the 
americans who greet the year 2000 will be on average older and if 
not wiser at least bettereducated than the ones who saw the 
current century arrive other lifestyle trends people are marrying 
later and divorcing more and women have become an important part of 
the workplace 
forecasting into the next century carol j de vita a senior 
researcher at the population reference bureau says technology may 
solve part of the labor dilemma by eliminating the need for some 
jobs 
but many millions of new workers will still be needed and 
employers may have to turn to older people or immigrants de vita 
explained in an interview 
some businesses such as fastfood outlets are already feeling 
the pinch and have begun seeking out retired people to fill jobs 
many of the jobs that younger workers do are entry level so 
the question is if someone with more experience would want to switch 
and gain some new skills she said 
a second choice for laborshort companies may be immigration if 
foreign workers can be found with needed skills 
in fact de vita noted some bills have been introduced in 
congress to shift the focus and give foreign workers with desired 
skills rather than those with relatives in the united states 
higher priority for immigration 
the growth of the us population is expected to slow in the 90s 
americans of the giant postworld war ii baby boom generation are 
now becoming parents producing a relatively large number of 
offspring 
the boomers were followed by a baby bust generation in the 
late 1960s and 1970s as this group reaches its childbearing years 
during the 1990s fewer potential parents will mean fewer offspring 
unless the bust generation sharply reverses the trend of recent 
decades during which people have postponed childbearing and 
eventually had smaller families than in years past 
the us census bureau notes that the elderly constitute the 
fastestgrowing group in the national population 
as of 1987 there were 298 million americans age 65 or older 
122 percent of the population the census bureau says this group 
will continue growing into the next century and will include one 
american in five when the bulk of the baby boom generation has 
seniorcitizen status by about the year 2030 census projections 
show the elderly to be the only group to continue growing through 
the middle of the next century 
the boom in elderly will have a critical impact on health care 
and retirementincome programs observes the population reference 
bureau study but it also will provide more older candidates for the 
jobs de vita sees going begging because of the decline in the number 
of young workers 
meanwhile the traditional family of working husband and 
wife staying home with the children has largely disappeared fewer 
than half of all families now have children even in families that 
have offspring most mothers held jobs outside the home as of 1987 
the census bureau reports 
at the same time the population reference bureau noted the 
growing incidence of divorce and outofwedlock births has fueled an 
enormous increase in singleparent families 
almost one in four children now lives with only one parent 
compared with one in 10 in 1960 the population reference bureau 
found the growing concern over child care elder care and 
parental leave will continue well into next century it concluded 
the census bureau reports that blacks now constitute 122 percent 
of americans and hispanics 8 percent meaning these two groups 
account for about one in five americans 
by 2000 nearly onethird of all schoolage children will be 
from minority populations a situation that presents a major 
challenge to our school systems the population reference bureau 
reports 
the growth of minority groups like the change in the face of the 
workforce will present society with further new challenges in the 
economy in politics and in the legal system where affirmative 
action and related issues may become still more pressing

it was frontpage news when the managing 
editor of the key west citizen annouced he was retiring after 
testing positive for aids 
jim tucci who started 12 years ago as a reporter at the local 
daily newspaper is one of the more visible aids stories to hit this 
sunny tourist mecca but key west famed for a relaxed relatively 
carefree lifestyle is coping with one of the nations highest aids 
rates 
despite signs that a spiraling number of aids cases has taken a 
heavy toll on health service providers longtime residents say 
bigger richer cities could probably learn something from this 
communitys attitude toward victims 
i think this town is a lot further ahead than others said 
gordon ross bondesen a gay entertainer at a popular resort hotel 
who has lived here nearly 20 years theres a lot of education and 
support and compassion he said 
however concerns raised in published reports on the prevalence 
of aids and on its potential impact on the tourism industry anger 
community leaders 
my only concern is the way its reported not that its here 
said don defeo president of the key west hotelmotel association 
theres a lot of competition out for the tourist dollar said 
chamber of commerce president john parks jr were more concerned 
about the hurricane situation 
yet acquired immune deficiency syndrome has had a much more 
dramatic effect on the people of key west this decade than any 
hurricane 
just 243 cases have been recorded since 1982 by the monroe county 
public health unit which covers all of the florida keys population 
about 77000 but the rate of 121 cases per 100000 people puts key 
west population 27000 in the company of such cities as san 
francisco 104 cases per 100000 new york 70 per 100000 and 
miami 47 per 100000 key west has most of the cases 
in a little town like this that much aids is relatively a 
lot said dave nolan the health units statistician 
one reason for the high rate is a large gay population which has 
a higher incidence of aids some victims diagnosed elsewhere also 
move here raising concern about limited resources being strained 
i think anyone can understand our concern that people whove 
contracted aids elsewhere and are looking for a sympathetic 
community will think of key west but there is a point where the 
community will be stretched to the limit said mayor richard 
heyman 
however the greater concern for the future is new cases arising 
from drug abuse nolan said like everybody else in the country 
we have drug problems and where there are drugs aids follows 
how prepared key west is to handle a surge in new cases is 
uncertain but one doctor who sees most of the aids patients at his 
private practice with two other physicians says the island isnt 
ready 
the healthcare resources are not in place in this community 
as they are not in other cities said dr larry siegel this 
community is not yet prepared to deal with large numbers of new 
patients 
the spiraling costs for aidsrelated medical care already have 
had a dramatic impact at florida keys memorial hospital the 
countys only public hospital during the last fiscal year it 
absorbed 1 million in unpaid bills left by aids patients 
accounting for about onethird of its bad debt that figure was up 
sharply from the previous year hospital administrator donald mayer 
said 
one aids patient who died recently left a 150000 bill for a 
45day stay mayer said lee brooks was diagnosed hivpositive in 
miami in 1981 and moved to key west five years ago to run a guest 
house the 36yearold man died in march without medical insurance 
after spending the last nine months of his life at the hospital 
according to a published report 
lack of state and federal dollars is a key problem said heyman 
adding that key wests size puts it at a disadvantage in competing 
for financing with cities like miami were having to do more on 
less he said 
much of the burden for helping aids patients with basic needs has 
fallen on local groups such as aids help which help with rent 
food and medication 
the focus also has been put on education with monthly safesex 
workshops brochures and condoms distributed at gay bars and free 
condoms provided at guest houses among other programs 
a mobile testing van believed to be the first in the state will 
soon hit the streets to provide safesex education and conduct aids 
tests said norene sofranac director of the aids prevention center 
which is run by the state department of health and rehabilitative 
services 
bondesen who has lost 30 friends to aids said the epidemic has 
made the gay community more sexually responsible and resulted in a 
solid support network for aids victims there isnt a sense of 
gloom but more a sense of determination to educate people about 
aids he said 
tony tarracino 73 a saloon operator in the old town section 
said key west is a survivor and will carry on as usual despite what 
is perceived as negative media coverage of aids here 
we always seem to overcome said tarracino who was elected 
mayor on nov 7

clink charley hummel drops a nickel into the 
jukebox 
plonk he taps c1 
whir the platter twists onto the turntable 
wham its 1958 and great balls of fire jerry lee lewis is 
on the loose 
you shake my nerves and you rattle my brain too much loving 
drives a man insane you took my will oh what a thrill goodness 
gracious great balls of fire 
hummel an excop with a ruddy boyish face stares fondly at his 
1961 rockola regis 200 which has the sleek chrome lines of a 57 
chevy for a moment hes transported back to his junior year of 
high school the gang is together at the neighborhood bowling alley 
then he snaps back and while the killer wreaks aural havoc from 
behind the rockolas blue metal grill hummel discusses the 100th 
birthday of that most american of inventions the jukebox 
an amateur historian professional tinkerer and jukebox wizard 
hummel has determined that the first jukebox swallowed its first 
coin on nov 23 1889 at the palais royale saloon in san francisco 
it didnt much resemble its flashy descendants nor did it have 
the same name it was called a nickelintheslot but the 
operating principle was pretty much the same when a nickel was 
dropped into a slot a wax cylinder began to spin a needle plopped 
onto it and music blared into crude headphones 
the songs were about two minutes long and there was only one 
selection per machine but it was recorded music and the sound 
quality was surprisingly good 
hummel collects jukeboxes and the family room of his suburban 
home is a combination warehouse workshop and museum crammed 
walltowall with vintage jukes wax cylinders 78 and 45rpm 
records advertising signs and a bronze bust of the father of 
recorded music thomas alva edison the collection includes a 
turnofthecentury nickelintheslot that still works when a penny 
is dropped in prices were slashed from a nickel in the 1890s 
slipping in a penny hummel hands over the headphones and a 
listener hears the imperial strains of columbia gem of the 
ocean screech through the rubber tubes 
its beyond our age we really cant recall these but these 
are really dynamite pieces these early nickelintheslots 
hummel says people couldnt afford a phonograph yet for a nickel 
they could go out to a tavern or an arcade and settle into a nice 
song they remembered 
elvis hadnt been born yet so 19th century hitmakers made do 
with what was available one early favorite nearer my god to 
thee 
the word jukebox apparently entered the language in the 
1920s the random house dictionary of the english language traces it 
to jukehouse a southern dialect word for brothel which in turn 
came from a west african word dzugu meaning wicked 
americans embraced the wicked machines 
the modern jukebox was born in 1927 when automatic music 
instrument co made a machine that had amplified sound and played a 
variety of selections it still looked oldfashioned like an old 
wooden radio but it set the stage for the heyday of the jukebox in 
the 1930s 40s and 50s 
those were the years when wurlitzer seeburg rockola and other 
companies competed to create the brightest flashiest most 
multicolored and spectacular jukes imaginable 
jukeboxes became an integral part of the american experience 
particularly the experience of teenagers flush with burgers and the 
first stirrings of romance 
it was a time when perry como crooned of his jukebox baby 
all your lunchtime money goes down the slot you could live on air 
if the musics hot jukebox baby youre the swingingest doll in 
town 
jukeboxes hit an artistic peak in the postwar years when 
wurlitzer came out with its model 1015 regarded by many aficionados 
as the most beautiful jukebox of all time it was wrapped in a 
rainbow of multicolored plastic tubing was trimmed with pieces of 
art deco chrome played 24 songs and sounded sublime it was an 
american classic 
the war was over there were happy times observes don 
fairchild who runs the juke box hall of fame in oklahoma city 
money was more plentiful jobs were opening up and people were 
getting out and listening to the jukeboxes 
and along came something else rock n roll 
its no coincidence that the most popular jukeboxes at 
fairchilds hall of fame are those that were in use during the 50s 
it was a golden age when music and machine united in a marriage 
made in teen heaven

fairchild recalls growing up in tishomingo okla during the 
50s 
if you was going with a girl it seemed like the songs they had 
back then it seemed like every song was written about you and that 
girl all them by elvis fats domino doing blueberry hill the 
coasters doing searchin and young blood whoo they had some 
good artists back then 
charley hummel remembers too 
i mean god i can remember the 50s we used to listen to 
elvis all the time on the jukebox it was super and the 
penguins clyde mcphatter the tokens a lot of those rampb songs 
we used to blast them 
normally kids werent supposed to know where the volume 
control was but we all knew where it was in the back and you just 
took your little screwdriver and you just slowly slowly cranked it 
up 
to demonstrate hummel leans behind his 1961 rockola and makes 
an adjustment then slips a coin in the slot a drum beat sounds and 
chubby checker blasts out a song from the year the jukebox was built 
come on lets twist again like we did last summer lets twist 
again like we did last year woo woo woo woo remember when we 
were really hummin yeah lets twist again twistin time is 
here 
that was one of the last good years for the jukebox industry the 
industry estimates that 43000 new jukeboxes were shipped to 
customers in 1955 and 42000 in 1960 by 1965 the numbers had 
slipped to 29000 by 1975 17000 and by the mid80s 10000 to 
12000 
jukeboxes were challenged by home stereos shunned by fastfood 
driveins and threatened with obsolescence by the compact disc and 
the decline of the 45rpm single 
theres been a modest revival in the past few years in part the 
industry has adapted producing jukeboxes that play cds and music 
videos in part it is because people yearn for the old times and 
are buying nostalgic recreations of the old jukeboxes 
i would say it is going to continue to increase because you are 
incorporating new technologies into it which is attracting new 
audiences says fred newton of the chicagobased amusement amp music 
operators association a trade group the oldies thing is going 
to continue 
not surprisingly hummel is bullish as well 
i think there is a market especially for the cds the cds are 
high quality and hightech thats what the public wants they want 
good music and thats what the jukebox has been doing for 100 years 
its been getting better quality better sound and better 
reliability so there is a place for the cds 
still he says he hopes the record industry continues to produce 
45s 
as he speaks hummel drops another nickel into his jukebox 
this is one of my favorites he says percy faith theme from 
a summer place 
the music wells up 
you see i can remember from when i was a kid its a little 
flashback me and my ife you know a 57 chevy maybe riding down a 
highway listening to something like this 
the song unabashedly romantic fills the house hummels wife 
begins to dance lightly around the living room looking for all the 
world like a teenager gearing up for the high school dance he 
lovingly looks at her and smiles 
charley hummel is suddenly 17 years old and very very happy

one of the hottest books circulating in the 
nations capital these days isnt available in any store and youre 
unlikely to get your hands on a copy unless you have a friend in 
congress or at the cia 
the book is a bootleg translation of the japan that can say 
no coauthored by sony corp founder akio morita and shintaro 
ishihara a novelist and rightwing diet member of japans ruling 
liberal democratic party 
the rhetoric isnt what americans are used to hearing from their 
japanese allies the book characterizes the usjapanese 
relationship as a fatal attraction 
morita writes that america is in an economic malaise because it 
thinks only about the next 10 minutes not the next 10 years as 
japan does 
ishihara calls the united states a shifty country and says if 
it doesnt start playing more by japanese rules tokyo might stop 
selling it the microchips essential for targeting us missiles and 
begin selling them to the soviets 
congressional aides say translations produced by us 
intelligence and defense agencies have been spreading like wildfire 
through house and senate office buildings 
i think this is the first time that these kinds of attitudes 
have been publicly expressed sen james exon said in an interview 
in his office as he clutched a copy 
exon dneb described the japanese as very shrewd business 
people and who are very clever in promoting the interests of 
japan he said he is worried that the book outlines a plan that 
theyve had for a long time 
like exon rep don ritter rpa also has a well markedup copy 
of the 74page translation ritter said his initial reaction was 
youve got to be kidding 
he said he is especially troubled by ishiharas description of 
us forces in japan as mad dogs and his declaration that japan 
should spurn further us military assistance 
mr ishihara sounds a little like some of the japanese 
ultraright politicians ultranationalist politicians prior to the 
onset of world war ii which is somewhat disturbing ritter said 
between reciting passages from the book during an interview 
there are some important passages in the book ritter said 
especially those by morita dealing with japans success in bringing 
products to mass markets 
this part of his message has gotten lost underneath the burden 
of all these other statements and this inflammatory rhetoric 
ritter said this is a message that is awfully important for 
americans to know 
rep mel levine dcalif agrees with ritter that some of 
moritas comments were right on the mark and ishiharas words 
inaccurately reflected some of the issues between our two 
countries levine said that was why he began passing out copies of 
the book to his capitol hill colleagues 
i felt this was important levine said it was something 
that they should have the opportunity to see 
despite his role as an unofficial distributor levine said media 
accounts about congressional reaction to the book should not be 
overblown such reports filtering back to tokyo already have 
helped boost sagging sales of the book there according to the 
kobunsha publishing company 
interest is growing in washington as well 
weve had people in here every day going absolutely bananas 
looking for it said sarah wassum who works at a bookstore in the 
national press club building in washington were losing our minds 
trying to track it down 
levine emphasized that he did not commission the unofficial 
translation saying his came from the pentagon 
a congressional aide speaking on condition he not be identified 
said that the version levine obtained was translated by the defense 
advanced research projects agency and that another translation done 
by the central intelligence agency also has begun circulating in 
washington 
yet another version is making its way through californias 
silicon valley and other american high technology centers at united 
technologies corp international affairs director ellen frost and 
japan office director stanley krueger said the book expresses views 
that have been aired in japan for a long time 
it isnt so surprising frost said for congress to appear 
shocked is a measure of how little they follow japan in any kind of 
depth 
krueger said he thinks he knows why the book has received bad 
reviews in congress there is a tendency in the united states 
maybe in washington in terms of various policies toward japan to 
assume their total dependence on the united states he said 
this book puts a little chink in that armor this is the first 
time somebody in japan has said hey wait a minute we can go 
some other way 
frost a former official in the defense and commerce departments 
said congressional criticism of the book will only make things worse 
for american companies trying to penetrate japanese markets 
the more bashing that occurs as a result of things like this 
book the more those japanese who think like mr ishihara are 
inclined to cast off more on their own and throw us out she said

american consumers dramatically slowed their 
accumulation of new debt in september adding only 606 million and 
showing caution about buying cars and other expensive items 
the federal reserve board reported tuesday that consumer credit

a new round of layoffs could be coming to wall 
street as financial firms continue to be pinched by the 2yearold 
slump in the brokerage business analysts say 
shearson lehman hutton inc began laying off employees this week 
in a cutback that could total 2 percent of its work force by years 
end 
its not a problem just for shearson everybody has it said 
perrin long who follows the industry for lipper analytical 
securities corp in new york i think well be seeing several 
cutbacks but in smaller numbers to avoid a lot of media 
attention 
shearson and other wall street firms particularly retail 
brokerages catering to individual investors have been under 
increasing pressure in recent months to trim costs in the face of 
rising operating expenses 
most are expected to show a decline in trading profits this year 
due to the stock markets october plunge and the general pressure on 
takeover stocks which had been the driving force behind the 
markets earlier advances 
the lingering wariness of individual investors since the october 
1987 stock market crash also has hurt the industry 
i wouldnt sit here and wait for his the individual 
investors imminent return in size said james p hanbury a 
securities analyst with wertheim schroeder amp co in new york with 
business slow and expenses high somethings got to give 
total employment by new york stock exchangemember brokerages has 
fallen about 10 percent from a peak of 262173 employees in 
september 1987 to 229455 by mid1989 the firms had added about 
120000 employees from 1980 to the time of the crash 
the decline since then coincides with a steady slowing in the 
growth of revenue jeffrey schaefer director of research for the 
securities industry association an industry trade group said 
overall revenue grew from 50 billion in 1986 to 52 billion last 
year although revenue rose to 60 billion by mid1989 it was 
expected to drop off by the end of the fourth quarter he said 
shearson second only to merrill lynch amp co in terms of the 
number of us retail brokerage offices began laying off some of 
its 38500 employees monday and notified others in a twoparagraph 
newsletter that more acrosstheboard cuts were planned said 
company spokesman steven faigen 
shearson cited among other things the slowdown of market 
activity which includes the buying and selling of stocks and bonds 
that generates commissions and trading profits 
shearson a subsidiary of financial services giant american 
express co earned 106 million or 98 cents a share during the 
first three months of this year that was off 3 percent from 
earnings of 110 million or 105 a share in the same quarter last 
year 
faigen declined to provide details on shearsons layoffs and said 
only that several hundred employees would lose their jobs in the 
next few weeks but a company source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said as many as 800 people or 2 percent of the total work 
force could be cut that would be the largest staff reduction on 
wall street this year 
a year ago shearson laid off about 1200 employees since then 
it has trimmed 300 more jobs 
other wall street firms have retrenched in varying degrees this 
past year 
last week drexel burnham lambert inc laid off more than 100 
employees in its taxable fixedincome sales division the firm 
announced earlier this year it was selling its entire retail 
brokerage division of 2300 workers over the past three years it 
has more than halved its work force from a peak of about 10000 
among the others first boston corp last spring laid off 200 
employees goldman sachs amp co has let go dozens of bond traders 
and smith barney harris upham amp co laid offabout 120 employees 
largely in its municipal bond and stock departments 
long said that in addition to gradual cuts many firms are 
paying close attention to normal attrition and not rehiring

reflecting caution about buying cars and other 
expensive goods american consumers drastically slowed their 
borrowing in september adding only 606 million in credit card and 
other debt 
the federal reserve board reported tuesday that consumer credit 
increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of just 1 percent in 
september down from a revised 46 percent rate of advance in 
august for all of 1988 consumer credit increased 85 percent 
augusts net debt increase totaled 266 billion a sharp 
revision from the 348 billion originally reported last month 
the pace of net borrowing in september was the second slowest of 
the year after an actual decline of 09 percent in july that was 
the first drop since january 1987 when consumer debt fell 34 
percent 
consumer spending is closely monitored as a gauge of the 
economys health because it represents twothird of all economic 
activity the economy particularly housing and manufacturing has 
become sluggish in recent months in response to the feds campaign 
to restrain growth and ease inflationary pressures by keeping 
interest rates relatively high 
auto loans which had dropped sharply in july rebounded a bit in 
august driven by endofmodelyear sales incentives and higher 
prices for 1990 models to come the august sales had the effect of 
stealing from those ordinarily expected in september 
as a result auto loans in september dropped 842 million a 35 
percent annual rate of decline the fed said they were virtually 
unchanged in august after declining 69 percent in july 
sandra shaber an economist with the futures group said the fed 
report may not accurately reflect the amount of consumer debt since 
people have other ways to borrow such as home equity loans that 
are not included in the survey 
but she said consumers are becoming more cautious in their 
spending particularly for autos and other durable goods 
bigticket items expected to last more than three years that often 
are financed by loans 
the category of debt that includes credit cards slowed to a 47 
percent annual rate of growth from a 212 percent advance in august 
total revolving credit increased 756 million compared with a gain 
of 337 billion in august 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by 
785 million a 48 percent annual rate of growth that compared 
with a decline of 29 million or 02 percent in august 
mobile home debts continued to fall down 91 million or a 48 
percent annual rate of decline this category has fallen for eight 
consecutive months including an august drop of 692 million or 351 
percent 
the various changes left total consumer debt in september at a 
seasonally adjusted 7036 billion

a dozen braniff employees gathered 
tuesday afternoon at minskys pizza amp lounge near kansas city 
international airport reflecting on the fate of the carrier on 
which they had spent thousands of hours of their lives 
they had come from all over the country to be part of the 
airlines expansion under which kansas city was a major hub 
but as linda horn watched the television news of braniffs sudden 
cancellation of its flights tears began to well in her eyes for the 
second time in about a month 
were a family said horn a 16year braniff flight 
attendant it just breaks my heart 
horn who recently bought a house said work in the airline 
industry was now over for her 
im fatigued i want to try something else she said 
for many braniff employees the bond among workers was a key 
reason they stayed with the carrier even after their jobs were put 
at risk by braniffs filing for bankruptcy court protection in 
september 
thats why weve gone through what we have said jt 
carroll who has worked as a braniff customer service agent for 17 
years carroll and some others said they remained optimistic that 
braniff would fly again 
once again braniff employees hold their heads high he said 
as he raised a glass 
but for many of braniffs workers the stoppage of flights late 
monday seemed to confirm their previously unspoken fears that little 
hope remained for their carrier or their jobs some spoke harshly of 
braniffs investors who have been accused of reaping riches at the 
expense of the company and its workers 
this may be the final straw for me said mary greene a 
braniff flight attendant who spent tuesday interviewing for other 
work its very stressful to wait around for this sort of 
announcement 
dick goduti a vice chairman of the air line pilots association 
said i think a lot of pilots were waiting for the other shoe to 
fall he added that some pilots were now starting to look for work 
elsewhere 
neither union officials nor braniff workers knew late tuesday 
what would become of their jobs they said they were left in the 
dark just as they were a month ago

embattled braniff inc closed its corporate 
offices and refused further comment after grounding its last 46 
daily flights while it seeks investor cash or an outright buyer 
i dont expect any further announcements airline spokeswoman 
sandy smith at the airlines orlando headquarters said tuesday after 
the abrupt cancellation of braniffs schedule 
chairman william g mcgee and other executives were busy 
arranging details to mothball the carriers fleet and notify most of 
its remaining 1800 employees that they were without jobs 
braniff will determine by friday the exact size of its remaining 
work force said thomas volz senior vice president of marketing 
it could be 150 to 250 or 300 people volz said 
in addition volz said braniff probably will not honor an 
agreement with john hancock mutual life insurance co to extend 
employee health insurance coverage through november if the airline 
fails this week to pay premiums to john hancock or fund the trust 
that pays employees medical claims coverage ends friday 
a severe cash shortage aborted the airlines reorganization plans 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act said mcgee in a 
terse statement at midnight monday braniff which filed for 
protection from its creditors on sept 28 wants to continue its 
charter services while looking for investors or a buyer 
braniffs regular charter customers include the kansas city 
chiefs and the new orleans saints football teams 
there are no plans at this point to gave consideration to 
liquidation said volz he said discussions are under way with 
potential investors whom he declined to identify 
the carrier had been operating from week to week by relying on 
emergency infusions of cash approved by the us bankruptcy court in 
orlando in its bankruptcy filing braniff listed debt of 347 
million and assets of 326 million 
before the filing the carrier operated 256 roundtrip flights a 
day and employed up to 4800 
they pissed away all their cash at the rate of 300000 a day 
when they should have been preserving their cash for a restart of 
the airline said scott hamilton editor of commercial aviation 
report a newsletter based in dallas 
continental and eastern could fly through their bankruptcies 
because they had multimillions of cash on hand hamilton said 
referring to the texas air corp carriers that have undergone 
bankruptcy reorganizations eastern is now flying under chapter 11 
bankruptcy proceedings 
braniff had only 3 million to 10 million in cash on hand 
he said noting that the airline needed 50 million to 100 million 
to survive braniff had as much as 316 million in february but 
was down to only 36 million by july 31 
meanwhile braniff said a meeting of its unsecured creditors 
took place tuesday in orlando but the airline would not comment on 
what was discussed 
however a source close to the case contacted by the kansas city 
times said merrill lynch capital markets which was retained by 
braniff to explore alternatives for the carrier made a presentation 
about the airlines financial condition no potential buyers were 
discussed however 
the abrupt schedule stoppage surprised and angered employees and 
left a few unsuspecting customers frustrated in orlando kansas 
city dallas and other major airports 
ticketholders were advised on a tollfree telephone line to 
check with other airlines who may honor tickets in some cases 
braniff ticket and checkin counters were unstaffed tuesday and 
passengers were getting varying responses from other carriers 
eastern was taking braniff customers on a standby basis united 
was giving braniff ticketholders a 50 percent discount on a 
fullfare coach ticket and continental and southwest also were 
honoring tickets with some restrictions 
there were no long lines at braniff ticket counters like those 
that formed in september when the carrier filed for bankruptcy 
protection but the few customers who did show up tuesday were 
confused and bitter 
we dont know what were going to do said helaine ruglio 
she and her husband richard both 27 were in orlando on a 
sevenday vacation they were scheduled to leave for new jersey on 
tuesday evening but went to the airport nine hours early when they 
heard of braniffs cancellations 
in 1982 a much larger braniff filed for bankruptcy protection 
when it was nearly 1 billion in debt two years later the airline 
started flying again as a lowcost nofrills carrier 
the company was acquired by biacor an investor group formed by 
painewebber inc in june 1988 and shifted most of its flight 
operations from dallas to kansas city

the new york times said it does not expect to lay 
off workers when it closes a new jersey printing plant 
times spokeswoman nancy nielsen said the bulk of the 1200 
workers employed at the plant in carlstadt would be transferred to 
the edison nj plant where new color presses are to begin 
operating next summer 
we do not expect layoffs nielsen said and buyouts are a 
possibility that would be discussed 
the times said in a statement that the decision to close the 
carlstadt plant was influenced by a twoyear decline in advertising 
revenue a trend which is expected to continue in 1990 
george mcdonald president of the allied printing trades council 
said the number of jobs that would be lost was open for 
discussion 
we are both united both the unions and the company united 
for the benefit of getting this up and running without any 
problems mcdonald said after an afternoon meeting where times 
publisher arthur ochs sulzberger and lance r primis president of 
the times addressed leaders of the 10 unions represented by the 
council 
as in the past the times will work with its unions to find 
ways to insure the security of its regular employees sulzberger 
said in a statement 
the unions contracts which do not expire until march 30 1993 
agree to what the times statement called the orderly successful 
and efficient start up and operation of the new plant and the use 
of arbitration to resolve any disputes 
advertising linage declined 55 percent in 1988 compared to 1987 
and declined 79 percent for the first three quarters this year the 
times said 
nielsen said that no figures were available to compare the linage 
decline and the decline in revenue 
but revenues were up for the new york times co she said in the 
first nine months of this year revenues were 129 million versus 
125 million for the same period last year 
the companys newspaper group consisting of the times and 35 
regional newspapers had revenue of 102 billion for the first nine 
months of 1989 versus 101 billion for the same period in 1988 
nielsen said there were no separate figures for the times the bulk 
of the revenue comes from advertising 
the times circulation also climbed according to audit bureau of 
circulations figures quoted by the newspaper circulation reached a 
record for the sixmonth period ended sept 30 of more than 1 
million on weekdays up 28 percent over the same period last year 
sunday circulation was up 17 percent during the same period to 
more than 16 million 
the automated edison presses which will cost more than their 
original estimate in excess of 400 million are situated on 45 
acres of land and will greatly increase production automatic guided 
vehicles or agv robots are part of the production which is

the president of the national futures association 
defended the integrity of the chicago mercantile exchange after a 
former us senator cried foul and quit the exchanges board of 
directors 
former sen thomas f eagleton resigned tuesday saying concern 
for fat cat insiders outweighs the interest of the average 
investor at the worlds secondlargest futures exchange 
eagleton accused the merc of trying to protect its former 
chairman brian monieson who is before a commodity futures trading 
commission hearing board this week on charges of failing to stop two 
employees from defrauding investors 
bob wilmouth president of the national futures association said 
he admires and respects eagleton but disagrees with the criticism 
saying the merc punishes those who break exchange rules 
i think if you go back and take a look merc officials 
have severely punished the violators that they have found 
wilmouth said in a telephone interview from his home 
eagleton said the boards efforts regarding the former chairman 
was the straw that broke the camels back and said he had 
become increasingly disappointed by the boards decisions 
when a serious decision is made by the board i have found that 
consistently its whats best for the insiders that prevails not 
necessarily whats best for the public eagleton said from his law 
firm in st louis 
because of its concern for insiders the merc cannot be trusted 
by the public to police itself eagleton said 
joe sixpack sitting in st louis can have no confidence that 
the order hes entering is going to be treated the same as a fat 
cats order within the mercantile exchange eagleton said he 
just cant have any confidence in that and thats a rotten shame 
the merc issued a threesentence statement saying eagletons 
resignation was accepted 
dave gary a spokesman for the cftc in washington dc said the 
commission had no immediate comment 
as evidence that the exchange protects its own eagleton pointed 
to the willingness of wilmouth and merc executive committee chairman 
leo melamed to act as character witnesses in the cftc action against 
monieson 
but wilmouth said tuesday he has decided not to testify on 
moniesons behalf citing the advice of attorneys who examined the 
mercs code of ethics 
home telephone numbers for monieson and his attorney jerrold

hoylake investments ltd who this year made a 21 
billion hostile bid for bat industries plc intends to pursue a 
takeover of the british tobacco giant a hoylake shareholder said 
wednesday 
anglo group plc which was formed by anglofrench financier sir 
james goldsmith and owns a stake in hoylake included the 
announcement in its sixmonth earnings statement 
goldsmith also heads the investment group that created hoylake to 
launch the 21 billion takeover of the british conglomerate bat last 
july 
hoylakes offer for bat lapsed in september after britains 
takeover panel which monitors mergers and acquisitions said the 
group could relaunch its bid after it clears regulatory hurdles with 
us insurance commissioners 
the bidders are seeking approval from us state insurance 
commissioners to change the ownership of bats farmers insurance 
group inc of los angeles which some say could take months 
anglo said wednesday that hoylake firmly intends to make a new 
offer for bat within 21 days of the clearance date 
hoylake held between 2 percent and 3 percent of bats shares at 
the last announced count 
goldsmith who wants to sell all of bats nontobacco interests 
has said he intends to pursue a takeover of bat 
anglo said the structure of a new bid would depend on the 
progress of bats announced reorganization and upon market 
conditions at the time that such a bid is launched 
bat the worlds biggest tobacco company last month received 
shareholder approval to restructure itself to fend off the bid 
the restructuring involved the sale of bats us retailing 
businesses including saks fifth avenue and marshall fields chains 
and the spinning off of its paper businesses 
bat also intends to buy back 10 percent of its own stock

the first big pile of bills from chinas 
decadelong economic boom are coming due next year and the timing 
couldnt be worse 
foreign exchange earnings are down tourism is a major casualty 
of martial law in beijing and export growth is hobbled by severe 
shortages of energy raw materials and cash 
foreign commercial banks which will be needed to roll over and 
reschedule some of the debt are still warily assessing the 
political and economic fallout from the june power struggle and army 
crackdown on student protesters 
foreign banks have joined recently in arranging three group loans 
for chinese stateowned companies each involving about 50 million 
finlands government decided in october to grant china a 7 million 
interestfree loan to buy a finnish paper mill 
but one western banker said the message from home offices is 
still go slow with longterm commitments for now any new loans 
will cost the chinese at least half a percentage point more in 
interest than before june and bankers want shorter terms and more 
guarantees 
theres a crisis of confidence the banker said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the green light everyone is waiting for is the resumption of new 
world bank loans halted in june because of the confusion in 
beijing the world banks major shareholders including the united 
states have prolonged the freeze as a political sanction 
the asian development bank which also offers lowinterest loans 
must make a decision before the end of its fiscal year in december 
on whether to go ahead with loans to china its president masao 
fujioka said recently that the bank still was preparing loan 
proposals 
chinese officials meanwhile insist their creditworthiness 
remains good 
vice finance minister liu zhongli has repeatedly said china will 
have no difficulty in paying back loans but he acknowledged for the 
first time in october that it would be possible only by taking out 
new loans 
he also said china might set up special debtservice funds to 
make sure money is available for repaying debts 
chinas foreign debt 158 billion in 1985 jumped by about 10 
billion dollars in 1987 and again in 1988 as cities raced to build 
luxury hotels and offices towers and factories imported modern 
assembly lines 
the total is now about 42 billion with about 7 billion in 
principal and interest due in 1990 the first big repayment year 
the government also has a domestic deficit that it is covering by 
cracking down on tax delinquency and issuing new guaranteed value 
public debt notes the notes are sold in units starting at 540 
most work places are requiring employees to buy at least one 
workers already are required to buy treasury bonds amounting to half 
a months salary each year 
the external debt which must be paid in foreign exchange 
presents a greater challenge most of it was contracted for projects 
expected to generate foreign exchange eighty percent of the loans 
went to construction projects including luxury hotels and office 
buildings for foreign businessmen 
but even before junes violent attack on the student 
prodemocracy demonstrators scared away tourists and businessmen 
real estate experts agreed the sector was overbuilt 
since june few hotels have been able to achieve 50 percent 
occupancy rentals of newly opening office towers have slowed and 
foreign bankers say they are quietly rescheduling loans on many 
projects 
other foreign loans went to modernize export industries such as 
textiles but shortages of cotton raw silk and energy have hampered 
growth 
despite the problems foreign bankers say chinas credit rating 
remains good and that it is just a matter of time before outrage 
over junes events fades and their home offices approve a return to 
business as usual 
our experience is quite good they are strict in their 
repayment said the western banker 
assessments are mixed as to whether chinas yearold austerity 
program which has drastically tightened domestic credit and slashed 
new construction has made the investment climate better or worse 
inflation has dropped sharply september prices were up just 13 
percent from the previous september 
but credit has become so short that many companies lack operating 
funds and in some places business has deteriorated to barter 
i wouldnt give a penny to a chinese factory as a borrower 
said another foreign banker but he said major institutions such as 
the bank of china and china international trust and investment corp 
remain good risks

the tiny woman whirls around carpet rolls on a 
motorized cart approaches a customer and asks are you finding 
anything 
nearly 96 rose blumkin is back selling furniture and carpeting 
at a new store she hopes will compete with the first one she founded 
52 years ago and left last may in a power struggle with her two 
grandsons 
customers who remember her from nebraska furniture mart one of 
the nations largest individual furniture stores are finding their 
way across the street to mrs bs warehouse and it hasnt even 
opened officially 
i got the devil in me ill fight as much as i can mrs 
blumkin said recently as she spun around the store helping 
customers and talking about her plans for the future 
my two grandsons say im too old and too cranky they dont

mrs blumkin a 4foot11 russian emigrant who began selling 
furniture in the basement of her husbands secondhand store built 
nebraska furniture mart into a business that had more than 150 
million in sales last year 
the store is known throughout the midwest for its policy to 
sell cheap and always tell the truth and ships furniture to 
customers throughout the united states 
mrs b sold the business for 55 million in 1983 to berkshire 
hathaway inc but remained chairman and ran the carpeting 
department until may 3 of this year when she walked out in a 
dispute with two grandsons 
she said her grandsons ronald and irvin blumkin thought she 
paid too much for carpeting and charged too little 
ronald blumkin the president said he views his grandmothers 
nearby store as competition were not going to treat any 
competitor differently he said 
mrs blumkin has a long way to go to threaten nebraska furniture 
mart but she is trying

carpeting 
ill come to her first mrs lantis said she gives you a 
good deal she doesnt cheat you i love her shes real honest 
she remembers mrs blumkin arguing with her in nebraska furniture 
mart that she didnt need as good a quality of carpeting in her 
bedrooms as in other areas that had higher traffic 
she also remembers mrs blumkin giving her 3yearold daughter a 
ride through nebraska furniture mart on her cart 
mrs blumkin said she cried every day for two months after she 
quit before deciding to take some of her earnings and start over 
again 
her day is long she gets up at 6 am she is at the store by 9 
am and works until 5 pm she then often goes with a driver around 
town checking out parking lots and stores of competitors until as

president bush today signed a bill raising the 
governments borrowing limit to 31 trillion averting a government 
financial crisis and allowing the treasury to replenish its empty 
coffers 
congress had approved the legislation raising the national debt 
ceiling the night before the bill allows the government to avoid a 
default on paying its bills for the first time in history 
the treasury department said that with the higher limit in place 
it would resume borrowing immediately an auction of 16 billion in 
threemonth and sixmonth bills originally scheduled for monday but 
reset for later today will permit the government to redeem the 
138 billion in treasury bills that mature on thursday 
its passage also sets the stge for pressurized confrontations 
between the democraticcontrolled congress and bush on a range of 
issues such as how to stem the tide of red ink that has led to the 
nations huge debt burden 
it provides momentum said house budget committee chairman 
leon panetta dcalif lawmakers will focus on wrapping up some 
longcontentious issues because there really is a chance to 
conclude the congress before thanksgiving he said 
the senate by voice vote and then the house by 26999 sent 
the debt bill to bush tuesday night the measure increases the 
borrowing limit by 300 billion to finance government operations 
well into 1991 
despite such highly touted efforts as the grammrudman law 
government spending continues to outpace revenue recently at a rate 
of 150 billion a year 
as a result the government has been forced to borrow more and 
more money the new statutory debt ceiling an increase from the 
28 trillion already borrowed is more than three times what it was 
at the beginning of the 1980s 
the treasury had said that unless they were allowed to issue new 
debt the government would have been unable to pay its debts on 
thursday it would have been the firstever default by the us 
government a calamity for the world financial markets and americas 
prestige 
the debt bill was passed following days of complex negotiations 
between the two parties on capitol hill and the presidents 
representatives 
as a result of the talks divisive issues such as bushs capital 
gains tax cut and a move to repeal the medicare catastrophic illness 
law were kept off the debt bill rather than risk default 
the debt bill did carry one legislative sweetener repeal of a 
provision in the 1986 income tax law known as section 89 
the provision prohibited employerfinanced health insurance plans 
from discriminating against lowerpaid workers business said it was 
an onerous burden and its repeal was widely supported in both 
parties 
as part of the deal allowing the debt bill to speed through 
tuesday night the house was expected to pass for a second time a 
measure to repeal the catastrophic illness law 
the repeal was attached earlier this year in the house to a 
deficitreduction bill that is still pending the senate countered 
with a plan to scale back but not completely repeal the 
catastrophic law 
the white house and congressional leaders have now agreed to 
consider catastrophic separately from the deficit bill that 
decision was made easier because the repeal would increase the 
deficit at least in the short term 
bush last week agreed to drop his push for a capital gains tax 
cut this year he changed his focus to pressuring congress to pass a 
strong deficitreduction bill 
under the grammrudman law annual government spending in fiscal 
1991 was automatically cut 161 billion dollars beginning oct 1 
if a deficit reduction bill is passed and signed by the president 
those cuts would be at least partially reversed 
the house and senate are currently negotiating apackage of cuts 
in entitlement spending and selected tax increases which would help 
meet the deficitreduction goals

when ira waldbaum decided in 1986 to sell the 
grocery store chain bearing his name he told his sister who told 
her daughter who told her husband who told his stockbroker who 
used the information to buy the companys stock 
broker robert chestman was convicted of charges related to 
insider trading in a case experts say demonstrates the vagueness of 
federal securities laws 
although small by the standards of other ivan boeskyera 
prosecutions the waldbaum case sent a man to prison caused turmoil 
in a wellknown family business and raised issues possibly destined 
for the supreme court 
factually its as straightforward as you could imagine said 
robert l plotz a former assistant us attorney on the case it 
involved one tip in one instance and one set of trades and then a 
pattern of coverup for several months afterward 
prosecutors say the case happened this way 
on the friday before thanksgiving in 1986 waldbaum agreed to 
sell the grocery business founded by his grandfather in 1921 to the 
great atlantic amp pacific tea co better known as aampp for 50 a 
share or 287 million 
the following sunday he told his sister shirley witkin about 
the deal stressing that the information had to remain confidential 
until it was announced publicly 
witkin went to a long island bank with one daughter to remove her 
waldbaum stock certificates and later informed another daughter 
susan loeb who in turn told her husband keith 
keith loeb then told stockbroker chestman who bought 11000 
shares of waldbaum inc for about 25 each making overnight profits 
of 250000 for himself and several clients including loeb 
the securities and exchange commission alerted to the trading by 
routine postmerger stock market surveillance filed civil charges 
loeb cooperated with investigators chestman was charged criminally 
and convicted by a jury last march on 31 counts 
the waldbaum case wasnt a bigmoney swindle keith loeb who 
with his wife legitimately made 16 million on family shares from 
the aampp deal earned 22000 from the illicit trades which occurred 
just 12 days after boesky admitted to the largest insider trading 
ring ever 
the case expanded securities law interpretation to encompass 
disclosure of secrets down a lengthy chain of tipsters no prior 
criminal case had involved confidential information passed among 
several family members 
at issue is whether confidentiality carries down from a corporate 
inner sanctum does a family member who works outside the company 
have any duty to the corporation does that duty transfer to an 
outsider who profits from nonpublic information 
the problem here is information is inherently leaking said 
columbia university law professor john c coffee jr at some point 
it becomes a market rumor this is in that zone where it is a little 
bit more specific than a market rumor 
ira waldbaum took over six brooklyn grocery stores in 1947 after 
his father died expanding waldbaum into a 137supermarket chain in 
new york and new england the family owned more than 60 percent when 
waldbaum was sold to aampp 
testimony at the federal court trial in manhattan last spring 
revealed that waldbaum ran the company tightly but that the family 
wasnt particularly close waldbaum had trouble telling his two 
nieces apart and visited his 90yearold mother just a few times a 
year testimony showed 
the business nonetheless was a family affair so waldbaum got 
word out about the companys sale a legal disclosure under 
securities law all family members were told to keep the information 
secret 
loeb testified he called chestman a senior vice president at 
gruntal amp co and his broker since 1982 on the morning of 
wednesday nov 26 i told him that waldbaums is about to be sold 
and it would be substantially higher than it was currently trading 
at he said 
loeb did not cite his source or say the information was 
confidential 
brokerage records show chestman bought 3000 shares of waldbaum 
stock for himself that day and 8000 for loeb and other clients at 
prices ranging from 2462 to 26 a share 
the sale to aampp was announced after the close of the market by 
the end of the next business day waldbaum stock had surged to 49 a 
share 
chestman denied talking to loeb on wednesday morning the timing 
of chestmans stock purchases lawyers said was a staggering 
coincidence he bought the shares because waldbaum trading volume 
was high and the company was sound 
loeb testified that shortly after the sale he became nervous and 
even asked chestman if he could rescind the trades after learning 
of an sec inquiry loeb admitted to lying to a waldbaum lawyer about 
the trades 
in april the sec showed ira waldbaum a list of buyers of 
waldbaum stock that wednesday including keith loeb and joseph 
sierchio another nephew by marriage i would say i was rather 
surprised waldbaum testified 
loeb paid the sec more than 45000 in alleged illegal profits 
and penalties sierchio a new york securities lawyer paid a total 
of 123000 and was not prosecuted 
chestmans conviction hinged on whether loeb had a duty to the 
waldbaum company via the family and whether chestman knew he was 
breaching it 
the government argued that loeb had a duty to his wife who had a 
duty to her mother who had a duty to ira waldbaum who had a duty 
to the company but chestman attorney elkan abramowitz said 
thats too flimsy to be the basis for criminal action 
there was no preexisting relationship of trust and confidence 
established beyond the fact that these people were related 
abramowitz argued before the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
earlier this month 
but assistant us attorney e scott gilbert told the threejudge 
panel that all family members were intertwined in a legal bond and 
chestman knew it 
hes taking the rap for the breach of a family relationship 
judge roger miner said in questioning gilbert 
no hes taking the rap your honor for taking stolen 
information and trading on it gilbert replied 
chestman 42 began serving a twoyear sentence shortly after 
conviction rather than wait for the appeal to finish he is 
eligible for parole from a minimumsecurity prison in allenwood 
pa in february civil charges are pending 
abramowitz said his client whose wife and three children live on 
long island felt he couldnt get a job until the case was behind 
him so he decided to serve time as soon as possible he said the 
chestmans were devastated by the case 
ive never had anybody as affected by the criminal process as 
this particular family was abramowitz said dreadful

mesa airlines inc and air midwest inc 
wednesday announced they have called off negotiations on mesas 
possible takeover of air midwest a carrier that has lost business 
due to the problems at braniff inc gary risley mesas vice 
president for corporate affairs said the companies mutually decided 
to end negotiations tuesday and that mesa has withdrawn its cash 
plus stock offer for air midwests outstanding shares 
basically both parties negotiated in good faith for a good deal 
of time and there were just a couple of issues that could not be 
agreed upon he said 
risley declined to discuss specifically why the airlines 
terminated the negotiations 
robert priddy air midwests president and chief executive 
officer also declined to discuss why the negotiations broke down 
both parties negotiated in good faith when youre working on a 
definitive merger agreement there are a lot of points we just 
couldnt agree on some of them he said 
priddy said he did not know whether other companies were waiting 
to approach air midwest with takeover proposals 
air midwests board in june rejected resort airs 31 million 
buyout offer 
mesa on oct 12 sent a letter to priddy asking to enter into an 
exclusive agreement that would lead to an acquisition of air midest 
based in wichita kan 
mesas negotiating suggestion of 634 per share of air midwest 
stock based on the market price at the time the letter was sent 
calculated to more than 24 million 
risley said acquiring air midwest would have given mesa flights 
that travel from the southwest to the midwest 
air midwest has 42 airplanes and serves 39 cities in kansas 
missouri colorado nebraska iowa indiana arkansas alabama 
kentucky illinois and tennessee 
the airline was hit hard by the recent bankruptcy reorganization 
attempt by braniff airlines which on tuesday announced it was 
grounding its last 46 daily flights and laying off its remaining 
1800 employees 
air midwest provided connector flights to braniffs hub in kansas 
city and about half of its revenue was from ties with braniff 
priddy said air midwest is trying to sell seven saab 340 aircraft 
that became surplus planes when the braniff feeder flights ended 
air midwest laid off 165 workers on oct 5 on the heels of a 
30worker layoff earlier that week the cuts were intended to save 
about 200000 a month the airline has not laid off any more 
employees since then 
during the second quarter of this year the latest period for 
which figures were available air midwest earned 16 million 
nearly four times the earnings for the same quarter in 1988 
mesa has 16 airplanes serving 25 cities in new mexico colorado 
wyoming arizona and texas 
mesas subsidiary skyway airlines of milwaukee has six 
airplanes serving 15 cities in iowa indiana illinois michigan and 
wisconsin mesa acquired skyway in april 
risley said mesa does not own any air midwest stock priddy owns 
more than 13 percent of the airlines stock or about 509000 shares 
mesa on aug 4 reported net income of 101546 or 6 cents a 
share on revenue of more than 58 million for its third fiscal 
quarter that ended june 30 
the company reported net income of 3492 on revenue of more than 
4 million for the same period that ended june 30 1988 
mesa last month rejected a merger proposed by a smaller carrier 
stateswest airlines in phoenix which serves communities in arizona 
southern california and nevada 
risley said he could not comment on whether mesa was looking to 
acquire other specific airlines but said the company is always 
looking for good investment opportunities that would allow us to 
expand beyond what we have now

the senate headed today toward a final vote on 
a compromise plan to raise the minimum wage to 425 an hour which 
some republicans claimed would hurt the economy and cost young 
workers their jobs 
there is unanimous agreement except among politicians that 
this is not the thing to do said sen jesse helms rnc citing 
studies that a higher minimum wage likely would fuel inflation and 
make marginal businesses less likely to hire new workers so what 
do politicians do they go ahead and do it 
the opposition of helms and other republicans notwithstanding 
the compromise plan agreed to by president bush and congressional 
democrats was expcted to win final passage by days end 
the vote originally was planned for tuesday but negotiations on a 
plan to raise the federal debt limit stalled the minimumwage 
debate that logjam was broken late tuesday and the minimumwage 
bill was the first order of senate business today 
several gop senators were mulling amendments despite an attempt 
by the bush administration to persuade them not to offer any if 
offered none was expected to pass but debate on them would delay a 
final vote still expected later today 
the compromise passed by the house last week would raise the 
wage floor for the first time since it reached 335 an hour in 1981 
labor secretary elizabeth dole in a letter tuesday reminded 
senators the administration supported the compromise approved by the 
house and accordingly i ask for your support of this same bill now 
before the senate with no amendments attached 
aides to sen orrin hatch rutah said he planned to offer an 
amendment to exempt small businesses from the increase in the 
minimum wage sen gordon humphrey rnh said today he also might 
offer an amendment but did not offer details 
the minimum wage paid to an estimated 4 million americans would 
rise to 380 next april 1 and to 425 a year later under the 
legislation 
it also would create a subminimum for workers 16 to 19 years old 
new to the job market all workers in that age group could be paid 
the subminimum for their first three months of work experience and 
up to six months provided they were in certified training programs 
for the final three months 
the subminimum would be 335 when the minimum wage rose to 
380 it would rise to 361 when the minimum wage rose to 425 
the provision allowing the subminimum expires in 1993

us net farm income will decline steadily 
through 1996 from its current record heights researchers said 
wednesday 
the projections include forecasts of falling government 
subsidies declining soybean prices and generally stable prices for 
cattle hogs and corn 
the food and agricultural policy research institute predicted a 
27 percent drop in net farm income by 1996 but said that still 
would leave the income figure higher than in any year before 1986 
when adjusted for inflation however the drop is steeper 
net farm income represents agricultures contribution to the 
gross national product it measures the return to farmers for their 
labor and management of farms and households 
the projections were released at the institutes fall 
agribusiness outlook and policy conference in this westcentral iowa 
farm community the institute is a joint program of the center for 
agricultural and rural development at iowa state university and the 
center for national food and agricultural policy at the university 
of missouri 
patrick westhoff a research associate at iowa state center said 
the forecast is designed as a reference point for policy makers as 
they prepare a new federal farm program for 1990 when the 1985 law 
expires 
one basic assumption is that current domestic and foreign 
agricultural policies are continued the impact of any policy 
changes then could be measured against the projections westhoff 
told the conference 
the institute predicts 
net farm income will rise to approximately 492 billion this 
year from 457 billion last year then fall to about 36 billion by 
1996 after adjusting for inflation by measuring net farm income in 
terms of the buying power of the dollar in 1967 the forecast 
projects a 43 percent slide from 146 billion in 1989 to 84 
billion in 1996 
government payments to farmers will fall from an estimated 105 
billion in 1989 to almost 58 billion in 1996 
cash receipts from sales of crops and livestock will rise 16 
percent to 1804 billion from 1556 billion production expenses 
will rise 24 percent to 1704 billion from 1374 billion 
corn prices will average 218 per bushel in the marketing year 
that ends next august and 219 per bushel in the year that ends in 
august 1996 in the meantime prices range from 199 per bushel in 
the 199192 marketing year to 220 in 199394 
soybean prices should average 578 per bushel in the current 
marketing year and 634 in 199596 dropping as low as 526 in 
199091 
prices of slaughter steers at omaha should average 7233 per 
100 pounds this year rising to 7932 in 1996 with a low of 6948 
in 1995 
prices of butcher hogs should average 4230 per 100 pounds this 
year and rise to 4540 in 1996 with a low of 4074 in 1992 and a 
high of 4595 in 1994

was taking steps in the money markets to encourage interest rates to 
decline news accounts this morning quoted unnamed government 
officials as saying that inference was correct 
analysts said the news heartened stock traders who had been 
growing increasingly apprehensive about the possibility of a 
recession 
wall streeters still expect corporate profits which came in 
below expectations for the third quarter to be disappointing for 
the next few months 
but the fed could presumably cushion the impact of an economic 
slowdown in the future by relaxing its credit policy now

drought dropping production and changes in 
consumer tastes are forcing americans to pay more for milk at the 
supermarket and creating shortages for some dairy processors 
the us bureau of labor statistics reported that retail milk 
prices in the united states averaged 127 per half gallon in 
october the highest level this decade 
prices for milk cheese and other dairy products have been 
increasing this fall at a pace 50 percent faster than the overall 
consumer price index during that time the bureau said 
jim miller an agricultural economist with the us department of 
agriculture in washington said retail milk prices probably would 
continue to increase through the end of this year although 
consumers may see lower prices in the spring 
in parts of new york city the new york state department of 
agricultural and markets reported that milk now costs as much as 
255 a gallon richard kessel executive director of the states 
consumer protection board has warned that the increases might make 
milk too expensive for lowerincome families 
its becoming a very expensive commodity said kessel i 
think that when you recognize the fact that milk is probably the 
most important staple for any american family you see the rising 
prices of milk at the retail level is very disturbing 
dairy industry experts say american consumers still are paying 
for the drought of 1988 which scorched farmland in parts of the 
midwest south and the northeast the quality of feed grown during 
that summer was inferior to previous crops and the milk production 
of cows feeding on those grains has been below average 
according to the usda american farmers produced 1 percent less 
milk in august than they did in august 1988 in september milk 
production was off 2 percent from the same month last year 
fewer dairy cows are producing milk in the united states now than 
in the mid 1980s some 16 million head of dairy cattle were taken 
out of milk production under the federal buyout program designed to 
trim us milk surpluses 
the production decline has been accentuated by an increase in the 
amount of milk being used for making cheese which reflects 
increased consumer demand for that product according to earl 
fuller an agricultural economist at the university of minnesota 
ed coughlin director of regulatory affairs for the national milk 
producers federation in arlington va said tight milk supplies 
also stemmed partly from commitments by us processors to supply 
nonfat dry milk to mexico and other foreign countries 
when american milk production unexpectedly began to tail off 
midway through this year some processors had to scramble to get 
enough milk to produce as much cheese nonfat dry milk butter ice 
cream and other domestic dairy products coughlin said 
plants that might be operating normally at 90 percent to 95 
percent of capacity might have to operate at 75 percent if they were 
unable to buy as much milk as they wanted he said 
is that a shortage i dont really see that as a shortage of 
milk he said 
coughlin said about half the milk produced in the united states 
is sold fresh in stores there will be enough milk meet that demand 
for the next several months he said until the traditional spring 
production surplus wipes out any short supplies 
the usda predicts prices will plunge dramatically by spring when 
milk prices traditionally reach their lows of the year due to peak 
supply and slack demand 
robert cropp a farm economist at the university of 
wisconsinplatteville projects that the upward price trend will 
last until about midfebruary when a decline will start as the 
traditional spring milk flush approaches 
the beneficiaries of the recent price increases are the american 
dairy farmers whove struggled to make money for most of this decade 
while milk prices have been stable or even dropped and 
production costs have increased 
the base price for milk produced in the united states determined 
by processors in the leading milkproducing states of minnesota and 
wisconsin has increased from 1098 per hundred pounds in march to 
1387 per hundred pounds in october that price is boosted further 
by regional premiums added by federal milkprice regulating boards 
around the country 
the minnesotawisconsin price in october was 199 per hundred 
pounds higher than the base milk price in october 1988

the parent company of walter industries inc 
wants to refinance 6243 million in debt before jan 1 when 
interest rates on the junk bonds are scheduled to be reset 
the move announced tuesday by hillsborough holding corp is 
designed to buy time for the construction and buildingsupplies 
company 
if the holding company fails to restructure the debt before jan 
1 when the interest rates are reset some bondholders are likely to 
demand high yields that could saddle walter industries with 
interest costs it cant afford 
hillsborough announced a plan to ask its junk bondholders to 
swap existing bonds for a package of new bonds and varying amounts 
of cash the new bonds would carry a slightly higher interest rate 
of around 18 percent and be accompanied by cash payments of 3 or 
5 
interest rates on those bonds also would be subject to future 
adjustment but not until nov 1 1990 giving the company 10 more 
months of breathing room 
bondholders have until dec 5 to exchange their holdings the 
plan is contingent on the willingness of 80 percent of junk 
bondholders to swap 
what it comes down to is were faced with interest rates we 
dont think the bonds deserve said david l townsend spokesman 
for tampabased walter industries inc this is compounded by the 
fact that the market is volatile 
hillsborough said its refinancing package would better 
insulate the company from possible distortions in its capital 
structure that could be caused by current market conditions the 
company added that its operations are presently strong and 
performing according to plan 
the bonds are part of a 11 billion junkbond financing package 
used last year to take walter industries formerly jim walter 
corp private in a leveraged buyout 
the acquisition of the publicly held company was orchestrated by 
the new york investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co and the 
bond financing was managed by the investment firm drexel burnham 
lambert inc 
the prices of junk bonds are depressed a result of turmoil 
caused by defaults and neardefaults by some companies that issued 
junk bonds 
hillsboroughs bond prices also are low because of renewed 
concern about its asbestos liability stemming from a lawsuit filed 
earlier this year 
a hillsborough junk bond that was sold last year with a face 
value of 100 was priced at the end of last month about 55 
meeting the jan 1 bond value would force the company to pay an 
interest rate of more than 40 percent said king penniman managing 
director of mccarthy crisanti amp maffei inc a new york junk bond 
investment adviser theres no way they can reset these

representatives of the machinists union and condor 
partners met wednesday amid reports the ual corp board of directors 
has given its chairman permission to explore the possibility of a 
buyout or recapitalization of united airlines parent 
the meeting in washington dc was held only to hear what 
condor is planning for ual said spokesman jim conley of the 
machinists uniteds largest union representing 25000 of its 70000 
workers 
he said the union was not seeking to reach any immediate 
agreements with condor which was formed by coniston partners a new 
york investment group that announced last week it had accumulated a 
97 percent stake in chicagobased ual 
coniston principal augustus oliver refused to elaborate on the 
substance of wednesdays meeting with the machinists whose 
opposition contributed to the october collapse of a pilotmanagement 
buyout proposal 
condor was established to solicit majority support from ual 
shareholders for conistons effort to reduce uals board from 16 
members to five three of whom would be coniston principals 
with control of the board coniston could direct ual toward a 
sale restructuring or recapitalization in 1987 coniston then 
the majority shareholder helped force a restructuring of uniteds 
parent then called allegis corp 
meanwhile wednesday published reports indicated that the ual 
board had cleared chairman stephen wolf to explore new means of 
mounting a buyout or recapitalization of the company 
ual spokeswoman sara dornacker declined to comment 
oliver said he was familiar with the reports but had no comment 
in any event there has been no change in our plans to gain 
control of ual he said from new york weve been talking to all 
interested parties and will continue to do so 
the reports concerning wolf were confirmed by hank krakowski of 
the air line pilots association which spearheaded the failed 
pilotmanagement bid for ual he declined to elaborate 
but krakowski said uniteds pilots are continuing to explore 
any and all options in its effort to gain employee control of the 
airline 
the pilots union has held talks with management he said 
all i can say is the pilots are seeking employee ownership with 
the current management team but would not exclude an effort with 
other parties krakowski said 
robert j joedicke an airline analyst with shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york said the ual boards action regarding wolf 
was not surprising or new 
he noted the board had issued a vague statement last month 
suggesting wolf get on with managing the company and indicating it 
would not consider any offer under 300 a share the pershare 
price of the failed 675 billion bid 
joedicke said he believes ual management has been pursuing 
another buyout offer or recapitalization since the announcement last 
month that the pilotmanagement group was unable to secure financing 
i suspect that it another buyout bid has been progressing all 
along and has moved from act one to act two he said 
the announcement of the collapse of the pilotmanagement deal on 
oct 13 helped trigger a 190point drop in the dow jones average of 
30 industrials 
conley said the machinists meeting with condor principals was 
part of a union effort to discover some way to put united back on 
stable ground and end the bidding war which the union contends 
would lead to overwhelming debt for the nations secondlargest 
carrier 
he said the machinists would not participate in any deal that 
would give the pilots control of the airline but had not ruled out 
a compromise on the magnitude of employee ownership

city officials said wednesday that if 
braniff inc doesnt pay 18 million in overdue airport rental and 
gate fees by nov 28 it risks losing its gates at kansas city 
international airport 
kansas city will file a motion in federal bankruptcy court next 
week demanding the payment and will resist any effort by braniff to 
extend the deadline said assistant city attorney nordahl holte 
the city councils aviation committee expressed concern that the 
airport gates would be unused for a long time as braniff moves 
through bankruptcy court 
airline officials were unavailable for comment 
braniff filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from 
creditors on sept 28 the orlando flabased airline canceled its 
remaining flights at midnight monday due to a severe cash shortage 
and said it would dismiss most of its remaining 1800 employees 
under federal bankruptcy law braniff has 60 days from its sept 
28 filing to decide whether to pay the airport fees give up the 
gates or seek an extension 
if braniff does not pay a lender that loaned braniff money 
before bankruptcy would have the option of taking over the leases 
if the lender declines to pay the bills by dec 28 the city would 
be free to offer the gate space to other airlines 
seprately the head of a concern that planned to acquire the 
airline said those plans had changed since braniffs virtual 
shutdown 
farhad azima head of kansas citybased aviatin leasing group 
said he still would consider using some of braniffs assets to 
operate a passenger airline service focused principally on kansas 
city but hopes of renewing service through braniff have ended he 
said 
based on the present situation we have to look at it in a 
different view than as a going concern he said our plan to 
revive braniff is no longer applicable we will look at its assets 
but no longer look at it as a going concern 
the airlines decision to stop air service makes restarting it 
too difficult he said 
azima plans to meet with his investment bankers in new york next 
week to decide whether to become involved in braniffs bankruptcy 
reorganization

the senate gave final passage wednesday to 
legislation to raise the hourly minimum wage to 425 by april 1991 
the first increase in the floor wage since 1981 president bush is 
expected to sign the bill next week 
the 898 senate vote came eight days after bush and congressional 
democrats agreed on the plan to boost the minimum wage by 45 cents 
next april 1 and another 45 cents a year later 
the measure passed overwhelmingly by the house last week also 
creates a new subminimum wage that could be paid to teenagers for 
their first three months in the work force and up to three months 
more for those in certified training or education programs 
bushs signature will not only trigger the first increase in the 
minimum wage in nearly a decade but also will end a bitter stalemate 
between congressional democrats and successive republican 
administrations over the politically charged issue 
the nineyear logjam on the minimum wage is finally broken 
said sen edward m kennedy dmass a key architect of the 
compromise the working poor are about to receive an increase 
although it is not as much as they deserve 
kennedy promised to return to the issue and seek another increase 
as the 1992 presidential election nears democrats may try to use 
the issue against bush then but on wednesday they had praise for 
the president 
we all owe a debt of gratitude to the president of the united 
states who was willing to stand up and support a minimum wage 
increase thereby reversing the policy of the prior administration 
which had consistently opposed any increase said majority leader 
george mitchell of maine 
sen orrin hatch of utah one of two republicans who 
unsuccessfully sought to amend the measure credited democrats and 
kennedy with a victory over the white house in the compromise talks 
hes won with the president hatch said of kennedy he got 
the president to come his way 
aflcio president lane kirkland said the labor federation was 
delighted that the compromise bill to raise the minimum wage has 
cleared the senate and is on its way to the presidents desk 
americas poorest workers have gone nearly a decade without a raise 
and this long overdue step will give them a chance to lift 
themselves and their families out of poverty 
the final vote came afer hatch and a handful of other 
conservative republicans long opposed to any increase made a 
spirited rhetorical effort to derail the compromise by defeating or 
amending it 
the fact is that this legislation will not help the people it 
says it is supposed to help those people at the bottom of the 
economic ladder said sen steve symms ridaho 
but even the senates gop leaders citing bushs deal with the 
democrats frowned on the amendment efforts 
the president made an agreement republican leader bob dole 
of kansas said in urging his colleagues not to support amendments 
the minimum wage frozen at 335 an hour since january 1981 is 
paid to about 4 million american workers but the legislation likely 
will have a broader impact by driving up the wages of workers who 
now make slightly more than the minimum wage particularly those 
covered by collective bargaining agreements 
such wage inflation was a major concern of republicans and 
business interests who opposed any increase in the minimum wage but 
bushs campaign promise to support one left them hobbled in their 
efforts to block a boost one of organized labors top priorities 
throughout the 1980s 
labor on the other hand which failed to win an increase during 
the eightyear reagan administration and lost in its first fight 
with bush on the issue was forced to drop its longstanding 
opposition to any subminimum wage 
bush in june vetoed a democraticbacked bill calling for an 
increase to 455 and as his veto was sustained said he would not 
budge from his offer of an increase to 425 an hour by january 1992 
provided employers could pay all newly hired workers a subminimum 
for up to six months 
the white house under increasing pressure from gop lawmakers 
seeking to avoid another veto battle heading into an election year 
two weeks ago signaled a willingness to strike a deal and both 
sides made concessions leading to the compromise 
bush agreed to a timetable reaching the 425 level nine months 
before he had proposed and also accepted a far more restrictive 
training wage than he had demanded the compromise limits 
application of the subminimum to workers 1619 years old requires 
actual skills training for it to be paid to those with more than 
three months work experience and prevents it being paid to any 
worker with six months total experience the provision allowing the 
subminimum expires in april 1993 
bush wanted a provision allowing the lower wage to be paid to all 
workers regardless of age for their first six months on any new 
job regardless of past work experience 
labor and the democratic sponsors of the increase in addition to 
accepting the new subminimum lowered their final target for the 
increase at one time more than 5 to 425 an hour they also 
gave up demands for a commission to report annually on whether 
additional boosts were needed opponents of any increase feared such 
a panel would become a lobbying arm for annual confrontations on the 
issue 
all eight senators voting againt the measure were republicans 
they were sens william armstrong of colorado hatch and jake garn 
of utah jesse helms of north carolina gordon humphrey of new 
hampshire connie mack of florida don nickles of oklahoma and 
symms of idaho

according to another court filing boeing is an unindicted 
coconspirator of richard lee fowler a former company marketing 
analyst awaiting trial on charges of obtaining more than 100 
pentagon documents between 1979 and 1985 
many of the documents fowler obtained were classified according 
to the indictment 
robert s bennett boeings washington attorney declined to 
comment on the case 
the documents fowler who worked as a civilian air force employee 
before joining boeing is accused of giving boeing include material 
on former president reagans strategic defense initiative 
under the terms of the guilty plea being negotiated with boeing 
the pentagon could still take steps to bar the company from future 
defense contracts according to the sources 
the company has agreed to reimburse the government for the cost 
of the investigation 
defense department spokesman glenn flood said a decision on 
whether to bar boeing from bidding on future contracts would be made 
as part of an administrative proceeding conducted by the air force 
its not an automatic thing he said but a decision to debar 
boeing would apply to all pentagon procurement not just air force 
contracts he said 
howard w cox deputy assistant inspector general for the defense 
department said that if a contractor agrees to take adequate 
corrective measures theres a good chance the air force will not 
take any action 
fowler 64 of springfield va is to go on trial dec 4 on 
charges of conspiracy conveyance without authority mail fraud and 
conversion of government property he has declined to comment about 
the case 
he is accused of obtaining detailed budget documents for various 
defense department programs including a fiveyear plan for the 
pentagon such material would help a defense company submit bids for 
government contracts 
prosecutors allege that while the indictment charges folwer with 
obtaining 110 documents for boeing he procured more than 600 
classified documents for the defense contractor over the sixyear 
period 
in doing so he was able to give boeing a comprehensive picture 
of the internal dynamics of the defense departments planning and 
budgeting system prosecutors say in court documents obtained by the 
morning news tribune of tacoma wash 
court files contain a 1986 interview with fowler by boeing 
officials as part of an internal inquiry conducted at the direction 
of the defense department 
fowler said in the interview that he received calls from managers 
in various boeing divisions asking him to get the pentagon planning 
and budget documents 
asked if he was pressured into obtaining them fowler replied 
no thats what i was hired to do 
in another statement fowler said he considered it an accepted 
practice throughout the defense industry to acquire such information 
fowler was critical of the pentagons classification practices 
saying that some papers were overclassified and others were 
classified for political rather than security reasons sometimes 
information would be classified in one document and unclassified in 
another he said 
i never consciously believed that the data extracted from dod 
documents in spite of the classification was in fact classified 
nor would the data in any way compromise the security of the 
nation he wrote

a japanese electronics industry group has offered to 
share information about advanced highdefinition television with 
us semiconductor makers to allow them to produce components for 
japanesedeveloped hdtv systems us industry officials said 
wednesday 
the electronic industry association of japan said it would 
welcome the active participation of foreignbased semiconductor 
manufacturers in hdtv the us semiconductor industry association 
said in a statement 
hdtv which uses large numbers of semiconductor chips to produce 
images as clear as in movie theaters is seen by some analysts as a 
key element of the consumer electronics industrys future 
e david metz executive director of the semiconductor industry 
associations japan office said the two industry groups agreed in 
talks tuesday night to establish committees on hdtv cooperation and 
technical exchange 
he said the committees would provide us semiconductor makers 
with an opportunity to supply chips for japanese hdtv 
manufacturers 
we dont see that there are formal barriers to participation 
metz said wednesday we sense a cooperative attitude 
he said the talks were not likely to have an immediate effect on 
sales of usmade semiconductors in japan because hdtv equipment is 
still at the prototype stage 
but we hope it will encourage more design activity in japan 
by us semiconductor makers he said more us designs of hdtv 
chips for japanese manufacturers should show up in volume business 
later he said 
wilfred corrigan chairman of the semiconductor group said 
tuesday that japanese companies and government agencies have stepped 
up their efforts in recent months to increase purchases of foreign 
semiconductors but that foreign chips still have only a 112 
percent share of the japanese market 
im optimistic these new efforts and this new openness is going 
to result in a very real increase in market share for american 
companies he said 
the semiconductor industry association says japan pledged in 
semiconductor negotiations in 1986 to boost the share of foreign 
chips in the japanese market to more than 20 percent within five 
years but japanese officials say the figure was a goal not a 
commitment

the debate over whether computerized program 
trading is good or bad for the stock market moves to washington 
thursday with former treasury secretary donald regan and other wall 
street heavy hitters testifying before a house panel 
the chairman of the house subcommittee that will hear regan plans 
to introduce legislation to restrict program trading during market 
drops 
but a senate leader said wednesday that there wont be enough 
time to shoehorn a program trading ban into pending legislation 
before congress adjourns for the holidays 
program trading rapidfire transactions through computerized 
buy and sell programs has been a topic of dispute for years but 
the debate heated up again after the oct 13 stock market slide 
when the dow jones 30stock industrial average dropped more than 
190 points on that friday the 13th many critics said the situation 
was worsened by program trading especially one form index 
arbitrage in which speculators try to take advantage of 
inconsistencies between the stock and futures markets by 
simultaneously buying in one while selling in the other 
critics believe the computerized trading strategy also creates 
wild price swings and that in turn has driven small investors out 
of the market 
the new york stock exchange has called on large institutional 
investors to curb program trading while it considers ways to handle 
the bursts of stock orders it generates 
regan a former head of merrill lynch amp co has likened program 
trading to casino gambling and told a senate committee last year 
that index arbitrage was to blame for the 1987 stock market crash 
he is expected to express a similar view thursday to a 
subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee 
rep edward j markey dmass the subcommittee chairman said 
he called the session to hear from those who have firsthand 
experience with the destructive impacts of such program trading 
strategies 
in addition to regan other witnesses scheduled to appear before 
the subcommittee on telecommunications and finance include william 
j oneil chairman of the financial newspaper investors daily w 
james tozer president of prudentialbache securities inc philip 
j purcell chairman of dean witter financial services inc and 
stephen b timbers chief investment officer of kemper financial 
services inc 
markey is introducing an amendment to pending market reform 
legislation that would halt program trading in times of extreme 
market turbulence 
there has been an unprecedented outcry over program trading by 
the nations investment community in the days since the oct 13 
market collapse said markey chairman of the telecommunications 
and finance subcommittee 
but at the senate banking committee sen christopher j dodd 
dconn chairman of the securities subcommittee said he didnt 
think there was enough time to add a program trading ban and still 
get the legislation passed before congress adjourns 
i could not get the bill out with program trading dodd told 
a press briefing wednesday there are just too many members of the 
committee who have strong reservations about the program trading 
piece 
dodd added its important that this congress not let time go 
by without expressing its view on market reforms 
markeys amendment would grant emergency powers to the securities 
and exchange commission to temporarilly halt program trading during 
wide market price swings 
the amendment would be added to the stock market reform act of 
1989 which is pending before the subcommittee that bill calls for 
four major reforms giving the sec authority to halt trading in 
market emergencies requiring reports of large securities and 
options trades and rules for assessing the financial stability of 
the parent companies of brokerdealers 
a similar bill is pending in the senate

exchange as uncertainty continues around labor activity at chiles

floridas top banking regulator tried 
again wednesday to push a miami savings and loan into selling its 
28 million art collection which includes a 132 million rubens 
portrait 
state comptroller gerald lewis filed a 14page administrative 
complaint against centrust savings bank and its chairman david l 
paul to turn over the collection to a qualified art expert 
approved by lewis office 
lewis contends the art purchases were an unauthorized investment 
for a savings and loan and in particular one that has lost 
millions of dollars in recent months 
were taking this action to expedite the sale of the 
collection lewis said in a statement from his office by 
seeking an art expert it is our intention to see that the 
institution gets the best possible price for these works 
the collection which consists of at least 25 pieces includes 
portrait of a man in armor as mars a work by 17th century 
dutch painter rubens which was bought by centrust for 132 
million according to the complaint 
telephone calls to centrust late wednesday were unanswered 
the comptrollers action comes seven months after he ordered 
centrust to sell the art in an april 7 letter lewis gave the 
thrift six months to sell the artworks but lewis office says only 
three pieces have been sold 
in the new complaint lewis claimed centrusts purchase was an 
unsafe or unsound business practice because of the speculative 
nature of art 
respondents purchase of the art collection constitutes 
practices and conduct contrary to generally accepted standards 
applicable to a savings association especially for an insured 
financial institution that lost more than 29 million during the 
last 15 months the complaint said 
the thrift was given 21 days to challenge lewis proposed order 
if challenged the matter would be heard by an administrative law 
judge said lewis spokesman terence mcelroy 
if centrust does not contest the complaint a final order would 
be issued by lewis office giving the thrift 10 days to turn over 
the art he said

texas air corp the nations largest airline company reported 
wednesday a net loss of 158 million in the third quarter as its 
eastern airlines subsidiary continued to lose money pan am corp 
said its net income dropped to 458000 from 674 million a year 
earlier as passenger traffic continued to decline on its north 
atlantic routes 
houstonbased texas air parent of both eastern and continental 
airlines again saw profits at continental offset by losses at 
eastern which has been in bankruptcy reorganization since it was 
struck by its three unions on march 4 
texas air said it lost 158 million or 409 a share in the 
three months ended sept 30 widened from a net loss of 1141 
million or 305 a share a year earlier 
thirdquarter revenue fell to 167 billion from 219 billion 
for the first nine months of the year texas air had a net loss 
of 5228 million or 1351 a share widened from a loss of 4943 
million or 1306 a share in the same period of 1988 
ninemonth revenue tumbled to 496 billion from 655 billion 
miamibased eastern recorded a thirdquarter net loss of 1852 
million widened from a loss of 1129 million in the same quarter 
of 1988 
easterns revenue for the latest quarter dropped to 3057 
million from 9127 million 
eastern continued to successfully rebuild its operations 
during the third quarter at a rate well beyond expectations 
eastern president phil bakes said in a statement while losses 
were substantial they were well within projections and reflect 
the costs of building back our operations 
houstonbased continental which reported its thirdquarter 
results on monday more than doubled its earnings partly because 
of the sale of some assets 
in the quarter continental had net income of 435 million on 
revenue of 134 billion up from net income of 152 million on 
revenue of 126 billion in the same period in 1988 
in late august texas air chairman frank lorenzo said he was 
considering a sale of all or part of continental because its 
business was being hurt by the longrunning strike against eastern 
mickey foret was named president of continental last week 
replacing joseph corr who resigned after less than 10 months on the 
job while remaining as texas air chairman lorenzo was named 
continentals chairman and chief executive officer positions which 
corr also held 
pan am the nations eighthlargest airline said its pershare 
earnings for the three months ended sept 30 fell to less than 1 
cent from 47 cents in the third quarter of 1988 
the latest results include a gain of 184 million from 
completion of the sale of a division of pan am world services 
which sells security maintenance and other services to airlines 
government agencies and the military the subsidiary was purchased 
by johnson controls inc of milwaukee wis 
pan ams thirdquarter revenue slipped 19 percent to 102 
billion from 104 billion a year earlier 
the company blamed the decline on continued falling passenger 
traffic between the united states and europe stemming from the 
december 1988 crash in lockerbie scotland and on increased 
competition on flights within west germany euroberlin a joint 
venture of lufthansa german airlines and air france started 
operating in the country about a year ago 
the dollars strength against european currencies during the 
period also depressed revenue somewhat pan am said 
pan american world airways its largest subsidiary reported a 
net loss of 219 million in the third quarter compared with a net 
profit of 523 million a year earlier 
results for the third quarter our peak season were clearly 
disappointing said pan am chairman thomas g plaskett 
however we are encouraged by the declining rate of revenue 
shortfall and the improving trend of future bookings 
for the first nine months of the year the parent company posted 
a net loss of 1583 million or 109 a share widened from a net 
loss of 21 million or 15 cents a share in the same period in 
1988 
ninemonth revenue declined 24 percent to 266 billion from

only tokyo among the major financial centers has higher office 
costs than london the central bank said

living expenses in london the bank said are not far out of 
line with its main european counterparts or new york and 
considerably cheaper than japan

have shown that london overall is a cheaper business location than 
brussels frankfurt or paris the bank said

london less appealing as an international financial center 
this congestion is likely to become a serious concern unless 
major improvements currently under examination can be made in the

a judge on wednesday approved the sale of the 
chicagotost louis line of chicago missouri and western railway 
co ending fears of a shutdown during the companys bankruptcy 
reorganization its trustee said 
us bankruptcy judge john schwartz made final a tentative 
approval he had given last week to the purchase of cmampws 
northsouth line for 215 million by rio grande industries inc 
the parent of southern pacific railroad 
the sale was endangered with the threat of a shutdown in 
service late tuesday when negotiations hit a snag cmampw trustee 
daniel murray said 
the snag occurred when norfolk southern corp the joint owner 
of facilities with cmampw demanded at least 350000 from contracts 
signed before cmampw declared bankruptcy in april 1988 murray said 
but that dispute and several other minor ones were resolved 
wednesday he said 
the closing is in the process of being completed right now 
he said late wednesday afternoon we reached a resolution of the 
dispute with norfolk amp western after negotiations last night and 
this morning 
norfolk southern is the parent of norfolk amp western railway co 
murray did not provide details on how the problem was resolved 
there will be continuation of service on the line from kansas 
city to st louis he said southern pacific will take over the 
northsouth line service will continue uninterrupted 
cmampw has 632 miles of track from kansas city to joliet with 
trackage rights into chicago the purchase affects the 282mile 
line running roughly from st louis to chicago 
murray had said tuesday that if negotiations to resolve the 
dispute were not completed before the parties went before schwartz 
on wednesday the judge would probably have ordered the entire 
railroad shut down at midnight 
about 100 businesses in illinois and missouri would have been 
affected by a shutdown an estimated 300000 people annually also 
travel by amtrak on cmampw track between chicago and st louis 
the sale of the northsouth line to rio grande came during 
eleventhhour negotiations last week state officials stepped in to 
mediate the deal and avert a possible shutdown 
citicorp north america inc and heller financial inc cmampws 
chief creditors had asked the court to cancel the cmampw contract 
with amtrak on the northsouth line because they said the railroad 
was continuing to lose money on passenger service and had no 
prospects for a successful reorganization 
murray said those creditors appeared to accept the deal and 
voiced no objections in court 
rio grande agreed to pay 1 million in startup expenses and 
assume responsibility for 11 million in loans the state of 
illinois made last year to keep struggling cmampw afloat 
the state in turn agreed to reduce interest rates on the 
existing loans and extend their payoff periods as well as forgive 
another 25 million loan by changing it to a grant 
negotiations continued with wertheim schroder amp co which seeks 
to purchase the cmampw eastwest lines that are used to haul freight 
between st louis and kansas city 
the wertheim cash proposal was expected to go before schwartz on 
dec 4 murray said
