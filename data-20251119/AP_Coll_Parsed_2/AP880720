us agriculture secretary richard lyng said 
wednesday he expects congress to pass droughtassistance 
legislation by midaugust but farmers shouldnt expect any help 
until at least october 
i think there will probably be some farmers hanging on the 
edge that may have a terrible time staying in business lyng 
said i hope it will not be a large number 
lyng spoke at a news conference held on one of the farms he 
toured as part of a threeday 10state sweep through areas hard 
hit by the drought of 88 
after stops in iowa and missouri lyng toured farms in north and 
south dakota saying the two states seemed even harder hit than the 
corn belt 
wherever weve gone the effects of the drought are very 
apparent but i must say in the dakotas the problem seems much 
worse lyng said as he toured wheat and barley fields on the farm 
of ed and paul schlosser near spiritwood nd 110 miles east of 
bismarck 
hours later lyng arrived for the night in central minnesota 
inspected a cornfield and said the damage there was the worst he 
has seen in the eight states he had visited 
weve seen other corn that is hurting but i dont think it 
was quite as bad as it is here lyng told edgar traut whose 
family owns and operates a 320acre dairy farm in st cloud 
trauts son dennis 29 said his 170acre corn crop which is only 
waisthigh was of doubtful value even for silage 
you cant come to a farm like this without having some 
emotional impact he said you have to worry about the families 
that are affected 
lyng was scheduled thursday to travel on to wisconisn and 
michigan 
the promise of federal aid did little to encourage one farmer 
theres not much you can do he cant make it rain said joe 
cerveny who farms 160 acres of corn and soybeans south of cedar 
rapids im 72 years old and ive never seen it like this 
lyng looked at a corn crop on kenneth bonttys eastern iowa farm 
and said it was among the hardest hit by the lack of moisture 
its some of the worst corn weve seen in terms of potential 
yield lyng said perhaps the government can come through with 
drought assistance but it doesnt help the corn now 
it is a terrible loss it really is lyng said 
some farmers said teasing rains in the past few weeks had 
skipped the driest parts of iowa 
weve had rain one or two times a week but its just been too 
spotty said stuart towe who farms 550 acres 
lyng toured farms in missouri earlier wednesday and said the 
nations crops will probably suffer severe damage despite recent 
rain 
there is a lot of damage and loss he said in a lot of 
fields there is grave doubt that there will be any harvest 
lyng said it was too early to estimate the dollar loss caused by 
the drought however he said he and a task force will discuss 
their findings after returning to washington dc later this 
week he said he will report monday to president reagan 
lyng continued to resist pleas to allow livestock to graze on 
federal conservation reserve program land despite renewed requests 
from iowa gov terry branstad he also renewed his promise that no 
embargoes on grain would be enforced as a result of the drought 
lyng began his tour tuesday with stops in ohio indiana and 
tennessee

the exile nicaraguan 
resistance movement ended a threeday meeting tuesday with the 
contra military leader wellplaced to influence its political 
policies and relations with washington 
col enrique bermudez 56 a former colonel in the late 
president anastasio somozas army was elected by a 442 vote 
monday night to the sevenmember directorate that oversees the 
usbacked insurgency against the leftist sandinista government 
late tuesday a small homemade bomb exploded outside the hotel 
where the nicaraguan resistance met police said no one was 
injured in the blast which occurred about nine hours after the 
meeting ended 
police maj bueno jiminian said no one had claimed 
responsibility for the bombing police would not speculate on who 
set off the bomb 
bermudezs position was further enhanced by the reelection of 
his closest ally on the directorate aristedes sanchez and of 
alfredo cesar who spoke strongly in favor of his candidacy 
newly elected director wilfredo montalvan also was seen as a 
bermudez supporter but the allegiances of roberto ferrey and 
wycliffe diego were less clear ferrey replaces his sister 
azucena who decided not to seek reelection and diego fills a 
vacant seat representing nicaraguas atlantic coast indians and 
creoles 
bermudez won a second vacant seat 
adolfo calero 56 who as the directorates senior member had 
been regarded as its political head also was reelected he is a 
rival of bermudez 
at a news conference tuesday calero dismissed suggestions that 
the colonels election would lessen chances that the us congress 
will resume military aid to the contras 
we elected a directorate to manage the organization calero 
said we didnt elect people to appeal for the aid 
congress cut off military aid to the contras in february but 
the sandinista governments recent crackdown on political 
opposition in nicaragua has given the contras new hope that the 
united states will resume the flow of weapons and ammunition 
in juigalpa nicaragua on tuesday the ninth anniversary of the 
sandinistas in power president daniel ortega said government 
leaders are socialists and theres socialism in nicaragua since 
1979 
both bermudez and calero said bermudez a professional soldier 
would confine himself to military matters acting as a 
quasidefense secretary on the previously allcivilian political 
directorate 
but bermudez skirted questions about whether he would relinquish 
his military command of the 17000 rebel troops saying only that 
the directorate had not yet considered the matter 
pedro joaquin chamorro who was ousted from the directorate by 
montalvan said he thought bermudez was determined to take absolute 
control of the resistance movement 
i dont think he has total control but that his clearly his 
intention said chamorro a 36yearold former nicaraguan 
journalist 
a reagan administration official who was at the conference as 
an observer said washington would not object to bermudez election 
to the directorate which sets overall policy for the resistance 
movement 
its not enrique bermudez as one man equals the directorate 
the ultimate decisions rests with all seven directors said the 
official on condition of anonymity 
the resistance movement has been split by feuding between 
bermudez supporters and dissidents who accuse him of being too 
close to former backers of somoza 
the nicaraguan resistance assembly is composed of exile 
representatives of political parties and labor business and ethnic 
groups in nicaragua 
in april calero and chamorro sided with dissidents who tried 
but failed to strip bermudez of his military command after he fired 
six commanders in honduras for mutiny 
bermudez said he sought a position on the directorate to regroup 
and unify the movement and give a political voice to the rebel 
forces in the field he denied having any ambition for control of 
the movement and insisted he would confine himself to military 
matters 
he said said he is willing to resume negotiations for peace if 
the sandinistas live up to promises to institute democratic reforms 
in nicaragua

the governments of angola south africa and cuba 
have approved an agreement in principle for the withdrawal of 
foreign troops from angola and majority rule in namibia according 
to a published report 
the new york times citing unidentified foreign diplomats and 
american officials reported in its wednesday editions that the 
three countries had informed the united states of their acceptance 
of the principles the reagan administration planned to announce 
the development on wednesday the newspaper said 
the statement of principles was initialed by cuban angolan 
and south african negotiators last wednesday at talks held in new 
york and mediated by chester crocker us undersecretary of state 
for african affairs 
the statement called for cuban troops to leave the marxistruled 
southern african nation of angola and for south africa to end its 
73year rule over namibia but did not set a timetable crocker 
said the text of the statement was not made public 
the principles required the approval of the three governments 
after which military and political experts from those nations would 
meet in august to work out details for a settlement 
south africa has said it would accept a un security council 
resolution calling for the independence of southwest africa 
commonly called namibia when the estimated 50000 cuban troops 
withdraw from neighboring angola 
the united states was a party to the talks because it has been 
supporting anticommunist rebels in angola with funds and weapons 
since 1985 angola has been fighting a civil war since it gained 
independence from portugal in 1975 battling anticommunist rebels 
in the south who call themselves unita for national union for the 
total independence of angola 
south africa has repeatedly sent troops from namibia into angola 
to support unita forces in the fighting 
the us goal is a full cuban troop withdrawal in one year the 
same time span that un resolution 435 sets for granting 
independence to namibia angola and cuba had insisted that cuban 
withdrawal take place over four years 
south africa has ruled namibia since world war i under a league 
of nations mandate to administer the territory the leagues 
successor the united nations revoked that mandate

over the past two weeks washington has been 
sending two strong messages to asia the united states is not a 
declining economic power and it has no intention of pulling its 
forces from the eastern pacific rim 
the messenger is george p shultz making his last and longest 
trip to asia since becoming us secretary of state in 1982 
starting july 6 shultz visited thailand malaysia indonesia 
the philippines hong kong china south korea and japan by and 
large it was a successful farewell 
addressing nations whose economic wellbeing would be 
jeopardized if america goes into a downward spin shultz maintained 
that despite the worlds largest trade deficit the united states 
enjoys a stronger economy today than ever before in its history 
despite recent antiamerican demonstrations in south korea and 
the philippines virtually all the regions leaders reportedly told 
shultz they want a substantial us presence in asia military 
economic and political 
if any anxiety was expressed it was over perceived american 
political wavering growing protectionism and isolationist trends 
that asian leaders fear could leave the asian field fallow for the 
soviet union and eventually for china and japan said us 
officials who took part in the talks 
that was the message to us all over the united states has 
great responsibilities and you have to assume those 
responsibilities gaston sigur the departments top asian 
official said in an interview nobody is asking us to come out 
here to be dictators but you have to be involved and i dont see 
any intention on our part not to be involved 
in the philippines shultz talks with president corazon aquino 
who has become a personal friend and with other leaders apparently 
helped hurdle problems in assessing us naval and air bases in 
that country 
manila is pressing for more than the 180 million a year the 
us now pays for the bases shultz appeared willing to make some 
compromises but has refused to regard the compensation merely as 
rent due an ally 
the treaty covering americas largest bases outside its mainland 
is up for renewal in 1991 shultz stressed that the united states 
would relocate the facilities elsewhere in the asiapacific area if 
the antibase movement succeeds 
in south korea he pledged americas 42000 troops will help 
ward off any attack if north korea opts to disrupt the olympic 
games in seoul and us officials expressed satisfaction that 
security arrangements with japan where 60000 american troops are 
stationed remain solid 
americas resolve to help our korean ally repel aggression 
from the north is as firm now as when we signed our mutual defense 
treaty in 1953 shultz said in a speech in seoul radicals have 
been demanding that all american forces leave the divided peninsula 
sigur the departments assistant secretary for east asian and 
pacific affairs said manila and seoul were not moving away from 
security ties with the united states but toward redefining how 
close they should be 
they want to have more of a say in defining it thats fine 
sigur said it may cause us a bit of heartburn here and there but 
its a good healthy attitude 
china and noncommunist southeast asian nations sigur said 
similarly signaled their desire for a us counterbalance given 
unsettled chinesesoviet relations the conflict in cambodia and a 
potential threat from the big soviet military base at cam ranh bay 
in vietnam 
in beijing shultz acknowledged that he was unable to dissuade 
chinese leaders from selling ballistic missiles in the middle east 
but he emphasized that the two countries have forged mature 
relations across a broad spectrum and the chinese agreed 
the two sides appeared to reach broad agreement on a political 
settlement in cambodia although it remains unclear how china will 
deal with the khmer rouge whom they currently supply with weapons 
shultz called for the withdrawal of all vietnamese forces from 
cambodia voiced strong support for cambodian resistance leader 
prince norodom sihanouk and expressed american abhorrence of the 
khmer rouge 
the khmer rouge now in a threeparty rebel alliance killed 
millions of cambodians during its rule from 1975 until the 
vietnamese invaded in 1978 
on almost every stop shultz a former economics professor 
lauded free trade and linked economic successes in asia to the 
unhindered flow of goods and ideas 
in a rare moment of public combativeness shultz lashed out at 
south korea for keeping its doors shut to american exports 
if my statement causes antiamericanism so be it he said 
shultz cited a host of statistics to show how tightly the 
american and asian economies are enmeshed 
the united states for example is market for more than 50 
percent of manufactured exports from noncommunist southeast asia 
exports to the united states have fueled south koreas dramatic 
growth and helped to sustain japans at a combined cost to the us 
of about 70 billion in trade deficits 
but while this reliance on the american market has reaped big 
rewards for asia it has also spawned anxiety asian leaders 
attacked pending us legislation that would restrict imports and 
freetrader shultz shared their displeasure

a day at the races became an affair of state in 
france when the government ordered a betting concern to pay about 
10 million to gamblers bilked of their winnings when a tracks 
tote board flashed the wrong numbers 
the office of premier michel rocard said people who had bet on 
the right horse at the maisonslaffitte tracks prix de strasbourg 
on sunday but went away emptyhanded would collect after all those 
who collected winnings based on the miscall can also keep their 
money 
the announcement came after a meeting tuesday between 
representatives of the budget and agricultural ministries and 
racetrack officials 
following the error in the announcing of the prix de 
strasbourg results the state considers that measures must be 
taken in favor of bettors who were victims of this situation the 
premiers office said in a statement 
the real winning numbers of sundays race were 148511 but a 
judge who scrutinized a photo finish inadvertently called out 
148115 and it was those numbers that went up on the tote board 
the error was recognized shortly afterward but too late to make 
reparations according to the racing code winning tickets are 
those which match the numbers on the tote board right or wrong 
officials estimated that the staterun betting concern will have 
to pay out about 10 million to rectify the error but some race 
track habitues interviewed on the evening news are already 
groaning saying they and many like them had thrown out their 
winning tickets 
bettors who won with the wrong numbers collected about 360 each

a prosecutor decides he wont seek an 
indictment but tells the world that the subject of his 
investigation attorney general edwin meese iii probably broke 
the law 
why wasnt meese charged with a crime and was it unfair of 
independent counsel james mckay to announce that the attorney 
general likely violated two criminal tax statutes and on two 
occasions a federal conflictofinterest provision 
if this happened in a routine case if us attorney rudy 
giuliani said ive been investigating abc brokerage house and 
ive concluded they violated the law and i could probably convince 
a jury but im not going to indict thats not a proper use of 
prosecutorial power said stephen gillers a new york university 
law professor and ethics expert 
in that context theres something to meeses argument that 
mckay treated him unfairly gillers said but i think mckay and 
meese are a different animal mckay has an obligation to explain 
the reasons for his actions the attorney general gets extra 
scrutiny and that comes with the territory 
others particularly conservatives disagree 
what mckay has done is turn the office of independent counsel 
into an engine to destroy reputations without any judicial trial 
said bruce fein an associate deputy attorney general in 198182 
and formerly with the conservative heritage foundation its an 
absolute disgrace and blatantly unconstitutional civil 
libertarians should be denouncing this 
meese said he was outraged and appalled by mckays finding that 
he probably broke the law 
its profoundly ironic that the attorney general is attacking 
the integrity of mr mckay for exercising some discretion in his 
meeses favor by not prosecuting said louis seidman a 
professor of law at georgetown university it seems to me that 
the existence of the special prosecutor law the 1978 ethics in 
government act has allowed the exercise of prosecutorial 
discretion if meese had been cleared by a subordinate in the 
justice department there would be a major scandal 
the law setting up the independent counsel process allows him 
to give meese a break which he may well deserve seidman said 
as to why meese wasnt prosecuted on tax violations guidelines 
in the justice departments tax division and the internal revenue 
service spell out terms under which prosecution of cases may be 
authorized noted gerald feffer a criminal tax lawyer with 
williams amp connolly who as a deputy assistant attorney general 
from 1979 to 1981 oversaw criminal tax cases in the justice 
department 
the relatively small amount of tax meese owed 3479 and the 
fact that meeses tax problems stemmed from a single instance 
rather than a pattern of failing to report capital gains point 
against prosecution 
in addition mckay found evidence that meese had intended to 
file an amended return and in fact meese did so in february 
albeit nearly a year and a half late and in the midst of a criminal 
investigation 
in the tax area unlike any other area there is a national 
review process that goes forward to provide uniformity and to 
examine each case with structured standards of prosecution said 
feffer who says prosecution would not have been instituted in 
similar circumstances against a less prominent taxpayer 
mckays report found that meese probably twice violated the 
conflictofinterest law by participating as attorney general in 
matters affecting the telecommunications industry while he was 
holding regional bell telephone stock 
instead of selling his phone holdings as he had promised the 
senate and office of government ethics meese unable to find the 
certificates signed an agreement transferring the stock to his 
investment manager he then met with regional bell executives and 
supported legislation sought by many in the industry while 
continuing to receive stock dividend checks which he didnt cash 
just before making a decision favorable to the regional bell 
companies meese obtained a white house waiver allowing him to 
participate in the matter despite his holdings 
the conflictofinterest law prohibits personal and substantial 
participation by an official in a particular matter in which to 
his knowledge he or his spouse has a financial interest 
mckay decided not to prosecute after concluding there was no 
evidence meese acted from motivation for personal gain mckay 
pointed out the attorney general took steps though ineffective 
ones to divest himself of the stock 
the conflictofinterest law is a tough statute said robert 
luskin a private washington attorney who was special counsel to 
the organized crime section of the justice department from 1980 to 
1982 if the question was did a guy lie to somebody you dont 
have much trouble on a statute like that but i sort of defy 
anybody reading the conflictofinterest provisions in close cases 
to say which side of the line conduct falls 
kenneth s geller a former deputy solicitor general and member 
of the watergate prosecution team said public officials should 
be held to a higher standard but it would be wrong i believe to 
hold them to a standard of absolute liability there still has to 
be some discretion exercised on whether or not to bring criminal 
charges

a major pentagon contractor is firing all its 
defense consultants and shaking up management of one division based 
on an internal investigation separate from the massive government 
bribery inquiry now being presented to a federal grand jury 
the federal grand jury in alexandria va heads into its second 
day of closeddoor testimony today with a chief prosecutor 
promising there wont be any luminaries testifying soon 
meanwhile unisys corp the giant computer company based in 
blue bell pa announced that an internal investigation of its 
defense consultants by former watergate special prosecutor henry 
ruth had uncovered possibly unethical activity in one division 
unisys chairman w michael blumenthal said the company began the 
ruth investigation last fall without knowledge of the nearly 
2yearold federal investigation which was first revealed by 
coordinated fbi searches on june 14 
no one has been charged in the investigation of the 
150billionayear pentagon purchasing system but government 
documents allege that some defense contractors and consultants 
bribed pentagon officials for contracting details vital to winning 
contracts worth billions of dollars 
at unisys blumenthal placed a long island ny division under 
new management put some employees on administrative leave and 
terminated all consulting contracts with those who represented 
the compkn before the federal government on defenserelated 
matters 
a unisys plant on long island was searched by federal agents 
june 14 as were the offices or homes of several unisys employees 
and consultants unisys was formed by the 48 billion 1986 merger 
of sperry and burroughs 
in alexandria an attorney for defense consultant and former 
navy official melvyn paisley filed motions tuesday to quash 11 
subpoenas from the grand jury and to be advised if the government 
conducted any illegal electronic surveillance of his client 
in all 275 subpoenas mostly for documents and records were to 
be answered in alexandria on tuesday sharon dibbley spokeswoman 
for us attorney henry hudson said the government had arranged a 
location which she would not identify where those under subpoena 
could deliver records without being observed by reporters 
many of the subpoenas are to people who are only potential 
witnesses not targets of the investigation 
ms dibbley had no comment on the paisley motion and knew of no 
objections filed to the other subpoenas 
the only recognizable figure arriving for tuesdays session of 
the grand jury in the us courthouse was jack a sherman a 
civilian marine corps employee whose office was searched by federal 
agents june 14 
sherman who sources said was transferred to nonprocurement 
duties pending the outcome of the investigation was a supervisory 
contracts negotiator for the marines installation and logistics 
office 
neither sherman nor his attorney would comment it could not be 
determined if he was actually brought before the grand jury 
other witnesses however were seen entering and leaving the 
grand jury room later in the day tuesday afternoon assistant us 
attorney joseph aronica who is in charge of the grand jury told 
reporters there wont be any luminaries soon 
paisleys attorney e lawrence barcella said he filed a motion 
to quash the 11 subpoenas issued for paisley who served as 
assistant navy secretary for research engineering and systems from 
december 1981 to april 1987 when he became a consultant 
barcella said we asked the government to affirm or deny 
whether they used illegal electronic surveillance even the fact 
that they may have gotten authorization does not mean their wiretap 
was applied for and carried out in a legal manner before we comply 
with a subpoena we want to insure that the government has carried 
out its responsibilities under the wiretap statute in an 
appropriate and accurate manner 
earlier this month the government released its search warrant 
for paisley which indicated that fbi agents were investigating 
whether he received payments from general dynamics mcdonnell 
douglas and pratt amp whitney while he worked for the pentagon the 
warrant also showed the government is investigating consulting he 
has since done for 10 defense contractors 
at unisys blumenthal told his employees by letter that the 
company pledged full cooperation with hudsons investigation and 
we expect and encourage each of our employees also to cooperate 
fully in responding to the governments inquiries 
the new management was installed at the former sperry 
surveillance and fire control division in great neck ny on long 
island the division employs 2500 of unisys 90000 employees and 
had beforetax profits of 18 million in 1987 on 300 million in 
revenue 
in addition to the great neck plant federal agents also 
searched offices or homes of charles gardner consultant and former 
general manager and vice president at the unisys great neck plant 
dennis mitchell administrative aide at the plant william galvin 
a unisys consultant and paisley who also worked for unisys 
mitchell is reported by several newspapers to have handed checks 
to rep roy dyson dmd as campaign contributions during a tour 
he made of the unisys plant a year ago those checks and others 
later mailed totaled 14000 the reports said 
blumenthal said senior managers would henceforth approve all 
consulting agreements and honoraria paid to members of congress he 
also hired a washington law firm to aid in enforcing an ethics 
program

us officials are conducting a serious 
investigation into the defection to the soviet union of a former 
navy enlisted man and reservist who had access to valuable 
satellite intelligence data 
we are quite concerned about what he might have given the 
soviets a navy source said after glenn michael souther 31 
appeared on soviet television tuesday 
souther disappeared in may 1986 after he was confronted by 
federal agents in an espionage investigation 
during his tv appearance souther said the fbi had hounded him 
out of the country the soviet government newspaper izvestia 
reported sunday that he had been granted asylum in that country 
souther had access to classified information while assigned to 
europe and later while on reserve duty in norfolk va said the 
navy official who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
among the duties that souther had in the navy was analyzing data 
collected by satellites access to that sort of information would 
tell the soviets what capabilities the united states has to 
photograph their installations and intercept their communications 
using satellites and also what areas us intelligence was 
monitoring 
an investigation is under way pentagon spokesman dan howard 
told reporters it is a serious investigation 
souther enlisted in the navy in january 1976 then left active 
duty in 1982 after being denied entrance into officer candidate 
school according to navy sources 
while on active duty he served aboard the aircraft carrier uss 
nimitz from july 1976 to november 1978 and was assigned to the 6th 
fleet command in naples italy in april 1979 where navy sources 
said he would have had access to some intelligence data involving 
soviet military activities in europe 
following an honorable discharge in october 1982 souther 
remained in the reserves as an intelligence specialist 
on weekends he worked at the headquarters of the 2nd fleet 
command in norfolk va a position that may have given him access 
to classified information sources said 
after leaving active service souther enrolled in old dominion 
university in norfolk where he majored in russian language 
soviet reports of the defection did not indicate when souther 
had arrived in the soviet union whether he had spied for the 
soviet union before he left the united states or whether he was 
cooperating presently with soviet intelligence 
during his appearance on soviet television souther said he 
found himself confronted with a fateful decision i had to leave 
my country my family close friends and relatives 
my guilt is that i regarded my convictions and interests as my 
natural rights but the fbi thought otherwise i was persecuted and 
my freedom was threatened he said 
an announcer on the main soviet television news evening program 
vremya said a special broadcast would be made wednesday night 
to better acquaint viewers with southers case 
in november 1986 william webster then director of the fbi 
told reporters that souther was the target of an espionage 
investigation 
fbi officials said sunday that souther had been under 
surveillance before his disappearance in may 1986 but declined to 
give further details of the case 
souther disappeared after visiting his mother in the midwest 
and telling friends that he was going to visit a child he had by 
his former wife an italian

the federal judge handling the irancontra 
case is expressing frustration at having to mediate frequent 
pretrial disputes between lawyers for the government and the 
defense 
why is it that the most simple things cant be talked out 
among counsel judge gerhard a gesell asked at a hearing tuesday 
on several motions why does it have to come to me 
weve got to some way act like human beings to get this case 
started 
gesell complained of receiving a number of motions from both 
sides seeking information from one another routine matters on 
which attorneys normally reach agreement during conferences 
i hope to some extent you will work these things out he 
said 
in one instance barry simon an attorney for retired marine lt 
col oliver north sought documents prepared by the israeli 
government and given to the independent counsels office at the 
hearing prosecutors agreed to provide the defense with classified 
documents setting out a chonology of events involving israeli 
officials and citizens in the secret sale of arms to iran 
that was when gesell asked why such matters couldnt be worked 
out without his involvement 
gesell also was taken aback when simon announced that he planned 
to seek a delay in the start of norths trial scheduled to begin 
sept 20 
when are you going to file that motion he asked 
simon promised to file the motion today adding that it would 
contain his reasons for seeking the delay 
and i suppose you will want to file a reply gesell then 
said to independent counsel lawrence e walsh who answered in the 
affirmative 
the judge scheduled a hearing for next wednesday on the proposed 
delay in the start of norths trial 
gesell also made a preliminary decision to have another judge 
handle the trial of another of the four defendants in the case 
former national security adviser john poindexter to protect his 
right to a speedy trial 
with all four defendants to be tried separately walsh earlier 
had announced his intention to present the case against north 
first a strategy which could delay poindexters trial for months 
gesell said if he were convinced that a delay in norths trial 
was essential he might decide to proceed with poindexters trial 
first rather than having another judge take that case 
earlier gesell had told poindexters lawyers if mr 
poindexter wants a judge assigned to him and to go to trial right 
away ill arrange it 
despite objections from walsh gesell said i do feel that if 
someone wants a trial i dont want to stand in their way its the 
right of the defendant to have a speedy trial i dont 
understand that i have any authority to defer a trial of a man who 
wants one 
as pretrial jockeying continued richard beckler poindexters 
defense attorney said he is readying 10 to 15 different motions on 
behalf of his client 
defense and prosecution lawyers agreed during the hearing to 
work out a procedure for obtaining handwriting samples from the 
defendants a step walsh has said is essential to his case 
but gesell balked at a prosecution request to have new 
photographs made of north poindexter and the two other defendants 
richard secord and albert hakim calling such a step very 
unusual 
north and the other defendants are facing trial on a variety of 
charges including conspiracy to defraud the government by 
illegally diverting the proceeds of the sale of us arms to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels

farm people not only keep getting fewer in 
numbers each year they are older include more males than females 
and are more likely to live in the midwest than they once were 
says a new government study 
as for their fading numbers its an old story that was repeated 
again last year when an estimated 240000 people left the land 
dropping the nations farm population to the lowest level since 
before the civil war 
officials said an average of 4986000 people one out of every 
49 americans lived on farms in 1987 representing 2 percent of 
the us population of 2434 million 
that compared with 5226000 farm residents in 1986 which was 
22 percent of the national population of 2411 million 
the figures were derived from an annual survey by the census 
bureau that was released jointly on tuesday with the agriculture 
department a preliminary report was issued on feb 8 
although the 1987 farm population estimate was down by 240000 
people the report said that represented no statistically 
significant change from 1986 the oneyear decline would have had 
to have been at least 275000 for it be statistically significant 
the report said 
from 1981 through 1987 the farm population declined an average 
of 25 percent annually the report said in the previous decade 
the annual decline averaged 29 percent 
the report said the 1920 census is regarded as the beginning of 
the governments official nose count of the farm population 
although estimates go back much earlier 
in one table for example figures on the number of americans in 
farm occupations go back to 1820 when farm people were 
reported at less than 21 million making up about 72 percent of 
the us work force of 29 million 
by 1850 there were 49 million farm people representing about 
64 percent of the nations 77 million workers 
the farm population in 1920 when the official census data 
began was nearly 32 million or 302 percent of the us 
population of 1057 million the report showed 
according to usda estimates going back to 1910 however the 
farm population peaked at 325 million people in 1916 during world 
war i making up 32 percent of the population of 1016 million 
despite a general downward trend since world war i the farm 
population has had a few shortlived surges including one during 
the great depression when it grew to 312 million in 1933 
comprising 249 percent of the us population of 1254 million 
that year 
another slight bulge appeared in 1983 as thousands shifted from 
city living to the countryside raising the farm population to more 
than 7 million from 688 million in 1982 
some other observations included in the 1987 farm population 
report 
half of the total farm population lives in the midwest the 
south has 29 percent the west 15 percent and the northeast 6 
percent officials said reliable state and local farm popuation 
figures were not available 
at midcentury about a third of all farm people lived in the 
midwest while slightly more than half were in the south a rapid 
decline of the souths farm population rather than any growth in 
the midwest led to the shift 
as compared with the nonfarm population the farm population 
has a higher proportion of whites 97 percent blacks are 25 
percent of the farm population and other races 06 percent 
those are approximate figures hispanics who may be of any race 
made up 27 percent of the farm population the report said 
comparatively the us nonfarm population last year was 844 
percent white 123 percent black and 33 percent other races the 
census bureau said hispanics comprised 81 percent 
the median age of farm residents was 376 years in 1987 which 
is significantly higher than the nonfarm median of 32 years 
the median age is that from which half of the people are older and 
half are younger 
in the 1920 census when data on the farm population were 
first collected their median age was 207 years lower than the 
medians for the rural total and the urban population the report 
said 
last year there were 109 males per 100 females living on 
farms compared with just 93 males per 100 females in the nonfarm 
population in 1920 the farm ratio was the same while the 
nonfarm ratio was 102 males per 100 females

a major association of country banks says it 
supports droughtaid legislation in congress that would pour up to 
7 billion into stricken areas to help farmers recover from crop 
and livestock losses 
the independent bankers association of america which says that 
half its members are agricultural banks sent letters to members of 
the senate and house agricultural committees in support of bills 
awaiting final action when congress returns to work on july 26 
a version approved by the senate committee would provide 
payments of up to 100000 to droughtstricken farmers president 
reagan has indicated he would sign such legislation 
association presidentelect o jay tomson charles city iowa 
said tuesday a special committee concluded that the legislation 
deserves our full support and prompt enactment 
basically the legislation would replace a major portion of the 
income lost by crop farmers in 1988 due to heat and drought by 
reallocating money that would otherwise have gone to farmers as 
deficiency payments to compensate them for low commodity prices 
drought has cut production and forced up prices meaning the 
payments will be less thus the savings would be used to 
finance the drought benefits 
in addition livestock dairy and poultry producers would be 
provided financial aid to help cover higher feed costs and help 
them keep their foundation stock

us officials say they are intrigued by a 
sudden interest shown by cuban authorities in reaching an agreement 
on the withdrawal of the almost 50000 cuban troops from angola 
this was one of several signs that emerged from a meeting last 
week which have given the administration fresh hope that an 
agreement leading to the withdrawal of all foreign forces from 
southwestern africa may be possible 
at the meeting in new york officials from south africa cuba 
and angola signed a tentative agreement on a statement of 
principles that would govern future negotiations for comprehensive 
troop withdrawals 
barring an unexpected snag the three governments were expected 
to announce final approval of the statement today and make it 
public 
the united states is serving as a mediator in the talks which 
began in early may for the past seven years the reagan 
administration has attempted to find a formula that would lead to 
both a cuban troop withdrawal from angola and independence and 
black majority rule for namibia a colony of south africa 
the cubans have added up to 15000 troops to their military 
presence in angola since last fall but at the same time have shown 
a much greater willingness to work out an agreement on a total 
withdrawal said the officials insisting on anonymity 
among south africas many foreign critics few have been more 
outspoken than cuba but the tone of last weeks meeting indicated a 
strong desire for a settlement the officials said 
the cubans are saying to south africans its not a question 
of victory and defeat its a question of building peace and 
south africa is saying we agree with you one senior official 
said the angolans agreed with them both 
cuban troops initially were sent to angola in 1975 to protect 
the fledgling marxist government there against south african 
military incursions south african troops are continuing to support 
an americanbacked rebel group in angola and years of us effort 
to promote a settlement foundered until last week in the process 
the angolan economy has declined steadily and there has been 
considerable loss of life 
the officials are uncertain as to why cuba now seems more 
agreeable to withdrawing its forces one possible explanation is 
pressure from the soviet union which earlier this year agreed to 
withdraw its forces from afghanistan and wields substantial 
influence over cuba and angola two of moscows closest allies and 
largest aid recipients 
the official said cuba is either negotiating seriously or 
making an effort to create that impression 
he added that if cuba agrees to withdraw its troops from angola 
in return for a similar move by south africa and a commitment by 
pretoria to decolonize namibia the cubans could go home with 
their heads held high 
the biggest remaining obstacle is a timetable for the mutual 
troop withdrawals 
under a united nations resolution the independence process in 
namibia would be carried out over a oneyear time frame once south 
africa consents to that step that timetable is considered 
nonnegotiable 
but south africa with us backing has said the south african 
withdrawal will not take place unless cuba agrees to withdraw its 
forces simultaneously 
in effect that appears to mean cuba would have to agree to 
roughly a oneyear withdrawal timetable or there is no agreement 
as an opening bargaining position cuba and angola have talked 
of a fouryear period for the cuban pullback but both sides have 
indicated flexibility on that point 
the official said the question of a timetable will be discussed 
in early august during the next meeting of the four countries 
i want to force that discussion to take place the official 
said we need to have that conversation now

republican strategists are unfazed by an 
expected boost in the polls for michael dukakis due to his exposure 
at the democratic national convention predicting a tight 
presidential race over the long haul 
i think its going to be a very late election to a certain 
extent because i dont think voters are focusing on the election 
and i dont think they care too much about it said lee atwater 
campaign manager for vice president george bush 
atwater said tuesday a boost in dukakis popularity is probable 
in the wake of the convention and gop consultant roger stone 
predicted it would be an artificial boost maybe as much as 7 to 
10 points 
stone noted that walter mondale the 1984 democratic 
presidential nominee received a large push in the polls from the 
partys convention in san francisco but it was a shortlived gain 
all of it dissipated within three weeks after the 
convention stone said it is beneficial to george bush that 
the republican convention is second 
david carmen a gop consultant and former adviser to new york 
rep jack kemps presidential campaign said bush is in far better 
shape now than was former president gerald ford in 1976 ford 
trailed democrat jimmy carter by 30 points after the democratic 
convention 
im not so certain dukakis is going to get quite the boost out 
of the convention everybody thinks carmen said he may get 
only three points or so and that would be a real victory for our 
side 
bush has halted what was perceived as a decline in the polls 
and now has risen back up so its clear that hes not going to 
come out of the democratic convention so far down that it will be 
irrecoverable carmen said 
gop advisers said they were buoyed by an abc survey taken on 
the eve of the convention that showed bush had 46 percent support 
compared to 45 percent for dukakis statistically a dead heat it 
was the first national poll since dukakis selection of sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas as his running mate 
earlier polls had shown dukakis with more than a 10point lead 
over bush 
a usa todaycable news network survey taken july 610 showed 47 
percent for bush 44 percent for dukakis 
what were seeing now is a natural tightening of the race 
stone said 
meanwhile bush campaign spokeswoman sheila tate said that the 
vice president fishing in wyoming with treasury secretary james a 
baker iii had no plans to watch or listen to the democratic 
national convention 
he wanted to stare at a fish eye not the cbs eye or the nbc 
peacock ms tate said 
although bush has been lying low since saturday on his trip with 
baker who is expected to become his campaign chairman the vice 
president was to reappear wednesday with two evening campaign 
appearances in the detroit area 
he had also had events scheduled in north carolina and south 
carolina on thursday the final day of the democratic convention

president reagans national security adviser 
says he does not believe the united states will ever withdraw all 
its naval forces from the persian gulf despite hopes of a 
ceasefire in the iraniraq war 
lt gen colin l powell answering questions during a rare 
speaking engagement before the los angeles world affairs council on 
tuesday also said prospects of a strategic arms reduction 
agreement with the soviets in this administration are growing 
dimmer each week 
on a question about the middle east he argued that the 
administrations sale of advanced f18 aircraft with maverick 
missiles to kuwait would be in the interests of israel because 
the united states would control how the airplanes are used 
on latin american affairs powell said the next president will 
probably face a situation of accelerating deterioration in 
central america unless congress approves effective aid for 
nicaraguas contra rebels 
he said the united states is continuing to try to find ways to 
convince panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega and his associates 
that noriega should step down 
and he said the united states will not allow the panama canal to 
be controlled by any future panamanian government that does not 
share the same strategic view that we do of the importance of 
freedom of navigation through the canal 
in his speech powell said panama continues to be a problem 
but we will continue to support the hopes for democracy in that 
troubled country 
when asked what avenues the united states was pursuing towards 
that goal he said economic sanctions and diplomatic efforts were 
continuing and we continue to try to find ways to convince 
noriega and others in power that the only solution is for noriega 
to step down 
the wideranging questionandanswer session followed a speech 
in which powell appealed to americans to remember that next jan 
20 we must come together in support of our new president whoever 
that may be 
powell made the speech while in california during president 
reagans weeklong vacation at his ranch north of santa barbara 
the white house said the national security adviser is giving the 
president daily briefings on the world situation 
the question of the persian gulf arose as powell was asked 
whether in view of continuing hostilities he was still encouraged 
by irans announcement that it will accept a yearold united 
nations ceasefire resolution 
i think we have to be encouraged by what iran did he said 
in my judgment it is a breakthrough but it is only a first 
step the war goes on 
however he said notwithstanding the fact that the fighting 
is still going on i am encouraged and hopeful that the general 
secretary of the united nations javier perez de cuellar will be 
successful in getting a ceasefire in place in the very near 
future 
when asked whether a ceasefire would bring about withdrawal of 
the us naval presence from the gulf powell said because of 
the importance of that waterway and our strategic interests in the 
region i do not see us ever removing our forces from the persian 
gulf 
the united states has maintained warships in the persian gulf 
since 1949 the typical force in most years was two destroyers 
on a strategic arms reduction treaty with the soviet union 
powell said we are working hard perhaps it can still be done 
but with each passing week it becomes much more difficult to see 
the outcome within this administration 
in regard to the f18 sale bitterly opposed by supporters of 
israel powell argued that the kuwaitis have a legitmate need 
for the aircraft and missiles and will obtain them elswhere if not 
from the united states 
the cash is in their pocket he said adding that if they 
buy the f18s from the united states we end up having a great 
deal of control over how the aircraft are used that is in our 
interest and in the interest of israel 
powell discussed central america among other issues in the body 
of his speech saying unless congress and the president which 
means ultimately the american people come to agreement on a 
program of effective aid for the nicaraguan resistance as an 
adjunct to our diplomatic strategy the next president will 
probably face a situation of accelerating deterioration as all the 
local democracies will come under growing strains as nicaragua 
growes stronger more assertive and more aggressive 
in response to a question about the panama canal treaties he 
said he thought the pacts were a good idea at the time but 
added that the united states is prepared to do what is necessary 
to keep the canal from ever being put at risk he said the 
waterway should be turned over only to a panamanian government 
that is responsive and that shows the same strong view that we do 
of the importance of freedom of navigation through the canal

during a luncheon in 1986 attorney general 
edwin meese iii told three men now under indictment in the wedtech 
scandal that he wanted to refinance his mortgage to take advantage 
of lower interest rates 
according to an 814page report issued this week by independent 
counsel james mckay one of meeses three lunch partners longtime 
friend e robert wallach stepped in to help contacting a 
washington banker that led to a 260000 mortgage loan for meese 
five months later from a financial institution in washington 
mckay examined the circumstances surrounding the jan 29 1986 
lunch between meese wallach meeses financial manager w franklyn 
chinn and wedtech consultant r kent london in an attempt to 
determine whether meese may have violated federal bribery or 
gratuity laws 
that same day the report notes londons company had been paid 
1 million by wedtech corp in compensation for services to the 
south bronx ny defense contractor 
in his report mckay concluded that no portion of the 1 million 
was passed on to meese and that the subsequent mortgage loan was 
not made under preferential terms 
mckay did not find grounds to indict meese but the attorney 
general now faces an inquiry by the justice departments office of 
professional responsibility the opr is expected to use mckays 
report as a basis for determining whether meese may have violated 
ethical standards for officials in the executive branch of 
government 
mckays report found that meese probably twice violated the 
conflictofinterest law by participating as attorney general in 
matters affecting the telecommunications industry while he was 
holding regional bell telephone stock 
a 1965 executive order setting out standards of ethical conduct 
for government officers directs that employees avoid any action 
which might create the appearance of giving preferential treatment 
to any organization or person losing complete independence or 
impartiality of action or affecting adversely the confidence of the 
public in the integrity of the government 
that executive order also prohibits any action which might 
create the appearance of making a government decision outside 
official channels 
mckay found that wallach engaged in a number of activities which 
were of substantial benefit to meese including representing 
meese without charge in connection with his nomination and 
confirmation hearings to become attorney general 
mckay also said wallach assisted in obtaining a paying job for 
meeses wife ursula and helped the meeses get an 80000 bank 
loan in 1983 as well as facilitating the 1986 loan of 260000 to 
refinance meeses mortgage 
mckay found that meese helped wallach by interceding on behalf 
of wedtech corp in 1981 in a move that culminated in a 32 million 
enginebuilding contract for the company and also by assisting the 
attorney in connection with a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline project 
at wallachs request the attorney general arranged a meeting 
between wallach and thennational security adviser robert mcfarlane 
and wallachs client swiss oilman bruce rappaport in 1985 in 
connection with the proposed oil pipeline 
opr is responsible for determining whether any violations of 
executive branch ethics standards and rules may have taken place 
it has the authority to issue reports on allegations of wrongdoing 
or unethical conduct and to recommend reprimand censure and in 
the case of current employees recommend dismissal 
wallach chinn and london face trial next jan 3 on charges of 
conspiracy fraud and racketeering which involve allegations that 
they attempted to use meese to help wedtech meese wasnt charged

jesse jackson saluted democratic nomineetobe 
michael dukakis on tuesday night as a rival who always resisted 
the temptation to stoop to demagoguery and called on his 
supporters to join him on common ground with dukakis for victory in 
the fall 
we meet tonight at a crossroads a point of decision shall we 
expand be inclusive find unity and power or suffer division and 
impotence jackson asked a packed hall the only time we win is 
when we come together 
jackson calling his own work ancient and endless never 
endorsed the massachusetts governor for the presidency in the 
50minute speech to the democratic national convention 
ill make the appropriate decision at the appropriate time 
jackson said afterward 
even without the endorsement the dukakis campaign termed the 
speech was terrific 
campaign manager susan estrich said i think everyone in the 
dukakis campaign tonight stands sidebyside with our friends in 
the jackson campaign 
after the address the final major speech of his remarkable 
1988 campaign for the white house jackson dived into the mass of 
delegates on the convention floor to shake hands and receive 
congratulations 
he had been scheduled to speak in prime television time but the 
platform debates sought by his forces pushed its start to the very 
last minute before 11 pm on the east coast 
jackson was introduced by his five children and by a brief film 
highlighting his campaign efforts 
to many he is a hero to us he is also our father said 
jesse l jackson jr 
jackson was greeted by a sea of red jesse jesse jesse 
signs as he walked to the podium with his wife jackie dukakis 
aides urged the blue dukakis signs be kept down during the speech 
and some dukakis delegates gave up their seats to jackson 
alternates to give them a better view of their candidate 
like never before jackson praised dukakis 
tonight i salute gov michael dukakis he said he has run 
a wellmanaged and dignified campaign no matter how tired or how 
tried he always resisted the temptation to stoop to demagoguery 
i have watched a good mind fast at work with steel nerves 
guiding his campaign out of the crowded field without appeal to the 
worst of us i have watched his perspective grow as his environment 
has expanded ive seen his toughness and tenacity close up 
over and over again jackson returned to the image that has been 
central to his second bid for the presidency common ground 
when we divide we cannot win so our challenge here is to 
find common ground jackson said 
as he has before jackson noted that he and dukakis had widely 
different backgrounds there are differences of religion region 
and race differences in experience and perspectives but the 
genius of america is that out of the many we become one he said 
his foreparents came to america in immigrant ships my 
foreparents came to america on slave ships but whatever the 
original ships we are both in the same boat tonight jackson 
said our ships could pass in the night if we have a false 
sense of independence they could collide and crash but we can 
seek a higher reality and a greater good at our highest we can 
call upon our noble instincts and navigate this vessel to safety 
after the long campaign jackson said he and dukakis have come 
together and share a common commitment to new priorities to 
expansion and to inclusion 
but he hinted there were still rough spots in the relationship 
there is a higher good beyond personal comfort or position 
the good of our nation is at stake he said 
jackson gave an emotional history of the civil rights movement 
that gave him his start and opened the door for his twin bids for 
the presidency 
my right and my privilege to stand here before you has been 
won in my lifetime by the blood and the sweat of the 
innocent he said 
dr martin luther king lies only a few miles from us 
jackson said tonight he must feel good as he looks down upon us 
his heart would be full tonight 
and jackson brought rosa parks whose refusal to sit in the back 
of a birmingham bus triggered kings rise to prominence to the 
podium saying all the delegates are really standing on her 
shoulders 
stressing unity jackson said the continuation of his campaign 
through the wednesday night roll call was a necessary step in 
history 
as a statement to the struggles of those who have gone before 
as a legacy for those who will come after as a tribute to the 
endurance the patience the courage of our forefathers and 
mothers as an assurance that their prayers are being answered 
their work was not in vain and hope is eternal tomorrow night my 
name will go into nomination for the presidency of the united 
states 
jackson made clear that his crusade is not over even after 
dukakis formally wins the partys nomination wednesday night 
my work to keep america strong and make america better is 
ancient and endless we can win jackson said 
jackson closed his speech with what has become a slogan for him 
and for his political efforts for the future 
keep hope alive keep hope alive keep hope alive 
before the speech jacksons supporters were predicting that 
emotions within the convention hall would reach an emotional peak 
when the civil rights leader stepped to the podium 
they might have to come take me out in an ambulance said 
alternate alvin dollar of decatur ga 
and afterward the reaction was positive 
the man is on target nobody can do it better said state 
rep al edwards of texas 
many of those who sought to hear jackson were denied entrance to 
the omni when the fire marshal declared the convention hall filled 
to capacity stranding hundreds of delegates guests and reporters 
some delegates were allowed to reenter the hall in time for the 
speech 
jacksons address recalled his performance at the 1984 
democratic convention in san francisco 
then at the end of his first bid for the presidency jackson 
brought the democratic delegates to theirfeet with tears in their 
eyes with his apology for the low moments of his historic run 
for the white house 
that was not my truest self jackson told a hushed san 
francisco hall four years ago if there were occasions when my 
grape turned into a raisin and my joy bell lost its resonance 
please forgive me as i develop and serve be patient god is 
not finished with me yet 
jackson used that speech to deliver his endorsement of the 1984 
democratic presidential nominee walter mondale but at the same 
time proclaimed that his own crusade the rainbow coalition 
would continue

the leftist government of nicaragua has no right 
to claim almost 900000 held in the united states for a nicaraguan 
steel company that was confiscated by the government a federal 
appeals court ruled tuesday 
the us court of appeals for the second circuit said the money 
should be distributed to the companys original shareholders 
principally a family that fled nicaragua in 1979 when the 
sandinistas were overthrowing the somoza government 
the court rejected nicaraguas contention that the disputed 
money should be turned over to the present government there 
the unanimous decision by the threejudge panel was written by 
judge irving r kaufman who emphasized that nicaragua had seized 
the company without compensating the original owners 
nicaragua is considering whether to appeal to the us supreme 
court said michael krinsky a lawyer representing the nicaraguan 
governments representatives here 
in the ruling kaufman noted that industria nacional de clavos y 
alambres de puas which produced and distributed steel products 
was founded by salvador bandes the bandes family along with 
numerous other associates of the tottering somoza regime fled 
the country in june 1979 the ruling said 
shortly thereafter the new sandinista government took over the 
company the bandes family sought a refund of 420000 that the 
steel concern had paid to a connecticut company for a shipment that 
was never completed 
harlow amp jones inc the us company agreed to send the refund 
to the bandes family but the nicaraguan government intervened on 
the grounds that it now operated the company and should get the 
refund instead 
with interest the disputed amount now totals nearly 900000 
tuesdays decision affirmed a ruling early this year by us 
district judge richard owen that the money should be distributed to 
the shareholders who owned the company before it was confiscated 
two former generals of the somoza regime are among the other 
shareholders 
kaufman said the act of state doctrine which usually bars 
us courts from questioning the validity of acts carried out by a 
foreign government in its own territory does not apply to property 
held in the united states

the reagan administration is expressing 
support for united nations efforts to nail down a ceasefire in the 
iraniraq war and backing away from its call for an international 
arms embargo on iran 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley on tuesday said that 
if un secretary general javier perez de cuellar succeeds in using 
diplomacy to achieve the ceasefire there wouldnt be need for a 
second followup resolution calling for the arms embargo 
the soviet union joined with the united states in approving a 
resolution last july for a ceasefire but refused to put force 
behind it with an arms embargo instead the soviets said they 
favored more diplomacy particularly through perez de cuellars 
office in new york 
mrs oakley declined to credit moscow with choosing the more 
effective course saying us pressure had contributed to irans 
decision to finally accept the ceasefire order 
i think you have to look at the first steps that are being 
taken as a testament to the success of a firm and consistent 
policy she said 
the state department official said its other accomplishments 
included protecting freedom of navigation and preventing the spread 
of soviet influence in the gulf region 
however the center for defense information a private research 
group said that while attacks on merchant shipping had declined a 
bit since december the toll since reagan ordered the us navy to 
protect neutral shipping last july had increased 
since july 22 of last year when 11 kuwaiti tankers were 
reflagged with the stars and stripes 188 merchant ships have been 
attacked 106 by iran and 82 by iraq a total of 320 merchant 
seamen were killed 
a year earlier there were 117 attacks 54 by iran and 63 by 
iraq the centers brian mccarten said 
while perez de cuellar moved to try to implement the ceasefire 
iran on tuesday claimed iraqi forces had attacked a nuclear plant 
and other iranian targets iranian warplanes retaliated by raiding 
a dam in iraq 
the reagan administration meanwhile hesitated to reduce the 
potent flotilla of 18 us warships that keep an eye on the 77 
million barrels a day of oil that pass through the strait of hormuz 
pentagon spokesman dan howard said it was too early to 
speculate when a ceasefire in the eightyear war might permit 
a reduction of us warships 
when all provisions of the united nations ceasefire resolution 
are implemented howard said the united states and its allies 
would no doubt reassess their expanded naval presence in the gulf 
but it is early days yet and premature to speculate on when 
where how or any kind of timetable we will have to wait and see 
on capitol hill meanwhile house armed services committee 
chairman les aspin dwis said irans embrace of the ceasefire 
plan should be treated cautiously 
our reaction should not be ecstasy that peace is at hand nor 
dismissal that the iranians are lying aspin said in a prepared 
statement 
he said there are two possible reasons for the announcement a 
genuine change by iran or a mere ploy to buy time to better 
prepare militarily

police sealed all entrances to the democratic 
national convention shortly before the longawaited speech by jesse 
jackson on tuesday night blaming overcrowding in the arena 
tempers flared as a crowd of about 1000 delegates guests and 
reporters pressed against police lines trying in vain to enter the 
omni 
this is unbelievable said stanley watkins a jackson 
delegate from chicago and an atlarge member of the democratic 
national committee they should have known this was going to 
happen i think they should have had it in a bigger hall 
among those in the crowd outside the arena was sen sam nunn of 
georgia who had addressed the convention a short time earlier 
asked whether he was upset at apparently being excluded from the 
hall he replied i wont comment but aides said later nunn 
had intended all along to return to his hotel after his speech 
at first police ordered everyone outside the convention hall to 
head across the street to the world congress center where the 
proceedings were being televised on a large screen in an auditorium 
no one moved 
about a halfhour later the hall was opened briefly and about 
35 delegates were allowed in but other delegates were still 
waiting outside when the hall was closed again 
the omni is a basketball arena normally seating 16237 people 
but that capacity was cut to about 11000 when the hall was 
remodeled to accommodate the convention 
a city ordinance says people can be prevented from entering a 
building once it has reached standing room only said benjamin 
sims a spokesman for the atlanta department of public safety 
more than 5300 delegates and alternates were to attend the 
convention other seats in the hall were filled by guests and 
reporters 
the guests and reporters were much on the mind of richard koster 
of panama cochairman of the tiny delegation representing 
democrats abroad who was among those stuck outside the hall 
you guys we need but youre not crucial koster said to a 
reporter fat cats are great but theyre not crucial 
many delegates were sent from gate to gate each time being told 
they could get in through the next gate some formed a human log 
jam in front of the police line others elbowed their way through 
the crowd yelling delegate delegate as they made their way 
toward the police line there were shouts of let me in and 
this is america buddy 
marie jackson held a guest pass from the louisiana delegation 
and waved it in the air i think this is ridiculous we dont 
want these things for souvenirs she said if i dont get to 
hear jesse its going to turn me off from this election 
its really a heartbreak when you drive 487 miles and you 
cant get in said huiet joseph her grandson who had a 
messenger pass from the louisiana delegation 
by the time jacksons speech was under way the crowd had 
dwindled to a few hundred 
jim mcdonald of the convention security staff said access to the 
omni was halted at 10 pm when officials with the atlanta fire 
department determined it was filled beyond safe capacity 
it was overcrowded mcdonald said im not going to get 
into numbers but its already over the number they originally gave 
us its enough

a former federal employee who was fired after 
he warned that major government buildings had deteriorated into 
hazardous condition has been ordered reinstated with back pay and 
legal fees 
the merit systems protection board ordered that bertrand g 
berube who lost his job five years ago be returned to his post at 
the general services administration the governments housekeeping 
agency 
im really pleased at the way it came out berube said 
tuesday i feel fully vindicated after five years im all 
ready to go back to work 
the award of back pay and legal fees could total as much as 
750000 
if indeed it goes into effect it will be the largest award of 
this type in the history of the civil service said louis clark 
one of berubes attorneys and director of the government 
accountability project a nonprofit group that seeks to assist 
whistleblowers 
clark said he hopes the berube case will have broad 
implications i hope it sends a signal to agencies that the merit 
systems protection board is not going to rubber stamp their 
terminations of people like bert berube he said 
he added that in view of the large amount of publicity generated 
by the berube case i believe this result will encourage other 
whistleblowers to fight on against their agency despite the 
immense odds they may face 
at the time of his firing in 1983 berube was regional 
administrator of the gsas national capital region overseeing 
7000 people and a budget of 2 billion he was in charge of 
maintaining virtually every government building in washington from 
the white house to the pentagon 
thengsa administrator gerald p carmen dismissed berube after 
he alleged that many federal buildings in washington posed serious 
fire and health hazards berube said gsa officials were routinely 
deferring needed building repairs so they could claim budget 
savings 
the boards ruling calling for berubes reinstatement can be 
appealed to the courts

jessica hahn should return the 150000 
trust fund she received from the ptl ministry in exchange for her 
silence over her sexual encounter with former ptl president jim 
bakker a federal bankruptcy judge ruled tuesday 
us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds entered the judgment 
tuesday against ms hahn and a los angeles lawyer who administered 
the trust fund scott furstman 
ptl had sued the two in april claiming that ms hahn broke her 
agreement with ptl by talking about her december 1980 meeting with 
bakker at a hotel in clearwater beach fla 
last year after the ptl scandal broke and bakker resigned ms 
hahn sold her story illustrated with seminude photos to 
playboy magazine for a reported 1 million 
ms hahn who recently moved out of the playboy mansion in los 
angeles and now lives in a hotel there never replied to the suit 
she and paul roper her representative in the 1985 transaction 
have said they did not realize the money was ptls rather than 
bakkers personal money 
furstman a lawyer ptl hired in 1985 to help in dealings with 
ms hahn had responded that he would not contest ptls claim 
under the judges order ptl will receive 160000 including 
principal and accrued interest from a 150000 trust fund it set 
up for ms hahn in february 1985 furstman will return 39000 of a 
retainer ptl paid him to administer the trust fund 
after bakker resigned in march 1987 it was revealed that bakker 
and his wife tammy had received millions of dollars in salaries 
and bonuses from ptl the tv ministry foundered as donations 
dwindled and ptl filed last year for bankruptcy reorganization 
with 130 million in debts 
the hahn transaction as well as other of bakkers financial 
dealings at ptl also are the object of a federal grand jury 
investigation in charlotte into possible tax fraud 
an irs report filed in bankruptcy court last december said ptls 
payments related to the hahn incident included the 150000 trust 
fund a 115000 payment given to roper who gave 20000 to ms 
hahn 85000 in legal fees to furstman and 10000 paid to ms 
hahn in 1984 for her signature on a statement absolving bakker of 
wrongdoing 
under the agreement with ms hahn she was to receive monthly 
interest from the trust fund for 20 years after which time she 
would receive the 150000 principal 
she did receive interest payments from may 1985 until ptl 
stopped the payments in march 1987 her tax returns indicate she 
received 10000 in 1985 she doesnt have to repay that money

the cia departed from its usual practice of 
staying mum on who it employs to dispute a report that vice 
president george bush was a cia operative in the early 1960s 
cia spokeswoman sharron basso said tuesday that a george william 
bush who worked the night shift at cia headquarters during that 
period apparently was the mr george bush referred to in a 
recently discovered fbi memorandum 
the nation magazine in its july 16 issue had suggested that 
the vice president who was appointed cia director in 1975 by 
president ford may have been the person referred to in the 1963 
memo by thenfbi director j edgar hoover 
in that memo to the state department hoover voiced the fbis 
concerns that anticastro groups in miami might use the 
assassination of president kennedy as the rationale for undertaking 
an unauthorized raid against cuba 
the substance of the foregoing information was orally 
furnished to mr george bush of the central intelligence agency 
the hoover memo stated 
the magazine article speculated that the vice president used his 
texas oil business as a cover for clandestine cia activities in the 
early 1960s the vice president denied the report 
ms basso said that while the agency usually does not confirm or 
deny employment or association with the cia in this case we 
believe the record should be clarified 
previously the cia would not comment on the article or on the 
possibility that bush may have worked for the agency more than a 
decade before he became its director 
ms basso said the other george bush not the george herbert 
walker bush who is vice president worked on the night watch at 
cia headquarters 
this would have been the appropriate place to have received 
such an fbi report this was apparently the george bush referred to 
in the nation article she said 
george william bush left the cia in 1964 to work for the defense 
intelligence agency which he has since left 
his current whereabouts are unknown the cia official said

for leonard tate a twotime jesse jackson 
delegate who paraded about the convention floor with his 
candidates photo placard and cap the moment he awaited so long 
for took him by surprise 
he expected fire from jackson he saw warmth he expected anger 
he heard peace 
and when jackson finished his tuesday night address to the 
democratic national convention tate said he learned something new 
he taught me a lesson i hadnt gotten over my bitterness 
over the vice presidential selection and i was going to write in 
jesses name in november tate said he showed us youve got to 
rise above pettiness and revenge and keep your eye on the prize 
the speech jackson delegates had so eagerly awaited turned into 
an emotional sunday sermon for many of them it began with a flurry 
of confetti and ended with a few tears there were the usual 
outbursts that turned the omni into a signwaving swirl of red but 
also some personal moments 
it had a lot of heart a lot of emotion said bill gibson of 
greenville sc a delegate and hometown friend of jackson as a 
civil rights activist myself i see this as a beginning 
jackson retraced the history of the civil rights movement 
repeated some regular campaign themes talked about his own 
background and aspirations and urged his supporters to join with 
the majority dukakis delegates 
the only time we win is when we come together he said 
although there was no specific endorsement of the massachusetts 
governor whose supporters had been instructed to keep their signs 
down and let the jackson followers have center stage the jackson 
delegates said they got the message 
he kept it upbeat and i think most of the delegates at this 
point are ready to pull together they have got the word from 
jesse said supporter marva smalls from south carolina 
it was very moving i had to hold back the tears at the end 
she said 
the man is on target nobody can do it better said state 
rep al edwards of texas 
ray moore a paper mill worker from green bay wis who has 
been on strike for 14 months had tears in his eyes most of the 
speech and chanted keep the hope alive during the pauses 
moore said jacksons message to his supporters was to keep 
working as hard as ever for dukakis election in november 
theres no choice weve got to moore said this is the 
only ship we have and we have to sail that ship 
and for those who hadnt been followers of jackson the speech 
brought a new understanding to the question what does jesse 
want 
jesse jackson explained to everybody why he runs said tom 
cain a white dukakis delegate from atlanta 
he runs because of what he once was not in a negative way but 
in a positive way he wants to be at the table of decisions and 
power for himself and for others he said 
sen paul sarbanes dmd called jacksons speech a 
tremendous appeal for unity 
and monique davis a black member of the illinois legislature 
from chicago and jackson delegate said she had seen jackson mature 
jesse recognizes that america has not learned yet the value of 
making a quilt he let us know that until we do that well 
continue to have foreclosed farms and a working underclass he 
turned the country inside out and it saw the ugly insides of its 
stomach she said 
im so proud of him ive seen him grow without bitterness 
into a statesman that america should be proud of

george bushs unusual attempt to grab headlines 
during michael dukakis convention is making democrats grumble and 
sparking a debate about whether it will pay off for the republican 
candidate 
ignoring the tradition that you dont campaign while your rival 
is crowned as his partys nominee vice president bush sets out 
today on an eightstate campaign tour through the midwest the 
south and southwest 
the strategy is not to let dukakis have a free ride during the 
democratic national convention and to curb the surge in popularity 
ratings he is likely to get from the intense publicity generated 
here 
republican strategists say dukakis modestly ahead in most 
polls could get a 5 to 10point jump from the convention 
bushs trek is timed to give him media exposure during the two 
biggest events of the convention tonight when dukakis is 
nominated and on thursday when texas sen lloyd bentsen is 
nominated and dukakis gives his acceptance speech 
it will have some positive impact said doug bailey a 
washingtonbased political consultant it means the national tv 
nightly news will not be 100 percent totally dominated by the 
democratic convention and dukakis thats significant 
david keene another washingtonarea political consultant who 
once worked for bush said he obviously wont dominate the news 
he can get some visibility certainly regionally wherever he is 
campaigning 
keene said bush may have some impact on dukakis poll ratings 
it might hold it a little bit but only marginally because a 
convention is the focal point of public attention the candidate 
unless the convention is a disaster usually gets a boost usually 
a shortterm boost 
democrats scoffed at bushs tactics 
his doing that suggests a sense of desperation and concern 
that im surprised by said charles manatt former democratic 
national chairman however manatt was quick to add that hed 
break that rule and custom raises questions of whether dukakis 
should do the same 
walter mondale the unsuccessful democratic presidential 
candidate four years ago said bushs ploy was a sign of weakness 
i dont think he solves that by just campaigning mondale 
said frenzy is not the same as an answer and he will have to 
deal with that 
norman ornstein a political scientist at the american 
enterprise institute called bushs plan very unusual and 
probably a little foolish he said bush might dilute dukakis 
message but that his campaigning will be looked on rather 
cynically by most voters 
even senate minority leader bob dole rkan was skeptical 
about bushs plan 
all the medias here dole told an atlanta news conference 
so nobodys going to know where he is anyway so it probably 
wont make any difference 
dole and rep lynn martin rill were the advance guard of 
another republican effort to divert the spotlight from dukakis on 
each day of the convention gop leaders are making themselves 
available to offer a contrasting view to the democrats 
rep martin said she did not think bush was playing dirty pool 
the politics is changing how you do it she said this 
isnt how you ran 12 years ago youre going to see all of them 
out a lot of the time and i dont believe that is raining on 
their parade 
explaining bushs strategy campaign manager lee atwater said 
we were roundly criticized for him not being out campaigning on 
monday and tuesday and then weve been criticized for having him 
out campaigning during the final days of the convention 
theres not a single move you can make during a campaign like 
that when you arent criticized by someone so we just decided to 
go ahead and let the vice president run his own campaign and let 
the chips fall where they may atwater said 
bush dropped out of sight saturday on a fishing trip in wyoming 
with james a baker iii his longtime friend who is expected to 
resign as treasury secretary next month to run the bush campaign 
tonight bush will make two appearances in the detroit area on 
thursday bush heads for the south with events in charlotte nc 
and greenville sc 
within the region whatever the locality is he will get a lot 
of attention so there really is no reason not to do it said 
consultant bailey 
on friday as dukakis and bentsen leave the convention in 
triumph bush will be on the road again campaigning in wisconsin 
and new jersey followed the next day by stops in tennessee and 
florida and on sunday in new mexico

the city that says its too busy to hate 
hates to think people wont like it this week 
as atlanta prepared to host the democratic national convention 
residents and civic leaders worried about everything from courteous 
cabbies to crime to cleanliness they put up a new park posted 
police on conventionarea corners and even sent cabbies to charm 
school 
now at the midpoint of the convention theres even concern 
over too much concern 
we sure will be glad when its over downtown hotel worker 
michael johnson said tuesday as he waited to catch a subway train 
michael lomax chairman of the fulton county commission 
suggested to residents in a newspaper column that obsessive 
boosterism was damaging and they just lighten up and enjoy the 
show 
if theres a tendency to savage atlanta in print we certainly 
contribute to it by being selfconscious about our appearance so 
preoccupied with making things pictureperfect lomax said 
the atlanta constitution has been publishing excerpts of other 
newspapers comments on the city downtown atlanta is a 
dreadful place the new york daily news cocky and gawky 
wallowing in selflove and selfdoubt the chicago tribune 
but at the subway stops and on the street corners residents 
recite the refrain that its worth it to put up late buses 
gridlock traffic and even bad reviews because the attention 
garnered during the fourday affair will boost the city 
i think its great said robert alpert a downtown 
chiropractor the city did a lot of quick repair before the 
convention got here and its paying off 
still they worry that something will go wrong while the 
democrats are in town something that could smudge the carefully 
crafted image atlanta is trying to project with all the primping 
and prepping 
it brought more money to atlanta more people are employed 
now even if it is just for a week said patricia rush whos 
picked up a parttime security job at the convention site its 
been good and i think everything will work out all right 
like so many ms rush is happy to have the convention here and 
a little sad too 
its been nothing but hectic this week the bus service is 
slow because all the buses are taking delegates around theyve 
blocked off some streets and its just a mess she said 
johnson too is picking up extra money working long hours at 
the ritzcarlton hotel 
in a sense it has brought a smile to the city and also 
frowns said johnson when you disturb ones bed you dont 
rest 
and as far as the extra money hes making im too tired to 
enjoy it

president lee tenghui announced a major 
cabinet reshuffle today promoting younger officials and native 
taiwanese less than two weeks after he was acclaimed chairman of 
the ruling nationalist party 
lee brought eight new officials into the 25member cabinet and 
transferred seven members to new posts he kept premier yu kuohwa 
the governments leading conservative 
the nationalist party said in a press release that its 
policymaking central standing committee approved the appointments 
today officials said the new appointees would take office monday 
a major cabinet overhaul was expected after the 13th congress of 
the nationalist party ended last week party personnel changes 
showed power shifting from conservatives of the chiang kaishek era 
to a younger generation largely comprised of native taiwanese 
the nationalists led by chiang set up their authoritarian 
government in taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to communist 
forces on the chinese mainland 
lee a 65yearold native taiwanese promised to continue 
democratic reform and other liberalization begun in recent years by 
his predecessor chiang chingkuo the eldest son of chiang 
kaishek chiang chingkuo died in january of heart failure 
the new cabinet indicates lee will continue to move gradually 
native taiwanese hold 11 seats in the new cabinet including the 
important posts of foreign minister and finance minister which 
always have been held by mainland chinese 
this represents an increase of three seats held by native 
taiwanese who comprise 85 percent of taiwans population of nearly 
20 million 
many new cabinet members are viewed as technocrats including 
several groomed by yu and other party conservatives but observers 
believe the new lineup should speed up liberalization of the 
statedominated economic system 
premier yu has been under tremendous pressure to reform 
said lin anlo chief economist at the chunghwa institute for 
economic research we hope he can do better with the cooperation 
of the younger cabinet members 
lee has led calls for reform of the economic and financial 
system but economists say the nationalist government has moved 
slowly to avoid irritating powerful vested interests 
the nationalist party controls taiwans banks and many other 
large enterprises conservative party members generally oppose the 
privatization of banks and other businesses and the reform of 
taxation steps that many people say are necessary to bring the 
island into the modern global economy 
vice premier lien chan 52 will be the new foreign minister 
frederick chien 54 taiwans representative to washington will 
replace 73yearold chao yaotung as head of the council for 
economic planning and development the announcement did not name a 
new representative in washington chen lian 51 chairman of the 
national science council will replace 69yearold lee tahai as 
economic affairs minister 
both lee and chao would retire 
shirley kuo 58 deputy governor of the central bank will head 
the finance ministry replacing robert chien 59 named the 
cabinets secretary general 
the youngest cabinet member will be ma yingjeou 38 a party 
deputy secretary general appointed to head the research 
development and evaluation commission 
lee also named a scientist an agricultural expert and an 
education administrator to replace three aging officials as 
ministers without portfolio 
yu formally proposed the new cabinet and lee submitted it to 
the party central standing committee after discussions with yu

for republicans getting a message out can be 
trying in a town thats geared this week for democrats or at least 
a little tacky around the edges 
did you just save us a worried barrie tron asked a 
repairman urgently trying to restore electricity to the 
republican media center 
he had and another days truth squad session came off as 
scheduled though hardly in the lap of luxury 
when the national republican congressional committee decided to 
trot in top republicans every day to counter the overwhelming focus 
being given to this weeks democratic national convention they 
quickly learned how much space is at a premium in a town thats 
jammed with 35000 extra people 
the daily republican sessions are at a downtown hotel in a room 
thats yet to be finished 
its the most finished of the unfinished rooms said tron a 
gop committee staffer in this case finished means air 
conditioned 
so each day the assembled press corps and the days cast of 
republican luminaries troop into a small room where exposed pipes 
dominate the higher reaches blue curtains have been hung to 
partially cover bare concrete walls and windows that have paper 
taped over them 
when the power failed tuesday plunging the room into 
semidarkness tron was philosophical were mood lighting this 
one he said as he called for help 
its the first time ive ever seen a boiler room operation in 
a boiler room said one of the participants 
still tron said theres room for everybody and the blue 
curtains make a nice backdrop for the television cameras showing up 
every day 
actually its a pretty good room he said 
the daily gop gathering is hardly the top news of the day but 
its attracting increased attention particularly as disputes among 
the democrats are resolved 
mondays meeting prompted mike mccurry a spokesman for the 
democratic national committee to compare the gop gathering to ants 
which inevitably show up at a picnic 
rich galen a gop spokesman quickly got into the swing of 
things by firing off a letter to mccurry accompanied by a 
miniature ant farm 
i know when you referred to us as ants you were complimenting 
us on our industriousness galen wrote the ant farm was he 
said a token of our appreciation 
the republicans also just happened to land in the hotel where 
jesse jackson is staying and that has provided a few interesting 
moments 
during mondays session thousands of jackson backers chanted 
run jesse run as former white house political strategist ed 
rollins discussed the impact of the unity agreement between jackson 
and michael dukakis the certain democratic nominee 
were just here to give you folks the contrast you need 
said new hampshire gov john sununu one of the designated critics 
on tuesday we are here to provide an opportunity for comparison 
shopping 
its not an effort to be negative its an effort to be 
comparative galen said 
galen dismissed suggestions that republicans were trying to rain 
on the democrats parade and said he assumed they will dispatch a 
similar force to next months republican national convention in new 
orleans

more than half the satellite trucks in america 
are here for the democratic convention beaming nearly nonstop to 
places like japan and white river junction vt from their parking 
spots next to a highway embankment 
the people who run them are figurative light years away from the 
rhetoric klieg lights and air conditioning of the convention 
they dont have a bathroom either 
were on the other side of the tracks said emeric feldman 
an engineer for wcvb in boston therere 40 trucks and 100 guys 
out here and we cant get a portojohn theres no water no 
food 
he joked weve threatened to boycott shut the whole thing 
down 
the 43 trucks lined up on a desolate street at the raw rear 
entrance of the georgia world congress center make up the largest 
collection of dishes ever assembled in one place a dozen more are 
parked elsewhere in the city 
their presence is a boon for the democrats providing exposure 
far beyond the couple of hours of convention coverage shown nightly 
on the networks 
the trucks and dishes enable local stations to showcase their 
own people and generate as much material as their audience will 
bear the party has thoughtfully provided standup space for local 
reporters inside the omni convention hall 
there were only a few satellite trucks at the 1984 conventions 
they all laughed feldman recalled they said it would never 
work 
the satellite park just a few blocks away from the convention 
glitz at once awesome and grim proves the skeptics definitively 
wrong 
its three blocklong rows of hightech dish trucks spacelink 
and skylink newstar and livestar a couple of uhauls and budget 
rentatrucks are spectacular in their number if not their 
setting 
weve got the sewers on one side and the dumpsters on the 
other said daryl hunter an engineer sent by gte spacelink corp 
to check and repair equipment at this convention within a 
convention 
along with their space and sky references the trucks announce 
their origins new york and boston milwaukee and winstonsalem 
kansas city and little rock washington and tampa springfield and 
new orleans south bend and scranton and no kidding white river 
junction vt 
were still kind of astonished to be here said keith 
bergstrom director of satellite operations for wnne in white river 
junction were a very small station we operate out of the 
basement of a motel 
feldman of wcvb in boston said his station sent 19 people and 
by network standards is saturating viewers with convention news 
a halfhour at noon live updates throughout the afternoon 90 
minutes at 730 pm in addition to heavy coverage on the 6 pm 
and 11 pm local newscasts the dish is shared with other stations 
including one in japan he said 
with home viewers the key to this years convention described 
by the party chairman as a fourpart miniseries with a live studio 
audience you might expect royal treatment for the dish operators 
but their most elegant amenity so far is an occasional visit by a 
canteen truck 
the work is hot especially when a dish goes awry and must be 
fiddled with atop the truck ive gone through all my changes of 
clothing i change twice a day and take showers three times a 
day said hunter 
i dont have time to go take showers last week i worked 96 
hours and this week itll probably be more said feldman but

touched deep chords of memory and hope in democrats and americans

president who asks each of us what we can do for our country 
for a long time i have believed that what this country needs is 
another president from massachusetts and now its going to happen 
president dukakis it has a nice ring doesnt it 
some people say dont count your chickens before theyre 
hatched well the republicans have already hatched their chicken 
in this campaign and george bush is a dead duck 
and that doesnt even count all the other chickens theyve 
hatched in the past eight years that are coming home to roost on 
election day this november 
we know who and what we are running against we know them by 
their names and by their deeds they are the party of ed meese and 
robert bork they are the party of irangate contragate 
pentagongate they are the party that tolerates apartheid abroad 
and retreats from civil rights here at home 
they are the party that talks tough on drugs but deals softly 
with drugrunning dictators we have heard the slogan just say 
no the problem is our republican opponents just couldnt say 
no to general noriega

as democrats we know who we are and where we stand and what 
we seek 
we are the diversity of america committed to the ideal that all 
of us can advance together and none shall be left behind 
we are the party of change and across the generations we have 
seen what our country can become 
we have never been willing to stand on the sidelines of history 
whether the issue was war or peace equality or justice we have 
been at the center of the struggle and sometimes we have known 
our setbacks and paid a political price we lost some elections 
but we never lost our soul and now we know that the struggle has 
made us stronger as this country is ready to move again and we 
are ready to lead 
we are strengthened by a vigorous and honorable primary 
campaign we are strengthened by an extraordinary group of 
candidates who this spring made all of us proud to be democrats 
we are strengthened by the example and the eloquence of one of 
the most talented individuals in this nation one whose life and 
words alike give new meaning to our oldest ideals he stands for 
freedom and compassion and his effort makes all of us prouder than 
ever to be americans the rev jesse jackson 
most of all we are strengthened because we will enter this 
campaign as the party of hope the party of both competence and 
concern the party of mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen 
i know mike dukakis i know his decency and his talent i know 
his spirit he cares about making government work because he cares 
deeply about people i have seen the presidency up close and i 
have seldom seen anyone as matched to the demands and possibilities 
of that office as mike dukakis 
yes i know mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen as friends and i 
admire them as leaders i have faith in them faith in jesse 
jackson we have a job to do together and if all of us are 
together we shall not fail 
there is a continuity between the dukakisbentsen ticket of 1988 
and the kennedyjohnson ticket of 1960 it is a continuity of 
commitment and not just geography for mike dukakis and lloyd 
bentsen like john kennedy and lyndon johnson believe that we 
cannot be content with things as they are that there is a newer 
frontier to be crossed and a greater society to be built 
after eight years of complacency and indifference of problems 
untended and pains untreated it is time to restore purpose and 
principle to america

says investing in america and reducing the deficit requires that 
the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share and that we 
restrain pentagon spending

more stable defense budgets says the democrats espouse a 
clearheaded toughminded decisive american foreign policy 
education talks about significantly increasing federal 
funding for education declares that the education of our 
citizens from head start to institutions of higher learning

social security promises the system will be safeguarded

trade promises to seek to export more american goods and 
fewer american jobs 
corporations vows to halt such irresponsible corporate 
conduct as unproductive takeovers monopolistic mergers insider 
training and golden parachutes for executives by reinvigorating 
our antitrust and securities laws 
drugs calls for a national drug czar to halt both the 
international supply and the domestic demand for illegal drugs 
would strengthen enforcement and education efforts 
crime backs a ban on cop killer bullets 
women supports an equal rights amendment and the

from atlanta to seattle from houston to boston everywhere in 
our land there are men and women willing to work who deserve a 
chance to work there are children to be taught families to be 
housed farms to be saved diseases to be cured hungry to be fed 
homeless to be cared for and justice to be done 
and in the larger world from the persian gulf to central 
america from the soviet union to south africa there are wars to 
be halted arms to be reduced families to be united human rights 
to be defended and apartheid to be ended 
president reagan deserves credit for the moscow summit but i 
wish that just once this president would speak as forcefully for 
civil rights in the united states as he does for human rights in 
the soviet union 
but at least ronald reagan accepts the blame as well as the 
credit for the policies of the past eight years he comes without 
excuses and equivocation he stands up looks us in the eye but 
not george bush who on question after question keeps burying his 
head in his hands and hiding from the record of the reaganbush 
mistakes 
the vice president says he wasnt there or cant recall or 
never heard as the administration secretly plotted to sell arms 
to iran so when that monumental mistake was being made i think it 
is fair to ask where was george 
the vice president says he never saw or cant remember or 
did not comprehend the intelligence report on general noriegas 
involvement in the cocaine cartel so when that report was being 
prepared and discussed i think its fair to ask where was george 
the vice president claims he cares about the elderly but 
evidently he didnt know or wasnt there when the administration 
tried repeatedly to slash social security and medicare so when 
those decisions were being made i think its fair to ask where 
was george 
and the vice president who now speaks fervently of civil 
rights apparently wasnt around or didnt quite hear when the 
administration was planning to weaken voting rights give tax 
breaks to segregated schools and veto the civil rights restoration 
act so when all those assaults were being mounted i think its 
fair to ask where was george 
in fact the vice president even we all know we all know the 
answer to all these questions george bush is the man who is never 
there and he wont be there after the clock strikes noon on 
january 2oth 1989

his only major economic proposal is a wonderfully republican 
idea to cut the capital gains tax for the rich that may be good 
for his friends who clip coupons but the hardworking taxpayers 
of this country cannot afford to be clipped again by another round 
of voodoo economics 
i wonder who coined that phrase 
america needs more shelters for the homeless not more tax 
shelters for the privileged 
america needs more affordable housing for the middle class not 
more tax breaks for the upper class 
america needs to bring the disabled into the mainstream and not 
relegate whole groups of our people to the backwaters of our 
economy 
the next administration must do more than provide comfort for 
the comfortable and the next president must offer more than a pale 
imitation of a reaganism whose time has faded 
a new century is dawning the old order is changing we must 
look beyond the next election to the horizon of the next 
generation and there is no one better matched to the challenge 
than mike dukakis he saw the future coming in massachusetts he 
led the transition from a faltering 1950s economy to a modern 
economy at the cutting edge of change mike dukakis is the man who 
did it for massachusetts and mike dukakis is the man who is going 
to do it for the united states of america 
george bush may want to lower the capital gains tax but mike 
dukakis will repeal the corruption tax we are all paying in the 
form of defense cost overruns and a pentagon bribery scandal 
that has bloated the budget by billions of dollars so lets not 
raise taxes on averageincome families lets lower the boom on 
high level corruption 
the years ahead can be a bad time or the best of times the 
problem today is not americas people but americas leadership

our people know the difference between right and wrong we all 
see the faces pressed against the windows of our affluence and we 
wonder now whether our children will be consigned to a lesser life 
in a lesser land 
we cannot be satisfied to see american students rank l5th among 
the industrial nations in science and math 
we must strengthen education not attack it 
we must abolish illiteracy not abide it 
we must invest in star schools here on earth not star wars in 
the heavens 
and we must heed the message of jesse jackson we must banish 
drugs from our classrooms from our playgrounds from the streets 
of our cities and from everywhere in our nation 
we must make america once again the best educated society in the 
world we must see to it that in the 1990s young americans wont 
just go to school they will learn in school 
at the same time we must respond to the human realities of a 
day as distant from the new deal as that era was from the age of 
the horse and buggy today when more than 50 percent of mothers 
work including half of those with children under the age of one 
it is a national disgrace that we have failed to secure basic child 
care for working parents no mother who wants to work or has to 
work should have to fear for the health or safety of her child 
when she is on the job 
nor shall we ever consent to the permanent division of our 
nation into three societies one doing well a second barely 
holding on the third trapped decade after decade in hopelessness 
anger and violence 
all this and more will be decided at the desk of the next 
president a world transformed takes many different forms there 
are dangers and other challenges but there is one of which i 
finally speak and which must be one of the first priorities of 
the next administration 
all my public life i have fought my heart out for the principle 
that the state of a familys health should never be determined by 
the size of a familys wealth and i stand here this evening and 
tell you that at long last victory is within our grasp 
the first critical step has already been taken this year in 
massachusetts governor dukakis passed comprehensive 
costeffective access to medical care for every citizen of our 
state

and next year in washington president dukakis will wage and 
win the battle to secure decent health care for all the people of 
our nation 
i will be standing there with him in the forefront of that 
battle because america should not be the only industrial nation 
on earth except for south africa that insures the health of its 
politicians but not its people 
in closing in closing let me pledge every resource of mind and 
spirit that i have to the success of our cause in 1988 you and i 
have stood together many times but no time has been more 
important than this the campaign that stretches before us now is a 
struggle for the soul and the future of america 
for we are more than a political coalition more than a 
collection of programs more than the sum of our prospects and our 
strategies most of all we are the trustees of a dream 
twenty years ago in 1968 we lost two of the most powerful 
voices of that dream but they left us their vision their values 
and the hopes they awakened in the countless millions of people 
whose hearts they touched we remember them now to remind ourselves 
that the american journey is unfinished that we stand for change 
in order to march again towards enduring ideals that we do not 
have to settle for things as they are 
martin luther king jr told us something we need to hear anew 
he said we are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today 
we are confronted with the fierce urgency of now in the unfolding 
of life and history there is such a thing as being too late and 
dr king also said we must work unceasingly to lift this nation 
to a higher destiny to a new plateau of compassion 
and in that time there was another voice only briefly heard 
but whose words too have outlasted all the loss and years robert 
kennedy said each time a man stands up for an ideal or acts to 
improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice he 
sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a 
million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build 
a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and 
resistance 
he was my brother but he and dr king were also in the deepest 
sense brothers to us all 
these two these valiant two lived for the same dream and were 
gone only months apart and if they were here with us two decades 
later i think i know what they would say 
now is the time some men see things as they are and say why we 
dream things that never were and say why not now is the time

rosa parks whose refusal to give up her bus seat 
to a white man in 1955 helped launch the civil rights movement was 
given a place of honor during jesse jacksons speech to the 
democratic national convention 
jackson who escorted the former montgomery ala seamstress 
into the jampacked convention hall tuesday night called her the 
mother of the civil rights movement 
jackson introduced her at the beginning of his speech to the 
convention as she smiled and waved many in the crowd chanted 
rosa rosa rosa 
mrs parks now 75 was arrested when she refused to give up her 
seat to a white man on a segregated bus in montgomery which in 
1955 required blacks by law to sit in the back 
jackson called mrs parks an inspiration 
she struck the first blow for freedom said jackson she 
was a moral challenge to all of us 
with her arrest montgomery blacks launched a boycott of the bus 
system and a young local preacher the rev martin luther king 
jr soon became the boycotts leader 
the yearlong boycott brought king to national prominence and 
led to voting rights and equal rights struggles across alabama and 
the south 
jackson in his speech also invoked the memories of others who 
lost their lives during the years of racial upheaval 
he mentioned jimmy lee jackson an alabama black man and viola 
liuzo a white detroit housewife who were killed during the 1965 
voting rights effort in alabama and the four black girls killed in 
a birmingham church bombing during that period of ku klux klan 
violence

idealistic public servant who taught them to have hope and 
principles the youngest told democratic convention delegates that 
if i could vote id vote for my dad 
jesse jackson jr 23 introduced his father tuesday night as 
the next president of the united states

our dad jesse jackson 
the jackson children made brief remarks before delegates saw a 
videotape of the candidate and heard his 49minute speech

millionaires we create said santita jackson 24 who works on 
capitol hill in washington leadership like that comes in the 
form of my father 
yusef 17 entering the university of virginia this fall said 
many of his contemporaries have tried to spell relief drugs 
instead of love my father being the general in the war on 
drugs has offered us a way out hes given us inspiration and a 
new direction 
my father has given me what i think is the most valuable gift 
he has put confidence back in the belief that all things can be 
achieved said jonathan 22 a recent graduate of north carolina 
agricultural and technological university his fathers alma mater 
to many he is a hero to us he is also our father jesse 
jr said from him we have learned that when confronted with 
challenge and controversy we must stand up for the things that we 
believe in 
jacqueline 12 made a brief but eloquent pitch if i could 
vote id vote for my dad she said he has made a difference

michael dukakis will be campaigning on a 
democratic platform so brief that some voters might actually read 
it and so generalized that even if they do it probably wont hurt 
his ticket 
both are departures from the booklength platforms democrats had 
taken to writing in efforts to cater to every faction in their 
coalition that kind of platformmaking was futile at best and 
what they said was sometimes used against them 
they produced catalogues of promises which republican 
campaigners cited as evidence that the democrats were committed to 
spiraling spending and beholden to special interests 
it never did them much good nobody elects platforms which are 
widely ignored even by the candidates who theoretically run on 
them presidents jimmy carter in 1980 and gerald r ford in 1976 
both accepted platform planks they opposed rather than risk 
convention votes they might have lost 
the platform episodes were quickly forgotten so for that 
matter were the platforms 
ford lost to carter in the 1976 election and carter to 
president reagan in 1980 but not because of platforms or platform 
concessions 
the dukakis departure from the wordy promises of the recent 
democratic past actually was the handiwork of democratic national 
chairman paul kirk who urged long before the primary campaign that 
the 1988 platform be a broad statement of principles not a wish 
list for interest groups 
his plan was to avoid the kind of baggage lugged by past 
democratic tickets it succeeded the new platform is a 4500word 
statement of democratic tenets longer on rhetoric than on 
specifics it carries no price tag and defies any effort to compute 
one 
republicans are trying to paint dukakis in liberal colors but 
the democratic platform is no help gop campaign spokesmen said the 
democrats are just trying to cloak their liberal intentions 
it is the tax and spend wing that is in control said gov 
john sununu of new hampshire they have written a platform that 
attempts to hide that sen john warner of virginia said the 
voters have a right to know what is being concealed behind the 
vague generalities south carolina gov carroll campbell said the 
democrats were trying to shield dukakis from the liberal tag and 
pulling together to help perpetuate the fraud 
vice president george bush has argued that theme since it became 
clear that dukakis would be the democratic nominee 
but the democratic platform will supply scant ammunition 
michael barnes the former maryland congressman who worked on the 
platform for dukakis said nothing in the document would in any 
way commit the next congress or commit the next president even 
theoretically to any specific spending program 
nor does the platform seek tax increases on business and the 
wealthy as jesse jackson supporters wanted republicans never let 
walter f mondale forget his 1984 convention statement that if he 
were elected taxes would have to be increased they will argue 
that a dukakis administration means higher taxes but theyll have 
to make the case without a specific target this time 
democratic platforms had been growing wordier for 20 years they 
also had become increasingly explicit in their promises 
particularly on expensive domestic programs republicans won four 
of the five presidential elections during those years 
by 1984 the platform was a 45000 word compendium of 
compromises and commitments that played into the gop strategy of 
calling the democratic ticket a liberal captive of countless 
factions and interests 
in 1980 thenpresident carter had to capitulate and accept a 
set of platform planks advocated by sen edward m kennedy among 
them a commitment to a 12 billion public service jobs program 
challenger kennedy was short of the votes it would have taken to 
deny carter renomination but the president didnt want to risk 
convention defeat on the platform so he surrendered and then 
announced that he accepted only the intent not the specifics of 
the conventionapproved platform planks it was an overnight issue 
after that nobody noticed the discrepancy 
four years earlier the republican platform effectively 
renounced the foreign policy of the republican administration 
ronald reagan challenged ford for the nomination that year and 
came close ford strategists feared a platform confrontation might 
shake their grip on the nomination itself so they gave the reagan 
side its way on the foreign policy plank it made no difference 
thats the story of party platforms they dont really help 
candidates and they can arm opponents 
hence the democrats streamlined new look 
rep william gray of pennsylvania a jackson negotiator on the 
platform said the democrats 1988 handiwork is brief readable 
and understandable like the gettysburg address and the ten 
commandments 
any comparison ends there the political world will little note 
nor long remember its phrases and the platform includes few 
commandments the democrats were purposefully vague about what they 
shalt or shalt not do

delegates remembering the spirit of john f 
kennedy cheered wildly as the late presidents son made his 
political debut with a primetime speech before the democratic 
national convention 
so many of you came into public service because of him in a 
very real sense because of you he is still with us john f 
kennedy jr said tuesday night 
the handsome 27yearold law student still remembered by many 
as the 3yearold who stood by his mothers side and saluted his 
slain fathers casket in 1963 mounted the convention podium to 
introduce his uncle sen edward m kennedy dmass 
im not a political leader but i can speak for those of my 
age whove been inspired by teddy to give their energy and their 
ideas to their community and not just themselves kennedy said 
he has shown that our hope is not lost idealism but a realistic 
possibility 
the senator embraced his nephew and told the audience that john 
jr should remind us that we are at our best when we have a 
president who asks each of us what we can do for our country 
you have touched deep chords of memory and hope in democrats 
and americans everywhere the senator told john jr tonight 
you have given something special to this convention and this 
country 
the appearance by kennedy a thirdyear law student at new york 
university triggered speculation that he might be the next kennedy 
to entire politics during most of his life he has carefully 
avoided both publicity and politics 
house speaker jim wright who introduced young kennedy to the 
eager audience called him a young man whom we all clasped to our 
hearts and whom we will love today as we have in the past and whom 
we will come to love in the future 
kennedy received a thunderous standing ovation and his 
twominute speech was interrupted six times by applause

former house speaker thomas p oneill jr for 
years the leader and symbol of liberal democratic politics now 
says he and the party drifted too far to the left 
the massachusetts democrat known as tip on tuesday applauded 
efforts by michael dukakis and others to pull the party closer to 
the political center 
we really got too far off to the left to be perfectly 
truthful and i was one of those who were out there oneill said 
for years the old liberal wing of the party tried to control 
the party lock stock and barrel and because of that we lost an 
awful lot of people he said politics is the art of 
compromise you have to have a voice on both sides 
today oneill said the democratic party is much more 
diversified we have everybody from every element 
economicwise ethnicwise regionalwise and thats the way it 
was back in the 30s when we were developing america 
oneill 75 who retired in 1986 after 50 years in politics the 
last 34 in the house is here as a super delegate from 
massachusetts 
speaking informally to reporters at a massachusetts delegation 
breakfast sponsored by sen john f kerry dmass oneill said he 
is confident michael dukakis would win in november 
i have never at least in 28 years since jack kennedy seen 
the party as united as we are right now the former speaker said 
theres no question this ticket is going to bring us victory 
although he has been out of office for 1 years oneill remains 
the consummate politician stopping to chat at the convention with 
dozens of fans and have his photo taken with them treating each 
like a longlost friend with a genuine how are you dear 
some other convention insights from oneill 
on jesse jackson he knows hes made a place in history 
on platform fights you need these to stimulate the 
convention not only that they bring out the minority views that 
are expressed and the people should know about them 
on keynote speaker ann richards i dont think a man could 
get away with saying what she said to be perfectly truthful but 
she said it beautifully she was great absolutely fantastic

proud democrats say their nofrills platform 
offers a blueprint for a better america without serving as a 
storehouse of ammunition for republican rivals 
the convention shouted enthusiastic approval of the platform 
tuesday night after soundly rejecting jesse jacksons call for 
higher taxes on the wealthy and no us first use of nuclear 
weapons they also approved a raft of less controversial amendments 
agreed to by jackson and michael dukakis 
there also was a carefully staged debate on jacksons call for 
palestinian selfdetermination but by prior agreement the jackson 
forces withdrew that minority plank before a vote was taken 
an exultant michigan gov james j blanchard who chaired the 
platform committee said tonight the democratic party unites 
enduring values with new ideas to present a blueprint for a better 
america 
our platform offers challenges to put aside the selfishness 
scandal and stagnation of the past eight years and to rekindle once 
again the values and spirit of our great american family 
blanchard said 
rep robert matsui of california who helped write it said 
this platform is for our children this is a document for the 
future of america 
despite concessions there is nothing in the platform to give 
dukakis any concern said former rep michael barnes of maryland 
the prospective nominees chief platform negotiator the document 
is devoid of specific budget promises 
we wanted to maintain a platform on which he could very 
comfortably campaign and frankly which could help to unite the 
party and which democrats across the country could comfortably 
campaign on said barnes 
in the past many democratic candidates have complained that an 
ultraliberal party platform was an albatross around their necks at 
election time 
the dukakis delegates defeated by 2499 to 10915 jacksons 
fair tax plank which called for raising taxes on the wealthy 
and on corporations back to prereagan levels there were 90 
abstentions 
on the effort to rule out first use of nuclear weapons the 
jackson forces picked up a few more delegates including sen 
claiborne pell of rhode island chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee but that proposed plank also was rejected on 
the only other recorded vote 24741 to 12206 with 67 
abstentions 
as promised the palestinian plank never came to a vote but 
james zogby executive director of the arabamerican institute 
expressed satisfaction that the issue at least could be debated 
the deadly silence that submerged the issue of palestinian 
rights has been shattered he said we dont need votes 
as zogby spoke supporters paraded a 30foot banner reading 
selfdetermination and statehood for the palestinian people 
sen daniel inouye of hawaii called the jackson language on the 
middle east plank a vicious kick in the teeth of americas 
interests in that part of the world 
on jacksons tax plank denver mayor fredrico pena said i 
dont like throwing softballs to an opponent to knock out of the 
park and a tax hike pitch is a grand slam for george bush 
the platform ran barely 5000 words with the amendments 
titled the restoration of competence and the revival of 
hope it mentions neither ronald reagan or george bush but 
promises to reverse voodoo economics help the homeless and 
needy improve education and maintain more stable defense 
budgets 
the platform is barely oneeighth the length of the democrats 
1984 declaration of principles and the shortest since the terse 
platforms that franklin d roosevelt rode to victory in the 1930s

the rev billy graham cited jesse jackson and pat 
robertson as examples of how members of the clergy should and 
should not campaign for public office 
jacksons presidential candidacy has demonstrated that clergymen 
can seek public office and take strong moral stands without 
mingling religion with politics graham said tuesday 
on the other hand he said if pat robertson made a major 
mistake it was when he renounced his ordination i think even the 
people who followed him or people who didnt follow him would 
have a hard time understanding how a man could be called of god 
ordained of god and youre ordained for life and to renounce 
it

presidential nomination graham who says hes not taking sides

it went an hour beyond the end of prime time but 
there was no way the networks were going to cut away once the 
shows star jesse jackson took center stage on the second night 
of the democrats madefortv convention 
jackson didnt even get to the podium until 1055 but the 
networks stayed with him until well after his 50minute speech 
brought down the house prime time this time went well beyond its 
normal 11 pm edt closeoff 
jacksons stemwinder followed another enormously telegenic event 
the first major public appearance of john f kennedy jr who 
introduced a speech by his uncle sen edward kennedy the elder 
kennedys address would have been the evenings highlight itself if 
not for jacksons longawaited outpouring of emotion later in the 
evening 
abc had the foresight to have on hand those famous photos of 
johnjohn crawling under his fathers desk in the oval office 
and saluting as kennedys funeral procession departed the church 
nbcs connie chung grabbed an exclusive interview with young 
kennedy as he left the podium he said he had been nervous but 
that it felt pretty good standing up there 
as for uncle ted there seemed to be some split opinions among 
the network commentators as to his future with the democratic 
party cbs walter cronkite suggested that he should not be counted 
out of the running for a future nomination abcs sam donaldson had 
the opposite view 
i dont think hes ever going to be president because of you 
know what he told peter jennings in a reference to 
chappaquiddick 
despite the appearance by the kennedy clan the networks were 
just eaten up with anticipation over the impending appearance by 
jackson finally getting his big moment before the convention 
its michael dukakis convention but this is jesse jacksons 
night to shine said cbs dan rather who later touted jacksons 
appearance as something of a historical event 
if you want to gather the children around the television set 
or get grandmother from the other room its coming up in about 15 
to 20 minutes he offered helpfully 
better fasten your seatbelts nbcs tom brokaw warned as 
jackson arrived on the podium 
jacksons speech was delayed by a series of speeches on such 
weighty platform issues as national defense and taxation speeches 
the networks judged too boring for national television audiences 
abc carried an interview with george bushs campaign manager 
instead nbc continued discussing whether jackson would get into 
prime time viewers who wanted to see lesserknown speakers talk 
about the issues had to turn to cspan though cbs and cnn did 
carry a portion of the speech on the economy by rep william gray 
iii dpa 
during jacksons lengthy address nbc boasted some eloquent 
camera work doing slow dissolves of reaction shots the faces 
black white brown young old nbc also had a nice cutaway to 
jacksons guest on the podium rosa parks 
there was pandemonium after the speech as network floor 
reporters rushed to grab an interview abcs sam donaldson and cbs 
ed bradley were part of the crush of an impromptu news conference 
chung nbcs podium reporter could be seen struggling in the 
background out of microphone reach she finally nabbed jackson 
but shortly into their interview he started giving 
uncharacteristically curt answers chung seemed perplexed finally 
the reverend whispered over his shoulder right now theyre

television producers complained tuesday that the democratic 
party was literally leaving them in the dark at times during 
primetime convention hours by dimming the lights below previously 
agreedupon levels 
theyre dimming them much more than they said they would 
said pool producer charlie frey we get into the actual show 
itself and its like a las vegas production 
frey said light levels were set in advance but democratic 
national committee officials during speeches lowered the lights 
making it difficult for network cameras to get reaction shots of 
delegates he said 
its their convention and they can do what they want to do 
frey said they control the lights but we agreed on a level and 
theyre varying from it 
a dnc spokesman said officials familiar with the lighting 
arrangements were unavailable for comment

slide since 1980 ratings for cable news network though still 
small are up 25 percent in 1988 over 1984 
cspan has also become a player although the extent of its

but state sen earl goodwin of selma said tuesday his comment 
was taken out of context when it was broadcast on the

program said later that goodwins remark was a small part of a 
longer interview but that it was not presented out of context 
in the monday night segment featuring the alabama convention 
delegation goodwin was shown commenting my philosophy of the 
things that i think the separation of the races has been for the 
good of the country 
goodwin a white retired businessman and longtime ally of frmer 
gov george wallace said he was talking about the landmark 1954 
brown vs board ruling in which the us supreme court struck down 
the separate but equal doctrine in public schools

conditions for blacks rather than the desegregation set into 
motion by the brown ruling 
he said he told the television reporter that if that means im 
a segregationist then thats what i am 
but he said he does not favor any dismantling of desegregated 
public schools now or a return to legal racial segregation he also 
said he never favored segregation of public facilities 
bus segregation and facilities that was silly to start 
with he said 
appearing before the alabama delegation which is about half

sen edward m kennedy lambasted george bush in a 
convention address citing reagan administration troubles like the 
irancontra affair and leading the packed house in the chant 
where was george 
the vice president says he wasnt there or cant recall or 
never heard as the administration secretly plotted to sell arms to 
iran so when that monumental mistake was being made i think it is 
fair to ask where was george kennedy asked tuesday night 
george bush is the man who is never there and he wont be 
there after the clock strikes noon on jan 20 1989 the senator 
told the democratic national convention 
kennedy listed the irancontra scandal drug trafficking in 
central america and civil rights as political baggage from the 
reagan administration that bush the certain gop presidential 
nominee is trying to avoid 
at least ronald reagan accepts the blame as well as the credit 
for the policies of the last eight years he comes without excuses 
and equivocation he stands up looks us in the eye kennedy 
said but not george bush who on question after question keeps 
burying his head in his hands and hiding from the record of the 
reaganbush mistakes 
kennedy dismissed the gop as the party of ed meese and robert 
bork they are the party of irangate contragate pentagongate 
and they are the party that tolerates apartheid abroad and retreats 
from civil rights at home 
after eight years of complacency and indifference of problems 
untended and pains untreated it is time to restore purpose and 
principle to america 
kennedy also rekindled memories of his brother john and the 
new frontier campaign of 1960 
mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen like john kennedy and lyndon 
johnson believe that we cannot be content with things as they are 
that there is a newer frontier to be crossed and a greater society 
to be built the massachusetts senator said 
kennedy who appears to have completed the transformation from 
presidential heir apparent to party elder without ever achieving 
his own white house ambitions praised dukakis whom he supported 
early in the primary campaign 
i have seen the presidency up close and i have seldom seen 
anyone as matched to the demands and possibilities of that office 
as mike dukakis kennedy said 
the senator a leader of the partys liberal wing also reached 
out to jesse jackson calling him one of the most talented 
individuals in this nation one whose life and words alike give new 
meaning to our oldest ideals he stands for freedom and compassion 
and his effort makes all of us prouder than ever to be americans 
the senator was introduced by his nephew john f kennedy jr 
whose appearance kennedy said touched deep chords of memory and 
hope in democrats and americans everywhere 
kennedy also referred to his own presidential bid telling the 
convention crowd for a long time i have believed that what this 
country needs is another president from massachusetts and now its 
going to happen 
kennedy 56 who is seeking his fifth full senate term this year 
for the seat once occupied by his brother john said the democratic 
party may have lost some elections but we never lost our soul 
and we now know that the struggle has made us stronger that this 
country is ready to move again and we are ready to lead

approved at the partys national convention 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
we the people of the democratic party of the united states of 
america hereby pledge our party our leaders our elected 
officials and our every individual effort to fulfilling the 
following fundamental principles for all members of the american 
family 
we believe that all americans have a fundamental right to 
economic justice in a stronger surer national economy that must 
grow steadily without inflation that can generate a rising 
standard of living for all that as a firstrate world power 
moving into the 21st century we can have a firstrate full 
employment economy 
we believe that the time has come for america to reverse 
seven years of voodoo economics trickle down policies 
fiscal irresponsibility and economic violence against poor and 
working people 
we believe that government should set the standard in 
recognizing that worker productivity is enhanced by safe and 
healthy work places now jeopardized by seven callous years of 
lowered and unenforced occupational safety standards for american 
workers 
we believe that america needs more trade fair trade an 
administration willing to use all the tools available to better 
manage our trade in order to export more american goods and fewer 
american jobs 
we believe that the education of our citizens from head start 
to institutions of higher learning deserves our highest priority 
and that history will judge the next administration less by its 
success in building new weapons of war than by its success in 
improving young minds 
we believe that illegal drugs pose a direct threat to the 
security of our nation from coast to coast that every arm and 
agency of government at every federal state and local level 
should at long last be mobilized and coordinated with private 
efforts under the direction of a national drug czar to halt 
both the international supply and the domestic demand for illegal 
drugs now ravaging our country 
we believe that the federal government should enforce a ban on 
cop killer bullets that have no purpose other than the killing 
and maiming of law enforcement officershelp crime victims 
we believe that we honor our multicultural heritage by assuring 
equal access to government services employment housing business 
enterprise and education to every citizen regardless of race sex 
national origin religion age handicapping condition or sexual 
orientation 
we believe that the housing crisis of the 1980s must be halted 
that homelessness a national shame should be ended in 
america 
we believe that all americans should enjoy access to affordable 
comprehensive health services that the hivaids epidemic is an 
unprecedented public health emergency requiring increased support 
for accelerated research on treatments and vaccines 
comprehensive education and prevention 
we believe that the last seven years have witnessed an 
unprecedented assault on our national interest and national 
security through the poisoning of our air with acid rain the 
dumping of toxic wastes into our water and the destruction of our 
parks and shores

we believe that all americans producers and consumers alike 
benefit when food and fiber are produced not by a few large 
corporations and conglomerates but by hundreds of thousands of 
family farmers obtaining a fair price for their product 
we believe that a balanced coherent energy policy based on 
dependable supplies at reasonable prices is necessary to protect 
our national security ensure a clean environment and promote 
stable economic growth and prosperity 
we believe that this countrys democratic processes must be 
revitalized by supporting statehood for the district of 
columbia by assuring and pledging the full and equal access of 
women and minorities to elective office and party endorsement 
we believe in a clearheaded toughminded decisive american 
foreign policy that will reflect the changing nature of threats to 
our security and respond to them in a way that reflects our values 
that we can neither police the world nor retreat from it and 
that to have reliable allies we must be a reliable ally 
we believe that our national strength has been sapped by a 
defense establishment wasting money on duplicative and dubious new 
weapons instead of investing more in readiness and mobility 
we believe in an america neither gunshy nor triggerhappy 
that will promote peace and prevent war not by trading weapons 
for hostages not by sending brave americans to undefined missions 
in lebanon and honduras but by maintaining a stable nuclear 
deterrent sufficient to counter any soviet threat 
we believe in following up the inf treaty a commendable first 
step with mutual verifiable and enforceable agreements that will 
make significant reductions in strategic weapons in a way that 
diminishes the risk of nuclear attack by either superpower 
we believe in an america that recognizes not only the realities 
of eastwest relations but the challenges and opportunities of the 
developing world that we must enlist the trade surplus nations 
to join with us in supporting new aid initiatives to fuel growth in 
developing countries that though economically depressed are rich 
in human and natural potential 
we believe in an america that will promote human rights human 
dignity and human opportunity in every country on earth 
we believe the apartheid regime in south africa to be a uniquely 
repressive regime that the time has come to declare south 
africa a terrorist state to impose comprehensive sanctions upon 
its economy and to determine a date certain by which united 
states corporations must leave south africa 
in sum we believe it is time for america to change and move 
forward again in the interest of all its families 
we believe that governments at the national state and local 
level exist to help us solve our problems instead of adding to 
them 
therefore the democratic party hereby declares its 
readiness to end the stalemate in washington by challenging the 
american people to do their patriotic best to meet their 
community responsibilities and inviting them to join with us in 
leading the land we love to a brighter and still greater future of 
opportunity and justice for all

wildfires in northern alaska have 
burned an area the size of rhode island and then some but most 
people are oblivious to the blazes as the 49th state weathers its 
worst fire season in 10 years 
in farreaching alaska 1300 square miles of burned acreage is 
like a postage stamp on a parcel here stories of firefighting 
drama are rare the terrain is flatter and less rocky and the days 
longer than in other wildfire states 
we dont have snakes we dont have darkness said bill 
robertson an alaska fire service spokesman we have crews that 
go down to the lower 48 and are amazed 
fifty wildfires one of them burning since april 16 continued 
to burn today in alaskas interior the alaska fire service manned 
about onethird and monitored the others 
a similar outbreak in the lower 48 would have fire managers 
scrambling to protect prime recreation lands and valuable timber 
in fact firefighters were working today to contain a 14000acre 
fire in wyoming and had contained all but two of 15 fires that 
burned more than 20000 acres in colorado 
in alaska the fires have been blistering spindly black spruce 
and other trees with little commercial value 
crews have worked to keep the fires away from a few scattered 
cabins and to control those that sent bothersome smoke into 
fairbanks and other areas in some cases obscuring the mountains 
that draw thousands of summer tourists to the state officials also 
have been concerned about smoke impairing the safety of pilots in 
aviationhappy alaska 
but altogether fire managers have taken a lowkey approach to 
suppression in some areas wildlife biologists are looking forward 
to the enhanced habitat they say moose bears and other animals 
will gain because the burned areas yield new vegetation 
our research shows that most wildlife moves away from fire so 
they arent usually threatened by it said fred deines fire 
management officer for the yukon flats national wildlife refuge 
ultimately the refuge has better habitat to support the wildlife 
when the fire burns out 
only a few of the fires on the yukon flats refuge have been 
manned 
the majority of fires burn with no problem and no action is 
required deines said authorities had no estimate on how long 
the wildfires would continue to burn 
in cases where fire managers did decide to act most of the 
firefighters dispatched were from alaska many of them native 
villagers who were trained together and work in crews of 16 
they arent bringing too many people up from outside said 
bill rockwell a fire information officer at the alaska fire center 
in fairbanks it hasnt gotten to that point yet 
the largest alaska fire is a 225000acre blaze 60 miles north 
of fairbanks that fire moved toward the transalaska oil pipeline 
but was stopped about 12 miles from it the pipeline is covered 
with heavygauge metal and was not threatened by the fire alyeska 
pipeline service co said 
crews working on that and other fires get by on crations 
supplemented by fresh food dropped to them every four days 
robertson said in other states caterers often provide hot meals 
and portable showers at fire camps but the remoteness of the 
alaska sites makes that difficult 
in alaska he said its possible to fight fires with fewer 
people than are needed in other states fires burn slower and less 
erratically with temperatures influencing winds less than they do 
elsewhere 
however its been unusually dry in alaska this year fire 
officials say lightning has caused many of the fires with 
hundreds of strikes per hour recorded by lightningdetection 
equipment 
wind gusts unusual for interior alaska and low humidity have 
also helped to sustain this summers fires robertson said

a school official charged with lewd 
behavior killed himself after making a videotape proclaiming his 
innocence not knowing that his 15yearold accuser had recanted 
her story two days earlier 
i think that somebody somewhere along the line could have told 
somebody that the story had been altered the girls mother told 
the st petersburg times in tuesdays editions 
douglas tarrant 41 pinellas county assistant school 
superintendent for finance died friday in his car of carbon 
monoxide poisoning he was arrested july 11 on a charge of 
committing a lewd and lascivious act 
the 15yearold told police that tarrant asked her to get into 
his car and was masturbating but under questioning july 13 the 
girl said tarrant did nothing more than ask her to get into his 
car according to her mother 
the mother called police and school officials to tell them her 
daughter had recanted the sexual allegation and the teenager was 
asked to give a sworn statement to state prosecutors the session 
was scheduled for july 25 
its too late now i did everything i knew to do the mother 
said after tarrants death 
tarrants family said he was depressed over a serious health 
problem and that his arrest was more than he could handle 
he had worked for the school district since 1971 and was a 
finance official for the past two years he had been on medical 
leave since june because of a serious heart condition that prompted 
two heart attacks 
tarrants brother jeff said the girls mother called him monday 
to tell him what had happened 
she was very upset he said im just too shocked over the 
whole thing 
detective james dressback said the mother called school 
superintendent scott rose on thursday and he referred her to steve 
crosby personnel director who was investigating the accusation 
crosby said he talked to the mother friday morning then called 
tarrant but didnt mention the mothers call because he was unsure 
which story was correct 
i told him that we wanted to straighten out the girls story 
and whether she was being truthful crosby said i told him 
there was some confusion i told him we would request of her mother 
that she take a polygraph exam 
he said thanks for the consideration then he discussed 
meeting with his attorney and i gave him my home phone number and 
asked him to give me a call after he met with his attorney 
when somebodys talking to you about meeting with his attorney 
on monday crosby said you just dont think that he might be 
considering committing suicide

the seven commanders of the 
nicaraguan rebels southern military front resigned late tuesday to 
protest the election of contra military chief enrique bermudez to 
the movements political leadership 
the commanders lead 2700 fighters based in costa rica the 
northern front based in honduras has seven commanders and the 
rest of the contras estimated 12000 soldiers 
bermudez 56 a colonel in the army of anastasio somoza before 
the late rightwing nicaraguan president was deposed was elected 
monday to the sevenmember directorate of the nicaraguan resistance 
the directorate oversees the usbacked insurgency against the 
leftist government of the sandinistas who in 1979 defeated somoza 
a communique released in san jose tuesday night by the seven 
field commanders condemned the placing in charge of the highest 
military post of the insurgents an excolonel of the hated 
somocista national guard 
it also charged bermudez that deliberately withheld us aid for 
the rebels from the southern front to enhance his own power in the 
movement 
the nicaraguan resistance has not in the past nor in the 
present and nor will it in the future fulfill the yearnings and 
hopes of the nicaraguan exiles the statement said 
we want to emphasize that we dont question the right of all 
nicaraguans to participate in the liberation of the fatherland 
it said 
the communique said the decision to resign from the resistance 
was unanimously endorsed by the 2700 fighters on the southern 
front 
it did not say whether they independently would continue their 
war to topple nicaraguas government 
the statement identified the seven by their pseudonyms of ganso 
navegante pedro rafa ramiro johnny ali and omar 
commanders ganso ali omar and navegante participated in 
highlevel peace negotiations between the resistance and the 
sandinistas held in managua 
those talks conducted under a temporary ceasefire agreement 
reached march 23 broke down june 9 
on tuesday president daniel ortega of nicaragua announced a 
unilateral extension of the ceasefire to aug 30 
bermudez was elected during a threeday meeting of the 
resistance the contras umbrella organization that ended tuesday 
in the dominican republic 
the seven commanders said they decided not to attend the meeting 
because they saw the election as a foregone conclusion 
we always have suffered threats and pressures most especially 
on the part of bermudez who with the support of official 
north american sectors notably reduced our us assistance to 
oblige us to submit to the colonel the communique said 
the statement said the southern front had received nothing from 
a sixmonth 17 million us humanitarian aid package approved in 
late march by congress for the contras 
the last deliveries in us military aid were made feb 29 
congress has refused to renew military aid 
of a total 127 million in us assistance the southern front 
commanders said they received just 55 million 
of the 17 million in humanitarian aid the group claimed the 
southern front has received nothing up to the moment while the 
troops in the northern front are supplied in constant form 
evidently patience has its limits it continued given the 
facts and bermudezs apparent motives we believe that we must 
apply the old proverb that says it is better to walk alone than 
to walk with bad company

a chain of 461 beacons part of a series of events 
marking the 400th anniversary of the defeat of the spanish armada 
blazed across england early today to reenact the warning that the 
galleons were approaching 
as then the first fire was lit at kynance a headland near 
lizard village in the southwest tip of cornwall where local people 
say the armada was first sighted sailing up the english channel in 
1588 
but it was a spaniard ambasador don jose de la bellacasa who 
lit the kynance beacon tuesday night 
using a longhandled flaming torch to fire the brazier atop an 
oak pole he parried reporters questions about how he felt 
celebrating one of his countrys more spectacular reverses 
it is not so clear it was a defeat he said with a grin 
you were lucky with the weather 
historians have long argued over which played the greater part 
in the defeat of the armada queen elizabeth is navy or gales 
that decimated the ranks of the spanish ships 
the line of beacons stretched up the country as far as 
berwickupontweed about 450 miles northeast of kynance 
bruno peak the organizer of the event called fire over 
england said i invited the spanish ambassador to light the 
first beacon because i thought it was about time after 400 years 
that we buried this old hatchet in a symbolic way 
the beacon lighting ceremony at kynance and a dramatic fireworks 
display there were shown live on nationwide television 
other celebrities lighting beacons elsewhere included earl 
spencer father of princess diana who fired one at his stately 
home of althorp 65 miles north of london 
britons staged processions pageants and streetdancing and 
thousands donned elizabethan dress and took up pikes and swords 
after rehearsing for weeks 
legend has it that elizabeths favorite captain sir francis 
drake was so unflustered by the armadas approach that he insisted 
on finishing a game of bowls on a lawn at the southwestern port 
city of plymouth 80 miles from kynance before sailing to battle 
as crowds watched a team of actors in elizabeth costumes 
enacted drakes game at plymouth on tuesday 
tamsin thomas who was in charge of 10 of the 20 beacons in 
cornwall said the lizard villagers had been celebrating all day 
as they have done every anniversary for the past four centuries 
queen elizabeth ii will visit plymouth on thursday to join 
armada festivities 
the post office issued 40 million stamps showing galleons and 
cannon smoke and a cereal company offered armada treasure 
replica coins to british breakfasters 
the replicas are copied from coins found in armada ships wrecked 
by gales as the great fleet struggled home after failing to link up 
with a spanish invasion army waiting in the netherlands 
the armadas 125 ships carried 19000 soldiers 8000 sailors 
2000 galley slaves and 180 monks and friars sent by king philip 
ii of roman catholic spain to overthrow englands protestant queen 
elizabeth i 
james mildren a historian specializing in armada lore said of 
the defeat of the armada the weather did help but the defeat was 
a great victory for england because it raised the hearts of men in 
dark hours

engineers are trying to fix a tiny 
gas leak in the space shuttle but theres a 5050 chance discovery 
will have to be rolled back from the launch pad to a hangar for 
repairs says kennedy space centers director 
taking discovery off the pad would delay the first launch since 
the challenger disaster now scheduled for early september by up 
to two months forrest s mccartney told reporters tuesday 
we wish we had found it the leak earlier mccartney said 
if we had found it when it was accessible there would have been 
no problem but its in an inaccessible place and we dont know 
what were going to do about it 
weve got people looking at the prudent and safe thing to do 
whatever course we take there will be no compromise in flight 
safety 
the odds are 5050 on a rollback mccartney said 
he said no decision was likely until after discoverys three 
main engines have been testfired on the pad in a critical test set 
for july 28 the main engines are separate from the steering engine 
system where the leak is 
the tiny nitrogen tetroxide gas leak was detected friday in an 
engine compartment and was traced to a fitting on a line leading 
to an oxidizer tank nitrogen tetroxide normally combines with fuel 
to power the steering engines 
shuttle managers were combing through documents to determine 
whether workers might have missed a similar leak as early as last 
january 
launch director bob sieck said paperwork showed that a pressure 
check was made on the oxidizer tank manifold in an engine 
compartment before christmas and that a second reading taken two 
weeks later showed a pressure drop 
the pressure drop occurred in the same area as the one detected 
in january 
we are reviewing all procedures and documentation and 
equipment associated with that event sieck said 
the earlier readings may have been within specifications he 
said and i wouldnt preclude the fact that we have other data 
that says the integrity of the joint was confirmed 
until a final review is in it is pure speculation that a 
requirement was violated and not reported sieck said 
the problem with fixing the leak on the pad is that the 
22foottall engine compartment probably would have to be removed 
a difficult task never done there before 
another option would be to take discovery to a hangar and 
replace the compartment as soon as possible with one being prepared 
for a november flight by atlantis such a move would eliminate the 
need to wait for a leak repair and could cut the launch delay to 
about a month 
flying with the leak is a possibility but we would have to 
assure ourselves that it would be absolutely safe sieck said a 
possible danger is that during the return to earth the nitrogen 
tetroxide would mix with water in the atmosphere and form corrosive 
nitric acid 
discovery is being grooomed to make the first shuttle mission 
since challenger exploded jan 28 1986 killing all seven crew 
members five veteran shuttle astronauts are to make the fourday 
flight

hoover institution director w glenn 
campbell who for nearly three decades has led the think tank that 
launched many of the conservative ideas and leaders of the reagan 
presidency says he will step down next year 
campbell said he hopes his move will end the academic political 
and legal dispute that has split the liberal stanford university 
campus and angered conservatives from california to washington and 
wall street 
campbell said he will remain at hoover in an advisory role and 
will hold the title of counselor serve as member of all selection 
and advisory committees and stay in his office formerly occupied 
by founder and president herbert hoover 
i used to be a young warrior now im an aging warrior but not 
yet an old warrior he said in a twohour interview monday with 
the associated press before presenting his proposal to hoovers 
board of overseers 
campbell a close friend of president reagan and a member of his 
original kitchen cabinet said the hoover institution on war 
revolution and peace will remain on the stanford campus and keep 
its financial and academic independence as a policy research center 
hoover has been a frequent target of criticism by stanford 
faculty and students who disapprove of its conservative political 
activities and ties to the reagan administration 
reagan an honorary fellow at hoover charted his course as 
california governor and in the white house with the help of 
advisers from hoover including economists martin anderson and 
milton friedman 
departing attorney general edwin meese iii recently accepted 
campbells invitation to join hoover as a visiting fellow while he 
writes a book on his years with reagan 
campbell who has led hoover since 1960 proposes to step aside 
as director after he turns 65 next april but remain in the job 
until his successor takes over at the end of next summer 
anderson called campbell the premier intellectual entrepreneur 
of the century but said his move makes a lot of sense 
anderson will sit on a 10person search committee for campbells 
successor 
james gaither stanford trustee president said he thought 
campbell made the right decision and hoped it would bring the 
different sides together on campus 
there have been problems in the past obviously but were 
committed to working together to improve relations between stanford 
and hoover gaither said im very happy that dr campbell has 
chosen to help resolve those problems 
campbells surprise announcement comes two months after he vowed 
to sue stanford if it tried to oust him at 65 five years before he 
planned to leave on the grounds it was the customary retirement 
age at the university 
campbell who noted several exceptions to the rule called 
stanfords action an attempted takeover motivated by politics 
and greed 
stanford president donald kennedy and former trustees president 
warren christopher were carter administration officials and the 
majority of faculty are democrats 
campbell an unabashed conservative republican said the problem 
between hoover and stanford is not as simple as politics alone 
all these people at stanford want is the money and 
buildings said campbell whose large woodpaneled office is on 
the 11th floor of the landmark hoover tower in the center of campus 
gaither anderson and others said they believed campbell decided 
to step down as a constructive move to avoid further strains that 
might hurt the images of hoover and stanford 
campbell a harvard economist who once had former federal 
reserve board chairman paul volcker as a student was selected by 
former president hoover as his successor at the institution 
campbells fundraising helped boost a 2 million endowment to 
its current level of more than 110 million 
the hoover institution is among the nations premier think 
tanks a place where more than 100 scholars policy makers and 
leaders write books and articles on foreign affairs national 
security and economics 
they meet regularly to exchange ideas often while munching 
cookies at the ritual midday coffee hour

the seven commanders of the 
nicaraguan rebels southern military front have quit in protest of 
the election to the movements political leadership of contra 
military chief enrique bermudez 
the commanders who resigned late tuesday lead 2700 rebel 
fighters the rest of the contras estimated 12000 guerrillas are 
based in honduras 
bermudez 56 a colonel in the army of anastasio somoza before 
the late rightwing nicaraguan president was deposed was elected 
monday to the sevenmember directorate of the nicaraguan resistance 
the directorate oversees the usbacked insurgency against the 
leftist government of the sandinistas who led the revolution that 
defeated somoza in 1979 many contras backed the revolution but 
later became disaffected with the sandinistas 
a communique released in san jose tuesday night by the seven 
field commanders condemned the placing in charge of the highest 
military post of the insurgents an excolonel of the hated 
somocista national guard 
dissidents have accused him of being inefficient corrupt and 
too close to somoza supporters 
the communique charged that bermudez deliberately withheld us 
aid for southern front rebels to enhance his own power in the 
movement 
the nicaraguan resistance has not in the past nor in the 
present and nor will it in the future fulfill the yearnings and 
hopes of the nicaraguan exiles the statement said 
we want to emphasize that we dont question the right of all 
nicaraguans to participate in the liberation of the fatherland 
it said 
the resign commanders said their decision to leave the 
resistance was unanimously endorsed by the 2700 fighters they 
command whom they claim represent 40 percent of the contra forces 
the communique did not say whether they would independently 
continue effprts to topple nicaraguas government

congress has refused to renew military aid 
of a total 127 million in us assistance the southern front 
commanders said they received just 55 million 
bermudezs position in the resistance was enhanced during the 
santo domingo meeting by the reelection of his closest ally on the 
directorate aristedes sanchez and of alfredo cesar who spoke 
strongly in favor of his candidacy 
newly elected director wilfredo montalvan also was seen as a 
bermudez supporter but the allegiances of roberto ferrey and 
wycliffe diego were less clear 
ferrey replaces his sister azucena who decided not to seek 
reelection and diego fills a vacant seat representing nicaraguas 
atlantic coast indians and creoles bermudez won a second vacant 
seat 
adolfo calero 56 who as the directorates senior member had 
been regarded as its political head also was reelected he is a 
rival of bermudez 
calero dismissed suggestions that the colonels election would 
lessen chances that congress will resume military aid to the 
contras 
pedro joaquin chamorro who was ousted from the directorate 
said he thought bermudez was determined to take absolute control of 
the resistance 
i dont think he has total control but that his clearly his 
intention said chamorro a 36yearold former nicaraguan 
journalist 
in april calero and chamorro sided with dissidents who tried 
but failed to strip bermudez of his military command after he fired 
six commanders in honduras for mutiny

a 13yearold boy who was accused of 
stealing a 45cent package of baseball cards shot and killed 
himself an hour later authorities said 
the victim who died in an aurora hospital early tuesday was 
not identified by police 
the youngster was accused of shoplifting the baseball cards from 
a convenience store near his aurora home said police division 
chief mike stiers 
a police officer summoned by the stores clerk issued the boy a 
citation that ordered him to appear with a parent in court next 
month the officer then contacted the boys mother 
the next call we got was from the sister indicating that the 
boy had shot himself stiers said

people in the case military intelligence sources said fbi agents 
were in san pedro sula to work on the case

november election michael barnes the former maryland congressman 
who worked on the platform for dukakis said nothing in the 
document would in any way commit the next congress or commit the 
next president even theoretically to any specific spending

taxes on the wealthy and a pledge not to be the first to use 
nuclear weapons jackson withdrew a demand for a fiveyear freeze

when geraldine ferraro strode to the podium at 
the democratic national convention four years ago there was 
rejoicing that a woman had finally demolished a historic barrier 
and joined the ticket of a major us political party 
but that was then and this was now 
women are insiders not outsiders at the 1988 convention 
theyre no longer toasting their triumphs and spoiling for new 
battles theyre down in the political trenches alongside men 
taking quiet satisfaction at the thought that the democrats are 
about to nominate a presidential candidate michael dukakis who 
supports them on most issues 
gerry was the pioneer said rep mary rose oakar dohio 
i listened to her speech again at 2 oclock this morning and it 
still brought tears to my eyes 
women activists agree theres little taste for making history in 
atlanta 
we dont see the focus because we dont have the ticket even 
if we did have a woman on the ticket there wouldnt be the same 
emotion 
were now into the nuts and bolts of things said ms oakar 
who is cochairman of the atlanta conventions platform committee 
what women did was the smart thing 
although there is disagreement over ms ferraros impact on the 
outcome of the 1984 election there is no doubt that she galvanized 
women and spurred others to run for public office 
women are seen speaking from the podium cheering from the 
convention floor as delegates and running convention committees 
most polls indicate that women are contributing heavily to dukakis 
strong showing against republican candidate george bush 
people keep acting like were banished says rep pat 
schroeder dcolo were not banished were under the tent 
these guys are hard to break through says new york delegate 
bella abzug a former congresswoman it doesnt come overnight 
the gender gap has proven once and for all they need to appeal 
to women said celinda lake a washingtonbased pollster who 
researches womens issues they may not know how to do it but 
they know theyre supposed to 
democratic women seem determined to eliminate disputes and 
present a united front theres no reason to be on the streets at 
this convention ms lake said 
theres a lot to be said for jumping up and down and those of 
us on the inside love to do it said iowa democratic chairwoman 
bonnie campbell is it as much fun it will be the night of nov 
8 
she added i think its directly attributable to the sense of 
pragmatism that seems to be permeating everything this year i 
think now theres a sense of being on good behavior it is part of 
the evolution of the movement 
veteran feminist gloria steinem says theres no reason for women 
to fight when dukakis is on their side 
hes great on all our issues she said we dont need to 
kick up our heels 
movements go through stages she added 
the movement is still at the stage of developing a 
consensus said monica mcfadden head of governmental relations 
for the national federation of business and professional women 
gesturing toward a meeting of women activists she said you 
ask this group what the most important item on the agenda is and 
youll get 74 different answers

they are here with brave faces and dashed hopes 
listening to speeches they hoped to make watching the coronation 
they fought for they are the alsorans of 1988 and they had other 
plans for this week 
obviously there are mixed feelings said sen paul simon of 
illinois who gave up his democratic primary campaign april 7 after 
washing out in wisconsin youd like to be where mike is 
gov michael dukakis is a day away from the victory speech that 
will cap his long fight for the partys nomination a year ago he 
was with the rest of them scrabbling for serious attention 
ridiculed for lacking stature 
he gained both by outlasting his opponents and all but one were 
on hand to see him claim the spoils they did so ungrudgingly most 
with expressions of support but with a tinge of wistfulness at what 
might have been 
i enjoyed it i had a great time sen albert gore jr of 
tennessee said tuesday night looking back on his 10month 
campaign he called it quits on april 21 whipped in new york and 
21 million in debt 
the debts been retired and the lessons been learned gore 
said if he were to do it again and he may i would start 
earlier 
but there are pitfalls other than too little time as the 
vanquished veterans of the democratic campaign will attest few 
started earlier than gary hart who finished second in 1984 and was 
favored to win this time 
a dalliance with a model spelled the hart campaigns demise in 
may 1987 though he tried a comeback that sputtered through super 
tuesday before he quit for keeps on march 11 hart is in atlanta 
as a newspaper columnist and a commentator for italian television 
no he said this week hes not resentful about the race im 
grateful to be alive and to be here his viewpoint while it may 
reach fewer people now is unchanged from the iconoclastic message 
of his campaign everybody at the convention he said keeps 
their sights too low 
a second former candidate has switched to the other side of the 
notebook former arizona gov bruce babbitt whose quick wit won 
him favorable media reviews but few votes he hung up his campaign 
running shoes feb 18 and came to atlanta as a newspaper and 
television commentator 
though he was speaking of former president carter babbitts 
thoughts in his column tuesday could have been a reflection on his 
own fortunes ive always thought that the true test of character 
is what politicians do when the lights go out and humbled by 
defeat they make the long trip back home 
but there was a hint of frustration at his failed effort too 
nothing happens at a convention anymore he told an 
interviewer they dont even put our names in nomination anymore 
there is nothing but spectators 
babbitt is more than a spectator though he is a delegate 
pledged to dukakis similarly rep richard gephardt of missouri 
who gave up his campaign march 28 is here as a dukakis delegate 
gephardt told his fellow delegates tuesday he had been given a 
fair shot at the presidency he ran he said because i could not 
bear the thought of sitting on the west side of the capitol next 
january watching them swear in george bush and having to turn to 
one of my colleagues and say why didnt we do something about 
this 
of the two other men who sought and lost the 1988 democratic 
nomination one remained the most in the public eye the other the 
least 
sen joseph biden of delaware quit sept 23 amid charges he 
borrowed speeches without attribution and had been accused of 
plagiarism as a college student he was at home this week 
convalescing from surgery for an aneurysm near his brain 
the other was jesse jackson who lasted the course with dukakis 
and addressed the convention tuesday night though he knew he could 
not win jackson at least had the solace of speaking the words all 
his former rivals had set as their goal 
hope is eternal he said tomorrow night my name will go 
into nomination for the presidency of the united states

winstonsalem nc ap at least three of the four people 
killed by a man with a rifle were gunned down at pointblank range 
while sheriffs deputies crouched behind their cruisers some 40 
yards away witnesses said 
they didnt fire at all said adrian hodges who watched 
from a bank parking lot there was two of them i seen them 
leaning against their cars with their hands across the cars i 
assume they had their guns out 
forsyth county sheriffs department officials on tuesday 
declined to discuss any details relating to the shooting saying 
that an investigation is not complete 
after deputies arrived at the scene late sunday night witnesses 
said they saw the gunman shoot at least three people witnesses 
were unsure if the fourth victim was shot after deputies had 
arrived 
five other motorists were wounded by the gunman identified by 
police as michael charles hayes 24 hayes family had tried to 
have him committed to a mental hospital the day before the shooting 
hayes was in satisfactory condition today at north carolina 
baptist hospital where he was being treated for gunshot wounds 
suffered in a shootout with deputies authorities have charged him 
with two counts of firstdegree murder 
deputies blocked only northbound traffic on one street with 
their parked cars leaving open a road from the east and west and 
another road southbound from winstonsalem hodges and other 
witnesses said cars continued to drive into the gunmans range 
during the 12minute rampage they said 
sheriffs department officials refused to say how many deputies 
were at the scene 
ronald hull one of the four killed was eastbound with his 
wife darlene and son his brother david hull said the roadblock 
prompted his brother to turn directly into the path of the gunman 
people were shot before my brother even entered the area 
hull said i just cant comprehend why they the deputies did 
what they did they put the traffic right into the middle of it 
recounting his brothers final moments he said the man 
jumped out in front of him and told him to stop hollering and 
waving a gun he told him to cut his truck off and turn his 
inside light on 
ron raised his hands off the steering wheel and said 
anything you say just dont hurt my family and the boy busted 
the window out and put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger 
the gunman also wounded ronald hulls wife 
hull insisted the sheriffs department should have blocked all 
routes leading past hayes moped shop even though it was near the 
border of neighboring davidson county 
i think the sheriffs department is to blame he said if 
they had crossed that county line and blocked both roads then my 
brother wouldnt have been involved in it i think they put the 
roadblock in the wrong place

a revised estimate that the aids virus has 
infected half as many new yorkers as thought could change national 
figures says the citys top health official but a federal 
spokesman contends its too early to tell 
city health commissioner dr stephen joseph said he informed the 
federal centers for disease control on tuesday about the revision 
from 400000 infected new york residents to 200000 
since new york represents 23 percent of the aids cases 
nationally if they accept our methodology it will make some 
changes in their estimates joseph told a news conference 
the cdc estimates 1 million to 15 million americans are 
infected with the virus that causes acquired immune defiency 
syndrome 
its really too early to tell if it will affect our figures 
said cdc spokesman charles fallis in atlanta at this point 
were sticking with what we originally said 
the new estimate does not mean there will be a change in 
projections of how many aids cases there will be in the early 
1990s because those forecasts are based on cases of people who 
actually have aids joseph said 
new york has been using the old estimate of 400000 for nearly 
three years 
it was based on decadesold data from research by alfred charles 
kinsey which estimated that one out of 10 men engaged in homosexual 
behavior and on surveys indicating there was a 50 percent aids 
virus infection rate among homosexual men 
the cdc bases its estimates on the same data 
the city estimates that by 1991 there will be 43000 aids 
patients needing serious medical treatment in new york that figure 
was based on trends of past and current aids cases which we are 
quite confident are accurate joseph said 
the same cannot be said of the number of people infected with 
the aids virus that figure always has been just an estimate 
and one that at times varies widely joseph said 
the new figure is based on recent studies in san francisco on 
the number of infected homosexuals there 
the new york figure is based on the hypothesis that the ratio of 
the number of homosexual men with aids to the number of infected 
gay men is about the same in the two cities joseph said 
there are 7499 homosexual men in new york with aids and 4071 
in san francisco using that ratio and data that estimates there 
are 27517 infected homosexual and bisexual men in san francisco 
officials theorize there are an estimated 50000 infected gay men 
in new york rather than the previously estimated 200000 to 
250000 
the number is significant because most health officials now 
agree that nearly all of those carrying the virus will get aids 
joseph said the san francisco data were considered more valid 
than old data because they are based on a much smaller tighter 
more homogeneous situation and because san francisco is further 
ahead than anyone else in terms of blood test data 
the number of intravenous drug users believed to be carrying the 
virus is unchanged joseph said about 100000 of the approximately 
200000 intravenous drug users are estimated to be infected 
 
joseph also said the revision will not affect funding for aids 
prevention or services 
the new estimate came out just two months after the city 
released a fiveyear master plan based on the old figure under 
which new york would spend 334 million on prevention education 
and services 
it would really be a mistake for anybody or any group to take 
these figures and say because of that we can do less or because of 
that we can do differently joseph said those expenditures 
will need to stay where they are

the use of balloons to open up damaged aortic 
heart valves should be reserved for people who are too old and sick 
to undergo surgery to repair the condition according to a new 
study 
the balloon technique is used as an alternative to surgery in 
people whose heart valves dont work properly 
however young otherwise healthy patients with aortic valve 
narrowing should have surgery to replace the valve dr peter c 
block of massachusetts general hospital wrote in an editorial 
accompanying a report on the study 
the report is in the latest new england journal of medicine 
which comes out thursday 
the study directed by dr robert d safian of beth israel 
hospital in boston examined the balloon techniques value in 
people with malfunctioning aortic valves which allow blood to flow 
into the aorta the bodys main artery 
in about half of the 170 patients treated the valves narrowed 
up again within a year of the procedure six of the patients whose 
average age was 77 died in the hospital and about threefourths 
survived at least a year 
block wrote that the balloon procedure may be useful for frail 
and sick elderly people who have other heart problems 
but he said elderly patients who have no other medical problems 
and are strong and willing to undergo surgery should be advised to 
choose surgery 
results have been more promising when the balloon procedure is 
used to relieve narrowing of the mitral valve which controls the 
flow of blood into the left ventricle the hearts main pumping 
chamber 
in another study reported in the journal doctors concluded that 
openheart surgery can be effective for people in their 80s they 
reviewed the cases of 50 such people who underwent coronary bypass 
or valve replacement operations 
they calculated that 59 percent would still be alive after three 
years and 54 percent after five years 
the report written by dr l henry edmunds jr and others at 
the university of pennsylvania concludes that surgery is a 
reasonable therapeutic option in elderly people who cannot be 
treated in other ways even though death and complication rates are 
high

zia of arbitrarily dissolving the assembly and disrupting a 
democratic system which was operating smoothly 
some critics said the constitution requires elections within 90 
days of the dissolution of parliament

religious holiday among shiite moslems the monsoon season the 
absence of 80000 to 90000 pilgrims in mecca and the need to 
redraw districts to reflect population shifts 
elections will be free fair and independent he said the

politics clean democracy and clean democratic institutions 
he offered an apology of sorts for his criticism of former 
elected officials if anyone has felt hurt by this i express my 
regrets my intention was not to hurt anyone or assassinate 
anyones character 
some opposition leaders have accused zia supporters and former 
cabinet members with corruption since zia seized power in a 1977 
military coup 
zia overthrew zulfikar ali bhutto who was hanged in 1979 his 
daughter benazir bhutto heads pakistans strongest opposition

fire crews used picks and shovels today as they tried to stop a 
14000acre wyoming wildfire from spreading into yellowstone 
national park where other fires charred nearly 13000 acres of 
backcountry 
in alaska 50 fires one of them burning since april 16 
covered about 450000 acres in remote inland areas but officials 
left most of them to burn because there was no threat to lives or 
property 
fires also burned in parts of california colorado utah and 
oregon 
the blaze in wyomings bridgerteton national forest wilderness 
area edged to within two miles of yellowstone 
crews brought industrial sprinklers and miles of plastic hose to 
moisten yellowstone meadows a popular recreational area on the 
forests border with the national park 
firefighters had little more than picks shovels and the water 
tanks they carry on their backs to fight the flames because of 
wilderness area restrictions they used natural firebreaks such as 
meadows streams and rock outcroppings to stop the fire 
the fire continues to show the vulnerability and explosiveness 
of the fuels us forest service spokesman fred kingwill said 
it is very very dry its been dry for a number of years 
its a fire condition that probably very few people have seen 
before 
the rugged territory at an elevation of about 8500 feet and in 
prime grizzly bear habitat has forced officials to use helicopters 
to shuttle firefighters around 
in yellowstone officials monitored several fires covering 
12850 acres imposed campfire restrictions throughout the 
backcountry and closed some backcountry campsites other campsites 
and yellowstone roads remained open

palestinians attacked soldiers stoned buses 
and closed shops today to protest the unsolved killing of a 
teenager israeli troops fatally shot two demonstrators and 
wounded seven 
the army said troops fatally shot one palestinian as he tried to 
throw a firebomb at a military patrol the other died in 
circumstances that were still under investigation 
police in jerusalem fired rubber bullets and tear gas at 
hundreds of palestinian protesters including children in a 
schoolyard near the church of the holy sepulcher where tradition 
says jesus is buried 
the violence was triggered by tuesdays shooting death of 
15yearold nidal fuad rabadi as he rode his bicycle near jerusalem 
city limits and by a tour of the temple mount today by rightwing 
israeli legislators 
arab reporters and israel television said the boy may have been 
shot by israeli civilians who got off a bus to chase stonethrowing 
youths 
the fatalities raised to 227 the number of palestinians killed 
since the uprising began dec 8 against israels 21year occupation 
of the west bank and gaza strip four israelis also have died 
the army said a palestinian identified by hospital officials as 
zaki halaykeh 23 was killed when he tried to throw a firebomb at 
a military patrol in shuyukh village near the west bank city of 
hebron 
officals at nearby alia hospital said halaykeh was shot through 
the back three other youths in shuyukh were wounded in a clash 
with troops the army said 
in the northern west bank town of jenin hisham zaid 26 died 
after being shot in the chest by troops during a stone throwing an 
official at jenin hospital said four palestinians were wounded in 
the clash the army said 
violence broke out in jerusalem shortly after three legislators 
of the tehiya party toured the temple mount under heavy police 
guard the compound is sacred to both jews and moslems 
legislator geula cohen told reporters the tour was to coincide 
with the hebrew lunar calendar month of av when the ancient jewish 
temple was destroyed by the romans about 2000 years ago 
in arab east jerusalem today police blocked rabadis friends 
from paying condolence calls to his family home and merchants 
staged a strike refusing to open their stores on the main salah 
eddin shopping street 
palestinian shopkeeper abed alka said protesters in the old city 
shouted slogans such as whose state is palestine 
more than 50 palestinian aged 6 to 8 fled the al aytem school 
when soldiers fired tear gas 
angry protesters stoned israeli buses including one carrying 
tourists an arabowned vehicle and a police van israel radio said 
a woman and a policeman were injured by rocks 
an investigation into the circumstances of rabadis death was 
delayed by a disagreement between police and army officials over 
whether the shooting occurred within jerusalems city limits where 
israeli law applies 
police officials contend the army is responsible for the west 
bank 
jerusalem police chief yossi yehudai told reporters today that 
he had visited the site of the shooting near the arab neighborhood 
of beit hanina but found no witnesses to the attack 
yehudai did not rule out the possibility the killing was linked 
the palestinian uprising but said he also believed this could be 
a criminal case he refused to elaborate 
also today the head of jerusalems moslem religious council 
sheikh salah el din al alami met diplomats from eight countries 
including the united states and urged them to intervene to halt an 
israeli archaeological excavation beneath the temple mount compound 
the dig to uncover an ancient tunnel touched off a violent 
demonstration in the old city two weeks ago 
israels state television decided it would no longer cover 
israelis protesting military service in the occupied territories 
the jerusalem post reported since the uprising began 29 israelis 
have served jail terms for refusing to serve in the disputed lands 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said israel would cut services to 
palestinians in the occupied territories because of a 40 percent 
decline in tax collections during the uprising army radio reported

the bodies of three children and an adult 
who drowned trying to save them were found a day after they were 
swept into the mississippi river from a droughtweakened sandbar 
that apparently collapsed authorities said 
the bodies were taken tuesday night to baptist hospital here 
where family members identified them said hospital personnel 
director peggy holmes 
the victims were identified as erika gould 5 her 6yearold 
brother chris rusty may 2 and his father ed may 33 all of 
lauderdale county 
the children were apparently swept into the river monday evening 
as may and lyndell gould jr the gould childrens father worked 
nearby on an allterrain vehicle said lauderdale county chief 
sheriffs deputy charles love 
gould a county sheriffs investigator had been riding one 
allterrain vehicle with his children and may was on another with 
his son before they stopped on the sandbar to make repairs love 
said 
the three children had gone to the waters edge to cool off 
while the men worked love said when the youngsters disapeared 
their fathers began searching for them in the growing darkness 
they looked around and the kids werent there ed and lyn 
jumped in the river and ed never did come up he said 
gould who dived into the river several times after may went 
under was released tuesday from baptist hospital after treatment 
for shock and exhaustion 
nearly 100 rescue workers and volunteers used at least 10 boats 
to drag the river for the four and the highway patrol searched by 
helicopter 
the four disappeared in an area 54 miles north of memphis and 13 
miles west of ripley 
a towboat that passed by just minutes before the men noticed the 
children gone could have created an undertow love said also the 
river drops off sharply where the three children stood he said 
the sandbar is behind a dike that creates a whirlpool love said 
theres a lot of current down there the swirling motion from 
the dike could have carried them back up the river he said 
three people drowned near natchez miss last month when a 
sandbar they were walking on collapsed since the mississippi began 
falling to record lows this summer hundreds of sightseers and 
souvenir hunters have been drawn to the river the us coast guard 
has issued warnings advising people to stay clear of sandbars 
uncovered by the low water 
when the river falls it makes sandbars accessible to people 
and theyre sometimes undermined by the current underneath coast 
guard petty officer garland mcdowell said

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said today 
that accepting a un resolution calling for a ceasefire in the 
iraniraq war was worse than drinking poison but that irans 
political leaders recommended it be done 
it was the first statement from the 87yearold leader since 
iran announced monday it was accepting the resolution passed by the 
security council on july 20 1987 
iraq called the announcement a trick to buy time 
also today an iraqi military spokesman said two iranian jet 
fighters tried to bomb the dokan dam near the northern city of 
kirkuk but were chased off by antiaircraft fire 
the jets dropped their bombs but missed the target according to 
iraqi press reports monitored in cyprus the spokesman was not 
identified 
iran and iraq have been at war since september 1980 
khomeini said he could not detail the reasons why the countrys 
political leaders asked him to end the war but said he decided to 
accept their recommendation he did not refer to any leaders by 
name 
hashemi rafsanjani speaker of irans parliament and 
commanderinchief of irans armed forces said monday that 
khomeini made the decision to accept the resolution 
khomeini had previously rejected all attempts to end the war 
saying iran would continue fighting until iraqi president saddam 
hussein was overthrown 
resolution 598 calls for a ceasefire in the war a return to 
the international borders of 1980 an exchange of prisoners and an 
investigation to determine who started the conflict 
khomeini in a statement carried by iranian media and monitored 
in nicosia said accepting the resolution does not mean the war is 
over 
the approval of the un resolution does not mean that the 
problem of the war has been solved his statement said 
khomeini said many of his countrys problems could be traced to 
american opposition to the 1979 islamic revolution 
he said iran will continue to battle american influence in the 
region and said that foreign navies should leave the gulf 
i hearby warn the american and european military forces to 
leave the persian gulf before it is too late he said 
in the gulf shipping sources confirmed that iraq bombed an 
unfinished nuclear plant at the iranian port of bushehr and an 
unfinished petrochemical plant at bandar khomeini in the northern 
gulf 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
petrochemical complex was still burning late tuesday 
the ranking republican on the house armed services committee 
said the united states could begin pulling its warships out of the 
gulf as soon as a ceasefire takes effect 
rep william dickinson of alabama spoke during a visit to the 
gulf tuesday 
the extraction of our forces is going to be very simple he 
said in an interview we dont have anything on the ground all 
we have to do is wind that ship up and go 
until a year ago the united states had had a small naval force 
in the gulf since 1948 now it has 27 warships in the region about 
17 of them in the gulf at any time 
war communiques from tehran said the iraqi raids at bushehr and 
bandar khomeini were barbaric and that iranian warplanes 
retaliated by raiding a dam at lake darbandikhan near kirkuk 140 
miles northeast of baghdad 
foreign minister tariq aziz of iraq said irans decision to 
accept the security council resolution was twofaced and 
aiming at winning time to launch surprise offensives in the 
war which began in september 1980 
iran said the iraqi air raids were proof baghdad opposes an end 
to the war 
tehrans official islamic republic news agency quoted the head 
of irans atomic energy organization reza amrollahi as saying the 
iraqi raid on the nuclear plant inflicted heavy losses 
amrollahi said in a letter to the viennabased international 
atomic energy agency it was the seventh attack on the unfinished 
facility in four years the news agency reported

beretta the italian arms manufacturer favored 
by james bond is gunning for general motors corp claiming in a 
250 million lawsuit that the automakers fourwheeled beretta is a 
trademark violation 
fabrica darmi p beretta spa which calls itself the oldest 
manufacturer of arms in the world went after gm when the automaker 
unveiled the chevrolet beretta in 1987 despite warning letters 
from beretta lawyers the previous year 
the 500yearold italian armsmaking dynasty had registered 
trademarks in this country for the beretta name as far back as 1954 
the lawsuit filed in federal court here tuesday said beretta 
pistols are the standard military sidearm in several countries 
including the united states which signed an 80 million contract 
for 315000 pistols in 1985 
it also noted that in novels where price is no object the 
italianmade pistols are the weapon of choice for numerous 
fictional spies and detectives including agent 007 
in detroit general motors issued a statement saying that no 
basis for the suit exists because there is no likelihood for 
confusion as to the source of those vehicles between gm and the 
beretta gun company 
the gm employee who selected the beretta name was unaware of 
the existence of the beretta gun company the automaker said 
moreover in the united states it is not uncommon that vehicle 
models and firearms have the same names such as colt and marlin 
berettas lawsuit claiming that the beretta automobile is the 
subject of a recall and possibly can cause serious harm also 
charged that the cars problems could cause further damage to the 
beretta weapons business 
gm spokesman james w crellin said the beretta a compact sport 
coupe has had two minor recalls for a hood latch and a 
headlamp switch 
the italian company makes luggage clothing cutlery and optical 
equipment as well as target hunting and military guns

soviet inspectors today began 
inspecting us nuclear missiles at two british bases greenham 
common and molesworth the us military said 
the 20member soviet team arrived tuesday from moscow for the 
first inspection of bases in britain under the superpower arms 
treaty to dismantle mediumrange nuclear missiles 
soviet team leader vyacheslav s lebedev detailed the inspection 
plan to col john fer of the us onsite inspection agency 
half of the soviets remained at greenham which has 96 missiles 
and five spares and the rest traveled on a threehour bus ride to 
molesworth near cambridge which has 16 missiles 
greenham common is 50 miles west of london molesworth is 50 
miles north of london 
the soviet inspectors spent the night at refurbished 
servicemens quarters at the heart of the greenham common base 
on tuesday night us officers took the team on a bus tour of 
the base it included a visit to a gift shop the black knight 
where they bought small british souvenirs using american currency 
peace protesters who have camped outside the greenham common 
base since before cruise missiles began arriving from the united 
states in november 1983 said they wanted to give a letter to the 
visiting soviets 
the liberal guardian newspaper said the letter read in russian 
we are glad you are making a start on dismantling these terrible 
weapons we hope its the beginning of total disarmament 
lebedev said tuesday that since the inspections began this month 
in the united states the soviet union and west germany no one 
seemed to be cheating 
the experience of the inspections has shown that the ussr 
and united states strictly implemented the treaty signed by them 
and the first steps as to its realization are successful he said 
he spoke through an interpreter from behind a podium emblazoned 
with the emblem of the 16nation north atlantic treaty organization 
the greenham common base commander col richard r riddick 
promised the soviet inspectors help in carrying out your 
specified duties 
the inspections are part of a 60day period of inspections that 
started july 1 to check whether each side told the truth about 
deployments 
the soviets are visiting 30 sites in the united states and five 
western european countries while us inspectors are visiting 133 
soviet sites no violations have been reported 
the intermediate nuclear forces treaty signed in december 
provides for the elimination of all landbased missiles in europe 
with ranges of 300 to 3000 miles 
each side has the right to make 20 shortnotice inspections a 
year at bases until 1991 when all the missiles and their launchers 
should have been destroyed and to make periodic inspections for a 
decade thereafter 
the soviets have the right to enter any buildings they suspect 
could accommodate missiles and additionally can post inspectors at 
base gates to ensure no missiles are removed 
the missiles and their 55foot mobile launchers are housed in 
bunkers the soviets will not see the warheads which do not have 
to be destroyed under the treaty 
the soviets told the americans on monday evening that they were 
coming tuesday under terms of the 16hour notice each side must 
give they are allowed 24 hours for each inspection and can ask for 
eight more hours they must submit a report before they leave

after a jury cleared a young man in 
the machinegun slayings of two relatives of fashion designer 
albert nipon a prosecutor said officials were still seeking 
evidence against others who might be involved 
michael wolcoff heaved a sigh of relief tuesday after a broward 
circuit court jury cleared him of murdering edward and sylvia nipon 
of hallandale 
its hard for an american jury to convict a 20yearold kid 
who may have been peripherally involved if they dont know 
specifically what happened defense attorney t don tenbrook said 
after the verdict 
nipon 58 retired president of his brothers designer clothing 
company albert nipon inc and his 67yearold wife were shot to 
death at their beachfront condominium in 1987 prosecutors 
described the slayings as a professional hit 
wolcoff was identified as one of two people who visited the 
nipons the night they were killed and assistant state attorney 
chuck morton argued that although wolcoff did not shoot the nipons 
he played a key role in the plot 
the scheme was devised by sylvia nipons soninlaw bernard 
rubin the prosecutor said 
rubin had borrowed about 100000 from edward nipon for a 
loansharking or moneylaundering scheme morton said when nipon 
demanded his money back rubin feared he would go to authorities 
and ordered that the couple be killed the prosecutor said 
rubin and another suspect in the deaths reputed mob hit man 
stanley diamond have not been charged although morton said 
investigators continue to seek evidence against them 
wolcoffs lawyer argued that his client was a pawn used by the 
killers to mislead and confuse the police court testimony never 
revealed who the triggerman was 
more clues about the killings may surface during the august 
trial of michael wolcoffs father burton wolcoff who also faces 
murder charges in the nipons deaths 
burton wolcoff helped hide the weapon and a diamond pinky ring 
taken from edward nipon the night he was killed morton said during 
the younger wolcoffs trial 
morton tried to convince jurors that they did not need to know 
who the killer was wolcoff was still part of the plan and 
therefore guilty he said 
it doesnt legally matter who pulled the trigger morton 
said in closing arguments dont let michael wolcoff get away 
with murder 
wolcoff knows too much about details morton said he 
knew how and why and who the killer was to be 
michael wolcoff was identified as the man dressed in black who 
drove up to the nipons condominium and visited the couple the 
night they died and both lawyers surmised that wolcoff was 
carrying a payoff of some kind to nipon 
tenbrook said he thought the killer arrived after wolcoff left 
but no witnesses explained what exactly happened that night and why 
tenbrook said he thinks it is unlikely that rubin now serving 
time in federal prison for labor racketeering will be tried for 
the killings 
who pulled the trigger tenbrook said i dont have the 
slightest idea

it and then one time it hits you between the eyes he said 
the memorial is the most popular in washington and attracts 
12000 to 15000 visitors a day 
authorities said complaints poured in monday after news reports 
of what they had thought was vandalism in may multiple scratches 
discovered on three of the memorials 140 panels prompted a similar 
outcry the previous scratches have yet to be repaired

jesse jackson promised today to endorse michael 
dukakis and to campaign enthusiastically in the fall election 
though he is still asking the democratic convention to nominate him 
for president tonight as a testament to the struggles of our 
fathers and mothers 
for 50 minutes tuesday night in a valedictory for his own 
campaign jackson praised dukakis in careful phrases and appealed 
to both jackson and dukakis supporters to find common ground 
we meet tonight at a crossroads a point of decision shall we 
expand be inclusive find unity and power or suffer division and 
impotence he asked the delegates then answered his own 
question the only time we win is when we come together 
today jackson finally answered without equivocation the 
question that had tormented the party since it became clear that 
dukakis would win the roll call tonight is jackson going to 
endorse the dukakisbentsen ticket and campaign enthusiastically 
for it 
oh yes i am jackson said on abctv but in some sense 
the relationship i will have with the campaign must be defined by 
governor dukakis this is true for mario cuomo this is true for 
ted kennedy this is true for lane kirkland 
with the acknowledgement of dukakis wintocome but still 
without a formal endorsement jackson still appeared a little 
bitter that his pathbreaking efforts did not result in victory 
the fact is we are fighting a cultural crisis the fact is if 
any other candidate had campaigned as hard as i did campaigned 
against those odds and achieved as much that person no doubt would 
probably be the nominee or certainly on the ticket jackson said 
on nbctv 
and so it becomes my challenge just as fannie lou hamer had 
to keep knocking and pushing down doors through barriers and just 
as dr king had to do it im still doing it and im determined to 
push those doors down and i may i may not get through those doors 
but my children and your children will get through those doors and 
the white house is within reach i am pushing back barriers and 
removing ceilings off of dreams every day i see it as my 
obligation in a real sense now my mission 
he said after his speech tuesday night that he felt a great 
burden in writing it whether i was successful would determine 
whether we could pull this convention together he said 
jackson saluted dukakis for a wellmanaged and dignified 
campaign 
no matter how tired or how tried he always resisted the 
temptation to stoop to demagoguery jackson said 
he also emphasized the significance of his own presidential bid 
that won 7 million votes crossing lines of race economic stature 
and geography 
he was personal and emotional recalling at one point that in 
his own boyhood he ate no turkey on thanksgiving because momma 
was off cooking someone elses turkey 
his argument with dukakis is settled but he is going ahead in a 
contest for the nomination for the historical significance of the 
moment he came closer to winning the presidential nomination of a 
major party than any black person in history 
when you see jesse jackson when my name goes in nomination 
your name goes in nomination he said 
reciting familiar details of his humble beginnings jackson 
identified himself with the poor minorities and the underclass 
saying i know abandonment and people being mean to you and 
saying you are nothing and nobody and can never be anything i 
understand 
of dukakis he said i have watched a good mind fast at work 
with steel nerves guiding his campaign out of the crowded field 
without appeal to the worst of us i have watched his perspective 
grow as his environment has expanded ive seen his toughness and 
tenacity close up 
jacksons speech lacked some of the fire that he is capable of 
producing but it won plaudits from the dukakis campaign and 
observers including the partys 1984 nominee walter mondale 
at the end of the speech jackson seemed reluctant to leave the 
hall lingering for several minutes to take questions in a crush of 
reporters and cameras crammed at one side of the floor 
i was impressed beyond words said elaine flynn a dukakis 
delegate from oakridge nj i thought he gave everybody hope 
it was vintage jesse jesses valedictory address said 
another admiring dukakis delegatee florida floor whip clay 
henderson of daytona beach 
jackson was introduced by his five children and by a brief film 
highlighting his campaign and a sea of red jesse signs waved 
across the hall dukakis aides urged that the blue dukakis signs be 
kept down during the speech and some dukakis delegates gave up 
their seats to jackson alternates to give them a better view 
discussing dukakis jackson noted their dissimilar backgrounds 
his foreparents came to america in immigrant ships my 
foreparents came to america on slave ships but whatever the 
original ships we are both in the same boat tonight 
speaking of the slain civil rights leader who was his mentor 
jackson said dr martin luther kings heart would be full 
tonight 
jackson closed his speech with what has become a slogan for him 
and for his political efforts for the future keep hope alive 
he exhorted keep hope alive

gov buddy roemer has reversed himself 
and vetoed legislation restricting the display of bumper stickers 
deemed obscene 
one bill listed specific words and said they could not appear on 
bumper stickers in letters larger than oneeighth inch a second 
measure would have banned all words or pictures ruled obscene by 
the courts on bumper stickers 
roemer first said he liked the bills but killed them tuesday 
citing first amendment guarantees 
it is just unconstitutional the governor said it could 
cost us a ton of money to defend the laws in court 
the louisiana chapter of the american civil liberties union had 
said it would go to court if roemer signed either bill 
in his veto message roemer said the intent of this 
legislation is excellent and i fully agree with the concept of 
same i personally find such public display of the prohibited words 
extremely offensive 
but after consultation between my legal staff and 
representatives of the attorney generals office i have been 
advised that there is little chance that this statute will 
withstand constitutional scrutiny

the sheriff has been hearing a lot about 
the lizard man 7 feet tall with red eyes and three fingers on each 
hand but a state biologist says everybody would be better off 
looking for a red fox or a muddy drunk 
christopher davis 17 told sheriff liston truesdale he had been 
attacked several weeks ago by the creature in scape ore swamp as 
the teenager was changing a flat tire about 2 am 
the swamp was swamped tuesday with tv crews and other curious 
people hoping to catch a glimpse truesdale said he is getting 
other calls from people who said they saw the creature and these 
are reputable people 
were running down a whole lot of rumors but well cover what 
we can the sheriff said davis has agreed to undergo hypnosis to 
see if he can remember more 
truesdale called in biologist matt knox of the state wildlife 
and marine resources department after tom and mary waye reported 
their car had been chewed up last week 
the sheriff said he found tracks tuesday near the the couples 
house he said the tracks dont belong to a cow or deer but could 
be a bears 
knox said the tracks and short hairs he found on the chrome and 
molding of the car led him to conclude the animal was a red fox he 
said samples were sent to the university of georgia for analysis 
knox also interviewed davis 
as far as im concerned its no wild animal knowx said 
all i can guess is it was a man possibly a drunk who had been 
lying in the muddy ditch and got up when davis pulled over to 
change his tire 
from time to time we get sightings of bears or eastern 
cougars but bears arent green and they dont have red eyes 
the biologist said 
columbia radio station wcos has offered a 1 million reward for 
the capture of the lizard man 
some are taking it seriously and some are not midday 
announcer ron hicks said but he said if someone arrives at the 
station with the creature well probably all be eating a lot of 
lizard

by 1991 children infected by the aids virus may 
occupy as many as one in 10 of the nations pediatric hospital 
beds an aids researcher says 
the number of infected children could reach 10000 to 20000 by 
then and infected children might occupy one in 15 to one in 10 
pediatric beds james oleske said tuesday at a science writers 
conference sponsored by the american academy of pediatrics 
not all of them however would have fullblown acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome oleske said 
oleske said he believes that by 1991 any city with poor people 
and intravenous drug abuse can unfortunately expect to see 
pediatric aids developing 
the pediatric researcher at the university of medicine and 
dentistry of new jerseynew jersey medical school in newark nj 
said his predictions were based on experience caring for infected 
children in newark and on federal statistics 
the federal centers for disease control has counted 1065 cases 
of aids so far in children who were diagnosed while younger than 13 
cdc has no projections on how many children may become infected 
by 1991 but the atlantabased agency does expect a cumulative 
total of more than 3000 pediatric aids cases by that time a cdc 
spokeswoman said 
robert sweeney president of the national association of 
childrens hospitals and related institutions said pediatric aids 
cases may increase substantially 
it looks like it could pretty well double in this year he 
said in a telephone interview if they keep doubling they do 
tend to add up 
aids in children often results from an infected mother and 
oleske said maternalchild care centers should be established to 
care for the mother and child it is preposterous that a woman 
should have to take a crosstown bus to get care for herself 
after having her child seen by a pediatrician he said

for cocaine possession 
the 42yearold former prosecutor nicknamed mad dog for his 
flamboyant ways which included wearing a camouflage jacket and 
sidearm on drug raids was whisked past news cameras at the federal 
correctional institute shortly before 8 am 
warden jj clark said roark refused to sign consent forms 
allowing himself to be interviewed or permitting prison officials 
to discuss his incarceration 
the onetime assistant us attorney in pittsburgh and kanawha 
county wva prosecutor pleaded guilty to six counts of cocaine 
possession nov 17 and resigned as mayor nov 24 seven months 
after being elected to a second fouryear term 
in january he was sentenced to 179 days in prison and fined 
5000 roark entered prison feb 12 and was scheduled for release 
aug 8 federal authorities said he was released 18 days early 
because he was a model prisoner 
obviously hes presented no problems to us clark said 
adding that roark worked as a clerk in the prisons education 
department 
roark left prison in a convertible accompanied by a former aide 
ed esposito and a man prison officials identified as roarks 
brother 
roark once talked up as a republican gubernatorial candidate 
has said he no longer has a political future in west virginia he 
has said he wants to return to private practice if if he retains 
his law license 
his being a political candidate is about as absurd as electing 
me to the papacy said john charnock charleston city attorney 
and a close friend of roarks roark hopes to join charnocks law 
firm 
the state bar association is trying to revoke or suspend roarks 
license for breaching legal ethics by possessing and using cocaine 
he faces an aug 1 meeting with state bar investigators

last july roark was indicted on 27 cocainerelated counts and 
three obstruction counts he accepted a plea bargain 
twice divorced and a father of two roark led a highly visible 
nightlife in west virginias capital during his more than 4 years 
as mayor he was dogged by rumors of cocaine use which he 
vehemently denied until he pleaded guilty 
in an interview with the charleston daily mail published the day 
he entered prison he said i was stupid i was weak i had 
to face the cold hard facts of what i had done 
roark called his behavior as prosecutor hypocritical but 
denied his cocaine use affected his actions as prosecutor or mayor 
you know i was up at the top of the ladder and now im at 
the bottom of the ladder roark said in february as far as im 
concerned the political public life of mike roark is over

it finally became obvious that there are too many 
journalists at this democratic national convention when a horde of 
reporters this one included began interviewing people with 
boxes on their heads 
were just a bunch of guys standing around with boxes on their 
heads said one of the three men with cardboard boxes on their 
heads who identified himself as guy with a box on his head 
he and his two fellow people with boxes on their heads were just 
three of the well interesting folks hanging around the 
citys official demonstration zone actually a twoacre blacktop 
parking lot on tuesday during day 2 of the convention 
when asked where the people with boxes on their heads were 
based the guy with a box on his head replied here 
when asked what he stood for guy replied nothing 
and when asked why he had a box on his head he replied 
thats the name of our organization dammit 
but they dont like to be called boxheads because they 
consider it a racial slur guy said 
a cynic suspected he was actually a journalist who had been in 
the sun too long he wore a distinctive chain and plastic pouch 
around his neck used by journalists delegates and staff to carry 
credentials for the convention however where his credential 
should have been was the plastic card from his hotel door please 
make up room now 
later into the demonstration zone came pastor edgar mallett of 
the prayer amp faith church of the first born in chicago acclaimed 
at least on the sign he carried as the worlds greatest 
demonstrator for 16 years 
mallett 71 who campaigned for president in 1972 toting the 
weight of the world in a weighted sack over his shoulder said 
hes running again to save the country god told me were gonna 
lose it 
mallett believes that for america and the world to be saved we 
must have two presidents 
if we have a president from mars still we must have two 
thats my motto he said 
just outside the convention zone stood another minister street 
preacher dan martino of chattanooga tenn martino stood for hours 
in the hot sun at a corner near the convention center wearing a 
grey suit and black wing tips and holding the sign that got him a 
lot of attention god is a republican 
im here trying to help the democrats to think he said 
religion however took a beating from former connecticut state 
legislator thomas supina jr of ashford conn who stood on the 
sidewalk in front of the omni hotel next door to the arena 
distributing copies of a letter he has sent to us surgeon general 
c everett koop 
supina 82 is asking koop to declare that religion is an 
addictive drug and that living according to the preachings of 
most ministries could be dangerous to your health 
in his letter supina says tv preachers jimmy swaggart jim 
bakker oral roberts jerry falwell and pat robertson are 
disturbing the peace the tranquility and the well being of 
people everywhere 
later back inside the demonstration area poet deacon lunchbox 
of atlanta a big man with a long red beard and a small red cap 
took the stage with several leftwing poems of the day 
terrorism one was called its about libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi 
he likes to pray in the desert in his wraparound shades 
when he aint causing trouble he likes to have parades 
but neither the guy with a box on his head pastor mallett 
preacher martino the former connecticut legislator or the deacon 
of leftwing poetry attracted the media attention enjoyed by 
franklin burke of los angeles who has apparently become the 
official character of the 1988 democratic convention 
looking just a bit like a wayward uncle sam wearing 
redandblack checked slacks a us flag vest a dukakis sign and 
a dukakis hat burke has stood in the demonstration area each day 
since sunday he waves a us flag with a blue plastic bird tacked 
to the top and its wings if he jumps around enough really move 
bird he cries jumping up and down to make the wings work 
there it goes up in the air 
im here to have a good time meet the delegates see all the 
people join in the celebration he said 
he was certainly meeting a lot of journalists how many of the 
13000 covering the convention had he talked with by tuesday 
about 12000 he said

leaders of the medellin drug cartel in 1986 
offered us officials a deal under which they would halt drug 
trafficking and provide information on leftist guerrillas in 
colombia in exchange for amnesty from prosecution according to a 
published report today 
the proposal in the fall of 1986 never was taken seriously or 
pursued by the reagan administration the washington post reported 
citing laws enforcement sources and documents 
the newspaper said the deal was presented to an unidentified 
miami lawyer reported to the fbi and drug enforcement 
administration in miami and then relayed to senior administration 
officials in washington 
we dont do business with international outlaws said ann b 
wrobleski assistant secretary of state for international 
narcotics who acknowledged that she was familiar with the offer 
these people are the scum of the earth 
under the proposed deal top leaders of the medellin cartel 
offered to work for american intelligence and inform on 
guerrilla allies by supplying information on alleged libyan arms 
shipments and cuban personnel operating in colombia the newspaper 
said citing dea documents reports and sources 
the documents were obtained recently by a senate foreign 
relations subcommittee which has been holding hearings on 
international narcotics trafficking 
the dea documents said the miami lawyer attended two meetings in 
colombia with cartel leaders jorge ochoa pablo escobar and carlos 
lehder who has been convicted on drug charges in jacksonville fla 
lehder appeared to be under the impression that he escobar 
and ochoa can work for american intelligence by supplying 
information about guerrilla activities thereby incurring amnesty 
for their efforts the dea account said they then can return 
to their families and call an end to their trafficking activities 
lehder was captured three months after the meeting with the 
lawyer in a jungle shootout

sixyearold jb mcnickles had never been to 
camp before so when the bus showed up he decided to take advantage 
of the opportunity 
the bus drove off to malibu and dropped jb at a salvation army 
summer camp where he was assigned to a bunk and spent five days 
hiking swimming and sitting round the campfire 
what he didnt do was tell his foster parents where he was going 
they spent five frantic days as police distributed pictures of 
their missing child and organized doortodoor searches until jb 
reappeared on the doorstep monday 
when i came back my mommy almost had a heart attack jb 
reported tuesday almost all the people in the city were looking 
for me they was glad that i came home 
we thought something had happened said his foster mother 
63yearold edna williams i thought he might have gotten picked 
up or he might have hurt himself somewhere 
how much they spent looking for me asked jb a hundred 
thousand dollars maybe 
police detective nancy lyon who investigated the disappearance 
didnt sound so amused these various agencies need to be alerted 
that their checks and balances didnt work and they got outsmarted 
by a 6yearold she said 
so how did said 6yearold slip into camp and spend five days 
there unnoticed 
simple said jb 
odell williams his foster father dropped him off at the boys 
and girls club of san fernando valley where he was supposed to be 
spending a few hours at an athletic program jb noticed some kids 
getting into a van 
i never had been to camp before jb explained i wanted 
to see what it was like 
jb said he just got in and went to the back of the bus 
maj joe noland of the salvation army said jb had a bag of 
clothes with him and apparently stood in for a child who was signed 
up but didnt show 
when the bus returned someone recognized jb and brought him 
home jb was unimpressed by his adventure 
the malibu scenery he said was junky just some mountains 
and camp food 
i hated it i didnt eat any of it i didnt even touch it

olympic games in seoul officials said today

korean counterpart yang hyong sop was handed to north korean 
representatives at the panmunjom truce site on monday

accept several south korean government proposals on easing tension 
during the past few weeks 
unification board officials said they did not know why the north

the south korean opposition and the north might be more willing to 
deal with the assembly than the administration

unless it is allowed to be a cohost olympic authorities have 
rejected the norths demand

six former narcotics officers extorted at 
least 400000 plus cocaine from drug dealers prosecutors charged 
in another indictment in a 10yearold federal probe of 
philadelphia corruption 
police commissioner willie williams called the indictments 
announced tuesday at a news conference another sad day for the 
police department 
since 1976 some 40 philadelphia police officers have been 
convicted mostly for protecting illegal gambling 
in addition four judges have been found guilty of extortion 
convicted of taking cash from a roofers union local whose 13 top 
officials dispensed bribes to them and at least 10 other jurists 
also removed from the bench 
fbi agents tuesday said six narcotics officers were part of a 
racketeering conspiracy that involved extortion of money and drugs 
a seventh narcotics officer and two civilians were charged with 
lesser drug and tax violations 
some of the officers were accused of dealing cocaine and 
methamphetamine seized from drug suspects 
for a police officer to use his or her position to steal money 
is bad enough but for police officers to take money or other 
property in exchange for allowing drug dealers to continue to deal 
drugs or for the officers to take and to distribute drugs 
themselves that makes other forms of official corruption pale in 
comparison said acting us attorney thomas lee ii 
six of the officers named are no longer members of 
philadelphias 7000member department williams said the seventh 
officer was suspended and will be dismissed 
one indicted officer former lt john wilson appeared suddenly 
at the news conference to protest his innocence before the tv 
cameras he was roughly evicted 
outside wilson and former squad member james cattalo also 
indicted criticized the charges they are false they are 
exaggerated cattalo said no money was stolen no drugs were 
stolen everything was done properly 
the indictment alleges the scheme occurred from 1980 to 1984 and 
involved members of the departments elite five squad the squad 
has been disbanded

lion serpent sun was indeed a 
satanist but was not involved in any human sacrifice attempt a 
jury decided in awarding him 10000 in a libel suit 
the british columbia supreme court jury ruled tuesday that sun 
was libeled when len olsen in a 1984 appearance on the 
torontobased tv show 100 huntley street claimed he and his 
wife barely escaped death in a satanic ritual 
sun a 39yearold welfare recipient with selfproclaimed status 
as bishop in the holy catholic gnostic ekklesia was awarded 
10000 canadian 8300 us in damages and court costs from 
olsen the tv show and an evangelist who appeared with olsen 
i do feel that the award should have been a little bit 
higher said sun who was wearing a brown clerics collar 
i do resent being called a satanist in the sense that its 
been explained in so many ways as being such a negative thing he 
said i dont like being called a satanist i find that 
difficult 
olsen now a pentecostal preacher who runs a vancouver clinic 
for troubled teenagers said he and his wife were considering an 
appeal 
we feel somewhat vindicated in that it was said by the jury 
that the group was satanist said olsen flanked by his wife 
sheila 
geoff cowper counsel for 100 huntley street said he would 
make his recommendation on an appeal within a few weeks 
during six weeks of testimony the jury heard one lurid tale 
after another of nude ritual meetings drugs satanic practices and 
witchcraft in suns nowdefunct diddling metaphysical bookstore 
what the jury had to decide was what happened the night of oct 
14 1972 
witnesses for sun said the only thing out of the ordinary was 
olsens behavior following the consecration of some ceremonial 
knives 
one of the high priests gary gagecole testifed that 
olsens chanting suddenly went off key olsen became wildeyed

him and then bringing a statue of christ decorated with angels and 
demons into the ritual circle

sun gagecole and two others drew their ceremonial knives and held

a federal bankruptcy judge has ruled that 
ptl should be repaid nearly 200000 of the 363700 it spent to 
buy the silence of jessica hahn whose sexual encounter with jim 
bakker led to his downfall 
us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds said ptl is owed 160000 
in principal and interest from a 150000 trust fund the 
evangelical empire set up for the former church secretary in 1985 
in return for her promise not to talk about the liaison 
los angeles lawyer scott furstman already has agreed to return 
39000 of a 50000 retainer ptl paid him to administer the trust 
fund 
reynolds entered the judgment on tuesday against ms hahn and 
furstman 
reynolds ruling came the same day that ptl bankruptcy trustee 
mc red benton said contributions have declined drastically 
in the past four weeks ptl has received an average of 32000 a 
day in donations or 47 percent of contributions for the same 
period a year ago benton said 
in an effort to keep ptls religious broadcasting going until 
the heritage usa christian theme park is sold a new entity called 
heritage ministries will begin july 29 it will pay ptl 242000 a 
month for broadcast time on the ptl satellite network and for rent 
on ptls studios and church buildings 
ptl sued ms hahn and furstman for the hush money in april 
claiming ms hahn broke her agreement with ptl by talking about her 
1980 encounter with bakker at a hotel in clearwater beach fla 
ms hahn last year sold her story illustrated with seminude 
photos of herself to playboy for a reported 1 million 
ms hahn who recently moved out of the playboy mansion in los 
angeles and lives in a hotel there never replied to the suit she 
and paul roper her representative in the 1985 transaction have 
said they did not realize the money was ptls rather than bakkers 
personal money and that they felt guilty about taking it 
furstman was hired by ptl in 1985 to help in dealings with ms 
hahn 
the hahn transaction as well as other of bakkers financial 
dealings at ptl are the subject of a federal grand jury 
investigation into possible tax fraud 
an irs report filed in bankruptcy court in december said ptls 
payments in the hahn incident included the 150000 trust fund a 
115000 payment to roper who gave 20000 to ms hahn 85000 in 
legal fees to furstman and 10000 paid to ms hahn in 1984 for 
her signature on a statement absolving bakker of wrongdoing 
ms hahn received monthly interest from the trust fund from 1985 
until ptl stopped the payments in 1987 her tax returns indicate 
she received 10000 in 1985 under the judges orders she does 
not have to repay that money

iran said it would respect an immediate 
truce in the eightyear persian gulf war but iraq accused tehran 
of a twofaced ploy to win time for surprise attacks and said 
it would fight on 
even so secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar was making 
progress in talks with iran and iraqs un envoys in his quest to 
negotiate a ceasefire in a week to 10 days britains un 
ambassador sir crispen tickell said tuesday he did not elaborate 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said today that accepting the 
resolution was worse than drinking poison but that irans 
political leaders recommended it be done 
he said the decision was not a tactic to allow iran to regroup 
its forces but it should not be viewed as an end to the conflict 
either 
on tuesday night the security council called upon iran and iraq 
to exercise maximum restraint in order to facilitate the efforts 
of the secretarygeneral toward the implementation of resolution 
598 
the council members issued the call after holding private 
consultations on the ceasefire plan and on americas downing of an 
iranian jetliner on july 3 killing 290 civilians aboard 
khomeini said he could not immediately answer those asking him 
why he changed his mind after saying for years that iran would 
fight until the last drop of blood his remarks were carried by 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia 
iran on monday declared after a years delay that it 
unconditionally accepts the security council resolution which 
demands an immediate truce and troop withdrawal and sets out a 
peace plan to end the war 
iraq said last year it would accept the resolution but on 
tuesday it raided a nuclear power plant and other iranian 
industrial targets iran accused the baghdad government of 
sabotaging peace efforts 
perez de cuellars spokesman francois giuliani said the 
secretarygeneral believes the continuation of hostilities is a 
clear sign that the ceasefire must come into place as soon as 
possible 
the peruvian met separately tuesday with iraqs ambassador 
ismat t kittani and iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati 
in a letter mahallati urged the security council to condemn 
tuesdays iraqi attacks saying the action defiantly mocks all 
efforts for attainment of a peaceful end to the conflict 
he said he told the un chief that in the view of the 
authorities of iran the secretarygeneral has a totally free 
hand to declare dday at this very moment which means starting 
implementation of resolution 598 
dday is the day on which a ceasefire would begin it would be 
set by the secretarygeneral after consultations with both sides 
but foreign minister tariq aziz of iraq speaking in baghdad 
called irans decision to accept the resolution twofaced and 
aimed at winning time to launch surprise offensives in the war 
we will consider the war to be still going on until the actual 
application of the ceasefire according to an agreedupon plan 
he said we have to make sure the iranians really want a 
comprehensive and lasting peace 
he said that until iran takes tangible steps toward peace and 
demonstrates its sincerity it is logical to act as if the war is 
still going on 
a senior middle east diplomat speaking on condition of 
anonymity said iraq is not interested in a simple ceasefire 
iraq is interested in a comprehensive settlement and iran must 
specifically state and prove its willingness for more than a 
truce 
since april iraq has scored a series of battlefield victories 
that have regained just about all the territory iran captured from 
it since 1982

the government said today it has 
identified the ringleader of a massacre aboard a greek cruise ship 
and it linked him to a slaying claimed by the abu nidal terrorist 
group 
public order minister anastasios sehiotis said the leader was 
hejab jaballa who holds a libyan passport sehiotis said jaballa 
was involved in the slaying of an egyptian newspaper editor 10 
years ago in nicosia cyprus which was claimed by abu nidal 
he said three accomplices to the ship attack also were 
identified sehiotis identified them as aboul amoud adnan sojod 
and merhi mehieddine 
terrorists fired guns and threw grenades aboard the ship the 
city of poros in the aegean sea on july 11 nine people were 
killed and at least 98 were wounded 
police matched fingerprints found in an athens apartment rented 
by jaballa with those uncovered in 1978 in cyprus and found they 
belonged to the same person sehiotis said 
abu nidal whose real name is sabri albanna gets much of his 
funding from libyan leader moammar gadhafi and maintains 
headquarters in tripoli us officials have said abu nidal 
probably conducted the ship attack 
sehiotis who read a long statement to journalists refused to 
say whether jaballa and his alleged accomplices were dead or had 
fled the country 
sehiotis said police speculated that at least one of the gunmen 
may have been killed by an explosion that rocked the ships bridge 
no positive identification of two bodies has been made 
hours before the attack two men believed to be arabs died in a 
car explosion near a marina where the city of poros was scheduled 
to dock their car contained automatic weapons and explosives 
officials released photographs of three arab suspects they said 
the photographs were found in forged passports and at the site of 
the explosion of the car the officials identified only two of the 
men in the photographs jaballa and mehieddine but were unable 
to name the third man 
police said they believe the occupants of the car were waiting 
for the cruise liner to arrive at the marina and planned to hijack 
it 
sehiotis said jaballa arrived in greece by air from copenhagen 
on june 1 he was preceded by his three accomplices who arrived in 
athens early in may from belgrade after starting out from beirut 
sehiotis said 
all the evidence indicates that jaballa played the leading 
role in the terrorist operation since he had all the details of 
members of his group in his possession sehiotis said 
police said that during their investigation they found forged 
passports belonging to the suspects 
greek officials were reluctant to say whatarab group could 
possibly be behind the massacre aboard the ship but cia director 
william webster in washington reportedly said last week that the 
terrorist attack appeared to be the work of the abu nidal group 
merchant marine minister evangelos yannopoulos outlined new 
security measures in effect at the countrys major ports and aboard 
cruise liners 
he said that five to 10 commandos would be assigned to each 
cruise ship and would be responsible for neutralizing terrorist 
attempts to take over a vessel 
passengers at the port of piraeus near athens reported they 
underwent a body search and their luggage was photographed by xray 
equipment before boarding a ship for a cruise last weekend

the new president of the teamsters disputed the 
justice departments contention that the union leadership is 
controlled by the mafia and said he himself is clean 
i can tell you i hope to get cancer of the tongue i dont 
know any of these guys said william j mccarthy of the reputed 
organized crime figures named in the governments lawsuit to take 
control of the 16 millionmember union 
mccarthys remarks appeared in todays boston globe in the first 
interview he has given since he upset weldon mathis last week to 
succeed jackie presser as president of the nations biggest union 
mathis is the unions secretarytreasurer and was pressers 
handpicked successor mccarthy 69 said he challenged mathis 
because of growing disagreements over contract talks political 
endorsements and other issues 
things have got to be changed around completely said 
mccarthy who had been head of the teamsters in new england 
mccarthy told the globe that he had disagreed with mathis and 
presser who died july 9 over a new contract affecting 200000 
drivers nationwide 
the contract which calls for pay increases of 22 percent per 
year for the next three years was rejected by 64 percent of union 
members but still went into effect because of a provision requiring 
a twothirds no vote to kill a contract

argued with presser about it 
he also said he had disagreed with pressers plans to have the 
union endorse gov michael s dukakis for president immediately

growth in personal income slowed in most 
states during the first three months of 1988 with the timing of 
farm subsidy payments depressing income in the corngrowing states 
of nebraska and iowa and boosting income in the wheatgrowing 
states of montana north dakota and oklahoma the government said 
today 
the commerce department said growth in the 50 states slowed to 
08 percent in the januarymarch period compared with growth of 
28 percent in the final quarter of 1987 income dropped in six 
states edged up in 42 and showed no growth in two 
in all but three states oklahoma idaho and montana income 
either fell or its growth slowed from the fourth quarter 
residents of montana saw their incomes shoot up by 6 percent 
over the last three months of 1987 the biggest increase of any 
state income in north dakota jumped 41 percent while income in 
oklahoma rose 24 percent 
all three increases were attributed to advance subsidy payments 
on the 1988 wheat and barley crops 
nebraska had the biggest decline 60 percent followed by iowa 
42 percent and south dakota 26 percent incomes fell there in 
the januarymarch period following large fourthquarter corn 
subsidy payments 
other states suffering declines or no growth were minnesota 
down 08 percent colorado down 04 percent and texas and utah 
both with no change 
the report noted that the effects of subsidy payments can vary 
substantially from state to state and quarter to quarter because 
the assistance is not paid out evenly over the year and each 
eligible crop is under a different subsidy program 
excluding farm income nevada showed the strongest growth 2 
percent followed by vermont and virginia 17 percent each 
alaska the only state where incomes declined slipped 10 
percent excluding farm income oklahoma showed no growth while 
texas and colorado edged up only 01 percent weak oil prices were 
blamed for the poor performance of incomes in those states which 
are heavily dependent on oil drilling and mining 
overall personal income excluding farm payments rose 10 
percent in the 50 states 
the report also noted profit sharing and bonus payments by auto 
companies boosted income in michigan which had a 09 percent rise 
and ohio where income advanced 10 percent

britain today celebrated the 300th anniversary of 
the bloodless glorious revolution that established its democracy 
and brought to the throne william and mary who founded the royally 
chartered american college 
about 1500 people filled the palace of westminster seat of the 
british parliament for a ceremony celebrating the worlds most 
enduring constitutional monarchy 
among the guests were a us delegation from the college of 
william and mary in virginia led by former chief justice warren e 
burger 
they were joined by queen elizabeth ii prime minister margaret 
thatcher prince william of orange heir to the dutch throne a 
dutch parliamentary delegation and speakers of many of the 
parliaments of commonwealth countries 
the ceremony recalled the 17th century abdication of king james 
ii the last of englands absolute monarchs and the arrival from 
the netherlands of william and mary who were enthroned as 
constitutional monarchs ruling under parliament 
william invited by dissident noblemen to replace james sailed 
to england with 300 ships and 15000 soldiers 
the glorious revolution and the bill of rights that followed in 
1689 transformed the relationship between the crown and 
parliament they secured our liberties said bernard weatherill 
speaker of the house of commons in his address 
queen elizabeth in her address said williams accession to the 
throne with mary ended almost a century of constitutional turmoil 
and uncertainty in the two kingdoms of england and scotland 
it meant the queen said that the successive swings between 
the arbitrary rule of the king and arbitrary rule of parliament 
became intolerable 
some historians argue that the glorious revolution entrenched 
the rule of the british upper classes and led to the repression of 
catholics under protestant williams reign 
paul r verkuil president of the college of william and mary 
said in an interview that the controversy has not been exported 
to the united states 
for us the glorious revolution is pure and simple the 
precursor of our own revolution it is truly an important event for 
us he said 
the college whose chancellor is burger was founded in 1693 at 
the behest of william and mary congress with president reagans 
assent designated it to represent the united states at todays 
ceremony

democratic party chairman paul kirk facing 
complaints from delegates who couldnt get in to see jesse jackson 
said today that they knew the size of the hall and that they should 
stay in the building during convention sessions to keep the same 
thing from happening again 
this is not a superdome kir said for all intents and 
purposes its a live tv studio 
kirks comments came after as many as 1000 unhappy people some 
of them delegates were left outside the omni tuesday night because 
party leaders had the buildings entrances sealed off before 
jacksons late speech at the fire marshals suggestion 
to avoid a repeat situation kirk suggested delegates remain in 
the building after the gavel sounds to open the convention each day 
on tuesday police gazed across their barricades at a shouting 
throng of credentialwaving delegates guests and reporters who 
were left standing in the warm night breeze 
jacksons speech could be seen on large televisions set up in a 
cavernous exhibition hall across the street but those who were 
stuck outside didnt pay their way to atlanta to watch tv 
i would rather die said richard koster who traveled from 
panama as part of the democrats abroad delegation why dont you 
watch your wedding night on tv 
it was not unexpected that we would have problems with the 
hall said party spokesman mike mccurry 
the same thing happened at least three times in 1984 when 
democrats held their convention in the 15000seat moscone center 
hall in san francisco mccurry said 
so why did the party four years later decide to meet in a hall 
that could seat only 11000 
im just not going to go into that right now he said 
thats ancient history and were here now 
kirk said the building wasnt too small the crowd was just too 
big people should have known kirk said obviously people 
had plenty of notice it has nothing to do with the size of the 
hall 
the great and the small alike found themselves unable to budge 
the police 
sen sam nunn dga was seen emerging from a crowd that was 
trying without success to gain entry when asked his thoughts about 
being barred from a building in his home state nunns reply was a 
stare followed by a no comment 
aides said later that nunn wasnt really trying to get back in 
the hall but was leaving so he could watch jackson on television 
a handful of relatives of michael dukakis the partys 
nomineetobe were detained for a few minutes by a skeptical 
policeman they eventually were allowed to pass 
delegates ran from one gate to the next in hopes that someone 
somewhere would let them in about three dozen of them eventually 
made it 
the rest elbowed their way through crowds yelling delegate 
delegate there were shouts of let me in and this is 
america buddy 
rep carol moseley braun assistant majority leader of the 
illinois general assembly said she was turned away from the omni 
and watched jacksons speech on television in the adjoining world 
congress center 
i was furious about not getting in particularly as a delegate 
from the state of illinois she said i though it was a denial 
of my right to participate in the process 
delegates did not miss any key votes but koster said they were 
denied the possibility to witness history 
he drew a connection to the convention in 1896 when a relatively 
unknown politician william jennings bryan delivered his famous 
cross of gold speech that propelled him instantly from 
obscurity to the democratic presidential nomination

an investigator testified today 
that mohammed ali hamadi charged in the hijacking of a twa jet 
admitted belong to a proiranian group linked to the holding of 
western hostages in lebanon 
the testimony of heinrich brandtjen a federal police 
investigator from west germany contradicted hamadis statements 
last week that he was not a member of the radical hezbollah group 
brandtjens testimony came after hamadi charged with murder and 
air piracy in the hijacking that left an american navy diver dead 
declared that he hates the united states 
a prosecution witness who said she met hamadi in west germany 
the month before the june 1985 hijacking broke into tears and said 
someone threatened her to keep her from saying she recognized the 
defendant 
after his older brother abbas refused to testify at the start 
of todays proceedings hamadi read from a statement he started 
tuesday 
chief judge heiner mueckenberger interrupted him asking do 
you hate the usa 
i grew up in lebanon in the middle of the war and one 
naturally asks himself why the answer was always america or 
israel with support of america the shiite moslem responded 
again the chief judge asked him do you hate america 
i have hateful feelings for all that attacked us not just for 
the usa alone hamadi said through an interpreter 
i only hear america america america america kills america 
destroys he said 
the chief judge asked him do you find attacks and hijackings 
against the usa justified 
im not convinced that all forms of fighting are correct he 
cited an admonition in the koran islams holy book to fight 
those who fight you but dont attack those that dont attack you 
the jetliner was hijacked to beirut on a flight from athens to 
rome in june 1985 thirtynine americans were held captive for 17 
days and us navy diver robert stetham was killed 
brandtjen said that hamadi admitted joining the radical 
hezbollah group after the twa incident one of hamadis brothers 
abdulhadi is hezbollahs security chief in beirut 
he told me he has belonged to hezbollah since the autumn of 
1985 or 1986 but i cannot remember exactly the year brandtjen 
said 
hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella group for proiranian 
groups holding 18 foreigners including nine americans hostage in 
lebanon 
earlier one of the judges asked witness helga marx if she 
recognized mohammed and she said she was unsure 
her testimony came as the court tried to establish hamadis 
movements and actions before the hijacking hamadi has given only 
vague accounts of where he was 
before the trial mrs marx told police she met hamadi and his 
brother abbas in the town of merzig at a party in an apartment 
building where she lived abbas hamadi was living in the same 
building 
the judge reminded her of what she had told police and asked 
would you answer this question differently if you had not been 
threatened 
she replied of course i would answer differently 
asked whether the threat was written or verbal mrs marx 
replied i have four children they said it would be better and 
healthier for me if i dont say anything 
there was no explanation of who made the threat 
mohammed hamadi then stood up and said could the person you 
saw have been taller stronger built and with different hair 
mrs marx replied no the person looked exactly like you 
the chief judge asked abbas hamadi whether he would testify 
about his brothers age a key issue in the trial or about 
explosives mohammed hamadi is charged with trying to smuggle into 
west germany 
his age determines whether he would be sentenced as a juvenile 
young adult or adult 
abbas hamadi refused both requests 
mohammed hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 
1987 trying to smuggle three bottles of liquid explosives into the 
country 
he has told the court that abbas hamadi managed to get through 
customs undetected although he also was carrying liquid 
explosives the brothers arrived in frankfurt together from beirut 
lebanon 
abbas hamadi 29 was arrested jan 26 1987 at frankfurt 
airport when he returned after the kidnappings of west germans 
rudolf cordes and alfred schmidt in beirut schmidt was freed in 
september but cordes remains a hostage 
he was convicted of masterminding the kidnappings in a bid to 
force his brothers release a duesseldorf court sentenced him to 
13 years in prison in april

a federal judge today denied a 
newspapers request that he unseal the affidavits that led to 
search warrants as part of the ongoing pentagon bribery 
investigation 
it seems to me that release of this information now would harm 
the process of the investigation said us district court judge 
claude a hilton as he explained his ruling 
hilton rejected a motion by the washington times that he should 
make public the affidavits that led to some of the search warrants 
that were served june 14 
the warrants were the public unveiling of the twoyearold 
investigation which centers on allegations that some defense 
contractors and private consultants paid bribes to defense 
department employees for details about contracts the information 
could be vital to winning multimillion dollar contracts 
jerome barron representing the newspaper argued that the 
massive publicity already sought by the government in the middle of 
june has put all defense contractors under a cloud the best way 
to clear the air is reveal what information the government has he 
said 
barron also argued that release of information could permit 
corrective action to be undertaken and he cited the july 1 
order of defense secretary frank carlucci who froze contracts in 
nine military programs 
carlucci said he was acting on the basis of information in 
affadavits which had been unsealed the day before in dallas but he 
later lifted the suspension because he said a review of the 
contracts had shown that none were tainted 
barron argued that there is tremendous public interest in the 
case and said the public should know the facts behind the search 
warrants 
but joseph aronica representing the us attorneys office 
opposed the motion and told hilton to release these papers at 
this point would impede this investigation without any doubt 
aronica said the investigation is in its early stages and 
release of the affidavits may lead to the destruction of 
property by people who could be targets 
the government plans to release the affidavits later aronica 
said but he said he didnt know when

the government has agreed to 
principles negotiated in new york to remove foreign troops from 
angola and grant independence to southwest africa the department 
of foreign affairs announced today 
the governments of angola cuba and the united states were 
expected to make similar announcements agreeing to a list of 14 
principles signed by negotiators from the four countries in peace 
talks last week 
the principles include acceptance of a withdrawal of cuban 
troops from angola and implementation of a un peace plan for 
southwest africa that includes south african withdrawal from the 
territory it rules 
a call for south african withdrawal of an estimated 3000 troops 
from angola was not specifically contained in the principles made 
public here 
the agreement reached in new york calls for an estimated 50000 
cuban troops to leave marxistruled angola and for south africa to 
end its 73year rule over southwest africa commonly known as 
namibia 
but no timetable has been set for the withdrawal of cuban troops 
or independence for namibia the main issues to be negotiated in 
future talks 
angola with help from its cuban allies has been fighting a 
civil war since it gained independence from portugal in 1975 
battling the prowestern rebels of unita or the national union for 
the total independence of angola 
the united states supplies military aid to unita while south 
africa has several thousand troops in southern angola fighting 
alongside the rebels 
the united states and south africa are seeking a full cuban 
troop withdrawal over a oneyear period cuba and angola have 
talked of a fouryear period for the cuban pullback but they have 
indicated flexibility 
under a 1978 united nations resolution independence in namibia 
would be carried out over a oneyear time frame once south africa 
consents to that step 
but south africa with us backing has said the south african 
withdrawal will not take place unless cuba agrees to withdraw its 
forces simultaneously 
sparsely populated namibia is between south africa and angola 
south africa has ruled namibia since world war i under a league of 
nations mandate the leagues successor the united nations 
revoked that mandate 
the four parties involved in the talks began their meetings in 
london in may the next round is tentatively scheduled for august

the government today expelled a prominent armenian 
activist and stripped him of his soviet citizenship as punishment 
for stirring up nationalist sentiment in an ethnic dispute the 
tass news agency said 
tass did not say where the activist paruyr ayrikyan 39 was 
headed or whether he left the soviet union 
the expulsion came two days after the soviet leadership gave a 
final ruling in the heated and sometimes violent struggle between 
armenians and azerbaijanis over control of the small 
nagornokarabakh region in the caucasus mountains 
the decision by the presidium of the supreme soviet to reject 
armenias bid to annex the region appeared today on the front pages 
of national newspapers 
tass also said that ayrikyan was pardoned but it did not say 
what he was pardoned for he was arrested last march on charges of 
defaming the soviet state but it is not known whether he was 
convicted 
susana avakyan his girlfriend and fellow member of the 
underground group alliance for national selfdetermination said in 
a telephone interview that authorities have been trying for months 
to get ayrikyan to agree to expulsion but that he refused 
he said that if you hear that i agreed its a provocation i 
wont agree said avakyan 39 
ayrikyan relayed the message to two of his sisters who visited 
him in prison in late june avakyan said 
on tuesday night staterun television showed a debate in the 
presidium during which mikhail s gorbachev chastised nationalists 
in azerbaijan and armenia for stirring up tensions in the dispute 
hundreds of armenians tried to gather at red square on tuesday 
night to protest the decision of the presidium the nations 
nominal parliament to reject the annexation said an armenian 
activist in moscow leon sudzhyan he said police roughed them up 
and took them away to police stations 
residents of the armenian capital of yerevan were said to be 
despondent but relatively calm earlier today before ayrikyans 
expulsion was reported 
the nationalist helped organize the armenian drive to have 
nagornokarabakh removed from azerbaijans control and annexed to 
the armenian republic he also provided frequent reports to foreign 
correspondents in moscow on the mass demonstrations and strikes 
staged in support of the annexation effort 
from youth he has been involved in fanning up nationalist 
animosity tass said of ayrikyan who has spent 17 years in labor 
camps and in exile for his activity 
tass said the former criminalcreated a crisis situation in 
armenia and nagornokarabakh and it accused him of giving 
information to moscowbased correspondents that was based on 
imagination ayrikyan was arrested march 25 and charged with 
defaming the soviet state 
armenians are predominantly christian and the nagornokarabakh 
region was part of armenia until 1923 armenians make up 
threequarters of the 160000 people of the contested region and 
they claim that azerbaijanis who are mostly moslem are 
discriminating against them 
strikes and demonstrations have been common in nagornokarabakh 
and the armenian capital of yerevan since february when the 
disputed regions initial appeal for transfer to armenia was 
denied on feb 28 rioting in the azerbaijani city of sumgait left 
32 people dead 26 of them armenians 
repeated telephone calls to nagornokarabakh failed to go 
through today 
the presidium heeding gorbachevs call said during an 
extraordinary eighthour session on monday that the constitution 
makes the annexation of the region by armenia impossible 
during the highlights of the session broacast tuesday night 
nagornokarabakh leader genrikh pogosyan made an impassioned speech 
saying the only correct decision was to return the territory to 
armenia 
but dozens of other speakers contended azerbaijan was within its 
rights in vetoing the annexation bid and called for maintaining the 
status quo 
gorbachev urged armenians and azerbaijanis to accept the 
existing reality of the republics location and struck out at 
what he called constant tests of his reforms by groups with selfish 
interests at heart 
many of the armenian activists who had been pressing for 
annexation have cast the question as a test of the sincerity of 
gorbachevs campaigns to give soviets more say in governmental 
affairs

the reagan administration today welcomed as a 
positive step a soviet offer to dismantle a disputed radar 
complex in krasnoyarsk but said there should be no strings 
attached to the proposal 
it should be unconditional said a us official who 
described the offer as a step forward in discussions with the 
soviets over the siberian facility 
so far however the soviets have not proposed a date for a 
joint review with the united states of the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty which imposes constraints on radar and other 
defenses against rocket attack 
the offer to dismantle krasnoyarsks phased array radar was 
coupled in moscow on tuesday with a proposal that the united states 
promise to adhere to the pact 
if an understanding to abide by the abm treaty as signed in 
1972 is reached the soviet union will be ready to dismantle the 
krasnoyarsk redar in a verifiable way that would leave no doubts on 
the part of the united states viktor p karpov the soviet 
foreign ministrys top arms control specialist said 
the us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
president reagan had not decided whether to accuse the soviets of a 
material breach of the treaty at krasnoyarsk a step that could 
clear the way for the united states to expand its star war 
tests 
the head of the arms control agency wants reagan to level the 
charge against moscow while the joint chiefs of staff have urged 
him to hold to the 1972 pact 
the odd lineup reflects a deep and peculiar division within the 
administration as reagan awaits a response from moscow on when to 
review the treaty considered a cornerstone of the arms control 
process 
reagan has already labeled the krasnoyarsk radar a violation of 
the 1972 treaty in two reports to congress while the soviets deny 
any infraction even many liberal critics of the administrations 
arm control policy question the legality of the facility 
the joint chiefs recommended that reagan not charge the soviets 
with a material breach because that could lead to an unraveling 
of the treaty the us official told the associated press the 
chiefs are convinced if that happens the soviets are in a better 
position to take advantage of a breakout the official said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
this puts the chiefs at odds with arms control director william 
f burns jr who takes a harder stance on the treaty than the 
military but burns would give the soviets time to level the 
facilities before the united states retaliated 
the official said that even if reagan accepted the advice of 
burns and other hardline advisers it did not mean he would 
scuttle the treaty which limits us and soviet defenses against 
ballistic missiles 
it would mean we have a right to do something restricted by 
the treaty the official said it doesnt mean we are going to 
throw the treaty out the window 
in the meantime the treaty is due for its fiveyear review and 
the united states had proposed to the soviets that the review begin 
last friday in geneva

rep mario biaggi is a thug in a congressmans 
suit a prosecutor said in closing arguments today at the 
4monthold wedtech corp corruption trial 
assistant us attorney edward j little told the jury that the 
10term bronx democrat had extorted cash and stock from the 
nowdefunct defense contractor through the power of his office 
he wasnt a thug with a gun hes a thug in a congressmans 
suit little said 
biaggi 70 his eldest son richard and five others are charged 
with turning wedtech into a racketeering enterprise that paid out 
millions of dollars in bribes to obtain nobid defense contracts 
the defense has maintained that four corrupt wedtech executives 
who testified for the government in exchange for leniency had 
links to white house insiders like attorney general edwin meese iii 
and did not need help 
us district judge constance baker motley denied a defense 
request to call meese as a witness saying his actions had nothing 
to do with the guilt or innocence of those on trial meese has not 
been charged with any wrongdoing 
the final witness in the trial tuesday was toni patricia biaggi 
richard biaggis wife she was called by the defense for her 
supposed familiarity with her husbands dealings 
during crossexamination by prosecutors however she admitted 
that she was unaware of the existence of two companies in which her 
husband owned 50 percent of the shares and served as director 
prosecutors said the companies four star military marketing 
corp and the five star realty corp were vehicles through which 
the younger biaggi was paid kickbacks from military contractors 
doing business with wedtech 
mrs biaggi also said her husband never told her anything about 
martin marietta corp earlier in the trial a former director of 
operation at martin marietta john w paxton said the congressman 
telephoned him at least two maybe three or four times to urge 
the company to select wedtech as a subcontractor 
all of the defendants except biaggi his son and bernard 
ehrlich the congressmans former law partner took the witness 
stand during the trial which began march 11 
biaggi had intended to take the stand himself until motley gave 
prosecutors wide latitude to crossexamine the congressman about 
his past including his conviction in an unrelated case on charges 
of accepting an illegal gratuity

the albuquerque nm tribune on iran accepting cease fire 
resolution 
iran shocked and surprised the diplomatic world monday by 
announcing that it accepted a yearold un security council 
resolution calling for a cease fire in its bloody eightyear war 
with neighboring iraq 
with its fingers crossed against disappointment the reagan 
administration called the step a major breakthrough toward 
peace 
with grim suspicion iraq saw a tactical move by the 
devious iranian regime 
whichever view proves correct tehrans statement still must be 
welcomed it was the first time it had talked about an 
unconditional truce 
iraq may be making the diplomatic error of refusing to take yes 
for an answer it should enter unmediated negotiations with iran 
to see where they lead

the seattle times on the mexican election 
in 1846 the united states stole half of mexico and this 
country has never felt obliged to pay much attention since 
mexicos presidential election may change that 
after 60 years of popular allegiance the ruling institutional 
revolutionary party held on to power by a whisker carlos salinas 
de gortari won the presidency by a humbling 5036 percent of the 
vote his predecessors never received less than 70 percent 
democracy is messy and the proof will come in the 
protestfilled streets of mexican cities minority parties on both 
the left and right believe salinas narrow win is as much of a 
fraud as his partys string of victories since 1929 
over the years the united states has lectured and wagged a 
finger at mexico about drugs pollution central american politics 
and immigration 
mexico is still smarting over what it considers the unwarranted 
condemnation of its drugenforcement efforts by congress 
as new angry voices gain ascendancy in mexico washington may 
have to listen for a change

anchorage alaska daily news on george bush at the united 
nations 
a few days back vice president george bush said that he 
couldnt wait to tell the united nations the us view of the july 
3 iranian airliner tragedy 
but now that hes had his say its clear bushs narrow view of 
events wasnt worth the buildup 
bush couldnt resist a recitation of this countrys right to 
sail the persian gulf and a detailed review of irans many sins in 
its 8yearold war with iraq 
clearly the united states does have a right to use the gulf 
clearly irans radical government has conducted a bloody war 
against iraq that frequently has been characterized by outright 
barbarism 
but bushs account of the war was distorted iraq is as much 
to blame for the war as iran if the iranians have attacked neutral 
ships so have the iraquis if iranians repeatedly have shown 
contempt for the united states so have the iraquis 
bush spent his visit to the un talking at the iranian 
delegation and the television cameras that might be great for 
his campaign against democrat michael dukakis but it didnt do 
anything to improve our relations with iran or bring peace to the 
persian gulf

somehow earned first refusal of the vice presidential nomination

san antonio texas expressnews on the cost efficiency of 
prisons 
tough prison sentences for hardened criminals serve the cause of 
justice but some fear that they cost more than taxpayers can 
afford 
a recent justice department study has some reassuring news 
keeping repeat offenders behind bars actually is cheaper than 
granting them early release 
the departments research arm the national institute of 
justice found that the average prisoner costs 25000 a year 
including prison construction and maintenance expenses 
but crimes committed by repeat offenders who have been freed 
early cost about 430000 a year in losses to victims and in 
outlays for police courts etc 
it is true that many prisons are overcrowded the remedy is not 
to turn their inmates loose but to build more prisons

the financial times conservative 
the democratic party for the first time in more than a 
quarter of a century has begun to present a united front to the 
american electorate this gives it a chance although not a 
guarantee of victory in the presidential election much of the 
credit for creating the partys newfound sense of unity must go to 
the democratic candidate mr michael dukakis whose own reputation 
is that of being slightly to the left of center in american terms 
a cautious liberal on domestic issues and a more or less unknown 
quantity on foreign policy 
dukakis reached an understanding with the powerful mr 
jackson 
this understanding could however eventually damage the 
partys chances of victory the package of policies that he has 
pushed for is too far to the left for a party that seeks victory

an identity crisis common to many progressive parties in the 
west like the british laborites and the german social democrats 
that have suffered in these years the offensive of neoconservative 
forces 
the us democrats dont want to be cast in obsolete 
positions they are aiming to recover the center of the electorate 
and activate the enthusiasm of their traditional base 
la stampa moderate 
governing from the center is the message that the possible 
protagonists of the third chapter of the american political scene 
seem to want to present in atlanta certain that the public will 
join around this flag 
it is a possible project but not an easy one it is thus that 
the atlanta convention appears so unheroic so difficult to 
relate to as a great event yet if it does not go badly if there 
will not be the drama of a tragic separation between white and 
black a new definition of making politics could start here in

here is the text of an iraqi letter from 
foreign minister tariq aziz sent wednesday to secretarygeneral 
perez de cuellar the unofficial englishlanguage text was provided 
by the iraqi mission and iraqi news agency 
your excellency 
i have the honor to refer to the recent development in the 
situation after tehran informed the un of its acceptance of 
resolution 598 
we need to move from the stage of generalities to the practical 
stage in which we could test the iranian position whether it is 
serious or tactical or which has partial or temporary solutions 
instead of reaching comprehensive and lasting solutions stemming 
out of our deep commitment to our responsibility toward reaching a 
comprehensive and lasting peace as soon as possible 
we suggest to your excellency and to iran the following 
practical steps 
motivated by a deep feeling of responsibility towards reaching a 
comprehensive and lasting peace as soon as possible iraq has 
proposed five practical steps to the united nations and iran 
1 holding of a meeting between authorized representatives from 
iraq and iran at the united nations headquarters to be followed by 
another meeting in baghdad and tehran later under the auspices of 
the un secretarygeneral or his representative to begin formal 
and direct talks on measures to enforce the un security council 
resolution no 598 in accordance with the sequence of its operative 
articles 
in case that a difference of viewpoints emerges on that it 
would be natural to resort to the un charter international law 
and the geneva agreement of 1949 on prisoners of war 
we call for a meeting to be held as soon as possible and our 
proposal to hold a meeting in baghdad or tehran besides the 
proposed meeting is aimed to create appropriate atmospheres for 
signing an agreement on comprehensive and lasting peace between the 
two countries 
2 in view of the importance of the shatt alarab issue which we 
had reaffirmed in our correspondence and talks with you mr perez 
de cuellar and the security council members and in our official 
statements we hereby request that you ask the specialized bodies 
at the united nations to immediately undertake the task of clearing 
the shatt alarab waterway for navigation in a manner which would 
enable the two countries to utilize it 
we also propose that these bodies should work out a specified 
timetable and provide the necessary possibilities to accomplish 
this task as soon as possible the two countries are also required 
to submit all assistance and facilities to these bodies in a 
constructive spirit in order to accomplish its task speedily 
3 iraqs full rights in free navigation in the arab gulf waters 
and the strait of hormuz should be guaranteed immediately 
4 while hoping to reach an understanding between the two sides 
to reach a speedy agreement for lasting and comprhehensive peace 
and good neighborlihood between the two countries as a basis for 
comprehensive peace inthe region it would be natural in case of 
partial or complete failure to reach this objective that you mr 
perez de cuellar and the un bodies undertake an active role in 
facilitating the task of direct formal talks and to provide 
viewpoints and advice which facilitate the task of the negotiations 
whenever that deemed necessary and the security council would 
remain having the effective role in accordance with its 
responsibilities under its charter to intervene in taking 
appropriate decisions whenever that deemed necessary 
5 iraq calls upon iran to refrain from intercepting or 
attacking ships and oil tankers operating in the territorial waters 
of the gulf states which are not part in the conflict and in the 
high seas and the strait of hormuz 
we hope that iran would respond favorably with these practical 
proposals and that you take the initiative in endorsing them and 
take the necessary steps to enforce them

a lake was reopened today after scientists 
found no remaining traces of bacteria that sickened at least 120 
swimmers 
officials said they believe an infected swimmer defecating in 
beltzville lake not leaking sewage introduced the shigella 
bacteria which causes shigellosis swimming at the reservoir has 
been banned since july 12 
shigellosis typically causes acute diarrhea fever and cramps 
and can be fatal in people who were ill before contracting it none 
of the victims of the outbreak here has been in danger of dying 
health officials said 
health department officials said the lake was contaminated july 
8 test results returned tuesday revealed no traces of the 
bacteria said department of environmental resources spokeswoman 
susan woods 
waterborne shigella usually are killed by sunlight within a few 
days officials said 
ms woods said the state will continue twiceaweek testing of 
the 949acre reservoir 
the common thread was that every person who tested positive 
for shigellosis not only went swimming at beltzville july 8 but 
could recall either swallowing water or having water go up their 
nose said health department spokesman bruce reimer 
while individual cases of shigellosis are fairly common health 
officials said outbreaks such as this are rare the federal centers 
for disease control in atlanta reported 12 outbreaks in the past 10 
years

washington the food and drug administration has decided 
against putting broad restrictions on the use of sulfites in foods 
according to an fda memo obtained today a consumer health group 
says up to a million people could be endangered by sulfites 
the center for science in the public interest said that a memo 
from fda commissioner frank e young to health and human services 
secretary otis bowen indicates that the fda plans to declare as 
safe nearly all currently unrestricted uses of sulfiting agents in 
food 
a separate action is pending to extend a 1986 ban on the use of 
sulfites on fresh fruits and vegetables such as salad bar items 
fresh potatoes have been exempted from the ban but fda spokesman 
chris lecos said a proposed extension affecting fresh potatotes 
would probably go into effect later this year 
lecos said the agency had no comment on the memo which he said 
was not available through his office nancy tiller of the fdas 
executive secretariat acknowledged the existence of the memo but 
said it was not for public release 
the associated press obtained a copy from a source outside the 
agency 
fda officials estimate that sulfites are dangerous to about 10 
percent of the 10 million people in the united states with asthma 
and to a small number of nonasthmatics but the chemicals which 
have been used for decades to prevent discoloration in food and 
also are used in some drugs to help them maintain their potency 
are put in the category formally known as generally regarded as 
safe 
the june 20 memo outlines plans on the regulation of sulfite use 
in foods and drugs the memo accompanied more than 100 pages of 
proposed regulations with a recommendation that they be acted upon 
by july 30 
the memo said the fda had considered prohibiting all uses of 
sulfites in food prohibiting it in additional foods or requiring 
labeling of all sulfitetreated food used in restaurants but 
rejected all of these proposals 
mitch zeller staff attorney for the consumer health group 
predicted that the fdas position is likely to be approved by 
health and human services saying it does so little and bends 
over backwards to placate the food industry

a mayor who faces an impeachment trial 
proclaimed national voodoo week on wednesday while wearing a 
white turban and a red cape but the state attorney general said 
the voodoo antics show why he should be ousted 
florala mayor ht mathis standing on the steps of the 
covington county courthouse read a proclamation at a midnight news 
conference saying national voodoo week begins at midnight 
friday 
mathis who faces an impeachment trial next month on charges of 
mismanagement and improperly pardoning drunken drivers stood in 
front of a table that had candles several halloween masks and a 
black rubber bat hanging on a string snakes were taped to his 
shoulders 
the 85yearold firstterm mayor said the publicity generated 
last year when he sprinkled voodoo dust around floralas city 
hall has been good for the town of 2200 residents on the 
alabamaflorida border 
the voodoo story like a television commercial has notified 
thousands of people that florala is a solid little town and its 
ideally located for any type of industry mathis said 
but later wednesday morning attorney general don siegelman made 
it clear he wasnt amused 
mathis continues to be a threat to the public safety and an 
embarrassment to the people of florala and covington county 
siegelman said adding that the news conference demonstrates his 
incompetence 
siegelman said the voodoo antics may or may not be an 
issue in his impeachment trial 
mathis accused siegelman who initiated the impeachment 
proceedings of trumping up the charges for his own political 
gain 
calling himself a christian mathis said he does not believe in 
black magic but that since the media has turned him into the 
voodoo mayor he will use the opportunity for publicity 
siegelman has accused mathis of mismanagement and improperly 
pardoning more than two dozen drunken drivers mathis who is 
seeking a second term said he has pardoned numerous driving 
convictions because of what he calls overzealousness by city police 
siegelman asked a judge to impanel a county grand jury which 
brought the charges a state court jury will hear the case if he 
is convicted mathis would be removed from office but would still 
be able to run in this years election 
sue chambers mathis daughter said she was afraid her fathers 
credibility might be hurt she said her father was making a mockery 
of voodoo 
i hope they will take it for what its meant but i dont know 
that she said 
regardless mathis said he planned to continue using voodoo 
its more or less fun its a joke i do not believe in it so 
far as im concerned said mathis now theres a lot of 
witchraft going on though theres a man practicing it just 
across the georiga line

with trumpet fanfare and honor guards queen 
elizabeth ii celebrated with parliament on wednesday the 300th 
anniversary of the glorious revolution that curbed royal power and 
paved the way for democratic freedoms 
the queen speaking in parliaments 11thcentury westminster 
hall told 1500 lawmakers and guests the bloodless events that led 
to constitutional monarchy and a bill of rights ushered in an 
epoch of freedom under the law 
it was the beginning of a political process which has 
continued to the present day she said flanked by the bewigged 
leaders of the two british houses of parliament as well as leaders 
of nearly 40 commonwealth countries which inherited their 
parliamentary systems from the british empire 
some wore britishstyle black robes others turbans tricorner 
hats or tribal skirt and beads 
no one could claim even today that the state has been 
perfected in multicultural britain there is still a long way to 
go she said but after 1688 there were signposts to point the 
way 
a bevy of royalty including the heir to the dutch throne prince 
william of orange and a us delegation led by former supreme 
court chief justice warren e burger from the college of william amp 
mary in virginia also sat near the queen during the 
pageantryfilled ceremony 
william and mary a staunchly protestant dutch prince and his 
english bride took over the throne as constitutional monarchs 
ruling with parliaments consent after opposition to the 
authoritarian procatholic rule of james ii englands last 
absolute monarch drove him to exile mary was james daughter and 
william his nephew and third in line to the english throne 
after the new monarchs arrived from holland they accepted a 
parliamentmade declaration of rights which became law in 1689 and 
underlined parliaments powers called for it to meet frequently 
and for its members to enjoy free speech and be elected freely 
it barred the throne from imposing taxes or raising armies in 
peace time without parliaments approval 
nearly 100 years later the restless american colonies drew from 
the english bill of rights and its resistance to authoritarianism 
in drafting their own declaration of independence and constitution 
it was a good example said burger chancellor of the 
college which was founded by william and mary in 1693 and 
designated by the us congress with presidential approval to 
represent the country at the ceremony 
the glorious revolution was really the concept of we the 
people he said in an interview before the ceremony it was 
the beginning of the end of the divine right of kings 
wednesdays ceremony was one highlights of a year of 
tercentenary celebrations the tercentenary which will be feted 
with events from exhibitions to bicyle races also has raised 
controversy 
some historians argue that after 1688 power remained with the 
upper classes and catholics were oppressed most notably in 
ireland where james tried to stage a comeback and was defeated by 
william in 1690 at the battle of the boyne 
jonathan clark an oxford university professor who has written 
two books on the era said in an interview that freedoms evolved 
slowly 
they must be defended but i dont think they can be 
safeguarded by pointing to one document its dangerous to deal in 
illusions he said 
addressing wednesdays gathering speaker of the house of 
commons bernard weatherill said some have questioned the 
significance of the revolutionary settlement of 1689 and the 
motives of those involved 
but the facts are plain before the bill of rights was passed 
those rights often had been set aside or denied since 1689 they 
have never been successfully challenged 
the queen her husband the duke of edinburgh and the dutch 
prince william were spending the night at torbay in southern 
england near the spot where william landed on thursday they will 
watch 400 dutch and british boats reenact williams arrival

white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater on wednesday defended his former boss vice president 
george bush against the where was george attacks of sen 
edward m kennedy and delegates to the democratic convention in 
atlanta 
kennedy dmass repeatedly asked where was george on 
specific issues in a speech at the convention on tuesday night 
prompting delegates to chant the same words in response 
fitzwater who was bushs press secretary before becoming white 
house spokesman commented george was cutting taxes not raising 
them george was defending america not tearing it down george was 
leading the drug interdiction effort not blowing smoke and george 
was pushing arms control not cutting defense 
the spokesman declined comment however on an apparent 
reference to first lady nancy reagan in the convention speech of 
democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson 
jackson told the delegates that in fighting drug abuse it is 
necessary to do more than just say no mrs reagans antidrug 
slogan or to consult an astrologer as mrs reagan has 
acknowledged that she does on some matters 
in the course of the convention you are going to see all 
kinds of hyperbole and outrage and silly statements from all of the 
candidates and party members fitzwater said thats what 
conventions are all about but we wont respond to them 
individually 
fitzwater said he did not know what parts if any of the 
convention president and mrs reagan had watched on television at 
their ranch north of santa barbara where they are vacationing he 
said he assumed they were watching parts of it

michael dukakis often depicted as the hightech 
governor used pen and paper to work on the words he would use to 
accept the presidential nomination because he doesnt use a 
personal computer aides said wednesday 
dukakis spent much of his private time during the democratic 
national convention putting the speech through at least three major 
drafts with the revisions entered into a wordprocessing computer 
by aides 
the governor does not use a computer said christopher 
edley the campaigns issues director 
ive only tried to get him to use a lap top computer once 
he added he humored me for three or four minutes and that was 
it 
aides did not invite comparison to jesse jacksons emotionally 
stirring speech of the night before except edley said both 
would prove to be kind of a greatest hits collection from 
earlier campaign speeches 
were going to let dukakis be dukakis edley said 
ensconced in his penthouse hotel suite dukakis has been going 
over triplespaced drafts of the speech prepared by two aides 
penning changes between the lines in the margins and on legal pads 
aides discussed dukakis preparations as the massachusetts 
governor was still at work on the speech he is to deliver thursday 
night they said the final version was not yet prepared 
edley said dukakis plans to place primary focus on creating 
economic opportunity and security for all americans and also to 
touch on redirecting foreign policy in areas such as central 
america and south africa 
he will criticize the republicans for romantic attachment to 
the status quo in both domestic and foreign policy edley said 
but the speech is not planned as stridently partisan 
it will be a positive speech edley said there is not 
going to be a harsh partisan edge to it that is not the dukakis 
style 
aides said no surprises were planned and that he would to stick 
to the basic themes and issues he commonly mentions affordable 
housing quality education health care and advance notice to 
workers losing jobs because of plant closings 
for much of the public that will be watching this speech it 
will be the first serious look at who michael dukakis is and where 
he wants to take this country edley said so an effort to 
distill the essence of the candidacy is perfectly appropriate 
the message doesnt change from week to week the themes dont 
change from week to week he said

president reagan signed an 18 
billion energy and water bill wednesday and commended congress for 
enacting the measure promptly and holding spending to levels 
acceptable to the administration 
reagan said in a statement that the bill had been submitted to 
him earlier in the year than any other appropriation bill since he 
took office in 1981 he urged the lawmakers to act quickly on the 
remaining 12 appropriations bills 
the bill is the first regular spending measure to get reagans 
signature since december 1985 
in recent years appropriations bill have been lumped together 
in catchall emergency spending measures enacted at the end of the 
fiscal year the bills are being enacted separately this year as a 
result of last falls deficitreduction agreement between reagan 
and congressional leaders that decided in advance the overall 
spending levels for military foreign aid and domestic agency 
programs 
as i noted in my state of the union address earlier this 
year reagan said the use of patchedtogether 
multiplepurpose spending bills does not permit the legislative and 
executive branches to exercise proper scrutiny of government 
spending 
the public interest is best served when budget laws are 
enacted individually after careful deliberation and well 
before the crisis atmosphere sets in at the end of the fiscal year 
in september he said i therefore urge the congress to 
complete consideration of the remaining 12 appropriations bills and 
to transmit them to me in a timely manner as well 
reagan said the appropriations in the energy and water bill do 
not exceed the amounts i requested in my budget while fully funding 
the essential requests for atomic energy defense activities 
i want to take this opportunity to commend the congress 
for keeping funding contained in this act at acceptable levels 
he said 
the bill was one of five signed by the president as he 
vacationed at his mountaintop ranch north of santa barbara 
the others were an authorization bill for the national 
transportation safety board a codification of measures affecting 
the defense department a measure reauthorizing us participation 
in an international energy program and a bill naming a federal 
courthouse in portland maine for judge edward gignoux

president reagans spokesman said 
wednesday that the contras face a period of uncertainty but 
that the election of col enrique bermudez to the directorate of 
the nicaraguan resistance will likely prove beneficial to the 
contra cause 
marlin fitzwater also said that we would not expect his 
becoming an official member of it to change the policies or 
directions in any substantial way 
when asked about the resignations of seven commanders in the 
resistance forces southern front in protest of bermudezs 
ascension to the top leadership post fitzwater replied i dont 
really know what the seven commander situation is in terms of 
exactly what their status is now or how that will affect the 
operations of the contras themselves i dont think theres 
anything to worry about 
fitzwater said that the leadership of the resistance force was 
merely getting its act together and that the contras face a 
period of uncertainty 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega has unilaterally extended a 
ceasefire to aug 30 but at the same time his sandinista regime 
recently cracked down on political opponents and expelled us 
ambassador richard melton and seven associates 
seven commanders along the contras southern military front quit 
the organization monday after bermudez 56 was elected to the 
sevenmember directorate of the resistance force 
bermudez was a colonel in president anastasio somozas army 
before somoza was deposed by the sandinistas in 1979 
fitzwater said that concerns about the colonels past 
connections with somoza have always been there for anybody who 
wanted to draw on them the fact is he has been the military 
leader of the contras he has not hidden that fact 
the spokesman said the resistance force has some internal 
problems because of congress cutoff of funds and the 
uncertainties that theyve faced in the peace process he said it 
appears that the contra directorate is trying to fashion a course 
as best they can at this point and the election of bermudez 
should be helpful in the sense that hes been an integral part of 
the military leadership all the way

lost an estimated 600000 in stolen texts in the last year and 
says some of those books ended up two doors away at a branch of 
wallaces bookstores inc 
coop president george mitchell said tuesday he believes a theft 
ring specializing in textbooks and advanced professional journals 
a few dishonest employees and lax security combined to make the 
bookstore easy pickings 
university coop said in its complaint that the wallaces branch 
paid 2000 for technical books on advanced engineering chemistry 
and other subjects and resold them for 4000 to independent book 
broker wes berkovsky 
mitchell said he was angry that wallaces bought and sold the 
books without notifying him another austin bookstore halfprice 
books bought 1400 worth of books but called as soon as it 
realized they were stolen mitchell said 
it was the second time wallaces bookstores has been involved in 
a stolen books case this year in a georgia case executives of 
lexingtonbased wallaces also denied knowing that a supplier had 
been shipping stolen books to the central warehouse in lexington 
ky 
wilkinson founded the company and is chairman but he has not 
been involved in its daily operation for several years according 
to bookstore employees 
the stolen books retail value was estimated as low as 20000 
by wallaces officials in lexington and as high as 44000 by 
berkovsky according to a report tuesday in the lexington 
heraldleader 
john schudy manager of wallaces austin store said he did not 
remember buying technical books or selling them to berkovsky 
mitchell said no one from wallaces told him stolen coop books 
were being offered to other book dealers nor did anyone suggest 
that wallaces had been offered books that might have been stolen 
from the coop he said 
schudy said he went to the coop only to discuss ways the coop 
could reduce shoplifting not to show coop employees suspicious 
books 
halfprice manager john wiley said he became suspicious after 
two men appeared several times wanting to sell books about half 
of which had titles i couldnt even pronounce 
after a while you get suspicious wiley said when a guy 
who looks like he doesnt study very much walks in with a 100 book 
that he is more than willing to sell for 2 or 3 something isnt 
right its unfortunate but its something that happens students 
are particularly vulnerable 
although wilkinson has disavowed involvement in the companys 
daily operations the heraldleader reported that state telephone 
records show dozens of calls between the governors office and 
wallaces headquarters 
doug alexander wilkinsons press secretary said most of the 
calls to the book company were probably his seeking information on 
the governors business background for reporters

republican leaders made it clear wednesday that 
they plan to direct their fall political attack against a 
democratic troika that includes jesse jackson as well as 
michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen 
illinois gov james thompson said michael dukakis granted 
jackson virtually the same status in the campaign as he did 
bentsen the texas senator he has picked to be his vice 
presidential running mate 
governor dukakis has accepted jesse jackson as his partner in 
this campaign elevated him to a position equal to or perhaps 
higher than his nominal running mate lloyd bentsen thompson said 
thompson called it a clever strategy to offer bentsen as the 
soothing reassuring conservative but he said my guess is 
those two partners of the troika dukakis and jackson will soon 
leave bentsen in the dust 
thompsons comments came as part of a republican truth squad 
which has held dailing news conferences this week in atlanta to 
present the gop side of things during the democratic convention 
thompson was joined by virginia sen john warner and texas rep 
beau boulter who is running against bentsen for the senate 
all used the term troika to describe the democratic ticket 
repeatedly mentioning jackson who most polls show hurts democratic 
chances in the fall campaign against certain nominee george bush 
michael dukakis has tied jesse jackson to this ticket rather 
firmly thompson said with bentsen whispering in one ear and 
jackson whispering in his other ear who is dukakis going to listen 
to i think thats the question the american people need to 
have answered 
thompson himself has been mentioned as a potential running mate 
for bush but he downplayed any suggestions that he was campaigning 
for the job 
there are a number of qualified candidates thompson said 
theres no lack of talent in our party 
in addition to being dukakis pick for the no 2 spot on the 
ticket bentsen is running for reelection to his senate seat 
simultaneous campaigns that are allowed under texas law 
lloyd bentsen wants it both ways boulter said contending 
that bentsen should have the courage to decide which office he 
wants to run for 
the selection of bentsen as a running mate is viewed as an 
effort to cut into republican strength in the south but boulter 
said republicans will make sure the conservative texan is saying 
the same things in all regions of the nation 
in the other 49 states hes going to have to campaign i 
suppose on michael dukakis platform boulter said i expect 
him to say different things in texas to the voters there than 
hes saying in the other 49 states 
boulter also repeated gop attacks on bentsen for the 6 million 
campaign chest hes built for his senate race arguing that money 
will be spent instead to boost the dukakisbentsen ticket 
warner ranking republican on the senate armed services 
committee attacked democrats for the platform they adopted on 
tuesday 
the defense platform indeed is a smokescreen warner said 
clearly were seeing deception in the areas of national defense 
and foreign policy 
in another attack on the democrats l brent bozell executive 
director of the conservative victory committee previewed planned 
television ads criticizing dukakis for his 1977 veto of a bill 
requiring school children to recite the pledge of allegiance 
hes a 100 percent dyedinthewool bleeding heart liberal 
whos completely out of touch with the american public bozell 
told a news conference

related to the convention which has brought an estimated 35000 
visitors the fbi said it was giving the matter more than routine 
attention 
were not treating it as a runofthemill thing said 
atlanta agent diader rosario any time you have a situation where 
explosives have been stolen certainly it is a very serious 
matter 
police spokeswoman myrna may said there had been several 
reported sightings of a tan van that was used to transport the 
dynamite 
one was near the state capitol and another was near the omni 
where the convention is being held she said on wednesday bomb 
squad officers were searching tan vans in the convention zone 
rosario said the fbi was aware of a reported threat to blow up 
an abortion clinic but added i dont have any further 
information regarding that 
henry county sheriffs capt keith mcbrayer said two cases of 
explosives were stolen tuesday from a blasting company worker each 
case contained 50 pounds of dynamite or about 200 sticks and 200 
blasting caps he said

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini told his 
people wednesday accepting a truce with iraq was like drinking 
poison but asked them to support his decision and said those 
martyred by the war had benefited 
until this week khomeini had been adamant in opposing an end to 
the war which began in september 1980 with border skirmishes and 
an iraqi invasion until president saddam hussein of iraq was 
driven from power 
i shall say again that the acceptance of this issue is more 
deadly to me than poison but i am happy to submit to gods will 
and drank this cup for his satisfaction the 87yearold 
revolutionary patriarch said in a statement 
although the statement said he could not immediately reveal the 
reasons for changing his mind it said he acted on the 
recommendation of military and political leaders khomeinis 
statement was his first since the government said monday it would 
accept a yearold un ceasefire resolution 
in view of the opinion of all highranking political and 
military experts i agreed with the acceptance of the resolution 
and ceasefire and under the existing juncture i believe this to 
be in the interest of the revolution and the system he said his 
statement was distributed by irans official islamic republic news 
agency which was monitored in nicosia 
irans acceptance of un resolution 598 does not mean the war 
is over khomeini said but added that the decision was not just a 
tactic to allow the iranian military to regroup iraq has made that 
accusation 
he said the war had been good for the people who were martyred 
and good for those whose children were martyred western 
estimates put the number of dead and wounded in the 8yearold 
conflict at 1 million divided about evenly between the two sides 
shiite moslems the overwhelming majority in iran revere the 
martyrdom of the prophet mohammeds grandson hussein in 680 in an 
islamic factional war from which the sunni and shiite branches of 
the faith developed 
khomeini repeated several times that he did not want to accept 
the resolution and said he felt ashamed in front of such a great 
nation he also told the public and media not to create a furor 
over questions that would not be answered immediately 
the patriarch said iran has yet to settle accounts with the 
united states which he calls the great satan and with saudi 
arabia and kuwait 
i hereby warn the american and european military forces to 
leave the persian gulf before it is too late he declared 
without elaboration about 60 foreign warships are stationed in and 
around the gulf 27 of them american

the hoover institution the thinktank 
that generated many of the reagan administrations conservative 
ideas must pick a new leader of its own following a decision by 
its longtime director to step down 
w glenn campbells decision follows months of debate about the 
affiliation between stanford university and the oncampus 
institution that will soon be home to secretary of state george 
shultz and attorney general edwin meese iii 
campbell who succeeded founder and former president herbert 
hoover in 1960 said the new director will have to be a leader 
who can provide a climate where all these prima donnas can live 
together 
the announcement came two months after campbell vowed to sue if 
stanford tried to oust him at 65 because it was the customary 
retirement age at the university campbell had planned on staying 
another five years 
campbell said he is stepping aside in part because hes weary of 
fighting stanford i used to be a young warrior now im an aging 
warrior but not yet an old warrior he said 
six nobel laureates are associated with the think tank 
including economist milton friedman and soviet writer alexander 
solzhenitsyn 
president reagan is an honorary fellow and several of his 
advisers including economist martin anderson national security 
expert richard allen and special envoy philip habib are among the 
more than 100 hoover scholars 
campbell met with hoovers board of overseers on wednesday and 
said he would make a public statement thursday at the conclusion of 
the meeting 
however in an interview monday with the associated press he 
described his decision his vision of hoovers future and his 
assessment of its achievements under his leadership 
his legacy he said is the development of an institution of 
ideas and distinction filled with distinguished scholars who can 
exchange ideas with each other 
he is proud that hoover participated in the reagan 
revolution and in the promotion of peace he said 
over the next decade he said hed like to see hoover 
strengthen its pacific basin program create a fund for the 
promotion of peace reach out more to the public through the media 
and become the site of a separate professional school for 
international relations 
campbell said hoover will keep its independence from stanford 
and remain an important policy research center 
i hope the president will come here regularly again after he 
gets over his annoyance with stanfords administration and 
faculty campbell said referring to the universitys rejection 
last year of a reagan library and policy center 
meese has accepted campbells invitation to join hoover as a 
visiting fellow while he writes a book on his years with reagan 
shultz an honorary fellow will return to work on a series of 
documentaries on policymaking at the state department while he 
teaches a public policy course at stanfords graduate school of 
business 
campbell said he would not fight the decision of stanfords 
trustees to retire him next year probably about six months after 
he turns 65 in april but said he wanted to make sure there is a 
smooth transition to his successor 
he said he would hold the title of counselor serve as 
exofficio member of all selection and advisory committees and 
stay in his current office formerly occupied by president hoover 
campbell had originally called stanfords effort to retire him 
an attempted takeover motivated by politics and greed and noted 
several exceptions to the retireat65 rule 
stanford president donald kennedy and former trustees president 
warren christopher were carter administration officials and the 
majority of the faculty are democrats 
campbell an unabashed conservative republican said the problem 
between hoover and stanford is not as simple as politics alone 
all these people at stanford want is the money and 
buildings said campbell whose large woodpaneled office is on 
the 11th floor of the landmark hoover tower in the center of campus 
campbell a harvard economist who once had former federal 
reserve board chairman paul volcker as a student helped boost a 2 
million endowment to its current level of more than 110 million 
john f manley a liberal professor of political science at 
stanford and a longtime hoover institution critic has denounced it 
as a political operation in the midst of what is supposed to be a 
nonpartisan university 
however seymour martin lipset a hoover sociologist and 
political scientist and former johnson administration official 
said hoover should not be labeled a conservative think tank 
he said hoovers fellows have a range of political opinions 
and interests that covers the gamut from socialist to extreme 
conservative

the federal communications commission moved a 
step closer wednesday toward allowing telephone companies to 
provide cable television services 
an 18yearold fcc rule and a 4yearold law bar telephone 
companies from running cable systems in their own service areas 
but the fcc indicated by a series of actions wednesday it favors 
lifting those prohibitions 
the commission called the prohibitions a draconian form of 
regulation that no longer is needed because the cable industry has 
become large and strong enough to compete with the telephone 
companies 
the fcc voted tentatively to recommend to congress that it 
repeal the 1984 prohibition against telephone companies providing 
cable television services and directed its staff to begin the 
process of repealing its own rule against such activity 
it also asked the staff to formally define what would be good 
cause for waivers of the prohibition as allowed by the law and 
the rule by that action the commission indicated that it could 
use waivers to allow telephone companies into the cable television 
business even if the l984 law is not rescinded 
if telephone companies are allowed to operate cable systems the 
consumer will benefit from increased video services including home 
shopping and video phones as well as having an additional source 
of pay television programming the commission said 
james p mooney president of the national cable television 
association suggested that consumers basic phone bills would 
increase if the telephone companies delve into cable television 
consumers would find themselves forced to subsidize 
highrisk investments in pay tv the only certain results would be 
to push telephone rates even higher than they are now he said in 
a statement 
while it will be up to congress to lift its prohibition and the 
fcc is not expected to develop a final recommendation to capitol 
hill until later this year the commission made clear it believes 
the existing prohibitions are out of date 
cable companies can serve about 80 percent of the homes in the 
nation the commission said 
thus in contrast to 1970 when the commission rule was adopted 
telephone companies no longer can enjoy the advantage of being 
the first provider of cable television service or preemptively 
eliminate competition from independent cable operators the 
commission said 
there is a general consensus among the fcc commissioners 
that the current prohibitions against cabletelephone cross 
ownership are no longer the most appropriate or most desirable 
form of regulation gerald brooks chief of the fccs common 
carrier bureau told reporters

michael dukakis saying i think its for 
real was poised to win the democratic presidential nomination 
tonight in a primetime roll call of delegates energized by waves 
of ridicule directed at george bush 
this has been a real kick dukakis said this afternoon 
looking back over a 17month quest for the nomination and the right 
to challenge republican bush in november 
standing alongside his wife kitty at a reception the 
massachusetts governor said as we we came into atlanta on 
sunday i turned to my bride and i said well i think its for 
real i mean this is happening the audience cheered 
both dukakis and jesse jackson survivors from a field of seven 
will have their names entered in nomination dukakis began the day 
with a commanding 2763 delegates compared to 1161 for jackson 
and had exercised his muscle by winning a brief and moderate 
platform 
jackson who captivated the convention with a forceful address 
tuesday night acknowledged the obvious this morning asked if he 
planned to endorse and work for the ticket he said oh yes i 
am he said his role must be defined by gov dukakis 
just hours before tonights convention session the two 
candidates met privately in dukakis hotel suite for more than an 
hour accompanied by senior aides and texas sen lloyd bentsen 
dukakis running mate 
afterward jackson said basically it was a getacquainted 
meeting for staff and key policy advisers most of whom do not know 
each other but now must work together since we are in the same boat 
with a common objective that is to win in november 
jackson added as you end the primary campaign you fold in 
some means of becoming friends developing new and different 
relationships 
earlier dukakis toured the omni convention hall trying out the 
podium where he will deliver his acceptance speech thursday night 
dukakis aides said the governor was still working on the address 
which has gone through multiple drafts 
christopher edley campaign issues director said dukakis would 
focus on economic security and opportunity and would accuse the 
republicans of romantic attachment to the status quo in both 
domestic and foreign policy 
were going to let dukakis be dukakis edley said 
at the afternoon reception dukakis spoke warmly of his wife and 
said both he and jackson were blessed with good families 
he said a woman in tobaccorich north carolina told him recently 
she planned to vote for him when he asked why she replied your 
wife smokes 
making clear he wasnt happy about the fact that his wife does 
smoke dukakis said i dont have to tell you what kind of first 
lady shes going to be a nonsmoking first lady again the 
audience laughed 
earlier the nomineeinwaiting telphoned jackson and told him 
i thought the speech was terrific 
dukakis spent part of the morning at a youth club in conyers 
outside atlanta discussing the battle against illegal drugs he 
said young people can be the best helpers in that effort and he 
told the youngsters you tell me what you want me to do as 
president 
dukakis who has spent much of his time the past several days at 
his hotel headquarters said the problem with being a candidate 
is they never let you out of the hotel room so this is a joy to 
me 
jackson even though he is certain to lose said he wants his 
name placed in nomination as a testament to the struggles of our 
fathers and mothers 
he said today that his mission was to pave the way for a 
black to win the white house 
my children and your children will get through those doors 
and the white house is within reach he told nbcs bryant gumbel 
the today shows black anchorman i am pushing back barriers 
and removing ceilings off of dreams every day i see it as my 
obligation in a real sense now my mission 
jackson had his night in the spotlight tuesday delivering a 
graceful swan song before a noisy and excited house citing 
dangerous overcrowding police sealed all entrances to the omni 
shortly before jackson spoke locking out about 1000 delegates 
guests and reporters 
inside the hall jackson declared we meet tonight at a 
crossroads a point of decision shall we expand be inclusive 
find unity and power or suffer division and impotence 
the only time we win is when we come together jackson said 
as his supporters waved a sea of red banners proclaiming 
jesse on orders from dukakis floor leaders the governors 
supporters kept their own bluecolored placards out of sight 
sen edward m kennedy dmass and other speakers trained 
their sights on vice president bush the certain nominee when the 
republicans convene next month in new orleans 
kennedy derided bush as the man who keeps burying his head in 
his hands and hiding from the record of the reaganbush mistakes 
texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower told the delegates 
that bush was a toothache of a man who doesnt care about the 
problems of anyone but the rich 
george has always been in another world his is an upperclass 
world in which wealth is given to you at birth hightower said 
he is a man who was born on third base and thinks he hit a 
triple 
the convention already had rebuffed jacksons calls for higher 
taxes on the wealthy and a pledge to reject the first use of 
nuclear weapons instead delegates approved a dukakisendorsed 
platform worded in such general terms that it wont provide much of 
a target for republicans 
showing no sign of defeat jackson told the delegates tonight 
i salute gov michael dukakis he has run a wellmanaged and 
dignified campaign no matter how tired or how tried he always 
resisted the temptation to stoop to demagoguery 
jackson said his foreparents came to american in immigrant 
ships my foreparents came to american in slave ships 
but whatever the original ships we are in the same boat 
tonight 
keep hope alive keep hope alive keep hope alive he 
shouted in conclusion sparking an eruption of cheers and applause 
as the partys nominee dukakis will face bush the target 
during the second night of the convention of verbal abuse from some 
of the democrats top stars 
bush emerges today from the seclusion of a fishing trip in 
wyoming to go on the campaign trail and try to divert attention 
from dukakis triumph the vice president will campaign in the 
detroit area in the first stop on an eightstate tour

an unpublished memo written by the head of the 
food and drug administration shows the agency wants to reject 
proposals for broader limitations on sulfite food preservatives 
despite estimates that the chemicals can be extremely dangerous to 
a million or more americans 
a consumer health group said wednesday the fdas failure to act 
endangers many asthmatics and others who have a severe reaction to 
sulfites including the possibility of death within hours after 
food containing the chemicals is eaten 
sulfites which have been used for decades to prevent 
discoloration in food have been banned since 1986 for use on fresh 
fruits and vegetables such as those sold in salad bars fresh 
potatoes have been exempted from the ban but will be included 
later this year fda officials say 
the fda memo written by commissioner frank e young says the 
agency proposes to affirm its classification of sulfites as 
generally recognized as safe for other foods young 
acknowledges in the document that many new uses have been found for 
sulfites and that a significant number of individuals have 
experienced severe allergictype responses 
other fda officials have estimated that sulfites are dangerous 
to about 10 percent of the 10 million people in the united states 
with asthma and to a small number of nonasthmatics according to 
agency spokesman chris lecos 
the center for science in the public interest a privately 
funded consumer health group says sulfites have caused coma brain 
damage and at least five deaths 
youngs memo says that a 1987 sulfite labeling requirement for 
some packaged foods would be extended to additional items but not 
to dehydrated or frozen potatoes which would remain exempt 
under existing rules all drugs must be labeled as to sulfite 
content 
the june 20 memo was addressed to health and human services 
secretary otis bowen whose department must sign off on over 100 
pages of regulations that accompanied the document 
mitch zeller staff attorney for the consumer group predicted 
that the fdas position would be approved by health and human 
services saying it does so little and bends over backwards to 
placate the food industry 
lecos said the fda had no comment on the memo nancy tiller of 
the fdas executive secretariat acknowledged the existence of the 
memo but said it was not for public release the associated press 
obtained a copy from a source outside the agency 
the memo said the fda had considered prohibiting all uses of 
sulfites in food broadening the ban to include other foods or 
requiring labeling of all sulfitetreated food used in restaurants 
the memo says the available safety data does not support a 
complete ban or an extension to foods other than those already 
covered except for fresh potatoes health groups have said it 
should also cover processed and frozen potatoes 
restaurant labeling would be labor intensive and difficult to 
enforce the memo says adding that it would require regular 
inspection of over 500000 eating establishments 
the memo asks for action on the proposed regulations by july 30

an investigator testified 
wednesday that a lebanese shiite moslem charged in the hijacking of 
a twa jet admitted joining a radical group linked to the 
kidnappings of westerners in beirut 
the defendant mohammed ali hamadi told the court trying him 
that he hates the united states which sought his extradition 
hamadi is charged with air piracy and murder in the june 1985 
hijacking of twa flight 847 to beirut thirtynine americans were 
held captive for 17 days and a us navy diver was killed during 
the ordeal 
west german federal police investigator heinrich brandtjen said 
hamadi admitted joining the radical hezbollah group after the twa 
hijacking 
hamadi was arrested and charged with carrying liquid explosives 
at frankfurt airport in 1987 
he told me he has belonged to hezbollah since the autumn of 
1985 or 1986 but i cannot remember exactly the year brandtjen 
told the court 
hezbollah or party of god is believed to be the umbrella 
organization for proiranian groups holding 18 foreign hostages in 
lebanon including nine americans hamadi denied last week that he 
had been a member of hezbollah 
one of hamadis brothers abdulhadi hamadi is the beirut 
security chief of hezbollah another brother is accused of 
kidnapping two west germans in lebanon in a bid to force german 
authorities to free mohammed hamadi 
when brandtjen was asked if mohammed hamadis actions were 
linked to those of his brother abdulhadi brandtjen said he 
told me that he had stood under the orders of his brother 
abdulhadi hamadi he told me his brother was not directly 
involved in military operations of hezbollah but had a mediating 
role between rival factions 
during the time the questioning was taking place the west 
germans were coming under pressure from washington to extradite 
hamadi to the united states a request which was ultimately turned 
down 
when hamadi was given a copy of the us extradition request 
brandtjen quoted him as saying i had nothing to do with that 
hijacking 
in his testimony last week hamadi said his admissions to 
brandtjen came as a result of threats by west german authorities to 
extradite him to the united states unless he confessed brandtjen 
said no threats were made against hamadi 
the defendant also read from a statement he started tuesday and 
criticized us policy in the middle east 
chief judge heiner mueckenberger asked him do you hate the 
usa 
i grew up in lebanon in the middle of the war and one 
naturally asks himself why the answer was always america or 
israel with support of america hamadi replied i have hateful 
feelings for all that attacked us not just for the usa alone 
hamadi said through an interpreter 
abbas hamadi 29 was arrested jan 26 1987 at frankfurt 
airport when he returned after the kidnappings of west germans 
rudolf cordes and alfred schmidt in beirut schmidt was freed in 
september but cordes remains a hostage 
abbas hamadi was convicted in april of masterminding the 
kidnappings in a bid to force his brothers release and sentenced 
to 13 years in prison

the government on wednesday identified 
four arabs it suspects of being involved in a terrorist attack on a 
greek cruise ship and tied the leader to a 1978 killing claimed by 
the abu nidal terrorist group 
public order minister anastasios sehiotis said police had been 
able to piece together events leading up to the attack by gunmen on 
passengers of the liner city of poros on july 11 nine people were 
killed and 98 were wounded in the gunfire and grenade attack off a 
greek island 
sehiotis said the government suspects that hejab jaballa who 
holds a libyan passport led the guerrilla attack 
police had also identified jaballa as taking part in the 
assassination of an egyptian newspaper editor in nicosia cyprus 
in 1978 he said 
jaballas fingerprints from cyprus were matched with those 
uncovered in his athens hideouts sehiotis said 
renegade palestinian terrorist abu nidal said in a magazine 
interview after the egyptian was shot that his group was 
responsible for the assassination abu nidal whose real name is 
sabri banna gets much of his funding from libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi and maintains headquarters in tripoli 
sehiotis identified the other three suspects as aboul amoud 
adnan sojod and merhi mehieddine their nationalities were not 
known the minister read a prepared statement and declined to 
answer reporters questions 
the statement failed to clarify whether any of the suspects were 
dead or had fled the country 
police believe that one or possibly two of the suspects may have 
died either in an explosion on the ships bridge as they lobbed 
hand grenades or in a car bomb that apparently detonated 
prematurely at a marina near athens six hours before the city of 
poros was scheduled to dock 
two occupants of the car were killed by the explosion 
the minister said jaballa arrived in greece on a flight from 
copenhagen june 1 his alleged accomplices arrived from beirut via 
belgrade in may 
all four men rented apartments or stayed in various hotels 
changing locations often prior to the day of the ship attack 
sehiotis said 
all the evidence indicates that jaballa played the leading 
role in the terrorist operation since he had all the details of 
members of his group in his possession said sehiotis 
ministry officials distributed copies of photographs from forged 
passports found in hotel rooms and apartments the men allegedly 
stayed in and at the site of the car explosion 
greek police have been reluctant to discuss what terrorist group 
could be responsible for the attack on the ship but cia director 
william webster said in washington last week that it appeared to be 
the work of the abu nidal group 
at a separate news conference merchant marine minister 
evangelos yannopoulos said security had been boosted at all main 
ports and that commandoes would now be permanent crew members of 
cruise liners 
he said each ship would have five to 10 specially trained 
commandoes aboard responsible for neutralizing terrorists attacks 
yannopoulos was asked whether a dead 23yearold french 
passenger laurent vigneron was part of the terrorist group greek 
authorities have linked him to the attack but french officials 
have said they find no evidence he was involved 
there are indications based on the testimony of four 
witnesses that he vigneron participated in the terrorist 
attack said yannopoulos 
he said an autopsy showed that vigneron was hit by bullets in 
his shoulder but these were not the cause of his death he did not 
elaborate 
meanwhile security at the nations borders ports and at athens 
international airport was tight 
passengers boarding cruise ships and ferries were scrutinized 
closely and their luggage passed through xray machines

the security council on wednesday 
unanimously adopted a mild resolution expressing deep distress 
over the accidental us downing of an iranian airliner and urging 
rapid implementation of a un ceasefire and peace plan 
after days of negotiations and bargaining the 15member council 
adopted a watereddown document that would satisfy both the united 
states and iran and would not provoke a us veto 
the council session was requested by iran which had boycotted 
the council for eight years but returned to urge condemnation of 
the us military action and demand withdrawal of all us forces 
from the persian gulf 
the uss vincennes shot down the iran air jetliner on july 3 in 
the gulf killing all 290 people aboard the united states said the 
airliner was mistaken for an iranian fighter jet 
iran was unable to muster enough votes to condemn the united 
states 
diplomats said the council decided to delete controversial 
passages to ensure passage of the brief resolution it deleted a 
sentence proposed by iran calling on foreign naval forces to 
reassess their presence in the persian gulf it also deleted strong 
language of condemnation of the us military action 
the resolution said the council expresses its deep distress at 
the downing of an iranian civil aircraates to be in their seats promptly 
at the 7 
pm edt starting hour more than a thousand people were locked out 
on wednesday night when authorities shut the coliseum doors due to 
overcrowding 
thus was the stage set for the most peaceful nominating night 
the democrats have known since 1976 a result entirely unlike the 
tumultuous brokered convention scenarios that were fashionable in 
washington political salons when the campaign year began 
dukakis made short order of those scenarios as he did of his 
rivals he won the bronze medal when the first votes were counted 
in the iowa caucuses on a freezing cold night in february but won 
the gold in the new hampshire primary the following week and 
methodically began piling up delegates first by the handful and 
later by the hundreds 
it was a success that capped a remarkable political comeback 
elected governor of massachusetts in 1974 he lost a reelection 
bid in a primary campaign four years later in what his wife termed 
a public death 
he renewed himself in his four years out of power and has twice 
won statehouse terms since 
the massachusetts governor went into the roll call with 2798 
delegates according to the associated press count to 1168 for 
jackson that was hundreds more than the 2082 needed to win 
by day three the convention city had settled into a routine 
from the street vendors hawking everything from tshirts to jars of 
vidalia onion relish to the demonstrators showcasing their causes 
in a parking lot set aside for them a few blocks from the hall 
the security detail seemed large beyond numbers from the secret 
service to the georgia state troopers to the atlanta city police 
to the private security guards and more 
dukakis the man at the center of it all telephoned jackson to 
tell him i thought the speech was terrific 
aides said dukakis had tried to reach jackson the night before 
at the podium but couldnt get through there was irony in that 
dukakis said last week he tried and failed to reach jackson to tell 
him of bentsens selection as running mate but jackson felt he had 
been snubbed when he learned the news from a reporter 
the result was an outbreak of political tension that wasnt 
resolved until dukakis and jackson met privately for more than two 
hours before the conventions opening session on monday 
but that was then and this time no one seemed to care if 
dukakis couldnt get his call through 
aides said dukakis was polishing the acceptance speech that he 
will deliver at the conventions final session thursday night and 
would watch the nominating roll call on television in his hotel 
suite with his family 
at the luncheon for his wife he chided her about her smoking 
habits and said she would make a great first lady a no smoking 
first lady 
he added that when he arrived in atlanta last sunday to claim 
his prize he had told her this is a kicki think its for 
real i mean its happening 
in an interview on nbcs today program jackson said his 
mission was to pave the way for a black to someday reach the white 
house my children and your children will get through those 
doors he told bryant gumbel nbcs black anchorman 
democrats who fell by the campaign wayside admitted to some 
thoughts of what might have been even though they rallied behind 
the winner 
obviously there are mixed feelings confessed illinois sen 
paul simon whose own campaign ended during the spring 
reach for the hand of your fellow democrat and hold on tight 
were going to make this country over again said rep richard 
gephardt who won the iowa caucuses but quit the race a month later 
among the delegates the talk was of a healed party and unity 
for the fall campaign and of jacksons 45minute speech on 
wednesday night 
i think it was very stimulating very conciliatory and very 
much what the party needs said chicago alderman juan soliz a 
dukakis backer 
ron yengich an alternate from utah was so moved by jacksons 
tuesday night speech that he took a midnight detour on his way back 
to his hotel driving by the birthplace of slain civil rights 
leader martin luther king jr

president reagans spokesman said 
wednesday the administration was not surprised by lingering 
skirmishes in the iraniraq war voicing hope that it is merely a 
prelude to a ceasefire 
the fighting of course is continuing there as i think 
everyone assumed it would said spokesman marlin fitzwater 
briefing reporters at his seaside resort while reagan continued 
his weeklong vacation fitzwater said i think everyone assumed 
it would continue until the ceasefire so i think we should 
all assume that the war is receding and we can expect skirmishes 
until the ceasefire is agreed to 
fitzwater commented not long after united nations secretary 
general javier perez de cuellar announced he was dispatching a team 
to iran and iraq to seek implementation of a ceasefire under un 
security council resolution 598 
irans government had announced monday for the first time that 
it was unconditionally accepting the ceasefire resolution but on 
tuesday iraq bombed an iranian nuclear power plant and hit other 
iranian industrial targets 
fitzwater said the administration welcomed iraqs move to hold 
direct talks with iran as soon as possible on establishing a 
ceasefire in the nearly 8yearold war 
iraqs deputy foreign minister tariq aziz made the proposal in 
a message to perez de cuellar 
on another matter fitzwater reiterated that the united states 
is interested in improving relations with iran but he said this is 
not related to the continued captivity of eight americans held 
hostage by proiranian elements in iran 
the spokesman said the administration was continuing to do 
everything possible to win the release of the hostages but said 
we dont believe there should be any linkage of the 
hostageholding with the possible renewal of contacts with iranian 
government officials 
we have had that signal out for a number of months and 
whenever we have pressed them for names or assurances that there 
were authoritative persons with whom the us could do business 
we didnt hear back he said 
fitzwater said he thought that it had been at least a couple 
of months since the united states made any attempt at direct 
contacts with iranian officials 
we have continued to say that were open to it but it is up 
to iran and thats where the ball is now he said 
fitzwater has said in the past that the united states insists on 
dealing with iranians who can speak authoritatively for the 
revolutionary goverment of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the spokesman said us officials would have to be convinced of 
the legitimacy of any iranians who might be contacted because the 
administration wants no repetitions of the irancontra affair

the senator was pelted with questions what was 
he doing at the convention how did his speech go the night before 
how would michael dukakis handle rural issues and would iowa 
retain its firstinthenation presidential primary contest 
not exactly network fare 
but its the kind of interview thats going on dozens of times a 
day at the convention satellite news service the democratic 
partys equalopportunity showcase for tv stations too poor to come 
to the convention and politicians unlikely to show up on the 
network evening news 
thank you all this is a great thing youre wonderful youre 
wonderful sen tom harkin of iowa told the harried news service 
staff after finishing an interview with a tv journalist in sioux 
city 
earlier this week he had talked to stations in cedar rapids and 
ottumwa all of them unable to afford the trip to atlanta 
its in keeping with my feelings about helping small 
businesses small stations harkin said heck they ought to be 
able to have access to me too the big boys can afford to come 
themselves 
the convention satellite news service with 46 hours of 
transmissions scheduled during convention week is costing about 
300000 all of it paid for by congressional campaign 
organizations and associations of democratic governors mayors and 
state party chairs 
on a typical day this week the service is featuring about 70 
interviews and roundtable discussions on subjects such as the 
gender gap and the texas factor moderated by former cbs newsman 
ike pappas tape of senators and congressmen at their morning 
issues forums shot by three camera crews and hours of live 
evening floor coverage for any station that wants it 
the studio for what is grandly called the democratic national 
network is curtained off in royal blue cluttered inside with two 
cameras eight lights a couple of steel chairs with oatmeal 
cushions and a tv monitor on top of a metal suitcase 
a brief attempt to beautify the set floundered when a vase of 
roses borrowed earlier for the same purpose vanished from the 
office across the hall theyre gone so we dont do flowers 
said ginnie kontnik chief troubleshooter shrug next problem 
the operators of the service are sensitive to criticism that it 
can be considered a propaganda machine but they note that many 
hours are devoted to floor action and twoway interviews in which 
questions come directly from reporters and anchors sitting in tv 
studios in montana or iowa or oklahoma or maine 
theyre their own news editors their own reporters they ask 
the questions they edit the tape said kontnik who is director 
of the harriman communications center for house members in 
washington 
the questions are not the type that set a politician squirming 
but theyre bread and butter for local newscasts tulsa viewers 
probably do care about whether texas sen lloyd bentsens selection 
as vice president means anything to oklahoma 
he has a history of working with oklahomans he is a 
neighbor rep mike synar told an interviewer he mentioned 
oklahoma in virtually every answer he gave regardless of the 
questions beginning with a ringing prediction that oklahoma is 
going to be in the democratic ranks for the first time in years 
a scrap of paper guided administrative assistant gary catron as 
he questioned his boss rep richard stallings of idaho in an 
interview taped for stations in twin falls idaho falls pocatello 
and boise 
how will the dukakisbentsen ticket play in the west he asked 
stallings 
potential exists to carry many states stallings replied adding 
that dukakis is tremendously interested in trying to find out 
what our concerns are thats a first no other democrat has shown 
interest most tend to write off the west 
cut 
next in marched rep harold volkmer of missouri and the 
frantic pace a new face every five minutes continued 
this is insane kontnik said as she answered phone calls 
fielded questions sent aides out on urgent errands and tried to 
locate politicians scheduled for interviews five minutes later 
are we having fun yet asked paul byers manager of the news 
service 
seriously though everybody seems to be happy said byers 
an aide told him he said that one tv station was so happy they 
thought we had rehung the moon

while other delegates to the democratic national 
convention were shopping sunbathing eating lunch with mayors or 
taking pictures of each other dorothy eck and helen kerr were 
engaged in more serious pursuits 
they were talking with other women about problems facing women 
were here today said mrs kerr because we suddenly 
realized we are tired of listening to men 
when delegates look at the podium in the convention hall she 
said all they see is men men keeping track of time men ushering 
in visitors men orchestrating the playing or nonplaying of music 
and men hitting the buttons to move the podium up and down in order 
to make 6foot2 jesse jackson and 5foot8 michael dukakis the 
same height 
she explained that she has no quarrel with the democratic party 
which is scrupulous about dividing delegate representation evenly 
between men and women she thinks too that women are well 
represented among speakers 
but well there is that pervasive presence of men especially 
in the daytime caucuses and on the platform 
this morning when we were planning our day dorothy said 
lets find some women to listen to said mrs kerr 
thats how they wound up miles from the delegateclogged 
downtown area at a branch library where there was a southern 
hospitality womens style welcome delegates meeting 
ms eck and mrs kerr are from bozeman mont both are in their 
60s and they belie the image of the carousing funloving delegate 
who may or may not find time to make it into the convention hall 
from early in the morning when they attend a meeting of the 
montana delegation to after 11 at night when the convention ends 
the two women are on the go they went to a democratic national 
committee seminar then a session of the southern christian 
leadership conference and after the womens meeting were going to 
visit a musum all this before a convention session lasting five 
hours or more 
weve got a choice of 20 places to go said ms eck a state 
senator who headed the dukakis campaign in montana 
i was married to a regular army officer and didnt open my 
mouth said mrs kerr then i worked for the federal government 
and didnt open my mouth now its my turn to act 
she was particularly impressed with geraldine ferraro the 1984 
democratic vice presidential nominee who told a caucus tuesday 
that the reason more women arent considered for national office is 
because so few are running for other posts and working their way 
through the system 
has she run for office 
no said mrs kerr i havent the guts for it i want 
everybody to think im wonderful it would hurt too much to find 
out some people didnt think so

texas treasurer ann richards said wednesday that 
all the attention generated by her keynote speech to the democratic 
national convention is a little embarrassing and proceeded to 
once again turn her acid wit on vice president george bush 
speaking to a meeting of women activists ms richards recounted 
being asked by a reporter why women seem reluctant to support bush 
who is the certain republican nominee for president 
i said it was very hard to explain unless youve ever gone to 
a high school dance and looked at the stag line and there was that 
guy raising his eyebrows at you and you said to yourself oh lord 
i hope he doesnt ask me ms richards said 
on the opening night of this years convention ms richards 
unleashed a stinging attack on bush saying among other things that 
he was born with a silver foot in his mouth 
since that crowdpleasing speech ms richards has been the 
focus of heavy attention around the convention and on wednesday 
she quoted some advice given to her by veteran feminist bella 
abzug you just lean back and enjoy it 
i find all the attention a little embarrassing she said 
i know who i am 
in addition ms richards dismissed with a joke suggestions from 
admirers that she was vice presidential material 
i am not prepared to be vice president she said i need a 
lot more seasoning i need a lot more experience i need a lot more 
broadening 
i really know what my talents are she said i hope my 
future is full of wonderful things i think being vice president 
would be great im good at weddings im good at funerals 
ms richards also attacked the reagan administrations record on 
womens issues pointing to small gains women have made in income 
compared to men 
in a voice dripping with sarcasm she said in eight years 
its almost a 5 percent increase how can we possibly complain 
as usual it is up to the women to clean up the mess she 
said

the following are excerpts from a 
statement wednesday by irans leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
accepting a unsponsored ceasefire resolution toward ending the 
iraniraq war 
it contains direct quotes from the address carried by irans 
official islamic republic news agency tehran radio and iran 
televison and material paraphrased from the speech by irna no full 
text was released 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i shall say again that the acceptance of this issue is more 
deadly to me than poison but i am happy to submit to gods will 
and drank this cup for his satisfaction 
however thanks to some incidents and factors that i do not 
mention at this moment and god willing will become clear in the 
future and in view of the opinion of all the highranking 
political and military experts of the country whom i trust for 
their commitment sympathy and sincerity i agreed with the 
acceptance of the resolution and ceasefire and under the existing 
circumstances i believe this to be in the interest of the 
revolution and the system 
god knows that had it not been for the motive that all of us 
and our honor and credibility should be sacrificed in the interest 
of islam and the muslims i would never have agreed with this 
issue and to me it would have been more bearable to accept death 
and martyrdom 
i strongly recommend to the dear nation of iran to remain 
alert and vigilant 
the acceptance of the resolution by the islamic republic of 
iran does not mean a solution to the problem of war rather by 
announcing this decision the propaganda weapons of the 
worlddevourers against us is blunted but one cannot seriously and 
decisively predict the outcome of events 
the enemy has not abandoned his atrocities yet and it is 
likely that by seeking excuses he would continue his aggressive 
methods we must be ready and prepared to repulse the enemys 
possible aggression and our nation should not think the issue is 
over yet 
of course we formally announce that our objective is not to 
have a new tactic for continuation of the war 
khomeini told the nation that in light of the situation it is 
likely in future days some people may tend to indulge in polemics 
about the wisdom of the decision but suggested this should best be 
postponed until later 
he said the war had been good for the people who were martyred 
and good for those whose children were martyred 
on islams international policy khomeini said we are trying 
to enlighten other parts of the world with islam we have always 
sought and are still seeking to put an end to the domination of 
worlddevourers over the oppressed nations and uproot capitalism 
communism and zionism without fearing that us lackeys might 
accuse us of pursuing a policy of expansionism or founding a great 
empire 
we will try with all our might and even through armed 
struggles to prevent american policymakers from spreading their 
bullying policies 
i hereby warn the american and european military forces to 
leave the persian gulf before it is too late 
he praised freedomloving moslems who helped unveil the joint 
ussaudi arabian crime in mecca referring to the 1987 riot by 
iranian pilgrims in which 402 persons died mostly iranian he 
advised moslems to strive to tilt the balance of power to their own 
benefit or else the us and the soviet union will create new 
catastrophes under the pretext of safeguarding their vested 
interests 
khomeini said that god willing all moslems would raise their 
voice against all the worlds oppressors and prove that the 
superpowers and their servants and lackeys are among the most 
despicable creatures of this world 
are the worlds moslems going to forget the tragedy of the 
massacre of hundreds of scholars and thousands of men and women 
belonging to moslem sects during the length of the shameless life 
of the alsaud the ruling family of saudi arabia and also the 
tragedy of the massacre of the pilgrims in the house of god mecca 
the goverment of the alsaud has taken over the responsibility 
for controlling the pilgrims in the house of god and it is here 
that we say with confidence that the mecca incident is not a 
separate matter from the fundamental policy of the worlddevourers 
in routing freespirited moslems

for a host of upandcoming democrats who arent 
named dukakis or jackson the party convention provides a stage for 
them to strut their stuff and dream of bigger days to come 
among the rising stars who got to perform before the crowd of 
11000 in the omni and millions more watching on television 
arkansas gov bill clinton selected to nominate michael dukakis on 
wednesday night and texas treasurer ann w richards who skewered 
george bush in her folksy keynote address monday 
each harbors higher ambitions clinton to run for president 
himself one day and richards to become governor of the lone star 
state in 1990 
others play out bit roles at the 40th democratic national 
convention often making their entrance when the cameras of the 
national television networks are dark or turned the other way 
but for young politicians like louisiana state sen cleo fields 
who is all of 25 and texas state rep lena guerrero 30 just 
getting to the rostrum was a sign that somebody in the party 
hierarchy liked them 
fields spoke with passion tuesday evening on jesse jacksons 
futile bid to get the party to oppose first use of nuclear weapons 
regardless of the circumstances we must say america will not be 
the country that will end this world he declared 
guerrero a dukakis delegate from austin won high marks for her 
role in drafting the party platform she also made a primetime 
introduction tuesday of rep robert matsui of california who moved 
the adoption of the nofrills platform 
another texan jim hightower gave a national audience a taste 
of the populist oneliners that have made him a force back home 
the twoterm agriculture commissioner has his eyes on a us senate 
seat either republican sen phil gramms in 1990 or lloyd 
bentsens if the democrats capture the white house and set off a 
freeforall for that vacancy 
in a week filled with rhetorical fusillades aimed at george 
bush hightower may have scored a big hit with his quip he is a 
man who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple 
although his speech tuesday night did not light any fires 
michigan gov james j blanchard fulfilled his mission from party 
chief paul g kirk jr to produce a pithy platform devoid of 
troublesome special interest promises 
with a governor at the head of the ticket the party also was 
highlighting the accomplishments of blanchard who takes credit for 
helping revive michigans economy clinton a national leader of 
welfare and school improvement efforts louisianas reformminded 
buddy roemer and others 
a film aired at the convention said these governors exemplify 
a new approach to problem solving problemsolvers with an eye on 
the balance sheet 
the party has other stars already established including al gore 
and other alsorans in this years presidential contest and some 
of those considered presidential timber who chose not to run such 
as mario cuomo and bill bradley 
others already well established look to even larger roles down 
the road california rep tony coelho the party whip who had the 
convention chanting where was george even before sen edward 
m kennedy used the same line arkansas rep beryl f anthony 
chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee rep 
thomas foley of washington house majority leader and convention 
parliamentarian who is heir apparent to speaker jim wright rep 
bill gray of philadelphia chairman of the house budget committee 
and perhaps the countrys most powerful black officeholder and 
sen george mitchell of maine whose role in the irancontra 
hearings boosted his chances to succeed robert byrd as senate 
majority leader 
then for democraticminded americans with a small d who 
still love a political dynasty this convention had two young 
kennedys to offer 35yearold rep joseph p kennedy ii bobby 
kennedys oldest son a moviestar handsome figure roaming the 
floor posing for pictures with awestruck delegates and his 
cousin john f kennedy jr the 27yearold son of the late 
president the younger kennedy now a law student drew cheers from 
the delegates with his reference to his father so many of you 
came into public service because of him in a very real sense 
because of you he is still with us 
another potential dynasty in the making passed along this stage 
the children of jesse jackson including his oldest son jesse jr 
23 who proclaimed in a ringing voice those who say this is an 
age of cynicism and despair are wrong a new generation my 
generation is coming we have not given up the dream

thailand said wednesday it can no 
longer bear the burden of its cambodian refugees and threatened to 
move thousands to border camps within range of shelling unless 
western nations resettle them by aug 31 
the threat to move the refugees to the communist guerrillarun 
camps was announced by suvit suthanukul the secretarygeneral of 
the national security council the refugees are now housed at the 
khaoidang camp in thailand 
resettlement countries have known all along that thailand 
cannot bear the refugee burden indefinitely and we regard the aug 
31 dateline as an acceptable time frame under which all must 
quickly try to resettle the cambodians he said 
the khaoidang camp about eight miles from the cambodian 
border now shelters about 17000 people who fled the war in 
cambodia it is the only thai camp from which the cambodians can be 
resettled 
suvit said that starting sept 1 authorities will move any 
cambodians who have not been resettled to the site 2 camp next to 
the cambodian border suvit said the movement would be completed by 
the end of the year 
site 2 which houses 169000 people is the largest civilian 
camp run by the cambodian marxist guerrillas 
the camp is not far from the border and is still unsafe from 
border shellings suvit said 
western officials have opposed moving the refugees out of 
khaoidang the only refugee camp for cambodians not run by the 
khmer rouge guerrillas they say the new camp is too close to 
fighting between the cambodian rebels and vietnamese troops 
occupying their country 
a foreign ministry official kobsak chutikul said that 4000 
cambodians at khaoidang are likely to receive asylum by the aug 
31 deadline but many of the others have been rejected several 
times by resettlement countries he said 
the united states has accepted the largest number of cambodian 
refugees 
kobsak said the united nations is working on a program to find 
other solutions for the khaoidang refugees whom western countries 
are unwilling to resettle 
their future is their return to their homeland its time to 
puruse efforts in that direction he said

more than 500 physicians at the 
university of alabama at birmingham have spent 2 million to go 
into the hamburger business but they arent setting up a new 
practice 
the university of alabama health services foundation a 
nonprofit group of more than 500 doctors bought a wendys old 
fashioned hamburgers franchise near the uab campus because it wants 
the land to build an outpatient clinic said dick briggs jr 
acting president of the foundation 
the group purchased the land in march for 16 million and the 
hamburger franchise for 400000 the foundation has kept the 
restaurant operating because of a commitment not to have empty 
buildings while it waits for construction of the 1035 million 
clinic to begin briggs said 
but he said we dont have any longrange visions of 
making our fortunes in the burger business 
the foundation likely will sell the franchise rights rather than 
incorporating a wendys into the retail space that will be 
available in the new clinics parking deck after all he said 
it may be hard to push cholesterollowering diets in our building 
with a wendys next door

the environmental protection agency on 
wednesday delayed developing regulations for more controls on the 
leukemiacausing air pollutant benzene until it hears from the 
public on what is an acceptable environmental risk 
the approach the agency adopts for benzene one of the most 
widely used of all chemicals is expected to set the standard for 
agency rulings on acceptable levels of risk for dozens of other air 
pollutants 
one question is should we opt for additional controls that 
may be expensive but only buy society little additional 
reduction epa administrator lee m thomas said in a statement 
announcing the delay 
currently about 10 cases of leukemia occur in the general 
population every three years as a result of leaks from plant 
equipment and other exposure from making and using benzene the 
chemical is used in making gasoline plastics rubber artificial 
fibers and many other chemicals 
under the plans the epa is considering about one death every 
other year would result from benzene exposure 
environmentalists have sought standards that in effect would 
result in one death every 550 years the epa believes that such 
stringent standards would force massive plant closings and lead to 
the loss of thousands of jobs 
at issue in the matter is whether environmental risk should 
depend on where a person lives some analysts contend that society 
has already answered that question by refusing to allow such 
facilities as nuclear power plants to be built in urban areas but 
allowing them in the countryside 
with benzene the epa is trying to decide whether to rule that 
nobody living near industrial sources should face a lifetime risk 
greater than one in a million as the environmentalists argue or 
whether larger risks to individuals should be allowed when few 
people are exposed and the expected number of cancers is small 
the agency asked for maximum public comment on the 
sidetracked plan and three others in order of increasing 
stringency those others would 
limit annual cases of leukemia to one in the entire population 
this would mean little cost to industry 
limit the maximum likely risk to the most exposed individual to 
one in 10000 ignoring total cases 
limit the maximum likely risk to one in a million this the 
epa said could result in the closing of 131 chemical plants that 
couldnt control leaks and the loss of 35000 jobs plus the 
closing of 44 cokeoven byproduct recovery plants and the loss of 
7000 jobs 
david doniger an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said that he was gratified that the oneinamillion 
risk standard is under serious consideration and was almost 
certain that epa had greatly overestimated the costs of compliance 
he said it appeared the agency had not considered the ability of 
industry to pass on cost increases in prices and also that epa 
assumed all plants would have to reduce emissions by the same 
proportion as the dirtiest plants 
he said the epa also ignored the possibility that industry could 
develop new technologies to control benzene emissions 
the epas current benzene regulations which were adopted in 
1984 were challenged in court by doniger the agency had a court 
deadline to make a proposal by wednesday and a decision by december 
the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
said last year in a decision on another pollutant vinyl chloride 
that the epa must disregard all questions of costs in deciding 
acceptable risks but may consider costs and feasibility in 
deciding the ample margin of safety called for by the law 
the american petroleum institute said in a statement that the 
new proposal offered a good opportunity to develop a workable 
program in this area and that it hoped the epa would resist 
the unreasonable demands of environmental groups to adopt 
standards that are almost zerorisk

a new harder line shift in the 
leadership of the nicaraguan contras and a resulting split with 
their socalled southern front could be politically costly to 
the antisandinista rebels 
the alliance between the southern front and the principal contra 
coalition known as the nicaraguan resistance has always been 
fragile marred by frequent disputes and an almost constant lack of 
cooperation 
but the announcement of a break in that alliance tuesday night 
by seven southern front field commanders highlighted anew the 
growing turmoil within the contra organization brought about by 
last years congressional decision to end us aid 
ironically the new contra leadership disputes surfaced as the 
rebels appeared to have gained their best hope in months of winning 
renewed aid from a congress concerned over recent repressive acts 
by nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
its hard to say whos best at shooting themselves in the 
foot the sandinistas or the contras one western european 
diplomat observed wednesday they seem to trade political miscues 
as often as they trade bullets 
but the contras are not likely to win any converts with this 
political shakeup and their apparent drift to the right added 
the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity it could give 
some wavering congressmen especially democrats second thoughts 
the diplomat referred to an election in the dominican republic 
on monday night that gave enrique bermudez commander of the main 
rebel army known as the nicaraguan democratic front a seat on the 
contras sevenmember political directorate 
the general assembly of the nicaraguan resistance also dumped 
two of bermudezs most outspoken critics alfonso robelo and pedro 
joaquin chamorro leaving the military commander as the apparent 
first among equals on the policymaking board 
bermudez a former colonel in the national guard of ousted 
nicaraguan dictator anastasio somoza has long been a major point 
of friction among contra leaders some of whom like robelo are 
former sandinistas themselves and leery of a return to a 
militarydominated government 
at least five of the southern front field commanders who split 
away from the resistance because of bermudezs election also are 
former sandinistas they denounced his election as an attempt to 
gain control of the contra movement by the extreme right 
after being ousted from the directorate chamorro a former 
editor of the nicaraguan opposition daily newspaper la prensa 
accused the 50member general assembly of creating a military 
hegemony 
this effort to confuse the military and the civilian 
leadership brings back tragic memories from the past chamorro 
said in a clear reference to the 42year rule of the somoza family 
that was ended by the sandinistas in a popular revolution on july 
19 1979 
the southern front has fought the sandinista government along 
the nicaraguancosta rican frontier since 1983 when it was first 
formed under the name of the democratic revolutionary alliance by 
eden pastora another former sandinista guerrilla leader 
pastora whose nom de guerre was commander zero dropped out of 
the fight in 1986 but many of his field commanders continued the 
battle under the leadership of one of pastoras former chief 
lieutenants fernando el negro chamorro and a new name the 
opposition bloc of the south 
chamorro also gave up the fight last year and returned to 
managua but again many of the field commanders chose to fight 
on this time as the southern front under the leadership of pedro 
j lara another former sandinista known by his guerrilla name of 
ganso 
from the beginning the southern front guerrillas have received 
but a fraction of the us aid bestowed on the larger better known 
contra army commanded by bermudez and based in honduras although 
the southern front claims 2700 combatants most observers place 
its strength at no more than 500 men and it has not been known to 
have scored any significant military victories in recent years

some see jb mcnickles as a 6yearold con 
artist who assumed an alias outfitted himself for the part and 
eked out a sixday outing at an amusement park and salvation army 
camp in trendy malibu 
others say a somewhattimid jb wanted to go camping and when 
opportunity knocked he quietly answered 
police parents and the agencies involved say the whole incident 
should never have happened the boys foster parents believed he 
was missing and a massive search was launched 
odell williams jbs foster father dropped him off july 13 at 
the boys and girls club in pacoima he was not there a few hours 
later when edna williams arrived to pick him up 
while jb spent a day at knotts berry farm and five days at 
the salvation army camp police conducted doortodoor searches 
posted hundreds of pictures of the boy and alerted other 
jurisdictions about his disappearance 
these various agencies need to be alerted that their checks 
and balances didnt work and they got outsmarted by a 6yearold 
said police detective nancy lyon 
leroy chase director of the boys and girls club said jb 
boarded a van without the drivers notice 
i never had been to camp before jb explained i wanted 
to see what it was like 
the newly hired driver took the van full of kids to a salvation 
army pickup point 
he came from the boys club and we thought they knew their own 
kids said maj joe noland a salvation army spokesman 
i think there was one child who was a noshow but we had his 
application we think this kid jb assumed the identity of that 
child we think he answered to that name 
jb claims they asked me my name and i said jb 
mrs williams claims jb had no clothes but noland said he did 
but what about the permission slips i have had other foster 
kids go to the camp and they needed parents and doctors 
statements there is no excuse for this mrs williams contends 
the salvation army will try harder to make sure children match 
their applications noland vowed 
chase emphasized that the boys and girls club is not a child 
care center but a youth facility 
jb was returned home monday by a neighbor who spotted him back 
at the club 
he and his foster parents told reporters he had a good time 
although he got a little scared he told others the trip was 
nothing to write home about 
the scenery he said was junky just some mountains and he 
didnt care for the food i hated it i didnt eat any of it i 
didnt even touch it 
when he learned about the extensive search launched for him his 
main question was how much they spent looking for me a hundred 
thousand dollars maybe

republican illinois gov james r thompson 
considered a possible vice presidential pick for george bush said 
wednesday that he doesnt expect such an offer and doesnt know 
what hed say if he got it 
but thompson said that his moderate politics wouldnt disqualify 
him from a spot on the gop ticket 
i never thought moderation was a vice thompson said in an 
interview during a quick visit to atlanta to take part in a gop 
truth squad session giving the republican perspective on the 
democratic national convention 
im too moderate for some people but ive never been told im 
too moderate for george bush thompson said george bush and i 
agree on a lot of things 
he also said he thinks the countrys voters average out to be 
moderate so two moderates on a ticket would be electable 
when he was first elected in 1976 and again in 1978 the 
republican thompson was endorsed by jesse jackson the chicago 
democrat who now is part of what thompson branded a troika 
emerging as the 1988 democratic ticket he said that troika 
includes presidential candidate michael dukakis texas sen lloyd 
bentsen dukakis vicepresidential choice and jackson 
a lot of democrats have endorsed me and voted for me he 
said bob gibson the illinois state aflcio president and a 
delegate to this weeks democratic convention has endorsed 
thompson in the last two of his four elections 
a democratic legislature blocked thompsons bid for a 40 percent 
income tax increase in illinois he said his fight for the tax 
hike which he termed modest does not clash with bushs 
antitax talk 
i dont think theres any discrepancy between supporting a 
presidential candidate who says he doesnt want to raise taxes and 
pushing a modest tax increase in your own state thompson said 
he said bush believes in limiting federal taxes to give states more 
running room to fill their own financial needs 
the fourterm illinois governor who has held the post since 
1977 has the longest tenure in the job in state history 
thompson 52 said he does not expect bush to ask him to run 
because of the field of strong gop candidates available including 
kansas sen robert dole former transportation secretary elizabeth 
dole and new york rep jack kemp 
he said capability to be president shared philosophy and 
ability to carry out a strong campaign are should be key factors in 
bushs choice geography should be part of it but it should be 
the least part he said 
i dont really know what the job entails he added the 
popular wisdom is that youre the no 2 man he said but in the 
real world the presidents staff is the no 2 man the cabinet 
is the no 3 man and then the congress is no 4 man maybe 
george bush would rank his vice president higher than dukakis 
would i dont know 
he said bush is probably higher up the ladder on some issues 
in the reagan administration 
thompson said he would have to weigh a change in lifestyle that 
a vice presidency would bring to him and his family including wife 
jayne and 9yearold daughter samantha 
it would be in a different city and being vice president 
means you would be away probably more than as governor said 
thompson who lives with his family in a chicago home and also has 
living quarters in the governors mansion in springfield that 
would weigh heavily on me i think

the united states will mediate fourway talks 
in switzerland starting aug 2 aimed at working out a final 
agreement on the withdrawal of foreign forces from angola and on 
namibian independence from south africa it was announced wedneday 
assistant secretary of state chester crocker made the 
announcement after south africa cuba and angola the other 
participants in the talks gave final endorsement to a statement 
of principles governing future negotiations 
this is an important step we are not saying it is more than 
that crocker told a news conference there are a great many 
hard and difficult compromises to be achieved 
the statement of principles was worked out on a tentative basis 
last week during talks in new york but it left unresolved the 
thorny question of the timetables during which the withdrawals 
would take place this has emerged as the major area of 
disagreement among the parties 
aside from the timetable issue crocker said the statement of 
principles clears the way for the drafting of treaties discussions 
on verification of a final agreement and a process for the 
disengagement of forces 
the united states has been serving as mediator for the fourway 
talks which began in early may the previous rounds were held in 
london cairo and new york the switzerland talks will take place 
in geneva 
the administrations involvement in the issue dates back to 1981 
when crocker began pursuing a settlement that would lead to the 
withdrawal of cuban and south african forces from angola and south 
african consent to independence for namibia africas last colony 
the cubans have sent up to 15000 additional troops to angola 
since last fall but at the same time have shown a much greater 
willingness to work out an agreement on a total withdrawal a 
senior official said insisting on anonymity 
the cuban presence in angola is believed to number between 
47500 and 50000 forces there are believed to be several thousand 
south africa forces in angola supporting a usbacked insurgency 
the biggest remaining obstacle is a timetable for the mutual 
troop withdrawals 
under a united nations resolution the independence process in 
namibia would be carried out over a oneyear period once south 
africa consents to that step that timetable is considered 
nonnegotiable 
but south africa with us backing has said the south african 
withdrawal will not take place unless cuba agrees to withdraw its 
forces simultaneously 
in effect that appears to mean cuba would have to agree to 
roughly a oneyear withdrawal timetable or there is no agreement 
as an opening bargaining position cuba and angola have talked 
of a fouryear period for the cuban pullback but both sides have 
indicated flexibility on that point

a woman whose family abducted her from a 
convent says she wont go back and is glad her family cared enough 
about her to physically drag her away 
im not going to go back to a convent said mary susan 
greve the former sister mary cecelia people are saying live 
your own life well i am going to live my own life and im 
excited about it 
ms greve 22 of cincinnati says she wants to finish college 
to get the teaching degree she left halfcompleted when she joined 
the st joseph novitiate convent in roundtop ny 
members of her family were longtime followers of the convents 
spiritual leader the rev clarence kelly however they became 
disturbed at his conservative practices which were not sanctioned 
by the roman catholic church in rome and left his congregation 
they tried to persuade ms greve to leave 
the family said it resorted to abducting her june 26 after kelly 
allegedly kept them from communicating with her 
the church has said little since new york police dropped charges 
against the family 
kelly has maintained ms greve was brainwashed by her family 
into believing the convent was a cult 
ms greve discussed her decision tuesday during a taping of the 
phil donahue show kelly also appeared on the program 
the traditional religious order follows the teachings of the 
roman catholic church prior to vatican ii which gave bishops a 
greater influence in church affairs gave the laity a more active 
part in the liturgy and liberalized church positions with regard to 
noncatholic and nonchristian faiths

whats the best thing about a political 
convention not the drama certainly not this week not the food 
check back next month after new orleans its the shameless 
rhetorical excess 
and all of it this week directed at one man the man with one 
name george 
poor george that toothache of a man that hearnothing 
seenothing donothing vice president a man it has now been 
said too squeamish to bait his own hook 
in a spirit of generosity the democrats sometimes give george 
more than one name they give him the four he was born with as in 
george herbert walker bush of the kennebunkport bushes 
bush is the target of this attention by virtue of the fact that 
he is to be nominated next month by the republicans to stand 
against michael dukakis a democrat about whom not one humorous 
thing has been said this week at his convention in atlanta 
rhetorical excess is political mischiefmaking with a serious 
design a convention provides a fourday televised platform where a 
party will lay its record before the public and present its hopes 
and plans for the future on the less idealistic side the tv time 
can also be used to instill public doubt in the opposition 
so scorn has been heaped as high as an elephants eye here in 
atlanta as a score of prominent democrats have taken their best 
shot at the man who it has now been said probably wears argyle 
socks with his cowboy boots 
next month the republicans get their chance to take on dukakis 
but for now bush will have to hope his spokeswoman was right when 
she said in reaction to the notion that george was born with a 
silver foot in his mouth i dont think nastiness ever plays 
very well 
bush emerged from the wyoming wilderness wednesday and was 
quickly asked about the democratic criticism it might show a 
little desperation he said why dont they run on what theyre 
for why should i respond to a bunch of frantic namecallers 
the democrats are poking at bushs vulnerabilities not so much 
with nastiness as with sarcasm and ridicule 
it began monday night with the keynote speech by the 
sharptongued texas state treasurer ann richards 
for eight straight years george bush hasnt displayed the 
slightest interest in anything we care about she said and now 
that hes after a job he cant get appointed to hes like columbus 
discovering america hes found child care hes found education 
on tuesday rep tony coelho of california got things started 
followed in prime time by sen edward kennedy of massachusetts and 
texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower 
i know its not fair to criticize the vice president behind 
his back coelho said then proceeded to do just that hes 
fishing in wyoming all alone except for jim baker the treasury 
secretary is there coelho alleged in case george is too 
squeamish to bait his own hook 
then coelho began the where was george routine that pokes 
at bushs lack of identity in reagan administration matters 
when we sold arms to the ayatollah he asked where was 
george bush 
when edwin meese mocked the values we teach our kids where 
was goerge bush 
fact is for eight years nobody knows where george 
herbert hoover walker bush has been hes been silent invisible 
missing awol gone vanished 
kennedy made the chant a primetime highlight 
the vice president says he wasnt there or cant recall or 
never heard as the administration secretly plotted to sell arms to 
iran so when the monumental mistake was made i think its fair to 
ask where was george 
the vice president says he wasnt there or cant remember or 
didnt comprehend the intelligence report on general noreiga he 
said so when that report was being prepared and discussed i 
think its fair to ask where was george 
and so on until the crowd began answering for him and then 
repeated the chant without provocation where was george 
for antibush oneliners you had to like the speech by 
hightower a populist who likes to make fun of rich people 
after calling bush a toothache of a man he added his is 
an upperclass world in which wealth is given to you at birth he 
is a man who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple 
all that before the convention was half over next month will 
come bushs time for revenge

israeli defense officials warned on wednesday 
of the potential threat to israel of an iraqi army left idle after 
peace with iran but said the danger was not immediate 
if there is an eastern front of syria iraq and jordan with 
the assistance of saudi arabia the armored force facing israel 
will be equal to the number of tanks of all nato countries 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said on israel radio 
he noted that iraq has participated in every arab war against 
israel but said the danger of a new attack was not imminent 
because it probably would take another year or two for the persian 
gulf combatants to disentangle 
rabin also said that if arab leaders tried to use missiles 
equipped with chemical warheads against israel they will get it 
back hundredfold and more iraq and syria are known to have 
chemical weapons 
israeli defense officials said the size of iraqs military 
forces had grown from 300000 troops to 11 million since the war 
began in september 1980 the number of army divisions from 12 to 54 
and the armored strength from 4000 tanks to 6000 israel radio 
reported without identifying the officials 
it quoted them as saying iraq has about 560 jet fighters capable 
of flying longdistance missions

moslem pilgrims in the saudi arabian city 
of mecca on wednesday shouted death to the united states the 
soviet union and israel tehran radio reported 
the radio monitored in nicosia said the demonstration was in 
response to the call by imam khomeini 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini is the religious and revolutionary 
leader of iran 
tehran radio gave no source or further details in its report 
which was not confirmed from other sources 
the radio said the demonstration was carried out by moslem 
pilgrims in the midst of saudi security and police forces and close 
to the house of god a reference to the kaaba islams holiest 
shrine in central mecca 
saudi security forces have been on high alert to prevent 
incidents such as last years riot following an antiamerican 
antisaudi demonstration by fanatical iranian pilgrims in which 402 
persons died most of them iranians 
saudi arabia set a limit this year of one pilgrim per thousand 
population for each country iran is boycotting the pilgrimage in 
protest while continuing antisaudi invective calling the saudi 
royal family a us lackey and not fit to be custodian of the 
moslem holy places 
saudi interior minister prince nayef bin abdel aziz said a small 
number of iranians came for the pilgrimage among about 750000 
moslems from all over the world 
the prince said in an interview published wednesday that iran 
might take advantage of shiite moslems from other lands shiites 
are the majority sect in iran but a minority in the moslem world 
saudi security forces are vigilant and ready to confront any 
iranian plots he said

although battered by drought farmers 
collectively across the nation may wind up with about as much cash 
income in 1988 as last year when income was at a record level the 
agriculture department said wednesday 
although little overall change is expected in income regional 
disruptions are arising because income differs sharply among 
individual farmers from what it would have been with normal 
weather the departments economic research service said 
but the smaller droughtwithered crops and a sharp decrease in 
grain held in storage have boosted commodity prices usually by 
more than enough to offset reduced yields the agency said in its 
report 
this years cash receipts from sales are up because of 
higher crop values and sales from past years crops in storage at 
droughtincreased prices it said however farmers hit hardest 
by the weather are expected to have much lower receipts 
the economic report said that the rise in commodity prices may 
boost farmers gross cash income nationally to a range of 162 
billion to 167 billion in 1988 about 4 billion higher than 
projected last month nationally the gross was about 159 billion 
in 1987 
gross cash income includes proceeds from marketing and direct 
government payments when cash expenses are deducted what is left 
is called net cash income which was projected at 53 billion to 
59 billion for 1988 compared with the record of 56 billion in 
1987 
the agency also computes net farm income to include 
allowances for the value of goods consumed at home dwellings and 
changes in the value of inventories held by farmers 
on that basis this years net farm income could be in the range 
of 40 billion to 45 billion down from 42 billion to 48 billion 
forecast in june net farm income in 1987 was 46 billion 
officials said the decline to 1 billion to 6 billion from 
last year reflects the drop in 1988 production 
direct government payments to farmers including deficiency 
payments to crop producers are expected to decline this year to a 
range of 11 billion to 13 billion from a record of 17 billion 
in 1987 said economist richard kodl the higher market prices are 
trimming the subsidies 
but the biggest reduction will come in calendar 1989 kodl said 
that is because most of the payments for 1988 crops will go to 
farmers next year after the usda does the bookkeeping on how much 
will be due

fidel castro personally revoked the visa of rep 
dan mica dfla just hours before he was to fly to havana to 
inspect the us diplomatic post there for security breaches the 
congressman charged wednesday 
im convinced this had to be personally revoked by castro no 
desk officer would do this said mica a candidate for his 
partys nomination to fill the us senate seat being vacated by 
lawton chiles 
mica who is also chairman of the house subcommittee charged 
with overseeing safety and security at us embassies abroad said 
that he had never been denied entry to a country including 
communist countries 
this is a major violation of diplomatic protocol mica said 
he said that he and a crack team of congressional and us 
state department officials were specialists in securing us 
diplomatic posts 
the visas for the group were issued on july 14 he said cuban 
officials said that they were revoked to protest an american 
diplomats guest list for a party in havana on july 15 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said that cubas 
foreign minister isodoro malmierca called nonestablishment 
cubans who attended the party unacceptable human rights 
activists were among the party guests she said 
the us is protesting this incident which was a great 
discourtesy to a congressman and an example of cuban government 
intimidation of human rights activists she said 
mica said he had planned to investigate charges that security at 
the oceanfront us post in havana had been compromised he said 
the growing number of cuban employees 102 versus 26 americans 
was a potential threat to security 
we have to maintain a large support staff there were 
wondering if its too big and who is on it said robert k 
boyer a senior staff member of the house committee on foreign 
affairs 
mica said that he would also investigate allegations that us 
marines assigned to guard the post may have fraternized with cuban 
women compromising security 
a third concern is that an unspecified number of cubans 
reporting to us intelligence officials may be double agents and 
have been for up to 20 years mica said 
the congressman from lake worth insisted he had planned to 
maintain a low profile in cuba and had not sought media coverage of 
the trip until it was blocked

the reagan administration is trying to work 
out a cooperative approach with the soviet union in the struggle 
against drug traffickers the state department said wednesday 
the discussions began in moscow in april and both sides are 
currently evaluating potential productive areas for future 
cooperative activity phyllis oakley a department spokeswoman 
said 
these include soviet proposals to swap information on techniques 
for intercepting drug shipments and ways of identifying the source 
of narcotics through their signature catherine shaw a public 
information officer said 
the proposals are very very modest ms shaw said and 
reflect an admission but not the first by the soviets that they 
also have a drug problem 
john c lawn the us drug enforcement administrator will send 
a delegate to moscow for further discussions to pave the way for 
more formal talks in washington later in the year the us 
official said 
we are evaluating various proposals and we simply do not have 
any definitive word on what those proposals are right now mrs 
oakley said 
the us official said cooperation in the fight against 
narcotics was a potentially fruitful area for improved bilateral 
cooperation

navajo judges and lawyers boycotted a 
us civil rights commission hearing wednesday contending 
commission subpoenas illegally infringed on tribal sovereignty 
a commission subcommittee is holding hearings to determine if 
federal courts should be allowed to enforce civil rights laws on 
indian reservations wednesdays session was to examine what impact 
a dispute between the current and former heads of the tribe is 
having on the navajo judiciary 
the commission lacked authority to even inquire about tribal 
court enforcement of the federal indian civil rights act because a 
1978 us supreme court decision gives tribal courts final say on 
the law said david nash an attorney for the tribe 
the subpoenas demonstrate an appalling disregard for the 
integrity of the navajo tribal court system and attorneyclient 
privilege navajo attorney general michael upshaw added in a 
written submission 
we resent the commissions intrusion into a tribal judicial 
proceeding and its attempt to require us to relitigate the case 
before the commission particularly while it is pending before the 
navajo courts he said 
commission chairman william allen said a decision would be made 
later on how to enforce the subpoenas 
the dispute began earlier this year when tribal chairman peter 
macdonald sought control over the navajo education and scholarship 
foundation which former chairman peterson zah believed he had been 
given authority over 
zah locked out of his office got a tribal judge to issue an 
order barring his eviction the tribe got another judge and police 
shut down the entire building 
brian miller the commissions deputy general counsel said his 
agencys interest was not one of merits and not one of who is 
right and who is wrong but one of due process and civil rights 
allen said the subcommittee was holding the hearings because the 
supreme court ruled in 1978 that tribal enforcement of the indian 
civil rights act was not subject to federal court review 
commission staff has received allegations that the 
independence of the judiciary of the navajo nation has been 
recently threatened he said 
part of the courts reasoning was that tribal forums are 
available to vindicate rights created by the icra allen said 
put simply the question this subcommittee has been examining is 
whether the courts assumption is true 
the commission also discussed adoption cases involving indian 
children 
relatives attorneys social workers and wouldbe adoptive 
parents in cases involving the navajo and white mountain apache 
tribes were called to testify 
the indian child welfare act passed by congress gives tribes 
exclusive control over adoption in cases where the mother is living 
on the reservation 
the law stemmed from repeated complaints from tribal members 
that nonindian courts were too quick to allow nonindians to adopt 
an indian child 
but the commission wanted to see whether the rights given to the 
tribe as a whole infringed on the rights of the individual parties 
one case gained national attention recently when rick and cheryl 
pitts a san jose calif couple obtained a baby from a navajo 
woman outside the reservation 
the tribal court demanded jurisdiction from a california court

president mohammad zia ulhaq 
announced on wednesday that elections will be held on nov 16 but 
the opposition demanded august elections and called his action a 
delaying tactic and unconstitutional 
gen zia said in an address to the senate that the elections 
will be for both the national assembly and for the four state 
legislatures of punjab sind baluchistan and the north west 
frontier 
his foes insisted that under pakistans constitution polling 
must take place by aug 27 when a 90day deadline expires 
following zias may 29 dissolution of the national assembly 
the assembly and the senate comprise the federal legislature 
zia said election arrangements cannot be completed before 
november 
benazir bhutto head of the strongest opposition group the 
pakistans peoples party called zias decision yet another 
attempt to subvert the constitution and the political process of 
transfer of power 
she said zia would never have announced any poll date had it not 
been for the opposition 
bhuttos father zulfikar ali bhutto was overthrown as prime 
minister by zia in a 1977 military coup and was hanged in 1979 
after conviction on a conspiracy to murder charge in a 
controversial trial 
zia dismissed prime minister mohammad khan junejo the national 
assembly and four state legislatures in may accusing them of 
corruption incompetence and failure to islamize pakistan and 
prevent a breakdown of law and order 
junejo denied the charges and accused zia of violating the 
constitution by arbitrarily dissolving the assembly and 
disrupting a democratic system which was operating smoothly 
the former premier told a news conference wednesday the 
constitution clearly demands elections within 90 days after the 
dissolution of the assembly we need elections straight away nov 
16 is very late 
he said his pakistan moslem league party had already 
established a committee of constitutional experts to examine 
whether to challenge the delay in court as well as the legality 
of disolving the assembly 
former air marshal asghar khan president of the centrist 
tehrileistiklal movement for solidarity said 
we wanted these elections to be held within 90 days his 
zias credibility is already low what is going to happen between 
now and november and whether polls will in fact take place no 
one knows

south africa angola and cuba 
formally accepted an agreement wednesday that is intended to get 
foreign troops out of angola and grant independence to southwest 
africa 
there is a general consensus that no one should come out a 
loser everyone can come out winners if we can achieve peace in the 
region foreign minister roelof f botha told a news conference 
a similar announcement accepting the 14point principles for a 
peaceful settlement in southwestern africa was made in luanda 
angola the cuban news agency prensa latina monitored in mexico 
city said fidel castros government had accepted it 
the official angolan news agency angop carried a transcript in 
portuguese of the government statement 
roland darroll of the south african foreign ministry said the 
next round of talks will be held aug 24 in geneva 
we offered south africa as the next venue and we are still 
offering for the following talks because we believe africa is the 
appropriate place to hold talks on an african problem but we 
accepted the swiss offer he said 
in washington assistant secretary of state chester crocker 
said this is an important step we are not saying it is more 
than that there are a great many hard and difficult compromises to 
be achieved 
the united states mediates the talks which began in may and led 
to agreement in principle last week in new york other rounds were 
held in london and cairo with angolansouth african talks in 
brazzaville congo 
major obstacles remain to implementation of the peace plan 
which says nothing of timetables for cuban and south african troop 
withdrawal from angola cutoffs of soviet us and south african 
military aid to the warring parties or settlement of the civil war 
further agreements are envisaged in these principles botha 
said we have traveled a long distance to get to this stage but 
we are only at the foot of the mountain the road ahead is steep 
full of potholes and dangerous curves 
the principles call for implementation of 1978 un security 
council resolution 435 which provides for unmediated elections 
in southwest africa after south african withdrawal from the 
territory it has ruled for 73 years 
an important step in the negotiating process was agreement by 
angola and cuba that independence for southwest africa also 
called namibia should be linked to the withdrawal of an estimated 
50000 cubans from neighboring angola 
the principles call for a movement of an estimated 15000 cubans 
northward from the border area where they have recently deployed 
and battled with south african troops inside angola 
a major obstacle to implementation of the peace plan is the 
absence of agreement on timetables for the withdrawals 
south africa and the united states want the cuban withdrawal 
from angola to dovetail with the south african withdrawal from 
namibia anticipated at one year under the un resolution cuba 
and angola have said it would take four years for the cubans to 
leave 
also not addressed in the principles is the status of the 
indigenous warring parties and guerrilla organizations south 
african troops have fought inside angola in support of the 
antimarxist national union for the total independence of angola 
or unita also aided by us weapons and supplies 
south africa says angola allows the african national congress 
which is waging a sabotage campaign against white rule in south 
africa to maintain guerrilla training bases in angola 
also the military wing of the southwest african peoples 
organization or swapo has its bases in southern angola where 
they have recently been protected by the cuban forces from 
crossborder retaliation for bombings and attacks on south african 
forces in namibia 
america south africa the soviet union cuba and several 
eastern bloc nations give military aid to one side or the other in 
the conflicts and that issue has also not been addressed 
just as this is not the stage to approach angola on the issue 
of their support to the anc this is also not the stage to address 
the question of our aid to unita botha said 
negotiators have indicated that the dispute between the luanda 
government and unita is regarded as an internal one for angolans to 
settle once the foreigners leave the country 
no specific reference was made to when south africa would pull 
its estimated 3000 troops out of angola and botha refused to 
comment on the question of a ceasefire or unilateral withdrawal 
we believe it the agreement will lead to a lessening of 
tensions botha said 
hidipo hamutenya information secretary for swapo was 
optimistic about the implications of the agreement 
when all the elements are in place we expect south africa and 
swapo to hold direct talks and reach a ceasefire agreement as a 
first step towards the implementation of un security council 
resolution 435 hamutenya said in a cable interview from luanda 
with aim the mozambican national news agency 
hamutenya said it stands to reason that progress is being 
made and the prospects for a comprehensive settlement of the 
conflict in the southwestern corner of africa are reasonably 
bright 
the principles also call for all states to recognize the 
integrity and inviolability of borders noninterference in the 
affairs of other states abstention from threats or use of force 
against the territorial integrity or independence of other states 
responsibility of states not to allow their territory to be used 
for acts of war or agression against another

sentencing of a former state highway patrolman 
convicted of a motorists murder was delayed wednesday to allow the 
defense to appeal one aspect of the case but the judge refused to 
grant a new trial 
superior court judge richard huffman postponed until aug 3 the 
sentencing of craig peyer 38 who was convicted in his second 
trial of firstdegree murder in the strangulation of a san diego 
state university student 
peyers first trial ended in a deadlocked jury in february 
huffman said the postponement gives the defense time to seek 
appellate review of a ruling monday in which he said a reporter 
didnt have to answer questions about how he obtained results of 
the defendants liedetector test 
the judge rejected all other elements in a defense motion 
seeking a new trial for the former california highway patrol 
officer as well as a motion to reduce the jurys firstdegree 
murder finding to seconddegree murder 
huffman said he rejected the argument by defense attorneys 
robert grimes and diane campbell that the killing may have been an 
impulsive act 
he said the evidence supported the jurys finding that the dec 
27 1986 strangulation of cara knott 20 involved premeditation 
knott was driving from escondido to her el cajon home when she was 
stopped and directed down an isolated ramp of interstate 15 and 
then killed 
mr peyer had to get a rope huffman said theres no 
reason in this evidence to make me believe that he walked around 
with a rope attached to his belt he had to engage in a conscious 
decision finding that rope and wrap it around that youngsters 
neck 
as part of their motion for new trial the attorneys claimed 
huffman erred in several evidentiary rulings involving the 
exclusion of potential defense witnesses and the limiting of 
testimony by other witnesses but huffman said all of his rulings 
were justified 
however the judge admitted he shared the defenses concerns 
about the publication of peyers liedetector test the test which 
is inadmissible as evidence reportedly showed peyer attempted 
deception when questioned about knotts death after his arrest 
grimes and campbell argued the publication of the polygraph 
information may have affected peyers right to a fair trial 
the attorneys also said the information may have been leaked to 
san diego union reporter jim okerblom by police or a member of the 
prosecution 
huffman has said that if that proves to be the case he would 
have to consider granting peyer a new trial or dismissing the 
charge altogether on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct 
okerbloms story appeared in the union during jury selection for 
peyers second trial it prompted unusually extensive jury 
questioning 
okerblom was called to the witness stand monday but cited 
constitutional protections and the states shield law in refusing 
to answer questions about the polygraph material mailed to the 
union anonymously 
the shield law prohibits the states judges from holding a 
reporter in contempt for refusing to identify anonymous sources 
grimes said he would petition the 4th district court of appeal 
to determine the applicability of the shield law in the peyer case

the federal communications commission approved 
the sale of two broadcast stations owned by rko and took a major 
step in resolving a legal dispute that has lasted more than two 
decades 
the fcc approved a settlement agreement calling for rko a 
subsidiary of gencorp to sell khjtv in los angeles and whbqam 
radio in memphis tenn 
the los angeles television station is being sold to walt disney 
co and 70 percent of the memphis radio station is being sold to 
flinn broadcasting corp 
the approval will put the stations in the hands of 
indisputably qualified licensees and avoid countless years of 
continued litigation before the fcc and the courts the 
commission said 
gencorp rkos parent company two years ago announced its 
desire to get out of the broadcasting business but its attempt to 
sell its stations have been locked in a legal dispute over whether 
rko actually should have the broadcast licenses involved 
a legal battle dating back to 1965 revolves around the fitness 
of rko to operate the broadcast stations the fcc in 1980 refused 
to renew rkos license for wnactv in boston saying the company 
was unqualified to run the station 
since then rkos licenses in other cities have been under 
challenge 
in approving the proposed sale of the los angeles television 
station and the memphis radio station the fcc said the 
commission concluded that strong public interest considerations 
favored settling these two cases which are part of the most 
burdensome proceedings in the fccs history 
gen corp which is based in akron ohio said in a statement 
that it welcomed the fccs decision and that it hoped it would 
serve as a model in the sale of rkos other broadcast stations 
this marks a giant step toward a constructive resolution of 23 
years of litigation involving the rko licenses said gencorp 
chairman a william reynolds 
under the agreement rko receives roughly twothirds of the 
revenue from the sale of khjtv in los angeles and whbq radio in 
memphis with competing applicants receiving onethird 
in the case of khjtv walt disney co will pay rko 2186 
million and pay a competing license applicant fidelity television 
inc 1054 million fidelity ultimately is to be merged into a 
subsidiary of disney 
in the case of whbq in memphis flinn broadcasting will pay rko 
525000 and pay a competing license applicant first city

president corazon aquino has the 
right to allow usnuclear weapons in the country despite a 
constitutional provision against such arms her justice secretary 
said in an opinion released wednesday 
the legal opinion set the stage for a confrontation between mrs 
aquino and filipino legislators many of whom oppose the presence 
of both nuclear weapons and us military bases 
in the 19yearold war with rebels authorities said at least 17 
people were killed in the previous 48 hours in several clashes 
across the archipelago 
justice secretary sedfrey ordonez said in a fourpage opinion 
the constitutional provision against nuclear weapons must be 
viewed as an instrument rather than an objective in 
treatymaking if such a policy is not in keeping with the national 
interest of the philippines the president may defer from it 
the 1986 constitution written by a commission mrs aquino 
appointed says the nation consistent with the national 
interest adopts and pursues a policy of freedom from nuclear 
weapons in its territory 
last month the senate overwhelmingly approved a bill banning 
nuclear weapons a similar bill is pending in the house of 
representatives 
the united states refuses to confirm or deny whether keeping 
such weapons at its six bases in the philippines 
in april the united states and the philippines began a review 
of the 1947 military bases agreement whose current term expires in 
1991 
it is my opinion that the president of the philippines may 
negotiate a modification or extension of the military bases 
agreement with the us regardless of the provisions therein 
pertaining to nuclear weapons ordonez said in his opinion 
he presented it tuesday to a closed meeting of a 
legislativeexecutive panel advising filipino negotiators in the 
bases negotiations 
his decision means mrs aquino ultimately may have to decide 
either to permit nuclear weapons in the face of growing opposition 
or risk a confrontation with the united states 
washington is her governments major source of military and 
economic aid the united states provides 180 million annually in 
economic and military aid in exchange for the bases but the 
philippine demands have ranged to more than 12 billion 
us officials have said they accept the constitutional 
provision but oppose the senate bill which they claim would 
cripple military operations at subic bay naval base clark air base 
and four smaller facilities 
sen wigberto tanada chief sponsor of the antinuclear bill and 
a prominent opponent of the bases said the ordonez opinion gives 
the president the unconscionable option which is not hers to risk 
the lives property and future of our people and our country 
majority floor leader orlando mercado who supported the bill 
told reporters the opinion was not binding on the legislature and 
the supreme court might ultimately decide the meaning of the 
constitutional provision 
in a report on the war press secretary teodoro benigno quoted a 
military report as saying at least 1934 people 483 civilians 
904 rebels and 547 police and soldiers had been killed in the 
first half of 1988 
the report was issued two days after leaders of the new peoples 
army the communist rebel group that began fighting in 1969 
rejected a call by the nations roman catholic bishops for 
resumption of peace talks which broke down in february 1987

the other day a friend of mine back home asked me if i were 
really excited about the prospect of michael dukakis becoming 
president when i said i was he said bill i can understand why 
you think he should be president but how can you get excited about 
a guy whos so clean he squeaks when he walks and who mows his yard 
with a handpowered mower 
well i thought about it and i decided thats one reason i was 
excited 
hes oldfashioned all right hes the kind of man who plays it 
straight keeps his word and pays his bills 
in arkansas we say hes the kind of man you can tie to 
dont misunderstand me hes not perfect i have to confess 
right here in the omni home of the atlanta hawks that he loves 
the boston celtics during the playoffs he even watched them while 
making campaign phone calls 
still i think michael dukakis should be president because he 
has the character the record and the vision america needs at this 
moment in our journey and michael dukakis should be president 
because he is the right man for our times 
his character is steadfast and consistent he wakes up in the 
same world every day a trait of no small importance in a president 
i have found him selfconfident but willing to listen to other 
people thats a lesson he and i learned the hard way we got beat 
over the head with it both of us were elected defeated then 
given a rare second chance by our people that does wonders for 
your sensitivity to others and their views 
mike and i met after our defeats he was teaching at the kennedy 
school and i was the youngest exgovernor in american history i 
was struck even then by his lack of bitterness his eagerness to 
learn and his continuing genuine commitment to public life in or 
out of office 
as someone whos worked with him on hard issues in the national 
governors association whos hammered out compromises with him 
disagreed with him and fought battles by his side i can tell you 
one thing when he needs to be michael dukakis is tough as nails 
of course if he hadnt been tough he never could have come 
back from his defeat when that happens to most people they pull 
the shades rip the phone off the wall and pack it in not mike 
dukakis he hangs in there

the security council unanimously adopted a 
mild resolution on wednesday expressing deep distress over the 
us downing of an iranian airliner which killed 290 people 
the council also urged that a un ceasefire and peace plan 
quickly be put into effect in the iraniraq war which began in 
september 1980 
after days of negotiations the 15member council adopted a 
watereddown document that would satisfy both america and iran and 
not provoke a us veto 
but iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati later told 
reporters i am not satisfied we expected the resolution would 
play a more important role in bringing security to civil aviation 
he added there were some positive elements in the 
resolution citing the call for stricter observance of 
international regulations on safety of civil aviation 
mahallati also objected to the us offer of compensation to 
families of the victims of airliner incident the united states has 
said no payment will go to tehran with which it has no diplomatic 
relations 
the united states is obliged to pay compensations not only to 
the families but to the government mahallati said in answer to a 
question i dont think we shall accept anything which is below 
what the united states is obliged to do 
he said that if the united states fails to pay tehran there 
are other measures the united nations should consider 
it could take the case to the international court of justice 
the uss vincennes shot down the iran air airbus over the persian 
gulf on july 3 the united states said the missile cruiser mistook 
the passenger jet for an attacking iranian warplane 
the security council action came one year to the day after it 
unanimously adopted resolution 598 demanding an immediate 
ceasefire and troop withdrawal in the iraniraq war 
iran had requested the council session after boycotting the body 
for eight years it returned to urge condemnation of the downing of 
the airliner and demand withdrawal of all us forces from the 
waterway 
but iran was unable to muster enough votes to condemn the united 
states 
us ambassador vernon a walters said the resolution puts the 
airbus disaster in proper perspective and said the conflict in 
the gulf must end he told the council the airbus accident is 
only part of a much larger human tragedy the iraniraq war 
he said the united states welcomes irans announcement that it 
fully accepts resolution 598 and said now a large obstacle has 
been overcome 
walters said we intend to stick with our effective gulf 
policy once tensions decrease and the treat to western 
interests dissipates then the level of our naval presence will 
naturally be reduced 
he said the us naval presence is a force for peace in 
support of regional states whose interests and those of the west 
face a very real threat 
diplomats said the council deleted controversial passages to 
ensure passage of the brief resolution it erased a sentence 
proposed by iran calling on foreign naval forces to reassess their 
presence in the gulf and eliminated a us call for freedom of 
navigation it deleted strong language of condemnation to avoid a 
us veto 
the resolution said the council expresses its deep distress at 
the downing of an iranian civil aircraft by a missile fired from a 
us warship and profound regret over the tragic loss of innocent 
lives 
it urged all parties to the chicago convention of 1944 on 
international civil aviation to fully observe all rules and 
practices concerning safety of civilian aircraft 
the resolution also said the council stresses the need for a 
full and rapid implementation of its resolution 598 of 1987 as the 
only basis for a comprehensive just honorable and durable 
settlement of the conflict between iran and iraq 
it reaffirmed support for secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar in implementating the resolution which calls for a 
ceasefire troop withdrawal prisoner exchange impartial body to 
determine the aggressor and a comprehensive peace settlement 
council members are the united states the soviet union 
britain france and china the five permanent members with veto 
power and algeria argentina brazil italy japan nepal 
senegal west germany yugoslavia and zambia

welfare reform program et has been a model for the national 
welfare reform effort for one simple reason it has taken people 
off of welfare rolls and put them on payrolls

a deaf church janitor who was more 
at ease with kids than with adults was arraigned wednesday on 
charges of kidnapping three young girls and keeping one in a dirt 
crawl space for as long as six weeks 
kenneth alvin michel 32 did not enter a plea after municipal 
court judge john stroud advised him of the charges and appointed a 
public defender to represent him 
michel using sign language and head nods to speak through an 
interpreter said he had only 1400 to pay legal fees 
the judge set bail at 1 million and said he would consider a 
motion by the district attorneys office to deny bail at an aug 9 
hearing 
deputy district attorney ken peterson said michel could face 
more than 35 years in prison if convicted he said his office was 
still evaluating evidence to determine whether to file additional 
charges 
michel was arrested monday at the united methodist church in 
suburban elk grove where he was a parttime custodian police said 
they traced the license plate on a car that was allegedly involved 
in a kidnapping incident earlier in the day 
officers found two missing girls at the church fiveyearold 
muey han saefong was kidnapped monday in sacramento and was found 
in the back of michels car her mouth taped and legs bound police 
said 
fouryearold candi talarico who was kidnapped june 4 while 
playing outside her apartment was found in an lshaped space under 
the altar police said 
officers said the space had a dirt floor concrete walls and a 
wooden ceiling it was furnished with blankets stuffed animals 
books food lights a television and newspapers that contained 
articles about the kidnapping which was featured on fox 
broadcasting cos americas most wanted tv program 
muey and candi were examined at a hospital after their rescue 
and returned to their parents 
at a news conference tuesday the churchs pastor linda inlow 
said it was doubtful anyone would have heard candi if she had 
yelled for help 
she said that candi was kept in a 7by9by3 foot space under a 
crawl space floor she said michel apparently cut a hole in the 
floor to gain access to another space that extended three or four 
more feet below 
friends and relatives have described michel as a gentle man who 
loved children but was lonely and had trouble communicating because 
of a speech handicap 
he was very very protective of kids said hf frost who 
lived next door for several years if one of my grandkids got out 
in the street hed run out and grab them he was more at ease with 
kids than with adults he took to them he played with them by the 
hour 
the rev david delaplane an adviser to inlow said michel was 
placed on leave of absence last spring by a day care center where 
he also worked 
delaplane said that some children had teased michel because of 
his disabilities and that michel reacted out of frustration and 
pinched them the day care center leased space from the church 
michel is accused of kidnapping muey candi and 6yearold daisy 
jones who was abducted monday morning in elk grove but escaped 
moments later peterson said prosecutors felt daisy had been in 
michels possession long enough to warrant filing charges of 
kidnapping instead of attempted kidnapping 
sgt bob burns said a witness got the license number of the car 
used the witness said he was driving to work when saw a man 
running down a busy street with a screaming child in his arms the 
girl broke free

the car was parked outside his house at the time it was taken 
ms goff said jacobs was not supposed to be in the area around the 
house and that officials were alarmed by the discovery that he has 
a weapon 
were really really concerned about that she said 
jacobs had been in jail since he was 25 when he was sentenced 
to life in prison for killing a police officer in logan county in 
1962 he was classified as a minimumsecurity prisoner ms goff 
said which means he was allowed to work unsupervised on the 
prisons honor farm outside the prison compound 
he was a minimumsecurity prisoner so he was obviously not 
considered a real threat said ms goff but any escaped felon 
should be considered dangerous

soviet inspectors counted us 
nuclear missiles in britain wednesday under the historic superpower 
treaty to eliminate an entire class of such weapons but they want 
to see the tower of london too 
at the beginning of the inspection they requested a 
sightseeing visit to london defense ministry spokesman martin 
helm said wednesday 
clearly theres no provision in the inf intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty for the inspectors and air crew to move off 
base but we will be pleased to arrange a trip to make the visit 
enjoyable he added 
so thursday will be sightseeing day for the 20 soviet 
inspectors 
the inspectors flew in tuesday from moscow to make their checks 
at greenham common airbase 50 miles west of london and at 
britains other cruise missile base molesworth near cambridge 
both bases are run by the us military 
the checks are part of a 60day period of inspections that 
started july 1 to verify whether each side told the truth about 
deployments the soviets are visiting 30 sites in the united states 
and five western european countries us inspectors are visiting 
133 sites in the soviet union and eastern europe no violations 
have been reported thus far 
a group of 20 us missile experts on wednesday ended their 
inspections of installations in east germany the official east 
german news agency adn said 
it said the americans split into two groups to inspect four 
former soviet missile sites in waren bischofswerda wokul and 
koenigsbrueck east germany 
also wednesday the official czechoslovak news agency ctk said 
the government granted permission for us experts to inspect a 
former missile base at hranice central czechoslovakia under the 
inf treaty it said the 10 americans will arrive thursday 
the inf treaty signed in december provides for elimination 
within three years of all landbased missiles in europe with ranges 
of 300 to 3000 miles the soviet inspectors began their checks in 
britain at noon wednesday splitting up into two teams to visit 
both bases 
under the ussoviet treaty which provided for unprecedented 
review of each others facilities each inspection can last up to 
24 hours with a possible eighthour extension 
the soviets who gave the required 16 hours notice of arrival 
and declared formally wednesday morning what they wanted to see 
may take four hours to write their reports after inspections 
the inspections at greenham common with 96 working missiles 
and molesworth with 16 are the first in britain 
the groundhugging difficulttodetect cruise missiles which 
provide a vehicle for the warheads and their 55foot mobile 
launchers are housed in bunkers the soviets will not see the 
warheads which carry the explosive material because the warheads 
do not have to be destroyed under the treaty 
the soviet inspectors were staying in specially converted 
barracks 
entertainment to date consisted of a bus tour of the greenham 
base tuesday evening and a visit to an onbase gift shop the us 
military said 
but on thursday after being cooped up under tight security with 
geiger counters tape measures missiles and mobile launchers the 
soviets will do some fancy sightseeing 
the defense ministry said that among the tourist attractions the 
soviets will view is the royal tournament held each summer at the 
earls court exhibition center in west london a spectacular 
display by britains armed forces of massed bands gymnastics and 
showjumping 
us and british military officers will accompany them 
the soviet inspectors were expected to return to greenham for 
the night before leaving friday officials said

but at this time in our history michael dukakis is the man for 
america 
the postworld war ii era when america dominated the world 
economically politically and militarily is over for the rest of 
our lives we will have to compete with people in other countries 
for new jobs new business opportunities and technological 
breakthroughs as we have learned painfully in the last decade we 
wont win if were not prepared 
the republicans main claim to the white house this year is that 
in the face of competition and adversity the administration 
produced a fiveyear recovery well that recovery left a lot of 
people and places behind was financed by a sea of borrowed money 
and ignored or aggravated some harsh realities the rise of huge 
budget and trade deficits the loss of our competitive position in 
lowwage lowskill and import sensitive industries in 
agriculture energy and mining and in some hightech areas too 
the growth of a vast new class of poor people most of them young 
women and their little children an epidemic of social problems 
and a decline in real wages 
left unattended these difficulties could threaten not only our 
childrens future but our own 
in the first half of the 1980s for the first time in my 
lifetime only 40 percent of our people had an increase in their 
incomes while 20 percent stood still and 40 percent actually 
suffered a reduction in real wages we used to believe a rising 
economic tide lifts all boats todays tide is drowning four in 10 
of our people who have fallen off the boat and the republican crew 
wont even throw a life raft to the women and children 
there are those who see these developments as evidence that our 
nation is in decline bestselling books predict a downhill slide 
that we either cannot or will not stop 
michael dukakis doesnt believe that for a minute he believes 
americas best days lie ahead he reminds us that weve faced even 
greater challenges in the past he is an apostle of hope 
last night when jesse jackson gave that awesome wonderful 
speech many of you waved signs with his slogan keep hope 
alive in his own way mike dukakis will never let us forget that 
admonition we all must be apostles of hope as the scripture says 
let us not grow weary in doing good for in due season we shall 
reap if we do not lose heart

michael dukakis is a builder who wants to build a bridge to 
tomorrow strong enough to carry our heaviest load wide enough for 
all of us to walk across together long enough to take us into the 
2lst century 
hes got a big job to do and we have to help him his economic 
challenge is to reduce our debt to nourish our entrepreneurs and 
small business people who create most of our jobs to promote new 
relationships between business and labor in which risk loss and 
gain are shared to reduce the scandalous waste of money consumed 
by hostile mergers and takeovers that cost jobs to get much more 
cooperation from our major competitors in europe and japan in 
making economic and defense policies to fight for a fair trading 
system that gives us the chance to sell more as well as buy more 
and to reduce the debt of the developing nations in latin america 
whose futures are so tightly bound to our own 
this is an ambitious agenda but michael dukakis has great 
ambitions for america 
yet even if he carries it off america still could be in 
trouble 
why because compared to all the worlds major economic powers 
we do the worst job of developing our most precious resource our 
people 
we let more babies die than others do a child born in costa 
rica has a better chance of living to be a year old than one born 
tonight in our nations capital 
we stand by while more of our children have children than others 
do swelling the number of our truly disadvantaged 
we accept far more adult illiteracy than others do though we 
know 80 percent of the work force in the year 2000 will be composed 
of people who are already working and that sooner or later our 
workers inability to read will catch up with them and catch up 
with us 
we tolerate more homeless children than others do degrading the 
most blameless among us 
we live in the only advanced country thats still in the dark 
ages when it comes to child care 
our school dropout rates are more than twice those of our major 
competitors

recent thundershowers in the midwest have dropped muchneeded 
rain on thirsty crops but officials said wednesday the rainfall 
hasnt signaled the end of the drought or the end of the crisis for 
cornfields 
the benefits of an inch of rain will be shortlived if hot dry 
weather returns and it will the national weather service says 
the agencys 30day outlook for the midwest calls for abovenormal 
temperatures with belownormal rainfall 
inptte meantime some farmers fortunate enough to have received 
some relief were happy 
its a godsend said herman krone whose 2800acre southern 
illinois farm visited last week by president reagan was drenched 
by more than 3 inches of rain in 24 hours 
its really helped said donald hegeman who farms about 700 
acres near cosby mo pessimism turns to optimism with every drop 
of rain he added 
in kentucky this weeks rainfall has helped recharge ponds 
streams and rivers said mike callahan a hydrologist with the 
national weather service in louisville 
the ohio river is actually starting to come up now he said 
but not everyone has been so lucky 
i cant even remember the last rain said a discouraged 
sonny wiederkehr a texas rancher with 3000 acres in duval and 
mcmullen counties also parched by drought 
it looks like the pavement nothing there he said of his 
pastures 
for many droughtstricken cornfields the rain comes too late 
experts say 
every little drop is good news said al almy of the michigan 
farm bureau 
but even if we get sufficient rainfall now were still past 
the point of no return the damage has been done almy said 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration said 
wednesday higherthannormal rain is expected over the next five 
days for the atlantic and gulf coast states and the region 
comprising tennessee kentucky west virginia and southern ohio 
the weather is expected to be drierthan normal in the area from 
michigan and wisconsin stretching southwest across the cornbelt 
states to kansas oklahoma and north texas 
in pennsylvania farmers and agriculture officials said the 
recent rainfall although helpful isnt enough to reverse effects 
of the drought some areas are more than 10 inches below normal 
levels according to susan woods a spokeswoman for the department 
of environmental resources 
the scattered rainfall generally ranging from 1 to 2 inches in 
the midwest has helped some crops including soybeans agriculture 
experts said 
but severe damage to corn cant be reversed they said since 
that crop was stricken by drought at a critical point in its 
development 
most of the early corn is in bad shape and unlikely to respond 
to any amount of rain said tom womack of the tennessee 
department of agriculture 
but there are still a lot of crops out there that arent yet 
developed as long as we get showers every week through the growing 
season we should have decent yields of soybeans tobacco and 
cotton 
wednesdays rainfall doesnt mean the droughts over with of 
course because weve got a big rain deficit said meteorologist 
john wright of the national weather services midwest agricultural 
weather service center at purdue university in indiana 
in illinois for example a normal statewide average of rainfall 
for this time of year is about 21 inches said wayne wendland of 
the illinois state water survey 
but illinois has only received between 11 and 15 inches this 
year he said 
the only community in the midwest that has recorded normal 
rainfall is the tiny town of iuka in southern illinois wendland 
said 
they caught up two weeks ago when 4 inches fell in one day

when our kids do get out of school they have about two years 
less learning than young people in germany and japan who are 
competing for those good jobs mike dukakis wants them to have 
a lot of our young people want to go on to college but cant 
afford to so they go right to work in a tough world economy that 
pays young unskilled workers 25 to 40 percent less than 15 years 
ago 
whats all this got to do with you if youre not poor your kids 
are in college you have a job and your companys doing fine 
ill tell you what all these people in trouble are growing as 
a percent of our population if they cant do the jobs of today and 
tomorrow well all be in trouble 
i want michael dukakis to be president because he knows we dont 
have a single person to waste 
i want michael dukakis to be president because he cares that one 
in four of our children under 5 is living in poverty and that 
without good child health programs and preschool for those who need 
it we are cheating their future and ours 
i want michael dukakis to be president because he understands 
that today it costs a middleclass family much more of its income 
to send a child to college than it did when he and i went a 
generation ago and that government has to help make up the 
difference 
i want michael dukakis to be president because he knows one big 
reason hundred of thousands of parents and children are homeless is 
that this administration has cut government housing starts by 800 
percent since 1980 
i want michael dukakis to be president because he feels the pain 
of a mother who leaves for work every day worried sick about her 
children not being in a good affordable day care center partly due 
to the governments feeble efforts in child care 
i want michael dukakis to be president not just because he 
knows and cares about these problems but because hes tackled them 
in his state and hes proved time and again that he can make a 
difference in peoples lives 
when the republicans gather in new orleans next month theyll 
talk about these family problems too theyll feature some of their 
good governors just remember they had the white house for eight 
long years and did nothing

the american civil liberties union joined 
oliver north and two other irancontra defendants on wednesday in 
asking the us court of appeals to dismiss charges against the 
three men on ground that immunized testimony would be used against 
them at trial 
north former white house national security adviser john m 
poindexter and arms dealer albert hakim along with the aclu said 
the use of testimony the three men gave congress last year would 
violate their fifth amendment protection against selfincrimination 
at the minimum they said the appellate court should order us 
district judge gerhard a gesell to hold a pretrial hearing to 
give them an opportunity to show that the evidence to be used 
against them is tainted 
last month gesell rejected the defendants complaints that the 
conspiracy case is based on tainted evidence 
he said he had conducted an extensive preliminary inquiry 
including an inspection of grand jury testimony and exhibits in his 
chambers and found nothing suggesting that any of the 
defendants have had their fifth amendment rights impaired in a 
manner that significantly affects their right to a fair trial 
given these factual circumstances gesell held in a 34page 
ruling it is not difficult to reach a preliminary decision that 
the case should proceed to trial 
north a retired marine lieutenant colonel and his former boss 
poindexter and hakim testified extensively last year before the 
joint congressional irancontra committees under grants of 
immunity a fourth defendant retired air force maj gen richard 
v secord also testified but without immunity 
attorneys for north filed a motion with gesell to delay the 
start of the trial now scheduled for sept 20 until march 1989 
to force a trial at that time sept 20 would cause a 
proceeding without even the semblance of fairness and run afoul of 
the most basic principles of due process required by the 
constitution said north attorney barry s simon 
north is charged with conspiring to illegally divert usiran 
armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels poindexter hakim and 
secord are accused of carrying out a secret operation to put funds 
from iran arms sales and other sources into unauthorized hands for 
personal profit by deceiving congress obstructing 
investigations altering documents abusing the tax laws and by 
other means prohibited by law 
in their motion the three defendants said there were critical 
issues arising out of the decision of the united states 
government to compel testimony and other information from 
themto broadcast that immunized testimony live to tens of 
millions of people around the world and then to indict and seek to 
try these men for the matters as to which they testified 
never before has the government disseminated immunized 
testimony of putative defendants so widely and never before has 
immunized testimony caught so much rapt attention they argued 
given the infusion of immunized testimony in our community by 
choice of the government defendants submit that the broad use 
and derivative use of immunized testimony by the grand jury the 
prosecutors and the witnesses has been inevitable and that no 
satisfactory showing is possible as a matter of law 
at a bare minimum defendants submit that the indictment 
must be dismissed unless the government can meet its extraordinary 
burden of proving no use with the defense having a fair 
opportunity to test the governments showing in a proper 
adversarial posture the said 
kate martin director of the aclu foundation national security 
project who filed the organizations friend of the court 
brief told a news conference this prosecution violates the 
basic principle that the government cannot force an individual to 
be a witness against him or herself 
she said the aclu has no reason to question the good faith of 
the independent counsels office in attempting to avoid the use of 
immunized testimony 
however the issue is not whether the prosecutor acted in good 
faith but whether the defendants constitutional rights are 
violated said ms martin it is critically important that 
these rights be afforded even to those who may have themselves 
subverted the constitution to shrink from protecting these basic 
rights would pose as great a threat to our liberties as any posed 
by the irancontra affair

arizona delegates to the democratic national 
convention reacted angrily wednesday to what they said was a racist 
political cartoon in the phoenix gazette making fun of jesse 
jacksons presidential bid 
the cartoon showed a miniature likeness of jackson dressed in 
the garb of an old south stable hand and holding out a ring used 
for tethering horses jackson is poised in front of 
plantationstyle white house where democratic nominee michael 
dukakis is telling his wife well kitty i think weve found a 
spot for jesse 
sixty members of the arizona contingent including 53 of the 55 
delegates and alternates had signed a letter to the editor by the 
time the convention resumed wednesday night the letter said the 
cartoon portrayed arizona as a haven for racism and demanded an 
apology from the newspaper 
larry ferguson a gazette editorial writer who approved the 
cartoon defended it as reasonable comment for a cartoonist and 
said no apology was warranted 
stanley lubin a dukakis alternate from phoenix who drafted the 
petition called the cartoon an insensitive piece of journalism 
if they politically dont like what were doing thats 
fine he added if they dont like jesse jackson thats fine 
but to depict jesse jackson as slave in front of a plantation is 
disgusting 
ferguson said cartoonist len borozinski is given a great deal of 
latitude in what he draws and that all cartoonists have weird 
minds 
he put himself in dukakis place ferguson said he sees 
dukakis as having slighted jesse and that dukakis would really like 
to see the reverend jackson someplace other than his present 
position

just as he did in massachusetts president dukakis will insist 
that we all become partners in the fight for americas future that 
we share the responsibility of forging it so that we can share the 
glory of achieving it 
hell have business partners like eugene lang a wealthy 
businessman who decided to keep hope alive at his old 
elementary school in harlem he gave the poor children there a 
dream of their own by promising all who would stay in school a 
scholarship to college michael dukakis will share and spread that 
dream 
hell have teaching partners like jaime escalante the hero of 
the movie stand and deliver whose entire class of poor 
students in east los angeles stunned the education world by passing 
the advanced placement calculus test under the guidance of a 
teacher who believes that all children can learn and that students 
will perform at the level of our expectation my friends when it 
comes to education michael dukakis will stand and deliver 
hell have public service partners like marian edelman the 
president of the childrens defense fund who has fought a 
courageous bipartisan battle in congress for early investment in 
children reminding us all that we can invest in them now or pay a 
much higher price for our neglect later michael dukakis knows we 
must invest in our children while they still have a future 
hell have political partners like lloyd bentsen who built a 
successful business then went back into politics to keep our free 
enterprise system and our nations defenses strong so that others 
could have the same chance he had to succeed and who has had a 
lifetime commitment to the principle that everybody should have 
that chance 
michael dukakis will have political partners like jesse jackson 
who in 1977 long before it was popular went with me into the 
arkansas public schools to plead with the students to say no to 
drugs to open their brains and not their veins like jesse 
jackson michael dukakis has fought for drugfree schools with his 
governors alliance against drugs like jesse jackson michael 
dukakis knows its not enough to urge our children to just say 
no to drugs they must be able to say yes to life too 
not long ago police in detroit broke the biggest crack ring in 
that city it was being run by two brothers from the mississippi 
delta area of arkansas they had brought over 100 other young men 
up from their home county to help them peddle dope

the news reports said these country boys were more reliable than 
the streetsmart city kids they gave a good days work for a good 
days pay 
the unemployment rate in the county these boys fled is almost 20 
percent 
for black teenagers its more than twice that most farmers 
and business people there are too broke to help get them off the 
street those kids could make more money in a month in detroit than 
they could in a year back home 
i wonder if their decision to deal misery for money would have 
been different if president dukakis had had eight years to make 
good on his commitment to good schools and good jobs for all our 
people in all our communities i think they might have been able to 
say no to drugs and yes to life 
my friends we are moving into a future which richly rewards 
learning achievement and innovation it punishes ignorance and 
waste and the pursuit of shortterm profits at the expense of 
longterm growth 
we need a president who understands the future and its 
challenges michael dukakis does 
this is one of those pivotal moments in our history the issue 
is not whether we move left or right it is whether we move ahead 
or fall behind its impossible to stand still in the strong 
currents of change which engulf us 
in these times of change the democratic party has a place for 
all americans who share our vision of the future and want to do 
their part democrats republicans and independents michael 
dukakis has proved he will reach out to bring us all together 
the strength of his message rests on two simple but powerful 
ideas 
the first is that we are all in this fight for the future 
together whether they know it or not the future of the california 
entrepreneur and the new york investment banker is tied to the 
droughtstricken debtridden farmer in north dakota and he poorest 
black school child in mississippi 
were all in this together the second idea is that we must be 
willing to do what it takes today to guarantee our childrens 
tomorrow

jimmy carter threw a party for his former white 
house staffers wednesday and 400 of them showed up to eat drink 
and talk about old times on the potomac 
its not everyday you can get jimmy carter to buy you a 
drink said former press secretary jody powell who now works for 
an advertising agency in washington 
the lavishly catered reception was held at the carter 
presidential center some four miles east of the site of the 
democrats national convention 
were just here to have a good time not talk politics 
carter told reporters who attempted to gauge his feelings about 
events at the convention where michael dukakis was being chosen as 
this years nominee carter received a warm response when he 
addressed the convention monday night 
its so great to see all these people said rosalynn carter 
as she and her husband circulated separately through the crowd 
ive talked to people i havent seen in years 
others those who showed up to munch and mingle were former sen 
edmund muskie of maine who served an eightmonth stint as 
secretary of state under carter and former budget director bert 
lance 
walter mondale carters vice president didnt attend the 
party neither did hamilton jordan his former chief of staff 
whose mother reportedly is seriously ill 
muskie recalled his tenure in the carter administration with 
mixed emotions 
it was a damned good time said the former maine senator 
who now practices law in washington but my outstanding memory is 
of the iranian hostage crisis i just wish we could have gotten the 
hostages out earlier even a few days sooner might have made a 
difference in the 1980 election 
but those who did come including dozens of fellow georgians 
showered the carters with affection the former president obviously 
was delighted as he hugged kissed and chatted with the small army 
of friends and wellwishers some of whom proffered photographs and 
copies of his new trout fishing book to be signed 
this is great he said repeatedly 
muskie smiled as he watched carter circulate through the crowd 
its evident his star is on the rise he said from now 
on i think youll see a different attitude about his presidency 
and about him

i had a college professor who taught me that the key to 
americas success over more than 200 years is that our people have 
always believed the future can be better than the present and that 
each individual has a personal moral responsibility to make it so 
he said we were in college because our parents preferred our future 
to their own present he said as long as the american people 
prefer their childrens future to their present were going to be 
all right but if we ever reach the point where they dont weve 
had it and dont you ever forget it 
michael dukakis wont ever forget it his whole life is a 
tribute to the enduring strength of the american dream he knows 
that unless that dream is real for all our children it is not 
secure for any of them and hell help us seize the future and make 
it ours 
in november when michael dukakis is elected president we will 
observe the 25th anniversary of president kennedys death 
but mikes victory will be a tribute to the life and legacy of 
john kennedy to the boundless optimism the grace the courage 
and the sheer joy with which he urged us forward 
the great israeli statesman abba eban began his memorial 
tribute to president kennedy with this simple stirring statement 
tragedy is the difference between what is and what might have 
been 
michael dukakis has spent his entire public life closing the gap 
between what is and what might have been that is why he should be 
president of the united states 
and so my fellow democrats i proudly place into nomination the 
name of the man who will become the 4lst president of the united 
states michael dukakis

jesse martin would be proud of you and we are proud of you

power in america she proclaimed so many who were formerly 
locked out are now locked in 
but mrs king said many of the dreams her husband voiced in his 
1983 speech remain unfulfilled 
something is still wrong when 32 million americans are living 
in poverty in the richest nation on the face of the earth when 
nearly 13 million of them are children she said

a tragic mistake to attract the haves to any party at the expense

a federal judge wednesday sentenced 
convicted colombian cocaine kingpin carlos lehder rivas to a 
maximum life sentence without parole plus 135 years as a sign of 
societys determination to expunge this cancer 
us district judge howell w melton brushed aside lehders 
contention that he was a political prisoner 
lehder who prosecutors called a key figure in the medellin 
cartel drug ring said to be responsible for 80 percent of the 
colombian cocaine coming into the united states was convicted in 
may of importing 33 tons of cocaine into the country from his 
island smuggling headquarters in the bahamas 
melton imposed the harshest penalty possible under federal law 
over defense objections that it exceeded the maximum allowable 
under the uscolombia extradition treaty 
the sentence is a message a signal to our society that it 
will do everything it can to rid itself of this cancer melton 
said 
during a 25minute speech to the court prior to the sentencing 
lehder portrayed himself as a victim of the political ambitions of 
us attorney robert merkle now a candidate for the republican 
nomination for floridas us senate seat 
i have been mr merkles hostage said lehder im a 
political prisoner my arrest is illegal 
he said he had been kidnapped and illegally brought to this 
country because he had been a political leader in colombia working 
to overthrow the uscolombia extradition treaty 
he was a victim of mistreatment and harassment and 
psychological torture ordered by mr merkle lehder said in 
slightly accented english 
but melton who earlier wednesday sentenced lehders 
codefendant jack carlton reed to 15 years in prison said politics 
was not at the root of the case 
you were not convicted because of your political beliefs 
because you are a colombian the judge said the truth of the 
matter is the smuggling was done for money greed 
prosecutors had asked for life without parole on the charge of 
running a continuing criminal enterprise plus 15 years each of 10 
drugsmuggling charges but under the law one drugsmuggling charge 
had to be concurrent with the life sentence leading to the 
135year total 
lehder will also have to pay 350000 in fines reed was fined 
25000 for his conviction on a single count of conspiracy to 
import cocaine 
merkles replacement us attorney joe magri who attended the 
sentencing as a spectator called lehder a cocaine 
narcoterrorist and applauded the sentence 
the judge fairly justly and appropriately socked it to a 
hoodlum said magri the sentence sends a clear message that 
were serious about stopping narcotics traffic 
lehder 38 one of the leaders of the violent medellin cartel 
was convicted may 19 of smuggling colombian cocaine into the united 
states through the bahamas 
defense attorneys edward shohat and jose quinon had asked the 
judge to impose a 20year sentence at most which they said would 
be four times longer than the terms being served by the former 
smugglers who turned against lehder and testified for the 
government 
after listening to almost four hours of arguments and objections 
from lehders attorneys to presentence reports melton told the 
defendant that the government had presented monumental amounts of 
incriminating evidence against you 
reciting the lengthy list of convictions the judge said they 
did not adequately portray the evidence of your crimes 
testimony in the sevenmonth trial included allegations that 
bahamian officials including prime minister lynden o pindling 
helped lehder and his smuggling organization run more than 20 tons 
of cocaine from colombia through normans cay into deserted 
airstrips in florida and georgia 
pindling and his aides have repeatedly denied the allegations 
lehder was extradited to the united states last year following a 
gun battle and his arrest by the colombian army at a plush mansion 
in medellin 
he also is under indictment in miami for his role in the cartel 
and there is a sealed indictment against him in los angeles but 
officials have said it is highly unlikely that he will be tried on 
those charges 
reed 57 of san pedro calif a pilot in the drugsmuggling 
ring stood silently as he was sentenced government witnesses had 
testified that he had made at least seven flights from the bahamas 
to ferry 2500 pounds of cocaine into airports in florida and 
georgia

former white house chief of staff howard 
baker said tuesday he doesnt want to be vice president but he 
would accept the republican nomination for the job if asked 
the idea of returning to washington as vice president sounds 
like somebody trying to revoke my parole baker told the 
asheville citizen he resigned his white house job earlier this 
year 
but baker said he wouldnt turn down an offer from vice 
president george bush to take the no 2 slot on the ticket 
if he caught me and asked me point blank to do it i would do 
it baker said but before he caught me i would make an 
athletic effort to escape i really dont want to be the vice 
presidential candidate 
baker met with reporters briefly after addressing about 400 
institutional investors at a seminar at a local hotel his speech 
for which he reportedly received 30000 was closed to the press 
before coming to the white house baker served as minority and 
majority leader during his 18 years as a us senator from 
tennessee 
i really think that vice president bush has some awfully good 
men to choose from baker said he certainly hasnt asked me 
and i dont expect he will 
other nominees who might be available to bush include illinois 
gov richard thompson former tennessee gov lamar alexander and 
former united nations ambassador jeane kirkpatrick baker said 
baker rejected arguments that bush should choose a southerner to 
join him on the ticket because democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis picked sen lloyd bentsen of texas as his running 
mate 
i think politics is not a chess game you dont move and 
countermove baker said i think instead vice president bush 
needs to find somebody hes compatible with somebody whos a 
good campaigner somebody who will bring something to the ticket 
although he had high praise for bentsen baker said his 
selection will not make a major difference in the presidential 
campaign 
i think its good from the democratic side i think that lloyd 
bentsen is a very capable person very attractive person baker 
said 
its a pretty obvious strategy by governor dukakis to reach 
out to the south and also to give the impression of moving to the 
middle but i dont think its going to matter much baker said 
people dont vote for the vice presidential candidate they 
vote for the presidential candidate he said how the south 
responds to michael dukakis is going to depend almost entirely on 
what dukakis says not what bentsen says

united nations the un secretarygeneral said wednesday he is 
sending a team to iran and iraq to work out details of a ceasefire 
and will announce a starting date soon iraq proposed direct talks 
between the belligerents 
javier perez de cuellar the un secretarygeneral called the 
ceasefire date dday he said he prefers direct negotiations 
between the parties but iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar 
mahallati declared no no 
iran announced monday it would accept 598 a yearold security 
council resolution demanding an end to the 8yearold war 
irans revolutionary and spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini told his people wednesday that accepting a truce with 
iraq was more deadly to me than poison but he asked them to 
support his decision khomeini had adamantly opposed ending the war 
before iraqi president saddam hussein was driven from power he 
said could not reveal yet why he changed his mind 
the council on wednesday unanimously adopted a mild resolution 
expressing deep distress over the accidental us destruction 
of an iranian passenger jet on july 3 with the loss of 290 lives 
iran wanted the united states condemned for the incident and 
mahallati said after the resolution was adopted i am not 
satisfied the united states said the uss vincennes mistook the 
airliner for an attacking iranian warplane 
in the persian gulf the war continued iran said its jet 
fighters flew four sorties wednesday over northeastern iraq 
bombing the area around the dukan dam and troop positions near haj 
omran it said the attacks were retaliation for iraqi raids tuesday 
on industrial targets in southwestern iran 
iraq said two iranian jets tried to bomb the dam near kirkuk at 
about dawn but missed and antiaircraft fire chased them off the 
iraqis said their own planes attacked two oil pumping stations near 
izeh in southwestern iran and captured territory in the mountainous 
northern border region 
wednesday was the anniversary of the adoption last july of 
resolution 598 which provides for an immediate ceasefire 
withdrawal of military forces to recognized borders prisoner 
exchange and an investigation to determine who started the war 
the iraqis said soon afterward they would accept it if iran did 
but the iranians said no truce could take effect until iraq was 
branded the aggressor iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after 
several border skirmishes 
perez de cuellar said a team of 1012 military officers from 
un middle east operations would work out ceasefire details with 
officials in baghdad and tehran and return in no moe than a week 
he did not announce their itinerary 
after that the secretarygeneral said he will announce a 
starting date promptly and set dates for troop withdrawal 
prisoner exchange peace negotiations and the investigation of 
responsibility for the war 
when the ceasefire takes effect perez de cuellar said he will 
send up to 250 military observers into the area to verify and 
supervise the truce and withdrawal of military forces 
he said the team leaving immediately would be from the un 
truce supervision organization based in jerusalem and led by lt 
gen martin vadset the groups chief of staff a political 
officer whom he did not identify is to join the group 
perez de cuellar said he would continue separate negotiations in 
new york with iranian and iraqi representatives 
asked about the iraqi proposal for direct talks he said i 
have no objection i have a preference for direct negotiations 
he noted that resolution 598 calls for negotiations between the two 
sides 
mahallati the iranian envoy rejected direct talks in comments 
to reporters another iranian diplomat mohammad javad zarif told 
journalists his country will observe a ceasefire during the 
technical teams visit and continue an informal ceasefire later if 
iraq does the same 
iraqs proposal for direct talks was contained in a letter to 
perez de cuellar from foreign minister tariq aziz 
aziz said it was necessary to test whether the iranian 
acceptance of the resolution is serious or tactical with 
partial or temporary solutions instead of a comprehensive 
solution 
the iraqis have said iran appears to be buying time to rebuild 
its economy and army so it can resume the war 
another iraqi proposal is that the shattalarab waterway which 
forms the delta of the tigris and euphrates rivers and is iraqs 
only sea outlet be cleared under un auspices 
it forms the southern border between iraq and iran and where the 
line lies is in dispute iraq launched the initial invasion of the 
war across the shatt which now is clogged with mines and sunken 
ships 
in his letter aziz also said iraq wants an immediate guarantee 
of its right to free navigation in the persian gulf and insisted 
that iran stop attacking tankers and other ships of nations not 
involved in the war

sen john kerry condemned the moral darkness of 
the reaganbush administration wednesday and told delegates to 
the democratic national convention it was time for a government 
of laws and not of lawbreakers 
kerry a freshman senator from massachusetts the home state of 
michael dukakis promised that in a dukakis administration the 
government that makes the laws will not break the law 
and in the america of jesse jackson he said the 
government that says no to drugs will not say yes to general 
noriega 
it is time that we once again had a government of laws and not 
of lawbreakers its time we had an attorney general of the united 
states who is an agent of justice and not the target of criminal 
investigation kerry declared 
the liberal democrat raised the ethics issue two days after a 
special prosecutor released a longawaited report on attorney 
general edwin meese iii saying the nations top law enforcement 
official probably violated federal law in his personal finances 
but committed no crimes in the wedtech scandal 
kerry also scored the reagan administration and by 
implication vice president bush for allowing a twobit 
dictator like panamas gen manuel noriega to peddle drugs for 
planning an illegal war in central america and for plotting to 
sell arms to iran 
kerry made no mention of ethical questions encountered by some 
prominent democrats sen lloyd bentsen of texas dukakis choice 
for a running mate backed off a plan to invite lobbyists to pay 
10000 each to have breakfast with him and house speaker jim 
wright is under scrutiny by the house ethics committee because of 
questions about royalties on a book 
the invitation to speak on ethics was a political plum for 
kerry who served as lieutenant governor under dukakis until his 
election to the senate in 1984 kerry 44 now chairs the 
democratic senate campaign committee the partys fundraising arm 
for the 1988 senate races 
kerry was originally to have delivered the speech tuesday night 
but the proceedings were running late and so it was rescheduled for 
wednesday

this man knows what justice on the job means he has long 
recognized that without equal economic opportunity and economic 
rights there can be no real political democracy 
no real freedom 
and yes this man is a man of history a mover and shaker in 
the power struggles of freedom and tyranny of democracy and 
autocracy 
the poet langston hughes long ago said it for us all and i 
quote him now 
 
a long time ago 
an enslaved people heading toward freedom 
made up a song 
keep your hand on the plow hold on 
that plow plowed a new furrow 
across the field of history 
into that furrow the freedom seed was dropped 
from that seed a tree grew is growing 
will ever grow 
that tree is for everybody 
for all america for all the world 
may its branches spread and its shelter grow 
until all races and all peoples know its shade 
keep your hands on the plow hold on 
 
any american worker blue collar gray collar pink collar or 
white collar who has been displaced or dispossessed of his or her 
job who has been subjugated to a masterslave relationship by 
corporate arrogance and profits without production can identify 
with langston hughes and freedoms plow 
and it well may be todays unreported and untold story but the 
man im about to nominate has been telling it like it is 
and i am inordinately proud and uniquely privileged to offer in 
nomination for the office of president of the united states jesse 
louis jackson

authorities closed the overcrowded omni 
convention arena for the second straight night wednesday as 
democrats prepared to nominate michael dukakis as their 1988 
presidential candidate 
this building has been closed by order of the fire marshal 
state police officer lj robinson announced at 903 pm more than 
a dozen police officers stood in front of one entrance to enforce 
the closure 
the democratic national committee said in a statement that it 
concurred with the decision in the interest of safety of all 
those in the hall 
several delegates were caught outside the hall including ann 
richards the texas state treasurer who delivered the conventions 
keynote speech monday night and some members of congress reps 
peter rodino of new jersey and les aspin and gerald kleczka of 
wisconsin 
there was no hassle at all said ms richards i came late 
and the hall was full no theyll do the count and well see what 
well see if i dont get in well watch it on television 
its a little bit of a consternation said rodino 
chuckling he added and im a super delegate 
aspin said being kept out of the hall was no big deal i 
wouldnt worry about it i think dukakis will make it without me 
kleczka commented im not upset but were going to have to 
talk to a supervisor here because im an atlarge delegate and an 
alternate cant vote for me if i dont get in wisconsin is one 
vote short 
also caught on the outside were bert lance and his wife 
labelle and former wisconsin gov pat lucey lance who was 
director of the office of management and budget under president 
carter has been a key adviser to jesse jackson in this years 
campaign 
if pete rodino and les aspin are on the outside im with 
them lance said 
a delegate walking by him muttered if he cant get in nobody 
can the delegate declined to give her name 
rep robert garcia of new york said he barely made it into the 
hall but that a number of his colleagues did not including sen 
j bennett johnston of louisiana and reps paul kanjorski of 
pennsylvania jim slattery of kansas and brian donnelly of 
masssachusetts 
although there were some chants at one gate of let the 
delegates in and we shall overcome the mood generally was 
goodnatured unlike tuesday night when some tempers had flared 
mrs lance spent the time outdoors buying a convention button 
from a vendor 
the vendor tony lyons said its a great tribute to the 
democratic process that senators and congressmen are waiting out 
here with the common man 
atlanta fire chief william h hamer had said earlier wednesday 
that officials would not hesitate to seal the democratic convention 
arena again if it were crowded beyond capacity 
democratic national committee officials said wednesday night 
that they had two counters at each entrance to monitor the flow of 
traffic in and out of the building 
up to 1000 angry conventiongoers confronted security officials 
tuesday night when the omni reached capacity just before jesse 
jacksons speech spurring fire officials to seal the building 
asked about the potential of closing the hall again during 
wednesdays session hamer was clear that he wouldnt hesitate to 
do so 
we have to thats the law the only thing were going to 
do is basically the same thing hamer said we will try to be 
as lenient as possible and as flexible as we can but its a matter 
of life and death 
the interior of the convention hall was redesigned to present a 
more pleasing television appearance seating was reduced to an 
estimated 11000 hamer said that number can be expanded to about 
12500 
atlanta mayor andrew young blamed much of the overcrowding on 
the hordes of journalists in the hall most news organizations have 
their working areas at the adjacent georgia world congress center 
what we had was a lot of people reporters who normally would 
be working in the georgia world congress center or would be on 
assignment in other places deciding that that the omni was the 
place they wanted to be last night he said

the defense ministry said wednesday 
that 11 rebels and seven civilians were killed in attacks this week 
which violated a ceasefire between the contras and the leftist 
sandinista government 
also wednesday foreign ministry representatives requested a 
visa for ambassador carlos tunnerman to travel to the united 
states days after the reagan administration expelled him he 
returned from washington saturday 
a ministry statement said seven civilians died including two 
children aged 7 and 9 and five were wounded tuesday when a rebel 
band ambushed two vehicles in which the victims were riding near 
juigalpa 55 miles east of managua 
it said nine rebels were killed monday when sandinista troops 
fought off their attack near muelle de los bueyes and muhan 
neighboring villages in southern nicaragua near the caribbean coast 
the statement gave no details and made no mention of government 
casualties 
it said two rebels were killed and one was wounded in an attack 
tuesday on troops near san rafael del norte 110 miles north of the 
capital city of managua it said the troops repelled the attack by 
the ussupported rebels 
president daniel ortega announced on tuesday that his government 
was unilaterally extending to aug 30 a ceasefire scheduled to 
expire at the end of july 
the contras have not said if they will agree to the extension 
both sides have charged frequent violations in the ceasefire 
that began march 21 and has been extended repeatedly no talks have 
been scheduled to negotiate a lasting peace agreement since the 
last round broke off in june 
staterun radio voice of nicaragua said tunnerman needed to 
travel to the united states to take part in an international 
education contest and functions related to his job as ambassador to 
the organization of american states 
us embassy officials refused to comment wednesday night 
the united states on july 11 ordered tunnerman and seven other 
nicaraguan diplomats to leave in retaliation for nicaraguas 
expulsion of us ambassador richard melton and seven american 
diplomats 
the us embassy stopped issuing tourist visas to nicaraguans on 
july 13 one day after melton left citing a shortage of personnel 
the measure does not affect diplomatic visas 
nicaragua argued that tunnerman did not have to leave the united 
states because he also represented his country in the oas 
tunnerman left washington just ahead of a state department deadline 
for his departure assailing his expulsion as unjustified and 
illegal 
the oas charter says attendance at oas meetings shall not 
depend on bilateral relations between any member state and the 
united states the host country 
but the reagan administration said a separate agreement between 
the united states and the oas authorizes the us government to 
order any oas diplomat home 
an interior department spokeswoman said wednesday in another 
development that 40 people arrested for an antigovernment 
demonstration on july 10 will be tried in criminal courts on 
charges of criminal association and causing injury 
patricia orozco director of the departments press office said 
evidence would be presented thursday 
special police courts earlier revoked the maximum sixmonth 
sentences they imposed in 36 of the cases last week so the cases 
could be transferred to criminal court 
human rights groups have described the police courts as 
arbitrary and unconstitutional 
critics of the government had complained bitterly about the 
sentences arising from the demonstration in nandaime a town 40 
miles south of managua the nicaraguan democratic coordinate a 
coalition of political parties business and labor groups opposing 
the sandinistas organized the demonstration 
fighting broke out between police and thousands of demonstrators 
among those arrested were carlos huembes the coordinates 
president roger guevara its secretary miriam arguello 
secretarygeneral of the conservative party and agustin jarquin a 
leader of the social christian party 
the government closed down the roman catholic radio station and 
suspended publication of the opposition newspaper la prensa for 15 
days for their reporting on the demonstration

president lee tenghui announced a major 
cabinet shakeup wednesday that suggested a gradual approach to 
fulfilling his promise of further liberalizing nationalist party 
rule over taiwan 
lee kept premier yu kuohwa the governments leading 
conservative but brought eight new officials into the 25member 
cabinet and transferred seven to new cabinet posts several 
reformminded nationalist lawmakers had called for yus resignation 
the reshuffle came one week after the landmark 13th nationalist 
party congress retired several chiang kaishek era conservatives 
while promoting a younger generation of party leaders including 
many native taiwanese 
the nationalists led by chiang set up their authoritarian 
government in taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to communist 
forces on the chinese mainland those born on the mainland have 
long dominated the partys top ranks although native taiwanese 
comprise 85 percent of the islands nearly 20 million people 
lee a 65yearold native taiwanese was acclaimed nationalist 
chairman by the party congress july 8 he received approval for the 
new cabinet at a wednesday meeting of the partys policymaking 
central standing committee officials said the changes take effect 
next monday 
the average age of the cabinet fell from 62 to 58 and the number 
of native taiwanese rose from eight to 11 as they picked up the key 
posts of foreign minister and finance minister 
shirley kuo 58 deputy governor of the central bank becomes 
the first woman minister as head of the finance ministry replacing 
robert chien 59 named the cabinets secretarygeneral 
lee has pledged to continue democratic reform and other 
liberalization begun by his predecessor chiang chingkuo the 
eldest son of chiang kaishek 
chiang chingkuo lifted martial law and ended a ban on 
opposition parties in the months before his death jan 13 
many of the new cabinet members are viewed as technocrats 
including several groomed by yu and other party conservatives from 
mainland china but some observers believe the new lineup should 
speed liberalization of the statedominated economic system 
lin anlo chief economist at the chunghwa institute for 
economic research said premier yu has been under tremendous 
pressure to reform we hope he can do better with the cooperation 
of the younger cabinet members 
lee called for reform of the economic and financial system but 
economists say the government has moved slowly so as not to 
irritate powerful vested interests 
the party controls taiwans banks and many other large 
enterprises conservative party members generally oppose 
privatization of banks and other businesses and reform of the tax 
system steps many people say are needed to modernize the economy 
vice premier lien chan 52 replaces 64yearold ding moushih 
as foreign minister 
frederick chien 54 taiwans representative in washington 
replaces chao yaotung 73 as head of the council for economic 
planning and development 
chen lian 51 chairman of the national science council 
replaces 69yearold lee tahai as economic affairs minister 
the youngest cabinet member is ma yingjeou 38 appointed head 
of the research development and evaluation commission 
lee also said wednesday that parliamentary reforms should be 
implemented this year to make us more fit for constitutional 
democracy 
taiwans parliamentary bodies are now dominated by aging 
nationalists elected on the chinese mainland before 1949 and frozen 
in office to support the nationalists claim to be the rightful 
ruler of all china 
the nationalist party proposed increasing the number of locally 
elected seats while allowing aging mainlanders to retire 
but the opposition democratic progressive party wants all seats 
in the legislative yuan the highest lawmaking body and the 
national assembly electoral college to be contested in next years 
elections

britains pert uniformed meter maids made famous 
by a beatles song about a lovely one called rita are being 
upstaged by the dreaded denver boot 
scotland yards zealous some say overzealous attack on 
illegally parked cars has turned london into the worlds 
carclamping capital and has prompted a storm of protests 
the denver boot developed in colorado in the 1950s fits over a 
wheel immobilizing a car until the driver pays a fee and a crew 
comes to unlock it that can take hours 
the metropolitan police department decided to get tough 18 
months ago when it privatized clamping by contracting the 
practice to two private companies 
today 22 squads each consisting of a civilian clamper and a 
police officer prowl the innerlondon boroughs of westminster 
kensington chelsea and camden they clamp 400 to 500 vehicles a 
day and the civilian clampers get paid an undisclosed sum for each 
one which critics say encourages them to overclamp 
london uses the clamp as an enforcement tool more than any 
other city said scotland yard chief inspector john marle 
events like the chelsea flower show and sales at harrods 
department store can prove bonanzas for clampers who can 
immobilize a car in seconds 
the crackdown has proved a boon for some clever entrepreneurs 
who have launched a whole new industry commercial unclamping 
young men have formed squads of radiocarrying motorcycle riders 
who for a fee will go pay the clamping fee 
parking has long been a problem in this puzzling city of 
squares alleys and culsdesac where 350000 cases of illegal 
parking occur daily 
the streets of london were being clogged with illegally parked 
vehicles marle said sounding very official this prevented 
vehicles from moving around the capital with ease 
scotland yard turned to clamping because all other methods 
failed marle said 
the highprofile clamp hasnt and illegal parking has dropped 
40 percent in certain areas he said 
here are the gory details 
after a driver gets over the shock of discovering that his car 
has been clamped he must go to one of three payment points in the 
city and pay a 43 clamping fine followed by a 20 parking fine 
then he must wait for an unclamping crew to arrive cars are 
freed in order of fees paid and crews themselves can get caught in 
traffic 
we would not expect anybody to wait more than four hours 
the chief inspector said 
among the unclampers the car clamp recovery club which calls 
itself the original and biggest charges a 44 annual fee and 14 
per job for an additional minimum 26 it will deliver a car to a 
destination of the customers choice 
the critics claim clamping exacerbates the problem by cuffing 
cars exactly where they dont belong 
mark reed a real estate agent said persistent clamping forced 
him to sell his agency and move its going to affect business in 
a big way in central london he said 
jacqueline pruskin who operates art galleries in kensington and 
chelsea said clamping hurts people such as plumbers whose 
livelihood depends on mobility as well as merchants whose 
customers are frightened off by the clamp threat 
fortunately not too many drivers get violent about it 
theres been an odd incident but very odd marle said he 
conceded however theres a lot of verbal violence 
reed freely admits to using strong language when he caught a 
clamper crawling down the street trying to to clamp his car 
unnoticed 
i said this is a pretty rightwing sort of nazi thing youre 
doing reed recalled 
newspapers have reported clampers nabbing ambulances tour 
buses disabled cars a participant in a funeral procession and a 
van bringing meals to the homeless 
marle calls the reports outrageous journalese saying the 
police dont clamp cars where it would be obstructive or dangerous 
those vehicles they remove 
clampers clamp only in cases authorized by the accompanying 
police officers he said 
he added that scotland yard doesnt generally discuss individual 
cases but in the incident involving the van he said the driver 
parked on the sidewalk a common london offense and was warned 
repeatedly before being clamped 
genuine mistakes are sometimes made he said and we 
correct them as fast as we can

just two months after it opened a private 
bookstore that specializes in translations of western works is in 
danger of closing a victim of the cold hard world of economics 
weve got problems we owe everybody said liu yuanshang as 
she sat recently in a cluttered storage hall behind her three 
flavors bookroom but we have a lot of people supporting us so we 
have hope 
ms liu 48 opened the store may 18 in a onestory wood and 
stone house in western beijing her husband li shiqiang 44 and 
her former husband yu chen 58 are her main partners 
named after a short story by the famous early 20thcentury 
writer lu xun three flavors is a special bookstore filled with 
chineselanguage books on american law capitalist economics 
modern art and psychology 
these subjects were taboo during chinas ultraleftist cultural 
revolution of 196676 and still are not completely accepted by the 
state 
we are a bookstore for intellectual adventurers said ms 
liu we want to help open the minds of the chinese people 
unlike governmentrun stores where books are locked in glass 
cases the three flavors puts its books on open shelves and 
encourages customers to browse 
one recent day an elderly gentlemen in tshirt and shorts sat 
in a corner and fanned himself slowly reading a shakespeare play 
in chinese 
nearby a young woman sat at the edge of a red bench lost in the 
poetry of robert louis stevenson 
my school is very far away but i often come here to read 
said li yin 18 looking up from her poems it is wonderful to 
read here because they make you feel at home 
ms liu said she and her partners opened the store because they 
were disgusted by the selection offered in other beijing stores 
too many stores these days are selling bad books just 
designed for quick excitement theyre dirty books or detective 
books ms liu said but we want to sell books that will give 
our readers more knowledge china is backward and we need to learn 
more 
the store had to be privately owned said ms liu to be as free 
as possible in the selection of stock 
i didnt want anyone leading us around by the nose 
more than half the books are translations of western books 
recently published in china on one shelf a collection by french 
philosopher jeanpaul sartre sits next to goodbye colombus by 
philip roth on another friedrich nietzsche vies with the agony 
and the ecstasy irving stones biography of michaelangelo 
ms liu said she was branded a rightist at age 18 in 1958 
and was unable to get a job for 20 years 
and after that the job i got was no good they made me an 
english teacher but i had forgotten all my english 
chinas recent reforms allowing limited private industry gave 
ms liu a way out she and her partners pooled their life savings 
and last year bought the building for 21000 
ah what a mess it was she recalled 
relatives and friends helped renovate the building for free but 
the new pipes lights roof and windows cost money 
ms liu and her partners raised some from friends then they 
turned to a bank but chinas staterun banks are not accustomed to 
floating loans to private enterprises 
we were forced to borrow from private lenders at high 
interest she said 
as of midjuly the store was in debt 6760 
everything you see in this room isnt really ours ms liu 
said waving her hands at stacks and stacks of books we still 
have no money to pay 
but she said we have this house and we have our friends

phyllis frelich the tony awardwinning 
actress from broadways children of a lesser god has many of 
the performers on the nbc daytime drama santa barbara learning 
to use sign language for the deaf 
frelich has joined the show as sister sarah a nun who might be 
involved in a murder in the story sarah has left the mission and 
is living with julia wainwright an attorney played by nancy grahn 
all the actors i work with are learning to read and do 
signs she said nancy knew some signs so our scenes are 
comfortable and easy 
the way we work is that the other actors read my signs and 
voice my thoughts last week we got a call from a viewer who said 
the sign language was not accurate i said of course someone who 
is in stress and is with people learning to read signs will make 
mistakes its quite realistic people would also read the signs 
wrong 
frelich was interviewed with her husband bob steinberg an 
actor and former lighting director acting as her interpreter 
santa barbara is the first soap opera appearance for 
frelich who also starred in the hallmark hall of fame production 
love is never silent 
it really happened in a funny way she said i met nancy 
grahn at a benefit performance at beyond baroque of a night at the 
movies it was a whole evening of scenes and i did a scene from 
network nancy knew a few signs and said that during the writers 
strike the actors were submitting ideas 
we sat down and made up a story for us nancy took it to the 
producers and said she had this terrific idea and that they should 
put me on the show but what they did was cast me as sister sarah 
she had previously been referred to on the show they simply made 
her deaf 
in the show julia and sarah become good friends because julia 
has taken over investigation of the murder im involved in she 
said 
the question is who murdered mark mccormick the murder which 
happened several years ago has never been solved someone is 
trying to frame mason capwell lane davies hes trying to find 
out who framed him and ive been helping him 
sarah was a troubled woman taken into the mission by sister 
mary who left the church and married mccormick 
it looks as though sarah knows who the killer is said 
frelich thats the way the story seems to be going sarah is 
very confused with two conflicting personalities its a 
complicated part and its difficult to know who she is 
frelich became interested in acting while a student at gallaudet 
college a school for the hearingimpaired in washington dc she 
then joined the national theatre for the deaf she starred as a 
deaf playwright in the hands of the enemy at the mark taper 
forum in los angeles with richard dreyfuss 
acting is very difficult and jobs are scarce even more so for 
me than most actors she said ive been on the lecture 
circuit trying to make people aware and more sensitive to the 
needs of deaf people that keeps me busy between acting jobs 
she starred in the broadway version of children of a lesser 
god which was written for her by playwright mark medoff she had 
met medoff when her husband had been scenic and lighting designer 
on several of his plays 
i was the first deaf person he had known she said i told 
him there were no roles for deaf actresses he said ok ill 
write a play for you he did he went home and wrote children of 
a lesser god he wanted to write a good play he was interested in 
me as an actress and he wasnt trying to write a message play 
frelich said it was hard for her to judge the movie version

actresses lauren bacall betty comden and 
phyllis newman are among performers in the birthday bash being 
thrown in august for conductor leonard bernstein at the music 
center where he got his start 
the tanglewood music center also is celebrating the 50th 
anniversary of its music shed this summer with a special concert by 
the resident boston symphony orchestra featuring the same music 
beethovens ninth symphony that inaugurated the building in 1938 
the bernstein weekend alone with tickets as high as 5000 
each may bring in more than 1 million for the festivals 
endowment fund according to caroline smedvig of the symphony 
because tanglewood is so special for him and conversely hes 
so special to us the combination will produce what we hope will be 
a unique event she said 
the leonard bernstein gala birthday performance is a fourday 
affair beginning on the composers 70th birthday aug 25 to raise 
money for the music center 
beverly sills who announced last month that she will step down 
as general director of the new york city opera will be the host of 
the event bacall and soprano barbara hendricks will perform a 
movement from bernsteins symphony no 3 kaddish violin 
soloist midori will play two movements from his serenade 
dame gwyneth jones and frederica von stade will be among those 
performing highlights from fidelio and other works to honor 
bernsteins landmark opera recordings 
the concert will also celebrate bernsteins accomplishments in 
popular music with excerpts from such works as west side story 
and on the town 
the orchestra opened the nineweek season with the special july 
1 concert marking the first halfcentury of the music shed 
the season of classical music will be expanded with performances 
by such popular rock jazz and folk artists as the beach boys 
george benson and leo kottke 
but the highlight of the new season is the celebration of 
bernsteins birthday 
the bso is even billing the birthday party as one of the music 
worlds great occasions and is negotiating the television rights 
in the united states and europe 
among the conductors friends who have been invited to the bash 
are pop star michael jackson and british princess diana although 
tanglewood officials say the have not yet received an answer from 
the celebrities 
bernstein was a member of the original tanglewood music center 
class of 1940 where he became a protege of tanglewood founder 
serge koussevitzky 
when koussevitzky retired in 1949 he tried to have the young 
bernstein named as his successor but the bsos trustees chose 
charles munch because they considered bernstein too young and 
tainted by popular music 
he later wrote the score for the musical west side story and 
returned every summer to conduct and teach 
conductors seiji ozawa john williams john mauceri and michael 
tillson thomas will share the poduim featuring some of his works on 
the night of his birth 
the following night ozawa and special guests will appear in a 
music shed concert for a performance intended to show bernsteins 
influence on other musicians 
aug 27 will be given over to a performance of bernsteins 
mass by a 250member troupe from the indiana university school 
of music 
the fourday celebration concludes with bernstein conducting the 
annual serge and ola koussevitzky memorial concert including a 
performance of tchaikovskys symphony no 5 on aug 28 
all proceeds go to the music centers endowment fund and to a 
fund bernstein established for aspiring young conductors ticket 
prices start at 20 for a space on the lawn and go up to 5000 for 
front row seats for benefactors 
other highlights of the new season include several major debuts 
including that of soviet painist vladimir feltsman who arrived in 
the united states last august after an an eightyear battle to 
emigrate a return visit by the israel philharmonic and a recital 
by irish flutist james galway 
this summer is the second in a fouryear jubilee of the 
festivals 50th anniversary events climax in 1990 with observances 
marking the 50th year of the music center the festivals school

arms can stretch only so far 
thats the approach being taken to adjustablerate mortgages 
these days at the big governmentcreated corporations that buy and 
insure many of the home loans made in this country by banks 
savings and loans and other financial institutions 
over the last few years the federal national mortgage 
association known as fannie mae and the federal home loan 
mortgage corp or freddie mac have been tightening the standards 
for adjustablerate loans they will accept 
lately they both have adopted similar criteria if a homebuyer 
makes a down payment of less than 20 percent of the purchase price 
he or she must qualify financially to make the mortgage payments in 
the second year of the loan 
why the second year because banks savings institutions and 
other lenders typically promote arms with enticingly low rates for 
the first year 
after that the rate and the monthly payment in most cases 
changes according to prevailing trends in interest rates 
the lender typically specifies a cap on how much the 
interest rate can increase generally caps run at two percentage 
points in any one year and five or six points over the life of the 
loan 
thus to meet fannie maes or freddie macs standards a 
borrower putting less than 20 percent down and applying for an arm 
with an initial interest rate of 8 percent would have to be able to 
pay at a 10 percent interest rate in the loans second year 
whether this is a good idea or a bad one depends on your point 
of view in theory at least it stands to slam the door on the 
housing market for some wouldbe buyers who do not have the money 
to make substantial down payments 
just how many is hard to say freddie mac has figured that the 
limits will affect about 6 percent of all applicants for arms 
the limits certainly are not being applauded by builders who 
want customers to buy their wares and who are not usually involved 
in the mortgage part of the deal 
at the same time however the setting of standards for arms can 
be seen as a form of discipline on a financial product that is 
susceptible to overexuberant promotion if not downright abuse 
the bait of a very low firstyear interest rate can turn out to 
be poisonous for borrowers who do not anticipate how much the cost 
of their adjustable loans can increase with the passage of time 
its not such a bad idea when you think about it says tara 
little a spokeswoman for the american bankers association 
since arms first came into wide usage in the early 1980s they 
have been of great benefit in broadening the supply and 
availability of housing credit said charlotte sterling a 
spokeswoman for fannie mae but they have to be used prudently 
you dont do anybody any good at all by putting people in a 
house theyre not going to be able to pay for she asserted 
fannie maes and freddie macs standards it should be noted 
apply only to loans those organizations buy from banks and savings 
institutions 
dennis campbell senior vice president of marketing at fannie 
mae said many lenders issue arms that they do not intend to 
resell therefore he said homebuyers may well still be able to 
find such an institution that is willing to grant a mortgage with 
less stringent requirements 
however he said the trend in the mortgage business is toward 
more definitive standards for arms 
as jeannette bernay a spokeswoman for freddie mac put it we 
want to get people into homes but we also want to keep them there

actress cicely tyson will be looking for food for 
the soul while actor ossie davis says the first national black 
arts festival promises an opportunity for black artists to shine as 
never before 
black artists and audiences will feast on events ranging from 
the world premiere of pulitzer prizewinner charles fullers new 
play to a fancy footwork performance by the copasetics a group 
of the oldest tap dancers alive during the festival which begins 
july 30 and runs through aug 7 
hundreds of thousands of people are expected to view the 107 
performances and exhibits in eight artistic disciplines but miss 
tyson said she hoped the festival will have special impact on 
blacks in the audiences 
art for us in the black community is at the bottom of the 
ladder she said 
for too long weve just been trying to support our families 
put bread on the table roofs over our heads art just seems to 
have been given a back seat we are just learning to appreciate art 
and to understand it and to know it is just as important as food on 
the table its food for our souls 
the actress said she planned to see some of the paintings and 
sculptures on exhibit and take in a performance of sally by the 
negro ensemble company the worlds oldest professional black 
theater company the play is the latest effort by fuller who won a 
pulitzer prize for a soldiers play 
miss tyson whose work on the upcoming movie dessa rose will 
cut short her festival visit said she also hoped to see apollo 
it was just like magic a musical about the legendary harlem 
theater also premiering in atlanta 
apollo starring peabo bryson and patti austin is written 
directed and choreographed by george faison who won a tony award 
for the wiz 
i want to see a little bit of everything but im going to 
have to put on my running shoes to get it all in miss tyson said 
davis who will be host for a sevenhour evening of music and 
poetry called lyrics to live by on the last day of the 
festival said he also wondered just how much hell be able to 
sample hell miss the first few days while acting in spike lees 
new movie do the right thing 
davis said he feels a great deal of satisfaction from the 
increasing amount of work being offered black artists 
one of the reasons we havent had a black arts festival of 
this scope before is that weve not been able to get national 
attention from funding sources or the viewing audiences he said 
in an interview its only in the last 20 or 25 years that 
americans have started to take seriously the contributions of black 
artists 
we havent had the opportunity but now that we have the 
opportunity were going to shine 
black artists are getting the chance to strut their stuff in 
atlanta because five years ago michael lomax chairman of the 
fulton county board of commissioners and a former city of atlanta 
cultural affairs director decided atlanta needed a big festival 
my hope was that this would be for want of a better 
comparison a black spoleto he said referring to the spoleto 
festival usa in charleston sc but our festival is more 
urban less pristine than charleton but then so is atlanta 
that atlantas festival would showcase black talent is 
appropriate for a city with a thriving black arts community a 
black political power structure and a twothirds black population 
it is a cosmopolitan hub where the black community rubs 
shoulders with the best and most powerful of america and the 
world said davis a native of south georgia atlanta is a most 
appropriate venue and with the democratic convention just 
leaving it gives the city sort of a onetwo punch 
the 15 million festival will feature ticketed and free events 
in the disciplines of music dance film theater literary arts 
folk art visual art and performance art the events at 35 
locations around metropolitan atlanta range from big to small 
mainstream to experimental 
musical offerings will include an evening with pianist leon 
bates and the atlanta symphony orchestra two days of the atlanta 
jazz festival a gospel concert and a blues show on auburn avenue 
dance performances will include work by members of the alvin 
ailey american dance company bucket dance theatre the dunham 
childrens company and danceraerialist joanna haigood 
the georgia folklife festival at georgia state center for urban 
life will feature performances of blues jazz cajun music 
fiddling and rhythm and blues and exhibitions of quilting basket 
weaving netmaking boatbuilding and other crafts and traditional 
skills 
a series of films will be shown including a presentation of 
four films by 1920s independent black filmmaker oscar micheaux and 
a docudrama on his life starring danny glover 
among the exhibitions will be a show at the new visions gallery 
of contemporary art of a selection of 75 works by sculptor and 
printmaker elizabeth catlettmora her husband painter francisco 
mora and their son painter and sculptor david catlettmora 
also a juried exhibition open to black artists working in 
painting drawing sculpture photography mixedmedia graphics 
and video will be presented at the new gallery of the collections 
of life and heritage

long before there were trekkies a space 
odyssey or et philip jose farmer was entertaining a science 
fiction cult with erotic stories of humanalien love affairs and 
other fantastic tales 
his 67 books and short stories are enough to fill a bookcase and 
his honors including three hugo awards would make any writer 
proud 
but farmer 70 labors in near obscurity in a quiet 
uppermiddleclass neighborhood on peorias northwest side despite 
his success farmer hardly is recognizable in the town where he 
grew up attended college and returned to spend most of his adult 
life 
i am obscure in peoria farmer said recently as he sat 
surrounded by thousands of books which line the walls of his 
basement office i guess they dont read much around here 
but in the literary world of issac asimov ray bradbury robert 
heinlein and kurt vonnegut farmer is respected and admired 
farmer broke new ground in 1952 with his first published story 
called the lovers the story featured on the cover of 
startling stories caught the attention of science fiction world 
with the first serious treatment of sexuality the story was based 
on a love affair between an earth man and an alien woman and 
farmer rocked the science fiction community by dealing with sex in 
a frank manner 
at the time he was working full time at a peoria steel mill and 
writing on the side he received 25 rejection slips before selling 
the lovers 
not only did it launch his career but it inspired some of the 
greatest science fiction writers including heinlein whose classic 
stranger in a strange land was dedicated to farmer 
it was tough making a living writing science fiction in those 
days because the market wasnt very large farmer said but it 
was like a community the critics called it a ghetto whatever it 
was the writers all knew each other and we knew the fans and we 
all got along it was quite nice 
after 11 years at the steel mill farmer tried to survive as a 
fulltime freelance writer but finances forced him back to work as 
a technical writer in the defense industry in 1956 
i didnt like it but i had a wife and family to take care 
of he said 
he bounced from new york to arizona to california in the years 
from 1956 to 1969 before finally quitting to concentrate all his 
energies on his science fiction writing 
thats when we came back to peoria farmer said i hated 
the smog in los angeles and the traffic 
and hes stayed in this river city of 124000 ever since but he 
doesnt blame the setting for his failure to achieve the fame of 
asimov bradbury vonnegut or heinlein his writing career was 
troubled by disagreements with publishers and agents family 
illnesses and other distractions 
perhaps his only regret is not pushing harder to break into the 
tv writing business during his years in los angeles but farmer 
doesnt think he was cut out to write for television 
he said star trek producers rejected his ideas as too far 
out for the television audience and he chafed at a medium in 
which one was required to explain the premise of each adventure 
rather than letting viewers figure out the concept on their own 
but hes a fan of science fiction stories especially the movies 
sparked by the boom in science fiction 2001 a space odyessy 
the star wars trilogy et the extraterrestrial 
alien cocoon and back to the future 
and hes capitalizing on the science fiction craze with another 
new book soon to come out along with the rerelease in the fall of 
an older novel 
ive got enough ideas to keep going until im way past 100 
farmer said adding that while he appreciates the new mass appeal 
of science fiction he longs for the old days 
i miss the camaraderie from the science fiction ghetto he 
said we were a big family

businessmen in this 
freewheeling freetrading persian gulf port say an end to the 
iraniraq war is likely to mean an economic boom for the united 
arab emirates citystate 
it would be just like the klondike said stan robinson a 
mercedes benz car dealer 
dubai has combined modest oil income with a centuriesold 
merchant tradition to make itself the major port in the southern 
end of gulf the most important local trading partner of iran 
the dream is to be the hong kong of the 21st century said 
sultan ahmed bin sulayen chairman of dubais massive jebel ali 
free zone a 25 billion facility that includes what dubai says is 
the worlds largest manmade harbor 
the citystate is already a major transit point for cargo much 
of it heading across the gulf to iran that flow collapsed in the 
early years of the war and is just now recovering 
although dubai has weathered the war and a dropoff in oil 
revenues most businessmen believe the end of the war will be 
positive said daniel greenwald executive vice president of the 
american business council of dubai 
shipping officials in dubai who insisted on anonymity said 
that while dubai has gained revenues in repairing wardamaged 
ships it has lost business at its container ports and at shipyards 
you can go to a hell of a lot of places for a half a million 
dollars said one referring to the cost of warrisk insurance in 
the persian gulf for a big container ship 
greenwald said the war also has probably deterred some 
businessmen from making major investments in dubai 
many traders are also hoping dubais historic role as a transit 
route for iranian cargo will carry on as iran rebuilds after the 
war 
even during the war thousands of iranians a month fly to dubai 
international airport the busiest in the middle east to shop in 
dubais famed souks or markets the iran air jetliner downed by 
us navy missiles in early july was headed for dubai 
they come in the airport from bandar abbas they shop 
they load the dhows boats down they go back again said 
abdulla abulhoul foreign relations director for dubais chamber 
of commerce 
the waterfront is piled with new washing machines tires car 
parts and sometimes whole cars destined for iran aboard the 
handbuilt little wooden dhows that ply the gulf 
the iranians are part of an exotic mixture of visitors and 
expatriates from india pakistan the philippines and the west who 
outnumber dubais locals by at least 21 in the population of 
490000 
many of the foreigners are lured by dubais tolerance in an area 
where islamic law and customs predominate its highrise hotels 
feature britishstyle pubs lebanese nightclubs and japanese 
restaurants 
entertainment ranges from a grassy golf course to ice rinks 
complete with an ice hockey league 
dubai is also taxfree and relatively free of the redtape and 
oppressive security that dim the allure of many middle eastern 
countries 
its like utopia said robinson who is among dubais more 
enthusiastic backers 
but the lack of local labor means companies must import workers 
often from sri lanka or india at wages of 140 to 220 monthly for 
an unskilled worker 
dubais location midway between europe and the far east has made 
its airport one of the busiest transit points in the world 
its massive dry docks are booked months in advance for ship 
refittings despite the dangers of the gulf 
bin sulayim said dubai hopes by the end of this year to pass an 
offshorecompany law and is considering offshore banking a move 
that would place dubai in competition with the island nation of 
bahrain farther north in the gulf 
companies such as kodak general motors toyota and polaroid 
have established regional administrative or service centers here 
some responsible for territories stretching from greece in europe 
to kenya in africa to singapore in southeast asia 
you dont have to go down and persuade government officials 
why they want another business in town greenwald said 
trade is in the blood said bin sulayem he noted that when 
the united states banned imports of iranian pistachio nuts dubai 
traders bought huge quantities at depressed prices then processed 
and bagged them and exported them to america

a fleet of little wooden 
dhows dart daily past the supertankers and warships of the persian 
gulf carrying on a historic link between wartorn iran and arab 
dubai 
we bring lots of onions from iran watermelons any kind of 
food and fruits that we can said hossein a crewman who aboard a 
dhow docked at dubais busy waterfront 
stacked and strewn all along the dock were piles of tires boxed 
washing machines and automobile parts bicycles and bedsprings 
consumer goods destined for iran aboard dhows 
the handmade dhows have sailed the 150 miles from dubai to 
bandar abbas in iran for generations but with the iraniraq war 
the route has taken on added importance 
most of the other gulf countries except for dubai and kuwait 
have cut their trade links with iran so most of the stuff we 
bring here goes to the other gulf countries its sort of a 
collection point for us said capt avaz oveisi who has spent 34 
of his 62 years sailing dhows 
iranians by the thousands those who can find foreign currency 
fly into dubai to shop and send the goods back home by dhow 
if the goods are new the pattern isnt dubais ports and 
merchants once dealt in pearls and silk 
dubai is a trading place they were smuggling and trading with 
the rest of the world for centuries said daniel greenwald 
executive vice president of the american business council of dubai 
even in the days of container shipping greenwald said it can be 
very economical to use the little dhows which can tie up in 
small ports and unload their cargoes quickly 
the boats generally take eight to 12 hours to cross the gulf an 
arduous journey where temperatures can climb to 110 degrees or 
more with humidity at 90 percent 
its really tiring to work on a dhow all the day in all of the 
heat and to load and unload said abbas abassi a dhow 
crewman 
despite the dozens of warships cruising the gulf none of the 
dhow crewmen said they had been threatened although some said they 
were worried after a us ship shot down an iran air jetliner 
since the airplane has been hit were very scared but there 
hasnt been any real incident abassi said 
even if theyre scared they have to do it because this is the 
way they make money for their families

les paul sat on a stool at a basement jazz club 
on the lower east side the fingers of his left hand cascading down 
the neck of his guitar in soft precise steps 
at 73 the greatness of his guitar still draws laughs sighs and 
applause from audiences at fat tuesdays 
for the past four years he and his threepiece group have been 
playing clubs performing the same mellow standards paul has done 
for decades some of them via con dios how high the moon 
were songs made famous during his long partnership with his 
exwife the late singer mary ford from whom he was divorced in 
1962 
younger musical stars such as led zeppelins jimmy page dire 
straits mark knopfler and dutch guitarist eddie van halen come to 
pay tribute and sit in with a musician who did it first and who 
many believe still does it best 
in my lifetime the guitar hasnt changed enough to put in 
your hat paul said picking an imaginary guitar whether 
youre segovia or van halen you cant do anything unless you can 
do it here 
paul a musiciancomposerdesignerinventor is the acknowledged 
father of electronic music in 1937 he became the first major 
artist to play electric guitar when the 65 members of fred warings 
pennsylvanians big band voted unanimously to let paul play his 
amplified contraption 
suddenly it was recognized that power was a very important 
part of music he said in an interview to have the dynamics 
to have the way of expressing yourself beyond the normal limits of 
an unamplified instrument was incredible today a guy wouldnt 
think of singing a song on a stage without a microphone and a sound 
system 
but today there are a lot of parents who blame les paul for 
all the racket going on in their basement he said with a smile 
a reference to the thousands of teenagers whose love affair with 
the guitar is expressed in decibels 
for seven years in the 1950s paul and ford broadcast a tv show 
from their home in mahwah nj which the listerine co sponsor 
of the show bought for the couple to get them to move to new 
jersey from california 
it was with ford that paul developed twotrack recording known 
today as dubbing a process that revolutionized recording in the 
40s and is the backbone of studio work today 
the guitar that bears his name the les paul is a legend in its 
own right made by the gibson co of nashville the list of rock and 
fusion jazz musicians who choose to play it reads like a whos who 
of modern popular music blues master bb king pete townsend of 
the who steve howe of yes jazz great al dimeola led zeppelins 
page and paul mccartney who with pauls help designed his own 
custom version of the guitar 
in turn two generations of aspiring guitarists have saved their 
money for les pauls the most popular model today sells for between 
800 and 900 
it is the les pauls bigger fatter sound that attracted 
musicians back in the late 50s when the first of the classically 
inspired guitars was produced the les pauls innovation was the 
use of two doublecoiled pickups that reduced the twang of other 
guitars and gave the musician a broader range of sounds as the 
change the tone or volume on each pickup 
paul jernigan gibsons marketing director said sales figures 
for the guitar are kept confidential but the 12 les paul models 
continue to grow in popularity and the company now has six months 
worth of back orders 
the instruments main competition for nearly two decades has 
been the fender stratocaster a lighter guitar with a dramatic 
molded body the stratocaster or strat as it is commonly known 
has its own claim on guitar aristocracy jimi hendrix played a 
strat and burned several on stage eric clapton and robin trower 
both prefer the fenders 
ironically paul said most kids these days know what a les paul 
is but not who he is he also has mixed feelings about todays 
rock n roll and the way his guitar is now being used he hates 
distortion and electronic gimmicks theyre just ways of hiding 
what the guitarist cant do with these he said wiggling his 
fingers 
the first rock stuff i mean in the early 60s it was bad 
bad singers bad players bad everything but they went from three 
chords on guitar and by 1988 we now have some fantastic musicians 
in all fields there are some kids who can go into a music store 
and pick up a guitar today and play anything its shocking 
but one thing paul has not done is stop learning 
gibson has agreed to market a superguitar he is now 
designing which he said would sell for nearly 35000 he also is 
expecting a visit from mccartney at fat tuesdays for a 
performance though a date has not been set 
you can do anything in music as long as you can think it up 
he said thats a very exciting thing

if a second sequel follows this summers 
martinisoaked movie arthur 2 on the rocks it could very 
well be arthur 3 on the wagon 
once a motion picture staple the lovable screen lush may be 
drying up as hollywood adapts to the changing attitudes and tastes 
of the just say no 1980s 
since its premiere july 8 arthur 2 has been greeted by both 
caustic reviews and unspectacular box office results the films 
poor showing may signal a shift in audience tolerance for alcohol 
i really think that the public has had it said brian dyak 
president of the entertainment industries council which monitors 
hollywoods depiction of substance abuse people nowadays arent 
going to buy into the glorification of the alcoholic 
whats more a flurry of filmmakers is now betting that 
moviegoers are ready for unblinking looks at the darker side of 
drug use updates of 1945s the lost weekend unlike the giddy 
marijuana scenes from 1983s terms of endearment and 1985s 
the breakfast club these new films will take a decidely 
bleaker view of getting high 
in clean and sober opening aug 10 michael keaton plays a 
hotshot real estate broker whose career and personal life are 
ruined by cocaine addiction 
similar storylines are featured in the upcoming movies 
wired about john belushis death from a drug overdose the 
boost starring james woods as a highpowered salesman with a 
narcotic dependency and bird director clint eastwoods 
profile of alto sax superstar charlie parker who died at age 34 
after a life of drug abuse 
marketing the three films may prove difficult nevertheless it 
is increasingly clear that some movies which portray substance 
abuse in a positive light have been left wobbling from critical 
backlash in these more sober times 
i think in general sobriety is considered a more popular 
model now said paul moore development director for the scott 
newman center which is named for the late son of actor paul newman 
and bestows awards for realistic television portrayals of substance 
abuse how we looked at things in the 60s and 70s is very 
different from how we look at things in the 80s 
even cigarette use on screen according to the american cancer 
society is down 
those who dont keep current may suffer several reviewers have 
pounced on license to drive a comedy that stars corey haim and 
corey feldman as teenagers out to get their first driving 
licenses the problem with license to drive according to bob 
mondello a film critic for national public radio is that one of 
its longer scenes uses drunk driving for laughs 
my first reaction was how can these morons do this 
mondello said in an interview what kind of responsible filmmaker 
would write a movie like this and target it to kids we have heard 
about the dangers of drunken driving over and over and its 
impossible for us to take it lightly now 
license to drive has enjoyed only tepid business in theaters 
since arriving july 6 even teenagers mondello said arent 
laughing at the drunk driving 
meanwhile the summer boxoffice hit who framed roger rabbit 
seems to send out a mixed message on alcohol although the movies 
private eye eddie valiant bob hoskins abandons his bottle at 
films end the title character a cartoon figure escapes both 
depression and danger by gulping a glass of whiskey 
such cavalier images of alcohol use upset george marcelle 
public information officer for the national council on alcoholism 
there is a classic tradition of depicting drunks without 
showing the real effects marcelle said in the original 
arthur he was fallingdown drunk and the total negative effect 
we were shown were some hangovers 
in real life arthur would black out hed probably have some 
serious physical problems like high blood pressure liver disease 
or body shakes in the morning and hed be prone to throwing up and 
dry heaves marcelle said 
in arthur 2 the title character spends all but the final 
reel of the movie stumbling around in a drunken daze arthur says 
at movies end that he has stopped drinking but the only clear 
consequence of his constant intoxication is a temporary delay in 
his adoption of a baby 
when i first saw the preview for arthur 2 i said how can 
they do it said barney rosenzweig who as executive producer of 
televisons cagney amp lacey won wide praise for the shows frank 
chronicle of detective chris cagneys battle with alcoholism i 
think its in bad taste 
so consistent is the criticism of arthur 2 that moore has 
said his character may go sober should there be an arthur 3 
it just seems times and public attitude toward alcoholism have 
changed since we made arthur in 1981 moore told columnist 
marilyn beck 
liza minnelli moores costar in the movie and herself once 
hospitalized for chemical dependency defended arthur 2 
its a highly stylized kind of comedy minnelli said i 
dont know any real alcoholics who are as adorable as arthur in 
fact some of my friends who have the same disease i do think hes 
hysterical because he brings back memories when it was fun to 
drink 
there are indications some hollywood figures will continue to 
employ drug use for its supposed comic effect 
tommy chong half of the cheech marin and chong comedy team 
and star of the 1978 marijuana spoof up in smoke is now making 
far out man in it chong is still bonged out according to 
the films spokeswoman deborah brown 
he plays the same kind of character he has always played 
brown said chong appears in the movie wearing a just say no 
tshirt but the lettering has faded so it reads just say o 
television film critic roger ebert thinks audiences dont really 
care about social issues when they set out for the theater im 
inclined to believe that people go to a movie if they think theyll 
have a good time ebert said public attitudes on the subject 
matter are usually not germane to the box office i just saw the 
upcoming movie cocktail and tom cruise drinks in 85 percent of 
the films scenes and itll be a huge hit 
the movies have come a long way but they still have a long 
way to go said producer herman rush a contributor to the white 
house conference on a drugfree america report given to congress 
and the president in june 
among the reports recommendations was one advising filmmakers 
to avoid any positive portrayal of illicit drug use and another 
urging the motion picture association of america to employ the 
movie rating system to more effectively identify inappropriate 
depictions of illegal drug use the mpaa has repeatedly rejected 
an overhaul of its rating system 
in the end the judge of whats acceptable and whats not will 
likely be ticket sales 
if there is a reflection of the publics change in 
attitudes said rush it will be arthur 2s failure at the 
box office

amid the fir trees and hills of the 
klickitat valley larry and meg letterman are putting in a hot tub 
while waiting for disaster 
the lettermans are creators of ponderosa village a 1000acre 
intentional community whose residents hope to ensure their 
survival in the social upheavals they see on the horizon 
they say they are not survivalists not a religious cult and not 
a commune 
they are just people who are equipping their elaborate homes 
with bomb shelters and large stocks of food they value their 
distance from large urban areas where they sense disaster looming 
there is a greater chance of mishap and social disorder in the 
cities said the 67yearold letterman 
our emphasis is on being prepared for whatever might come down 
the pike said his wife whos 68 
something as simple as a truckers strike could bring chaos 
they contend 
the supply of food in larger cities is down from 2 days to 
11 days letterman said just a ripple in the trucking system 
could cause riots in large cities 
cities also breed disease stress pollution and political 
upheaval and would be targets in nuclear warfare say the 
lettermans 
to prepare they are developing a community where members would 
have their own stored food seeds water source medical supplies 
tools and means of selfdefense 
i dont want to give the impression were wearing robes and 
waiting for doomsday to come letterman said its not like 
that 
but part of the allure is that the southcentral washington 
development is 70 miles from yakima wash 120 miles from 
portland ore and 210 miles from seattle according to a brochure 
in a time of upheaval people will stream out of those cities 
heading into the country for safety they said 
access to ponderosa village is restricted by mountains 
rivers forest lands number of approach roads and entrances the 
brochure says making protection feasible 
ponderosa village built on a heavily forested hillside has the 
aura of a summer camp with its woodsided homes reddirt forest 
trails and whistling winds 
no weapons were evident when an ap reporter visited letterman 
said residents had agreed not to discuss weapons or food and 
equipment stockpiles leaving those to the discretion of individual 
families 
about 50 fiveacre parcels have been sold to people from places 
like long island ny seattle texas california and even 
switzerland letterman said undeveloped parcels cost 9000 to 
15000 
so far 13 families a total of 32 people have taken up 
residence in this development about five miles from goldendale 
population about 3500 
the lettermans say it is coincidence that they chose to locate 
just 100 miles north of rajneeshpuram the nowdisbanded commune 
where indian guru bhagwan shree rajneesh moved his sect in 1981 
unlike rajneesh the lettermans have drawn little attention 
there are a lot of good people who live up there said 
sheriff jim gleason who declined to say whether his office had 
received any complaints about the development 
steven anderson former county planner said the only complaints 
came from inside the development and involved internal regulations 
people were complaining that when they bought the lot they 
didnt understand the fine print said anderson now a private 
consultant 
one of the complainers was tim urchenko a former industrial 
engineer from dallas who was upset by rules restricting the 
cutting of trees 
i like the property and the people have been good except for 
the problem with all the rules said urchenko who now makes 
intricate boxes and sells them at craft shows 
when you come from the city you are living with all kinds of 
people around you and youre used to rules urchenko said but 
then you move out here and you think why do we need this 
the lettermans moved to the development from los altos calif 
in 1982 five years after acquiring the land for a sum they will 
not disclose 
since that time they have marked off 200 parcels put in roads 
and a water system bought a fire truck and built their own 
spectacular house 
the 3000square foot residence includes a new hot tub attached 
greenhouse satellite dish and a root cellar where they store 
everything from dried beans to champagne the earthcovered root 
cellar doubles as a bomb shelter 
the land is nearly paid off and all improvements have been paid 
for in cash so the remaining debt is small the lettermans said 
they recruit likeminded people through ads in magazines like 
mother earth news and mother jones they also advertise in new age 
religious publications they have been new age followers as are 75 
percent of the developments residents according to meg letterman 
people ask if this is a religious cult she said no but 
preparedness is its own religion 
there is a community meditation chapel as well as a stone 
gathering circle where residents occasionally get together to 
share beliefs she said 
prospective buyers are told they will be required to conform to 
the principles of selfreliance and to contribute to building 
community spirit the lettermans say they do not want people 
dependent on handouts 
instead they want people who can find work in area industries 
or who can create their own jobs current residents work in the 
nearby aluminum mill or as nurses printers computer analysts and 
in arts and crafts 
meg letterman was editor of national reporter a magazine 
published by the zero population growth organization while larry 
was an air force officer working with military satellites 
they wanted to escape cities but at the same time they were not 
interested in small towns which can be an ingrown tribal 
society where they would not be accepted letterman said 
we thought it was better to start some sort of a community 
with people with similar interests he said 
ponderosa village is not a backtotheearth commune 
while many people have their own vegetable gardens and orchards 
largescale farming is not possible the emphasis is on stocking 
canned and dried foods 
the houses are modernistic and elaborate some featuring 
geodesic dome designs and natural heating and cooling systems 
the lettermans provide a lending library with over 2000 titles 
many of them doityourself books 
the community is not utopian or communal but is held together 
by its families letterman said 
utopian is a fantasy or a dream he said you can come 
here and increase your awareness of life

in the dusty days of summer when 
temperatures hover above 100 degrees for days on end new delhi 
rejoices at the coming of the monsoon and its cooling rains 
in the west the rains are depressing in india they are a 
time of great joy release beauty and romance says khushwant 
singh a noted author and journalist 
as the rains come the dust settles parched gardens suddenly 
turn green temperatures come soothingly down and so do tempers 
but the monsoon has its sad side 
the rains that started early in july ended two years of drought 
in northern india promising good crops at last but they also 
unleashed floods that left scores of people dead 
for new delhi the downpour broke the stifling heat but 
telephones went dead potholes multiplied or grew deeper and 
disease became a danger as tainted water seeped into pipes and 
wells 
at the first delicious moment of the monsoon though the 
nourishing rain kept such troubles distant 
the monsoon for most indians is not only the source of 
life but also their most exciting contact with nature says 
authorjournalist singh 
when the clouds first burst open over new delhi dozens of 
halfnaked children danced gleefully in the downpour and splashed 
in puddles in one impoverished neighborhood along the yamuna river 
its always like this said gulab an elderly woman watching 
the fun the children love to play in the rain but they 
invariably get sick 
more than 5300 people have been treated this year for 
gastroenteritis and cholera in new delhi at least 75 have died 
most of them children 
maya rao a university teacher who has lived in new delhi for 
many years described new delhis monsoon this way 
there is muck and mud all over mosquitoes attack you in 
hordes diseases spread like vice its impossible to get to places 
on time given the state of the roads and calling people on the 
phone is such a nuisance half the phones are dead 
then she added theres the humidity 
the moment the rain stops you sweat to death 
even so ms rao went on she cant imagine life without the 
monsoon 
what could be more delightful than eating bhutta roasted 
cornonthecob on your terrace as the greypurple skies melt into 
rain 
one city official who insisted on anonymity said he could do 
no work during the monsoon 
its too beautiful just to relax sit and watch the rain he 
said as he sat watching the rain stream down his office window

oil futures prices have retreated amid 
skepticism that a possible ceasefire in the iraniraq war would 
soon reduce the world oversupply of crude 
the august contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude oil fell the most sharply tuesday settling 47 cents 
lower at 1523 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
traders said the contract for august delivery which expires 
wednesday was depressed partly by plentiful inventories of oil at 
us terminals the september contract which is less sensitive to 
shortterm inventories fell 26 cents at 1563 a barrel 
the market took a more realistic view today said andrew 
lebow an analyst at edampf man international futures inc in new 
york based on real fundamentals there still is a shortterm or 
maybe even intermediateterm oversupply of crude 
on monday the august contract for west texas intermediate had 
jumped 84 cents a barrel after iran said it would accept a united 
nations resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in its 
nearly 8yearold war with iraq 
the news raised the possibility that members of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries would be able to set aside their 
differences and agree to production cutbacks that would prop up 
prices 
but lebow said theres a lot of work to be done to get from 
the end of the war to opec production cutbacks 
i think that yesterdays rally was totally overdone said 
william byers an analyst at bear stearns amp co 
also depressing oil prices tuesday were reports that iraqi 
warplanes raided an unfinished nuclear plant and other iranian 
industrial targets war communiques from tehran said iranian 
warplanes retaliated by raiding a dam in iraq 
another factor hurting prices was an unconfirmed report that 
saudi arabia was selling oil from caribbean inventories to 
noncontractual customers at prices near the spot price lebow said 
the contract for august delivery of no2 heating oil up 215 
cents on monday fell 37 cent to 4290 cents a gallon on the new

digital equipment corp has thrown down a new 
challenge to international business machines corp with a claim 
that its computers can process transactions for onethird the cost 
of ibms 
digital made the claim tuesday in announcing a major thrust in 
the field of transaction processing a burgeoning computer industry 
segment in which ibm so far has dominated digital 
digital president kenneth olsen called transaction processing 
the fastestgrowing part of the business computer market and 
vowed to grab a bigger part of it analysts said the goal was 
realistic 
ibm meanwhile brought out three more powerful models of its rt 
workstation and an improved version of dos the operating system 
used on its original line of personal computers 
transaction processing is the kind of computing done by bank 
tellers airline reservation clerks and other people who need to 
interact closely with computers it is gradually shoving aside 
batch processing in which a computer churns through reams of work 
without interference 
digital said tests of its new systems showed they could process 
transactions for less than onethird the cost of ibm and half the 
cost of tandem computers inc 
ibm said it had not seen digitals claim and could thus not 
immediately respond 
david dempsey manager of corporate product marketing for 
tandem said im not worried it was an apples for oranges 
comparison 
the worldwide market for transaction processing 20 billion to 
30 billion a year probably will double in five years a digital 
executive told datamation magazine earlier this year 
ibm is the clear market leader in transaction processing 
accounting last year for 485 percent of the systems installed at 
almost 7000 minicomputer sites across the country vs 66 percent 
for digital according to a survey last summer by datamation and 
cowen amp co 
other rivals for digital are unisys corp hewlettpackard co 
tandem and wang laboratories inc 
but the products announced tuesday could help even the score for 
digital digital unveiled a range of services and products 
including software monitors and datastorage devices that make 
its existing line of computers better at transaction processing 
digital has been in transaction processing for a long time 
and is among the largest suppliers to the market olsen said in a 
written statement but our customers are asking us to do more 
craig symons an analyst for gartner group in stamford conn 
said digitals offerings are unusually strong because they are 
effectively knitted into the companys existing product line 
symons said digital seemed to be accurate in its claims about 
its cost advantage against ibm but he said ibms disadvantage 
would lessen somewhat through the use of a new version of its db2 
database management software 
ibm said all three new models of its rt workstation use a 
processor that provides up to 25 percent better performance than 
the processor used in their predecessor the computers are intended 
mainly for science and engineering although ibm says they can also 
be used for general business 
in the personal computer area ibm had promised last year to 
keep improving dos even after it introduced its operating system2 
but this was the first evidence of it also tuesday ibm announced 
a july 29 availability date for the extended edition of its 
operating system2 which bundles together various communications 
and data management features 
ibm and microsoft corp simultaneously introduced the new 
version of dos which has easytouse screen features such as menus 
and graphics the version named dos 40 can also handle larger 
data files and more main memory the price is 150 or 95 for 
people upgrading from an older version of dos

the greatest impact on the economy during the next six months

deficit 49 percent some 38 percent said inflation would have a 
big impact and 37 percent pointed to the november general election

the dollar fell against major currencies in early 
european trading today amid fears dollar selling by central banks 
would continue 
gold prices jumped 9 an ounce in zurich and 8 in london and 
silver prices also surged 
dealers said fears that european central banks again would 
intervene to sell dollars and the belief that the dollars recent 
rise was overextended dampened bullish dollar sentiment in the 
market 
the us trade imbalance is certainly improving but everyone 
knows a rapid rise in the dollar will only break that process 
said a dealer in milan italy 
he predicted the dollar would continue to trade within a narrow 
range 
in tokyo the dollar fell 080 japanese yen to a closing 13305 
yen later in london it edged up to 13322 yen 
in london the british pound rose to 17110 from 16937 late 
tuesday 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late tuesdays 
quotes included 18475 west german marks down from 18640 
15320 swiss francs down from 15475 62325 french francs down 
from 62845 20825 dutch guilders down from 21010 136850 
italian lire down from 138360 and 11960 canadian dollars down 
from 12011 
the sudden leap in precious metals prices apparently was sparked 
by a combination of a lower dollar and a miners strike in peru 
they said 
gold opened in london at a bid price of 44425 a troy ounce up 
from 437 bid late tuesday at midmorning today the citys five 
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of 445

when the index jumped 90175 points 
after opening at 2733072 points the nikkei index declined 
further in the morning because of additional selling by investors

electronics and hightech shares instead of their old favorites 
steel and shipbuilding the exportoriented shares led the 
market in the afternoon as it ragained most of what it lost tuesday 
todays market trends indicate goodbye to steels and 
shipbuildings and hello to electronics and hightechs said 
ichitaro watanabe of nikko securities with the yens slight 
depreciation investors found exportoriented electronics shares 
worth betting on it seems as though most of those who sold steel 
shares yesterday bought electronics today

moved in a range of 1329013335 yen in a slow trading 
exchange dealers said the dollar was on the way up in early 
morning trading after a 136 yen drop in new york overnight but 
profittaking prevented the currency from rising 
many players were holding up on selling dollars until it moved 
up to upper 133s said a dealer at a us investment bank in 
tokyo speaking on condition of anonymity but it never got that

inventor russell emanis believes he has a solution 
to the suzuki samurais reported instability problem that caused 
sales to plummet and forced the company to cut its price to dealers 
by 2000 to revive sales 
emanis 26 a samurai owner said that for 195 he can expand 
the samurai wheelbase to make the vehicle safer 
he is manufacturing a 5stud steel doughnut that bolts to 
the hub the vehicles regular tire and wheel then bolts to the 
doughnut 
emanis claims his device improves the samurais stability and 
all but eliminates what he says is the vehicles characteristic 
skitter on moderatespeed turns 
were not trying to tell suzuki what to do or how to run its 
business but we cant see anyone there is doing anything to 
help emanis said 
what weve done is make the vehicle handle better and feel 
more solid it makes steering tighter it adds unsprung weight 
below the center of gravity 
national sales of the fourwheeldrive samurai dropped 706 
percent in june from a year earlier after consumer reports magazine 
claimed the vehicle was prone to roll over if a driver swerved back 
and forth to avoid an accident 
suzuki officials say their vehicle is at least as stable as any 
other fourwheeldrive rig in similar situations 
jennifer astle of rogers amp associates suzukis public relations 
firm said she was unaware of any plans by suzuki to improve 
stability or of any accessory on the horizon that would do so 
last week brea califbased american suzuki motor corp told 
dealers it would cut 2000 off the price they pay for samurais 
sold through sept 2 and allowed dealers to decide how to use the 
money 
most are passing the cuts on to consumers through price 
reduction rebate or using it as a down payment the samurai has a 
suggested base retail price of 8235 
emanis who plans to have his invention tested when new vehicle 
outriggers are made said the package of four disks weighs a 
total of 62 pounds and extends the cars track 3 inches to 546 
inches 
the dodge raider has a factory wheel track of 541 inches the 
ford ranger trucks is 546 inches and the isuzu troopers is 547 
inches he said 
emanis of morrison colo said he and his partner gretchen 
born developed the product when his primary suzuki accessory a 
hard top came onto the market the day the bad publicity started 
for the samurai he has also developed a roll bar for the samurai 
were not trying to make a fortune he said but we are 
trying to help the market obviously so our mainline business can 
get back to work

supply are viewed as inflationary 
the report was disappointing but ignored said one equity

caveats and special circumstances 
another dealer said the market had prepared itself for really 
horrendous money supply figures

the drought and heat causing financial 
hardship for farmers are a boon to the nations coal industry 
which expects the abnormal weather to help make 1988 a record year 
its unfortunate that something that can have such a severe 
impact on one part of the economy can help another but thats 
whats happening here said john grasser of the national coal 
association 
were very sympathetic toward farmers he said but with 
conditions being what they are we happen to benefit 
the trade associations economic committee released a revised 
estimate tuesday setting coal production at 926 million tons this 
year 9 million tons more than a record set last year 
in its midyear forecast the committee also said domestic 
consumption of 932 million tons including imported coal would 
exceed last years record by 15 million tons 
the association initially estimated sales and production at or 
below 1987 levels however committee member david mackenzie 
director of strategic planning for the indianapolisbased amax coal 
co said the midyear revisions reflect unexpected demands caused 
by weather 
with lowwater conditions in the pacific northwest 
particularly utilities that normally use hydroelectric power have 
had to turn to coalfired generators he said theres also 
been increased use of air conditioning and that pushes up the 
demand for coal 
john tellmann vice president of marketing for mapco coal inc 
of tulsa okla said the committee expects abnormal weather 
conditions to boost utilities coal usage by 7 million to 10 
million tons 
most of the demand increase is going to be for western coal 
because they supply the utilities out there that cant use hydro 
tellmann said 
east of the mississippi river we dont expect a significant 
increase he said 
in its forecast the association projected a 29 percent 
increase in the gross national product this year and said a 
healthierthanexpected economy also played a role in changing its 
expectations 
the group said coal consumption by electric utilities should 
total 733 million tons up 15 million tons from 1987 and that 
there is a better than 50 percent chance that consumption at 
utilities could be even greater 
it projected consumption of 38 million tons of metallurgical 
coal that used in steel production for an increase of 1 million 
tons from last year and said industrial consumption should remain 
steady at 82 million tons

most soybean futures opened sharply lower today 
on the chicago board of trade as scattered showers brought relief 
to the droughtstricken farm belt for the fifth day in a row grain 
prices were narrowly mixed 
the opening drop in soybean prices followed two days of steep 
declines and reflected a growing feeling among traders that the 
drought has been broken analysts said 
theres a possibility we wont see a return to hot and dry 
conditions any time soon said walter spilka grain analyst in 
new york with smith barney harris upham amp co 
its a mixed call right now but theres a possiblity we might 
see more showers later on in the weekend and thats got a lot of 
people thinking the markets have topped and will head lower 
spilka said 
the rain came too late to revive the corn crop in most states 
but its just what the soybeans needed as that crop enters a 
critical growth stage he said 
in early trading wheat was 2 cents lower to cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in july at 375 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 2 cents higher with july at 308 a bushel oats were 
2 cents to 4 cents lower with september at 290 a bushel

of boston corp three of the nations largest banking companies 
said wednesday they earned profits in the second quarter after 
reporting sharp losses a year ago due to the third world debt 
crisis 
bankers trust the eighth largest bank holding company in terms 
of assets said net income for the quarter totaled 1741 million 
or 218 a share compared with a 554 million loss in 1987 
for the first half of 1988 the company earned 3001 million 
or 379 a share vs a loss of 4297 million a year earlier

loss for the first half it netted 1604 million compared with a

all three banks were among several banking companies to suffer 
huge losses or profit declines last year after making hefty 
additions to their loanloss reserves for potentially uncollectible 
loans to developing nations 
the additions followed brazils decision to suspend interest 
payments on most of its foreign bank debt and the rise of 
concessionary debt repayment plans negotiated by several third 
world countries 
brazil has since repaid some of the interest owed and this year 
most major banks have substantially curtailed their loanloss 
provisions 
bankers trusts provision for credit losses during the second 
quarter of 1987 had totaled 700 million the latest provision for 
credit losses amounted to 5 million 
los angelesbased first interstate said that in the second 
quarter 847 million was provided for possible loan losses vs 
7953 million in 1987 
bank of bostons provision for credit losses was 36 million for 
the quarter compared with 325 million last year

takeover issues 
some bargain hunters were lured to the market after two days of 
declining stock prices but analysts noted that institutional 
buying did not make much of a mark on the day 
in addition to computertriggered buy programs a handful of 
issues that are the subject of takeover bids or rumored to be 
takeover targets accounted for a substantial amount of trading 
volume trading strategies designed to capture dividends also added 
to the days volume analysts said 
theres not the intense institutional trading weve become 
accustomed to said philip puccio a senior vice president at 
dillon read amp co theres a lot of cash on the sidelines and 
institutions are not in any rush to plunge into the market

the road

the british government said wednesday it intends 
to privatize the countrys water industry in a stock offering 
expected to raise the equivalent of 86 billion 
shares in britains 10 regional water authorities will be 
offered to the public in a single 5 billion pound sale at the end 
of 1989 said nicholas ridley the governments environment 
secretary 
ridley said the government has not decided whether it will 
retain a 49 percent stake or a smaller interest in the companies 
that will be created from the existing water authorities 
ridley said 28 socalled statutory water companies which supply 
water to the authorities will be allowed to convert into 
autonomous public companies when the authorities are privatized 
these companies currently operate under a range of legal 
restrictions 
french water companies and some of the british water authorities 
already have acquired stakes in the statutory companies 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government has 
sold off billions of pounds worth of stateowned companies since 
1979 it believes these companies such as british airways plc and 
british gas plc are more efficiently run privately 
it also has sought to get more shares into the hands of the 
public as a way of promoting capitalism

gte corp is cutting back in the expensive and 
competitive business of building telephone network switches by 
turning over 49 percent of its operation to american telephone amp 
telegraph co 
gte will own 51 percent of a joint venture with atampt then 
reduce its ownership to 20 percent after five years and zero after 
15 years under an agreement in principle announced by the 
companies wednesday 
the venture will consist of gtes network switching business 
which employs about 2000 workers in the phoenix ariz area and 
about 3000 in factories in the chicago suburbs of northlake and 
genoa ill 
atampt will give the joint venture licenses to use some of atampts 
own advanced switching technology it will continue to run its own 
network switching business independently of the joint venture 
atampt dominates the us market for network switches which are 
basically computers installed in the central offices of phone 
companies that are loaded with complex software to handle hightech 
communications 
the newest switches are being upgraded at enormous expense to 
handle simultaneous transmission of voices computer data video 
signals and other information over the same circuits 
the deal eases gte out of a costly business where it has been an 
alsoran with about 10 percent of the market consisting mainly of 
the gte local phone companies said john bain an analyst for 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
financial arrangements were not disclosed but since gtes 
contribution is substantially larger it is reasonable to assume 
that atampt will be making some kind of payment to gte gte spokesman 
thomas mattausch said 
gtes customers should benefit because the joint venture will 
work on enhancing gte switches using the latest in atampt technology 
the companies said the companies switches happen to be similar 
so there is plenty of room for sharing of technology mattausch 
said 
in the long term atampt is likely to steer gte customers toward 
atampt switches bain predicted 
gte has reduced its involvement in other parts of the 
communications equipment business in recent years by entering joint 
ventures with west germanys siemens ag and japans fujitsu ltd 
itt corp following a similar pattern reduced its involvement 
in the network switching business at the end of 1986 by placing its 
telecommunications equipment business in a europeanbased joint 
venture with frances compagnie generale delectricite

growth in personal income slowed in all but 
three states during the first three months of 1988 barely keeping 
ahead of inflation the government said wednesday 
the commerce department said growth in income in the 50 states 
and the district of columbia slowed to 08 percent in the 
januarymarch period compared with growth of 28 percent in the 
final quarter of 1987 
despite the slowdown incomes managed to stay slightly ahead of 
the increase in prices which was 06 percent in the first quarter 
for personal consumption spending 
income in the 12 months ending march 31 expanded by 63 percent 
while inflation was 38 percent 
analysts attributed part of the cooling in the first quarter to 
swings in farm subsidy payments but other factors cited include 
slower job growth in the januarymarch period after a strong 
fourth quarter 
a decline in investment income as the federal reserve loosened 
the reins on the money supply pushing interest rates to their 
lowest point so far this year 
an increase in bonuses and other payments to employees at the 
end of the year which made first quarter growth look less robust 
by comparison 
mark zandi director of state forecasting for the wefa group a 
bala cynwyd pa forecasting firm said the pattern of faster 
growth on the east and west coasts than in the nations heartland 
continued in the first quarter but was less pronounced than in the 
past 
incomes in the first quarter grew 11 percent in the far west 
and southeast and 09 percent in new england and the midatlantic 
states in the inland regions incomes fell 12 percent in the 
plains states edged up 05 percent in the southwest and rose 07 
percent in both the great lakes and rocky mountain regions 
we are starting to see more balanced regional growth zandi 
said the breadbasket of the country and the oilproducing states 
were suffering from very severe recessions although not growing as 
fast as the coasts i wouldnt characterize them as suffering from 
recession any longer 
rudolph e depass a commerce department analyst noted that the 
improvement in us export sales is bolstering growth in regions 
where manufacturing is important however the west coast and 
southeastern states have been helped more than the socalled rust 
belt ringing the great lakes 
zandi said the paper plastics and textile industries of the 
southeast have been faster to see the benefits of the trade 
turnaround than plants in the great lakes that produce durable 
goods like heavy equipment and autos 
income dropped in six states edged up in 42 states and the 
district of columbia and showed no growth in two in all but three 
states oklahoma idaho and montana income either fell or its 
growth slowed from the fourth quarter 
residents of montana saw their incomes shoot up by 6 percent 
over the last three months of 1987 the biggest increase of any 
state income in north dakota jumped 41 percent although growth 
was still less strong than the fourth quarter while income in 
oklahoma rose 24 percent and was up 23 percent in idaho 
nebraska had the biggest decline 6 percent followed by iowa 
42 percent and south dakota 26 percent 
other states suffering declines or no growth were alaska down 
11 percent minnesota down 08 percent colorado down 04 
percent and texas and utah both with no change 
the payment of corn subsidies at the end of last year made first 
quarter income look worse in nebraska iowa and minnesota while 
payment of wheat subsidies early this year boosted income in 
montana north dakota idaho and oklahoma 
barley subsidies were an important factor in raising income in 
montana and idaho while cotton payments helped oklahoma which was 
hurt by weak oil prices 
excluding farm income nevada showed the strongest growth 2 
percent followed by vermont and virginia 17 percent each 
alaska the only state where nonfarm incomes declined slipped 
10 percent oklahoma showed no growth while texas and colorado 
edged up only 01 percent weak oil prices were blamed for the poor 
performance of incomes in those states which are heavily dependent 
on oil drillin and mining 
overall personal income excluding farm payments rose 1 percent 
in the 50 states compared with 24 percent growth in the fourth 
quarter over the 12 months ending march 31 nonfarm income grew 
65 percent

manufacturers failed to meet commitments for aircraft deliveries 
which caused amrs capacity to fall below expectations increased 
its unit costs and reduced its revenue

pratt amp whitney aircraft said 
wednesday it is eliminating more than 1000 whitecollar jobs in a 
move that will eventually save 100 million a year and enhance its 
competitive position in the jet engine market 
the company said 283 employees ranging from engineers and 
purchasing agents to vice presidents would be laid off over the 
next 18 months including 158 who were let go immediately 
the rest of the jobs including 314 currently vacant positions 
will be eliminated through attrition and not renewing 181 personnel 
contracts 
two more rounds of job reductions among the companys 19370 
salaried employees will be announced next month said curtis linke 
a pratt amp whitney spokesman 
the first round of reductions will eventually save the company 
an estimated 100 million a year he said 
cost reductions are difficult but eliminating unnecessary 
tasks and the reduction of staff are steps we must take to ensure a 
healthy future for pratt amp whitney and all our people company 
president arthur e wegner said in a statement 
pratt amp whitney a subsidiary of united technologies corp of 
hartford conn has said a number of times over the past year that 
it needed to lay off employees to remain competitive with its chief 
rival general electric co 
pratt amp whitney has about 45700 salaried and hourly employees 
worldwide compared to 44720 in 1982 
its nothing dramatic said david franus an analyst at 
forecast international in newtown a market research firm that 
follows the aerospace industry it is part of an ongoing attempt 
by pratt amp whitney to pare its staff down just to be leaner and 
meaner and more cost effective with ge 
philip friedman an analyst with drexel burhnam lambert inc in 
new york said the company for some time has been cutting costs 
and restructuring certainly it will make them more competitive 
in the jet engine market 
also on wednesday another utc division hamilton standard of 
windsor locks announced wednesday that about 200 hourly workers 
and 20 salaried employees are being laid off hamilton standard 
makes space systems 
once the worlds dominant jet engine builder pampw saw its share 
of the commercial market drop from 100 percent in 1974 to about 40 
percent in 1987 general electrics share grew during the same 
period from nothing to 45 percent to 50 percent 
similar declines have occurred in pratt amp whitneys military 
business 
general electrics pretax profit margin on engines is about 16 
percent compared to 8 percent for pampw analysts have said 
pratt amp whitney said it is rebounding however with orders this 
year running double the rate of last year 
the first round of job reductions announced wednesday affects 
the companys commercial business in east hartford linke said the 
government engine business in west palm beach fla and 
manufacturing operations in connecticut columbus ga and 
berwick maine will be affected in future job reductions linke 
said 
the salaried employees laid off wednesday will receive two 
weeks pay plus one week of severance pay for every year of 
service and a 3000 lumpsum payment 
pratt amp whitney used retirement and severance incentives last 
year to reduce its whitecollar work force by about 2000 
wegner told analysts late last year that further reductions in 
the work force were planned in order to bring the size of the 
company in line with a reduced production volume 
pratt amp whitney attempted last year to reopen contract 
negotiations with the machinists union so it could offer retirement 
incentives and improved severance pay for workers laid off in the 
future 
workers rejected the idea linke said wednesday that there was 
no evaluation of bluecollar staff now going on the machinists 
current contract expires in december 1988 the union represents 
18000 workers at pratt amp whitney and hamilton standard in 
connecticut

been laid off by pratt amp whitney in the past year have been called 
back

quarter increased 26 percent to 1962 million or 150 per share

issues that are the subject of takeover bids and those rumored to 
be takeover targets accounted for a substantial amount of trading

noted that the while bluechip issues managed to post gains the

general dynamics corp on wednesday reported a 
47 percent decrease in secondquarter earnings due in part to 
costs in its electric boat division 
for the second quarter its profit amounted to 667 million or 
158 a share on net sales of 234 billion compared with net 
earnings of 1251 million or 292 a share a year earlier

billion compared iwth net earnings of 2305 million or 537 a 
share on net sales of 466 billion for the same six months in 
1987 
earnings for both periods were boosted by 20 million from tax 
law changes resulting in reductions of deferred taxes the defense 
contractor said 
the secondquarter results included a charge of 33 million 
after taxes associated with the ssn 688class attack submarine 
program at electric boat division the company said 
the company said costs of operations at electric boat division 
have been rising since the first quarter of 1987 mostly because of 
problems associated with the installation of a new integrated 
combat system in the attack submarine and to higher overhead rates 
because the company did not win any submarine awards in fiscal 1987 
the company said the divisions secondquarter charge reflected 
losses from resolution of the companys request for equiptable 
adjustment associated with the design and installation of the new 
combat system from higher costs of rescheduling work into future 
periods and from the strike by 10000 shipyard workers at the 
groton conn facility which is now in its third week

rain in the farm belt sent soybean futures prices plunging the 
permissable limit again wednesday on the chicago board of trade but 
analysts said a new forecast for a return to hot dry weather could 
end the slide at three days 
in other action on the board of trade oat futures fell sharply 
wheat was lower and corn was mixed 
on other markets sugar prices plummeted silver rose while gold 
fell livestock and meat were mostly lower and energy futures 
advanced 
prices for some soybean contracts and nearly all oat contracts 
fell their permissable limits as scattered rain fell in parts of 
indiana illinois and arkansas marking the fifth straight day that 
showers had touched some part of the midwest 
the precipitation came too late to save much of the corn crop 
but for soybeans the rains came right at the right exact time 
and in areas where they needed it said walter spilka an analyst 
in new york with smith barney harris upham amp co 
he said soybean farmers in the south finished planting last week 
while the midwestern soybean crop has begun forming pods 
the most critical period for soybean growth will occur from 
midaugust through early september when the pods fill with beans 
said mario balletto soybean analyst in new york with merrill lynch 
capital markets inc 
the podfilling is really like the last chance balletto 
said thats when youve got to have the weather if youve got any 
chance of getting decent yields 
hot dry weather will return to most of the midwest by the 
middle of next week the national weather service predicted in a 
6to10day forecast issued after the close 
balletto said the forecast could have a bullish impact on crop 
futures on thursday 
corn futures fell sharply in early trading but recovered to 
close mixed on news that the american farm bureau had reduced its 
cornproduction estimate to 45 billion bushels from 48 million 
wheat futures prices were pressured by disappointment that some 
expected export business with china and india had failed to 
materialize spilka said 
wheat settled 4 cents to 11 cents lower with july at 365 a 
bushel corn was 16 cents lower to 5 cents higher with july at 
292 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 20 cents lower with july at 
270 a bushel soybeans were unchanged to 45 cents lower with 
july at 829 a bushel 
soybean prices are limited to moves of 45 cents a bushel and 
oats are limited to 15 cents a bushel except for the july 
contracts on which the limits have been removed pending the 
expiration of those contracts at noon on thursday 
world sugar prices collapsed on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange on unconfirmed rumors that the soviet union would not make 
any additional sugar purchases before their october harvest said 
judith ganes an analyst in new york with shearson lehman hutton 
inc 
the soviets are believed to have purchased as much as 200000 
metric tons of sugar last week she said traders expected them to 
buy another 500000 metric tons before october 
the contract for october delivery settled 113 cents lower at 
1417 cents a pound 
fears that a twoday miners walkout in peru could become an 
indefinite strike propelled silver futures prices sharply higher on 
new yorks commodity exchange 
the strike began monday night and the government has refused to 
budge on the workers demands for higher wages said bernard 
savaiko metals analyst with painewebber inc in new york 
peru is the worlds secondlargest silver producer behind mexico 
gold settled 130 to 180 lower with august at 44570 a troy 
ounce silver was 93 cents to 10 cents higher with july at 7827 
a troy ounce 
lower cash prices and lower soybean futures prices pressured 
most livestock and meat futures on the chicago mercantile exchange 
analysts said 
hog futures were hit particularly hard on expectations that the 
midwestern rains and cooler temperatures would prompt increased 
marketings 
live cattle were 63 cent lower to 33 cet higher with august at 
6420 cents a pound feeder cattle were 53 cent lower to 10 cent 
higher with august at 7557 cents a pound hogs were the limit 150 
cents lower to 55 cent higher with july at 4720 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 115 cents lower to 05 cent higher with 
july at 3575 cents a pound 
oil futures advanced in volatile trading on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 4 cents to 47 cents higher 
with august at 1560 cents a barrel heating oil was 120 cents to 
175 cents higher with august at 4465 cents a gallon unleaded

in the nearby los angeles suburb of toluca lake 
disney spends his spare time with his wife patricia and four 
grown children and as the handson skipper of his 70foot racing 
sloop pyewacket 
disney is a regular entrant in the transpacific sailing race 
from california to hawaii finished third this year in the memorial 
day california cup race and is a respected competitor said frank 
gleberman commodore of the california yacht club in marina del rey 
there are owners who go along for the ride and there are
