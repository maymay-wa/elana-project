in an adventure with almost as many twists and 
plot turns as the movie itself ayn rands we the living is 
about to make it to american theaters the 46yearold film was 
thought to have been destroyed by mussolini 
we the living was made in wartime italy in 1942 and was 
based on the novel of the same name by ayn rand whose 
objectivism philosphy in such works as the fountainhead and 
atlas shrugged made her a cult figure in the 1970s 
the movie has caused a stir over the years and has repeatedly 
won critical acclaim from the venice festival of 1942 to the fourth 
annual boston film festival last month 
a surface indictment of communism the lushly photographed 
romantic saga is set in russia as the tidal wave of revolution 
boiled down to a new party system that meant enormous changes in the 
way people lived and loved and survived 
rossano brazzi costars as a tubercular aristocat who cant get a 
job or a slot in a sanitarium because aristocrats are out of 
fashion he said he made arrangements for rand to get her first look 
at the film when he met her in hollywood after the war however he 
didnt think italys fascist government had ordered the movie to be 
destroyed 
it went out of circulation because the natural life of the film 
was over brazzi said in a telephone interview from his home in 
rome 
but massimo ferrarasantamaria a rome lawyer who was general 
manager of the studio where the movie was made said he was called 
before a fascist tribunal and ordered to destroy negatives and 
copies of the film and was stripped of his position at the studio 
and as lecturer at italian universities for his role in making the 
movie 
in the tragic italian war situation the film was called by the 
public noi morti we the dead he said in an interview 
adding that nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels banned the film 
in germany after ferrara personally showed it at goebbels berlin 
home in october 1942 
at the end of the screening goebbels told me that the russians 
were habitually presented to the german public in a much more 
negative way than in this picture and therefore it was no good for 
germany he said 
erika and henry mark holzer the movies producers were rands 
lawyers in the 1960s mrs holzer said the author believed the 
banning story and authorized a search for the film that took the two 
attorneys through hundreds of interviews and dusty archives it 
finally culminated two years later when they met a dealer with a 
bunch of italian films for sale 
they rode through the bumpy back streets of rome with a load of 
potentially explosive nitratetreated film in the back of an old 
truck including the negative for we the living they had the 
movie transferred to safety film before flying it back to new 
york 
mrs holzer believes they found the original nitrate negative 
which ferrara had hidden 
ferrara and others say italys ministry of culture ordered the 
film destroyed about five months after its release on the grounds 
that though the message might purport to be anticommunist it could 
also be taken as antitotalitarian a strong statement for 
individualism regardless of political coloration 
the fascists didnt want that kind of propaganda message playing 
on the homefront with italys axis troops stretched from north 
africa to stalingrad and the allies storming the beaches of sicily 
rand had a hardline libertarian philosophy it was best 
exemplified by gary cooper in the fountainhead who played an 
architect who blows up his own creation rather than allow it to be 
desecrated by the whims of popularism 
mrs holzer said rand liked the film version of we the living 
even more than the fountainhead although the author had written 
the latters screenplay herself and was not asked for permission for 
the italian film 
brazzi said it was a socalled war movie well worry after the 
war about paying for it he said rand eventually did receive 
compensation from scalera the producing studio 
mrs holzer said that once she and her husband recovered an 
original nitrate negative rand went through the film frame by frame 
to identify exactly how she wanted it edited the italian version 
was made in two parts and ran over 4 hours the project was set 
aside when rand had other commitments and was not picked up until 
after the authors death in 1982 the film was restored by duncan 
scott 
the epic was shot entirely on indoor elaborately built italian 
wartime sets recreating russian country scenes trains ships and 
petrograd 
im told almost the entire white russian community in italy was 
used as extras mrs holzer said 
the new version distributed by angelika films is under three 
hours and is set for release nov 5 in boston nov 11 in los 
angeles and nov 25 in new york it will play to other major us 
markets before january 
the film also stars a young and radiant alida valli the female 
lead in the 1949 british thriller the third man and fosco 
giachetti who was the no 1 boxoffice draw in italy when the movie 
was made according to its producers 
we the living has a bit of soap opera in it beautiful kira 
loves leo the tubercular aristocat andrei of the dreaded secret 
police loves kira because she has the courage to be independent and 
defiant of the new order 
but underneath the suds is a hard reality kira forsakes her love 
when he turns out not tough enough to toe a moral line andrei kills 
himself when he realizes first that kira used him to get leo a spot 
in a sanitarium and that his adored party leaves no freedom for 
individuals to decide whether they wish to be scoundrel or saint 
kira goes forward wiser but unbowed a testimony to the strong 
and the living and the survival of the toughest 
rand who espoused a personal philosophy based on unfettered 
capitalism and rational selfishness held individual freedom as 
the highest ideal she said alturism was weakness and blamed it for 
much of the worlds woes but she also attacked libertarians of the 
right who often identified with her philosophy

a scientist in a white lab coat scraped bits of 
cancer tissue from a white mouse into two sterilized glass dishes 
two young men in slightly scruffy street clothes sat on stools in 
front of the dishes each extended his right hand over a dish 
closed his eyes and concentrated 
they are giving off qi whispered the scientist immunologist 
gu ligang 
the experiment a hybrid of modern scientific method and seeming 
magic is part of a growing effort among chinese scientists to 
verify and analyze what many chinese believe to be a special human 
energy called qi 
the belief in qi is central to traditional chinese medicine but 
it is viewed skeptically by western scientists 
in this case the two men giving off qi were attempting to kill 
the cancerous cells in the dishes 
popular interest in qi and 2000yearold exercises to develop 
it called qigong is sweeping china after the method had been 
suppressed for decades as superstition an estimated 50 million 
adults practice qigong exercises while hospitals schools and 
scholarly institutes across china are researching qi 
qigong is a national cultural treasure and an integral part of 
chinese traditional medicines theoretical system and healing 
methods vice minister of health hu ximing told a recent 
conference in beijing of nearly 600 scientists and qigong masters 
from more than a dozen countries 
qi the chinese word for air and gas has a special meaning in 
medicine the breath of life 
chinese traditional medicine teaches that qi flows through the 
body in invisible channels like veins and that illness is a result 
of blockages in its flow traditional healing techniques from 
herbal medicines to acupuncture to qigong are efforts to restore 
the distribution of qi 
gu ligangs experiment with the cancerous cells like hundreds 
being done nationwide seeks to gather physical evidence of whether 
some people known as qigong masters can project their qi like a 
beam of energy to manipulate matter and cure illness 
gu one of 30 qigong researchers at the beijing college of 
traditional chinese medicine said some cancerous cells were killed 
in one sample in his experiment but not enough to prove anything 
qigong masters however say their work proves the mysterious 
force exists 
hu yulan 59 said she has cured serious heart and neurological 
illnesses by directing her qi at patients 
another master wan sujian said a 49yearold peasant woman came 
to him after a surgeon told her a large tumor in her brain was 
inoperable and that she would die in two months 
wan said the woman could barely walk because of the tumors 
pressure on portions of the brain that control movement 
but after 10 treatments he said the woman was walking freely 
the tumor has shrunk wan claimed he predicted complete 
recovery 
thousands of other qigong masters who operate clinics without 
licensing or regulation make similar claims some say they can heal 
bone fractures and diagnose ailments with xray vision even when 
the patient is absent volumes of anecdotes of seemingly miraculous 
cures have been published 
there are many blank areas in science said liu yaning a 
biophysicist at the air forces xidiaoyutai hospital in beijing 
in china many scientists believe the qigong masters will lead a 
revolution in science 
but western medicine which in the past decade has found chemical 
explanations for acupunctures ability to deaden pain balks at the 
concept of qi 
i havent been convinced by any experiment that this energy 
exists or that it can be controlled said dr david eisenberg an 
instructor at the harvard medical school who attended the qigong 
conference 
however eisenberg who studied traditional medicine in china in 
1979 and 1980 and wrote a book about qigong said he has seen 
startling demonstrations of qigong masters skills and cannot simply 
dismiss them as fakes 
there are phenomenon in every culture that suggests there may 
be the ability of humans to sense andor manipulate their own 
biological fields for lack of a better word he said im 
troubled but not convinced 
chinese scientists also are troubled many who are testing qigong 
masters said they believe some form of special human energy exists 
but cant define it 
books on qigong describe it variously as akin to radar infrared 
light magnetism subsonic sound waves or all of those 
i think qi is a big bag liu said there are a lot of 
things in it not just one kind of energy or matter 
he added that his experiments showing that natural luminescence 
given off by qigong masters bodies is higher than that given off by 
other people have convinced him qi exists 
there is much clinical evidence to see the effect of qigong on 
many different diseases said dr lu yongcai a pathologist at the 
beijing college of traditional medicines qigong institute we 
want to know the mechanisms that qi is present is no problem 
qi definitely can cause biological reactions thats a fact 
said zhou yang the institutes chief immunologist 
he said his experiments have shown that qi can promote the 
proliferation of diseasefighting tcells in laboratory mice and 
stimulate the development of the thymus an important gland in the 
immune system 
chinese scientists at the qigong conference said their work 
showed qigong masters can do such things as kill or inhibit leukemia 
cells in mice promote healing of strained muscles and broken bones 
in rabbits and sharpen intelligence 
eisenberg contended that most of the studies suffered from poor 
design or lacked control groups and other standard precautions 
against bias 
there is at least as much likelihood that this is a cultural 
societal wish fulfillment he said qi is part of the culture 
they are wed to it they want to prove it 
but dr gabriel stux who runs an acupuncture clinic in 
duesseldorf in west germany noted that western medicine also relies 
on techniques not fully understood 
many drugs you dont know how they work but you do a lot of 
pragmatic things he said

a man convicted of a felony for munching on 
grapes at a grocery store was ordered to pay 40 cents in restitution 
and 600 in court costs 
eli bradley jr 52 could have been imprisoned for up to four 
years on the charge of larceny from a building but jackson county 
circuit judge russell e noble on wednesday delayed the sentence and 
said he would consider removing the conviction from bradleys record 
if he stayed out of trouble until oct 4 1989 
im going to appeal this because im not guilty of no felony 
bradley said after the hearing any felony on your record works 
against you for the rest of your life if they can do what they did 
in this court nobody is safe in the courts 
bradley was arrested march 4 while leaving a grocery store 
security guards testified during his trial that they saw bradley 
eating several handfuls of grapes while shopping 
bradley testified that he ate no more than two or three grapes to 
be sure they were seedless before buying more than 1 pounds of 
grapes along with other groceries for 1325 
prosecutor joseph filip offered in june to reduce the charge to 
misdemeanor shoplifting defense lawyer richard l wilkins chose to 
go to trial on the felony charge which he considered easier to 
defend a jury convicted bradley in september 
this matter in my opinion could have been handled with much 
less expense as a misdemeanor not a felony the judge said 
wednesday 
assistant prosecutor donald ray said his office probably would 
oppose removal of the felony conviction next year even if bradley 
stayed out of trouble 
filip said the september verdict showed the community agrees that 
we dont want people stealing from stores 
in the republican prosecutors reelection campaign his 
democratic challenger paul r adams has chided him as having 
made the county safe for grapes

unlike the title character in his latest film 
madame sousatzka john schlesinger doesnt see himself as a 
teacher the director would rather have audiences make up their own 
minds 
i hope theres plenty of irony in all my films thats the very 
thing i look for said the british director of midnight 
cowboy marathon man and other acclaimed movies 
it could all be disaster but it isnt thats kind of my 
attitude to life most of the endings ive had there is a question 
mark theyre often about people determined to carry on 
madame sousatzka based on the novel by bernice rubens takes 
place in london and stars shirley maclaine as a demanding emotional 
piano teacher whose philosophy i teach how to live is the 
cause of much conflict with her students 
schlesinger originally sought a european actress to play the 
russianborn teacher but wanted maclaine after deciding to cast an 
american 
i liked the fact that she was willing to take risks he said 
i thought she brought quite a lot to terms of endearment 
looking dreadful shes not worried about her shirley maclaine 
image i got to know that very fast 
schlesinger credits maclaine whose work in terms of 
endearment earned her an academy award for best actress in 1985 
with making the eccentric sousatzka believeable 
sometimes when i worked on the script id say oh god shes 
too monstrous but she had a way of playing the eccentricities so 
that it was totally part of her the director said she doesnt 
play to the audience at all i think its a most extraordinary 
performance 
for the part of manek sen the 15yearold prodigy who endures 
sousatzskas violent mood swings schlesinger auditioned hundreds of 
actors before choosing newcomer navin chowdhry who makes his film 
debut in the movie chowdhry had no musical training but 
schlesinger nevertheless found him perfect for the part the 
youngster worked with musical advisor yonty solomon 
in a way irina sousatzka can be likened to nora desmond the 
aging actress in sunset boulevard both are flamboyant on the 
surface and lonely underneath desmond falls in love with a young 
screenwriter sousatskza with manek 
its a love story shes created something and now she falls in 
love with him schlesinger noted 
shes a survivor even if shes angry or upset i believe it 
isnt so removed from people even if the subject is about music 
its all about perfectly common human experience 
the 62yearold schlesingers own musical background attracted 
him to the story his father was a cellist his mother a violinist 
and schlesinger himself was an accomplished pianist as a child 
schlesinger was a character actor in the 1950s appearing on 
stage in television and films he also made documentary shorts his 
first commercial film terminus won the golden lion for best 
documentary at the 1961 venice film festival 
a kind of loving his first feature film was released the 
following year starring a then unknown alan bates the film won the 
golden bear award at the berlin film festival and established 
schlesinger as one of englands most talented young directors 
he then directed billy liar and darling which earned 
julie christie the best actress oscar in 1965 midnight cowboy 
his first film made in hollywood earned academy awards for best 
picture director and best adapted screenplay in 1969 
with jon voight as a texan hustler and dustin hoffman as a 
tubercular bronx con man midnight cowboy typified schlesingers 
fascination with characters who are up against it 
schlesinger sees that theme running strongly in madame 
sousatzka 
in the case of manek hes up against the promise of success 
and the possibility of failure which she has been up against he 
said shes up against her past shes up against it in many ways 
it makes her behave a certain way 
theyre all up against something changing london changing 
values 
schlesinger has also directed glenda jackson in sunday bloody 
sunday and hoffman and sir laurence olivier in marathon man 
enthusiasm the director says is what he looks for from his 
actors maclaine he said loved the role she didnt care 
about the money was charming to everyone particularly the boy the 
fact thats shes out banging the drum about the movie proves shes 
enthusiastic 
and so is schlesinger hes merged his great loves film and 
music and feels the movie expresses certain things he feels 
its communicating he said youre trying to invoke an 
emotional response to something to make them laugh or make them 
angry as well as just telling a story

alan garcia perus youthful president was 
viewed as latin americas brightest political star after taking 
office three years ago but today his nation is mired in its worst 
economic crisis of the century 
garcias reputation is in tatters and the countrys fragile 
democracy appears increasingly vulnerable to a military coup 
since garcia imposed the harshest austerity program in perus 
history in early september some critics have gone so far as to 
demand his resignation and he reportedly has considered stepping 
down more ominously many public figures are warning of the growing 
danger of a military takeover 
cesar hilderbrandt editor of the independent news magazine si 
wrote in a recently published open letter to garcia you know 
just as other officials of your government do that a coup detat is 
inevitable if the political and economic climate of today continues 
to devastate the country 
perus armed forces seized power in 1968 and ruled until 1980 
they returned to the barracks under heavy public accusations that 
their leftist policies brought on economic mismanagement 
the 39yearold garcias approval rating among perus 21 million 
people has plunged from an incredible 96 percent during his first 
months in office to 16 percent in late october according to the 
respected polling firm apoyo 
when he took over the 6foot3 garcia leader of the populist 
aprista party was called the president of hope by his 
followers most of them impoverished mountain peasants or 
inhabitants of limas sprawling shantytowns 
nowadays he is accused of being a demagogue of implementing 
impetuous irresponsible policies that have brought economic ruin to 
the nation and of failing to curtail the shining path movement 
whose eightyear guerrilla war has claimed more than 12000 lives 
mario vargas llosa the renowned novelist who is expected to be 
the presidential candidate of a centerright coalition in the 1990 
election recently described garcia as the charismatic young man 
responsible for perus most incompetent and ruinous government of 
the century 
what has peruvians most upset is the countrys unprecedented 
runaway inflation provoked economists agree by the governments 
uncontrolled spending which has spawned a huge fiscal deficit 
equivalent to 16 percent of the gross domestic product 
consumer prices soared by 114 percent in september as much in 
one month as all of last year inflation is expected to exceed 1000 
percent by year end 
having eaten up the countrys hard currency reserves to finance a 
consumerhinged economic recovery program and having cut itself off 
from fresh foreign loans the government is close to bankruptcy it 
has had to resort to selling the central banks gold bullion to pay 
import bills but now that is gone 
finance minister abel salinas said recently the economy would 
shrink by at least 6 percent this year after growing 85 percent in 
1986 and 70 percent in 1987 
the harsh austerity measures which included increases in food 
prices of more than 200 percent and a devaluation of nearly 90 
percent brought economic activity to a halt 
only four new cars were sold in the country in september because 
of tax increases that doubled car prices with the least expensive 
volkswagen model now costing 26000 beer sales were down 90 
percent from august 
from early september until mid october garcia did not leave the 
inner confines of the government palace for 34 straight days except 
on one occasion to watch the changing of the guards from the front 
entrance that single fleeting appearance was interpreted by 
commentators as a gesture to dispel rumors he was no longer in 
charge of the government 
garcia was reported to have tried to present his resignation to 
his cabinet before the unpopular austerity package was imposed and 
to have offered the job to luis alberto sanchez his 88yearold 
blind vice president sanchez said later that he told garcia i 
was elected vice president to collaborate with you not to take your 
place 
political analysts say garcias recent behavior has given the 
impression of a dangerous power vacuum that feeds the fears of a 
military takeover 
even the least informed citizen knows or senses that there 
cannot be a power vacuum in politics he also knows that in peru 
power vacuums are always filled by the military manuel 
dornellas editor of the opposition newspaper expreso wrote in a 
recent column 
a senior government official told the associated press that the 
military high command did in fact meet to consider overthrowing 
garcia during his selfimposed confinement to the palace 
the president was passing through a period of depression that 
worried the military the official said speaking on condition he 
not be identified 
having suffered in the past under long spells of military rule 
perus political leaders have been outspoken in demanding that the 
armed forces not be provoked into seizing power again 
nothing would be more tragic for peru than a military coup 
writer vargas llosa said perus isolation from the international 
community would be aggravated even further

urban school districts faced with tight budgets 
and serious teacher shortages are devising innovative local 
solutions such as grow your own programs to create more 
educators a private study shows 
the council of the great city schools in a report released 
tuesday said big cities are especially short of minority teachers 
and instructors in specialized areas for the 45 districts included 
in the study 70 percent of students were minorities compared with 
32 percent of the teaching force 
the sad truth is that most new teachers would rather teach 
anywhere other than a large city the study said black teacher 
education students possess no more inclination to teach in large 
cities than white candidates 
the study teaching and leading in the great city schools 
said teacher shortages are four times higher in urban areas than 
elsewhere in the country and could quadruple by 1992 in the biggest 
cities 
yet the council a coalition of 45 of the largest urban school 
districts in the country chose to highlight how cities are meeting 
the challenge rather than dwelling on the problems they face 
we want to make clear that although the needs of urban areas 
are critical the situation is not without hope said the report 
we are moving ahead with or without the additional funding

top energy department officials will meet with 
the governors of colorado idaho and new mexico this month to 
discuss ways of disposing of radioactive wastes from weapons 
facilities 
waste disposal is one of many problems that have beset the 
departments nuclear weapons complex forcing four facilities to 
partially close and virtually halting the production of atomic arms 
idaho governor cecil andrus took credit tuesday for forcing the 
issue by blocking his states borders last month to a rail car 
loaded with radioactive wastes 
andrus said tuesday that because he turned up the heat his 
state was no longer being asked to shoulder the burden and that he 
would ask federal officials for concrete evidence they are moving 
forward on ways to solve the disposal problem 
now we are getting support from sources that might have been 
content to sit back in the past and let idaho take the heat 
andrus told reporters in boise 
energy secretary john s herrington asked the three governors to 
meet in salt lake city on nov 16 with a team headed by his chief 
deputy joseph salgado to discuss how to dispose of defense wastes 
until the department can open its planned waste isolation pilot 
plant near carlsbad nm 
andrus and govs roy romer of colorado and garrey carruthers of 
new mexico said they would attend but that the date might shift 
its important to new mexico to get this thing resolved 
carruthers said through spokesman don caviness 
romer said through his press secretary cindy parmenter that he 
would take part but described the nov 16 date as tentative 
the situation became critical last month when andrus turned away 
a steellined boxcar loaded with lowlevel radioactive waste he 
declared the idaho national engineering laboratory offlimits for 
further waste storage and said that if energy department officials 
cant handle the waste they shouldnt be generating it 
the rail car loaded with 140 drums each containing 55 gallons of 
waste ended up at a siding at the departments rocky flats plant 
near denver 
the colorado governor allowed the boxcar to park at rocky flats 
but asked department officials not to unload it and turned down 
their request to expand waste storage facilities there 
the government had planned to open the new mexico facility last 
month but was delayed because congress failed to pass legislation 
to transfer the land from the bureau of land management to the 
energy department 
lowlevel radioactive material would be buried 2000 feet 
underground in salt deposits at the new mexico site 
rocky flats the argonne national laboratory near chicago and 
the lawrence livermore laboratory in livermore calif have been 
shipping radioactive rags machines parts gloves liquids and other 
debris to the idaho site where an estimated 2 million cubic feet of 
the waste is stored below ground and 24 million cubic feet is 
stored above ground in steel barrels

us savings bonds will earn interest at a rate 
of 735 percent over the next six months the government has 
announced 
the new rate which took effect tuesday is up from a rate of 
690 percent that was effective from may 1 to nov 1 
jerrold b speers executive director of the savings bond 
program called the new rate highly competitive with other savings

interest on savings bonds is adjusted twice a year on may 1 and 
nov 1 to reflect open market interest rates the rate is based on 
85 percent of the yield on fiveyear treasury securities which have 
averaged 865 percent over the past six months 
the total value of bonds held by the public now exceeds 107 
billion

nigerias surging birth rate will triple 
its population by 2025 making it the worlds fourth most populous 
country after china india and the soviet union a new un study 
predicts 
the un world population chart 1988 predicts that 25 years 
into the third millennium nigeria will have 3013 million people 
surpassing the united states 3007 million 
the westcentral african nation was the worlds 10th most 
populous in 1985 with 951 million people 
undersecretarygeneral rafeeuddin ahmad introducing the study at 
a news conference tuesday said africas population is growing 
faster than that of any other continent 
the populations of asia and latin america are growing more 
moderately than africas and of course in many countries in europe 
the population growth is almost stationary 
each woman in the world has on the average 34 children that 
is the total fertility rate the number for africa is 62 and it is 
around 35 in latin america and asia he said 
kenya and rwanda have fertility rates of more than eight children 
per woman according to the chart 
in contrast women in europe and north america have 17 to 18 
children a number not sufficient to replace the existing population 
in the long run ahmad said 
he said africas high birth rate offsets a life expectancy of 
only 52 years compared with an average of 60 for developing 
countries as a whole and 73 for industrialized nations 
aging is bound to become a very important issue in governments 
both in the developed and developing countries in coming years 
said ahmad 
by the year 2025 china will have an estimated 149 billion 
people and india 144 billion the soviet union is expected to have 
3514 million 
the 6th through 10th most populous nations in 2025 are expected 
to be pakistan with 267 million indonesia 2577 million brazil 
2458 million bangladesh 234 9 million and mexico with 150 
million people 
currently west germany italy britain france and spain rank 
in the 25 most populous countries by 2025 france is expected to be 
the only west european nation in the top 25 holding the 24th rank 
with 604 million people 
the worlds population was 51 billion in mid1988 and will reach 
6 billion in 1998 by 2025 it is expected to hit 846 billion 
population has been growing at a rate of about 17 percent since 
the mid1970s a rate that will remain steady until the mid1990s 
then steadily decline to below 1 percent by 2025 said ahmad 
the population division of the un department of international 
economic and social affairs prepared the data for the chart

michael dukakis amp co should have seen it 
coming 
a campaign with a clear game plan could have dealt in advance 
with the troublesome liberal label it first shunned and now has 
claimed as its own it might have defined the label in its own way 
instead of leaving the republicans leeway to write the campaign 
definition 
political labeling often has become a problem for presidential 
candidates in both parties the tag that has hurt most reads 
liberal those who could fought back by enforcing the right to 
tell voters what the term meant 
and if that bit of history werent warning enough george bush 
had told the democrats he was coming at them on ideology 
dukakis late conversion is risky the safer time to define a 
candidate and his philosophy is by midsummer not midautumn nine 
days before the voters choose a president 
the massachusetts governor had tried to position himself as a 
candidate for whom ideology wouldnt count his organization saw to 
it that the democrats adopted a brief vague party platform in 
marked contrast to the booklength catalogue of promises the party 
had issued four years earlier 
bush insisted that ideology was an issue and when the democrats 
left him the opening he proceeded to define the word liberal to 
mean someone who is soft on crime soft on national defense likely 
to spend too much money and therefore force higher taxes he then 
proceeded to attach the word to dukakis 
an nbc newswall street journal poll reflects the impact four 
surveys the latest in midoctober show a steady progression in the 
number of likely voters who consider dukakis too liberal to be a 
good president to 37 percent up 11 points from midsummer 
after weeks of resisting the liberal description and after 
complaining about bushs use of the tab in nationally televised 
debate dukakis shifted on sunday and proclaimed that he is indeed a 
liberal in the tradition of franklin roosevelt and harry truman 
and john kennedy 
he said that means working for the average american helping 
those who need help and at the same time paying the governments 
bills his problem is that bush has had most of the campaign to 
hammer at his definition of the term insisting that it puts dukakis 
out of the american mainstream 
this election isnt about ideology dukakis told the 
democratic national convention in accepting his nomination on july 
21 its about competence 
that statement is more often quoted than the telling 
counterpointing bush supplied in his own acceptance speech 
competence is a narrow ideal the vice president said 
competence makes the trains run on time but doesnt know where 
theyre going competence is the creed of the technocrat 
the truth is this election is about the beliefs we share the 
values we honor the principles we hold dear 
bush was trailing in the public opinion polls at that point by 
margins similar to those that now read in his favor 
the rhetoric of august foretold a big part of the campaign 
strategy that has reversed the odds bush tells his campaign rallies 
that beliefs and values are behind his differences with dukakis on 
such matters as prison furloughs and a requirement that teachers 
lead pupils in reciting the pledge of allegiance 
the liberal governor of massachusetts bush says over and 
over again disagrees with him 
the fiercest battles over political labeling often have come 
during struggles for presidential nomination not afterward 
bush says dukakis claimed liberal credentials when he needed them 
to win democratic primaries on his way to the nomination and then 
tried to move to the middle that kind of positioning isnt unusual 
it is done in both political parties 
indeed over the course of his career bush has done some of it 
himself when he ran for the gop nomination in 1980 he was cast as 
a moderate republican against the conservative who won ronald 
reagan when he lost a senate seat 10 years earlier in texas it was 
as a relatively liberal republican beaten by a democrat who 
outflanked him on the right on some issues the democrat was lloyd 
bentsen 
and when reagan turned to bush for the vice presidential 
nomination in 1980 a good many gop conservatives were outraged 
they knew bush by his resume and by his reputation if hed run 
against reagan he must be out of the partys liberal wing 
he wasnt but to victorious conservatives the ones who later 
complained that reagan was acting pragmatically any moderate was 
suspect 
the republican labeling war was fiercest in 1964 with former 
sen barry goldwater conservative in one corner and the late 
nelson a rockefeller liberal in the other liberal wasnt a 
popular word in gop circles then or now so rockefeller defined 
himself as a mainstream republican 
goldwaters conservatives won the battle and lost the war to 
lyndon b johnsons democratic landslide from that day liberal 
republicans chose to designate themselves as moderates 
while dukakis likened his liberalism to men like roosevelt 
truman and kennedy he sidestepped when asked if he also was in the 
liberal tradition of such democrats as george mcgovern and walter 
mondale both liberals both big losers 
maybe he should have tried the formula described by george 
romney an early loser in the contest for the 1968 gop nomination 
im as conservative as the constitution as liberal as lincoln 
and as progressive as theodore roosevelt he said

democrat michael dukakis is running television 
ads that tout his home ownership plan and trash his rivals trade 
record but only for the benefit of viewers in the key electoral 
state of ohio 
the ohio campaign aimed at stretched working families is one of 
several specialized televisin and radio appeals mounted by dukakis 
and republican george bush in states critical to their presidential 
ambitions 
the crossfire has been particularly heavy in california texas 
and ohio and in states with large hispanic voter populations a 
blitz of statespecific advertising is expected in the few days 
before the election with new york new jersey illinois and 
pennsylvania among the candidates for a final fusillade 
one of the premier battlegrounds is california with 47 electoral 
votes and an electorate deeply concerned about the environment bush 
jumped on that concern early trying to alarm voters with the 
specter of bostons polluted harbor 
michael dukakis says he wants to protect our environment but 
the epa called boston harbor the dirtiest waterway in america 
says an ad for the vice president and now michael dukakis says 
he wants to do for america what hes done for massachusetts 
california cant take that risk variations on the spot are also 
running in new jersey and washington 
dukakis the massachusetts governor is countercharging in 
california that bushs administration cut funds to clean up the 
states coast from san francisco to southern california in one ad 
from san diego harbor to san francisco bay in another 
the ads say bush opposed a crackdown on polluter corporations 
twice supported a veto of the clean water act and end by saying 
thats why the nonpartisan league of conservation voters has 
endorsed michael dukakis 
california democrats have been among the most active in the 
nation in creating their own ads the state party is running two 
votedemocratic ads hitting the gop record on education and the 
environment as well as three dukakis is on your side spots 
taped last week at a raucous dukakis rally in los angeles 
i want an america thats in charge of its own future the 
candidate says in one of the rally ads were going to have clean 
air and clean water and clean coasts and a clean government in 
washington dc 
texas with 29 electoral votes is another state under media 
siege dukakis trotted out his running mate popular texas sen 
lloyd bentsen in an early spot stressing bentsens lead role in 
passing plantclosing legislation and again more recently in an ad 
called partnership 
ive been fighting to build a future for texas and the nation 
i now have a strong partner in that fight and hes mike dukakis 
says bentsen i know him and you know me were going to put 
america first 
in the latest ad featuring bentsen the democratic candidate 
accuses the republicans of running a negative campaign and warns 
voters that the gop is trying to scare you with some phony 
issues 
another dukakis ad accused bush of failing to help texas when it 
was in the throes of the oilbusiness collapse 
when a quarter of a million texas jobs were lost where was 
george the ad asks when 192 texas banks closed and 23000 
texas businesses failed where was george 
for his part bush called on retired us air force gen chuck 
yeager to instill fears about the safety of the states 300000 
defenserelated jobs should dukakis be elected yeager the first 
man to break the sound barrier says in the ad that liberal 
democrats advocating defense cuts would put those jobs at risk 
dukakis also ran two texas commercials to counter a bush tv 
attack on his furlough program and a national rifle association 
radio assault on his gun control stands one dukakis spot says bush 
voted for gun control while in congress and dukakis supports gun 
ownership by hunters and sportsmen the other says dukakis took 
action and changed the furlough program and reduced crime by 13 
percent in his state 
the economic populist pitch dukakis has adopted in the final days 
of his campaign emerged two weeks ago in ohio which has 23 
electoral votes in ads tailored to appeal to working families 
insecure about their economic futures 
michael dukakis stands up for working families how home 
start a program to give families a chance to buy their first 
home an announcer declares in one ohio spot as images of 
construction sites treelined streets and the massachusetts 
governor roll by no new bureaucracies no red tape for 
americas working families michael dukakis for president 
another ohio spot shows viewers the japanese flag and says bush 
returned from japan saying our trade relationship was superb 
superb for japan maybe superb for japanese workers but bad news 
for american working families the american flag waves as the 
announcer concludes michael dukakis stands up to foreign 
competition keep american jobs in america michael dukakis for 
president 
both candidates are seeking hispanic votes via tv and radio 
stations in states with large hispanic populations texas foremost 
among them bush is using an ad featuring his mexican 
daughterinlaw columba and his three hispanic grandchildren the 
ad in both english and spanish versions currently is airing in 
texas and new york 
dukakis is running tv spots on education crime control and his 
immigrant heritage on two national hispanic networks univision and 
telemundo the commercials end with the spanishspeaking governor 
addressing viewers and a tagline that says he speaks our

montanan john melcher is using pastoral 
politics in his fight to retain his us senate seat and prevent 
conrad burns from becoming the states first republican senator 
since 1952 
every election some greenhorn runs against doc melcher says 
a talking cow in one melcher campaign ad they come in thinking 
they can put doc out to pasture 
but they leave with egg on their faces and even worse on their 
shoes chuckles another cudchewing bovine 
melcher a veterinarian and twoterm senator holds a 
doubledigit lead over burns in recent state polls but the 
republican county commissioner from billings is waging a spirited 
challenge 
i just think john melcher is completely out of step with the 
majority of montanans says burns who has been hammering away at 
his opponent as too liberal and an ineffective member of the 
senate 
the liberal accusation is nothing new for melcher who was 
targeted for defeat by the national conservative political action 
committee in 1982 
he responded with tv ads that featured talking cows ridiculing 
ncpac as a herd of cityslickers trying to fool montanans about 
old doc melcher 
earlier this year burns picked up on the theme warning voters 
that doc melchers cows would be spreading real bull this 
election in response the incumbent senator again trotted out his 
campaign cows 
melcher 64 a senior member of the senate agriculture committee 
portrays himself as a fighter who stands up for family farmers 
workers and montanas basic industries timber mining and 
agriculture 
in 1985 he fought reagan administration attempts to reduce price 
supports for grain cotton and rice 
if what i get done is beneficial then thats how i should be 
judged he says there are very few people in congress who 
understand what the west is all about 
melcher is also considered something of a maverick he was one of 
only two senators who voted against the omnibus drug bill of 1986 
one of only three who opposed the 1986 tax overhaul bill and one of 
only three who voted against the uscanadian trade agreement this 
year 
melcher received high ratings from many liberal groups but he 
has voted with conservatives on several key issues 
he opposed the panama canal treaty in 1978 supported reagans 
1981 tax cuts and the balancedbudget law and is a staunch opponent 
of abortion 
burns 53 operated a farmandranch broadcasting service until 
he ran for commissioner in montanas largest county in 1986 he 
upset the democratic incumbent and announced earlier this year he 
would take on melcher 
theres quite a bit of dissatisfaction here in the state of 
montana he says i dont think we can stand six more years of 
the same 
folksy personable campaigner burns has been barnstorming the 
state meeting voters doortodoor he says his outgoing friendly 
style will be more effective in the senate than melchers 
obstructionist tactics 
but burns media campaign carries a strident tone labeling 
melcher as soft on drugs crime and defense and describing him as 
a bigspending liberal who likes to raise taxes 
some of burns advertising was prepared with help from the 
republican senatorial campaign committee which helped recruit him 
as a candidate and considers him one of the gops best shots at 
knocking off an incumbent senate democrat in 1988 
burns montana managers have denied suggestions that the national 
committee is calling the shots for the campaign but say the 
assistance is welcome and needed to offset melchers 2to1 
advantage in campaign funds 
despite polls showing him behind burns is convinced he has a 
chance he says his agricultural background will help him cut into 
melchers power base in eastern montana which melcher represented 
in congress for 7 years 
i think its going to be tighter than a new pair of shoes 
burns says of the election

the reagan administration is again in court 
defending its refusal to do anything about acid rain in canada 
while at the same time it has signed a new international accord 
limiting one of acid rains main constituents 
the environmental protection agency said the accord signed 
tuesday in sofia bulgaria by agency administrator lee m thomas 
means no additional regulatory actions are required by the 
united states against oxides of nitrogen 
these combustion products become acid rain in the atmosphere and 
help form urban smog one of them is responsible for the color of 
the brown cloud that hangs over smoggy cities such as los 
angeles 
lawsuits were filed tuesday in the us circuit court of appeals 
for the district of columbia seeking to force the epa to require 
states to revise their air pollution control plans to eliminate 
damage to canada 
this is the same question that the plaintiffs the canadian 
province of ontario the izaak walton league and the sierra club 
legal defense foundation lost in a previous court round 
though the epa under the carter administration had declared that 
acid rain originating in the united states was harming canada the 
court ruled that such a declaration was not enough to force the 
states to act formal epa regulations are required the court said 
the epa has argued that not enough is known about acid rain to 
draw up a control program 
we cannot afford to hold our breath waiting for the us 
environmental protection agency to wake up and smell the sulfur 
ontario environment minister jim bradley told the provincial 
legislature in announcing the new lawsuit 
the major component of acid rain in the eastern united states and 
canada is sulfuric acid formed from sulfur dioxide emitted by 
utility and factory boilers 
the new york state attorney generals office said it was 
preparing a renewal of a related suit on behalf of new york new 
jersey minnesota and the six new england states 
in bulgaria the united states joined a nitrogen oxides annex to 
the united nationssponsored treaty on longrange transboundary air 
pollution 
in negotiation the united states sought a 20 percent credit 
against emissions limits to compensate for reductions in us 
emissions that had not yet been matched by european countries 
in a compromise the negotiators chose a pick your limit 
requirement emissions in any year through 1987 the particular year 
chosen by each signing country will be the limit in the 1990s in 
addition the annual average for the period 19871996 may not exceed 
1987 emissions 
for the united states this amounts to about a 5 percent credit 
nitrogen oxides peaked in 1978 at 224 million tons and are now 
about 203 million tons fortyfour percent comes from 
transportation mostly motor vehicles and a little under half from 
boilers 
though new cars emit only a quarter of the nitrogen oxides that 
they did in the 1960s travel has grown so much that total emissions 
are declining only slowly and epa expects the total to turn up 
again in about 1995 reaching 202 million tons in 2000 
the united states refused to sign an earlier sulfur dioxide 
agreement pledging 30 percent emissions reductions it said that 
would be unfair since us emissions have fallen by a much larger 
amount than those in european countries

about 2 billion 
thats substantial but its down significantly from losses of 
36 billion in the previous quarter and 39 billion in the first 
three months of this year 
sampls hard hit in depressed oil regions of the southwest are 
suffering their worst year since the depression the industry last 
earned a small profit in the first three months of 1987 
barth speaking at the us league of savings institutions annual 
convention attributed shrinking losses to regulators steppedup 
pace of sampl rescues and closings totaling 137 so far this year 
losses rather than being reported on the books of the 
institutions are being transferred to the books of the deposit 
insurance fund he said 
also because most of the rescue packages guarantee restructured 
institutions against future loss as well as taking away past loss 
there is no way of telling from industry numbers if losses in those 
institutions are continuing 
r dan brumbaugh a private analyst and former bank board 
economist said the new loss number does not necessarily indicate 
the cost of cleaning up the sampl mess estimated by regulators at 45 
billion to 50 billion is getting better 
i would say the problem continues to grow he said 
moreover he said thrift institutions as well as commercial 
banks are more vulnerable now to an economic downturn than at any 
time in 50 years 
we have fragile institutions that could get significantly 
worse even in a mild recession brumbaugh said 
jerry l jordan chief economist of first interstate bancorp in 
los angeles said thrifts next year likely also face a onehalf 
percentage point increase in longterm interest rates and a full 
point increase in shortterm rates 
higher rates make it more expensive for thrift institutions to 
acquire funds for lending 
thrift institutions in the past have struggled to remain 
profitable during periods of rising rates but james w christian 
chief economist of the us league said currently solvent 
institutions would remain stable because rates on about a third of 
the loans they hold fluctuate with the market 
however barth warned that insolvent institutions in texas where 
much of the industrys losses are concentrated would be twice as 
endangered by higher interest rates as solvent sampls

turkeys civilian government has as bad a human 
rights record as its military predecessor torturing parents in 
front of their children as part of a widespread campaign against 
political opponents amnesty international said today 
the londonbased human rights organization said in a report that 
torture continued against suspected opponents despite the 
governments signing in august of the un convention against 
torture 
amnesty said it has reports that five turkish prisoners 
including a 13yearold diabetic boy died after torture in the 
first half of 1988 
the victims amnesty said were among more than 250000 turks 
arrested for political reasons since 1980 several thousand 
political prisoners were still held it added 
amnesty said it has received more than 20 reports of prisoners 
being tortured since turkey ratified the un convention 
torture continues despite turkey having signed and ratified 
the united nations convention the report said 
torture is widespread anyone arrested for political reasons is 
at grave risk young men and women are tortured in front of each 
other parents are tortured in front of their children women held 
hostage for their husbands are tortured 
the report said torture methods include electric shocks 
kickings beating on the soles of the feet sexual assault 
suspension by wrists or ankles and deprivation of food drink and 
sleep 
amnesty spokeswoman daphne davies said copies of the report were 
being sent to tour operators offering vacations in turkey to give 
them a full picture 
the report said that under the elected government that took over 
in 1983 political prisoners were still being tried by military 
courts it said state security courts intended to replace military 
justice did not conduct fair trials the preceding military regime 
had seized power in a 1980 coup 
of the political prisoners amnesty said some were convicted 
for no more than expressing their opinions many others because they 
confessed to crimes of which they were innocent to escape the agony 
of torture 
most of these prisoners did not receive a fair trial some were 
sentenced to death today almost 200 people await a decision on 
whether they will go to the gallows the report added 
among individual cases amnesty said ibrahim cicek a member of 
the banned revolutionary peoples union said in a letter from 
prison that he and two friends were doused with water and made to 
hold hands at an istanbul police station in october 1987 then an 
electric current was turned on passing through each of them and 
resulting in what he described as a choir of screams 
the report said the diabetic teenager emin ozkaya died in 
hospital in january after detention at a police station in finike 
in southwest turkey 
immediately after the military coup violence between rival 
political groups decreased but human rights abuses worsened the 
report said 
tens of thousands of men and women were taken into custody 
more than 30000 were jailed in the first four months after the

lowincome recipients of government benefits 
often are victims of a catch22 because they cant afford bank 
accounts they must pay high checkcashing fees even though the 
checks are backed by uncle sam says a new study 
the study by the general accounting office says it might be 
better if the money were made available to the recipients through 
electronic transfer rather than by paper checks 
some consumer groups have advocated that banking institutions be 
forced to cash government checks from noncustomers but the gao 
study released tuesday suggests other ways 
use of electronic funds transfer technology for example has 
been cited as a way to solve checkcashing problems by bringing more 
government check recipients into the banking system the study 
said 
its use could also lower government costs and reduce banking 
institution concerns about check forgeries and long lines in their 
lobbies current technology can also make benefits available through 
use of plastic cards at automatic teller machines and pointof sale 
outlets 
the agency also suggested congress require government departments 
to work out a governmentwide way of better delivery of benefits to 
recipients as well as saving money 
the gao said 17 percent of the 929 million families in the 
united states did not have banking accounts in 1985 and 56 percent 
of those had incomes below 10000 a year to cash social security 
or other checks these people often turn to 3000 mostly unregulated 
outlets which charge checkcashing fees 
the gao believes that maintaining a lowcost banking account is 
less expensive than using many checkcashing centers while such an 
account would cost up to 4 or more a month the gao said 
checkcashing centers usually charge more 
for example the consumer federation of america found that on 
average check cashers charged 847 to cash one 500 government 
check the study said even in new york new jersey and 
illinois where checkcashing center fees are regulated cashing one 
500 government check costs between 385 and 750 
requirements that banks cash government checks for noncustomers 
and provide lowcost checking accounts for poor people was part of a 
proposed restructuring of the nations financial system that died in 
congress last month the restructuring foundered because of a 
jurisdictional dispute between two house committees 
the gao says no definitive information exists on why some 
families dont have bank accounts but that the reasons include 
costs including minimum balance requirements asset limits in 
welfare rules mistrust of banking institutions lack of 
mathematical and reading skills inconvenient bank hours and 
accountopening requirements that require identification with a 
major credit card 
as for banks they said they should not be required to cash 
checks for noncustomers because of costs including providing extra 
tellers on certain days and the presence of large numbers of 
individuals in banking institution lobbies the few days a month when 
government checks are received

higher prices point to another increase in the 
value of us agricultural exports in the 1989 fiscal year that 
began oct 1 but an agriculture department analysis says the actual 
volume of shipments is expected to decline 
exports of feed grains corn sorghum oats and barley could 
decline by a much as onetenth during the fiscal year the report 
said wheat shipments are more uncertain 
overall value of farm exports in the 1988 fiscal year that ended 
sept 30 has been estimated by usda at 34 billion up from 279 
billion the year before the volume is estimated at 146 million 
metric tons up from 1292 million tons the previous year 
the volume of us wheat exports in 1989 is expected to fall 
at least through may the report said 
looking at corn and the other coarse grains the departments 
economic research service said that substantial us corn stocks 
and expanding import demand probably will hold the fiscal 1989 
decline in coarse grain export volume to around 10 percent higher 
prices however will more than offset the decline in volume 
meaning a greater export value 
for soybeans higher market prices may about match decreases in 
volume in 1989 resulting in little change in value from 1988 
the report said 
the report did not include a forecast of 1989 export values and 
volume those are scheduled for release by the agency on nov 29 
including preliminary figures for 1988 
but the analysis written by economist stephen macdonald said 
the 1989 export volume may decline because the drought has raised 
prices by reducing supplies of grains and oilseeds however export 
value may rise as higher prices and continued strong exports of 
highvalue products offset lower volume 
the report added that healthy economic growth overseas will 
help keep exports of highvalue products such as meat fruits and 
vegetables at current levels 
in the past two years us agricultural exports have grown 
roughly 30 percent in value and volume the report said the 
us share of world agricultural trade value has rebounded from 
1986s 12 percent the lowest in over 25 years towards its 
longterm average of 16 percent higher prices for grains oilseeds 
and other bulk products have been partly responsible 
the report said that most of the rebound came from a greater 
volume of exports 
a drop in support prices the lower valued dollar and 
increased use of the export enhancement program subsidies raised 
the us share of trade in bulk agricultural products from 35 
percent in the 198586 crop year to 45 percent in 198788 the 
report said during 198889 the us share probably will fall 
somewhat but it should remain above 198586

this years drought is expected to reduce 1988 
production of dry beans by 25 percent to the lowest level in five 
years says an agriculture department report 
also the drought had a substantial impact on the output of 
snap beans sweet corn and green peas for processing as crops 
withered in wisconsin minnesota michigan and illinois 
the report issued tuesday was a brief summary of a forthcoming 
larger review other highlights of the us vegetable situation this 
season and in 1987 included 
potato production will decline this year despite good crops of 
winter and spring varieties summer and fall crops were hurt 
severely by the drought in 1987 by contrast record high yields 
and larger acreage pushed the total potato harvest up 7 percent to 
385 million hundredweight 
per capita use of all commercially produced vegetables dropped 
14 pounds to an average of 325 pounds in 1987 with consumption of 
fresh vegetables and potatoes declining for the first time since 
1981 
lettuce and tomatoes which account for 45 percent of fresh 
vegetable use each declined in use last year caused partly by 
diseasereduced yields in calfornia lettuce and poor tomato yields 
in many minor producing states 
vegetable imports grew 9 percent in 1987 to 49 billion pounds 
with 86 percent of the increase in fresh vegetables and potatoes 
the value of production for the 10 major fresh vegetables rose 7 
percent in 1987 due mainly to higher prices for lettuce onions and 
tomatoes the nine major processing vegetables increased 1 percent 
in value mostly because of higher prices for snap beans sweet corn 
and asparagus

construction workers who camp out in parks are 
eying a plot of prime excess government land near the pentagon 
that is technically eligible for consideration as a site to shelter 
the homeless 
the northern virginia union for the homeless which represents 
the homeless construction workers and their families wants to use 
the land as a campsite and eventually would like to acquire it to 
build lowincome housing 
the situation has sent federal officials on a frantic search for 
surplus government land that would be a suitable alternative to the 
site near the pentagon 
the 142 acres of land that is estimated to be worth millions of 
dollars contains grassy areas and parking for 1000 cars the parcel 
was identified by the homeless group as the only plot of excess 
federal land in the washington area 
the general services administration says the property is slated 
to be used for possible expansion of the pentagon and wont be 
considered as a site to build lowincome housing 
the dispute pits the reagan administration against a group of 
workers who migrated to washington from economically depressed 
places such as west virginia and oklahoma to find work in the areas 
booming construction market 
unable to afford hojudge ruled 
sept 30 that property classified as excess must be considered 
as possible sites to shelter the homeless under homeless legislation 
passed last year by congress 
us district judge oliver gasch ordered gsa to identify all 
underutilized government property that could be converted into 
shelters for the homeless he ruled that excess property fell 
into that category as well 
gsa spokesman dale bruce conceded that the pentagon site falls 
into the category described in the judges order 
the only point we can make on that is this is a very unique 
situation there are no other properties we are aware of across the 
country that fall into this category it really shouldnt be on 
there 
the land was first listed in excess in 1966 by the federal 
highway administration following completion of interstate road 
construction since then the navy has leased the property to 
provide parking for employees at an office building near the 
pentagon bruce said 
the site has been on the list ever since even though gsa was 
supposed to canvass other government agencies to find another use or 
decide it should be declared surplus property 
each year it has been repermitted over to the navy bruce 
said the land is now part of the pentagons master plan for use as 
the site for more defense department offices he said 
this is simply on that list out of a technicality we are 
trying to do everything possible to identify optional sites for the 
homeless which would hopefully serve the same purpose in the 
northern virginia area bruce said 
ms aikens said government officials have appeared nervous at two 
negotiating sessions 
given the fact that the property has been in excess for 22 
years and nobody seems set to use it she said they are pretty 
afraid of what a court might say if a question were put in front of 
a judge

in picking people to run the new presidents 
administration transition aides can lean on suggestions in the 
prune book a compilation of the 100 toughest jobs in washington 
the book includes anecdotes from people who have held the 
powerful policy and management positions in the various agencies and 
lists the qualifications deemed necessary for the jobs 
these jobs are the mount everest of anyones career said 
frank weil a former assistant secretary of commerce who worked with 
the center for excellence in government to produce the book 
here are some things transition teams should look at according 
to those who have held the positions 
the assistant secretary of state for african affairs needs 
stamina he spends about 25 percent of his time on the road and has 
a grueling social schedule wining and dining african officials 
the undersecretary of state for management needs a thick skin 
this is a job where you do not make anybody happy said ronald 
spiers who has held the post since 1983 
the assistant secretary of agriculture for marketing and 
inspection services should like reading government rules and 
learning spanish is a good idea he deals regularly with people from 
central america 
the cias general counsel should be a smart savvy lawyer 
whos been around one former occupant said 
the book released to coincide with the transition to a new 
administration was written by john trattner a former state 
department spokesman in the carter administration 
the center which sponsored the project recruited teams of 
former government officials who culled the lists of political 
positions to select the toughest 100 jobs all the positions require 
senate confirmation 
the books title is a play on words on the governments plum 
book which lists political jobs at the start of every new 
administration a prune is an older wiser plum weil said 
the next president could have as many as 6000 jobs to fill in a 
federal civilian bureaucracy that totals about 21 million 
trattner said the next president could jeopardize his 
administration by selecting the wrong people for the 100 toughest 
jobs 
the people in this small group are the critical actors in the 
life of any administration he said 
while government pay is not as high as that in the private 
sector many of the jobs are similar to those held by chief 
executive officers of large corporations 
trattner said two of the most important positions in the 1990s 
will be the administrator of the environmental protection agency and 
the undersecretary of defense for acquisition the person in charge 
of procurement both jobs involve complicated issues and intersect 
with private industry and capitol hill he said 
since the top pay is no higher that 89900 many people must 
take a cut in salary to enter government 
but that doesnt seem to deter applicants some of whom see 
government service as a star on their resume weil said 
officials at the center also said they dont think strict 
postemployment ethics guidelines will dampen enthusiasm for 
government service 
few people have any problems on the other side of the revolving 
door he said

new york state and the long island county of 
suffolk are appealing a nuclear regulatory commission staff 
recommendation that the shoreham nuclear plant be allowed to operate 
at 25 percent of capacity a lawyer says 
lawrence lanpher an attorney representing the county said 
tuesday that the appeal argues shoreham should not be permitted to 
operate at any power level greater than 5 percent 
the 54 billion nuclear reactor was completed in 1984 but never 
opened 
on monday the nrc staff submitted a report recommending that the 
commissions director of nuclear reactor regulation be authorized 
to issue a 25 percent of rated power license for shoreham 
the staff based its conclusion on a safety evaluation report 
also written by nrc staff which found that the risk and 
consequences of accidents are greatly reduced at 25 percent power as 
compared to fullpower operation 
the license recommendation now goes to a threejudge panel of the 
atomic safety and licensing board an arm of the nrc if the board 
reaches the same conclusion as the staff the matter still must be 
approved by the full commission before a 25 percent power license 
can be granted 
nrc spokesman john kopeck said there was no timetable for the 
matter to be resolved 
the reactor has had a 5 percent testing license since 1985 
fullpower licensing became stalled over the refusal by state and 
local governments to participate in emergency planning they contend 
the area around shoreham could not be safely evacuated 
lanpher said the staff report failed to quantify the reduction in 
risk at 25 percent of power as compared to full power 
in fact they talked in that report about how dangerous 
radiation could still spread out to 10 miles and beyond if there 
were an accident he said so we think this confirms the fact 
that the long island lighting co cannot be authorized to operate 
at 25 percent power in advance of having an approved emergency 
plan 
but jim lois a long island lighting spokesman said the utility 
was pleased by the finding 
this supports our belief that the plant can operate safely as 
we continue to find ways to bring muchneeded energy to long 
island he said

students at east rome high school cant find 
books on witchcraft on shelves at their school library and they 
must have parental permission to take out other controversial 
books school officials said 
the policy which was adopted a few years ago by the schools 
media committee does not apply to any other high school in the city 
or floyd county and two members of the school board want it 
reviewed the media committee is made up of the principal librarian 
and some teachers parents and students 
one school board member said the east rome policy amounts to 
unnecessary censorship 
what we are doing is preventing certain books from hitting the 
eyes of certain students said sandra jones i just think its 
so dangerous its horrifying 
ms jones said her 17yearold son a student at east rome high 
had received her permission last year when he sought to check out a 
book on witchcraft from the school library 
a guidance counselor contacted her anyway saying school 
officials decided not to allow her son to check out the book 
they took the book off the shelf and would not let him check it 
out ms jones said how better can we get kids focusing in on 
witchcraft and satanism than to tell them they cant read about it 
certain other books such as the color purple by alice 
walker which includes descriptions of incest and lesbianism may 
be taken out only with parental consent 
ms jones said she feels her son should be allowed to read the 
books he chooses 
let him read a book praise god he wants to read a book she 
said i had no problem with my son checking out the book 
east rome librarian vivian strain explained that the school does 
have provisions for some controversial books but there are some 
books we just plain dont buy 
we try not to have controversial materials she said 
ms jones said the school board has not addressed the high 
schools book policy because only two members agreed it should be on 
the agenda and four are required

republican conservatives and moderates argue 
among themselves over just what political stripes george bush would 
wear if he wins the white house next week and some recent campaign 
utterances arent making the labeling job any easier 
speaking at the university of notre dame in south bend ind on 
tuesday the vice president talked for the first time of the kind of 
judges he would pick if elected for prospective supreme court 
vacancies 
i will appoint moderate persons of conservative views bush 
declared 
and while he went on to fault what he called the excessive 
judicial activism of the 60s and 70s his statement appeared 
designed to send a calming message to moderates that he would not 
appoint doctrinaire right wingers to the bench while at the same 
time allowing him to flash once more his credentials as a 
conservative 
the notre dame remarks in which bush seemed to be having it 
both ways underscore what many analysts view as bushs split 
political personality 
would he follow through as the designated heir to ronald reagans 
brand of conservatism 
or would he revert to the moderate bush of yore who favored the 
equal rights amendment opposed a constitutional ban on abortions 
and dismissed reagans 1980 proposal for tax cuts as voodoo 
economics 
both sides are keeping their fingers crossed 
basically hes more moderate than his image has been of recent 
years says rep james jeffords rvt a gop moderate i think 
some of the more conservative issues that president reagan has 
brought to the forefront like abortion will be more on the back 
burner with george bush thats what were hoping 
on the other hand david carmen a political consultant who was a 
key adviser to conservative rep jack kemp rny says of bush 
hes actually run to the right of reagan on some issues like 
abortion and socalled family issues i think hell be a 
conservative president 
bush never accused of ideological rigidity was a goldwater 
republican in 1966 when he was first elected to congress a 
rockefeller republican in 1980 when he first sought the presidency 
and a reagan republican ever since 
views are mixed on just how moderate or how conservative a bush 
presidency would be 
theres plenty evidence for either interpretation said 
william schneider a political analyst for the american enterprise 
institute the moderates think hes one of them good old george 
weve known him for years 
but hes also been running a tough ideological campaign going 
down the line conservative on all the major social issues hitting 
all the hot buttons 
hes going to have to choose which george bush he is the 
kinder gentler bush or one who says read my lips he cant keep 
on doing this forever schneider added 
many bush watchers suggest that if elected his presidency is 
more likely to resemble the middleoftheroad policies of former 
gop presidents nixon and ford than the ideological conservatism of 
reagan or the more liberal wing of the party represented by the late 
nelson rockefeller 
still brent scowcroft who was national security adviser in the 
ford administration and is now a bush consultant on international 
issues says the vice president is likely to be a rockefeller 
republican in foreign policy 
tough hardheaded no illusions more or less powerpolitics 
oriented with somewhat of less ideological content scowcroft 
said in an interview 
bush in campaign speeches has signaled a keen interest in 
negotiating further nuclear arms reduction pacts with soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev seems less committed than reagan to going full 
speed ahead with the star wars strategic defense shield and has 
emphasized negotiating cuts in eastwest conventional armies in 
europe 
on domestic issues bush has taken up the conservative banner and 
waved it coming out strongly against gun control and in favor of 
the death penalty urging a ban on abortions talking repeatedly of 
the pledge of allegiance in classrooms and criticizing the american 
civil liberties union 
but at the same time bush has argued for stronger protection of 
the environment has called for an increase in the minimum wage if 
accompanied by a lower minimum for young workers and has proposed 
a tax credit that could be used for day care 
in addition the men bush has surrounded himself with and who 
appear to be in line for key cabinet posts in a bush administration 
tend to be moderates many of them from the east 
they include former pennsylvania gov dick thornburgh now the 
attorney general nicholas brady a former new york investment 
banker who is now the treasury secretary former treasury secretary 
and longtime friend james a baker iii former deputy treasury 
secretary richard darman and harvard economist martin feldstein 
its looking like its going to be an eastern establishment 
administration said richard viguerie a conservative directmail 
specialist 
if baker who practiced a brand of nonideological pragmatism 
both as reagans firstterm chief of staff and as treasury 
secretary were to become secretary of state in a bush presidency 
as is widely assumed that would complicate life even further for 
conservatives viguerie said 
jim baker over the years rejected confrontation with liberals 
it would make a bush administration much more in tune with the nixon 
administration and were concerned about that were apprehensive 
still viguerie echoing sentiments of other republicans of 
various political persuasions says he doesnt want to be a naysayer 
im concerned about being negative at this point i want him to 
have a massive landslide and then the day after the election is 
when conservatives will speak out loud and clear 
rep jim leach riowa a gop moderate says he expects bush to 
be staunchly conservative on budget issues in terms of restraining 
spending but more progressive on other domestic matters 
hes made it clear he will give a greater priority to day care 
will be more environmentally sensitive bush doesnt wear 
progressiveness on his sleeve but is very likely to get substantial 
results leach said

former members of a commune will 
testify in the conspiracy trial of the groups leader that he 
plotted to obtain illegal student loans to prepare for the worlds 
economic collapse prosecutors say 
opening arguments began tuesday in the trial of george g 
jurcsek and his lieutenant mary orourke the pair both of 
mocksville nc were charged in may 1987 with conspiracy and theft 
by deception 
former members of the circle of friends testified at a grand jury 
hearing that the commune was a tightly controlled group led by 
jurcsek whose main purpose was allegedly to defraud the state 
student loan agency and several credit card companies out of more 
than 150000 
on tuesday deputy state attorney general john m fahy told the 
superior court jury that jurcsek and ms orourke controlled about 
32 circle of friends members who applied for about 64 guaranteed 
student loans 
fahy said jurcseks hold on the group which was based in nearby 
randolph and was comprised mostly of young women was based on his 
preaching of economic doom and of the inevitable collapse of the 
world economy by the turn of the century 
in grand jury testimony that has been made public as a result of 
pretrial motions several government witnesses described jurczek a 
68yearold hungarian immigrant as a man bent on leading the world 
after the collapse 
he presented himself as a mystic and a psychic who has the 
ability to foresee the future said barbara edwards a former 
member who testified for the government we considered ourselves 
students and he our teacher 
another former member diane desiderio said she participated in 
the fraud schemes because jurcsek taught her that possession was 
ninetenths of the law and that when the world economy failed it 
would be better to have money no matter how it was obtained 
defense attorneys for jurcsek and ms orourke tried to discredit 
the governments case as one based on hearsay the witnesses the 
attorneys said were either embittered because they left the group 
or were simply cooperating with authorities to obtain immunity from 
prosecution

the nomination of stuart a summit a park 
avenue lawyer and a republican to a judgeship on the 2nd circuit 
court of appeals was blocked in the final days of the last congress 
by sen alfonse damato rny sources said 
summit a partner with summit rovins amp feldesman received the 
unanimous approval of the senate judiciary committee in september 
after several hearings but his nomination never reached the senate 
floor and a source on capitol hill and another familiar with the 
nomination said it was damato who put a hold on it 
damato did not return numerous phone calls over several weeks 
seeking comment on tuesday his spokesman ed martin declined 
comment when asked whether damato blocked summit 
traditional senatorial courtesy allows a senator to put a 
hold on a judicial nomination which effectively kills it the 
identity of the senator is usually kept secret 
damatos action was ironic since it came on the heels of 
complaints from gop senators that democrats had held up 25 of their 
judicial nominees for more than a year in retaliation republicans 
blocked floor votes on key pieces of legislation until a compromise 
could be reached eleven of those nominees were then approved and 
sent to the floor but summit never crossed the finish line 
summit said in a telephone interview tuesday he had heard rumors 
for some time that his nomination was blocked but did not know for 
sure that damato was responsible 
if it is true im amazed he said i cannot imagine why 
summit said he had put in at least three calls to damato to find 
out if the report were true but damato had not called back on 
tuesday summit said he had given up trying 
summits nomination was engineered in large part by arnold burns 
his former law partner who at the time was the no 2 official at the 
justice department but summit lost his champion when burns resigned 
from justice last spring to protest thenattorney general edwin 
meeses ethical problems 
summit said he understood that attorney general dick thornburgh 
had tried to intervene on his behalf 
summit who seemed baffled by the politicization of his 
nomination noted that damato had even spoken at his confirmation 
hearings 
he very kindly attended the hearing in april of 1988 and spoke 
well of my credentials summit said 
damatos motives in blocking the nomination are unclear the new 
york law journal and manhattan lawyer two legal journals in new 
york city have reported that damato held up summit in retaliation 
for the judiciary committees treatment of two candidates he had 
recommended for the eastern district benches state supreme court 
justices robert roberto jr and howard e levitt both of long 
island 
roberto a former prosecutor withdrew in june after the 
judiciary committee learned he had engaged in a sex act with a 
16yearold prostitute while investigating a massage parlor in 1971 
roberto claimed his action was necessary for conviction and noted 
that he had testified about it in open court during prosecution of 
the case 
levitts nomination effectively died last month when the 
judiciary committee pulled his name from the agenda of one of its 
last meetings this session a committee aide speaking on condition 
of anonymity said he was pulled because the panel could not reach a 
consensus 
damato said recently he would resubmit levitts name for 
consideration next year

sen dan quayle is warning republicans 
against overconfidence in the waning days of the presidential 
campaign saying the gop could end up like thomas dewey in 1948 
arriving here tuesday night at the end of a long campaign day in 
ohio kentucky and indiana quayle said the polls have been all 
over the lot 
we believe in fact we have a small but marginally 
insignificant lead he told reporters 
two nationwide surveys released tuesday night show the republican 
ticket of george bush and quayle holding doubledigit leads of 12 
and 13 points in the final week before the election 
earlier while campaigning for indiana lt gov john mutz who is 
trying to succeed robert orr in quayles homestate of indiana the 
senator sought to deflect burgeoning speculation about whether his 
wife marilyn might be appointed to fill his vacant senate seat in 
the event of a bushquayle victory next tuesday 
its going to be bob orrs decision quayle said of talk 
within republican party circles in the state that mrs quayle might 
be offered the vacant seat during an interview last weekend on the 
syndicated program mclaughlin one on one quayles wife refused 
to flatly rule out such a possibility 
i think its a real honor for her to be considered quayle 
told reporters in evansville im not going to do anything to 
disrupt the discussion of course weve got a family and life 
is going to change a lot if the bushquayle ticket is elected he 
said 
quayle was appearing at a campaign rally today in this city on 
the bluffs before traveling to owensboro ky he has appearances 
scheduled later in the week in greenville and spartanburg sc and 
in oklahoma and alabama 
the senator who complained about lastminute scheduling changes 
dictated by the bush campaign headquarters in washington seemed 
buoyed by two appearances in his homestate one in jeffersonville 
and the second in evansville 
red white and blue balloons sailed in front of a flagwaving 
cheering crowd as the band struck up back home in indiana 
but when he arrived in memphis in late evening quayle deflected 
questions which assumed a republican party victory at the polls 
we believe this election could still go either way he said 
were not taking anything for granted that would be absolutely 
lethal 
one way you can lose an election is to sit back and relax and 
well end up like dewey did quayle said 
he was referring to thomas deweys upset loss to democrat harry 
truman 40 years ago in an election that virtually all the experts 
had given to dewey

the justice department is investigating its 
chief pornography prosecutor for possible misuse of travel funds 
government sources said 
the office of professional responsibility which examines 
allegations of wrongdoing by department employees is carrying out 
the probe of h robert showers with the assistance of fbi agents 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity told the associated 
press 
investigators are trying to determine whether showers scheduled 
official trips at taxpayer expense that permitted him to attend 
meetings of christian religious groups in his hometown of raleigh 
nc and other cities the sources said tuesday 
justice department regulations specify that employees must use 
the least expensive form of travel when engaging in government 
business 
justice department spokesman john russell and fbi spokesman 
william carter declined to confirm that any investigation of showers 
is under way 
the sources however said investigators are studying whether 
showers while traveling on department business took indirect 
flights to cities hundreds of miles out of his way to attend 
religious meetings 
the long island ny newspaper newsday reported monday that 
investigators have been told that showers arranged meetings with 
federal prosecutors during the same weeks as baptist conventions 
that he arranged to change planes in the city hosting the 
convention attended the religious meetings and then continued on to 
the city where he conducted department business 
newsday also quoted sources as saying that several of showers 
conferences with prosecutors were extremely brief and that there is 
a possibility showers may have taken trips that were unnecessary 
the sources told newsday that showers traveled at government expense 
to raleigh many times attending religious meetings there 
showers was named to head up the departments national obscenity 
enforcement unit in 1986 by attorney general edwin meese iii he had 
been an assistant us attorney in raleigh nc before being 
brought to washington as a special assistant to meese 
the office of professional responsibility scrutinized showers 
earlier this year after he allegedly asked a colleague to destroy a 
memo in connection with a pornography case sources said at the time 
showers has been placed on administrative leave

while the press hailed him as young superstar 
and wall street poured millions into his zzzz best carpet cleaning 
company barry minkow says he was just a front man for the mob 
the 22yearold minkow crying on the witness stand at his 
federal securities fraud trial chronicled the rise and fall of his 
sham company and admitted that the success of his 
multimilliondollar fraud went to his head 
i had my ferrari and i was the press golden boy he sobbed 
tuesday i said arent i great im mr cool and then they 
mobsters would put me in my place that i was just a front man for 
the mob 
minkow who admits he perpetrated the fraud on investors 
addressed his comments directly to the jurors as he sought to 
convince them he was a victim of duress not a con man acting on 
free will as prosecutors allege 
as the fraud escalated and the company went public in 1986 
minkow said he was throwing up blood every night from beatings by 
the mob 
banks and investors handed over millions unaware that by the 
time zzzz best traded on wall street it was 7 million in debt and 
was in the control of mobsters he said 
minkow is charged with 57 counts of securities credit card and 
mail fraud ten other defendants have pleaded guilty accountant 
norman rothberg is on trial with minkow charged with taking a bribe 
to hide zzzz bests frauds 
minkow took the stand as the first defense witness oct 25 the 
prosecution rested its case on oct 21 after calling 47 witnesses 
and introducing thousands of exhibits 
minkow testified that a cadre of organized crime figures who 
claimed connections to the genovese and colombo crime families 
dictated his every move as he prepared a 15 million stock offering 
i just was a puppet he said 
minkow who started his carpet cleaning company at age 16 in his 
parents garage said he was instructed by mobsters to conduct a 
road show to sell investors on the financial wonders of zzzz best 
while perpetuating a massive fraud 
he said he helped prepare a prospectus on the company which was 
a lie and carried out a complex series of financial maneuvers 
to show income that didnt exist to do this he said he took 7 
million in bank loans and he opened five branch offices 
the offices were so we could show that we were the great 
7eleven of carpet cleaning he said it was just so i could say 
to the wall street bankers were wonderful buy our stock and we 
were nothing we were losing money 
was this your idea defense attorney david kenner asked 
minkow repeatedly as he detailed features of the fraud 
no it was not said minkow who blamed mobsters 
asked why he never went to police minkow said he was afraid and 
detailed alleged acts of brutality against him 
he testified that once a mobster held his head underwater and 
another time he was kicked in the groin for resisting the loan scam 
i was scared to death he said

vitamin e can ease a serious side effect of 
schizophrenia medication and team up with vitamin c to help slow the 
course of parkinsons disease which afflicts at least 350000 
americans two studies suggest 
in both cases it appeared to work by helping protect the brain 
against damage from chemical entities called free radicals which 
are produced by the body said the researchers who described their 
studies tuesday at a conference on vitamin e sponsored by the new 
york academy of sciences 
jean lud cadet of the columbia university college of physicians 
and surgeons in new york said vitamin e appeared to reduce symptoms 
of tardive dyskinesia which appears in 20 percent to 30 percent of 
people taking antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia or some 
other illnesses 
the condition produces jerky movements of the facial muscles and 
slow writhing movements of the limbs and sometimes the trunk 
cadets experiment found that 13 of 15 patients responded to 
fourweek treatments with vitamin e treatments cut the average 
severity of symptoms almost in half as measured by a standard 
rating scale and compared to when patients took a placebo 
thats really quite impressive said john davis director of 
research at the illinois state psychiatric institute and a member of 
the american psychiatric associations task force on tardive 
dyskinesia 
no proven treatment is known now for the condition davis said in 
a telephone interview 
researchers hope to go beyond shortterm easing of symptoms to 
drugs that produce longterm elimination or reduction in symptoms 
he said investigation of why vitamin e helps patients may aid in 
reaching that goal by revealing fundamental secrets of the 
condition he said 
a separate study found that people in early stages of parkinsons 
disease who took vitamins e and c showed slower progression of 
disease than other patients did 
the 14 patients were able to delay starting standard treatment 
for 25 years longer than other patients said stanley fahn 
director of parkinsonism and movement disorder research at columbia 
stressing that the results are preliminary fahn said researchers 
at 28 institutions have signed up 800 patients for a 10 million 
federally funded study of the approach 
parkinsons disease is often characterized by tremors rigidity 
or loss of balance drugs can control symptoms but their effect can 
become sporadic and side effects can include psychological 
disturbances and impairment of movement 
the disease is caused by death of brain cells that produce 
dopamine which brain cells use to communicate nobody know why the 
cells die 
fahn said his experiment was based on a hypothesis that the cells 
are harmed by free radicals created by the cells themselves 
parkinsons may arise because the body cannot properly handle the 
radicals or it creates too many of them he said 
the vitamin experiment tested the idea of using antioxidants 
substances that can scavenge free radicals or slow their formation 
the disease progressed more slowly in the 14 patients who took 
high doses of the vitamins than in a group of patients observed in 
chicago who did not get the vitamin treatment he said 
the result is just a suggestion of a way to go not an answer 
in itself fahn said 
the antioxidant approach is very promising said bala 
manyam director of the parkinsons disease and movement disorders 
clinic at the southern illinois university school of medicine in 
springfield 
gunter haase director of the neurology department at the 
pennsylvania hospital in philadelphia called the approach 
interesting 
if further studies bear out the reports by dr fahn then we

an american who said he helped import and 
distribute 56 tons of cocaine gave the jury at a moneylaundering 
trial an inside look at the colombian drug world 
max mermelstein had testified as a government witness in two 
other trials but his testimony tuesday at the trial of carlos 
restrepo marked the first time he discussed the medellin cartels 
operations in this country said us attorney stanley twardy 
the cartel believed to be responsible for much of us cocaine 
imports was described by mermelstein as a looseknit organization 
of colombias cocaine traffickers 
mermelsteins testimony was offered to establish the identity of 
key figures in the colombian drug world and their methods of 
operation and not to suggest that restrepo was a member of the 
medellin cartel us district judge jose cabranes told the jury 
the government does not allege that restrepo was a member of the 
cartel and mermelstein said he did not know restrepo a businesman 
in the colombian town of medellin who is accused of running a 
largescale moneylaundering operation for cartel members 
restrepo was arrested in june 1987 as a result of an fbi 
sting in greenwich he was accused of laundering more than 10 
million through a front corporation set up by undercover agents 
his attorney claims he was engaged in legitimate currency 
exchange 
to prove the crime of moneylaundering prosecutors must show 
that restrepo knew the source of the money and that it represented 
the proceeds of unlawful acts and that he exchanged the money in an 
attempt to carry on the unlawful activity or to conceal its origin 
mermelstein who ran his drug operation out of miami pleaded 
guilty in april 1986 in los angeles to cocaine conspiracy and 
possession charges he was sentenced last year to the two years he 
had already served in prison following his arrest and given 
lifetime special parole 
twardy said outside the court that mermelstein was accepted into 
the federal witness protection program 
mermelstein told the jury that he became involved in cocaine 
trafficking in 1978 when he began working with a man associated with 
the cartel mermelstein estimated that he helped arrange the 
shipment and distribution of about 56 tons of cocaine 
he said his role included dispatching pilots to bring the cocaine 
into the united states distributing the cocaine and transferring 
the payments to his bosses 
mermelstein said he personally was responsible for collecting and 
transferring about 300 million in drug proceeds 
about threequarters of the cash was flown back to colombia 
while the rest was either turned over to money launderers 
representatives or hidden in articles shipped to the south american 
country he testified 
mermelstein said he attended a good number of cartel 
meetings but made only one trip to medellin in 1984 to attend a 
party he said was thrown by a cartel member all the meetings were 
designed to see how more and more cocaine could be brought into 
the us he said 
mermelstein identified the pictures of seven colombians 
including that of pablo escobar in a recorded discussion with 
undercover agents restrepo identified escobar as the source of much 
of his money and one of the largest cocaine traffickers in the 
colombian city of medellin

for a century people have flocked to cape cod and 
its nearby islands with retirement dreams and tourist dollars but 
many residents of the sandy peninsula are growing increasingly wary 
and weary of outsiders 
the cape cod that i grew up in is almost extinct said ruth 
rusher the third generation of her family to make her home on the 
cape 
mrs rusher 78 who lives in a house in hyannis that was built 
when she was born feels its almost too late to save the capes 
relaxed and quiet past as shopping centers and fastfood joints 
spring up like mushrooms 
some call the opposition to development a burnthebridge 
syndrome a reference to the two spans over the cape cod canal that 
connect the 65mile stretch of beach to the massachusetts mainland 
among the signs of discontent voters next week will face two 
ballot questions to limit development residents of nantucket and 
marthas vineyard are fighting to curb ferry traffic to those 
islands and a case to ban recreational vehicles from the beaches 
was scheduled to go to federal court today 
the bottom line is awareness of the limits and the ability to 
recognize when enough is enough said susan nickerson executive 
director of the association for the preservation of cape cod 
the 4000member group is behind the two nonbinding ballot 
resolutions that would halt new construction until a capewide 
regulating agency can be established to control growth 
the population of cape cod has swelled 540 percent during the 
past 60 years while the rest of the state has grown just 50 percent 
ms nickerson said yearround residents number about 173000 a 
figure that more than triples in the summertime according to the 
barnstable county economic planning commission 
despite these figures members of the cape real estate industry 
are wary of the effort to stop growth even temporarily though they 
agree with the principle said nancy harrison vice president of the 
cape cod home builders association 
the home builders point of view is you dont have to stop 
growth to put controls on the way building takes place there are 
zoning controls already said ms harrison she said her groups 
250 firms worry about what could happen at the end of a moratorium 
last week the woods hole marthas vineyard and nantucket 
steamship authority a state agency rejected an application from a 
ferry operator to run a highspeed catamaran service linking boston 
with nantucket and marthas vineyard 
the wouldbe operator argued the service would ease the 
horrendous summertime traffic jams on cape cod by allowing visitors 
and residents to travel by boat directly from boston to the two 
islands rather than by car to the cape and then to the islands via 
ferry 
lyn zimmerman of nantucket who organized residents to oppose the 
catamarans said the authoritys refusal to permit such service was 
an important step toward helping her island cope with growing crowds 
of summer visitors 
state sen william q maclean jr disagreed even though he owns 
a home on nantucket in fact he said its because he could only 
finally afford that home in 1980 that he wants others to have access 
to the islands unspoiled turnofthe century charm 
mclean called the opposition to the new boat service selfish 
its the old attitude i have something that you dont have 
and youre not going to have it said maclean who filed a bill 
monday that would strip the steamship authority of its power to 
license ferry operators 
replied ms zimmerman i dont think that people in other parts 
of the state that senator maclean represents realize how difficult 
it is for a community like ours to provide services 
meanwhile conservationists are fighting an attempt by the 
interior department to ease national park service restrictions on 
the use of offroad vehicles at the cape cod national seashore a 
strip of pristine beach and brush that lines about half of the 
capes length 
the new regulations would allow dune buggies to scoot along the 
protected shore but not in the dunes or wetlands 
the federal appeals court in boston was scheduled to hear 
arguments today in a lawsuit brought by the bostonbased 
conservation law foundation

he called for increased awareness among controllers and pilots of 
the need for clear and accurate communications as they work in an 
environment of greater traffic loads 
mcartor said as many as 80 percent of pilot reports on aviation 
incidents involve some sort of communications lapse

the washington post today said it would not 
endorse either major party candidate for president calling this 
years race a terrible campaign a national disappointment 
in a long editorial entitled no endorsement the newspapers 
editors said we would have liked to support democrat michael 
dukakis but were especially alarmed at his deficiencies in foreign 
affairs and defense 
the editorial said republican george bush made himself too 
beholden to the far right of the party and he is really the major 
source and cause of the tawdriness of this campaign 
mentioning bushs controversial choice of a running mate it said 
the prospect of dan quayles suddenly having to succeed him in 
office will remain a legitimate anxiety 
this has been a terrible campaign a national disappointment 
the newspaper said for our part we do not feel that the we 
can in good faith argue for the vindication of the cheap shots that 
have animated george bushs campaign or close our eyes to 
alarming deficiencies of the democratic candidate as a prospective 
president

michael dukakis beat george bush in his 
hometown but it was all downhill from there in a mock election that 
might make some dukakis boosters happy the torch hasnt yet been 
passed to a new generation 
high school students nationwide tuesday chose vice president bush 
for president by a 21 margin prompting observations that the tally 
is a clear signal the old guard has overtaken the new frontier among 
the nations youth 
one person put it rather succinctly the young people have 
grown up under the reagan administration and they are rather 
complacent said kim robert nilsen a spokesman for the northfield 
mount hermon school 
issues do not tend to surface and be debated in any great 
fashion nilsen said with no burning issues theres probably 
no real reason to contemplate going in another direction 
northfield a private 1160student school in northwestern 
massachusetts coordinated what it called the first nationwide 
presidential election run by high school students 
casting ballots a week before the real election were 
ninththrough 12thgraders at two schools in every state from 
25student weiser high in idaho to 1900student brookline high in 
massachusetts the alma mater of dukakis the states democratic 
governor 
in early returns bush the republican candidate received 24758 
popular votes and 315 electoral votes while dukakis won 12682 
popular votes and 73 electoral votes said nilsen 
the only states won by dukakis were massachusetts minnesota 
south dakota colorado and arkansas plus the district of columbia 
said nilsen who added that votes had not yet been received from 
vermont and michigan new york and missouri were hardfought losses 
for the dukakis camp 
alternative party candidates received a scattering of votes with 
national alliance party candidate lenora fuliani winning 1085 
libertarian party candidate ron paul taking 514 and consumer party 
candidate eugene mccarthy winning 161 nilsen said 
in dukakis hometown of brookline the democrat received 1008 
votes to 289 for bush in northfield where all the results were 
phoned in dukakis took 518 votes while bush won 207 
nilsen said he was very encouraged by the total student turnout 
which he said was a 71 percent response at the schools with a total 
enrollment of 75000 students 
thats really heartening i think were going to be in good 
hands some time in the future he said 
he said the mock election was designed as a civics lesson for 
students who will be old enough to make their votes count in the 
real event in 1992 
in a room he called election central students manned five 
phone lines taking the tallies and running them upstairs to a staff 
member at the controls of an election computer that tabulated the 
popular vote and the electoral college winner 
we know mock elections are held in schools all over the united 
states but theyve never been tied together before nilsen said 
some of the 150 northfield mount hermon students who volunteered 
to work on the project operated a mock television anchor booth 
posted results on a huge map of the united states and hung bunting 
and balloons 
the election which cost 6000 was financed by 50 fees from 
each school and donations ranging up to 500 from alumni of 
northfield mount hermon 
american history teacher james shea said organizers sent notice 
of the election to schools on the 1987 exemplary schools list 
compiled by the us department of education some 270 schools asked 
to take part in the election 
the organizers chose 54 private schools and 46 public schools 
roughly one of each from each state and the district of columbia 
on a firstcome basis 
shea said one school in anchorage responded to the notice by 
protesting that the mock election might influence the real one 
naturally we were flattered someone would think that he said

an army of volunteers like the one that helped put 
a damper on devils night arson fires last weekend may be deployed 
one day to combat crack houses and youth gunfights says mayor 
coleman a young 
anytime an aroused community comes together to deal with a 
problem that problem can be resolved young said tuesday what 
youve seen is a resolution of the devils night problem 
about 20000 civilians joined police and firefighters in 
patrolling the streets keeping detroits annual halloween weekend 
fire outbreak well below last years level and near the citys 
normal rate young said 
from saturday through monday 229 fires broke out a drop of 21 
percent from last year the mayor said devils night is the night 
before halloween 
on saturday a belowaverage number of 56 fires broke out and 
mondays 69 blazes were typical for any night of the year in the 
city young said officials reported 104 fires sunday 
this was the quietest devils night in years he said the 
youngsters are beginning to get the message 
there were a lot of pyromaniacs who were attracted to 
detroit young said its good to see these people have lost 
interest theyre going elsewhere for their kicks 
young invited community leaders to city hall and praised the 
volunteers he said the city may organize similar volunteer efforts 
to fight crack houses and the use of handguns by youths 
almost anything we try to do together we can do he said i 
think this shows that

dusktodawn weekend curfew next year 
we cannot afford to stand idle and assume weve won the war we 
need to keep the heat on he said 
police detained 452 youths who defied the 6 pm6 am curfew 
he said eight people were arrested on arson charges 
despite the crackdown devils night flames left three families 
homeless 
the number of fires has dropped steadily since 1984 when the

the rightwing likud bloc and rival leftleaning 
labor party deadlocked in parliamentary elections today courted 
israels four religious parties in a bid to form a coalition 
government 
likud had the early edge because it won the most votes in 
tuesdays balloting and is ideologically more compatible with the 
small religious parties that now hold the balance of power 
based on the facts we have before us it seems that the 
situation commands and enables the likud to form israels next 
government prime minister yitzhak shamir who heads likud told 
supporters at campaign headquarters during a nationally televised 
speech early today 
with 99 percent of the 4840 polling stations reporting likud 
had 39 seats in the 120member knesset or parliament labor had 38 
and the religious parties 18 three of labors leftwing allies won 
10 seats three rightist likud allies seven seats and three 
araboriented lists took eight seats 
sixtyone seats are needed to govern but because neither major 
party has ever won an absolute majority small parties have 
influence beyond their numbers like this year the 1984 elections 
ended in deadlock with labor winning 44 seats and likud 41 
this election is seen as crucial in determining the future of the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip and setting policy toward israels 
arab enemies 
a protracted palestinian insurrection that began dec 8 in the 
occupied lands has claimed the lives of at least 304 palestinians 
and 10 israelis on sunday a firebomb attack in the west bank 
killed a jewish woman and her three sons 
several religious party leaders said they were not yet ready to 
commit themselves to either labor or the likud which means unity in 
hebrew complex negotiations over portfolios and policy could drag 
on for weeks 
labor headed by foreign minister shimon peres advocates an 
international middle east peace conference and trading some land for 
peace likud opposes both it calls for direct talks with israels 
arab neighbors and limited selfrule for palestinians 
shamir 73 rejected allegations from the leftist camp that a 
likudled government would heighten chances of war he said as prime 
minister he would make every effort to reach peace with our arab 
neighbors as quickly as possible 
benny begin son of likud founder and former prime minister 
menachem begin claimed labors peace plan was dead there will be 
no international conference and parts of eastern israel the west 
bank will not be handed over to a foreign power he said on 
israel radio 
peres meanwhile said labor was still a contender and would seek 
to woo the religious parties i reject likuds attempt to annex 
the religious vote he told supporters 
i would not say that all religious people are necessarily 
rightwing peres 65 later told israel radio we shall hear 
what they propose and if they all want the same thing 
both labor and likud scheduled meetings today with the religious 
parties the religious bloc which grew from 14 to 18 seats 
consists of the national religious party and three ultraorthodox 
groups shas agudat israel and torah flag 
the national religious party opposes territorial compromise but 
the other three parties are more ambiguous on the peace issue and 
have not ruled out a coalition with labor 
the religious parties will be able to exact a high price from 
either coalition partner for example both shas and the national 
religious party immediately demanded three cabinet posts israeli 
radio said 
shamir indicated all issues on the religious agenda are up for 
grabs including the key demand that only those converted to judaism 
by an orthodox rabbi should be considered jewish such a move could 
alienate american jews most of whom belong to the reform and 
conservative branches of judaism 
no issues are taboo shamir told israel radio 
three new parties entered parliament including moledet or 
homeland which advocates the ouster from the occupied lands of the 
15 million palestinians who live there likud needs the moledets 
support to form a rightistreligious coalition but begin said 
moledets platform would never be adopted as government policy 
about 79 percent of israels 29 million eligible voters went to 
polls tuesday 13000 police and civil guards protected the polling 
sites the army sealed off the occupied territories where a general 
strike entered its second day today

a man who tried to stage a fake halloween 
hanging in a tavern but wound up choking to death in front of 
unsuspecting patrons had a stupid look on his face like he was 
kidding around a witness says 
milton michael tyree 41 died monday night when a harness 
hed rigged to simulate a hanging at the cantab lounge slipped 
choking him said police detective james dwyer 
when he walked into the bar tyree had his face painted white 
was wearing a black hood and carried a sickle like the grim 
reaper said witness mike dorman 
he came in and stood up on a chair and hitched himself to a 
beam dorman said somebody just pulled the chair out he didnt 
look uncomfortable at all he was moving his arms and everything he 
always had a stupid look on his face like he was kidding around 
dwyer said the harness slipped and he really was hanging but 
it took the crowd a while to realize what was happening when 
our officers arrived he was down someone had cut him down but 
it was too late 
tyree was taken to massachusetts general hospital where doctors 
spent the night trying to revive him he was pronounced dead tuesday 
morning said hospital spokesman martin bander 
police said 60 to 70 people were in the bar during the hanging 
but bar owner richard fitzgerald said he believed there were only 15 
or 20 
fitzgerald said he stopped tyree from performing the parlor trick 
earlier monday evening 
he came in dressed in a halloween costume he looked like some 
kind of a creature i dont know what he was supposed to be and he 
had a noose round his neck with about a sixinch rope fitzgerald 
said he had this harness around his body a kind of nylon net 
which he lifted up his costume and showed me 
the next thing i knew fitzgerald recalled i was sitting 
in the corner watching the ball game and a waitress said to me do 
you see whats going on over there 
fitzgerald said he turned around and saw tyree standing on a 
chair at the back of the bar attaching the rope to a wooden beam 
across the ceiling 
i said to him what do you think youre doing and he said 
dont worry about me ive done this lots of times before i said 
well youre not doing it in here 
tyree then left the bar but he returned an hour later after 
fitzgerald had gone home for the night to try the stunt again 
the second time it proved fatal

four tiny religious parties were the surprise 
winners in israels election securing enough votes to tip the 
scales of power and determine who heads the next coalition 
government 
orthodox and ultraorthodox parties won 18 seats tuesday in the 
120member parliament an increase of four seats from 1984 
analysts were surprised by the outcome which had not registered 
in preelection polls it was seen as a reflection of the religious 
communitys demographic growth and a trend toward greater political 
involvement 
the religious parties now have a great deal of bargaining power 
because neither the rightwing likud bloc with its 39 seats nor the 
leftofcenter labor party with 38 can form a coalition alone 
we have been invited both by prime minister yitzhak shamir and 
by shimon peres said avner shaki referring to likud and labor 
leaders requests to negotiate with his national religious party 
we will ask for the fulfilment of demands as we see fit 
defense minister yitzhak rabin of labor said the religious 
parties hold the key to determining which party will put a 
government together 
but while the religious parties have not ruled out joining a 
laborled coalition they would make strange bedfellows with labors 
traditional allies the socialist mapam party and the leftist 
citizens rights movement which takes a strong stand against 
religious coercion 
we will with the help of god first and foremost improve the 
quality of life for the ultraorthodox community said avraham 
ravitz leader of the new religious party torah flag which won two 
seats in the knesset or parliament at the top of the orthodox 
agenda is a controversial demand to revise israels law of return 
which grants automatic citizenship to all jews the orthodox want 
israel to recognize as jewish only those born to a jewish mother or 
converted by an orthodox rabbi 
a change in the law would alienate large numbers of jews who live 
in the united states and elsewhere abroad where orthodoxy is on the 
decline and interfaith marriages abound 
the religious parties also want to see abortions outlawed and 
commercial activity banned on the jewish sabbath with the exception 
of the national religious party most religious parties favor 
continued exemptions from army service for seminary students a 
cause for resentment among secular israelis 
there can be no security without the help of god without gods 
hand guiding the triggers of our soldiers there never was any 
success and can be no success said rabbi moshe zeev feldman head 
of the agudat israel party 
positions on the arabisraeli conflict are ambiguous while the 
orthodox parties have a religious attachment to the occupied west 
bank because of historic biblical ties they tend to shy away from 
taking a strong political line on the areas 
only the national religious party which has a more nationalistic 
line than the others takes a firm stand against territorial 
compromise 
the palestinian revolt against israeli rule in the west bank and 
gaza strip was the primary issue in the campaign the nearly 
11monthold revolt has claimed the lives of more than 300 arabs and 
10 israelis 
the nrp which won four seats in 1984 gained one seat tuesday 
shas dedicated to preserving the traditions of jews from arab 
countries and north africa won six seats compared to last terms 
four 
agudat israel representing observant europeanborn jews 
increased its seats from two to five torah flag is an agudat israel 
offshoot 
even though the four parties had a net gain of six seats the 
increase in the religious bloc was only four seats from 14 to 18 
because two tiny religious factions merged with other parties

a state appeals court ruled that a 
chemical company was responsible for poisoning residents with toxic 
emissions but said a trial judge was correct in throwing out a 50 
million damage award against the plant 
the missouri court of appeals agreed tuesday that alcolac inc 
had been reckless and utterly indifferent but said it was 
forced to dismiss the verdict because each of the 31 plaintiffs was 
not considered separately 
the court ordered new trials to decide how much each persons 
health was affected by the 10yearold plant in rural sedalia and 
how much each should be awarded in actual and punitive damages 
the judges also cited errors at the original trial including 
notorious and inflammatory statements that damage to clients 
immune systems amounted to a type of chemically induced aids 
the company which produces chemicals used in making paints and 
plastics contended at the 1985 trial that people living near the 
plant were already sick when it began operations or the ills they 
suffered were because they were old 
but experts testified that people surrounding the plant were 
likely to contract cancer and would have a shortened life span 
because of the plant the plaintiffs testified about burning eyes 
and nasal and throat problems that began when the plant opened 
two of the original 31 plaintiffs have died one committed 
suicide a death that his wife blamed on depression caused by the 
plant which was within view of his front porch 
joyce sommers one of the plaintiffs said she was resigned to 
more lengthy trial proceedings before the matter is settled 
i guess we arent going to have much choice but to have another 
trial if we want to win the case she said im not happy about 
it and i know the other people wont be happy either 
alcolac maintains that no evidence proves emissions from the 
plant were responsible for illnesses suffered by the plaintiffs who 
are members of 13 families alvin d shapiro an attorney for the 
company said he was still studying the latest decision and declined 
comment 
lantz welch who represented the plaintiffs said the appeals 
court ruling was one of the options 
welch had told the appeals court that problems in the plant were 
factually amazing he cited balls of chemical foam the size of 
pickup trucks floating across the countryside orchards and poultry 
flocks decimated by fumes and toxic waste burned under cover of 
darkness 
jackson county circuit judge thomas j helms had ruled that the 
jury violated constitutional guidelines by awarding identical 
damages of 200000 in actual damages and 14 million in punitive 
damages to each plaintiff 
the appeals court however said it did not agree that 
constitutional guidelines had been broken 
the court ordered a new trial be held to decide punitive damages 
and a series of trials or a consolidated trial be held to determine 
actual damages for each plaintiff

the us dollar fell today against the japanese yen 
despite the intervention of the nations central bank while share 
prices inched down on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar closed at 12468 yen down 062 yen from tuesdays 
close of 12530 yen the currency opened at 12482 yen and even 
though the bank of japan began buying dollars it fell lower and 
ranged between 1244012485 yen 
it was the third straight day the bank of japan intervened in the 
market in an effort to keep the dollar from declining said takamasa 
yamasaki of the daiwa bank 
he said the move and a similar intervention in the united states 
has not worked because market players are thinking the banks move 
was just one of the temporary political tactics ahead of the us 
presidential election on nov 8 
unless the weaker dollar makes investors worry about negative 
effects to the japanese economy the current trend is likely to 
continue yamasaki said 
on the stock exchange market the 225issue nikkei stock average 
lost 2841 points or 01 percent closing at 2798526 the index 
gained 6033 points shortly after the market opened then gradually 
declined 
share prices fell because some investors sold issues for 
profittaking following seven straight days of market gains that 
ended tuesday said an analyst with nomura securities japans 
largest brokerage 
trading was active with volume on the first section estimated at 
19 billion shares

carl sandburg may be remembered as the 
author of such serious works as his biography of lincoln but a new 
book may put the prairie bard in a different light 
called fables foibles and foobles the book of prose by 
sandburg shows a silly side to the pulitzer prizewinning writer 
george hendrick an english professor at the university of 
illinois said the stories were stored with other sandburg papers in 
an asheville nc bank vault after his death in 1967 
after sandburgs oldest daughter margaret introduced hendrick 
to the material in 1982 he proposed to put them into a book 
heres an example 
a fly a flea and a flick talked about books and reading 
the fly said he always counted the pages first to see whether 
there were too many or not enough 
the flea said he always ran through the book first and marked 
the pages to skip 
the flick said i always begin reading a book wherever i open 
it then yawning and the farther back the better 
sandburg is mostly identified with the biography of lincoln 
which won him a pulitzer and chicago the stirring poem that 
gave the town its moniker city of big shoulders 
what people tend to forget is he always had an outrageous sense 
of humor hendrick said tuesday 
sandburg wrote these fables over a long period of time he 
said some were written when his family was in chicago some in 
michigan and some in north carolina he probably had in mind to tell 
them to his grandchildren 
like a troubadour sandburg enjoyed traveling between towns to 
deliver public readings and lectures after the crowds had gone 
home he would hold private readings for friends and bring out the 
funny verse 
he clearly was having fun with the sound of words hendrick 
said and the whole idea that was going around in the 1930s and 
40s a real serious one about how to read a book sandburg made it 
into a comedy 
fables foibles and foobles published in september by the 
university of illinois press deals with critics the subject of 
reading politics and just fun the professor said 
why did sandburg fail to publish these works when he was alive 
that is of course a great mystery hendrick said clearly 
it wasnt material that would embarrass anyone its funny i think 
sandburg saw this material as work for his private hours

the pingpong balls bobbled around then out 
popped the one telling dessie singleton where she will live after 
the home she has lived in for 35 years is destroyed 
ms singleton was among 19 families who took part in a unique 
lottery tuesday night one that would determine who would get which 
lot when an entire neighborhood is relocated to make way for the new 
chicago white sox stadium 
i hate to move but since ive got to move i guess theyre 
giving us a fair deal ms singleton said as she followed the 
bouncing balls 
when the american league baseball team decided on a new home 
across the street from 78yearold comiskey park residents of the 
neighborhood protested that their closeknit community would be torn 
apart 
so officials building the 150 million ballpark agreed to move 
the resident homeowners as a group into a new neighborhood of their 
choice those who didnt want to were given fairmarket value for 
their homes plus 25000 
how do you go in and give one lot to one person and another lot 
to another person asked georgia petropoulos project manager for 
the rescorp deveopment co which is overseeing the 10 million 
relocation i think everyone realizes a lottery is the fairest 
way to do it 
the city council and the citys landmark commission still must 
approve the cost of the sites and plans for the homes 
while most residents agreed the lottery was fair they were not 
as impressed with the fairness of the move itself 
it is not our choice its our second choice said susie 
myers who lives with her sister and 95yearold father this has 
been home to me for 46 years its not my decision to move so it 
does not make me happy 
and most of them didnt have much of a preference as to which lot 
they were assigned so while they enjoyed seeing their old friends 
at the lottery in a school cafeteria nobody really felt they lost 
more than the next person 
actually it didnt matter to me said eightyear resident 
mary marshall im just glad its over with 
the neighbors will be moved from their primarily bluecollar 
neighborhood across the dan ryan expressway to a redeveloping 
middleincome neighborhood called the gap because their new homes 
will not be ready until the end of summer they will move first to 
temporary housing when they leave their old homes in january 
some residents of the gap fear the new homes will not fit into 
the historic district that includes several houses designed by frank 
lloyd wright they have objected to the design plans complaining 
the new homes would be made of a plaster substitute instead of stone 
were clearly helping the community in that 19 vacant lots will 
have 19 new homes on them countered peter bynoe director of the 
illinois sports facilities authority which is building the stadium 
other issues in terms of the economic stability of the new 
residents are unfounded 
but when the white sox move into their new ballpark in 1991 they 
may find theyve lost some friends as well as neighbors 
at one time i was a sox fan but not anymore said ms myers

a black freelance journalist 
has been sentenced to four years in prison for failing to report the 
whereabouts of two suspected african national congress guerrillas 
themba khumalo 31 freelanced for several western news 
organizations at the time of his arrest in june 1987 he was 
sentenced tuesday in johnnesburg magistrates court to two concurrent 
fouryear terms 
according to testimony khumalo was approached in early 1987 by 
winnie mandela wife of jailed anc leader nelson mandela and asked 
to help find accommodation for youths fleeing to the johannesburg 
area from political unrest in natal province 
the charges against khumalo concerned two young men whom he 
subsequently aided one purportedly confided to khumalo that he was 
an anc guerrilla while the other purportedly was seen by the 
journalist handling a firearm 
in mitigation defense lawyers argued that khumalos career and 
possibly his life could have been in jeopardy if he had become known 
as an informer

the new york post says it will intensify new 
yorks heated newspaper competition by launching a sunday edition 
the owner of the spirited morning tabloid that came close to 
extinction earlier this year said tuesday he wants to compete seven 
days a week with the new york times the daily news and newsday 
the sunday edition complete with color comics and a magazine 
supplement is scheduled to make its debut march 5 and sell for 1 
the decision for the project came after repeated requests and 
offers of support from our major advertisers and dealers post 
owner peter s kalikow said 
the millionaire real estate developer also predicted that the 
post after years of losses would show a profit next year 
current losses are a minor fraction of the 650000 a week 
when we bought the paper last march from rupert murdoch he said 
at a news conference he declined to provide specific numbers 
kalikow said he would invest 25 million in the sunday edition 
and increase the papers staff by about 60 including 30 reporters 
and editors 
an initial press run of 500000 copies was expected he said 
newspaper analyst john morton called it a bold move but one i 
think they had to make if they want to make the post a viable 
enterprise 
in successful newspapers which the post is not sunday 
papers account for 40 to 50 percent of revenue he said the 
danger is that advertisers wont increase their post advertising 
budgets but spread them thinner to cover an additional day he said 
however eric philo an analyst for the investment firm goldman 
sachs said he didnt see a place for another sunday paper in new 
york and predicted it only would increase the financial drain on the 
post 
union reaction was favorable 
i get the impression that kalikows here to stay over the 
long haul said tom pennacchio secretary treasurer of the 
newspaper guild which represents the posts editorial staff 
pennacchio said he earlier joined others in believing kalikow was 
more interested in the posts valuable lower manhattan property than 
the paper itself 
the post the nations oldest continuously published daily 
newspaper was on the verge of ceasing publication when kalikow and 
murdoch negotiated major concessions and buyouts from the papers 
unions 
since then kalikow said both the financial as well as the 
editorial aspects of the paper have improved far beyond our 
expectations and therefore weve moved up the sunday publication 
from a date some time in our original plans of 1991 to 1989

documents dating to the dawn of the republic led 
a federal appeals court to reject an indian tribes claim to 5 
million acres of land in new york state 
the decision tuesday upheld a lower court ruling against the 
oneida indian nation which claims it has a right to land stretching 
from canada to pennsylvania 
the oneidas joined by four of the five other tribes that made up 
the oncemighty iroquois confederacy sought to overturn treaties 
made in 1785 and 1788 under which the land was sold for about 
50000 
the oneidas claimed the articles of confederation which governed 
the united states before the constitution was ratified prevented 
new york or any other state from enacting the treaties 
but the 2nd us circuit court of appeals found that the articles 
did give the states the power to purchase indian land within their 
borders and extinguish indian title to such land so long as such 
activity did not interfere with congress paramount powers of war 
and peace with the indians 
arlinda locklear a lawyer representing about 13000 oneidas in 
new york wisconsin and canada called the ruling legally wrong 
and morally wrong she said she expected to seek either a 
rehearing by the 2nd circuit or to petition the us supreme court 
for a hearing 
the defendants included the state of new york various state 
agencies and two companies with operations in the area st regis 
paper co and georgia pacific corp 
ray halbritter one of two federally recognized representatives 
of the oneidas in new york said that although the tribe lost in the 
lower courts before where we have won is at the supreme court 
level 
im just hoping that this will not force us into more 
litigation he said from cambridge mass where he is a law 
student 
the oneidas are still negotiating the claim with the state he 
said 
at issue is a strip of land 50 to 60 miles wide running through 
the heart of new york from ogdensburg on the st lawrence river 
south past binghamton to hales eddy on the pennsylvania line 
the lawsuits were brought in 1978 by the oneida indian nation of 
new york the oneida indian nation of wisconsin and the oneida of 
the thames band of ontario canada 
they later were joined by four of the other tribes that make up 
the six nations of the iroquois the onondagas the mohawks the 
senecas and the tuscaroras the cayugas are the sixth nation 
boston lawyer allan vangestel who represented the 12 new york 
counties encompassed by the land claim said the decision is 
expected to end to one of the largest indian land claims in the 
eastern united states and also will have a major impact on future 
indian claims 
essentially the court had to interpret the meaning of the 
articles of confederation and what they said is that the state 
did not have to get permission from the central government he 
said 
circuit judge jon o newman who wrote the 52page opinion 
quoted james madison thomas jefferson and other founding fathers 
he called the case unusual because it requires a federal court 
perhaps for the first time to determine whether actions of a state 
violated the articles of confederation 
the appeals panel also rejected the claim that the land sale was 
barred by a 1784 usiroquois treaty that guaranteed the oneidas 
and tuscaroras who sided with the colonists in the revolution 
possession of the lands on which they are settled

president corazon aquino today shut 
down the countrys largest domestic shipping line which lost one 
ship in a typhoon last week and another last year in one of the 
worlds worst maritime accidents 
transportation secretary reinerio reyes said the indefinite 
suspension of sulpicio lines inc was effective immediately 
the main reason is we want to prevent loss of lives reyes 
said we want to make sure they ships are seaworthy and manned 
by competent crews 
sulpicio operates 22 passenger and cargo vessels that account for 
20 percent of domestic sea traffic among the countrys 7200 islands 
in cebu sulpicio president carlos go said he was unaware of the 
order 
its bad for the public because they have fewer vessels to 
ride go said he declined further comment 
the suspension came one day before sulpicio officials were to 
appear before the maritime regulatory authority to show cause why 
the company should not be suspended 
a sulpicio passenger ship the dona marilyn sank oct 24 during 
typhoon ruby with about 500 people aboard it was about 300 miles 
southeast of manila 
vicente gambito vice president of sulpicio lines said 161 
passengers and 39 crewmen have been rescued and at least 76 people 
confirmed dead 
last december sulpicios dona paz collided with an oil tanker 
off mindoro island and more than 3000 people were believed to have 
perished 
the accidents led to calls by the manila press and prominent 
politicians for a crackdown on maritime safety regulations 
since sulpicio is beset by these accidents we would like to 
have a closer look at their operations reyes said we want to 
check out their ships and in the interest of the safety of 
passengers i have recommended to the president to suspend 
indefinitely their passenger liners 
the president agreed that this was the right step to take he 
added reyes said the order was not expected to disrupt passenger 
service because other companies operate similar routes 
earlier today the transportation department issued orders 
holding four sulpicio ships in port pending an inspection of their 
communications equipment 
reyes said investigators would inspect sulpicios fleet for 
seaworthiness and to make sure they had proper equipment 
he said if widespread deficiencies were found it could result 
in the permanent removal of sulpicios operating franchise 
meanwhile in cebu the coast guard said the search for more 
survivors was suspended today because a tropical depression was 
threatening the area 
last week jose luis alcuaz chief of the national 
telecommunications authority told a senate committee that the dona 
marilyn sailed through rough seas for nearly six hours before 
changing course in a failed attempt to escape the storm 
we will have to find out why of the 13 ships which sailed only 
the dona marilyn sank and 12 others diverted their route reyes 
said 
the dona marilyns skipper is among the missing

in an apparent move to cut economic ties with 
pretorias white minority government four japanese utilities say 
they will not renew contracts to import uranium from south africa 
and its territory southwest africa 
the four regional utilities named in news reports as having 
decided not to renew longterm contracts are tohoku electric power 
co kansai electric power co chubu electric power co and kyushu 
electric power co the kansai utility refused comment today but the 
others confirmed the change 
the four utilities own 16 of the 35 nuclear reactors operating in 
japan and have seven more under construction or planned japan gets 
about 29 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants 
japan has been embarrassed by its emergence as south africas 
biggest trading partner while others among its western allies have 
reduced commercial links in a drive against south africas apartheid 
policy of racial separation 
the japanese government has said it is monitoring such trade an 
implicit warning of possible sanctions against companies that 
increase trade with south africa 
in 1986 the government urged utilities to refrain from entering 
new contracts with south africa said nobuo tanaka director for 
international nuclear energy affairs in the ministry of 
international trade and industry 
since then no new contracts have been made and we understand 
that our utilities will not go into any new contract with south 
african mines the official said in a telephone interview today 
with the associated press 
tokyo electric power co the worlds largest private utility 
says it has sought assurances from the britishbased supplier rtz 
or rio tintozinc corp that it will not receive uranium from 
southwest africa which is also known as namibia 
tanaka said the situation regarding southwest africa which 
pretoria governs in defiance of a united nations resolution is more 
complicated because of the circuitous route uranium follows as it is 
processed in several stages to be usable in nuclear reactors 
rtzsupplied uranium may come from namibia or other sources he 
said but it goes through a conversion process in britain and then 
is enriched in the united states by the us department of energy 
before it reaches japan 
the japanese government position is that there is no way to 
identify the country of origin of such uranium said tanaka 
but he said japan wanted to comply with a un decree restricting 
economic support of south africas administration of namibia the 
utilities of course know such a decree is there they also have been 
respecting this decree tanaka said 
they are cautious entering into new contracts he added 
spokesman yasuho takaya of the tohuku utility said his company 
was not renewing contracts with rtz that end this year and those 
with the south african supplier that end next year 
we have the same position as the japanese government takaya 
said we dont like apartheid 
he said the tohoku utility obtains 10 percent of its uranium from 
south africa and 10 percent from rtz through britain its major 
sources are 60 percent from canada and 20 percent from niger the 
company has ample stocks to draw on he said 
tokyo electric power co which has 11 operating reactors said 
it has never received south african uranium but was concerned about 
the origin of uranium supplied by rtz

a 15yearold cerebral palsy victim who 
set fire to his home in a suicide attempt was charged with arson and 
firstdegree murder in the blaze which killed two of his brothers 
officials said 
the maryland state fire marshals office and howard county police 
charged jacob s clemons of ellicott city as an adult in sundays 
fire which killed 6yearold james clemons and 8yearold michael 
clemons 
if convicted the ninthgrader could be sentenced to life 
imprisonment on the two murder counts a prosecutor said an arson 
conviction is punishable by up to 30 years in prison 
county district judge james vaughan on tuesday ordered jacob sent 
to springfield hospital center in sykesville for an emergency 
evaluation to determine if he may be a danger to himself or others 
in court records police said jacob admitted setting fire to the 
house in this baltimore suburb with reckless and wanton disregard 
of the consequences 
investigators said they believed he set fire to his mattress in a 
suicide attempt then had second thoughts and tried to put out the 
blaze 
a county police spokesman said authorities were reluctant to 
press charges against jacob because of his medical condition the 
fact that he is under psychiatric care and out of consideration for 
the family but felt they had to 
two people died in a fire that was deliberately set said 
sgt angus park in pure legalistic terms thats murder 
public defender carol hanson who is representing jacob asked 
that her client not be incarcerated at the county jail 
at this time it is in his best interests to be in a hospital 
under the care of a physician and psychologist she said 
investigators said they hoped to obtain more information about 
jacobs mental state from interviews 
but vaughan acting at hansons request issued a protective 
order prohibiting police and prosecutors from interviewing him about 
the fire 
no family member was present at the court proceedings 
jacob kept his head bowed during a brief initial hearing before 
district court commissioner walter f closson who ordered him held 
without bond because of the firstdegree murder charges 
authorities then arranged a bond review hearing before vaughan to 
avoid sending the youth to the jail 
bob thomas a spokesman for the state fire marshals office said 
the case probably would go before a county grand jury in the next 
few weeks 
the attempted suicide is something we are looking into we 
cannot comment at this point as to the certainty of that thomas 
said 
after the fire began the boy rushed to awaken his 28yearold 
brotherinlaw officials said they and four others survived the 
fire which occurred while the boys parents david and sally 
clemons were on vacation with several other of their children 
the teenager is one of 15 adopted children and one biological 
child raised by the clemonses many have disabilities or are 
foreignborn 
the two who died of smoke and soot inhalation tried to escape 
through a sliding glass door but were unable to open it 
authorities said

former prime minister menachem begin broke his 
customary silence today to proclaim the party he once headed the 
victor in israels parliamentary elections 
the results are clear labor failed in these results likud 
bloc is in the first place said begin who has lived as a 
recluse since quitting the premiership without explanation in 1983 
begin 75 shared the 1978 nobel peace prize with egyptian 
president anwar sadat for their roles in the camp david accords 
on israels armed forces radio today begin said he planned to 
telephone prime minister yitzhak shamir the likud leader to 
congratulate him 
from his shamirs point of view and the point of view of 
likud this election is an achievement he said begin also said 
he was sorry he was unable to vote in the election but he did not 
elaborate 
the former premier said the leftleaning labor party likuds 
main rival was the big loser in the elections because it lost six 
parliament seats to rightwing parties 
likud won 39 seates in the 120member parliament while labor won 
38 the results for both parties were down from the last election in 
1984 when labor won 44 seats and likud took 41 
four small religious parties captured 18 seats giving them a 
great deal of bargaining power in negotiations to form a coalition 
government with labor and likud 
begin conceded that because likud failed to win a clear majority 
the party faced prolonged and difficult negotiations to form a 
government but lets see what sort of government we will have in 
time as i said it ended positively

the university of kansas basketball team 
has been barred from defending its national basketball championship 
because of recruiting violations 
the threeyear ncaa probation issued tuesday resulted from 
violations that occurred under former coach larry brown who has 
since left kansas for the san antonio spurs of the national 
basketball association the national collegiate athletic association 
said 
current kansas basketball coach roy williams said he is angry 
about the probation but that his team will adapt 
the probation which bars postseason play in the first year 
could be extended with even stiffer penalties should kansas commit 
further violations within the three years 
the school also must disassociate itself from backers that brown 
identified as jerry collins formerly in broadcast production for ku 
and now in a similar role for the san antonio spurs ralph light 
president of ral construction of kansas city and mike marshall a 
former ku player who worked in browns basketball camp during 1986 
the team also cannot bring recruits on paid trips to the campus 
for a year and the school will be stripped of one scholarship 
during that period 
brown said the penalties resulted largely from improper 
recruiting inducements given to onetime transfer student vincent 
askew during a 10day period in 1986 brown collins light and 
marshall were responsible for the inducements which included 
airline tickets to and from kansas brown said tuesday 
im just sorry it happened collins said light would not 
comment marshall could not be reached for comment nor could askew

the countrys military chief today 
expressed anger at charges thai officers stole 35 million in 
covert us aid for cambodian guerrillas and said us officials 
must name the culprits 
gen chavailit yongchaiyudh told reporters at supreme command 
headquarters that he had no knowledge of any alleged corruption he 
said the charges first reported in the washington post sunday have 
hurt morale in the army 
the washington post must reveal more details to back those 
allegations because it is irresponsible to talk lightly of something 
as accusatory as this he said that or go to hell 
chavalit said he has ordered an investigation but added that he 
doubted anything could be proven because he said the americans 
handle the financial administration of the aid program 
if any us official can identify the culprits come tell us 
he said but if he knows but wont come forth then we cannot work 
well together and cannot call ourselves friends 
other thai officers have denied there was any corruption 
the program is operated by cia officers in thailand which the 
guerrillas use as sanctuary and support in fighting vietnamese 
troops that invaded cambodia in late 1978 the money is funneled to 
the guerrillas at least in part through the thai military 
the aid in the form of nonlethal items and training goes to 
the forces of prince norodom sihanouk and former prime minister son 
sann and is intended to strengthen their position relative to the 
third guerrilla group the communist khmer rouge the latter group 
killed hundreds of thousands in cambodia before vietnam invaded 
the aid program has since been cleaned up but is operating at 
reduced levels us officials in washington say 
the washington post report said cia officers in thailand first 
turned up evidence earlier this year that money had been skimmed off 
from the program which totaled 12 million in fiscal 1988 an audit 
team dispatched to thailand by the senate intelligence committee 
confirmed the scheme 
the teams report to the intelligence panel on july 12 sparked 
disagreement over whether the covert support should be continued 
the post reported 
at the time the united states was seeking to increase the aid 
program 
it was decided to reduce the amount of us support to 8 million 
in the current year and to institute strict accounting procedures

election today less than three months after the western pacific 
archipelagos president committed suicide and three years after his 
predecessor was assassinated

arabs reacted with disappointed today to the 
results of israels general election as some agreed with king 
hussein that a victory by prime minister yitzhak shamir is a setback 
for middle east peace prospects 
foreign minister taher masri of jordan whose country shares 
israels longest border predicted shamirs likud bloc would form a 
coalition government within days with several small ultraorthodox 
religious parties 
we think such a government will be a blow to the efforts of 
peace especially at this time when everyone the two superpowers 
the world at large is becoming more flexible about reaching the 
basis for a peaceful settlement masri told the associated press 
but egyptian minister of state for foreign affairs butros ghali 
told reporters egypt will do business with any new government in 
israel in order to achieve a peaceful settlement of the 
palestinian problem on the basis of implementing the principle of 
selfdetermination 
egypt the only arab country to sign a peace treaty with israel 
has worked with jordan on ways to reach a broader settlement both 
hinted before the election that they favored a victory by shamirs 
rival foreign minister shimon peres of the labor party 
foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid of egypt said in a statement 
egypt is anxious to emphasize the need for action to carry on 
with the peace process to achieve stability in the region for its 
part egypt will make every effort to this end and hopes the new 
israeli government will do likewise 
hussein told the abc television network on oct 20 that a shamir 
victory would be an absolute disaster 
shamir opposes arab demands for a unsponsored arabisraeli 
peace conference and for israels withdrawal from arab lands 
captured in 1967 
palestine liberation organization executive committee member 
mohammed milhem said the israeli vote showed the society in israel 
is not for peace 
it seems that in israel and for a long time to come there 
will be no chance for peace no chance for a government that 
advocates peace said milhem the elected mayor of the west bank 
town of halhoul who was deported by the israelis in 1980 
milhem expressed skepticism about both major parties but said 
with shamir there may be more chances for peaceful settlement 
than with peres hes going to escalate hes going to kill more 
people deport more people 
the war is going on and it will be going on innocent lives 
on both sides will have to be sacrificed he said its because 
the israeli rulers have chosen this line 
wahid jabari who represented the west bank city of hebron in 
jordans parliament stayed up late into the night listening to 
israel rradio for news of the voting 
i was expecting success for likud jabari said the israeli 
extremists are more numerous than those who want peace 
assad abdulrahman a political scientist on the plos central 
committee said a likud victory would be better than a continuation 
of the likudlabor coalition of the past four years 
a relatively weak likudled government will increase 
polarization within israeli society he said 
ismael makiyeh a grocery store owner in amman who fled palestine 
before israel was created in 1948 said it would be a disaster 
having shamir serve another term im very pessimistic there isnt 
going to be peace in this part of the world having a stubborn 
neighbor like that around

the state government has been overdrawn at the bank 
of boston by as much as 190 million as state tax collections fell 
below projections for october dukakis administration officials said 
the disclosures tuesday coming one week before the presidential 
election were considered damaging to the reputation for fiscal 
management cultivated by gov michael dukakis as he wages his 
underdog campaign for the white house 
the admissions also gave to new fuel to angry republicans in the 
legislature who have called for an investigation of the states cash 
management practices 
at a news conference secretary of administration and finance 
frank keefe tried to reassure reporters about the states underlying 
economic strength 
we face a fiscal challenge not a fiscal crisis keefe said 
citing the states low unemployment rate and high rate of personal 
income growth when you have the no 1 economy in the country you 
dont have a fiscal crisis your economy will see you through 
a shortage of tax collections has forced the state to tap 
shortterm borrowing for 12 billion at a cost of nearly 10 
million since the fiscal year began on july 1 keefe said 
in addition keefe confirmed accusations by republicans that the 
state was overdrawing its principal bank account at the bank of 
boston 
there is nothing illegal about it i want to make that clear 
said patrick sullivan the deputy state treasurer at the statehouse 
news conference we have this agreement with the bank of boston 
weve had it for years 
sullivan said the longest period of continuous overdrafts was 30 
days ending tuesday and that the peak overdraft was 190 million he 
said he could not say how much the state paid in penalties 
under state law keefe sets fiscal policy on behalf of the 
administration treasurer robert q crane an independently elected 
official handles daytoday cash management including borrowing 
paying bills and investing free cash 
keefe and sullivan said the state actually has some 430 million 
in cash or cash equivalents on hand in other accounts but they 
said the treasurer elected to run an overdraft at the bank of 
boston rather than tap those accounts because the cash deposits were 
earning higher rates of interest than the potential penalties on an 
overdraft 
critics said the announcement that tax collections were lower 
than expected was evidence that dukakis will not be able to balance 
the state 116 billion budget without deep spending cuts or a tax 
increase 
theres one purpose to all this to mask the fiscal crisis 
until after the election said state sen paul cellucci a state 
cochairman of the republican presidential campaign

soviet activist andrei d sakharov lashed out at mikhail s 
gorbachevs plan for political reform saying it was a time bomb 
that would give the soviet leader a dangerous monopoly of power 
published reports said 
sakharov the soviet unions most prominent human rights 
advocate on tuesday strongly criticized parts of gorbachevs 
proposals as a return to centralization that could augur a new age 
of stalinism 
a head of state with such powers in a country that does not 
have a multiparty system is just insanity this is practically 
boundless power he said today it is gorbachev but tomorrow it 
could be somebody else there are no guarantees that some stalinist 
will not succeed him 
the nobel peace prizewinning physicist made the comments to 
reporters from the new york times and the washington post during a 
conference with soviet and us scholars in moscow 
sakharov who has been a strong supporter of gorbachev since the 
soviet leader ordered him released from internal exile nearly two 
years ago added his voice to growing criticism of the proposed 
system from soviet intellectuals 
while the newly published draft election laws and constitutional 
amendments have been promoted as a move toward greater democracy he 
said they are actually a time bomb that would create a national 
leader vested with absolute power 
once more everything boils down to one person and that is 
extremely dangerous for perestroika he said referring to 
gorbachevs plan for restructuring the soviet economy this is an 
extremely important question on which the fate of our country 
depends 
the proposed new electoral system approved at a communist party 
conference in july calls for the election of a new congress of 
peoples deputies which in turn will pick a new legislature and 
president critics contend the congress and thus the legislature 
could be manipulated by party functionaries and the president would 
have extraordinary powers to issue decrees 
this is perestroika from above said sakharov it can only 
develop further with real democratic foundations without them 
reform is at a dead end 
while shift of power to a legislature is essential he said 
these changes will determine our life for a very long time before 
you cut your clothes you must take at least seven different 
measurements surely we need at least three months for this 
discussion 
the new laws are scheduled to be approved by a special session of 
the soviet legislature on nov 29

dentists arent pleased with plans for 
a giant molar sculpture intended to commemorate the first city to 
fluoridate its drinking water saying the statue would send the 
wrong signals about dentistry 
fluoride is probably the single most significant healing effort 
in dentistry and an extracted tooth represents just the opposite 
feelings of pain or suffering or anxiety said dr charles 
caldwell president of the 400member west michigan dental society 
artist mark heckman 26 said he learned recently that his 
hometown made history in 1945 by being the first to add fluoride to 
its water but was shocked there was nothing to commemorate the 
event 
i wanted to raise all the money myself and give the sculpture 
to the city as a present heckman said tuesday at first 
everybody was telling me what a great idea it was but the dentists 
have stalled the whole thing 
his plan dubbed operation pearly white consists of a 
600pound 18footlong abstract fiberglass sculpture of a tooth 
balanced atop a stainless steel pole 22 feet above the grand river 
downtown 
heckman said he has tried to work with the dental group changing 
his design from a traditionallooking threerooted molar to the 
abstract tooth but to no avail 
i didnt want it to be obvious that it was a tooth but now the 
dentists are sensitive about it looking like a mutant molar it 
makes them cringe heckman said holding his mouth in feigned 
pain i dont think anybody else is going to think about that when 
they look at it 
the steel pole on which the tooth would sit hasnt been a winning 
point either to me that symbolizes the dental instrument said 
heckman whose girlfriend is a dental hygienist 
mayor gerald helmholdt said he likes the design but sympathizes 
with the dentists concerns 
i think it could be unique and certainly most unusual for a 
piece of art the mayor said but i think its important to have 
the dental associations support of a sculpture because theyre so 
closely tied to its purpose 
caldwell said the dental society has formed a committee to design 
a fountain to be dedicated in 1995 the 50th anniversary of the 
fluoridation 
heckman who received receiving a letter of support from former 
president gerald ford a former grand rapids congressman and 
funding commitments for the 55000 tooth has vowed to dedicate his 
sculpture next july 
the decision ultimately will be made by the city commission 
heckman compared his fight to the opposition fluoridation 
proponents faced when the idea was introduced 
fluoride was called a communist plot forced medication or 
worse yet rat poison heckman said those who advocated 
fluoridation had to face tremendous opposition but they didnt give 
up and neither will i

corporate america boosted its productivity in 
the third quarter reversing a loss of efficiency in the second 
quarter that was much greater than economists had previously 
calculated the government said today 
productivity among nonfarm businesses responsibile for 
threefourths of the nations economic activity rose at an annual 
rate of 13 percent from july through september the labor 
department said with a 28 percent increase in output and only a 
15 percent rise in hours worked to achieve it 
in the second quarter productivity dropped by 24 percent the 
first quarterly decline since 1986 earlier calculations had put the 
second quarter efficiency loss at only 14 percent 
the calculation of growth in second quarter output was revised 
from 52 percent to 40 percent 
meanwhile productivity in the manufacturing sector which 
accounts for about onefourth of the nations economic activity 
rose 43 percent in the third quarter on a 65 percent increase the 
biggest this year in output of goods coming off assembly lines 
factories achieved the increased output with an increase of only 
2 percent in hours worked reflecting a leveling off in hiring new 
workers 
the labor department figures showed manufacturing wages and 
benefits rising at an annual rate of 46 percent in the third 
quarter compared with 38 percent over the last year 
but the increased output enabled us factories to maintain labor 
costs at only 03 percent above what they were in the second quarter 
and only 07 higher than they were a year ago compared with a 42 
percent annual inflation rate 
even with the larger pay gains recently the figures show factory 
workers making 03 percent less than they did a year ago for each 
hour of work after taking inflation into account 
businessmen as a whole have not been so successful in keeping a 
lid on their labor costs in the third quarter labor costs among 
nonfarm businesses rose at an annual rate of 4 percent on hourly 
wage and benefit gains averaging 54 percent annually 
over the last year hourly wages and benefits have risen an 
average of 49 percent among nonfarm businesses giving workers in 
the private sector generally a 07 percent increase in their buying 
power after taking inflation into account

sen lloyd bentsen told supporters in 
southern illinois today that vice president george bushs choice of 
dan quayle as his running mate illustrated the real disdain that 
republicans have for the american public 
the democratic vice presidential nominee attacked quayle several 
times for his senate voting record including his opposition to 
requiring employers to give workers 60 days advance notice of plant 
closings or mass layoffs 
the texas senator said bushs selection of quayle for the vice 
presidency showed that the gop nominee would do anything to win the 
nov 8 election 
bush showed a real disdain disregard for our country 
bentsen said 
he was introduced by illinois two democratic senators alan 
dixon and paul simon who said bentsen would win handily if 
republican senators were polled on which vice presidential candidate 
they preferred it would be a washaway simon said 
simon advised the crowd dont believe the polls which show 
bush with a significant lead over democratic rival michael dukakis 
nationwide bentsen has been delivering the same message insisting 
that the democratic ticket is narrowing the gap in the final days of 
the campaign 
from illinois bentsen travels to ohio and west virginia before 
returning to texas in the wrapup of a campaign swing that is taking 
him through six states in three days 
at every stop dukakis running mate compares the democratic 
tickets fate with efforts by harry truman and john kennedy who 
came from behind in the last weeks of the campaign and won 
today the polls are closing the momentum is our way he 
told a rally attended by about 2000 students tuesday night at 
washington university in st louis 
the republicans think the campaign is over and are popping 
those campaign corks but ill tell you on november ninth theyre 
going to have the worst hangover theyve ever had he said 
as he has been doing at other stops bentsen held over his head a 
reprint of the 1948 chicago tribune which declared wrongly dewey 
defeats truman 
mike mccurry bentsens press secretary said the message would 
remain simple through the final days of the campaign bentsen will 
talk about how the republicans have distorted michael dukakis 
record through negative campaigning and he will continue to attack 
dan quayle george bushs running mate 
those two issues are weighing heavily on the minds of voters 
who are reconsidering their initial choice of bush as their 
candidate mccurry said 
bentsen in his speeches cites polls selectively to highlight 
those which show the democratic campaign gaining ground on the 
republican ticket 
mccurry asked about new national polls sponsored by news 
organizations showing doubledigit leads for bush said we dont 
necessarily think those are accurate they are not consistent with 
the campaigns own polls he said 
tuesday evening in owensboro ky bentsen addressed a huge crowd 
of more than 2500 people in a tobacco warehouse to that crowd of 
conservative democrats he said the republican assertion that 
dukakis was weak on defense was nonsense 
he told them the democrats support a military that is best in the 
world 
ill tell you what a secondbest defense system is he said 
it has all the value of a secondbest poker hand all it does is 
cost you money

michael dukakis invoked the memories of other 
underdog democratic presidential candidates today and urged 
supporters to keep pouring it on in the closing days of the 1988 
campaign 
this is one election where millions of people are going to be 
looking and thinking and listening and theyre not going to be 
making up their mind until very close to the moment when they go 
into that polling booth he told a rally in a downtown hotel 
dukakis then went to the university of minnesota hospital where 
his wife kitty is recovering from a respiratory viral infection 
he took an unscheduled detour from kansas city mo to minnesota 
late tuesday for a postmidnight visit with his wife 
the democratic nominee visited his wife for 40 minutes after this 
mornings rally and together they waved to reporters from her 
sixthfloor hospital window downstairs dukakis said she was a 
good deal better but that shes got to take it easy one day at 
a time 
joining dukakis at the rally were massachusetts sen edward m 
kennedy and minnesota senate candidate hubert h humphrey iii 
kennedy urged the partisan crowd to do the same thing for the 
governor of massachusetts and skip humphrey that you did for john 
kennedy in 1960 
kennedy also joked about the candidacy of humphrey son of the 
late sen hubert h humphrey 
the only trouble i have with skip humphrey said kennedy 
is he is trying to get along on the basis of a famous family 
name 
dukakis said the presence of kennedy and humphrey on the platform 
reminds us of some very important elections 
he cited harry trumans upset victory in 1948 kennedys close 
win in 1960 and the closing drive of humphrey in 1968 when he nearly 
overtook republican richard nixon 
dukakis urged the crowd to keep pouring it on and pouring it 
on there are millions and millions of voters out there who havent 
made up their mind 
dukakis told reporters at the hospital that his wife seemed to 
be much improved in fighting off a pretty tough virus but 
said it was uncertain whether she would be well enough to return to 
the campaign trail before tuesdays election 
she said she loves me he replied when asked what mrs 
dukakis had said to him 
and what did you say to her 
i love her 
at rallies in ohio wisconsin michigan and missouri large 
crowds cheered dukakis newly refined populist message 
in the crowded gymnasium at penn valley community college in 
kansas city he repeatedly invoked the memory of the states 
favorite son harry truman the hero of all democratic party 
underdogs 
saying he would win by taking his message to the people dukakis 
added that was harry trumans prediction in 1948 and its my 
prediction today 
truman defeated republican thomas e dewey 40 years ago despite 
an overwhelming consensus that he had no chance to win 
he ridiculed president reagans suggestion that if truman a 
highly partisan democrat were alive today he would support bush 
ive got a message for mr bush and he republicans said 
dukakis harry truman stood for the little guy and youre looking 
at him 
the basketball scoreboard in the gymnasium read duke 50 bush 
0 
a large sign said we need a president and a vice president 
not a vice president and an idiot 
dukakis reminded crowds at every stop that there were only seven 
days remaining until election day 
give it everything you have everything you have over the next 
seven days he urged his supporters 
two new national polls had no good news for dukakis 
a cbsnew york times survey said bush was leading by a margin of 
53 to 41 percent while an abcwashington post poll put the bush 
lead at 55 to 42 percent the polls had margins of error of plus or 
minus three and four percentage points respectively 
senior political adviser kirk odonnell said dukakis own polls 
put bush ahead by seven points and insisted with campaign chairman 
paul brountas were closing in 
national polls no longer have that kind of significance said 
brountas 
were looking at the battleground states he said were 
making progress in those states

fourteen black legislators including 
state naacp president thomas reed went on trial today on 
misdemeanor trespass charges for trying to remove the confederate 
battle flag atop alabamas capitol 
district judge craig miller who is presiding over the nonjury 
trial agreed to let tv cameras record the proceedings 
miller earlier rejected defense claims that the lawmakers were 
protected by legislative immunity when they made a mostly symbolic 
bid on feb 2 the opening day of the 1988 legislative session to 
bring down the flag 
the offense carries a penalty of up to three months in jail and a 
500 fine 
reed 60 the senior black in the legislature in 1970 became one 
of the first two blacks this century to win a seat in the assembly 
he was convicted last month on federal extortion charges in an 
unrelated case and a court ordered his removal upon sentencing no 
sentencing date has been set 
reed claims the extortion case was built against him because of 
his threat to pull down the confederate flag if republican gov guy 
hunt failed to do it before the opening day of the 1988 legislative 
session 
hunt said he viewed the flag as a historic emblem and refused to 
remove it unless instructed to do so by the legislature on feb 2 
a resolution to remove the rebel standard failed to win passage 
the 14 legislators walked to a chainlink fence surrounding the 
capitol which is now closed for restoration and renovations where 
they were stopped by state troopers and capitol police who declined 
to let them enter 
reed grabbed the fence as if to climb it and was arrested one 
by one the other blacks grabbed the fence and were arrested as well 
former gov john patterson said the confederate flag was raised 
over the capitol in 1961 to coincide with the civil war centennial 
the flag was still atop the dome when george c wallace became 
governor in 1963 with the pledge of segregation forever and the 
never came down 
defendants in district court trials if convicted have the right 
to request a fullscale jury trial at the circuit court level

of the vice president in ohio one of the battlegrounds he said 
voters should reject farout liberalism when they cast their 
ballots 
new polls released a week from election day showed the republican 
presidential nominee still leading solidly 
a cbs news poll conducted saturday through monday showed bush 
ahead by 12 percentage points 5341 percent virtually the same as 
the 13point lead a cbs poll had shown a week ago 
but fully one voter in five said he could still change his mind 
before election day the survey was of 1066 probable voters and had 
a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points 
an abc newswashington post poll done wednesday through monday 
gave the gop nominee a 13point lead over dukakis 5542 percent 
the survey of 1099 probable voters had a margin of error of four 
percentage points 
an abc news poll in california showed bush the leader by seven 
percentage points in the nations largest state and another survey 
by the network indicated a close race in illinois with bush leading 
4847 statistically meaningless in light of the polls fivepoint 
margin of potential sampling error 
dukakis aides contended their own private polls showed the 
democratic presidential nominee gaining on his republican rival in 
battleground states privately some democrats expressed doubts 
the democratic nominee was campaigning today in minneapolis 
chicago pittsburgh and philadelphia where he was joining former 
democratic candidate jesse jackson at rally at a local high school 
dukakis appealed to black voters tuesday night at detroits 
greater grace temple where he said the republicans have ignored the 
needs of inner cities and are insensitive to the plight of 
minorities dukakis was joined by rosa parks whose refusal to move 
to the back of a montgomery ala bus was a milestone of the civil 
rights movement 
bush spoke to an evening rally in waukesha wis where he took a 
line directly from dukakis new populist campaign theme 
i am on your side bush declared you are on my side 
but in nevada reagan was mocking dukakis for that same line 
the liberals now are saying that theyre on your side reagan 
said i guess they think that that will make it easier for them to 
reach their hand around and put it in your pocket 
while dukakis kept a frenetic campaign pace bush was just the 
opposite he campaigned enough to avoid seeming too confident but 
was serene enough to deliver an abovethefray address on 
presidential concerns 
bush went to the university of notre dame in south bend ind 
where he pledged to appoint moderate persons of conservative 
views to the supreme court he said dukakis would appoint 
doctrinaire liberals 
bush also said he would seek an early meeting with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev to allow them to size each other up 
correctly 
bushs running mate dan quayle was to campaign in south bend but 
saw his schedule abruptly changed by the bush campaign headquarters 
he voiced irritation but campaigned elsewhere in his native state 
democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen campaigned in 
kentucky where he spoke to a crowd in a tobacco warehouse and said 
the democrats are committed to having the best military in the world

republican george bush beginning a determined 
push to get out the vote urged people today to look beyond the 
charges get past the shouting and choose as president the person 
who represents your values 
before a screaming crowd of mostly young people who filled the 
adlai stevenson high school gymnasium bush declared i am that 
man 
with only six days remaining before americans choose a new 
president bush hit the campaign trail with a plea for gop turnout 
do not forget your solemn obligation to vote bush told the 
crowd many of whom were too young to vote 
the high school rally was the first stop before bush headed to 
grand rapids and lansing mich and then a trip to columbus ohio 
for an overnight stop reflecting the closeness of the race in 
illinois with its 24 electoral votes bush will return to the 
chicago area again thursday for another appearance 
i come before you at the end of a long long journey bush 
said at the high school in just a few days from now many of you 
in this room will help select the next president of the united 
states and i ask for your vote 
youre not going to make your decision on some television 
advertisement or some sound bite and what i want you to do is 
look beyond the charges get past the shouting and choose as 
president the person who represents your values your dreams your 
hopes for the united states and i am that man 
expressing optimism about the outcome of the race bush said i 
think things are moving in our direction but quickly added his 
standard disclaimer that im going to keep on running as though 
im 10 points behind 
on tuesday bush indicated he would seek an early summit with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev to explore possibilities for 
deeper arms cuts and solutions for other superpower problems 
the oval office requires an unflashy common sense and i will 
try to bring that kind of common sense to the oval office bush 
told an audience of 2000 people at the university of notre dame 
two nationwide polls released tuesday night indicated that bushs 
backing extends far and wide the vice president held doubledigit 
leads of 12 and 13 points in the two surveys 
bush during an impromptu stop tuesday night at a polish dinner 
expressed eagerness for the campaign to end 
ill sure be glad bush told a crowd of hundreds of people 
that six days is going slow its like a caterpillar crawling 
across the plate 
in sharp contrast to his frequent declarations that hes running 
as if he were 10 points behind bush began talking about how he 
would run the white house 
i dont know what the cutting moments will be for the next 
president but i know theyll come and i know im ready bush said 
im no mystic he added and my leadership might not be the 
most charismatic but im not sure we need a lot of razzle dazzle 
theres probably enough drama in the world today 
but ill try to be fair ill try to be wise and ill listen 
bush said 
for the first time bush said that as president he would be 
prepared to meet with gorbachev so they could size each other up 
correctly 
bush said he would be ready to meet the soviet leader at the 
earliest time that would serve the interests of world peace 
and my purpose in such a meeting would not be to achieve any 
grand breakthrough but to engage in a serioius and direct 
examination of where we are and how we can best go forward toward 
further arms reductions a decrease in regional tensions and further 
adherence to human rights and thus toward a surer peace 
on another subject bush said the next president likely will have 
a high number of seats to fill on the supreme court 
i will appoint moderate persons of conservative views i 
believe my opponent would appoint doctrinaire liberals he said 
the excessive judicial activism of the 60s and 70s is one 
reason americans turned against that kind of liberalism by the 
80s bush said 
several dozen protesters shouted antibush messages and one 
heckler stood up and screamed lies lies 
bush pausing in his speech said theres always some guy who 
jumps up at these rallies and says the same thing so dont let it 
bother you 
bush scorned michael dukakis reputation for dwelling on details 
saying i think hes guided more by abstract theories and grids 
and graphs and computer printouts and the history of swedish social 
planning rather than old fashioned common sense 
the vice president also took issue with dukakis identification 
with the liberal tradition of former presidents franklin roosevelt 
harry truman and john f kennedy 
i have had some programmatic differences but i respect the 
tradition of harry truman and fdr a liberalism that was committed 
abroad and concerned at home a liberalism that spoke for some good 
things like civil rights bush said but some of todays 
liberals do not see as clearly as their forefathers

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout 
the nation 
nov 1 
the flint mich journal on saving the whales in alaska 
was it worth spending 13 million trying to save the three now 
two wayward whales that were trapped in a prison of ice near point 
barrow alaska 
ask any child who fell in love with the california grays or any 
champion of the underdog who watched the heroic efforts for three 
weeks and theyll probably respond with a resounding emotional 
yes 
others persuasively argue the event was nothing more than 
frenzied arctic madness fueled by international media hype and to a 
lesser extent guilt over what mankind has done to enhance chances 
of whale extinction 
they claim the effort endangered the lives of many people who 
flocked to the whales without arctic survival training and really 
did little to preserve the species these whales which were not 
the first nor will they be the last to become trapped in alaskan 
ice may yet die before reaching the warm waters of mexicos west 
coast 
a more important question why do we exert such valiant efforts 
for such creatures while we ignore or turn our backs on fellow human 
beings all around us trapped in the brutally icy confines of 
violence poverty hunger homelessness loneliness illness and 
hopelessness

st louis postdispatch on leveraged buyouts 
whats wrong with leveraged buyouts in principle nothing in 
practice plenty 
when rjr nabiscos management proposed last month to purchase all 
the companys outstanding stock it planned to incur nearly 20 
billion in debt a sum so great the companys future may be 
impaired but since it isnt public money why should the public 
care 
because when many large companies overload themselves with debt 
they diminish their ability to improve their productivity reduce 
their competitiveness abroad even jeopardize their very survival 
should a recession occur 
and low productivity not to mention major bankruptcies by large 
companies imperil the economys health and stability 
it may pay management to take a company private indeed it 
usually does in the short run having a personal financial stake in 
a major enterprise in a profitable year can make the difference 
between earning a substantial salary and a major fortune 
but the large economy is put at risk to the extent that the 
current tax code encourages debt and it does it should be 
changed a soon as possible

the one word that america did not hear at the democratic national 
convention in atlanta the one word that makes democratic 
professional politicians shudder 
liberal the l word 
we think its time liberals came out of the closet 
imagine what the late hubert h humphrey would have done with the 
liberal label the happy warrior would have made it his 
badge of honor rather than a label of shame 
there have been many great liberal ideologists men and women who 
have worked for great and good change in society its too bad the

the bremerton wash sun on the federal deficit 
members of the 100th congress have scurried home to campaign in a 
selfcongratulatory mood with bipartisanship strong leadership and 
a new assertiveness congress has done much to undo the excesses of 
the reagan years 
but congress and reagan have one thing in common both tapdanced 
past their gravest responsibility deficit reduction 
congress allowed the deficit crisis to worsen and the 
grammrudman deficit plan to weaken the havoc that will follow if 
congress slowly strangles grammrudman will dwarf its other 
accomplishments 
grammrudman is now little more than a bookkeeping dodge the 
1985 bill mandated progressive deficit reductions until 1991 when 
the budget was supposed to balance 
congress moved that date back to 1993 and it raised the 1988 
deficit limit from 108 billion to 146 billion 
cynics said from the beginning grammrudman was more a gesture 
than a solution congress should repeal the bill rather than engage 
in this sort of charade 
for all its new boldness though congress wont do that it has 
perfected a new maneuver the deficit dodge

the miami herald on hate groups 
white supremacists neonazis antisemites and any others 
dedicated to demonstrating their bigotry should be on notice 
violate the rights of those whom you love to hate and youll be hit 
where it hurts in the wallet 
thats the message that a federal court jury wisely sent last 
week when it ruled that two whitesupremacist groups must pay nearly 
1 million damages to racism protesters 
the antidefamation league of bnai brith the american civil 
liberties union and other civil rights organizations report 
increases in hate groups and racist violence these laws crafted to 
combat 1860s racism unfortunately still are needed in 1988 
in that light its ironic that the supreme court has voted to 
reconsider its 1976 runyon vs mccrary ruling which permits 
individuals to seek punitive damages for private acts of 
discrimination 
this is no time to diminish what is often the last bastion of 
legal hope for victims of irrational hatred

the times trenton nj on presidential projections on tv 
hours before the polls close the tv networks will declare a 
winner in the presidential contest based on returns from polling 
places in the east that will cast a whatstheuse pall over those 
who havent yet voted 
the networks are constantly refining their sampling techniques 
and some analysts think this years election night will bring 
even quicker news of the winner which will make things even worse 
out west 
some states have tried to restrict exit polling a major 
datagathering technique but federal judges have struck these laws 
down on constitutional grounds 
the most practical solution would be to apply a uniform 
nationwide pollclosing time 
two months ago the senate rules committee approved a bill that 
would close polls at 10 pm est 7 pm pst beginning with the 
1992 election the house passed a similar measure in 1987 but the 
legislation died with congress adjourment 
therell be time to revive it before the next election perhaps 
the spectacle on nov 8 will spur the next congress to do the 
job quickly

the knoxville tenn newssentinel on political appointees 
a commission of washington experts has come up with a new way to 
thwart the democratic process 
headed by former federal reserve chairman paul volcker the 
national commission on public service proposes that president 
reagans successor reduce the number of political appointees in the 
federal bureaucracy 
from cabinet members downward the total number of such 
appointees is slightly more than 5000 roughly twotenths of 1 
percent of the entire federal work force 
all too often this tiny beachhead is engulfed by tenured civil 
servants whose first priority is to protect their own programs and 
careers 
the washington establishment has ways to guard the status quo 
that the framers of the constitution never imagined such as a 
congress in virtually yearround session and tens of thousands of 
specialized lobbyists and legislative staffers who almost always 
want to enlarge existing programs not shrink them 
this permanent government hardly needs more power to screen 
out newcomers loyal to a presidents mandate 
the percentage of political appointees in the federal 
establishment should not be cut it should be doubled

carlsbad nm currentargus on preserving brazilian forests 
brazilian president jose sarney says it was the fact that 6000 
manmade fires were discovered burning in virgin amazon jungle 
during one day that suddenly made him aware of the danger to the 
ecology 
consequently in a policy flipflop that has gratified 
environmentalists the world over sarney has reversed brazils 
20yearold policy of ruthlessly exploiting the vast jungles of the 
amazon valley and the tropical rain forests of the atlantic coast 
the global importance of the great rain forests of brazil is 
difficult to underestimate they constitute a major lung of the 
world manufacturing lifesustaining oxygen and absorbing carbon 
dioxide one of the gases trapping solar heat and contributing to 
the alarming greenhouse effect feared to be raising the earths 
temperature 
the consequences of destroying the worlds remaining tropical 
forests are profound for a human population that demands 
everincreasing amounts of oxygen the whole planet has an interest 
in sarneys heartening promise to preserve the brazilian jungles

bentsen says the republicans are running a miserable campaign dan

any voter seeking enlightenment from what is going on now is out 
of luck at this point both national campaigns seem more 
interested in exchanging accusations than exploring issues 
so be it its their campaign to run 
the voters are due one note of caution however about the nature 
of political campaigns nationally and locally 
strange charges seem to surface in the last days before an

the pressenterprise riverside calif on the whistleblower 
veto 
president reagan really had to scrape to come up with an excuse 
to kill a bill that would have provided protection to 
whistleblowers federal employes who report fraud and 
mismanagement 
the bill was approved by the house 4180 and by the senate on 
unanimous voice vote and with good reason federal employees should 
be encouraged to report wrongdoing 
and yet the president has decided to exercise his pocket veto 
by letting the bill die without his signature while congress is not 
in session 
his rationale reagan said the measure would have allowed 
employees who are not genuine whistleblowers to manipulate the 
process to delay or avoid discipline 
one has come to expect that kind of reasoning from ronald reagan 
and from the justice department which urged the president to oppose 
the bill new attorney general dick thornburgh simply 
trumpeted the position taken on the bill by his predecessor edwin 
meese who was anything but a model of good standards 
this incident gives the distinct impression that the reagan 
administrations standard of justice has not benefitted by the new 
stewardship at the justice department

the milwaukee journal on mossy cade playing again with the 
packers 
it says something disturbing about americas infatuation with 
sports that the no 1 question in green bay wis these days is not 
whether mossy cade should play for the packers again but when 
cade is the defensive back recently paroled from prison after 
serving 15 months of a twoyear sentence for sexual assault bad 
enough that the punishment was so light the packers compounded the 
injustice by welcoming back cade to his 250000ayear 
highvisibility job 
the packers first described the cade move as a football decision 
not a public relations decision they were right about that 
then they claimed that state law barred them from discriminating 
against cade because of his criminal conviction 
the packer bosses just dont get it of course they shouldnt 
discriminate cade like any other excon is entitled to work but 
he doesnt have to play 
cade surely can fill a job on the periphery of sports 
that wouldnt put him on television once a week during autumn and 
if as the packers contend they are obligated to take cade back 
thats exactly the kind of role they ought to find for him

nasa officials fearing a delay in the 
shuttle program are seeking to keep the agencys only manufacturer 
of rayon from closing after it suffered big losses stemming from the 
challenger disaster 
nasa said tuesday it was talking to avtex fibersfront royal inc 
to keep the supply of a rayon yarn used in shuttle rocket nozzles in 
production while the air force identified three missiles that could 
be affected 
the company took nasa by surprise when it announced monday that 
it would close the front royal plant on thursday idling 1300 
workers and cutting off the governments only supply of the rayon 
said jerry berg a spokesman at nasas marshall space flight center 
in huntsville ala 
it will jeopardize the space program if we do not figure some 
way to get avtex fibers back on line by spring said jim thomas 
assistant to the solid rocket motor program manager at marshall 
avtex chairman john n gregg said monday that without avtexs 
rayon the shuttle program might be grounded for up to two years 
after one more launch 
but berg said there was enough of the rayon on hand for the 
next several shuttle flights nasa initially said the next 12 
flights through may 1990 would be able to stay on schedule but berg 
revised the statement later in the day 
rocky raab a spokesman for the maker of the shuttle motors 
morton thiokol inc said it was too early to say what impact the 
closing could have 
the fibers manufactured by avtex are woven into a cloth by other 
companies raab said two more layers of contractors that treat it 
to make it resistant to high heat 
thiokol buys the finished product for use in the nozzles of its 
shuttle motors raab said 
john kelly an avtex spokesman in new york said he did not know 
of any talks between avtex based in valley forge pa and the 
government that could keep the plant producing the rayon 
gregg said he lost a large amount of money because of the 
challenger disaster that idled the shuttle program for more than 2 
years 
at andrews air force base md a spokeswoman for air force 
systems command said officials had determined that at least one 
missile system stage one of the small icbm used the rayon 
two other systems the mx intercontinental ballistic missile and 
the titan satellite launcher may also depend on the rayon but 
officials had not determined that for certain by late tuesday maj

soviet officials have agreed to permit the teaching 
of hebrew and to allow soviet jews to participate in the world 
jewish congress an official of the international group said today 
both steps announced by world jewish congress executive director 
elan steinberg following meetings with highlevel soviet officials 
would constitute major changes in how the kremlin has dealt with the 
countrys 18 million jews 
they come in the context of an effort by soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev to eliminate rancorous issues that have historically 
hampered the kremlins relations with the west including in the 
field of human rights 
as part of that effort 1975 nobel peace laureate andrei d 
sakharov is being allowed to travel to the west for the first time 
and the soviets have reportedly agreed to release all political 
prisoners by the end of the year 
edgar bronfman world jewish congress president met for two 
hours today with foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and later 
with konstantin kharchev chairman of the soviet state committee on 
religious affairs steinberg said in a telephone interview 
soviet authorities have now agreed that the soviet jewish 
community can participate in the activities of the world jewish 
congress steinberg said reporting on accords reached during the 
meetings he said the exact form of participation remains to be 
worked out 
the world jewish congress represents jewish groups from 70 
countries whose combined jewish populations total 1112 million 
steinberg said those countries include eastern european allies of 
the soviet union where the local jewish populations have a central 
representative body he said 
soviet jews have no such central body as of now steinberg said 
assessing the agreement reached with the soviets the world 
jewish congress official said we view this as part of a larger 
process of easing tensions between east and west which includes a 
better understanding and relationship with jewish communities of the 
world and with israel 
the soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov made 
general comments about the meeting between bronfman and shevardnadze 
at a government news briefing but provided few specifics on any 
agreements reached 
at the request of edgar bronfman eduard shevardnadze gave 
detailed explanations concerning the real state of affairs in such 
issues as emigration from the ussr including that of jews the 
freedom of worship and of cultural and educational activities 
gerasimov said 
he said he would have details on the talks between bronfman and 
shevardnadze at thursdays news briefing 
the unsanctioned teaching of hebrew was once treated in the 
soviet union as a criminal offense and several jewish activists 
went to prison for giving unauthorized instruction in the language 
they included josef begun who was allowed to emigrate to israel 
this year 
but an agreement signed by the ministry of culture to establish 
the first jewish cultural center in the soviet union in more than 50 
years says the building may be used for classes in hebrew and 
yiddish steinberg said 
a working knowledge of hebrew is considered an essential part of 
the religious instruction given to every jew but soviet laws now on 
the books bar the private teaching of religious subjects to anyone 
under 18 
a new more liberalized law regulating the practice of religion 
in the soviet union is now in the works and is expected to ease 
some of the current constraints on proselytizing and worship 
steinberg said no soviet jew has been jailed recently for the 
unsanctioned teaching of hebrew 
but the cultural ministrys statement of intent in an oct 21 
agreement with australian jewish leaders was the first known 
written commitment by soviet officials to an easing of constraints 
on hebrewlanguage instruction

president reagan campaigned for george bush and 
the republican ticket in the crucial midwest today urging voters to 
reject farout liberalism in the election next tuesday 
speaking at a 150perperson fundraising brunch for senate 
candidate susan engeleiter the president noted her support of the 
death penalty 
reagan said dukakis and the democratic candidate for the senate 
from wisconsin milwaukee bucks owner herbert kohl both say that 
no matter how horrible and brutal the crime theyre opposed to 
capital punishment 
george bush and susan engeleiter believe that for the most 
horrible crimes like when a drug dealer murders a policeman in cold 
blood that kind of killer deserves and should receive the death 
sentence the president said 
reagan noted that mrs engeleiter 36 would be the only mother 
with growing children in the senate if she is elected 
i believe the senate could use a mothers perspective as 
well he said mrs engeleiter is in an uphill struggle against 
kohl for the right to replace retiring sen william proxmire 
i am here today to ask everyone in wisconsin who plans to vote 
for george bush and against farout liberalism in the white house to 
also vote against farout liberalism in the congress the 
president said 
in a speech prepared for delivery later at baldwin wallace 
college in berea ohio the president urged ohio voters to reject 
the reelection bid of liberal sen howard metzenbaum who leads 
clevelands republican mayor george voinovich in public opinion 
polls 
now please dont cancel out your vote for president by picking 
a tax and spend liberal for the senate he said 
the white house announced meanwhile that reagan will extend his 
campaigning through the weekend reagan will visit the chicago area 
and southern new jersey on friday and to macomb county mich and 
the dallas area on saturday 
on tuesday the president campaigned in california and in nevada 
where he sought to bolster the reelection chances of sen chic 
hecht strongly challenged by democratic gov richard bryan 
at an airport rally in reno the president flayed bryan and 
dukakis as taxandspend twins and said i have to tell you 
what a big mistake it would be for nevada to send a jet set 
taxandspend liberal to washington 
bryan depicts himself as independent of the national democratic 
party supports military aid to the nicaraguan rebels and is opposed 
to the equal rights amendment 
the president sought to make a virtue of characteristics for 
which hecht seldom heard in senate debate has been ridiculed by 
his critics 
chic doesnt grab headlines he doesnt showboat reagan said 
chics the kind of senator who doesnt make a lot of noise he 
just gets thing done for his state 
reagan continued to strike out at dukakis for telling audiences 
that he is on your side 
of course the liberals now are saying that theyre on your 
side he said i guess they think that will make it easier for 
them to reach their hand around and put it in your pocket

the pentagon purchased the airlaunched 
cruise missile knowing it did not perform as intended a former 
military official said in an interview published today 
the weapon billed as a lowflying radarevading missile in 
fact was not able to fly low enough to hide from enemy radar 
retired air force lt col ronald f deady told the antelope valley 
press 
deady who now lives in lancaster was a member of the joint 
strategic planning staff at strategic air command headquarters in 
omaha neb from 1974 to 1978 and was among the officials who 
monitored the missiles testing 
the command approved it knowing that it did not fulfill 
operational specifications he said 
an air force spokesman denied the charges saying the missile 
met its stated purpose 
the carter administration had chosen the cruise missile program 
over the b1 bomber to be one of the nations main defense systems 
the missile can be armed with nuclear warheads 
deady whose job at edwards air force base from 1978 to 1981 was 
to ensure the missile was meeting military specifications said he 
found that tests were conducted in a way to make it appear the 
missile worked properly 
for instance he said the missile was launched from b52s flying 
at altitudes that did not fit all operational profiles determined by 
the strategic air command 
in addition the missile was usually tested when the weather was 
conducive for successful flights he said 
deady said he complained to his superiors but got no response 
colleagues advised him against pursuing the matter he said and he 
took their advice and wrote favorable reports thereafter for the 
sake of his career 
the normal methods of delivery did not perform up to 
operational specifications he said but when we turned a report

could 
however deady said he suspects the military in april 1983 
reduced its missile orders from more than 3000 to 1715 because the 
weapon could not adequately evade enemy defenses 
the military has since moved on to another missile system the 
advanced cruise missile military officials denied the decision to 
cancel orders was linked to the missiles performance 
the alcm met its stated purpose said ron fry a spokesman 
for air force logistics command which is responsible for approving 
weapons systems before the service accepts them from contractors 
but because of the new and evolving threat the program was 
redirected in favor of a more advanced weapons system 
airlaunched cruise missiles were delivered to the air force from 
1982 through 1986 fry said the missile now stationed at bases in 
seven states is one of the most reliable weapons in the nations

in a setting hollywood would find 
hard to match the british movie industry threw a party in a palace 
with a princess and some of the greatest names in show business to 
honor the 60th anniversary of the oscar 
the champagne reception tuesday night for 400 guests at hampton 
court palace was in the bedroom where king henry viiis wives slept 
and dinner was served in the ornate great hall that henry was in 
such a rush to finish that he had laborers working on it at night by 
candlelight 
princess anne president of the british academy of film and 
television arts said of the palace it has seen many real life 
dramas that even the film world would find difficult to dramatize 
trade and industry secretary lord young who praised the 
innovation in the american cinema jokingly chided the princess i 
was hoping our american friends could go back thinking this was a 
set specifically built by bafta for them 
two movies the private life of henry viii in 1933 and a 
man for all seasons in 1965 used the exterior of the palace 12 
miles southwest of london as the setting although crews were not 
allowed inside 
they dont allow people to film here at all not 
commercially said ian gray superintendent of the palace 
thats because its a royal palace like windsor or buckingham 
palace and its not considered appropriate to have any commercial 
activities 
the dinner celebrated the close ties between the british and 
american film industries and marked the first time the american 
academy of motion picture arts and sciences has been honored abroad 
said bob rehme an academy vice president 
more than 200 britons have won oscars and about 80 of them 
attended the dinner including actors ben kingsley peter ustinov 
sir john mills and olivia de havilland and directors sir richard 
attenborough david puttnam and david lean 
richard kahn president of the american academy said the 
recognition of british filmmakers in the united states started with 
the first ever oscar awards when charlie chaplin was voted a 
special award and has been nothing short of phenomenal 
this dinner is a fitting capstone to oscars 60th year kahn 
said the luster of oscar is growing its radiance is due in no 
small measure to the oscar laureates in this room tonight 
he presented princess anne with a replica of an oscar to be 
displayed at bafta saying i would like the princess royal to 
adopt this fellow as a loyal son of the realm 
mills one of britains actorknights and winner of the best 
supporting actor award in 1970 for ryans daughter said he was 
somewhat astonished to realize that his 59 yearcareer was just one 
year less than the span of the academy awards 
of all the honors he has received in his career the 80yearold 
mills said of his oscar its the top i think it always has 
tremendous glamour 
ustinov winner of best supporting actor roles for spartacus 
in 1960 and topkapi in 1964 said the british and american film 
industries had always been important to each other 
i think their outlook is sometimes very different and i would 
encourage that difference because its more important than if they 
think the same way ustinov said 
kingsley winner of the best actor award in 1982 for the title 
role in gandhi echoed this saying europe and america 
grafted together the energy of the new world and the craftsmanship 
of the old world which i hope will go on and on and which makes this 
evening very genuine 
asked why so many britons had won oscars kingsley quipped we 
are a talented race but surely it would have to do with british 
actors speaking the same language as the american audience 
olivia de havilland said the american love affair with british 
actors dates back to the 1930s and 1940s when i arrived in 
hollywood all the legendary favorites were british my favorite was 
ronald coleman there was one british artist after another and 
they set the tone 
many of the oscar winners who werent able to attend bob hope 
michael caine julie andrews joan fontaine and others will be 
seen in a british tv documentary titled the british and the 
oscars to be shown in britain on dec 29

the hall was packed with unionlabel democrats 
who cheered themselves hoarse as michael dukakis threw them the kind 
of political rhetoric his partisans have waited to hear 
hard workers not high rollers built this country 
i picked lloyd bentsen loud cheers he picked dan quayle a 
torrent of boos and that tells you everything you want to know 
 
as your president im not going to be standing up for sharp 
operators im going to be standing up for lathe operators and 
machine operators 
theres a lot of talk about labels in this campaign the label 
i care about the label you care about the label the american 
people care about is the label made in america 
at each of these sallies and others people leapt to their feet 
and held their red white and blue signs high above their heads and 
cheered and chanted duke duke duke 
could it be was dull passionless michael dukakis turning on a 
crowd 
indeed he was suddenly in the closing days of the presidential 
campaign the underdog democratic nominee seemed to have discovered 
some magic 
he was in the jargon of politics making contact with his 
audiences 
his words were stronger his phrases sharper after all these 
months dukakis had found his message 
it was a mix of populism and indignation often an effective 
combination for democratic candidates 
with time running out and the national polls still showing 
republican george bush with a steady lead dukakis is drawing big 
crowds and his aides are talking about closing the gap 
this race is tightening up the candidate tells every rally 
you can sense it you can feel it you can taste it 
what dukakis was feeling and tasting at these buoyant events 
could also be merely a phenomenon common in national campaigns call 
it the closing days euphoria 
for the loser as well as the winner the crowds get bigger and 
more enthusiastic 
walter f mondale drew huge crowds in the closing days of the 
1984 campaign and he too detected a surge he predicted would prove 
the pollsters wrong he made that prediction the day before he lost 
49 states 
politicians in eastern washington still recall a massive turnout 
in 1972 for george mcgovern a crowd they now speculate included 
every single person in the state of washington who ended up voting 
for that democratic landslide loser 
dukakis is given a far better chance than anyone ever gave 
mcgovern or mondale to fool the pollsters but an underdog he 
remains 
for months he appeared to be a candidate in search of a message 
a candidate constantly ducking and dodging the attacks of the 
opposition failing to come up with an effective response 
in recent weeks that began to change the populist message 
emerged and he began to make the bush negative commercials a 
campaign issue 
he even took on the dreaded l word 
yes im a liberal in the tradition of franklin roosevelt 
harry truman and john kennedy he told a rally in bakersfield 
calif 
a liberal he is but he obviously remains uncomfortable with the 
tag 
im not a label he kept telling questioners who wanted to 
know why he had so avoided the term earlier and had allowed bush to 
define it in derogatory fashion 
but in the milwaukee exhibition and convention center it all 
seemed to come together 
he was helped by the crowd and also by a series of speakers who 
said many of the things democrats had been wanting to hear from 
their presidential candidate 
there are two candidates how do you decide asked sen 
william proxmire 
you vote for the man on your side he said in response to his 
own question 
after more than 30 years in the senate proxmire is retiring 
having made his mark as a watchdog of government spending the man 
who regularly announced his golden fleece awards to government 
officials departments or agencies he deemed responsible for 
particularly outrageous wastes of public money 
there would be no golden fleeces for a dukakis 
administration said the senator how could i give a golden 
fleece to a man who mows his own lawn

even before he met his friends hurrying 
down the dark icy streets for the start of the 6 am shift 
wednesday at the lenin shipyard piotr gawor knew what the 
governments decision to shut the yard meant 
we are going to be unemployed i dont believe their offer of 
new jobs the 17yearold carpenter said 
like most of the thousands of workers returning to work after a 
fourday holiday gawor only learned he would lose his job when the 
decision to liquidate the shipyard on grounds of economic 
inefficiency was announced on the evening news monday 
the closure due to begin dec 1 has left workers bitter and 
afraid not only for their jobs but for the future of talks between 
authorities and the opposition the talks originally planned for 
midoctober were to consider the future of the banned solidarity 
trade union which was born in the yard in august 1980 
much of the workers anger was directed at mieczyslaw f 
rakowski a longtime foe of solidarity who was named prime minister 
sept 27 after the previous government collapsed over its failure to 
carry out economic reform 
its rakowskis policy he was in the shipyard in 1983 swearing 
at people the round table talks didnt take place and it is all 
thanks to him said krystana burant a crane operator who has 
worked at the yard for 20 years 
the official press said the decision to shut the yard was made by 
rakowski and many workers see the move as rakowskis revenge for a 
1983 meeting at the shipyard where workers booed and whistled at him 
that appearance by rakowski then deputy prime minsiter was to 
defend the authorities 1981 imposition of martial law it has left 
a deep impression on workers who have not forgotten rakowskis 
attempts to humiliate their leader lech walesa 
meeting rakowski for the first time since he was released from 
internment following the dec 13 1981 military crackdown walesa 
was allowed to criticize the government but not permitted to rebut 
rakowskis reply 
we should have just hung rakowski then with his tie hes 
just making a career while we workers suffer said one 
middleaged worker who declined to give his name 
workers say they are not convinced of the governments argument 
that the yard must be closed as part of economic restructuring 
there are so many other enterprises which are more 
unprofitable these still exist and they are closing ours said 
an assembly worker 
some workers grumbled they should just go out on strike in 
protest while others felt the action would play into the hands of a 
government they feel wants to portray solidarity as antireform 
still others thought they could win little now by striking 
i heard there will be a strike in the yard but if there is a 
strike they will just lock us up in jail said barant 
workers do not believe the government will succeed in squelching 
support for solidarity by shutting the yard 
solidarity is like a tree it has its roots here and they 
think that if they cut off the roots solidarity will collapse but 
it is not true said another worker not giving his name 
for the time being solidarity and the official trade union opzz 
have decided to work together to fight the closure in an unusual 
alliance that reverses solidaritys former policy of 
nonfraternization with the opzz the official union federation was 
created to replace solidarity after it was outlawed in 1982 
the government has said that the shipyard workers will have 
30000 jobs in the gdansk area to choose from after the yard is 
closed but some workers still dont believe the yard will shut down 
at all 
its just rumors we worked here and we are going to stay here 
besides i have to stay because otherwise they are going to steal 
everything said a grizzled security guard at the gate as the rest 
of the dispirited crew was walking in to work

the first edition of an independent 
literary and social periodical conceived 10 years ago appeared 
wednesday in budapest under the direction of a writer once out of 
favor with the communist authorities 
the fortnightly hitel which means credit has a print run of 
20000 its editors say it is independent although it has ties to 
the hungarian democratic forum an unofficial movement for democracy 
at a price of about 75 cents it is to be selffinancing leaders 
of the forum have said the journal bears the name credit 
because it hopes to win credit from readers who trust it according 
to editor sando csoori 
csoori an active member of the forum said in his first 
editorial the idea for hitel was born 10 years ago but the 
communist leadership then under janos kadar was suspicious and 
perceived the organizers as representing a 
populistnationalradical trend csoori wrote 
ten years and a quiet change in the power strucuture had to 
pass before we could come out with the first issue of hitel at long 
last csoori wrote 
premier karoly grosz took over from kadar as communist party 
leader in may following a reshuffle that brought reformers into the 
leadership 
in the past year there has been a growth of independent groups 
and movements another independent magazine reform came out for 
the first time in september 
the oncebanned writer istvan csurka was among the contributors 
to the 64page first issue of hitel he wrote about a banned 
demonstration oct 23 to mark the anniversary of the start of the 
1956 anticommunist uprising 
other articles examined constitutional reform national 
selfawareness and a demonstration in september that saw 10000 
people chant calls for democracy and a multiparty system outside 
parliament 
hitel appears in a difficult and inauspicious historical 
moment csoori wrote all hungarian society is in motion so 
drab and gray and undivided for such a long time this is the 
time of moral revision and recovery

the outlawed solidarity trade federation 
today reversed a longstanding policy and agreed to work with the 
governmentapproved union in an effort to save the lenin shipyard 
the announcement was made by lech walesa leader of solidarity 
which was founded at the shipyard he spoke at an outdoor rally 
attended by nearly all the yards 10000 workers on the first 
working day since the government announced monday that it will close 
the shipyard on dec 1 
walesa appeared to rule out a strike for the moment saying 
that would only make the situation worse 
british prime minister margaret thatcher arrived in poland today 
on a threeday visit that will include a trip to a monument outside 
the yard on friday solidarity leaders said they were eager to avoid 
creating a confrontation that could jeopardize the visit the first 
to poland by a british prime minister 
mrs thatchers visit could give government officials a chance to 
justify their hardline treatment of solidarity by pointing to her 
success in subduing unions in britain the government also hopes the 
visit will pave the way for western credits to help the countrys 
debtplagued economy 
walesa said he told the official opzz union that solidarity 
planned to fight to save the shipyard and he proposed the two 
unions suspend their disagreements to work together 
we adopted a common position which is proof the unions can 
reach agreement at any moment provided we are not set against each 
other by someone else walesa said 
the joint resolution marks a reversal of solidaritys earlier 
position not to talk to the official union which was set up in 1982 
after the martiallaw crackdown on solidarity 
although the official union continues to oppose introduction of 
union pluralism saying it alone can best represent all workers 
hostility between the opzz and solidarity has been diminishing on 
the factory floor the two groups have been known to cooperate on 
local issues 
this is for the first time that opzz and solidarity have 
declared cooperation so publicly and so officially although not 100 
percent of unionists are ready to defend the shipyard at any cost 
said franciszek ciemny national spokesman for the opzz 
he said national opzz leaders today endorsed the governments 
motives to reform the economy but decided the shipyard should not 
be closed abruptly 
it asked for a meeting with government officials nov 9 to press 
for improved shipyard efficiency ciemny said 
the shipyard workers have agreed to rally at 9 am every tuesday 
until the closure decision is reversed 
walesa said he believes prime minister mieczyslaw rakowskis 
decision to close the shipyard has ended hopes that proposed talks 
between authorities and the opposition on polands future can begin 
soon 
at this moment it is losing sense he said on the one hand 
you are trying to talk about various subjects and on the other hand 
you close the cradle of solidarity and walesas workplace it 
doesnt make sense 
at the rally management encouraged workers to take up tools and 
work peaceably the thousands of workers who braved icy wind to 
report for 6 am shift appeared willing to follow the advice 
just the way we fight beautifully and sing beautifully we are 
going to work beautifully walesa said i am proud that the 
shipyard is working so nicely 
the government said monday that the shipyard was a moneylosing 
operation and it would be closed the move was viewed widely as a 
slap at solidarity and walesa at a time authorities are ostensibly 
seeking dialogue with the opposition at proposed talks on polands 
future 
official figures show that at least one area shipyard is losing 
more money than the lenin yard the first major industrial 
enterprise the government has announced it will close in a bid to 
revive polands crippled economy 
government spokesman jerzy urban speaking on television tuesday 
said deep economic reforms in poland cannot be made mildly 
and without conflicts 
the government suggested the closure was similar to economic 
actions taken by mrs thatchers conservative party government 
her beginning at the steering wheel was similar inflation 
social tensions outdated uncompetitive industry and stagnation 
state television said but she overcame the crisis often through 
unpopular means against the interests of significant groups 
solidarity was launched at the lenin shipyard during nationwide 
strikes in august 1980 and was chartered by the government that 
fall becoming the only independent labor movement ever allowed in 
the soviet bloc 
it developed as polands main political opposition but was 
crushed in a december 1981 military crackdown and subsequently 
outlawed by parliament

president kenneth kaunda reelected to his 
sixth term last week on wednesday announced a smaller cabinet and 
promised sweeping economic reforms 
kaunda 64 who led the british colony of northern rhodesia to 
independence as the nation of zambia on oct 24 1964 reduced the 
previous 22member cabinet to 16 
the president holding his first news conference since being 
installed as head of state on monday dubbed it a budgetcutting 
cabinet 
while the move met western donors demands for cuts in state 
spending in return for aid to help his ailing economy kaunda also 
named 22 ministers of state to assist the cabinet cabinet ministers 
who were dropped from the previous government won posts as ministers 
of state 
zambia is burdened by record unemployment galloping inflation 
and a foreign debt of 4 billion that drains 40 percent of export 
income most of those earnings have come from exports of copper 
among the state ministers were his son wezi who has been 
mentioned as a possible successor 
kawnda said the new cabinets main task would be to carry out 
economic reforms now that he is armed with a mandate from the 26 
million voters in his land of 7 million people 
kaunda last year abandoned an international monetary 
fundprescribed recovery program after 15 people were killed in 
rioting over a doubling of food prices that move held down prices 
but most western aid donors withdrew all aid until he accepted 
harsher measures to straighten out the economy 
he said he hoped the imf would resume relations with his country 
once the economy was restructured 
kaunda also announced that the countrys international and 
domestic airports would be privatized party insiders said they 
expect further privatization of state corporations that cost the 
government tens of millions of dollars in subsidies every year

space shuttle atlantis was moved to 
the launch pad wednesday for a flight late this month in which the 
crew will deploy a pentagon intelligencegathering satellite and try 
to determine mans role as a military observer in orbit 
perched vertically atop a huge transporter with a tanklike 
tread atlantis headed out of an assembly building into the darkness 
shortly after 1 am completing the snailspace fourmile trip 
seven hours later at launch pad 39b 
the move befitting the classified nature of the mission was 
made without the floodlights music speeches and cheers of 
thousands of workers who showed up when discovery rolled to the pad 
july 4 for the first shuttle mission since the 1986 challenger 
explosion that killed seven astronauts 
discovery returned americans to space sept 29 and successfully 
completed its mission four days later 
conrad nagel atlantis processing director said nasa was aiming 
for a launch nov 28 or 29 a firm date wont be set until after a 
flight readiness review nov 16 
nagels team began readying atlantis in march 1987 for its third 
journey into space making more than 200 modifications to improve 
the spacecrafts safety and performance 
we are simply clean as far as any technical problems he told 
reporters wednesday 
atlantis will have a crew of five headed by navy cmdr robert

the air force has been planning several experiments for upcoming 
shuttle flights to determine the utility of astronauts for strategic 
reconnaissance surveillance of soviet naval forces and other 
operational military objectives 
the tests will be coordinated with with ground exercises 
including troop maneuvers naval movements and ballistic missile 
launches it is not known publicly which of the exercises will be 
conducted on the upcoming mission because the defense department has 
thrown a cloak of secrecy over most details 
officials have said the launch will occur between 632 am and 
932 am but the time wont be made public until the countdown 
reaches nine minutes before liftoff 
once atlantis is safely in orbit there will be a news blackout 
except for a brief announcement every 24 hours saying the shuttle is 
still up there that plan will be broken only if something serious 
goes wrong sixteen hours advance notice will be given of the 
landing 
two more defense department shuttle flights and seven unmanned 
titan launches are planned in the next year as the pentagon aims to 
start moving into space a backlog of more than 20 payloads grounded 
by the challenger accident and the explosion of a titan rocket three 
months later

nighttime curfew wednesday after attacks by radical sinhalese left 
at least 16 people dead the radicals called a strike and threatened 
to kill all who defied it 
security forces were put on maximum alert in preparation for 
thursdays strike called by the peoples liberation front 
state radio said the curfew would be in effect from 11 pm to 4 
am 
attackers believed to be sinhalese radicals hurled a bomb into a 
home in the southern coast town of tangalle overnight killing seven 
members of a family police said 
in another attack also blamed on the peoples liberation front 
five policemen were injured by a homemade landmine in the northern 
part of the island the military command said 
the front has vowed to kill supporters of an accord aimed at 
ending the war by minority tamils who want more autonomy radical 
sinhalese believe the accord makes too many concessions to the 
tamils who comprise 18 percent of the nations 16 million people 
the sinhalesedominated government has blamed the front for the 
assassinations of more than 500 people since the accord was signed 
15 months ago 
on wednesday the radical group told one of the largest 
governmentrun newspapers the associated newspapers of ceylon 
limited and a communistrun daily to stop publication from thursday 
or face its wrath 
the warning issued through leaflets in colombo also threatened 
with death those who disobeyed its directive

pannala army base 30 miles northeast of colombo the government said 
nine people died in the attack four soldiers four attackers and 
one civilian 
in tangalle 70 miles southeast of colombo police said they had 
little information about the bomb deaths of the seven civilians 
however a senior police official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the family may have been suspected of passing 
information about front members to police 
the mine explosion occurred at eppawala 92 miles northeast of 
colombo while police were removing antigovernment posters 
according to a spokesman for the military command in colombo he 
said the peoples liberation front was thought to be responsible for 
the explosion 
the front has been at the vanguard of a sinhalese backlash the 
1987 accord which was signed by the leaders of sri lanka and india 
india sri lankas northern neighbor with a large tamil population 
of its own mediated the accord 
the accord would grant a measure of autonomy to tamils if the 
guerrillas lay down their arms the largest tamil rebel group has 
refused to accept the accord 
tamils say they need a separate homeland to combat what they say 
is discrimination in educations and jobs sinhalese who account for 
75 percent of the population hold most top government and military 
offices

every time republican senate candidate connie mack 
hits television viewers with one of his hey buddy youre 
liberal commercials democratic rival buddy mackay winces and 
moves a little further away from michael dukakis 
im in the lloyd bentsen wing of the democratic party he 
says michael dukakis is speaking for michael dukakis not buddy 
mackay 
the ghostly image of the democratic presidential nominee as a 
bigspending liberal is giving mackay the shivers and stirring 
macks hopes of squeaking through to an election victory next 
tuesday in one of the most closely fought senate battles in the 
nation 
the tightness of the race to succeed popular democratic sen 
lawton chiles who is retiring after three terms could test the 
strength of republican presidential nominee george bushs coattails 
recent polls give the vice president a doubledigit lead over 
dukakis among florida voters up to 27 percentage points in one 
survey but indicate that the contest between mack and mackay both 
of them sixyear house veterans is too close to call 
although democrats have a 3to2 edge among registered voters 
ticketsplitting is a recent phenomenon in florida and the mack 
campaign has been trying to gain a boost from bushs popularity 
one tv ad shows bush urging floridians to send mack to the senate 
to help him as president another features a film clip of the vice 
president telling the gop national convention to read my lips no 
new taxes 
a third commercial says dukakis and mackay stand together on 
defense issues and opposing aid for the nicaraguan contra rebels 
and concludes hey buddy and mike youre liberal 
mack says he represents the same florida conservatives who gave 
ronald reagan lopsided victories in 1980 and 1984 and boasts that 
he will be able to pick up the telephone and talk personally to the 
president if bush is elected 
mackay responds by embracing vice presidential nominee bentsen 
the moderate texas senator and keeping dukakis at arms length 
he tells crimeconscious floridians that he supports the death 
penalty for drugrelated murders dukakis opposes capital punishment 
like dukakis mackay says he opposes the b1 bomber and other 
defense programs he regards as costly boondoggles but favors a 
strong military he says he would consider higher taxes only on such 
excise levies as cigarettes and liquor 
he calls himself a southern moderatetoconservative in the mold 
of chiles and sens albert gore of tennessee sam nunn of georgia 
and bob graham of florida all of whom have campaigned for mackay 
graham warns floridians that they will lose clout in the senate 
if they elect an ideological wacko like mack 
mack 48 repeats the mantra of less taxes less government 
less spending more freedom at every opportunity mackay charges 
that his opponent votes a bizarre ideological agenda that is 
antiflorida and offensive to environmentalists and the elderly 
the two candidates entered congress together in 1982 with 
dramatically different styles philosophies and backgrounds 
mackay 55 whose country boy look belies his affluence as the 
son of a central florida landowning family spent 12 years in the 
state legislature and lost a 1980 bid for the democratic senate 
nomination one of the most highly respected politicians in florida 
for years he was heartily endorsed this year by nearly all the 
states daily newspapers 
mackay was preparing for a 1990 bid for the governorship when 
former twoterm gov reubin askew declared himself fed up with the 
time required for fund raising and on may 7 dropped out of a senate 
race that was considered his 
mackay relying on a dedicated cadre of volunteers came from 
behind to gain a runoff election against state insurance 
commissioner bill gunter whom mackay defeated for the democratic 
nomination on oct 4 
connie mack bears the name of his grandfather the famed manager 
of the philadelphia athletics baseball team who adopted a nickname 
in place of his real name cornelius mcgillicuddy 
the placid telegenic mack was born in philadelphia and moved to 
florida with his family in 1951 he became a bank president in the 
small southwest gulf coast town of cape coral like reagan mack 
says he is a former liberal democrat whose views evolved into gop 
conservatism he says it was reagans 1980 election that inspired 
him to enter politics 
he won in 1982 and was easily reelected twice in the house he 
is a member of the republican band of young conservative activists 
led by rep newt gingrich of georgia when national gop leaders 
urged him to challenge chiles mack left rep jack kemps 
presidential campaign team to enter the senate race in october 1987 
although mackay has a moderate record hes undoubtedly too 
liberal for mack who has one of the most conservative records in 
congress mack has been host of fundraising appearances by reagan 
and irancontra figure oliver north 
he refused to debate his primary opponent former us attorney 
robert merkle who carried a lifesize cutout called cardboard 
connie and derided his foe as an intellectual lightweight 
when mack won the primary with 62 percent of the vote merkle 
didnt endorse him but promised only that he wouldnt oppose him 
meanwhile gunter eased democratic fears of a divided party by 
campaigning for mackay

the reagan administration told the supreme 
court today that mandatory drug tests for some railroad workers and 
us customs service employees are vital to public safety and 
confidence in government 
attorney general dick thornburgh in an unusual move appeared 
himself to plead for testing of rail workers after train accidents 
this is a case about railway safety he said it is about 
the hazards created by use of drugs and alcohol by those in charge 
of trains 
solicitor general charles fried the administrations top 
courtroom lawyer defended the customs service drug testing program 
there is rather special urgent and symbolic significance in 
assuring the public that the agency responsible for preventing drug 
smuggling has a drugfree work force fried said 
the customs service is indeed entitled to take a fine filter to 
show to itself its workers and the public that workers are not 
involved in drug use he said 
the drug tests were attacked as a humiliating invasion of 
privacy by lois williams representing the customs service workers 
innocent persons have a great deal of reason to be 
apprehensive she said 
lawrence mann an attorney for the railway workers said the drug 
tests are unconstitutional because they are incapable of proving 
onthejob impairment 
neither the alcohol nor the drug test can demonstrate 
impairment he said the tests can show the presence of a residue 
from a drug that may have been taken by someone 60 days ago in the 
privacy of home 
the two cases will provide a crucial test for mandatory drug 
testing in the american workplace 
thornburghs appearance underscored the importance of todays 
twohour argument session 
benjamin civiletti was the last attorney general to argue a case 
before the justices when he appeared in 1980 to present the carter 
administrations side in a case involving the deportation of an 
alleged nazi 
thornburgh last argued a case before the high court in 1977 when 
he headed the justice departments criminal division 
in todays cases the justices agreed to decide whether the 
nations railroads may require all employees involved in accidents 
to take drug tests and whether the customs service may impose the 
tests for those seeking drugenforcement jobs 
both cases involve governmental authority to test workers for the 
presence of drugs 
the eventual rulings by the court expected sometime in 1989 
will not deal with drug tests for private employees but the 
decisions could have an important psychological impact on whether 
businesses will demand that their workers undergo such tests 
tests conducted by federal state or local governments will be 
affected directly by the courts action 
in the railroad case the federal railroad administration issued 
regulations in 1985 aimed at alleviating a significant safety 
problem caused by alcohol and drug use among employees 
the agency an arm of the us department of transportation 
generally requires railroads to take blood and urine specimens after 
accidents incidents and rules violations 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled in february that the 
tests are unreasonable searches banned by the constitutions fourth 
amendment 
accidents incidents or rule violations by themselves do not 
create reasonable grounds for suspecting that tests will demonstrate 
alcohol or drug impairment in any one railroad employee much less 
an entire train crew the appeals court said 
government lawyers have said that from 1972 through 1983 
railroad accidents linked to drug or alcohol abuse killed 42 people 
injured 61 and caused some 19 million in property damage 
in the customs service case the government contends the need to 
fight drug smuggling justifies mandatory tests for those applying 
for or holding drugenforcement jobs 
workers in such sensitive jobs must provide urine samples in 
restroom stalls as a person overseeing the procedure waits outside 
the stall testing was authorized under an executive order president 
reagan signed in 1986 
the reagan administration has said the tests are needed to 
prevent agents who use drugs from being bribed or blackmailed any 
sacrifice of personal privacy is outweighed by the need to stop drug 
smuggling the administration said 
the national treasury employees union in challenging the tests 
said they subject workers to a humiliating invasion of privacy 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the tests for 
customs service workers in such sensitive jobs

lech walesa told a rally of nearly all the 
10000 workers at the lenin shipyard wednesday that solidarity and a 
governmentbacked union will cooperate for the first time to try to 
keep the shipyard open 
the government meanwhile announced a new approach to walesa by 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak to start delayed talks 
between authorities and the opposition on polands future 
walesa leader of the outlawed solidarity union announced the 
unprecedented cooperation with the rival official opzz trade union 
during the outdoor rally at the shipyard where solidarity sprang up 
during nationwide strikes in august 1980 
the rally took place on the first workday since the government on 
monday revealed its plans to close the yard dec 1 citing economic 
reasons the move was denounced by activists as a deliberate blow by 
new prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski aimed at his longtime 
nemesis solidarity a charge rakowski has denied 
solidarity and the official trade union said in a joint 
resolution that the liquidation of the enterprise is a 
completely political decision because the financial position of the 
shipyard is advantageous at the present moment 
one must not decide the future of the gdansk shipyard without 
consulting the workcrew we will defend our shipyard 
but walesa appeared to rule out a strike for the moment said it 
would only make the situation worse activists said they wanted 
to avoid creating any confrontation that might jeopardize mrs 
thatchers planned visit to a monument just outside the shipyard 
friday 
walesa said the common position reached by solidarity with the 
opzz is proof the unions can reach agreement at any moment 
provided we are not set against each other by someone else 
we are united by this single goal saving the shipyard he 
said it proves that pluralism is possible 
he added that he has received messages from all over the country 
that people are willing to buy shares in the shipyard in order to 
preserve it 
the joint stance with the official union marks a reversal of 
solidaritys earlier position not to talk to opzz which was set up 
in 1982 after the martiallaw crackdown on solidarity 
although the opzz continues to oppose introduction of union 
pluralism saying it alone can best represent all workers even 
solidarity supporters hostility between the opzz and solidarity 
has been diminishing on the factory floor the two groups have been 
known to cooperate on local issues 
solidarity questions the independence of the official union 
particularly at the national level the head of the opzz is a member 
of the ruling communist party politiburo 
this is for the first time that opzz and solidarity have 
declared cooperation so publically and so officially although not 
100 percent of unionists are ready to defend the shipyard at any 
cost said franciszek ciemny national spokesman for the opzz 
interviewed by telephone in warsaw 
he said the opzz national secretariat met about the shipyard 
wednesday and endorsed the governments motives to reform the 
economy but decided to press for improvements in the shipyards 
efficiency rather than an abrupt closure 
the opzz leadership asked for a meeting with government officials 
nov 9 to set procedures for working out alternative solutions to 
the shutting down of workplaces ciemny said 
walesa said he believed rakowskis decision to close the shipyard 
has ended hopes that the roundtable between authorities and the 
opposition on polands future could begin soon 
at this moment it is losing sense he said on the one hand 
you are trying to talk about various subjects and on the other hand 
you close the cradle of solidarity and walesas workplace it 
doesnt make sense 
he said he wasnt pronouncing the talks dead but said he hoped 
authorities would reconsider their recent actions 
at the shipyard rally management encouraged workers to take up 
tools and work peaceably the thousands of workers who braved icy 
wind to report for 6 am shift appeared willing to follow the 
advice 
just the way we fight beautifully and sing beautifully we are 
going to work beautifully walesa said 
the yard has long been a symbol of worker dissent in poland its 
august 1980 strike toppled communist party leader edward gierek and 
a strike in august of this year contributed to the ouster of prime 
minister zbigniew messner 
rakowski said he ordered the closing of the yard as the first 
major act of his pledge to restructure polands outdated 
moneylosing heavy industries 
government spokesman jerzy urban contacted polish state radio to 
say the prime minister has asked kiszczak to turn to lech walesa 
to mutually overcome the difficulties in the preparation for the 
round table 
but there was no sign the government was prepared to drop its 
objections to solidaritys proposed delegation to the talks which 
has been the major stumbling block 
the longpromised talks due to start in midoctober stalled 
when the government required walesa to purge two delegates whom 
authorities deemed extremist walesa refused to allow interference 
in his delegation saying it would set a bad precedent 
the developments came as prime minister margaret thatcher of 
britain arrived in poland beginning a threeday visit set to 
include meetings with top political leaders as well as a highly 
symbolic excursion to gdansk to see walesa

twenty people detained during an 
illegal independence day rally last week face fines and criminal 
prosecution according to newspapers received in prague on wednesday 
eight more people detained prior to another rally are likely to 
be charged with incitement which carries a sentence of up to eight 
years in prison 
newspapers from the moravian capital of brno said about 350 
people took part in the banned rally friday to commemorate the 70th 
anniversary of czechoslovakias independence 
the crowd included young people in extravagant dress 
activists with the human rights movement charter 77 and 
deplorably also mothers with small children one newspaper 
account said 
the brno newspapers said 39 people were detained after police 
broke up the brno demonstration and that 20 of them face charges 
the newspapers said eight will be charged with unspecified 
misdeeds which can be tried before a criminal court and 12 face 
misdemeanor charges which are tried before national committees 
tribunals of local representatives 
both can be entered on a persons identity documents giving them 
a police record 
the same day as the brno rally police used tear gas water 
cannon batons and dogs to break up an illegal rally in prague by 
about 5000 people 
authorities announced that eight people detained during a sweep 
before that rally face charges of incitement that could send them to 
jail for up to eight years 
pragues evening newspaper vecerni praha said monday that 
employers of each of the eight activists with the independent peace 
association will be informed in writing about the charges 
the newspaper criticized by name hana marvanova a leading 
activist saying she was frequently absent from work and used this 
time mostly for antistate activities 
other prague activists held were described as having previous 
convictions for rowdiness theft and drugrelated offenses 
petr uhl a leading activist told the associated press in vienna 
that most of the dozens of others who were detained including 
banned playwright vaclav havel had been released 
uhl a charter 77 signatory said the eight still in custody 
included three prominent members of the independent peace 
association tomas dvorak hana marvanova and lubos vydra 
the peace association was one of five groups that called the 
prague rally 
the other activists still in custody were petr cibulka dusan 
skala ivan jirous jiri tichy and a roman catholic priest 
frantisek lizna uhl said 
uhl said havel who was detained thursday was released monday 
without being charged

incitement against a new dissident group the movement for civil 
freedom he said house searches and interrogations were conducted in 
the past five days

just about everybody it seems is becoming 
turned off by the neverending opinion polls of the 1988 
presidential campaign which critics say are trivializing issues and 
alienating voters 
democratis nominee michael dukakis who is trailing in the polls 
has led the attack on their role in the election even republicans 
are questioning whether survey results may improperly influence 
voters choices 
the question is whether these polls are giving the impression 
to the american people that their vote doesnt matter republican 
national chairman frank j fahrenkopf jr said in an interview 
there is that danger 
the public also is down on polls fortyfive percent in a recent 
gallup survey said reporting whos ahead is bad for the country and 
as many said polls do not improve election coverage even more 52 
percent said polls should not be reported in the final weeks of a 
presidential campaign 
that disquiet may stem from the way polls have muscled so heavily 
into the contest this year bush and dukakis have been rated in more 
than 90 major national surveys six times the number conducted in 
the 1964 election 
i think people are a little tired of all the horserace polls 
said andrew kohut president of the gallup organization they want 
to know what the state of the race is and theyre interested in 
public opinion but there has been such a barrage of polls that 
theyre saturated 
dukakis frustrated by his persistent underdog showing in the 
polls has begun to lash out he says voters are not going to let 
the pollsters or anyone else make their decisions for them 
in fact the polltakers agree poll results may shape 
perceptions of whos ahead but they do not influence voter 
decisions the experts said in interviews this week the evidence is 
in the polls themselves 
every time people complain about the polls they talk about it 
leading opinion said cbs news pollster warren mitofsky if that 
was the case the polls would never change except to go up for the 
leading candidate 
i dont know of a single pollster or political analyst who 
believes that the polls are creating a bandwagon effect said 
everett ladd head of the roper center for public opinion research 
at the university of connecticut 
theres a lot of evidence that people reach their voting 
decisions for deep and very substantial reasons ladd said they 
have interests and identifications that they bring to bear on the 
process they arent tossed around because of what a poll finds 
gallup polls provide evidence the share of respondents who 
expect bush to win grew from 45 percent in midaugust to 68 percent 
last week but bushs lead grew by far less from four points to 10 
among registered voters 
whats happening is that people are recognizing that bush is 
ahead said kohut but it doesnt seem to be affecting voter 
preferences 
there are other concerns critics say polls have hogged too much 
of the medias campaign coverage and that the focus on bushs lead 
could dissuade voters from turning out on election day 
its not just the existence of the polls themselves its when 
we get into the indication of the polls that the race is over 
fahrenkopf said i have no indication that that affects voter 
turnout but it could 
cbs news mitofsky argues that it does not despite the 
proliferation of polls participation has stayed at the same share 
of the number of people registered in every election since 1964 
he said 
if people were only going to vote for who they thought would 
win mitofsky said then there wouldnt be a single democratic 
vote for president cast in utah where republicans predominate in 
national races 
a related question is whether exit polls discouraged turnout in 
1980 when the networks declared ronald reagan the winner while 
polls in the west were still open 
los angeles times pollster ia lewis said his surveys indicated 
turnout was not affected by the call but it is difficult to gauge 
if such polls did discourage turnout lewis noted the effect at 
least would likely be evenhanded with the results creating 
complacency among one candidates backers as much as discouragement 
among the others 
some pollsters agreed that surveys have drawn increasing and 
perhaps inordinate media attention 
but lewis noted that before news organizations conducted polls 
they made do with possibly misleading briefings from the candidates 
own pollsters without the polls kohut said the media would rely 
on the unsubstantiated views of pundits 
its unfortunate the candidates are hammered by the polls 
kohut said but if it wasnt the polls theyd be hammered by some 
other less objective measure of the dynamics of the race

a navy program to train dolphins as underwater 
security guards is in disarray with four of the animals dead and 
others blinded or crippled by abusive handlers a newspaper reported 
today 
the seattle postintelligencer quoted unidentified sources 
including two former trainers who asked that their names be 
withheld as saying four of the navys three dozen dolphins have 
died in the past 18 months 
the former trainers said some of the dolphins have been blinded 
or have suffered crippling injuries as a result of poor training 
procedures 
the program which trains dolphins to hunt for mines and enemy 
frogmen leaves the animals vulnerable to infection or illness by 
moving them from cooler to warmer water and subjects them to other 
stress they said 
in washington navy spokesman lt cmdr craig quigley today 
denied animals had been mistreated 
we simply do not use negative techniques and browbeat these 
mammals into doing what we want to do said quigley even the 
environmental group greenpeace has complimented our training 
methods as better than the industry 
we use positive reinforcement and we depend upon a close 
relationship between the trainer and animal ultimately in the 
training you have to go to the open ocean if we were mistreating 
these mammals why would they return to their trainers 
a trainer rick trout who has worked at the navy project in san 
diego since 1985 told a convention of the international marine 
animal trainers association in san antonio texas this week he saw 
specific incidences of abuse weight loss corporal punishment and 
damage to animals after transport 
trainers use very negative methods including food deprivation 
corporal punishment hitting and other aversive techniques 
trout said 
the newspaper said one dolphin died last month near port townsend 
and two others died earlier in san diego where the program is based 
last year a dolphin died during patrol in the persian gulf of 
what the navy said was some type of bacterial infection that 
developed into pneumonia after that four other dolphins were 
returned to united states 
a persian gulf environmentalist who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said at the time that the dolphin probably was not used 
to the gulf environment and its bacteria 
quigley said the navy program currently includes 115 animals 
most of them dolphins and the remainder sea lions and beluga whales 
the work began more than 20 years ago and the navy has records 
showing its mortality rate is much lower than the industry standard 
quigley added he said he was checking to determine if there had 
been four deaths in the past 18 months 
i know of two deaths within the past year he said one 
involved a dolphin sent to the persian gulf and the other involved 
a dolphin that died 11 days after being sent to indian island in the 
pacific northwest were still awaiting laboratory reports on the 
cause of that last death 
but i can say categorically that we have not had any deaths 
through mistreatment 
sources quoted by the newspaper blamed the projects problems on 
rapid turnover among employees in san diego and pressure to expand 
the project to the trident nuclear submarine base at bangor and 
other sites

president corazon aquino ordered the 
nations largest domestic shipping firm closed wednesday while the 
government inspects its crews and ships after accidents that killed 
thousands of people 
officials of the company sulpicio lines inc said the 
indefinite closing was unfair and would disrupt shipping across the 
island nation 
the order came nine days after sulpicios dona marilyn ferry sank 
during a typhoon with about 500 people aboard in december another 
sulpicio ferry the dona paz collided with an oil tanker and sank 
the official death toll of that accident was about 1500 but some 
estimates have said more than 3000 people may have died 
since sulpicio is beset by these accidents we would like to 
have a closer look at their operations secretary of 
transportation reinerio reyes said 
reyes told reporters mrs aquino was aware of the ship shortage 
in the philippines and ordered the inspection of sulpicios vessels 
be completed as soon as possible 
the main reason is we want to prevent loss of lives reyes 
said we want to make sure the ships are seaworthy and manned by 
competent crews 
sulpicio operates 22 passenger and cargo vessels which account 
for 20 percent of domestic sea traffic among the countrys 7200 
islands 
in the central philippine city of cebu hub of the countrys 
domestic shipping sulpicios president and general manager carlos 
go said he was unaware of the order 
its bad for the public because they have fewer vessels to 
ride go said he refused further comment 
gos brother eusebio the companys executive vice president 
said the order was unnecessary and unfair 
they can inspect the ships without suspending the operations 
he said sulpicio officials were to appear before the maritime 
industry authority a department of transportation agency on 
thursday to show why the companys operations should not be 
suspended 
reyes said he recommended to mrs aquino that sulpicio be 
temporarily closed so its ships could be inspected and their crews 
qualifications tested 
the president agreed that this was the right step to take he 
said adding that the companys franchise could be if widespread 
deficiencies were found 
before reyes met with mrs aquino his department issued orders 
holding four sulpicio ships in port because they allegedly had 
inadequate communications equipment 
the search for victims of the dona marilyn sinking is still going 
on like the dona paz it has been difficult to determine the number 
of victims because of confusion over how many people were aboard 
the dona marilyn sailed oct 23 from manila for the leyte island 
port of tacloban despite warnings that typhoon ruby was approaching 
vicente gambito vice president of sulpicio lines said 161 
passengers and 39 crewmen were rescued after it sank about 300 miles 
southeast of manila 
he said at least 76 people were confirmed dead but only 54 bodies 
had been recovered 
sulpicio said the manifest showed about 487 passengers and crew 
but the ship radioed after leaving manila that it was carrying 517 
people the coast guard in manila said it counted 491 people before 
the ship left manila

a man awaiting execution early thursday 
for the murder of a nurse appealed to the us supreme court for a 
reprieve today 
a federal court in san antonio and an appeals court in new 
orleans on tuesday had refused to halt the execution of donald gene 
franklin 37 
franklins case virtually halted all texas executions for a year 
when the supreme court agreed to consider his challenge to the texas 
capital punishment law 
but the court in june rejected 63 his claim that jurors were not 
allowed to consider mitigating circumstances in deciding his 
punishment 
defense attorney george scharmen filed an appeal today with the 
nations highest court franklin who has had three trials and at 
least five execution dates faces lethal injection for the 1975 
abductionslaying of a san antonio nurse 
the threejudge federal appeals court panel that turned down 
franklins request tuesday said the inmates third such attempt 
presents no more than one warmedover variation on a claim made 
earlier and denied 
in their latest appeal to the supreme court attorneys are again 
raising the issue of mitigating circumstances specifically 
testimony from franklins mother about his growing up in a broken 
home and hope the high courts review of another texas case 
involving death row inmate johnny penry will mean a reprieve for 
franklin 
theres some reason for optimism based on penry scharmen 
said on the other hand franklin has received three trials and 
several stays so in terms of optimism i really dont know what to 
say 
state attorneys have characterized franklin on death row for 
nearly 12 years as the most likely to die of the more than 280 
condemned inmates in texas 
this time i think its maybe finally going to happen said 
bill zapalac an assistant attorney general

taxpayers bill of rights said wednesday he plans to ask 
congress next year to review the 152 types of penalties that can be 
imposed by the internal revenue service 
we think that many of those 152 penalties are extremely 
arbitrary and were going to be reviewing them pryor said 
pryor commented during a breakfast meeting with about 40 people 
to thank a variety of groups for supporting his taxpayers bill of 
rights the measure was approved by the senate and house two weeks 
ago as part of a package of tax legislation enacted shortly before 
the 100th congress adjourned 
the bill has yet to be signed by president reagan pryor noted 
but i dont believe he will veto it 
the bill requires the irs to tell taxpayers about their rights 
before being audited allows taxpayers to be represented by lawyers 
during all proceedings and also permits taxpayers to collect damages 
in suits against the irs 
we did something that has not been done for 124 years and that 
is strengthen the hand of the taxpayers pryor said 
sen harry reid dnev a cosponsor of the bill agreed this 
is something that will really help the american public he told

district of columbia mayor marion barry lent 
credibility and respectability to south africas apartheid regime by 
participating in a bahamian golf tournament partially supported by 
an oil company doing business in that african nation according to a 
local union official 
joslyn n williams president of the washington metropolitan 
council of the aflcio said he was distressed that barry was 
present for the tournament which began wednesday 
barry has been one of the most prominent washington leaders of 
the movement to boycott the royal dutchshell group of companies 
williams said tuesday the shell companies are partial sponsors of 
the tournament according to a tournament organizer 
barrys press secretary john c white said the trip was paid 
for by resorts international ltd a company that operates gambling 
casinos including a casino at the paradise island resort in the 
bahamas 
white said barry was not a golfer and would not participate in 
the tournament 
barry said he knew the tournament was partially sponsored by 
shell but added everybody knows where i stand on south africa 
i cut up my credit card from shell he said 
barry returned to washington on monday from a fiveday business 
trip to california and hawaii 
tournament director fred higgs told the washington post the 
paradise island celebrity golf tournaments major sponsors were the 
bahamas ministry of tourism and resorts international he declined 
to say how much shell contributed to the event 
white said city officials had determined the antiapartheid 
boycott was aimed at shells south african and us subsidiaries 
not its company in the bahamas 
as far as im concerned it does not make any difference 
whether it is shell usa shell bahamas it is all part of one 
giant conglomerate and that conglomerate is exploiting blacks in 
south africa williams said 
when prominent leaders especially prominent black leaders get 
tied in with shell in any shape or form it diminishes the struggle 
in south africa he said

programs to help people lower their risk of heart 
disease should put more emphasis on losing weight and getting 
exercise according to a new study 
the recommendation is based on a finding that both dieting and 
exercise help men and women improve their cholesterol levels 
experts have long known that fat people who are at increased 
risk of heart trouble also have relatively low levels of 
highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol or hdl this socalled good 
cholesterol helps keep the arteries free of dangerous deposits 
on the other hand people who get lots of exercise tend to have 
higher amounts of protective hdl 
the latest study conducted at stanford university was intended 
to look separately at the effects of dieting and exercise on the 
cholesterol levels of overweight men it found that men who slimmed 
down were able to raise their good cholesterol levels regardless of 
whether they took off the weight through dieting or exercising 
it appears that attention to weight loss and increased exercise 
should be more strongly emphasized in contemporary campaigns to 
reduce risk of coronary heart disease the researchers wrote 
the study was directed by dr peter d wood and published in 
thursdays new england journal of medicine 
for a year they studied 131 overweight men who ranged in age 
from 30 to 59 onethird of them went on diets onethird jogged and 
the rest did nothing differently although only men were studied 
the study said its conclusions would apply to both men and women 
in an accompanying editorial drs henry blackburn and david r 
jacobs jr of the university of minnesota said that burning up 150 
to 300 calories a day in such moderate activities as walking and 
working around the house is beneficial exercise

iran and iraq held their second facetoface peace 
talks in 24 hours wednesday and the un secretarygeneral said the 
quickened pace showed a willingness by both sides to end their war 
but statements from the iranian and iraqi foreign ministers made 
clear there has been no narrowing of positions 
foreign ministers ali akbar velayati of iran and tariq aziz of 
iraq agreed tuesday to meet facetoface in all future sessions to 
speed up the negotiations 
the talks are aimed at consolidating a truce that went into 
effect aug 20 after both sides accepted a un security council 
ceasefire resolution 
until now the talks had been mostly conducted in an indirect 
fashion with un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and his 
mediating team shuttling between the two delegations seated in 
separate rooms 
perez de cuellar said the change was a very good sign 
velayati and aziz did not talk to reporters as they arrived for 
the joint session at the european un headquarters 
earlier aziz renewed baghdads call for an exchange of war 
prisoners to proceed immediately 
after meeting with the president of the international committee 
of the red cross cornelio sommaruga aziz said the international 
community should pressure iran to agree to the prisoner exchange 
independent of what happens in the talks 
iran through a delegation spokesman reiterated its demand that 
such an exchange should come in the framework of the talks 
spokesman morteza sarmadi said priority should be given to 
withdrawal of the forces to internationally recognized boundaries 
troops are only a few yards apart at some points 
definition of the common border is the main stumbling block in 
the talks which began aug 25 
iran and iraq are pledged to begin repatriation of war prisoners 
without delay after cessation of hostilities the international 
committee of the red cross oversees its implementation 
in a note to both countries oct 4 the red cross asked baghdad 
and tehran to facilitate an agreement on the exchange by providing 
complete lists of the prisoners they hold and proceeding with 
repatriation of the sick and wounded 
the red cross has registered 50182 iraqi prisoners in iran and 
19284 iranians in iraq it estimates that the number of 
unregistered prisoners is at least 20000 to 30000 in both iran and 
iraq 
a un report compiled in july said the number of prisoners in 
iraq may be close to 35000 and in iraq up to 75000

us and soviet negotiators failed wednesday to 
settle their dispute over a siberian radar facility and the reagan 
administration warned it may take steps to unravel the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty 
after soviet experts outlined their views at a meeting in geneva 
the state department demanded that the installation at krasnoyarsk 
be dismantled and its equipment destroyed 
unfortunately the soviet experts did not have any new 
proposal department spokesman charles e redman said in giving an 
account of the session 
in two reports to congress the administration charged the 
soviets with violating the abm treaty by constructing a radar 
facility that could be used to organize a national defense against 
missile attack 
the theory behind the treaty is that if both sides were unable to 
mount a defense they would hesitate to launch an attack otherwise 
their territory and populations would be open to devastating 
retaliation 
the geneva session was held at the soviets request and indicated 
a settlement might be possible viktor p karpov the foreign 
ministrys senior arms control specialist had said in july that the 
soviets would dismantle the krasnoyarsk radar if the two sides 
resolved their differences over the 1972 treaty 
we had hoped they were prepared to meet us concerns about the 
radar redman told reporters we listened to what they had 
to say unfortunately the soviet experts did not have any new 
proposals 
as a result the spokesman said the united states reserved its 
right under international law to take appropriate and 
proportionate responses to the soviet violation we have not 
foreclosed the option of declaring that violation a material 
breach he said 
such a declaration could lead to us nullification of the abm 
treaty which many arms control specialists consider to be a 
landmark in deterring nuclear war 
administration officials were sharply divided last spring on 
whether to threaten the soviets with the declaration eventually 
president reagan decided on a postponement while encouraging moscow 
to dismantle the krasnoyarsk radar 
even some of the administrations sharpest critics consider the 
facility in violation of the treaty but they say the united states 
is engaged in questionable radar operations itself in britain and in 
greenland 
the krasnoyarsk radar is a violation of the abm treaty 
redman said weve made it clear that violations must be corrected 
without delay 
the spokesman added based on what we heard today we continue 
to believe strongly that the us criteria can only be met by 
dismantlement of the radar and destruction of the transmitter and 
receiver

now that hes captured if the legendary 
16foot wadsworth gator could talk he might tell these residents 
east of reno a couple of things 
first hes a south american caiman whos only 3 feet long and 10 
pounds 
second he likes cheeseburgers much better than the chicken bait 
thats been set out for him as lures in the truckee river wheres 
hes been vacationing for the past few weeks 
nevada game warden steve albert took custody tuesday of the 
caiman a reptile cousin of the alligator albert said he would try 
to find a new home for the caiman in a zoo or aquarium 
the reptile was first spotted in the river oct 14 and was 
probably dumped there by someone who tired of it as a pet albert 
said 
since the first sighting wadsworth residents had believed that 
the reptile was an alligator the towns storytellers eventually 
talked the legendary beast up to a 16footer 
the state department of wildlife became involved and set chicken 
meat bait traps along the river but to no avail 
but last week robert lester 22 of sparks and john warner 26 
of reno captured the caiman while fishing for trout 
warner said he kept the caiman in his bathtub and fed it 
cheeseburgers hoping to make him a pet even though thats illegal 
in nevada 
but warner finally decided to give up the caiman and collect a 
500 reward a reno businessman had put up for the wadsworth 
gator 
eddie floyd a university of florida alumnus said he offered the 
money because the alligator is the mascot of the universitys sports 
team 
floyd paid the reward tuesday then immediately gave up custody of 
the caiman to wildlife officials 
i cant take it back to florida because there are no florida 
fightin caimans floyd lamented but im glad its ok just the 
same

the nations productivity rose by an annual 
rate of 13 percent from july through september the government said 
wednesday reversing a second quarter decline when new employment 
had outpaced increases in goods and services 
but analysts cautioned that the longterm trend of anemic 
productivity growth offers little hope for lifting americans 
standard of living or increasing us competitiveness overseas 
output of goods and services by nonfarm businesses rose at an 
annual rate of 28 percent in the third quarter while the number of 
hours worked increased only 15 percent the labor department said 
but the overtheyear productivity improvement has been only 08 
percent the government said revised figures showed that 
productivity dropped 24 percent in the second quarter much worse 
than the 14 percent decline estimated previously 
despite the strong growth of the economy over the past year 
theres still no significant change in a the weak trend in 
productivity that weve seen since 1973 said larry chimerine 
chairman of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa economic consulting 
firm 
productivity growth averaging 1 percent a year remains this 
countrys major economic problem he said until we get it on a 
stronger upward trend were not going to see any increase in real 
wages or in our international competitiveness 
unit labor costs rose at an annual rate of 4 percent in the 
second quarter on hourly wage and benefit increases averaging 54 
percent annually last year businesses were able to restrain their 
labor cost increases to only 31 percent with a 38 percent 
increase in hourly compensation to workers 
roger brinner an economist for data resources inc of lexington 
mass said americans can expect to see a pattern in the near future 
in which productivity gains offset only a small portion of recent 
increases in wages 
it confirms that our core inflation rate has moved up locked 
in at 4 percent and probably is headed to 5 percent unless opec the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries dissolves brinner 
said 
manufacturers which account for onefourth of the nations 
economic output continue to fare much better that businesses 
generally in both improving their productivity and in keeping a lid 
on labor costs 
productivity in the nations factories rose at an annual rate of 
43 percent in the second quarter on a 65 percent boost in the 
volume of goods coming off assembly lines with only a 21 percent 
increase in hours worked 
factory wages and benefits rose at a slower 46 percent annual 
rate when compared with those of all workers in private industry 
enabling manufacturers to restrain their labor cost increases to 
only 03 percent in the third quarter and 07 percent over the past 
12 months 
after accounting for inflation factory workers have 03 percent 
less buying power for each hour of work than they had a year ago 
while workers in private industry in general have 07 percent more 
buying power the labor department said 
bruce steinberg an economist for merrill lynch said the 
manufacturing productivity gains are the payoff to the mergers 
acquisitions and leveraged buyouts that have wreaked havoc on some 
parts of the economy 
there were a lot of corporate bureaucracies that needed a lot 
of slimming he said as a result manufacturing is the most 
vital part of the us economy this year and its productivity growth 
in the 1980s has been superior to the three previous decades 
steinberg however noted that the export boom and wave of 
capital spending that has helped spur manufacturings rebound the 
past two years show signs of slowing down 
the commerce department for example reported wednesday that 
orders to us factories dropped 19 percent or by 44 billion in 
september after rising by 32 percent in august 
and orders for nondefense capital goods a key indicator of 
business investment plans fell by 10 percent to 349 billion for 
the month 
new home sales also fell a dramatic 78 percent in september 
the biggest decline in 16 months to seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 659000 units the commerce department said

the communists defeated the usbacked south vietnam government in 
april 1975 
maj dan trout a spokesman for the us pacific command said 
that since the paris accords the united states has received the 
identified remains of 196 missing personnel including 168 from

nearly 700 people arrested during last 
months riots were set free wednesday the eve of a national 
referendum destined to alter the countrys political landscape 
thursdays referendum if approved would introduce reforms 
promised by president chadli bendjedid after six days of october 
rioting left 176 people dead by official count 
more than 150 people were injured and 3000 arrested in violence 
prompted by unemployment shortages of food and housing and a 
declining standard of living in this north african nation of 25 
million people 
the government said 1500 people previously had been released 
including a large number of children picked up during the 
demonstrations throughout algeria a country about three times the 
size of texas 
earlier this week authorities said the 1500 still in prison 
would be freed wednesday by evening the justice ministry had 
announced several separate releases totaling 694 people a justice 
ministry spokesman reached by telephone said the rest would be let 
go during the day but could not say when 
algerias statecontrolled economy has been stricken by the 
decline in the price of oil the resource that accounts for about 95 
percent of algerias export earnings 
bendjedid has said algeria must change the way it is governed 
before it can enact the economic reforms needed to diversify the 
economy the referendum if approved would change 14 articles of 
the constitution 
algerias sole legal political party the national liberation 
front has controlled every aspect of national life since 
independence from france in 1962 
the goal of the reforms appears to be separating the party from 
the daytoday workings of the government by granting new powers to 
the countrys premier and making him answer for his policies to the 
national assembly the referendum if approved would change 14 
articles of the constitution 
voting in the referendum began in some farflung regions of 
southern algeria wednesday the rest of the countrys 12 million 
eligible voters go to the polls thursday 
political observers say bendjedids next move will be to open up 
parliamentary elections to nonparty candidates although probably 
not to other parties 
until now all candidates in local and national elections had to 
be nominated by the ruling party 
in a speech tuesday commemorating the algerian war of 
independence against france bendjedid said the series of reforms 
when taken together will assure the participation of all society 
without violence or anarchy 
the party is scheduled to meet nov 2728 to consider other 
unannounced reforms 
voters return to the polls twice next year first to approve the 
changes made by the party congress and then in february to elect a 
new president 
bendjedid is expected to be the only candidate on the 
presidential ballot 
in the past few months he has effectively neutralized his 
opponents within the partys old guard in a blow to hardliners 
saturday bendjedid fired mohamed cherif massaadia considered the 
no 2 man in the party and a leader of antireform forces

sales of new homes suffered their steepest 
plunge in more than a year in september a 78 percent decline that 
analysts blamed in part on the slowing economy 
the commerce department said sales of new singlefamily homes 
dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 659000 units in 
september down from an august sales pace of 715000 units 
it was only the third sales decline this year and the biggest 
monthly setback since a 109 percent drop in may 1987 
analysts said the decline had been expected given the fact that 
overall economic growth is slowing in the second half of the year 
sales of existing homes also fell during the month of september 
dropping 22 percent to an annual rate of 363 million units 
economists said both new and existing home sales had been 
bolstered in previous months by fears among potential buyers that 
interest rates would continue rising 
there was a lot of anticipatory buying going on in june july 
and august because of peoples expectations that interest rates 
would keep on rising said richard peach an economist with the 
mortgage bankers association 
peach said some of those sales actually were borrowed from the 
fall as people rushed to close deals before rates moved higher 
in fact mortgage rates have retreated somewhat in recent weeks 
as inflationary fears have eased in financial markets because of 
signs that economic growth is slowing 
the veterans administration announced monday it was cutting the 
rate on va mortgages by onehalf percentage point to 10 percent 
because of the recent trend toward lower rates surveys show lenders 
in some regions of the country are offering conventional 30year 
fixedrate loans at below 10 percent the first time they have 
dipped to those levels since last spring 
but economists said they did not expect rates to remain at these 
levels for long they predicted that further credit tightening moves 
expected by the federal reserve after the election would push rates 
higher 
peach said he expected fixedrate mortgages would hit 1175 
percent by late next year 
david seiders chief economist for the national association of 
home builders said while he saw rates rising as well he did not 
think the increase would be enough to send the housing industry into 
a slump 
instead he predicted new home sales would decline to about 
635000 units in 1989 down only about 5 percent from the level he 
is forecasting for this year 
the big september sales decline was accompanied by a jump in 
prices the median price for new homes was 118900 81 percent 
higher than the august sales price of 110000 the september median 
price which means half the homes sold for more and half for less 
was 112 percent higher than a year ago when the nationwide median 
was 106900 
the average sales price also rose climbing 45 percent to 
146300 in september 
the sales decline was led by a huge 278 percent plunge in sales 
in the south where sales were down to an annual rate of 216000 
units analysts were puzzled by the size of the decline predicting 
the figure might be revised upward in coming months 
sales in the northeast dropped 127 percent to an annual rate of 
89000 units the september sales pace was a steep 233 percent 
below the sales level of a year ago indicating analysts said that 
the sales boom has cooled in that region of the country 
sales in the west bucked the national trend rising by a sharp 
173 percent to an annual rate of 258000 units reflecting booming 
conditions in the california real estate markets 
sales in the midwest were up by a more modest 11 percent to an 
annual rate 96000 units

republican george bush said wednesday 
that if he is elected next week it would represent a mainstream 
mandate from voters who rejected a leftist political philosophy of 
democratic rival michael dukakis 
republican national chairman frank fahrenkopf who was traveling 
with the vice president through midwestern battleground states 
spoke openly of the prospects of bushs election by a landslide on 
nov 8 
the way it is going now there is that possibility he said 
cautioning that bush cannot afford to take any state or any public 
opinion poll for granted in the final days before the balloting 
addressing a boisterous rally of 5000 people in former president 
fords hometown bush poked fun at dukakis engaging in what he 
called a media blitz free media as the campaign drew to a close 
it seemed like he appeared on every television show except 
wheel of fortune bush said jokingly you see he was afraid 
that vanna might turn over the l word vanna white is a hostess on 
the popular tv game show 
at campaign rallies in michigan and illinois bush tried 
repeatedly to paste the l word or liberal tag on the democratic 
nominee and portray him as far removed from the mainstream of 
traditional american values 
i represent the mainstream the mainstream views and the 
mainstream values bush said if i win it will be a mainstream 
mandate thats what this election is about 
the gop nominee was introduced by ford who assailed dukakis an 
insult to the memory of harry truman and an image of george 
mcgovern walter mondale and jimmy carter three democrats who 
suffered big election losses to republican presidential candidates 
bush also made one of his rare public mentions of running mate 
sen dan quayle rind during the campaign 
he said quayle like steel had been tempered by fire my young 
running mate has been through the fire and his head is up and his 
chin is high bush said 
earlier in the affluent chicago suburb of prairie view ill 
bush told a lively rally of 4000 people in a high school gymnasium 
that he had heard the voice of america in his campaign travels 
and that he had big dreams about america 
he said a great divide separated his and dukakis views 
which he characterized as way out on the left side of the polical 
spectrum 
bush said he shared the values of the working men and women in 
this country 
noting that the students in the audience were receiving an 
outstanding education bush promised greater support for the 
federal head start program for needy preschool children 
bush campaign aides were heartened by chicago newspapers polls 
showing him with a lead of six to nine percentage points over 
dukakis in illinois which has 24 electoral votes and by another 
survey indicating he was ahead by six points in michigan which has 
20 electoral votes 
fahrenkopf said daily gop tracking polls showed that for the past 
few weeks dukakis could claim between 35 percent and 38 percent of 
the vote 
there is a base democratic vote of 40 percent fahrenkopf 
said and dukakis had been below that for some time 
fahrenkopf did not use the word landslide but said if bushs 
standing holds up across the country a landslide victory is 
possible 
spokeswoman sheila tate said the campaign was also satisified 
with the decision of the washington post not to endorse either 
candidate 
she said wednesays rallies were an effort to shore it up and 
fire up the troops

three vacant and dilapidated apartment buildings 
said to be havens for drug dealers have been demolished marking the 
end of a oneyear campaign by dallas police 
bulldozers demolished a 24unit complex a 10unit building and a 
duplex tuesday 
we started trying to do something about these places a year ago 
today said lt david goelden a police patrol supervisor 
theyve been a haven for drug dealers to smoke and sell their 
dope we cant keep closing our eyes to this he added 
joe johnson who owns 100 apartment units in the same 
neighborhood said he too was happy to see the buildings 
demolished because of the drug traffic 
johnson said it took repeated calls from him neighbors and 
police officers to persuade the city to order the buildings 
demolished 
demolition of dilapidated vacant structures that provide cover 
for drug dealers is a tactic increasingly being used to combat 
drugrelated crime in other cities including houston miami new 
york and los angeles 
goelden conceded that tearing down the residences might only push 
the dealers to other locations but he said police also will work on 
those places

donald trump claims hes not interested in the 
sears tower and the japanese are wary of owning anything so 
symbolic of america but theyd all be there if a public auction 
were held says a man who wants to wield the gavel 
real estate auctioneer joel zegart is proposing that sears 
roebuck and co sell the worlds tallest building at auction 
claiming that the nations largest retailer would get the best price 
that way 
sears announced monday it would sell its famed 110story 
headquarters tower as part of a corporate restructuring designed to 
boost profits the 14yearold building which rises 1450 feet 
above the downtown loop has been valued at up to 18 billion 
even those who say theyre not interested like new york real 
estate magnate trump several japanese real estate firms and jmb 
realty corp which owns water tower place the citys glitzy 
downtown shopping complex are just playing coy he believes 
i think its a smokescreen zegart president of jbs amp 
associates inc said wednesday of the many denials among those seen 
as the most likely bidders for the building 
i think a lot of people are interested and they just arent 
showing their cards yet 
sears spokesman douglas fairweather said the company had received 
a number of inquiries following its announcement but he 
wouldnt reveal the identities of the interested parties 
nor would fairweather comment on the auction idea 
i dont want to laugh on the record he said 
fairweather said the sale which is being handled by goldman 
sachs amp co in conjunction with sears own coldwell banker real 
estate and dean witter reynolds financial units would be negotiated 
privately with selected prospective buyers who would be invited to 
submit bids 
the skyscraper would continue to serve as corporate headquarters 
for sears although the 8000employee sears merchandise group would 
be moved to smaller less expensive facilities over the next several 
years leaving only about 600 sears workers in the tower 
zegart whose firm specializes in auctions of large investment 
properties said a public auction open to all would generate 
tremendous interest and result in a sale at the highest price sears 
could hope to receive 
he said he would start the bidding at 800 million 
zegart comparing the oneofakind sears tower to the mona lisa 
said an auction of the building could be as lucrative as the 1987 
auction of vincent van goghs sunflowers was to the seller in 
that case 
japans yasuda fire and marine insurance co stunned the art 
world when it paid 40 million for sunflowers in march 1987 
later in the year an unidentified bidder paid even more for another 
van gogh 
the sears tower is a building that youll never see reproduced 
again zegart said youre buying a piece of chicago when you 
buy the sears tower its the gem of the downtown its history 
its a landmark its known around the world 
several japanese firms say those are precisely the qualities that 
make them wary 
buying such a building is not the same as buying 
sunflowers tokyobased investment analyst masahiko muranaka 
told the chicago tribune this is like buying a piece of americas 
heart 
the trump organization which was also seen as a likely bidder 
for the tower is not interested in the sears building said 
spokeswoman norma foerderer 
and neither is jmb one of the nations largest realestate 
invesment firms said spokeswoman marion jack

orders to us factories for manufactured goods 
fell 19 percent in september reflecting the volatility of demand 
for jet aircraft the government said wednesday 
the commerce department said orders for durable and nondurable 
goods fell to 2226 billion in september 44 billion below the 
august level 
through the summer factory orders each month have been buffeted 
by rising and falling levels of demand for aircraft august orders 
had risen a sharp 32 percent because of a jump in the 
transportation category which includes aircraft 
without the volatile transportation sector total orders would 
have risen a more modest 09 percent in august and would have 
declined 05 percent in september 
the manufacturing sector has been one of the stars of the economy 
this year as us factories have benefited from a boom in export 
sales however many economists believe this strength is beginning 
to ebb and they are predicting slower overall economic growth for 
next year 
but commerce undersecretary robert ortner said that even with the 
orders decline in september the backlog of unfilled orders rose 
indicating production should remain strong in coming months 
a onemonth drop in orders after such a strong expansion is not 
very meaningful ortner said the order books are still 
expanding and there is no better incentive for increasing production 
and employment than a fat order book 
in september transportation orders fell 98 percent to 313 
billion orders for aircraft dropped by 115 percent while orders 
for military ships and tanks a smaller category also declined 
sharply 
the overall defense category fell by 125 percent to 7 billion 
in september but some analysts suggested that this was a 
statistical quirk related to the close of the governments fiscal 
year they predicted defense orders would resume rising in coming 
months 
discounting defense total orders would have dropped by 15 
percent the biggest setback in the civilian category since a 29 
percent drop in january 1987 
the key category of nondefense capital goods considered a good 
indicator of industry investment plans fell 10 percent to 349 
billion but still remained 18 percent higher than a year ago 
this sector has provided much of the momentum for economic growth 
this year as industries have boosted investment to meet increased 
demand from an export boom 
orders for durable goods items expected to last three or mores 
years fell 32 percent to 1189 billion this was a slight 
improvement from a preliminary report last week that had put the 
decline at 41 percent 
orders for nondurable goods dipped 05 percent to 1037 
billion reflecting declines in orders for chemicals and petroleum 
products 
shipments of manufactured goods dipped a slight 01 percent in 
september to 2214 billion

thousands of iranians chanting death to 
america rallied wednesday in the compound of the former us 
embassy in tehran on the eve of the anniversary of its seizure by 
militant students a news agency said 
followers of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini stormed the embassy on 
nov 4 1979 and held 52 us diplomats hostage for 444 days 
the rally was held two days early because this years anniversary 
falls on friday the moslem sabbath irans official islamic 
republic news agency reported 
irna said the demonstrators chanted slogans against britain the 
soviet union and israel and burned an effigy of uncle sam and the 
us flag in the compound of what iranians call laneh jassoussi 
or the den of spies 
on sunday irans parliament declared nov 4 the day of the 
campaign against global arrogance the iranians phrase for the 
united states 
that date is also important in irans revolutionary calendar on 
nov 4 1963 shah mohammad reza pahlavi exiled khomeini and on that 
date 15 years later hundreds of the shahs opponents were killed or 
wounded in tehran when troops fired on demonstrators 
the news agency said wednesdays rally was led by religious and 
parliamentary figures the rally began at tehran university 
demonstrators then marched to the walled compound in central tehran 
leaders of the demonstration read out an eightpoint resolution 
declaring that us support for the shahs prowestern government 
the freezing of iranian assets worth billions of dollars in the 
united states and washingtons antiiranian policies will never be 
forgotten 
the resolution accused the united states of aiding iraq in the 
8yearold gulf war and declared that us naval attacks on iranian 
vessels in the gulf before the aug 20 ceasefire and particularly 
the shooting down of an iranian airliner july 3 killing all 290 
people aboard will be remembered 
parts of the wreckage of the iran air airbus a300 were displayed 
during the demonstration irna reported

despite the pending shutdown of the sole 
supplier of a fiber used in space shuttle rocket nozzles the maker 
of the shuttle motors said wednesday at least 10 more shuttles can 
be launched as planned 
we have enough material on hand or on order for 11 flights out 
of our current contract of 13 morton thiokol inc aerospace group 
spokesman rocky raab said from ogden utah but the number will be 
10 now since weve flown discovery 
the 10 flights are scheduled to be made through december 1989 
raab said 
morton thiokol and other aerospace contractors along with nasa 
and the department of defense were talking with avtex fibers inc 
officials said avtex based in valley forge pa announced this 
week it will close its plant here thursday 
ive never had a job where they do you like this no warning 
no nothing you find out on your own said deanna green who said 
she learned about the plants pending closing monday from friends 
the move would put 1300 people out of work and choke off the 
only supply of a rayon fiber used in rocket nozzles 
practically every project we have uses it in the nozzle raab 
said its safe to say billions of dollars of projects 
other morton thiokol projects that use the rayon fiber include 
the small icbm the peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missile 
and the harm and standard tactical missiles raab said morton 
thiokol was trying to determine wednesday the overall impact to each 
of its government contracts if the plant does close 
were still trying to pull all that together raab said the 
fiber earmarked for shuttle nozzles will not be transferred to any 
of the defense rockets he said 
nasa the military and aerospace contractors initially found it 
difficult to determine how much of the fiber is on hand because it 
is handled by three more layers of contractors who weave it and 
treat it for heat resistance before its formed into rocket nozzles 
nasa officials have said the talks with avtex are aimed at 
ensuring the supply of the fiber the companys chairman john n 
gregg has not returned repeated phone calls from the associated 
press over the last several days 
a nasa spokesman at the marshall space flight center in 
huntsville ala confirmed wednesday that talks were under way but 
said he could provide no details 
i really dont know what the discussions are leading to dave 
drachlis said i know the government and avtex are discussing 
options and looking at what could be done 
another nasa spokesman jerry berg has said keeping avtexs 
rayon fiber operation in business was one possibility officials 
could be exploring 
avtex spokesman john kelly in new york has said the front royal 
plant is the only avtex facility equipped to make the fiber the 
necessary equipment could not be moved to avtexs plant in 
lewistown pa which the company is keeping in operation kelly 
said

a supreme court judge who owns shares in 
union carbide corps indian subsidiary withdrew wednesday from 
hearing an appeal on whether the firm should pay interim relief to 
victims of the bhopal gas leak 
i thought it was proper to let the court know that i hold 
shares and i also thought it proper to withdraw myself from the 
case justice madhukar hiralal kania told the associated press 
i wanted to withdraw because something may be said later he 
said 
he was replaced by justice nd ojha 
the supreme court is hearing an appeal of a lower courts order 
directing the danbury connbased company to pay interim relief 
more than 3100 people died and 20000 were seriously affected by 
toxic methyl isocyanate gas that leaked from a pesticide plant in 
the central indian city of bhopal on dec 3 1984 
the plant belonged to an indian subsidiary of union carbide 
i was told that my holding shares has nothing to do with the 
case but i thought i should not be a party to it case kania 
said by telephone 
he refused to say how many shares he holds but press trust of 
india news agency said it was small the agency did not give 
specifics 
outside the court in new delhi about 100 victims silently 
protested the courts decision to hear the appeal they sat behind 
huge placards showing dead and ailing victims of the gas leak 
in 1986 the indian government filed a 3 billion civil suit 
against union carbide claiming the leak was caused by negligence 
union carbide said the disaster was a result of sabotage by a 
disgruntled employee 
a district court hearing the suit last year ordered union carbide 
to pay 269 million to victims of the disaster as interim relief 
the company appealed to the high court of madhya pradesh state 
which lowered the payment to 192 million 
a fivejudge panel supreme court panel headed by chief justice 
raghunandan s pathak on tuesday began hearing appeals by union 
carbide against the payment and by the indian government against the 
lowering of the amount

campus rallies or battled police wednesday to demand the arrest of 
former president chun doohwan on corruption charges 
national police director cho jongsuk issued a statement warning 
against the student activism and said authorities would harshly 
deal with anybody found involved in illegal rallies and 
demonstrations

antigovernment protests in seoul and elsewhere no arrests were 
reported 
antigovernment demonstrations have been escalating in recent 
weeks radicals have threatened to raid chuns house in seoul on 
thursday national students day 
about 4000 police surrounded chuns house and began checking 
passersby

squads to assault chuns house with firebombs and homemade 
explosives major street protests were planned near chuns house

his predecessor 
local newspapers quoting unnamed senior government officials 
said some of chuns family members might be arrested on corruption 
charges before roh returns home from the overseas trip nov 14

reluctant to divulge alleged corruption involving chun his family 
members and associates

since they were classmates at korea military academy in the 1950s 
roh succeeded chun who stepped down at the end of a sevenyear term 
in february

and involvement in financial and other scandals one of his

arab nations saw the apparent victory of 
rightwing parties in israels elections as a setback for peace but 
egypt said wednesday it will continue seeking a path to stability in 
the middle east 
the swing to the right in israel gave prime minister yitzhak 
shamir and his likud bloc the chance to form a government with the 
aid of small religious parties which gained seats in the election 
likud and the rival labor party have been in a fractious national 
unity coalition since 1984 
jordans foreign minister taher masri told the associated 
press we think such a government will be a blow to the efforts of 
peace especially at this time when everyone the two superpowers 
the world at large is becoming more flexible about reaching the 
basis for a peaceful settlement 
before tuesdays election jordan egypt and the palestine 
liberation organization had expressed indirect support for labor 
led by foreign minister shimon peres and its leftist allies 
peres has said he would accept an international conference on the 
middle east which arab nations demand and is willing to trade some 
occupied territory for peace shamir opposes a conference and vows 
never to give up the west bank and gaza strip which israel captured 
from jordan and israel in 1967 
plo leader yasser arafat said the election result makes no 
difference and the palestinian uprising in israels occupied 
territories would continue 
there is no difference in my opinion between peres and 
shamir said arafat who was in rome for a meeting with italian 
foreign minister giulio andreotti shamir is using the iron fist 
and defense minister yithzak rabin with peres is using the same 
iron fist and dont forget that during the whole last period we are 
facing the two parties in the same cabinet 
a commentary distributed by wafa the plo news agency called the 
election result a fatal blow for peace and declared we expect 
more intransigence hate and terrorism with a likud government 
said kenaan a west bank businessman who supports the plo 
declared its obvious israelis dont want peace but we will hit 
back the moderate voice in the palestinian camp is finished 
hanna siniora editor of the proplo daily al fajr said the 
palestinians will now only intensify their efforts to end the 
occupation and achieve national rights 
palestinians living in the occupied territories began a rebellion 
against israeli rule dec 8 1987 that has cost the lives of 10 
israelis and more than 300 palestinians the election focused on the 
uprising and how to achieve peace with the arabs 
the likud program is built on illusions said ahmed 
abdulrahman a spokesman at plo headquarters in tunisia it 
promises israelis both security and the continuation of the 
occupation while the facts have proved that israel will not have 
peace as long as it continues the occupation 
foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid of egypt said in cairo 
however that the outcome represents the will of the israeli 
voters and it is natural that we deal with any new government 
they choose egypt also is anxious to emphasize the need for action 
to carry on with the peace process to achieve stability in the 
region 
egypt under the leadership of president anwar sadat is the only 
arab nation to have made a peace treaty with israel the treaty was 
signed in 1979 and assassins who opposed it killed sadat in 1981 
syrias state radio said the results of the elections are not 
in favor of just and lasting peace in the middle east nor are they 
in favor of settling the differences between likud and labor on the 
international peace conference and on the future of the occupied 
territories 
mohammed milhem of the plo executive committee said in amman a 
likud government would be even tougher on protesters in the occupied 
lands where the plo hopes to establish a palestinian state and 
reaction to the bloodshed might bring peace closer 
the former mayor of halhoul in the west bank who was deported in 
1980 said wednesday with shamir i think there may be more 
chances for peaceful settlement than with peres hes going to 
escalate hes going to kill more people deport more people and 
the international community might do something about it 
the government of shamir is an evil but this evil may do more 
good than peres milhem said 
many jordanians spent the night tuned to israels radio and 
television for election results 
among them was carlos dimes who represented bethlehem in 
jordans parliament before king hussein severed administrative ties 
to the occupied territories last summer 
the palestinians should keep on fighting to win the intefadeh 
and never wait for the israeli and us elections to achieve 
that for them he said

george bush would use the power of the 
presidency to push for federal legislation banning discrimination 
against people with the aids virus the bush campaigns top domestic 
affairs adviser said wednesday 
deborah steelmans assertion was an extension of bushs own 
support for the white house aids commissions recommendation last 
summer calling for a federal antidiscrimination law as the 
foundation for a more aggressive fight against the disease 
meeting with a small group of reporters steelman was reminded 
that conservative republicans particularly sen jesse helms of 
north carolina and rep william e dannemeyer were successful in 
blocking antidiscrimination provisions during the justended 100th 
congress 
would bush use the power of the white house to push the issue in 
congress she was asked 
sure she said thats the name of the game 
she said bush and dannemeyer have discussed the issue and do 
disagree fairly heartily 
steelman said confidentiality laws regarding aids testing need to 
remain a matter for states largely because they are so closely 
linked to insurance regulation and other state functions 
but since discrimination against people infected with the aids 
virus or hiv is the down side to breached confidentiality 
she said an overarching federal ban against such discrimination is 
needed 
bush held a private dinner with surgeon general c everett koop 
and national institutes of health aids chief anthony fauci a few 
days before making a point on the campaign trail of backing the aids 
commissions call for antidiscrimination legislation 
neither president reagan nor any other top white house official 
has taken such a position 
the premise of public and private health officials in backing 
strong antidiscrimination laws is that people likely to be carrying 
the virus will not submit to the aids test for fear the results 
would become public and that that will make the epidemic harder to 
track and fight 
one of the commissions main criticisms of reagan administration 
health policies was that budget planning for aids research and 
education was filtered through the normal bureaucratic process that 
often results in requests originated by scientists being watered 
down before they reach the white house 
asked about the stance a president bush would take in dealing 
with government health officials requests for ammunition to fight 
aids steelman said he probably will talk to them personally

the supreme court hearing a case involving a 
child beaten and crippled by his father was told wednesday that 
suits against government social agencies are constitutional if 
caseworkers fail to act to protect someone they know is in peril 
attorney donald james sullivan asked to court to uphold a suit by 
the mother of nineyearold joshua deshaney who was beaten so 
severely by his father that he can only make awkward movements and 
guttural sounds 
sullivan told the court that winnebago county wis social 
welfare officials deprived the youth of his due process rights when 
they refused to help the child five years ago even while 
knowing he was in immediate need of medical care 
the court which took the case under advisement was asked to 
decide whether the costitution permits suits against social agencies 
for such alleged gross negligence 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals last year threw out the 
suit by melody deshaney of cheyenne wyo against the winnebago 
county department of social services and two of its employees 
mark j mingo representing the social agency said the 
constitution would not support suits that subjected local 
governments to massive new areas of exposure 
and he said that the job of social workers would be almost 
impossible if they could be sued every time they make the wrong 
decision 
social workers operate on the razors edge mingo said 
they must respond to the constitutional right of parents in 
management of their child 
he said a social worker must walk a fine line to prevent the 
door from being slammed in her face to prevent future involvement 
sullivan said he was not arguing the state has a broad 
constitutional mandate to be all things to all people 
a governments affirmative constitutional duty he said came 
only when there was extensive danger to the child and abundant 
actual knowledge by the government knowledge he said was present 
in this case 
if the parents rights are recognized why should the rights of 
the child be less recognized he asked 
justice sandra day oconnor said it seemed sullivans argument 
would have a real deterrent effect on state agencies 
sullivan argued that its okay for a social worker to guess 
wrong but he contended joshuas caseworker was so keenly aware of 
his danger that she once worried that she would pick up the phone 
one day and learn the boy was dead 
asked by justice john paul stevens when did the constitutional 
violation occur sullivan said it was when the agency allowed 
joshua to return home to his father after a threeday hospital stay 
in 1983 for suspected child abuse 
mingo said the child went back because no hard evidence of abuse 
was discovered and the law required that the boy be sent home 
chief justice william h rehnquist told sullivan i dont see 
how you turn around the limitations on the state to a duty on the 
state 
the boys father randy deshaney was convicted of felony battery 
and child abuse and sentenced to two consecutive twoyear prison 
terms he served about two years and eight months before he was 
released in september 1987 
joshua remains in custody of the county and has no use of his 
legs or one arm and can only make awkward movements with one hand 
the 7th circuit in dismissing the suit said if the 
defendants though blameworthy did not cause joshuas injuries 
they cannot be said to have deprived him of his liberty 
the court said it was unlikely that the caseworker assigned 
to joshua did the boy any good at all but it is most unlikely 
that it did him any harm she merely failed to protect him from his 
bestial father

about half the worlds hungriest people 350 
million of them live in india and bangladesh but 140 million of 
them are on land with great promise of more farm production in the 
1990s a food policy official said wednesday 
john a mellor director of the international food policy 
research institute said experts now know how to get more crops out 
of the valleys of the ganges and brahmaputra rivers where many of 
the worlds poorest and hungriest people are concentrated 
twenty years ago it was premature to talk about eliminating 
hunger and poverty in the world mellor a former chief economist 
for the us agency for international development told reporters 
now we have a base for doing it 
mellor said it would be a longterm project 15 to 20 years 
based on developing improved varieties of grains and soybeans as 
well as better roads bridges and other public works 
improving farming will have a multiplier effect on the growth of 
incomes because farmers use most of their increased earnings in ways 
that create more jobs he said the faster agriculture grows the 
faster its share of the economy declines he explained 
mellor pointed to the example of the united states where only 2 
percent to 3 percent of the people are now in farming but production 
of both food and industrial goods has increased tremendously since 
the days when most americans were farmers 
to end poverty people must get jobs in industry he said 
mellor said farming in the third world is dependent increasingly 
on the market and less on government control leftwing governments 
help distribute land in the third world but do not understand 
farming he said 
karl marx was a city boy mellor explained 
he calculated that of the 700 million undernourished people in 
the world 350 million live in southeast asia 137 million in 
africa 76 million in china 72 million in latin america 34 million 
in the near east and 31 million in east asia and the pacific 
mellors comments were based on a report he will deliver friday 
to the consultative group on international agricultural research an 
organization of 13 organizations coordinated by the world bank

death after allegedly being forcefed a ginger cake was held 
wednesday on 50000 bail pending a hearing in the case 
the death of phenix smith was colorados 19th reported 
childabuse fatality in 1988 one short of the record number 
reported in 1982 and equaled in 1984 with two months to go in the 
year 
its been a real bad year said jane beveridge administrator 
of the states child protection program 
phenix died in childrens hospital on saturday police reported 
she apparently choked to death on a large amount of food and 
also showed signs of possible sexual abuse 
phenixs stepmother 31yearold beverly smith was accused of 
forcefeeding the girl as a punishment for sampling a ginger cake

a soviet sailor captured 34 years ago by 
taiwan said wednesday he enjoys living here and denied he had been 
tortured 
i have made many friends taiwan is prosperous and people here 
are rich i like this place vsevolod vladihirovich lopatyuk said 
on an evening television show speaking in chinese and russian 
in an interview with the militaryrun china television system he 
said the taiwanese government had granted him and three colleagues 
asylum and provided them with money housing and entertainment 
lopatyuk said president lee tenghui had approved his request to 
become a taiwan resident and he soon will start teaching russian at 
a language center 
lopatyuk 60 lives in a secluded compound protected by guards in 
ilan a fishing village about 18 miles southwest of taipei 
he said he missed his parents and that although they are in the 
soviet union they live in my heart forever 
lopatyuk denied charges by the other sailors that they had been 
captured and tortured in prison 
when the other sailors vladimir sablin boris pianov and 
vladimir kniga returned to moscow in august they told reporters 
they had lived in horror during their long stay in taiwan 
they were made to look for days at hot white electric bulbs 
wild dances of the prison guards on prostrate bodies of the 
prisoners whose feet and arms joints were squeezed tight the 
offical soviet news agency tass reported 
lopatyuk denied the tass report and said the four stayed in the 
compound together and were treated nicely 
the four were among the crew of the tanker tuapse that was 
sailing for mainland china with a load of kerosene when taiwanese 
authorities seized it on june 23 1954 
taiwan officials have said 29 soviet crewmen were released in 
1955 and by 1958 nine more had left for the united states and 
brazil after being granted asylum in those countries 
lopatyuk said he and his three colleagus had decided to stay in 
taiwan after us officials rejected their immigration requests in 
1954 he said he had no idea why the three wanted to leave taiwan 
after 34 years 
taiwan officials said the government respected the sailors will 
and helped them fly back to moscow 
the nationalist government which fled to taiwan in 1949 after 
losing a civil war to communists on the mainland maintains a 
staunch anticommunist policy taiwan has no diplomatic relations 
with the soviet union

yugoslavias leaders averted a civil war last 
month and the country now faces prospects of less communism and more 
democracy accompanied by painful economic adjustment the president 
of slovenia one of the nations six republics said wednesday 
two weeks ago you would have asked when does the civil war 
come but the crisis was defused by decisions taken in late 
october by the national communist partys central committee the 
national assembly and others said janez stanovnik 
stanovnik described recent developments to a national press club 
gathering and later at a meeting with secretary of state george 
shultz a longtime acquaintance he is on an unofficial visit to see 
his son in philadelphia and attend fridays board meeting of the 
international management institute in new york 
stanovik said demonstrations fueled by inflation and serbian 
nationalism were threatening decentralized yugoslavia with civil war 
the prospect of ethnic disturbances in the republic of bosnia a 
fragile community of moslems christians and members of the orthodox 
faith prompted him and leaders of other republics to act through the 
federal party on matters normally reserved to regional authorities 
he said 
stanovnik a longtime leader of the ruling yugoslav communist 
league and a contemporary of the late marshall josip broz tito the 
founder of modern yugoslavia said he realized that if this thing 
will come to bosnia and bosnia disintegrated there will be 
bloodshed it was this that made me profoundly afraid we are truly 
on the edge of civil war 
stanovnik said he joined leaders of montenegro and others at the 
central committee to tell the serbians please dont cross this 
line which i thought we should in all friendship say to our 
brothers 
the result was a nonconfidence vote against serbian politburo 
member dusan ckrebic widely regarded as a rebuff from the whole 
of yugoslavia to serbian communist party chief slobodan milosevic 
over fanning ethnic tensions stanovnik said 
with this action i think the whole situation in yugoslavia has 
changed and we have thus made a crucial start toward reform he 
said 
stanovnik said his differences with milosevic were in political 
strategy while in economic reform comrade milosevic is as liberal 
as i am 
constitutional amendments subsequently approved by the national 
assembly actually mean deideologizing the yugoslav economy 
with such changes as freeing private enterprise and business to 
operate in a free market said stanovnik 
the transformation carries essential political conditions he 
said including human rights free press free expression free 
thought and eventually direct elections 
stanovnik said the communist party whose members make up only 10 
percent of the population must step down from directly 
interfering in government affairs and must become rather a party of 
movement and not of direct government 
this idea was by and large endorsed by the yugoslav party at 
the recent central committee session maybe not as a 
enthusiastically as in slovenia but enough to warrant moderate 
optimism for the future he said 
stanovnik said the slovenians also won adoption of their proposal 
for reduced military spending on the premise that eastwest detente 
has revived he gave no figures 
yugoslavia will have to cut social services and it will be very 
painful he said because the country has been providing a 
socialist heaven of good schools hospitals and pensions without 
producing enough to pay for them

television journalists at the british broadcasting 
corp voted wednesday to join a oneday strike protesting a 
government ban on broadcasting interviews with members of the irish 
republican army 
the nov 10 stoppage by the national union of journalists 
250member branch at bbc television center could black out hourly 
news bulletins and current affairs programs 
the union which called for the strike said journalists at the 
bbc world service the worldwide radio network also will strike and 
that bbc locals across britain have voted overwhelmingly in favor of 
protests ranging from partial stoppages to a full 24hour walkout 
independent television news which is part of britains 
commercial independent television network will vote later in the 
week on whether to strike the 150member itn union local voted 
unanimously against a strike at a meeting last week the union said 
the public should realise this has nothing to do with a defence 
of terrorism said john foster organizer for the estimated 4000 
television and radio journalists in the union it is opposition to 
a government attempt to censor broadcasting 
broadcast journalists in northern ireland would not be asked to 
strike because many of them feared the strike could be seen as 
supporting terrorism foster said 
on oct 20 the government of prime minister margaret thatcher 
imposed an immediate ban on broadcast interviews with members of the 
outlawed ira and 10 other militant groups in northern ireland and 
their sympathizers 
the ban was imposed under laws governing the two radio and tv 
networks the publicly financed bbc and the commercially funded 
independent television 
it followed an upsurge in killings by the mainly roman catholic 
ira which is fighting to end british rule in northern ireland and 
unite the protestantdominated province with the catholic irish 
republic under socialist rule 
radio and television can still report in indirect speech the 
views of members of the affected organizations and their supporters

the defense department considered one of the 
biggest us offenders in its reliance on a chemical that depletes 
the earths ozone layer formally joined a governmentindustry task 
force on wednesday with a pledge to help find alternatives 
the department in a brief statement said it would support a 
threestep program aimed at finding and testing alternatives to 
chlorofluorocarbon compounds or cfcs by april 1989 
the task force is being led by the environmental protection 
agency but includes representatives of the major companies that 
produce cfcs electronics producers who rely heavily on the chemical 
and various military agencies 
one of the biggest uses of cfc compounds is as a solvent for 
cleaning electronic components circuit boards and materials that 
are to be welded together the compound also is used to clean metal 
parts in a variety of weapon systems 
in the united states in 1986 150 million pounds of cfc113 
were used for prepping printed wire assemblies metal cleaning and 
precision cleaning the pentagon said 
the armed forces and companies supplying equipment to them 
accounted for nearly half of that according to some estimates 
the pentagon said the task force first would quantify the defense 
departments cleanliness standards then set up procedures for 
testing and evaluating the effectiveness of alternative chemicals 
those first two phases will be completed early next year the 
pentagon continued 
the third and final phase will be the actual testing of 
alternatives and current plans are to complete testing of 
alternative materials by april 1989 the statement said 
the task force includes at least 23 corporations including such 
cfc producers as du pont and alliedsignal electronics makers such 
as the digital equipment corp atampt and magnavox and such huge 
defense contractors as general dynamics honeywell hughes aircraft 
ibm texas instruments and litton industries the pentagon said 
this program is a result of the protocol on substances that 
deplete the ozone layer which was signed by the united states in 
montreal canada last year the pentagon concluded 
that protocol or international treaty contains a pledge by the 
worlds major producing nations to reduce by 50 percent their output 
of cfcs by 1998 
the ozone layer reduces the amount of cancercausing ultraviolet 
rays from the sun that reach the earths surface the cfc compounds 
normally inert rise through the atmosphere to the ozone layer 
where those same ultraviolet rays break them apart and free 
ozonedestroying chlorine 
according to scientific studies the longlived cfc compounds 
have since about 1960 destroyed 25 percent of the ozone layer the 
epa estimates that every percent decrease in ozone results in 43000 
additional skin cancer cases in the united states currently there 
are about 500000 cases a year 
besides their use as cleaning solvents cfcs are used as 
refrigeration fluids and plastic foam blowing agents many countries 
still permit their use as aerosol propellants a use banned in the 
united states in 1978

preliminary results of a study of 20 us colleges 
suggest about three out of every thousand college students is 
infected with the aids virus according to federal health officials 
who caution that final numbers may be either higher or lower 
the national centers for disease control along with the american 
college health association is testing 1000 anonymous blood samples 
from each of 20 us colleges as part of a family of surveys to 
assess the prevalence of the aids virus in the us population cdc 
spokeswoman anne simms said wednesday 
the survey is not expected to be completed until february 
1989 she said until february we really dont have any kind of 
meaningful estimate of hiv human immunodeficiency virus infection 
on college campuses 
about 5000 of those samples have been tested she said showing 
a rate of about three cases per 1000 college students or 03 
percent she said she did not know where the 5000 samples came 
from whether they were from all 20 colleges in the study or just 
some of them 
this number was not unexpected ms simms said we knew 
that there was hiv infection among this population this just 
confirms what we already knew and in fact the final results in 
february may be higher or lower we dont have any real way of 
knowing 
by comparison other studies indicate infection rates of four out 
of 1000 prisoners or 04 percent 
nationwide researchers believe the infection rate is between 04 
percent and 06 percent or perhaps 15 million people the 
government has estimated that 20 percent to 30 percent of those 
infected with the aids virus will develop aids within five years 
although there are differing theories on this 
cdc reported last week that 76670 cases have been reported since 
june 1981 with 43027 fatalities 
some medical experts worry that most if not virtually all of 
those infected with the virus will eventually become sick and die 
because of evidence that the disease has a long incubation period 
the only thing we can show from these preliminary results is 
that there is hiv infection on college campuses college students 
are not immune from aids ms simms said 
the preliminary results come on the heels of letter in september 
from assistant us secretary for health dr robert e windom to 
university presidents and deans focusing on the danger to students 
windom said that onefifth of the reported aids cases currently 
occur among people 20 to 29 years old 
since the average incubation period for aids is seven 
years or longer its clear that many of the 14000 patients in this 
group were high school or college age at the time of their 
infection windom said in the letter 
ms simms said the preliminary results reinforce health 
officials advice that people engaging in highrisk behavior should 
change their ways 
aids is carried in blood and other bodily fluids and is most 
commonly transmitted by sexual contact or by shared contaminated 
drug needles eightyseven percent of all reported cases in the 
united states have occurred among homosexual or bisexual males or 
intravenous drug abusers

advanced soviet fighterbombers 
recently brought into southern afghanistan have been used this week 
to attack guerrilla positions around kandahar the countrys 
secondlargest city 
waves of mig27s could be seen operating south of the city 
monday and guerrillas reported heavy bombing earlier at their 
positions several miles east of the airport 
guerrilla leaders and the us state department said last week 
that mig27s had been seen in afghanistan and washington warned the 
soviets about escalating the war 
the state department also said tuesday that scud missiles capable 
of reaching pakistan 120 miles away had appeared in kabul 
afghanistans capital 
kabul radio said the missiles were to be used late tuesday but 
did not say where 
in moscow the soviet news agency tass said afghan government 
forces fired a powerful missile at a guerrilla base near the 
pakistan border maj gen mz sulemal was quoted as saying the 
target was a store of antiaircraft missiles groundtoground 
missiles mines and shells near marulgad in nangarhar province 
a spokesman for pakistans foreign ministry said wednesday the 
introduction of ss1 scud missiles in afghanistan is a serious 
violation of the geneva accords and represents a new and grave 
threat to peace and security of the region 
under a unmediated agreement signed april 14 in geneva the 
soviet union is to withdraw all its troops from afghanistan by feb 
5 1989 
moslem insurgents began fighting in afghanistan after a communist 
coup in april 1978 and the red army entered the country in december 
1979 an estimated 115000 soviet military personnel were in 
afghanistan the geneva agreement was signed 
half the soviet soldiers are gone but un observers assigned to 
monitor the agreement said the latest developments cast doubt on 
moscows commitment to complete the withdrawal 
officials in kabul call the scud missiles the latest addition to 
their arsenal but guerrillas previously have described longrange 
missiles resembling scuds 
sovietmade frog missiles with a shorter range of 30 miles were 
reported in barikot a northeastern garrison town after guerrillas 
captured it last summer 
fighting at kandahar has been heaviest around the airport about 
12 miles from downtown guerrillas said the first mig27 attacks 
occurred oct 2427 on their positions east of the airport near tor 
kotan village 
a guerrilla source in quetta pakistan said the aircraft were 
first spotted about oct 19 at a sovietafghan air base at shindand 
in western afghanistan 
insurgents in the area also reported seeing new helicopter 
gunships that were smaller faster and more maneuverable than 
earlier models but could not identify the type the source said 
those gunships covered roads connecting kandahar to kabul and 
herat during the last week in october said ismail galaini of the 
national islamic front of afghanistan guerrilla group

the soviet unions chief censor told izvestia 
wednesday that the time of the cult of secrecy has passed but 
that his agency wont be disappearing from the lives of soviet 
journalists 
the article in the government newspaper was vladimir boldirevs 
first published interview 
boldirev head of the chief directorate for the protection of 
government secrets in the press or glavlit said his country still 
has secrets and any thought that his agency is no longer needed is 
just a wish not reality 
he said however that restrictions on the press have eased 
considerably and that the list of banned topics has shrunk by a 
third izvestia reported 
boldirev said that about 7500 previously banned soviet books 
have been restored to library shelves and most foreign publications 
will soon join them 
glavlit still holds onto 400 soviet books it considers 
pornographic or likely to incite ethnic strife and these remain in 
special repositories he said 
the soviet press now is allowed to report on many topics 
previously banned including major accidents crime and ecological 
and medical problems boldirev noted the media still are limited 
when censors consider a report to contain state secrets or to be 
prejudicial to soviet interests 
also quick to earn the censors denial are articles incompatible 
with public morality and protection of health and any that seem to 
preach undermining or liquidating the socialist system boldirev 
said 
censorship continues in other ways last week authorities seized 
typewriters papers and other working materials of an unofficial 
leningrad weekly called democratic opposition said nikolai 
khamarov an activist in moscow

municipal health officials are 
testing a vending machine that would provide drug users with clean 
syringes at any time in an effort to halt the spread of aids a 
spokesman said wednesday 
ernst buning spokesman for amsterdams municipal health 
department said the city budgeted 17500 for the vending machine 
project which would make clean syringes available at night for the 
first time 
buning said a syringe exchange program for drug users has been 
under way in amsterdam since 1984 but drug counseling offices that 
distribute the syringes are open only during the day nights 
remain a problem he said 
if technical problems with the current prototype are resolved 
buning said a test model would be placed at one amsterdam location 
and the city would consult with residents to ensure it was being 
used only by those who need it 
he admitted it was a realistic concern that neighborhood 
children might buy a syringe from the machine to play with but 
claimed it would not influence them to become drug abusers 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a virus that 
attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
many infections and cancers no cure has been found 
the virus is most often transmitted through sexual contact other 
means of transmission include by transfusion of tainted blood or 
blood products and sharing contaminated hypodermic needles or 
syringes by drug abusers aids can also be passed from mother to 
child at or before birth 
the 5foothigh machine issues a sterile hypodermic syringe if a 
used one is inserted into a specially designed slot buning said 
the machine can tell whether it is really a syringe that is being 
inserted he said 
drug users can also buy a syringe from the machine by inserting 
50 cents 
buning claimed that only 27 percent of the dutch capitals 7000 
drug addicts have been infected with the aids virus because of the 
syringe exchange program as opposed to 6070 percent in cities like 
new york paris or milan 
however he conceded that as many as 5500 amsterdam heroin 
abusers do not inject the drug but inhale it instead 
at least were trying to do something about aids but whether 
it really helps in the long run we dont know buning said 
police in amsterdam and the port city of rotterdam routinely 
confiscate used syringes from drug abusers they arrest and issue the 
addicts clean ones when they are released 
of the 605 dutch aids patients about half have died according 
to figures released oct 1 
the amsterdam program is mainly geared to removing used syringes 
from circulation it has not led to any increase in drug abuse 
according to buning

merck amp co announced wednesday it is donating 
a new drug for the treatment of river blindness in 11 african 
countries and will provide the drug as long as it takes to 
eradicate this disease 
art kaufman a merck company spokesman said an independent 
committee of experts has approved a treatment program using the 
drug called mectizan and treatment of at least 250000 people in 
west africa will start next year 
a program for mass treatment in the 11 countries was developed by 
the onchocerciasis control program an organization in west africa 
the committee of experts organized at the request of merck 
examined the plan and approved it this week kaufman said 
other countries may receive the drug later if treatment programs 
are approved by the committee of experts he said 
we plan to donate this drug as long as it is needed as long as 
it takes to eradicate this disease said kaufman 
kaufman said merck had spent millions to develop the drug but he 
could not provide a figure for how much the drug distribution will 
cost the company 
river blindness the informal name for onchocerciasis is endemic 
in 35 countries and affects an estimated 18 million people 
the disease is caused by a parasitic worm that is spread to 
victims through the bite of the blackfly the blackfly thrives along 
the banks of fastmoving rivers hence the disease is informally 
called river blindness 
typically the disease is spread when a fly bites a person 
infected with river blindness and picks up microfilariae the 
immature form of the parasitic worm the parasite matures to an 
infective larvae inside the fly and is introduced into a new human 
victim when the fly bites again 
inside the human victim the larvae matures to an adult worm 
sometimes growing to well over two feet in length and produces 
millions of microfilariae which restart the cycle when a black fly 
bites 
infected humans suffer from itching weight loss the growth of 
nodules and a variety of lesions that eventually can cause blindness 
world health organization officials estimate that about 340000 
have been blinded by the disease and that there are about 85 million 
people in 35 developing countries who are at risk the disease 
occurs in large parts of west africa the middle east and in central 
and south america 
the 11 countries that will receive the initial shipment of the 
merck drug are benin burkina faso ghana guinea guinea bissau 
ivory coast mali niger senegal sierra leone and togo all are in 
west africa 
protection from river blindness requires an annual treatment with 
the drug the drug works by killing the microfilariae and preventing 
the adult worm from secreting more thus preventing the major 
symptoms of the disease and its transmission to other humans

a un report on human rights in iran says 
a renewed wave of executions began about the time the 
fundamentalist islamic government accepted a ceasefire in its 
8yearold war with iraq 
an advance copy of the report to the general assembly was 
obtained wednesday by the associated press it calls for continued 
scrutiny of irans human rights practices citing executions of 
political dissidents and other reports of abuses 
the first secretary of irans un mission amir hossein 
zamaninia said the mission had seen the report and had no comment 
un special representative reynaldo galindo pohl said in his 
report a large number of prisoners members of opposition groups 
were executed during the months of july august and early september 
1988 
most were members of the peoples mujahedeen an outlawed 
opposition group but the report said about 20 belonged to such 
other opposition groups as the tudeh party a marxist organization 
and the peoples fedayeen 
it did not say how many people had been put to death but 
mentioned groups of executions cited in iranian and other media from 
july through september that included 1140 political executions and 
others for common crimes 
iran accepted the ceasefire july 18 and it took effect aug 20 
five days later it began unmediated peace talks with iraq 
the washington office of the peoples mujahedeen said there has 
been a dramatic rise in political arrests torture and executions 
in iran since september 
specifically in the last three months alone more than 10000 
persons have been arrested and thousands executed on the charge of 
opposition to ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis regime said a 
statement by spokesman aladdin touran distributed at un 
headquarters 
the un report notes that the executions followed a july 2528 
raid into iran by national liberation army the armed wing of the 
peoples mujahedeen 
it said persecution of bahai worshipers appears to have 
decreased although irans attitude toward members of the faith has 
not changed bahais are denied the right to practice their faith in 
iran and cannot obtain higher education or work for the government 
by july 1988 a number of bahais including some prominent 
members of the bahai community who had been arrested allegedly 
because of their faith were released from prison and some prison 
sentences were reduced the report said 
galindo pohl interviewed seven bahais and nine sympathizers of 
the peoples mujahedeen who formerly lived in iran in addition to 
obtaining written accounts and information from iranian media his 
report said 
the report noted irans contention that islamic law may not match 
every tenet of international law and its disagreement with the 
principle that adherence to international law is a must for every 
state

an outbreak of whooping cough among rural 
amish who refuse vaccinations against the disease has claimed one 
infant and may threaten the lives of several other children health 
officials said wednesday 
the death of a fourmonthold boy monday in the cattaraugus 
county town of conewango is the first us whooping cough fatality 
in three years federal health officials said 
six other amish children have been diagnosed with the disease 
according to dr james wild director of the conewango valley 
medical center 
the same community was hit by 216 cases of the disease in 1982 
and six cases were reported in 1985 officials said there were no 
deaths from the previous outbreaks 
conewango is about 45 miles south of buffalo and is home to about 
1200 amish members of a strict mennonite sect that shuns modern 
conveniences 
the amish are a very closed society and they resist modern 
ways most of them just dont believe in immunizations they dont 
think they are necessary said patricia kota a registered nurse 
and assistant administrator of tricounty hospital in gowanda 
whooping cough or pertussis is a respiratory disease that 
causes a chronic cough vomiting and a characteristic whoop when 
the victim gasps for air 
among adults and older children it can seem to be little more 
than a cold but it can be fatal for infants and small children 
according to officials at the federal centers for disease control in 
atlanta ga 
the countrys most recent whooping cough outbreak affected about 
100 children last year in an amish settlement in delaware said 
kenneth allman spokesman for the disease control agency 
most children are protected against whooping cough by the dpt 
series of immunizations but most amish children do not get 
immunized officials said 
immunization is required of all public school children in new 
york unless there are extenuating religious or health reasons 
once the disease gets a foothold in this type of community it 
can take off quickly said william fagel a spokesman for the 
state health department

democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
went national wednesday with two tv commercials from california that 
play on anxieties about foreign interests buying up america 
i want an america thats in charge of its own future not a 
country that is selling off its land and its assets piece by piece 
to foreign interests dukakis says in the opening to both 
30second ads 
in one spot he says i want an america that exports its 
products not its jobs in the other he vows that were going 
to have clean air and clean water and clean coasts and a clean 
government in washington dc 
the two commercials were taped last week at a spirited rally at 
the scottish rite temple in los angeles both end with the tag line 
mike dukakis on your side

before the nov 8 election among them an upbeat musical commercial 
and a texas spot featuring sen lloyd bentsen dukakis vice 
presidential running mate 
the texas ad taped at a rally in nederland shows bentsen 
accusing republicans of trying to scare you with some phony 
issues they dont want to talk about real issues because theyve 
turned their backs on texans 
an announcer says texas lost 250000 jobs 200 banks and 23000 
businesses with george bush in washington bentsen concludes by 
asking his fellow texans to go democratic in next tuesdays 
balloting 
lee atwater bushs campaign manager said two new bush ads would 
start friday atwater said the new spots are positive and feature 
the vice president explaining to viewers why hes running for 
president 
meanwhile rep bill richardson dnm head of the dukakis 
campaigns hispanic vote drive complained of republican scare 
tactics in the rio grande valley

the electoral process i dont see these ads being aired in 
english and directed to the republicans core constituencies

national committee said the ad apparently is being run by some 
county party down there its not anything thats authorized by the

cambodian resistance leader son sann urged 
the general assembly on wednesday to keep up pressure on vietnam and 
for the 10th consecutive year to vote for a vietnamese troop 
withdrawal from cambodia 
we are more than ever close to a settlement son sann said 
we need your support more than ever to maintain the necessary 
pressure to obtain the withdrawal of foreign troops from cambodia 
he asked for a fixed timetable for withdrawal 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 every year since then 
the 159nation general assembly has overwhelmingly condemned the 
occupation and called for hanoi to withdraw its troops now 
estimated at 130000 
among signs of movement in resolving the cambodian conflict is a 
dialogue now under way among cambodian factions and between china 
and the soviet union 
son sann is prime minister of the threeparty coalition 
governmentinexile of democratic kampuchea or cambodia which is 
recognized by the united nations 
the resistance coalitions forces fighting the vietnamese include 
son sanns faction the forces of prince norodom sihanouk and the 
communist khmer rouge the largest and strongest force armed by 
china 
communist vietnam ousted the khmer rouge regime and replaced it 
with a prohanoi government which the un refuses to accept 
one complaint expressed by vietnams ambassador to the un 
trinh xuan lang in rejecting this years resolution on troop 
withdrawal was that it does not emphasize the importance of 
excluding khmer rouge leader pol pot and his associates from any 
future government in cambodia 
about 1 million cambodians were killed by executions famine and 
civil unrest under the khmer rouge from 197578 until the vietnamese 
invaders routed the pol pot regime 
the vote last year was 117 to 21 the resolution was expected to 
gain at least one vote this year despite soviet and vietnamese 
lobbying in favor of a milder draft resolution which would not call 
for withdrawal 
son sann appealed to moscow wednesday saying the cessation of 
soviet aid to vietnam would contribute greatly to withdrawal of 
occupying forces from cambodia 
soviet ambassador alexander m belonogov struck a conciliatory 
note in his address emphasizing the importance of ongoing dialogue 
among cambodian factions and countries in southeast asia 
he said however that the withdrawal of vietnamese troops must 
be linked to excluding pol pot and his associates a sentiment that 
has been echoed by several nations 
but chinese ambassador li luye whose government is the main 
backer and arms supplier of the khmer rouge maintained a hard line 
insisting on the total and unconditional withdrawal of vietnamese 
troops as the first step in a comprehensive political settlement 
li signaled however that china tempers its political support of 
the khmer rouge with realism by emphasizing that no single faction 
should dominate in a provisional government and no faction should be 
excluded 
son sann said that after vietnamese troop withdrawal a new 
provisional government must be formed in phnom penh from the three 
rebel factions and cambodians in the vietnamesebacked government 
that would be dissolved no faction would dominate and no one would 
be eliminated he said 
an international commission would oversee that phase as well as 
holding free and fair elections to choose a new government of a 
neutral and nonaligned cambodia 
asked about his uneasy alliance with the khmer rouge son sann 
told reporters we are in a coalition with a precise goal to free 
our country from the vietnamese occupation 
the cambodia resolution this year calls for the nonreturn of 
the universally condemned policies and practices of the recent 
past 
son sann said that phrase refers to the vietnamese although it 
is widely taken to refer as well to the khmer rouge

the reagan administration on wednesday was 
enjoined temporarily from restricting grievance procedures that 
advocates contend protect the rights of 34 million americans living 
in public housing 
us district judge john h pratt issued a temporary restraining 
order that bars the department of housing and urban development from 
implementing new regulations that had been set to take effect on 
monday 
pratt who scheduled further proceedings on nov 22 said 
tenants organizations that sued hud had raised some valid 
complaints about the elimination of many longstanding grievance 
procedures for tenants to contest eviction or complain about 
substandard living conditions 
tenants would be stripped of their rights to grievance 
proceedings to contest evictions or to force local housing 
authorities to provide heat and make repairs said florence roisman 
a staff attorney for the national housing law project 
ms roisman argued that hud was flouting the intent of congress 
by effectively repealing longstanding regulations that had been 
pieced together by legislation and a series of court decisions 
according to the plaintiffs complaint only people whose 
signatures appear on public housing leases would have a right to a 
grievance hearing under the new regulation 
the new regulations also would eliminate preeviction hearings 
before local housing authorities such hearings would take place in 
state courts the regulations also would narrow the category of 
issues that can be raised in grievance proceedings 
assistant us attorney william j dempster said hud was trying 
to take long overdue action to deregulate what has been a 
ponderous and byzantine centralized regulatory process 
the current regulations have straitjacketed public housing 
authorities and rendered them virtually unable to deal with the 
problems they are facing dempster said 
the regulations would only be interim because congress passed 
legislation expected to be signed into law by president reagan 
that requires the department to continue to review them 
the judge expressed some sympathy for huds position saying 
the public housing program has not been a smashing success it has 
been inordinately expensive 
some of the regulations make a lot of sense to me said 
pratt noting he once chaired a public housing authority in suburban 
montgomery county md on the other hand i think shes ms 
roisman got some valid complaints the judge told dempster 
some of the regulations make a lot of sense to me pratt told 
dempster on the other hand i think shes ms roisman got some 
valid complaints 
ms roisman pointed to a congressional report that said 
congress is seriously concerned that the recent regulations would 
weaken principles of fairness and due process that have been 
painstakingly developed over 20 years as a result of legislative and 
judicial actions 
the report from a housesenate conference committee said it was 
particularly dismayed that hud had ignored instructions in 
legislation to redraft the regulations to conform with a 1985 court 
decision that ruling found that congress intended to require 
grievance proceedings when a public housing agency refuses to make 
repairs or provide decent conditions 
we think the regulation that we published does precisely what 
congress intended hud attorney steven baylis said 
baylis said in a telephone interview that hud intended to make it 
easier to evict tenants who commit crimes 
if somebody in the family mugs another tenant it makes good 
common sense there should be a way to evict the family 
ms roisman contended that current regulations give authorities 
enough power to evict criminals without denying tenants due process

the justice department on wednesday joined a group 
opposing the official english initiative on the florida ballot 
arguing that petitions for the measure violated federal voting 
rights law 
last week us district james w kehoe threw out a suit seeking 
to stop the initiative but a special panel of federal judges is to 
consider an appeal of his decision at a hearing thursday 
the justice departments legal brief supports the effort to stop 
amendment 11 which would make english the states official language 
we think its fantastic maybe the best news ive heard in the 
campaign said jon weber executive director of speak up now 
which filed suit against the initiative on behalf of four 
spanishspeaking residents 
it shows we were right on the law he said the justice 
department does not get involved in suits of this nature and lose 
opponents have argued that petitions for the initiative should 
have been circulated in spanish as well as english in six heavily 
hispanic florida counties 
florida english the group that collected more than 500000 
signatures to put the initiative on tuesdays ballot successfully 
argued before kehoe that the petitions were private not public and 
therefore not covered under the federal voting rights act a federal 
appeals court had made a similar ruling in a colorado case 
the justice department is opposing those rulings in what weber 
says is the first time the federal government has entered the 
official english controversy 
they reject the argument that the petition process is 
private weber said they say the state is clearly involved 
throughout the petition process and that the election itself is 
merely the culmination of that process 
florida english chairman mark laporta reacted angrily to news of 
the justice departments intervention 
im offended that theyre involved laporta said what 
theyre doing is a last ditch effort based on a glitch a 
technicality 
he said it would not change the groups efforts which the latest 
polls show is likely to receive the support of 70 percent of 
floridas voters

disease during the last years of his life a leading newspaper 
reported wednesday

psychiatric clinic in cologne had examined hitlers medical records 
and had studied newsreels of the nazi leader from the years

life it is often characterized by tremors muscular rigidity or 
loss of balance 
adolf hitler suffered in his last years from a definite

impairment of hitlers arm movements a shortening of his strides 
changes in his facial appearance and a trembling of his left hand

the justice department announced wednesday that 
it will stay out of a private suit by four northrop corp employees 
alleging the company defrauded the government in the production of 
the b2 stealth bomber 
assistant attorney general john bolton head of the justice 
departments civil division said in a statement that after a review 
and investigation of the allegations the department has decided 
that there is not a sufficient basis for it to enter the case at 
this time 
the lawsuit says northrops advance systems division falsely 
represented to the government that its cost schedule control system 
met contractual requirements and that northrop submitted falsified 
reports on cost performance and other matters 
the suit which was filed last february in us district court in 
los angeles by a current northrop employee terrence schielke and 
three former northrop workers also alleges labor mischarging and 
mischarging on sales orders and said the company charged the 
government for idle time of its employees 
northrop has denied the accusations 
the baltimore sun in a story last week quoted congressional 
sources as saying the justice department wont take over the lawsuit 
because some air force personnel overlooked irregularities to keep 
development of the classified project moving ahead 
a justice department spokeswoman amy brown declined to provide 
any details on why the government isnt joining the private suit 
the justice department could enter the private suit later on a 
showing of good cause 
meanwhile the us attorneys office in los angeles is 
conducting a criminal investigation of northrops work on the 
bomber which is due to be unveiled on nov 22 
the b2 is to be operational in the early 1990s and congress has 
authorized the purchase of 132 of the bombers which are built with 
materials designed to make the aircraft less visible to enemy radar 
the total estimated cost for the planes is 366 billion

australian gynecologist william mcbride 
who alerted the world to the dangers of the drug thalidomide on 
human fetuses in the 1960s was found guilty of scientific fraud 
wednesday 
an independent inquiry headed by former high court chief justice 
sir harry gibbs found that mcbride deliberately falsified the 
results of a 1980 experiment on rabbits involving birth defects 
mcbride 61 immediately resigned as head of research at the 
sydneybased foundation 41 which he started in 1971 to research 
birth defects the institution was financed by the proceeds of 
international awards for his work on thalidomide 
about 8000 babies were born around the world with severe 
deformities attributed to thalidomide a sedative administered to 
pregnant women until mcbrides findings led to its banning 
mcbride issued a statement through lawyers protesting his 
innocence saying i reject absolutely the finding that scientific 
fraud occurred in connection with the experiment 
it said he resigned because i dont wish that there be any 
doubt cast over the work that i and the foundation have done over 
the past 16 years 
the foundations board called the inquiry after pressure from the 
scientific community about fraud allegations by two former research 
assistants broadcast on an australian broadcasting corp radio 
program last december 
researchers phil vardy and jill french said that mcbride reported 
in a 1982 edition of the australian journal of biological sciences 
that two of eight rabbits given the drug scopolamine hydrobromide 
produced deformed fetuses 
vardy and french claimed that in fact only one of six rabbits 
produced deformed offspring that a dosage table was altered and 
that the article falsely reported that fetuses were sectioned and 
control rabbits were kept 
gibbs and two medical researchers began hearing evidence in 
secret in july 
in a 25page report released late wednesday they supported the 
allegations and found that mcbride deliberately falsified the 
contents of the article 
the experiment mentioned in that paper was not conducted in 
accordance with proper scientific method and was not honestly 
reported they found 
the above experiment and its published results does suggest 
that in relation to the publication of those results dr mcbride was 
lacking in scientific integrity 
the report said mcbride claimed in evidence that a drug company 
was out to destroy his credibility as a witness in legal action by 
users of a morning sickness drug but it said no evidence of bias 
was found among the witnesses against him 
foundation 41s board said in a statement it accepted mcbrides 
resignation as honorary medical director of the foundation with 
regret and appreciated his offer to continue to serve while a 
replacement was found

prime minister margaret thatcher of britain 
told the polish premier wednesday she sees similarities between 
changes she has made in britain and the difficult choices facing 
poland a british official said 
he said mrs thatcher who turned britain away from socialism 
told premier mieczyslaw f rakowski of this troubled communist 
nation the problem is that the difficulties always come first 
before the successes 
rakowski has pledged to revitalize polands economy and 
restructure its industry 
both rakowskis government and the opposition led by the 
outlawed solidarity free trade union hope to use mrs thatchers 
threeday visit to advance their arguments on the proper pace and 
direction of political and economic reform in poland 
it appeared however that mrs thatcher would tread a wary line 
the british official speaking on condition of anonymity said mrs 
thatcher told the premier she had no desire to interfere in internal 
polish affairs 
she arrived in a royal air force jet and received a lowkey 
welcome from rakowski at warsaws military airport 
hail soldiers mrs thatcher said in polish to a military 
honor guard turned out to greet her 
hail citizen premier the honor guard replied in unison 
also in polish 
neither mrs thatcher nor rakowski the communist party 
propaganda chief who became premier sept 27 made public remarks at 
the airport they left immediately for a government guest house 
state media have been calling attention to parallels between 
rakowskis goals and the success of thatcherism in britain 
including her tackling of trade unions and paring back of outdated 
statesubsidized industry 
according to the british official rakowski said he was 
determined to revive the economy although it was hard to have a 
marxist closing down lenin his reference was to mondays 
government order to shut the lenin shipyard in gdansk birthplace of 
the outlawed union solidarity for economic reasons dec 1 
solidarity founder lech walesa says the move is political aimed 
at punishing the yard for its support of solidarity and depriving 
the union of one of its most important bases 
walesa plans to greet mrs thatcher on friday when she becomes 
the first western head of government to travel to gdansk to meet 
him walesa made clear wednesday his admiration of the conservative 
party leaders hardline approach to communism but was less 
enthusiastic about her domestic policies 
i lech walesa and the whole of polish society respect mrs 
margaret thatcher even love her he told reporters in gdansk 
but the mrs thatcher of foreign policy not for the domestic 
affairs of britain 
on wednesday evening mrs thatcher began her private schedule 
with a onehour call at the residence of cardinal jozef glemp the 
roman catholic primate followed by a meeting with six prominent 
intellectuals that lasted more than an hour 
the british official said she was warmly received by glemp 
spiritual leader of the vast majority of polands 38 million people 
who consider themselves catholic 
she told glemp she wished to encourage those wanting to move 
down the road to freedom the official said but noted again she 
did not mean to interfere in polish affairs 
aleksander paszynski one of intellectuals and a proponent of 
private enterprise said they stressed the unbreakable link 
between economic and political reforms and the governments need 
of gaining social support for any reform plan 
it was a wonderful discussion marvelous mrs thatcher told 
reporters afterward 
her schedule thursday includes meetings with gen wojciech 
jaruzelski the polish leader and a banquet at which she is 
expected to make the major speech of her visit 
she also is to visit the grave of a prosolidarity priest the 
rev jerzy popieluszko slain in 1984 by security officers who were 
later tried and imprisoned 
on friday mrs thatcher flies with jaruzelski to gdansk where 
together they visit the westerplatte penisula where german naval 
forces opened fire on sept 1 1939 in the opening shots of world 
war ii 
jaruzelski then returns to warsaw while mrs thatcher meets with 
walesa and other solidarity leaders and visits the monument to slain 
shipyard workers erected just outside the lenin shipyard 
another meeting with jaruzelski and a news conference closes out 
the first visit by a british prime minister to poland 
polish officials have been very eager for the visit and warsaw 
was festooned with polish flags flying alongside the union jack in 
greeting most newspapers carried her photo and a brief biography on 
front pages 
officials want to convince mrs thatcher of their seriousness in 
reforming the economy hoping that she will use her influence to 
open up western credits that were virtually closed off when martial 
law was imposed in december in 1981 
in addition to outdated industries poland has the east blocs 
largest foreign debt approaching 40 billion and would like new 
financing to ease the debt burden

an investigating committee decided wednesday to call 
the finance ministers former top aide and two other witnesses to 
testify about an insidertrading stock scandal involving senior 
politicians 
the special parliamentary committee said it would call tsuneo 
hattori former secretary to finance minister kiichi miyazawa and 
business associates yasufumi kawai and shigeo sugawara 
they will be asked about their roles in buying stock of the real 
estate firm recruitcosmos co in miyazawas name before it was 
put on public sale no date for their appearance was set 
opposition parties accuse hiromasa ezoe founder of the parent 
recruit inc of making advance shares of recruitcosmos available 
to politicians business leaders and journalists in return for 
privileges or favors 
when recruitcosmos was listed on the overthecounter market in 
october 1986 the stocks value soared and those who had bought it 
in advance made huge profits 
a 13th politician became associated with the scandal wednesday 
when katsuya ikeda admitted that his brother bought advance shares 
of recruitcosmos ikeda deputy secretarygeneral of the opposition 
komeito clean government party said in a televised news 
conference he had no knowledge of the purchase 
finance minister miyazawa told the investigating committee last 
week the sale of 10000 recruitcosmos shares in 1986 yielded a 
profit of 227 million yen then about 140000 but said he did 
not know the transaction was made in his name 
he said kawai a business acquaintance of his former secretary 
hattori asked the aide to let miyazawas name be used in the 
purchase of recruitcosmos shares from sugawara chairman of do best 
inc 
japanese media have said do best a cosmetics importer was the 
middleman in the advance sale the newspaper asahi reported 
wednesday that sugawara and ezoe of recruit inc were university 
classmates in the early 1960s and ezoe helped sugawara set up his 
company in 1974 
the government has said the transactions were not illegal but 
the case raises ethical questions about the intimate links between 
business and politics in japan parliament tightened insidertrading 
laws after the scandal broke last summer

us gen john r galvin nato 
commander in europe said wednesday that an atmosphere of 
delusion that the soviets are no longer a military threat could 
seriously weaken western security 
intentions can change overnight galvin cautioned i do not 
want to find military capablilites lowered in the west and then see 
for one reason or another a change in the atmosphere in the east 
galvin the supreme allied commander in europe was guest speaker 
of the bonnbased konrad adenauer foundation think tank 
he said that in the west there is a wishful thinking and 
willingness to believe that some grand change has already taken 
place in terms of the danger to the west from the size of the 
military in the east 
this willingness is causing the west to get deeper into a 
situation in which support for deterrence and defense may be 
seriously weakened 
there is an atmosphere of delusion and a willingness to accept 
that delusion 
galvin said political changes in the soviet union and their 
effects on other east bloc nations should not be allowed to result 
in weakened western defenses 
the soviet union is certainly undergoing enormous internal 
changes and these have their effects externally he said 
as we look at what those effects will be there is a great 
element of unpredictability and possibly instability in this 
transition which appears to be beginning to take place in the east 
the commander also said the soviet military continues to pose a 
serious threat to the west 
the soviet union has indicated it is really no longer as 
offensive as it was before and is in fact defensive and is much 
less a threat that is rhetoric he said 
the soviet union today is producing about the same amount of 
military armaments as it was producing when soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev took office in 1985 
he said that according to the latest nato estimates the warsaw 
pact has 30900 tanks while the north atlantic treaty organization 
has about 20000 
galvin reiterated his support for modernizing nato shortrange 
nuclear weapons based in western europe as a means of offsetting 
superior warsaw pact conventional forces 
he said he opposes easing western restrictions on exporting 
hightechnology goods to the east bloc

sen dan quayle an ardent opponent of 
abortion said wednesday he has no quarrel with a medical procedure 
that he said is aimed at preventing conception after rape 
the republican vice presidential nominee said he would not 
construe that as being an abortion 
quayle refused to acknowledge that the postrape medical 
procedure known as dilation and curettage or dandc would amount 
to abortion in the event that conception had occurred 
well my position is that i understand from a medical situation 
that immediately after rape that is reported that a woman 
normally in fact can go to the hospital and have a dandc at that 
time that is before the actual forming of a life he said when 
faced with the theoretical question of whether rape victims should 
be allowed to have abortions 
quayle has repeatedly said in the past that he would accept 
abortion only if it were necessary to save the life of the mother 
and he reiterated that position during a news conference here 
but when asked pointedly whether he would expect a rape victim to 
have the rapists baby he said hopefully they would seek medical 
attention immediately and under normal medical procedure life and 
conception would not even begin 
quayle said that while his personal preference is that there 
should be no abortion except to save a mothers life a woman may 
legally have the pregnancy terminated 
leonard dinger a spokesman for the national righttolife 
committee in washington said our position is that there are 
certain medical procedures that can prevent conception within 24 
hours of that rape taking place 
if conception had already taken place we would oppose it he 
said 
dr robert shesser a specialist in emergency care medicine at 
george washington university medical center in washington said in a 
telephone interview that dandc is not the medical treatment most 
immediately used for rape victims 
once it has been determined that conception has taken place he 
said in an interview the victim is offered a socalled morning 
after pill aimed at changing her body chemistry in a way to make 
the uterus unreceptive to the growth of a fertilized egg 
dandc is not an immediate postrape procedure shesser 
said adding that emergency room physicians seldom resort to that 
procedure which is a scraping of the uterine lining 
quayle said tuesday he favors having the supreme court overturn 
the landmark roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion and said it 
should be revert to a states rights issue 
on wednesday he was asked theoretically whether a woman 
impregnated through rape should be expected to bring the fetus to 
full term 
no i understand that the medical procedure a normal dandc 
right after rape that you would not even get into a conception and 
life would not even be formed he said thats my understanding 
from a medical point of view and therefore you wouldnt even get 
into life being 
when asked how he would view a dandc if conception had taken 
place quayle said doing it under this particular type of 
situation its a normal medical procedure and i do not construe 
that as being an abortion 
pressed to explain his position further he said i think that 
reporting of the rape going into the hospital and right after 
that having a dandc i think is a perfectly normal response and 
one that i would not put in the category of abortion 
as he headed toward his plane on leaving memphis quayle was 
asked again about his statements and told inquiring reporters i 
think it really is nitpicking to question his abortion stand 
because of the votes that we have had against abortion 
youre getting all sorts of very difficult medical 
terminologies he said and you know what my position on 
abortion is 
youre getting into all sorts of difficult sensitive areas that 
i dont have all the answers to the senator said 
quayle also said that i dont perceive that having the e and 
c procedure right after a rape as being tantamount to abortion 
quayle began his campaign day by fielding questions from local 
reporters at which time the abortion issue surfaced and making 
appearances at a high school rally and senior citizens center he 
was traveling to owensboro ky later in the day 
questions about abortion have hounded quayle in recent days 
particularly following his suggestion to a 12yearold girl that she 
should go ahead and give birth in a theoretical situation in which 
she was raped by her father and became pregnant 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis campaigning in 
california earlier this week jumped on quayles statement given 
during an interview with a childrens express reporter 
dukakis said such statements proved that the republican party has 
been on the wrong side of every issue of importance to women

a charity group has bought 19 shotgun shacks 
for 1 or 2 each and plans to turn the shanties into emergency 
shelters for the rural poor 
madison countians allied against poverty won on bids submitted 
tuesday to the board of alderman on 19 of 20 homes the buildings 
made up a shantytown on the edge of canton which is 20 miles north 
of jackson 
sister mary mcguire executive director of the group said the 
renovated houses will be used to help people like one madison county 
family currently living in a house where you almost fall through 
the floor when you walk in 
were interested in helping a couple of burnedout families and 
were interested in using them for several families out in the 
country that live in housing that is in a dilapidated condition 
she said 
she also said the shacks could be used as a room added on to an 
existing house 
the shanties were built in the 1930s to house lumberyard workers 
the one and tworoom tin roof buildings lack electricity and 
indoor plumbing 
city officials bought the property in september and wanted to 
tear down the dilapidated structures and offer the site for 
development 
but the state department of archives and history saying the 
structures had historical architectural significance asked city 
officials to take bids on the houses instead 
madcaap won the first 19 bids but moses wright of canton bid 
500 on the 20th shack and assumed ownership of the building he did 
not indicate how he intended to use it 
the charity group is making plans to move the rundown shacks and 
estimates it will cost about 800 to 1000 each sister mcguire 
said volunteers will help with the renovations 
the organizations bids were welcomed by mayor sidney runnels 
who had expressed hope the group would get some of the houses 
i think its a good cause runnels said were very 
supportive of what they are doing 
the homes cant be used as residences within the city because 
they dont meet the city code 
only three families still live in the shantytown and they are 
expected to be relocated by the end of this month the city using 
money from a block grant has been relocating residents of the 
shantytown since august

leaders of the rightwing likud bloc expressed 
confidence they could form a government and began coalition talks 
wednesday with four ultraorthodox religious parties that will 
decide who will govern the nation 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud and its allies won 46 of 
the 120 seats in tuesdays election labor and sympathetic leftwing 
parties won 49 so either major party could form a government with 
support from the religious factions which won a total of 18 seats 
two parties on the extreme left won the other seven seats 
although likud generally is more sympathetic to the orthodox 
view one of the main religious parties said a coalition remained 
possible with labor by foreign minister shimon peres 
demands by the religious parties include strict rules on 
observing the sabbath and changes in the policy that extends 
automatic citizenship to all jews including converts 
the toll rose in the 11monthold rebellion in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip which was a major issue in the election 
soldiers shot a palestinian to death in the west bank town of 
qalqiliya bringing to at least 306 the number killed since the 
uprising began dec 8 1987 ten israelis also have been slain 
likud won 39 seats on its own in the knesset as israel calls its 
parliament and labor got 38 according to the nearly final count of 
tuesdays vote 
shamir said early wednesday the outcome commanded likud to 
form a government and expressed willingness to negotiate on any 
demands of the regigious parties likud and labor have been in a 
fragile coalition since the indecisive election of july 1984 
yossi ahimeir spokesman for shamir said religious leaders told 
the prime minister likud has natural sympathy to religious demands 
and all would prefer a coalition with likud over labor 
after meeting with peres however spokesman moshe peretz of the 
torah guardians party said we feel that all options are open we 
dont rule out talks with any party the conditions are that they 
come to terms with our requirements 
his party known by its hebrew initials shas won 6 knesset seats 
most religious legislators are closer to shamirs viewpoint on 
the palestinian issue he vows to keep all the occupied territories 
which some orthodox consider part of biblical israel but peres has 
expressed willingness to exchange some territory for peace 
other demands by the orthodox whose political clout is greater 
than their numbers make both major parties uneasy 
most controversial is a change in the law under which converts 
would be considered jewish in israel and eligible for automatic 
citizenship only if they were converted by orthodox rabbis 
without a real promise on this whoisajew question we will 
not go into any coalition said avraham verdiger of the agudat 
israel faction which won five seats 
such an amendment could alienate american jews most of whom 
belong to the conservative and reform movements of judaism labor 
has opposed such changes in the law 
other demands mentioned by leaders of the religious parties 
include prohibiting soccer games and closing theaters and 
restaurants on the sabbath and increasing military exemptions for 
seminary students 
yitzhak peretz leader of the torah guardian party said likud 
appeared more likely to meet at least some religious demands then 
added i wouldnt say only the likud can do it but that likud 
appears the more reasonable prospects 
spokesmen for both likud and labor said they would have no 
comment on the demands because negotiations were in the early stages 
observers attributed some of the success of the ultraorthodox 
parties to the highly organized efforts of the habad hassidim its 
head rabbi menachem mendel schneerson of the brooklyn nybased 
lubavitcher group offered personal blessings as a reward to 
volunteers who canvassed towns 
the daily haaretz said more than 1000 ultraorthodox voters flew 
in from europe and the united states to cast their ballots israeli 
law prevents absentee voting 
the high political price set by religious parties has forced 
likud to consider inviting labor into another coalition this time 
as junior partner rather than an equal 
ahimeir quoted shamir as saying he would consider it and labor 
party officials reported behindthescenes contacts with the likud 
by law israels president decides which party will be asked to 
form a government 
president chaim herzog told shamir on wednesday he will not begin 
consultations until the official election results are published late 
next week 
israeli officials estimated coalition bargaining could take two 
months with the current coalition serving as caretaker

a judge declared a mistrial wednesday in a probate 
court dispute in which the former head of the american psychiatric 
association is accused of exploiting a wealthy patient 
cook county judge frank petrone ordered the jury excused in the 
midst of the opening statements by an attorney for dr george 
pollock an executor of the estate of anne p lederer who died in 
1984 at age 78 
the legal battle is between pollock one of chicagos leading 
psychoanalysts and francis l lederer ii the only child of mrs 
lederer 
mrs lederer left most of her estimated 5 million estate to a 
nonprofit institute she established four years earlier to promote 
psychiatric research and music none of the money has been paid 
however while her son has contested the case in court 
mrs lederers will leaves 200000 to her son and several 
thousand dollars to two grandchildren 
in 1976 mrs lederer set up a fund that has paid pollock 50000 
a year and will continue paying him through 1993 she established a 
second trust that has paid pollocks family 30000 a year since 
1978 court records are not clear when the second trust expires 
in his opening statement wednesday pollocks attorney robert 
tepper said mrs lederer had previously set up a 2 million 
irrevocable trust for her son the trust was not part of the will 
she later decided it was a mistake to make the trust 
irrevocable and told people the only thing her son wanted from her 
was her money tepper told the jury 
lederers attorney philip doran objected to the comment and 
after confering with the lawyers petrone told the panel that he was 
declaring a mistrial because the remark was prejudicial he 
discharged the jury 
pollock who was present in the courtroom and tepper made no 
comment 
lederer says pollock improperly used his influence over mrs 
lederer to urge her to establish the institute which promotes 
psychiatric research and music 
pollock conducted up to five sessions a week with mrs lederer 
from 1969 to 1980 when he transferred her case to two other 
psychiatrists saying he needed more time for other professional 
duties court documents show 
pollock continued prescribing medication for her until 1983 and 
records show he told the succeeding psychiatrists in a letter 
incidentally i do hope that you are charging her a full fee for 
your housecalls and visits she can well afford it 
in an affidavit dec 4 1986 pollock denied the allegations 
against him 
in his opening statement richard phelan the lawyer for the 
research institute said establishing the organization is clearly 
what she mrs lederer wanted to do 
she wanted to create a foundation and a trust that would bear 
her name so that people would remember her as a woman who gave her 
monies to charity he said 
tepper was the third and last lawyer making an opening statement 
to the jury which took four days to be selected 
no date for selecting a new jury in the probate dispute was set 
lawyers were scheduled to meet with petrone on thursday

spanish embassy officials say a formal notice 
of release was delivered wednesday to the spanish prison where a 
photographer from virginia is scheduled to be released to the us 
government 
conan owen 24 of annandale va has been imprisoned since 
march 1987 on cocaine trafficking charges us officials say owen 
was set up by drug smugglers and spanish officials announced friday 
that owen would be transferred to the united states to complete his 
sixyear sentence 
a formal notice of agreement of the spanish government was 
given a few hours ago to the jail in barcelona by the spanish 
ministry of justice spanish embassy spokeswoman helga soto said 
wednesday evening 
she said she did not know the exact date of owens release 
i think it is a fast process but i dont know when it will 
take place soto said 
us officials have the authority to parole owen as soon as he 
arrives 
you pray that it was yesterday hope it will be tomorrow and 
expect the end of the month said ernest owen conans father 
after learning of the transfer of papers 
this is probably the first of a number of administrative 
steps ernest owen said the hurdle was the agreement by the 
spanish government to release him and thats been cleared 
he said he had not been notified by the embassy of any official 
action 
the owen family has waged an unflagging campaign to convince us 
authorities that their son had been duped into acting as a drug 
courier 
their efforts eventually led to a us prosecutor in alexandria 
va a drug enforcement administration agent in madrid dea 
administrator john c lawn and ultimately thenattorney general 
edwin meese iii to conclude that owen was innocent of the 
trafficking charges 
an alexandria va resident george barahona admitted in 
february that he and others without owens knowledge hid four 
pounds of cocaine in a false bottom of a suitcase that they then 
asked owen to take to barcelona 
owen had been hired to do freelance photography work for barahona 
in spain 
at the time a justice department spokesman said meese was 
confident that the court papers including a polygraph test passed 
by owen would convince spanish authorities to drop the charges 
in april 1987 however a court in barcelona found owen guilty of 
drug trafficking sentencing him to six years and a day in prison 
and imposing an 18000 fine in a written opinion the judges said 
they rejected barahonas confession because it was obtained as part 
of a plea bargain which is illegal in spain 
owen became eligible to return to the united states under an 
international treaty governing exchanges of sentenced prisoners to 
become eligible for return under the treaty owen had to drop his 
appeal of his conviction in spanish courts

four religious parties potential kingmakers 
after israels inconclusive elections are demanding a high price 
for their support no soccer or movies on the sabbath and control 
over conversions to judaism 
orthodox and ultraorthodox parties scored a stunning surprise by 
amassing 18 seats tuesday in the 120member parliament an increase 
of four seats from 1984 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc and foreign 
minister shimon peres leftleaning labor party finished in virtual 
deadlock they want to end their joint rule but neither can form a 
government without at least some religious support 
religious parties sought cabinet posts such as the ministries of 
religion education and housing they also demanded public 
entertainment be outlawed on the biblically mandated day of rest 
avraham shapira of the agudat israel party which won five seats 
said that on the sabbath theaters should be shut and soccer games 
rescheduled 
i am sure the lord willing that on the sabbath movie houses 
will be closed he said nonreligious jews have televisions at 
home they can watch tv 
secular leaders warned the rise of jewish fundamentalism could 
foreshadow a new era of bans on freedom of action similar to those 
imposed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis islamic revolution in iran 
if we all get religious who will sit in the ships and the 
tanks when the rightwing messianic composition that we witness 
brings war upon us shulamit aloni leader of the liberal 
antireligious citizens rights movement said on israel radio 
religious party leaders have said their major goal is stopping 
what they see as a moral decline but refraining from coercion 
i want to tell the general public that we have no intentions to 
impose said avner shaki leader of the national religious party 
which won five seats 
we only want to give the jewish public a clearly jewish 
character which is required by the fact that israel is a jewish 
state he said 
heading the orthodox agenda is a demand to revise israels law of 
return which grants automatic citizenship to all jews religious 
parties want the state to recognize as jewish only those born to a 
jewish mother or converted by an orthodox rabbi 
changing the law would alienate american jews interfaith 
marriages are on the rise in the united states where the majority of 
the 5 million jews belong to reform or conservative movements 
religious parties seek to toughen laws against abortion 
christian missionary activites the performing of autopsies and 
archaeological digs near cemeteries 
chaim bergman news editor of agudat israels daily newspaper 
hamoudia said ultraorthodox jews were divided on the lengths to 
which israel could go in trading territory for peace with the arabs 
as proposed by labor 
we are more or less with the line of likud on the need for 
autonomy for palestinans said bergman you can say we are 
opposed to giving back territory but not at any price 
only the national religious party has given a high priority to 
the issue arguing that israel must keep the west bank and gaza 
strip seized in the 1967 war 
labor is most ardently courting shas which won six seats and is 
committed to preserving the traditions of sephardic jews from 
islamic countries allied with shas is the torah flag party which 
won two seats and is a breakway from agudat israel 
shas spokesman moshe peretz said we have a stronger affinity to 
the right although we dont reject categorically that we will find 
a way with labor 
shmuel sandler a social scientist from the religious bar ilan 
university near tel aviv said religious groups which had remained 
aloof from politics in the past launched a wellorganized campaign 
it came as a complete surprise nobody expected it he said 
adding the religious parties apparently foresaw israel was deeply 
split and they could control the balance of power 
one reason for the surprise was that public opinion pollsters do 
not venture into tightly knit ultraorthodox communities where 
residents often refuse to cooperate preelection polls indicated 
the religious would only get 10 to 12 seats 
observers attributed some of ultraorthodox success to the entry 
of the highly organized habad hassidim headed by the brooklyn 
nybased lubavitcher rabbi menachem mendel schneerson 
bergman noted the popular rabbi offered personal blessings as an 
inducement to volunteers who canvassed towns in vans handing out 
literature and putting up posters 
the daily haaretz said more than 1000 ultraorthodox voters flew 
in election day from europe and the united states to cast their 
ballots israeli law prevents absentee voting

were awarded a 7 million contract to a build a weather radar system 
for the air force 
the 27count indictment names enterprise electronics corp the 
companys president c neil braswell 54 and a former employee 
michael trawick 32 both of new brockton 
us attorney james wilson said the company and the two men are 
charged with trying to defraud the government making false 
statements and filing false claims in connection with a 7 million 
contract the company received to build a weather radar system for 20 
military bases 
according to the indictment the defendants inflated the cost of 
towers protective devices known as radomes and color monitor 
displays also the charges allege the two men understated the 
profit the company expected to make on the contract both during 
contract negotiations and during an audit 
none of defendants was immediately available for comment a woman 
who answered the telephone at enterprise electronics said braswell 
had left for the day and there would be no comment on the charges 
before thursday

statements could be sentenced to 135 years in prison and fined 
2175 million 
wilson said it was the second major indictment in alabama against 
a defense contractor within three weeks reflecting a reemphasis on 
such cases by attorney general richard thornburgh 
in the earlier case sperry corp and unisys corp were accused 
of falsely billing the government for more than 5 million in 
charges and retired air force col robert l hedges 51 of 
montgomery was accused of negotiating a consulting job with sperry

after refusing to speak to reporters since his 
criminal indictment nearly two weeks ago deposed philippine 
president ferdinand marcos lashed out at the news media wednesday 
the media has declared president ferdinand marcos guilty of 
several charges filed against him marcos said in a statement 
issued through aide arturo aruiza whatever happened to the 
timehonored legal maxim that anyone is presumed innocent unless 
proven otherwise 
marcos and his wife imelda were indicted oct 21 in new york on 
criminal racketeering charges accusing them of plundering their 
homeland of more than 100 million and using it to buy artwork and 
manhattan real estate 
mrs marcos 59 pleaded innocent monday to the charges but 
marcos 71 remained in honolulu defense lawyers claimed marcos was 
too frail to make the trip 
an aide said marcos was upset by the medias treatment of mrs 
marcos 
in protesting his innocence marcos presented the results of old 
investigations which he said cleared him of allegations of 
wrongdoing 
we reiterate that these matters are of record and have been the 
subject of numerous discussions years ago and have been included in 
various pleadings in the united states and in the philippines he 
said 
we honestly believe that this should be given special 
consideration by political observers analysts and investigative 
reporters who now specialize in depriving president marcos of his 
right to be presumed innocent unless proven otherwise marcos said 
where is the sense of justice and fairness when the present 
media have already convicted president marcos of these charges in 
utter and flagrant disregard of previous findings proving the 
contrary he said 
marcos said the us general accounting office in 1986 cleared 
him of allegations that he plundered his country or that he 
illegally used us military or humanitarian aid for his own 
benefit before he was ousted the philippine parliment cleared him 
of the same charges he said 
his successor corazon aquino said the parliments investigation 
was a whitewash controlled by marcos 
marcos said the federal elections commission twice ruled there 
was no evidence he illegally contributed money to american political 
candidates allegations a us congressional subcommittee is 
reportedly investigating

a judge on wednesday ordered individual 
trials for 14 black legislators charged with trespassing during an 
attempt to remove the confederate battle flag from the state capitol 
montgomery county district judge craig miller made the decision 
in response to a request by the prosecution 
prosecutors presented 2 hours of testimony against the first 
defendant state rep thomas reed and miller rejected a defense 
request to throw out the case 
then he indefinitely recessed the nonjury case citing his 
crowded docket and scheduling conflicts affecting witnesses and the 
prominent civil rights lawyers who have traveled to montgomery 
without pay to represent reed 
ernestine sapp of tuskegee a defense attorney predicted reeds 
trial might resume after the first of the year she said the 
indefinite delay gives time to settle the case by dismissing the 
charges 
assistant district attorney david glanzer said he remained ready 
to proceed at any time 
the legislators were charged with criminal trespassing for 
grabbing a fence around the capitol which is closed for renovation 
on feb 2 during a demonstration decrying the confederate flag as a 
symbol of racism the charge carries a penalty of up to three months 
in jail and a 500 fine 
during opening arguments glanzer said police repeatedly warned 
the legislators they would be arrested if they touched the fence 
and that putting ones fingers through a fence constitutes 
trespassing under alabama law 
the defense argued that no crime occurred because the legislators 
never entered the capitol grounds 
now we go to the ridiculous whether someones fingers went 
through the fence thats ridiculous even for alabama defense 
attorney jl chestnut of selma said 
reed 60 the senior black in the alabama legislature went on 
trial first because tom was nominally in charge of the protest 
and was arrested first chestnut said 
reed was convicted sept 30 on federal extortion charges and a 
court has ordered his removal from office upon his sentencing he 
claims the extortion case was built against him because of his 
threat to physically pull down the confederate flag from atop the 
capitol if the republican governor failed to do it before the 
opening day of the 1988 legislative session 
gov guy hunt says he views the flag as a historic emblem and 
refuses to remove it unless the legislature votes to do so a 
resolution to remove the flag failed to win passage in the house on 
feb 2 
state capitol police chief cecil humphrey testified that two or 
three days before the demonstration hunts legal adviser mark 
montiel made the decision to charge reed and other black 
legislators with trespassing if they tried to enter the fenced 
capitol grounds

a woman accused of helping to lure a 
businessman from his home and burying him alive in a botched ransom 
attempt was found guilty wednesday on murder and kidnapping charges 
nancy rish 26 was convicted in the death of businessman stephen 
small after a winnebago county jury deliberated for an hour and 40 
minutes 
this jurys verdict was swift and just said prosecutor 
michael ficaro small 40 member of a prominent media family and 
greatgrandson of the late illinois gov len small was lured from 
his home by kidnapers who placed him in a homemade box and buried it 
in sandy soil on sept 2 1987 
telephone calls were made to smalls wife nancy seeking a 
ransom but she was unable to decipher instructions for a dropoff 
and no ransom was ever offered small suffocated when a makeshift 
air supply system failed 
ms rishs livein boyfriend daniel edwards was convicted of 
smalls murder and kidnapping in may and sentenced to death 
prosecutors said they would not seek the death penalty for ms rish 
kankakee county circuit judge john michela set her sentencing for 
dec 6 
the jury which was sequestered was selected in rockford because 
of extensive publicity in the kankakee area 
ficaro had argued that ms rish and edwards believed the 
abduction would lead to a 1 million ransom and that ticket to 
easy street life in the fast lane 
he called ms rish a gold digger who lured small from his 
home so edwards could bury him alive as part of a plot to collect 
the ransom 
ms rishs attorneys maintained that she was the victim of 
mistaken identity and that edwards had been with another blond 
person when the crimes were committed 
ms rish took the stand on her own behalf near the end of the 
trial acknowledging she took edwards to various sites significant 
to the crimes but saying she did not know what edwards was doing

a person answering the telephone at richards doraville home said 
richard would not comment repeated calls were made to dunbars home 
wednesday night but his telephone was busy

admitted to the country or to remain here in the country under 
certain exceptions in ins regulations barr said were it not 
for the false representations brought by dunbar they would not 
remain in the united states

two teenagers were sentenced to at least 50 
years in prison wednesday for murdering two roman catholic priests 
in their rectories 
the trial judge state supreme court justice frederick marshall 
sentenced the pair to the maximum term and said he wished he could 
have imposed the death penalty which was abolished in new york in 
1965 
marshall told defendents theodore simmons 19 and milton jones 
18 the sentence was meant to voice the outrage and disgust of the 
community 
the two were convicted in separate trials of robbing torturing 
and murdering the rev a joseph bissonette 55 in st 
bartholomews church on feb 24 1987 and monsignor david herlihy 
74 in st matthews church on march 7 1987 
the crimes sent shock waves through the city and terrorized 
churchmen 
a clergyman from the poor neigborhood where the slayings occurred 
testified that he slept with a ceremonial sword at his bedside 
because he feared the tough youths who came to his rectory late at 
night looking for handouts 
the defense for both simmons and jones claimed that the youths 
underprivileged upbringing contributed to the crimes 
the judge rejected the argument and said the pair stripped them 
the priests of all human dignity 
in his final statement simmons who tried to blame jones for the 
killings said i did not kill anyone everything exploded in 
my face and i did not know what to do 
jones said through his attorney he was sorry for the crimes 
something happened that he got caught up in and just did not 
known how to extricate himself jones attorney jeffrey sellers 
told the judge 
relatives of the two slain priests said they were struck by a 
lack of emotion from the defendants 
nan gallivan monsignor herlihys niece said the defendants did 
not appear remorseful at any time during the trial 
raymond bissonette brother of the rev bissonette said the 
prison terms were something that had to be done 
marshall sentenced simmons and jones to two consecutive 25 
yearstolife terms which means the pair will not be eligible for 
parole until they have served 48 years counting the time they 
already have been held

navy secretary william l ball iii reversing 
the decision of several predecessors has authorized an attempt to 
recover the remains of nine aviators who died in a plane crash 40 
years ago in a remote part of canada 
cmdr jeff zakem a spokesman said wednesday that ball had 
reviewed the complete file and granted approval for a recovery 
mission to be attempted sometime next summer in a mountainous 
section of vancouver island canada 
zakem said he had no further explanation for balls decision to 
authorize the expedition 
but raymond h swentek who has led a oneman campaign for 20 
years to recover the remains of his brother and the other eight 
fliers credited personal appeals to various senators and to the 
office of vice president george bush for convincing ball to review 
the matter 
two years ago in october 1986 then navy secretary john f 
lehman rejected a recovery operation as unjustified even though the 
naval medical command had sided with swentek and recommended 
approval 
im floating on the clouds right now swentek said late 
wednesday i cant believe its finally going to happen 
swentek a washington resident and freelance consultant has been 
jousting with the navy to recover the remains of nine men who died 
on nov 4 1948 when their p2v neptune a world war iiera bomber 
crashed on vancouver island 
among the nine was ltjg edward t swentek and raymond swentek 
has long argued the navy at least owes the victims families a 
proper military burial for their loved ones 
they were out there to provide for our security and we should 
honor them properly he says and we want to bring our grief to 
an end 
until 1986 the navys response to swenteks campaign had been 
unequivocal namely the site was so inaccessible and the terrain 
so rugged that any recovery attempt would run the risk of injury to 
the men sent in 
the plane crashed into the side of a dead volcano in the canadian 
wilds in an area that is covered by snow virtually yearround the 
wreckage was not even discovered until 1961 and then only by 
accident 
the navy also maintained it honored the victims properly when a 
search party in 1962 made it to the area recovered a small number 
of bones and buried them at the site under concrete after erecting a 
plaque 
none of those arguments satisfied swentek who traveled to the 
site himself in 1985 to explore the area in the process recovering 
some small skeletal remains himself that was enough to convince the 
naval medical command to back swentek 
but when lehman studied the matter he vetoed an expedition 
saying at the time he didnt believe recovery of any significant 
remains is likely 
after that setback swentek set up a taxexempt trust to solicit 
donations for a private expedition but was never able to raise 
enough money 
in a 1986 interview with the associated press however he also 
vowed to keep fighting the navy 
im sure the navy wants to do the right thing said swentek 
himself a former naval aviator its just a matter of getting them 
off dead center im not giving up on this

police commandos stormed a 
prison where inmates had held three hostages for 45 hours and an 
official said three prisoners and a hostage were killed in the raid 
wednesday 
the assault ended a standoff that began monday night when three 
inmates jumped two guards and took their rifles at the prison in 
quezaltepeque 15 miles north of san salvador 
the inmates along with three others demanded political asylum 
in mexico in exchange for releasing the hostages a nurse and two 
prison guards 
the mexican embassy denied the asylum request on grounds the 
prisoners had been jailed for common crimes justice minister julio 
alfredo samayoa said 
one of the inmates identified as former national guard officer 
edgardo leiva lainez threatened to amputate the hostages arms and 
legs if the asylum demands were not met 
communications minister roberto viera told reporters wednesday 
that about 100 prisoners not involved in the hostagetaking tried to 
flee the prison which was surrounded by army troops 
the attempted escape provoked the six hostagetakers who threw a 
grenade and began shooting at the troops and fleeing prisoners 
viera said 
when the rioters began firing the special forces intervened 
viera said 
he said officials sent in 30 treasury police commandos after 
deciding that dialogue was impossible because of the intransigent 
attitude of the rioters 
reporters at the site saw the commandos blow open the doors of 
prison cells with charges and toss tear gas grenades inside to force 
the prisoners out 
viera said leiva two other prisoners and one of the prison 
guards held hostage were killed the guard already had been wounded 
in monday nights takeover he said 
the nurse and the other guard were freed unharmed while a 
prisoner not involved in the hostagetaking was slightly wounded 
viera said 
col miguel vasconcelos commander of the army brigade that 
surrounded the prison said another guard and a policeman were 
seriously wounded when they tried to approach the inmates monday 
night 
victor amaya fuentes assistant director of prisons said the six 
inmates involved in the takeover had been jailed on homicide and 
assault charges 
the nurse candida francisca figueroa told reporters after her 
release that i told them it wasnt correct what they were doing 
but they said they would leave the prison either alive or dead

about 100 brown university students some 
hugging friends who sobbed gathered wednesday to protest two recent 
rapes near campus and tell their own horror stories of sexual 
violence 
police said both rape victims were attacked near the ivy league 
campus within two weeks of each other last month the assaults 
spurred appeals to female students to take the campus shuttle or 
walk in groups 
providence police and brown security officials say they believe 
the same man may have been invovled in both rapes since both women 
were attacked at knifepoint as they were walking alone at night 
they have declined to elaborate on the similarities and will only 
say their investigation is continuing 
police have passed around flyers warning women of the attacks and 
giving them tips on how to protect themselves 
about 25 people spoke at the demonstration including some who 
talked about being raped by family members brothers of friends 
friends of the family and others 
most speakers criticized what they described as a society of men 
who think when a woman smiles at them she wants sex and family 
members who blame women for incest and date rapes 
they said they were also tired of not being able to walk where 
they want and wear what they want 
im not going to say i cant because thats like having 
something stripped away from me said beth bird a senior who 
said she wants women students to form a counterterrorist group 
to fight back against men who try to assault them 
kathy hathaway a brown senior and organizer of the speakout 
said she and some classmates taking the campus shuttle at night are 
angry their freedom is restricted 
i resent the fact of feeling powerless she said when i 
walk out of the library at night theres a dilemma its not an 
automatic decision to take the shuttle 
hathaway said the speakout was held to allow people to air their 
feelings 
on campus and in the providence community as a whole theres 
been so much emotion but no forum to release the emotion 
hathaway said we wanted to provide that arena 
the speakout was to be followed by a 30minute take back the 
night allwomen march near the scene of the two rapes and a 
candlelight vigil on the campus green men would be allowed to 
participate in the vigil she said

more britons condemn homosexuality and favor 
stricter morals possibly in reaction to the spread of aids an 
independent research group said thursday 
the findings were part of a survey of 2847 britons conducted in 
1987 by the independent social and community planning research 
group which has published reports on social attitudes annually 
since 1983 
although we cannot be absolutely sure it seems certain that 
there is a link between stricter morals and concern over the spread 
of aids said sharon witherspoon a senior researcher and joint 
editor of the report 
our analysis shows that the type of person who tends to be less 
sympathetic and more censorious toward aids sufferers is exactly the 
same person who will be less liberal in their views on general 
matters of sexual morality 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer it is most often spread through sexual 
contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood 
or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring aids 
is fatal with no known cure 
the british survey found 74 percent of those polled thought 
homosexual relations were always or generally wrong 12 percent more 
than in 1983 
the number of those surveyed who thought sex before marriage was 
wrong rose from 23 percent in 1985 to 25 percent in 1987 those who 
disapproved of extramarital affairs rose from 83 percent in 1983 to 
88 percent last year 
reseachers found ambivalent attitudes on aids although 57 
percent of respondents felt that most people with aids have only 
themselves to blame about 60 percent believed that people who 
have aids get much less sympathy from society than they ought to 
get 
onethird of the respondents agreed more money should be spent on 
research into a cure for aids but less than 10 percent thought more 
should be spent on care for aids victims 
that finding indicated a somewhat chilling lack of strong 
concern for increasing the resources available for helping 
sufferers said lindsay brook a senior researcher and coeditor 
of the book 
the survey found that 60 percent of those polled believed 
teenagers under 16 should not be given contraceptives 10 percent 
more than in 1983 
the authors said the survey was carried out on a random sample of 
people living in all areas of britain except northern ireland 
interviews were conducted at respondents homes

a lawyer said wednesday the fbi has been 
retaliating against hispanic agents who successfully sued the bureau 
in a racial discrimination case 
about 25 of the 311 agents who joined the suit report being 
harassed and retaliated against since us district judge lucius 
bunton ruled sept 30 that the fbi had discriminated against 
hispanic agents said orlando quintana an albuquerque lawyer 
affiliated with the plaintiffs legal team 
quintana on wednesday was putting together a 50page affidavit to

participating in the lawsuit or commenting about it

immediately return phone calls wednesday to the associated press 
after the twoweek nonjury trial ended aug 26 bunton 
admonished the fbi not to punish any agents for joining in the suit 
or testifying on the plaintiffs behalf 
the judge noted that several agents had testified they feared 
retaliation because they said the fbis first commandment is 
to never embarrass the bureau 
in his 95page ruling bunton said the fbi had discriminated 
against hispanic agents by promoting them too slowly assigning them 
lessdesirable jobs and giving them less recognition for their 
successes damages will be decided later 
the suit was filed by bernardo matt perez the no 2 man in 
the el paso fbi office in january 1987 
in the affidavit to be filed thursday perez complains of being 
put under administrative inquiry for speaking with reporters after 
buntons verdict was announced quintana said 
fernando mata an agent in the miami field office testifies in 
the affidavit that he has been put under administrative inquiry 
ostensibly for breaching national security during his testimony 
quintana said 
mata testified aug 16 that he had done some undercover work 
involving an unidentified foreign country he also testified he was 
given the fbis highest reward in 1983 for his foreign work 
albuquerque agent james garay testifies in the affidavit that his 
bureau car and weapon were taken away as retaliation for testifying 
quintana said 
the fbi said he was under medication and as a result he 
couldnt perform properly said quintana who added that garay 
denies any medication he receives interferes with his job 
performance 
two los angeles agents paul magallenez and rudy valadez testify 
in the affidavit that they have been put under administrative 
inquiry for talking to a reporter for california magazine quintana 
said the agents are quoted in the article as saying the los angeles

democrat michael dukakis slammed republicans 
george bush and dan quayle as sorry candidates to lead a war against 
drugs and warned drugproducing countries that if youre against 
us dont expect a dime of american foreign aid 
unleashing some of his harshest campaign rhetoric yet dukakis 
criticized the vice president for saying tuesday he would not 
necessarily halt aid to nations that refuse to cooperate with us 
antidrug efforts 
mike dukakis will you can depend on that the democratic 
presidential nominee told about 10000 people at a rally in 
chicagos daley plaza 
thats an important difference in this election and will make a 
very important difference in the lives of our children and 
grandchildren he said 
dukakis drew thunderous applause when he declared 
ill work with other countries but ill be damned if i will 
allow those countries to send their poison into the united states of 
america maybe bush thinks there are other things more important 
than the future of our children i say you have to draw the line 
somewhere 
chicago was the second stop on a threestate campaign tour 
wednesday that began in minneapolis where dukakis wife kitty is 
hospitalized 
dukakis repeated the antidrug message in pittsburgh where he 
addressed a rally of several thousand people he mocked bush for 
wanting to be a tough guy but failing to back up his words with 
actions 
you have to draw the line somewhere and i draw that line at 
the lives of our children dukakis said again criticizing bushs 
statement tuesday 
showing signs of fatigue dukakis mistakenly referred to former 
interior secretary james watt as a former secretary of state 
dukakis capped the day in philadelphia where he attended a 
getoutthevote rally with the rev jesse jackson 
jackson introduced dukakis and made frequent references to bushs 
line of read my lips saying that bush was part of the reagan 
administrations repeated failures in civil rights 
jackson brought the crowd to its feet 
when we watch your lips you watch our hips while we march and 
vote he said 
dukakis drew his best response from the crowd when asked about 
apartheid 
nelson mandela is still in jail and manuel noriega is still 
running panama he said its time that changed 
during the primary campaign dukakis said he would refuse to give 
foreign aid to any country involved in producing or trafficking in 
illict drugs unless they cooperated fully with the us campaign to 
stamp out the drug trade 
the same policy is reflected in federal law but dukakis and 
congressional democrats have criticized president reagan for 
certifying panama and other suspect countries as eligible for 
foreign aid 
dukakis said he would offer money protection and even us 
military assistance to countries that request help in the drug war 
if youre against us dont expect a dime of american foreign 
aid he said if you think you can do to mike dukakis what 
panamanian leader manuel noriega did to george bush if you think 
were going to risk our childrens lives by putting someone like dan 
quayle in charge of the war against drugs then youre in for a big 
surprise on jan 20 1989 
mark goodin a bush spokesman accused dukakis of distorting 
bushs views 
the vice president would never hesitate to use aid as a lever 
on the war on drugs goodin said however he rejects the 
approach that is simplistic and dangerous of unilaterally cutting 
off foreign aid as a remedy of first resort and in doing so 
completely removing any leverage and control the united states has 
with these countries 
dukakis sharp attack came as he struggled to narrow bushs 
doubledigit lead in national polls in the final days of the 
campaign his campaign aides dispute the poll figures saying their 
internal data show a bush lead of about seven percentage points 
advisers to the massachusetts governor also say the race is 
tightening in several large pivotal states including illinois 
dukakis suggested at the chicago rally that next tuesdays election 
is still up for grabs because of a large bloc of undecided voters 
dukakis took issue with bushs recent claim that dukakis and 
running mate lloyd bentsen were waging a divisive campaign 
this is the same fellow who commended ferdinand marcos for his 
commitment to democracy the guy who called james watt an excellent 
secretary of the interior the fellow who said robert bork was an 
outstanding appointment to the supreme court of the united states 
the fellow who picked dan quayle to be vice president of the united 
states dukakis said 
his aides defended dukakis in commenting on reports that 
massachusetts had overdrawn one of its bank accounts by as much as 
190 million because of lagging revenue collections and that the 
state pension fund had invested money in a pool involved in a 
hostile takeover attempt against rjr nabisco 
dukakis adviser thomas herman said the states pension money 
which is routinely invested had never been used in a hostile 
takeover 
he said the state ordered the pool administrators not to use 
massachusetts funds in the rjr nabisco deal because nabisco has ties 
to south africa and massachusetts has a law prohibiting such 
investments

foreign minister jorge ritter on 
wednesday ridiculed a us southern command report that marine 
sentries exchanged gunfire with unidentified intruders at a fuel 
storage depot near an american air base 
its absolutely beyond reality that there was an armed 
confrontation ritter said on national television 
it seems unlikely that after two hours of shooting they werent 
able to find a trace of a person or a man wounded or a death or a 
trace of munitions in the area 
according to the command sentries at arraijan tank farm near 
howard air base traded shots with intruders onandoff for almost 
two hours monday night no one was hurt the command said 
the gunfire began when 11 marines in listening posts heard 
movement voices and visually confirmed the presence of armed 
intruders in the jungle the southern command said it said the 
incident was under investigation 
panamas defense forces are commanded by gen manuel antonio 
noriega the countrys de facto leader noriega is under criminal 
indictment in the united states on drug trafficking charges he 
denies the charges 
the reagan administation unsuccessfully has sought noreigas 
ouster through economic sanctions and negotiations 
sentries have reported several intrusions at us military 
facilities in panama this year 
on april 11 a marine sentry was accidentally shot and killed by 
fellow guards at the 807acre tank farm as they investigated the 
first reported intrusion 
the fuel storage depot is in a hilly jungle area about five 
miles west of panama city 
the southern command responsible for all us military 
operations in latin america reported four intrusions in april at 
us military installations in panama by what one spokesman called 
highly trained professionals 
in july american soldiers exchanged gunfire with unidentified 
intruders on two occasions at arraijan the command said 
panamas military has said its troops were not involved in those 
incidents and suggested that nervous us sentries imagined 
intruders 
ritter claimed the latest report is part of that campaign of 
us intimidation aimed at justifying an increased us military 
presence here 
it would appear that the united states not only periodically 
has elections but also dispenses absurdities with the same 
regularity he said 
referring to the us presidential election ritter said i 
dont believe that one way or the other the situation with the 
united states is going to improve

millions of mexicans spent wednesday at 
cemeteries observing the day of the dead listening to music and 
taking gifts of flowers and food to deceased relatives who are said 
to drop by for a visit 
the small cemetery of mixquic in southeastern mexico city was 
crowded with people cleaning and adorning family graves with the 
traditional cempasuchil flowers a type of marigold 
anita ramirez 15 put flowers on the grave of brother horacio 
who died 14 years ago 
i came here to remember him even though i didnt know him

she said her parents were among hundreds of vendors selling 
everything from candy skulls to cardboard skeletons that dance when 
you pull a string 
the day of the dead which follows all souls day dates to aztec 
times it is a mix of beliefs that include the concepts that the 
dead are never far away and that the line between life and death is 
blurred 
in the weeks leading up to the day of the dead bakery shelves 
carry bread in the shape of bones and sugar skulls with the names of 
the dead and the living friends exchange poems that jokingly refer 
to each others funerals 
families make altars in their homes and adorn them with flowers 
and the favorite foods of their dead relatives the same is done at 
cemeteries where families wait to eat until they believe the dead 
have had their fill 
in recent years however many upperclass mexicans adopted 
halloween garb and practices instead including plastic masks and 
pumpkins 
miguel angel munez 24 was putting flowers on the grave of his 
father who died 14 years ago 
we come here on this day to be with the people we love they 
say they come back this day and we can be with them munez said

a picture of jesus as centerpiece and offerings of fruit bread

george bush said wednesday the next president should reflect the 
hopes and dreams of voters and proudly proclaimed i am that 
man michael dukakis urged supporters to keep pouring it on in 
a drive for an election day upset 
the democratic underdog also ripped into bushs record on the 
drug war and said ill be damned before giving foreign aid to 
countries not helping the cause 
bush the leader in all the polls said there was a great 
divide separating himself from dukakis on many issues he 
proclaimed that his own election would mean a mainstream mandate 
for the next four years 
gop vice presidential candidate dan quayle a foe of abortion 
said he had no quarrel with a medical procedure he described as 
aimed at preventing conception after rape asked pointedly whether 
he would expect a rape victim to bear a child that resulted from 
such an attack he said hopefully they would seek medical 
attention immediately and under normal medical procedure life and 
conception would not even begin 
the national candidates made their rounds six days before the 
voting while all around them the pace of campaigning quickened 
senate republican leader bob dole was going to three states 
during the day in a bid to help endangered gop candidates for 
congress sen edward kennedy countered for the democrats by 
campaigning in minnesota where hubert h humphrey iii is a senate 
race underdog 
officials in both parties agree democrats are likely to retain 
control of both houses of congress after next weeks balloting 
although republicans harbor hopes of winning enough close senate 
seats to reduce the current 5446 democratic advantage 
dukakis and his running mate lloyd bentsen both criticized 
quayle bentsen said bush had shown real disdain disregard for 
our country by tapping the indiana senator to join his ticket 
dukakis said putting quayle in charge of the drug war would be 
risky for americas kids 
bush defended his 41yearold political partner saying he had 
been through the fire and his head is up and his chin is up 
president reagan campaigned in wisconsin and ohio scoffing at 
dukakis claims to being a democrat in the harry truman mold ill 
tell you one thing if hes harry truman im roger rabbit said 
the republican campaign surrogateinchief 
john howard in owensboro ky set up a sort of drivethrough 
poll at his crickets classy car wash and said the results were 
about even customers could drive into a bay named for the 
presidential candidate of their choosing its very scientific 
he said the margin of error is 100 percent 
as usual dukakis aides said their private polls were 
encouraging as usual the public polls seemed to be pointing to a 
republican victory next tuesday abc said its latest illinois survey 
was a dead heat but bush led in other surveys from ohio arkansas 
and connecticut 
bush campaigned through illinois and michigan two key midwestern 
battlegrounds 
at his first stop at adlai stevenson high school outside 
chicago he instructed an audience made up largely of students how 
to make an election day choice 
youre not going to make your decision on some television 
advertisement or some sound bite and what i want you to do is 
look beyond the charges get past the shouting and choose as 
president the person who represents your values your dreams your 
hopes for the united states and i am that man 
he returned to the theme later in grand rapids mich i 
represent the mainstream the mainstream views and the mainstream 
values if i win it will be a mainstream mandate thats what this 
election is all about he said 
bush also said dukakis was conducting a media blitz 
appearing on every television show except wheel of fortune he 
was afraid that vanna might turn over the lword 
dukakis began his day in minnesota by visiting his wife kitty 
who is hospitalized for an upper respiratory infection 
at a downtown rally the massachusetts governor urged supporters 
to keep pouring it on and pouring it on as he summoned up 
memories of harry trumans upset victory of 1948 john kennedys 
closely won contest of 1960 and hubert humphreys narrow defeat in 
1968 
later in chicago he employed some of the harshest rhetoric of 
the campaign against his rival maybe bush thinks there are other 
things more important than the future of our children he said 
i say you have to draw the line somewhere he said to other 
nations dont expect a dime in foreign aid without help on the 
drug war 
and at a getoutthevote rally in philadelphia with jesse 
jackson dukakis drew his best applause when answering a question 
about apartheid nelson mandela is still in jail and manuel 
noriega is still running panama its time that changed 
despite dukakis campaign aggressiveness aides spent part of the 
day defending the governor from reports that massachusetts has 
overdrawn one of its bank accounts by as much as 190 million 
because of lagging revenue collections and that its pension fund had 
money invested in a pool that had been involved in a hostile attempt 
to take over rjr nabisco 
dukakis also aired new television commercials nationally that 
originally were tailored for california one says the democrat wants 
an america that exports its products not its jobs in another 
he says he wants clean air and clean water and clean coasts and a 
clean government in washington dc 
quayle was asked the question about abortion while campaigning in 
memphis tenn he said if a rape victim underwent a procedure known 
as dilation and curettage immediately after being raped he would 
not construe that as being an abortion 
dr robert shesser an emergency care specialist at george 
washington university medical center in washington said the 
procedure described by quayle is not the standard postrape medical 
treatment he said that once doctors determine that conception has 
taken place a woman is offered a morning after pill aimed at 
ending pregnancy

president reagan exercised pocket vetoes 
wednesday on a bill designating 143 million acres of forest service 
land in montana as wilderness as well as on a measure establishing a 
corporation to provide development capital to indian businesses the 
white house announced 
by exercising the pocket vetoes after congress adjourned for the 
year there is no chance of overrides 
in a statement concerning the montana wilderness bill reagan 
said enactment of the bill would injure the economy of montana 
it could cost jobs and eliminate vast mineral development 
opportunities it also would reduce the flexibility the federal 
government needs in managing the nations natural heritage 
sen max baucus dmont who cosponsored the measure with 
fellow montana democratic sen john melcher accused reagan and vice 
president george bushs presidential campaign of playing politics 
with the bill 
this is an affront to the people of montana baucus said 
wednesday night in a statement read by press secretary scott 
williams this bill was vetoed for petty politics and thats all 
clearly the bush campaign had a hand in this the vice 
president is still a member of the environmental wrecking crew 
the wilderness bill passed by voice vote in both chambers of 
congress the senate on oct 18 and the house on oct 20 would 
have affected more than 6 million acres of montana and was the 
result of a compromise worked out among competing interests 
including conservationists and the timber and lumber industries 
the measure designated about 143 million acres of forest service 
land as wilderness 360400 acres as special management areas 
meaning recreation and 320700 acres as federal study areas it 
also released for nonwilderness uses such as timber harvesting 
and mineral exploration another 4 million acres in montanas 10 
national forests 
reagans veto was lauded by a northwest montana logger bruce 
vincent who called it a real victory for the citizens of montana 
and the families and communities who had a lot at stake 
also supporting the veto was conrad burns the republican running 
against melcher for a senate seat burns said the bill was vetoed 
not for political reasons but because it would cost jobs in montana 
if there were any politics involved in this it was john 
melcher holding this bill up all year long and introducing it in the 
11th hour without holding hearings on it burns said in montana 
melcher criticized burns as the one playing politics saying 
we dont really need to make this political weve had a hard 
enough time passing a bill with all the competing interests in 
montana to add another dimension with the white house well 
its pretty tough 
reagan said the administrations national forest system land and 
resource management plans for montana already strike the appropriate 
balance among competing economic environmental and cultural 
interests the legislation he said would have severely disrupted 
that balance 
in addition the president said the measure would have limited 
the governments ability to obtain strategic and critical minerals 
necessary to supply military industrial and essential civilian 
needs during national defense emergencies 
reagan argued that the federal government would have given up 
revenueproducing land in favor of nonrevenueproducing land thus 
increasing the federal deficit 
the president said he was withholding his approval of the bill 
creating the indian development finance corp because it would 
have created an expensive and unnecessary new bureaucracy and 
duplicated currently existing programs 
the measure to provide development capital to indian businesses 
would not have addressed the underlying problems of economic 
development for indians reagan said while placing the government 
at risk of substantial financial loss the bill does not provide 
sufficient authority for government oversight of the financial 
activities that could result in such loss 
instead of creating a new institution reagan said better use 
should be made of existing sources of capital such as the indian 
financing act he noted that he recently signed a bill which 
increased the ceiling on loans and loan guarantees under that act 
the section of the bill that transferred federal land in southern 
california to several bands of southern california mission indians 
was unaffected by the pocket veto reagan said because that also 
was included in the omnibus indian affairs bill that he approved 
earlier

john f kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy involving an 
alliance of american mobsters and the cuban government according to 
a primetime tv special wednesday night hosted by investigative 
columnist jack anderson 
there was a conspiracy to kill president kennedy and for the 
last 25 years there has been a conspiracy to cover it up anderson 
said on the live twohour program that featured old film footage 
live interviews and dramatic reenactments 
the syndicated program american expose who murdered jfk 
was based largely on previously disclosed theories and reports 
linking the nov 22 1963 slaying with the american mob and cuban 
government 
in the 25 years since the assassination scores of books 
articles and tv programs have produced a wide range of conspiracy 
theories that point the finger alternately at organized crime the 
cia and cuba 
the warren commission appointed by lyndon johnson after the 
assassination concluded that lee harvey oswald acted alone in the 
slaying the house select committee on assassinations later 
concluded that kennedy probably was the victim of a conspiracy and 
that there was a second gunman who fired at kennedy 
andersons theory is based on interviews he conducted with johnny 
roselli a las vegas crime boss and top lieutenant to the late 
chicago mob chieftain sam giancana 
roselli who was cooperating with a senate investigators when he 
was killed in 1976 told anderson and others that he learned of the 
alleged conspiracy through mob sources 
anderson believes cuban leader fidel castro wanted to kill 
kennedy after learning of alleged cia plots to kill castro and la 
cosa nostra leaders in the united states wanted the president dead 
because of his administrations crusade against the mob led by his 
brother attorney general robert f kennedy 
anderson said reputed miami mob chief santos trafficante alleged 
new orleans mob boss carlos marcello and teamsters chief jimmy hoffa 
all had motive and means to kill the president 
and he reiterated reports linking both oswald and his assassin 
jack ruby to organized crime oswald a procastro activist was 
recruited by cuba to kill jfk and ruby was recruited by mobsters to 
kill oswald according to anderson the columnist also asserted that 
ruby and oswald met in the weeks prior to the assassination 
the program also presented a private companys computer 
enhancement of photographs of kennedy concluding that the shot that 
killed him was fired from the front oswald was positioned behind 
the presidential motorcade in a sixth floor room of the nearby texas 
school book depository 
in a bizarre allegation anderson said the same photo analysts 
also concluded that a picture of three hobos near the shooting scene 
taken shortly after the killing appear to show watergate conspirator 
e howard hunt and james earl ray the killer of martin luther king 
jr hunt denied that charge on the show anderson gave no 
explanation of their alleged connection 
the program also featured live interviews with marina oswald 
porter oswalds who testified before the warren commission she 
said she felt manipulated by the commission to make lee a guilty 
party i was very young and immature and naive 
anderson also charged that johnson covered up the conspircy 
fearing public disclosure of the alleged cia plots to kill castro 
would provoke a world war with the soviet union he provided no 
evidence to back up that claim

undersecretary of state michael h armacost complained to soviet

political pollsters have plied their trade in 
stormy weather in the presidential elections final weeks buffeted 
by complaints that their work is distorting the campaign and 
alienating voters 
democrat michael dukakis has led the criticism not 
surprisingly for hes trailed george bush in the polls but 
republicans also have questioned the effect on the race of the 
emphasis on poll results 
the question is whether these polls are giving the impression 
to the american people that their vote doesnt matter frank j 
fahrenkopf jr the republican party chairman said tuesday there 
is that danger 
the public as well is down on the polls in recent gallup 
surveys 45 percent said reporting whos ahead in polls is bad for 
the country as many said polls do not improve press coverage of the 
election and even more said polls should not be reported in the 
final weeks of a presidential campaign

the western put hollywood into the movie 
business and kept it there consistently pulling audiences into 
theaters over the decades 
its therefore fitting that the story of hollywood a new 
series starting saturday on turner network television opens with 
homage to western and gangster films 
future episodes will look at war movies b movies blockbusters 
the coming of sound hollywood and sex the communist scare of the 
1950s the dream factory and hollywood today 
in 1903 only two years after the real event the great train 
robbery celebrated butch cassidy and the sundance kid in a 
12minute movie the longest motion picture ever in 1969 butch 
cassidy and the sundance kid starring paul newman and robert 
redford enhanced the legend and won four oscars 
it was another western the squaw man in 1914 that settled 
the movie industry in hollywood the cecil b de mille feature not 
only brought other filmmakers west but for the first time also gave 
the western a seriousness beyond the saturday morning shoot em ups 
burt reynolds is host of the hollywood history series which was 
produced by the british broadcasting co in association with tnt 
tnt is the new cable network started by entrepreneur ted turner 
to showcase the huge library of mgm movies he owns plus original 
movies and specials made for the network 
if some of the movie titles seem unfamiliar its because bbc has 
used the english titles ride the high country for instance is 
called guns in the afternoon 
the series will unfold over five consecutive saturdays with each 
episode divided into two onehour parts this saturday the story of 
the western is followed by one on gangster films 
its an affectionate largely uncritical survey it offers more 
old footage than insight but whether youre a movie buff or just a 
casual viewer its worth a look it includes a lot of historical 
film plus generous clips from movies and interviews with 
moviemakers 
director richard brooks for instance explains how gangster 
films evolved from melodramas to dramas the difference he 
explains is that if you point a gun at someone and it misfires 
thats melodrama if you point a gun at somebody then cant pull the 
trigger thats drama 
the first alltalking picture was lights of new york in 1928 
in which a chorus girl became involved with gangsters the reviews 
called it primitive and crude but it has historical 
relevance 
gangster films which cast such stars as edward g robinson 
james cagney and humphrey bogart as antiheroes were a reflection 
of the cynicism and desperation of the depression era of the 
1930s the series says later with the repeal of prohibition the 
gman became the new hero 
movies like the naked city in 1948 brought realism to crime 
films while bonnie and clyde was the first antiestablishment 
crime movie and the godfather used the world of crime as a 
metaphor for american life 
hollywood fearing the loss of its european market held off 
supporting the allies in world war ii until pearl harbor 
thereafter the film industry threw itself wholeheartedly into 
support of the allied cause movies backed the war effort at the 
front at sea in the air behind enemy lines and at the home front 
the series also looks at the rise of the director as the dominant 
figure in filmmaking the crumbling of the big studios the 
communist scare of the 1950s the new generation of schooltrained 
moviemakers and the soaring costs of making feature films 
from the beginning hollywood battled the censors sex attracted 
audiences but it also attracted moralists determined to keep sex 
out of the movies a 1903 epic called doloritas passion dance 
was the first movie to come under attack by the censors 
mae wests ribald comedies are credited with saving paramount 
from bankruptcy but they also inspired formation of the roman 
catholic churchs league of decency the studios were forced to set 
up their own system of selfcensorship through the production code 
the industry adopted more lenient movie ratings with a new age of 
permissiveness in the late 1960s

a tiny investment club in the midwest 
appropriately named esp expects to see its stock portfolio 
expand by about 13 percent as a result of philip morris cos 
mammoth 13 billion takeover of kraft inc 
the group which consists mostly of retired couples from 
columbus ohio bought a block of kraft stock three years ago for 
around 36 a share when the company was still known as dart amp 
kraft explained member lavonne raney 
but contrary to what its name might imply none of esps members 
could have sensed philip morris would be snapping up those shares 
now for 106 apiece in cash giving the club about 7000 in 
winnings as mrs raney puts it 
its a little bit like the lottery if you want to be 
cynical about the whole thing a few lucky people are winning the 
rest arent said larry biehl cofounder and director of bailard 
biehl amp kaiser a san mateo calif investment advisory firm

are envious of the potential windfall awaitikcpqt

and other recent giant takeover targets such as rjr nabisco inc or 
pillsbury inc theres no big rush to play wall streets takeover 
game 
they term most individual investors in america as longterm 
planners who might be saving for retirement or their childrens 
college education thats opposed to those who might dash off to 
their discount brokers minutes after reading of a takeover battle or 
getting a tip 
the planning client is an entirely different animal than the 
transactionoriented client explained hank madden a financial 
planner in ids financial services incs jacksonville fla office 
the planning client strategically moves they do not get caught 
up in the turmoil of the daily tactical moves of the market 
transactionary clients will deal with a reactionary perspective 
tim lucum a retired seattle pharmacist who belongs to an 
investment club similar to esp puts himself mainly in the first 
category he says his group which calls itself the deadenders 
wont be trying to guess where the next big takeover will take 
place but rather looks for what it considers to be undervalued or 
recessionproof stock 
we have a stock selection guide lucum explained we are 
looking at what the company has done in the past 10 years if we 
think a stock will double in about five years well buy it 
lucum said his club made a special exception in buying gillette 
co stock when the personal care giant was involved in a battle 
over control of its board of directors the proxy fight pressured 
the stock higher but even so lucum thought the shares were a good 
longterm value 
jay goldinger who runs the beverly hills calif investment 
firm capital insight inc says the latest takeover craze which 
includes a 20 billion bid for rjr nabisco from kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co and a 523 billion bid for pillsbury from grand 
metropolitan plc may not be affecting individual investors so much 
because many have bought into stock or bond mutual funds 
the individual goes into a mutual fund these days and doesnt 
tend to react its mostly institutional investors that are 
involved he said 
madden agreed adding i think the average investor is very 
illinformed they look at whats happening with kraft and say how 
is that going to affect me im not going to get a discount on 
cheese 
on the other hand institutional investors which include many 
large pension funds and insurance companies are far more 
sophisticated and tend to buy and sell large blocks of stock 
still biehl says the takeover frenzy is reviving excitement in 
the stock market after several months in the doldrums 
it puts the market back on the front page he said people 
were looking at the market after the oct 19 1987 crash as being 
something like boxing they suspect its fixed 
what were seeing lately is some heavyweight matches

liu xigui is a gritty peasant who struck 
it rich by parlaying a beatup truck into a flourishing transport 
company 
now he wants to join the communist party and has clearly 
befuddled authorities who now must decide whether a millionaire 
entrepreneur by chinese standards should join the vanguard of the 
proletarian masses 
its a question the party never had to address since its 
founding in 1921 the official xinhua news agency said in a recent 
report on liu 
but the question seems inevitable in the china of leader deng 
xiaoping where private enterprise has been encouraged for the past 
decade to help develop the country 
liu 34 first applied for party membership in 1986 but a final 
decision has been delayed as his test case is debated by officials 
throughout the country local communist officials believe a ruling 
may come by the end of the year 
if any millionaire can gain entrance to the party liu appears an 
ideal candidate 
a farmer in the rural outskirts of shenyang a gray industrial 
center of liaoning province in northeastern china liu scrapped 
together 7000 yuan 1882 in 1979 to buy a used truck and go into 
the transport business the investment included money earned by 
selling his blood 37 times 
lius enterprise prospered and grew to its current size of almost 
50 trucks and 260 employees he has about 52 million yuan 14 
million in assets and claimed this years net profit will be 
roughly 2 million yuan 538000 
but liu draws a monthly salary of only 500 yuan 134 and lives 
with his wife and son in a simple home where the floor tiles are 
broken and loose and the only sign of consumer extravagance is a 
japanesemade doublecassette tape player and television 
although his income far exceeds the national annual average of 
about 1000 yuan 270 per person in urban areas most of lius 
profits dont reach his pockets 
instead the money goes to the government in taxes is reinvested 
in the company or is donated liu explained in a recent interview at 
his office 
the donations which this year have reached about 140000 yuan 
37600 are handed out for schools road repairs local welfare 
programs and sporting teams he said 
liu dressed in a blue blazer and working on his daily pack of 
old porcelain cigarettes explained why he would be a good addition 
to the party 
one reason is to add some blood to the communist party he 
said another would be to show the world that the emerging class of 
private entrepreneurs has secured a place in chinas ruling 
party 
a lean man with thin moustache who untiringly works to make his 
company successful liu added that joining the communist party would 
help him develop his business but he claimed a higher purpose for 
applying for membership 
the purpose of entering the party is to make a contribution to 
the country im not afraid of the restrictions of party 
discipline i only want to contribute to socialism he said he 
would willingly surrender his property to the government if so 
ordered 
local party officials who grew up with liu seem to view him as 
a folk hero and support his application although they said the 
final decision must be made by the shenyang city party committee 
xinhua reported some party members believe that most of the 
property of the millionaires was acquired by squeezing the surplus 
value of workers they employed thats exploitation they said 
they contend it is ridiculous to think that an exploiter with 
large amounts of surplus value could become a communist and devote 
his life to the elimination of the exploitiation system 
such sentiment certainly reflects the communists traditional 
attitude toward the wealthy when the party came to power in the 
1940s confiscation of property from landlords was a key to winning 
support in the countryside as recently as the 196676 cultural 
revolution people were persecuted just for being rich 
but li junku the party chairman in taoxian village where liu 
lives argued that the critical factor is not how much money one 
makes but how the profits are allotted 
hundreds of party members have written to the liaoning provincial 
party committee in support of liu xinhua said including many who 
believe private businessmen should not be rejected just because they 
have accumulated more personal property than others 
i believe im a socialist a rich socialist said liu who 
stressed he has prospered by following the policies of chinas 
marketoriented reforms 
from my own point of view i dont want personal gain by 
joining the party liu said but he believes successful 
businessmen now have a role to play in plotting chinas future 
development

for nearly two years viraj mendis has 
not stepped outside an anglican church in manchester to do so he 
says means he will be deported to his native sri lanka and certain 
death 
he sleeps in the ministers tiny robing room and dreams of 
walking in a park but he stays in the church because he believes 
the british government wont send police in to arrest him even 
though they can legally pick him up at any time 
the 32yearold political activist chose the ancient right of 
sanctuary as a last resort in his fight to keep from being sent back 
to sri lanka the island nation formerly called ceylon off indias 
southern tip 
his case has become a test for the revival of the sanctuary 
movement in britain 
if im allowed to win it would be seen as a big victory for 
sanctuary in this country and that will open up the doors mendis 
said 
mendis predicted hundreds of illegal immigrants will take refuge 
in churches and mosques if he succeeds especially since appeals 
against deportation have been severely restricted in a new 
immigration law 
mendis has lost two immigration appeals a high court judicial 
review and a court of appeal ruling he is waiting to see whether 
parliaments house of lords britains highest court will hear his 
case 
mendis took refuge in the church of the ascension in manchesters 
rundown mainly black hulme district dec 20 1986 two days after 
home secretary douglas hurd who is in charge of immigration signed 
a deportation order against him for overstaying in britain 
the tall bearded and bespectacled mendis son of a sri lankan 
tea plantation manager came to britain in 1973 on a student visa to 
study electrical engineering at the university of manchester 
he finished two years and had a visa until 1975 he said he got 
into financial difficulties dropped out of school and went to work 
he added that he became so disenchanted with the treatment of blacks 
that he joined a communist splinter group 
a member of sri lankas sinhalese majority mendis said he was 
appalled by what he considered racism in his own country against the 
minority tamils and after severe rioting in his homeland in 1983 he 
participated in several protamil demonstrations in england 
at that stage i knew if i go back to sri lanka now ive had it 
because sinhalese people who support the tamils are considered 
traitors he said 
but the home office and the courts have ruled that his fear of 
persecution is not wellfounded a contention supported by the sri 
lankan high commission which said he is free to go to sri lanka 
without impediment 
however the human rights organization amnesty international as 
well as church and refugee groups and a recent independent public 
inquiry have supported mendis saying he could face persecution 
especially from sinhalese extremists 
there is clear evidence that people who have been deported from 
britain to sri lanka during the past year have suffered torture 
said david haslam of he british council of churches race relations 
unit 
the rev john methuen rector of the hulme district said his 
church of the ascension decided to offer mendis sanctuary because 
we believe we are trying to save a mans life he said the 
congregation wasnt concerned that mendis is an atheist 
mendis and his supporters who maintain a 24hour guard at the 
church have been targets of hate mail and threatening phone calls 
the church had a bomb scare one supporter was stabbed in the back 
of the neck another was followed home and had a swastika carved on 
the top of her hand with a razor blade 
mendis said the real reason the british government wants to 
deport him is that they dont want any more black people in this 
country thats really at the heart of it and to make it worse 
im not only a black person im a communist as well 
the home office refused to comment on the case saying secretary 
hurd is content to abide by the decision of the court in this 
matter and we would hope that mr mendis would do the same 
but mendis said he wont leave the church unless the deportation 
order is lifted he sleeps on a sofa bed in the robing room and eats 
meals provided by members of the community 
the right of sanctuary was an accepted part of british common law 
until 1623 when it was abolished by parliament but the tradition of 
sanctuary in a church has held 
methuen said he doesnt believe hurd wants to go down in 
history as the first home secretary to send police into a church 
the clergyman maintained hurd has other options such as lifting the 
deportation order to allow further investigation 
mendis believes that his support in the local community and fears 
that his arrest could spark riots have so far kept police away but 
he said the home office may move against him soon because they 
want to destroy the sanctuary movement

danny glover does not hesitate to call himself an 
idealist the actor hopes he can make the real world a better place 
through the world of makebelieve 
i deal with fantasy he said i deal with the process that 
in my mind things are going to change i give that as a given it 
takes a concerted effort on all our parts to bring about that 
change 
glover has tried to do just that in different ways he was a 
student activist in the late 1960s when he attended san francisco 
state college and his involvement with the antiwar movement 
inspired him to pursue acting 
i thought drama was a way of touching people of providing them 
with information getting them to react 
in his latest film bat 21 glover plays birddog a vietnam 
war spotter pilot who must rescue a middleaged officer gene 
hackman who is stranded in enemy territory the movie centers on 
their relationship which develops without their ever setting eyes 
on one another 
the experience of not being able to see hackman reminded glover 
of an exercise from his theatrical training 
youre blindfolded and someone leads you around and talks to 
you they can be just having a converation with you and you cant 
see where youre going youre just listening to them and hearing 
them it heightens your other senses in doing this establishing a 
relationship wuith just trust in listening and hearing 
the key to acting is just listening 
glover brought this approach to bat 21 
i would sometimes read some of the lines to gene and put myself 
in the position where i couldnt see what he was doing glover 
said i used the intonations with his voice used whatever he 
brought to the situation to try to ascertain what was happening 
the rock star stevie wonder once made a group of critics listen 
to his new record blindfolded so they could hear the music the way 
he did without the benefit of sight 
a perfect example if you use stevie glover said hes able 
to interpret who you are what youre about just by listening to 
you hell say i saw aretha franklin his interpration of seeing 
is hearing the words and being affected by the words 
glover the son of postal employees grew up in san francisco 
through an actors workshop in the mid70s he met south african 
playwright athol fugard and appeared in four of his plays notably 
master harold and the boys 
his first major film role came in 1984 when he appeared as sally 
fields farmhand moze in places of the heart he played a 
heavy in witness and starred as a cop in lethal weapon he 
received an academy award nomination for his role of mr in the 
color purple the film version of alice walkers bestselling 
novel 
although mr whoopi goldbergs abusive husband was widely 
regarded as evil and drew criticism for its negative portrayal of a 
black male glover felt sympathy for the character 
i try to instill in every character im involved with a sense 
of completion a sense of many facets i dont think that mr 
defined himself as being a bad person he said 
glover sought to understand the origins of his characters anger 
i said to myself that he wanted to feel good about himself 
he said he wanted to feel loved he wanted to feel close to 
someone he was capable of loving and feeling close to his wife and 
anything short of that made him feel different 
if you think of something hard enough and in the process of 
thinking about it something diverts your attention it makes you 
upset 
in bat 21 as well glover worked hard to make his character a 
complete person 
i tried to focus on every part of him i was dealing with a man 
who had a passion for flying ever since he was a kid he certainly 
felt that he had the short end of things he had the knowledge and 
ability of white pilots but was looked over 
he had a strong sense of himself as a pilot and that maintained 
him and allowed him to go on 
glovers sense of himself comes from believing in the possibility 
of change in college that belief came from the civil rights 
movement 
watching people attacked that had a profound impact on me 
when i came to college i was open to the possibility of growing 
politically i came at a very unique time in history all of us were 
throwing away those shackles and confinement 
and after politics glover brought his idealism to the stage 
it allowed me more contact with people he said i wasnt 
distancing myself in a lot of economic theories i did stuff that i 
thought affected people they laugh they cry theyre moved by it 
nothing does that more than art

twentyfive years ago ap correspondent mike 
cochran covered the assassination of president kennedy in dallas and 
reported on the slaying and burial of lee harvey oswald and the 
murder trial of jack ruby in this article he explores the 
significance of the 25th anniversary of kennedys death and how the 
events and mysteries of november 1963 still affect us all 
</TEXT>

as air force one began its descent into carswell 
air force base president john f kennedy glanced down through the 
darkness amber lights silhouetted the fort worth skyline and gave 
the city a friendly festive glow 
spectacular kennedy told congressman jim wright 
the date was nov 21 1963 and the presidential party had flown 
to fort worth for the third stop on a whirlwind tour designed to end 
the leftright squabbling among bitterly factionalized texas 
democrats and secure the state for the presidential election the 
following year 
a crowd estimated at 6000 greeted kennedy and his wife 
jacqueline at carswell and thousands more lined the motorcade 
route to the old hotel texas where the president would spend his 
final night 
a 26yearold ap reporter caught his first glimpse of an american 
president that evening and in that era of innocence was every bit 
as excited as a smalltown west texan should have been 
hours later that ap reporter joined other numbed and dismayed 
colleagues in covering the death of his president and the wounding 
of gov john b connally just days later he covered the slaying of 
lee harvey oswald and drafted for the task helped carry his body 
to its grave 
then came the 1964 murder trial of jack ruby the ides of march 
conviction a death sentence and an appellate court ruling that set 
the verdict aside ruby died of cancer before he could be retried 
through the years there were interludes with oswalds widow 
marina and turbulent intriguing bouts with his mother marguerite 
whose favorite pastime was haranguing fort worth reporters 
and always the conspiracy buffs the researchers dedicated to 
proving the warren commissions basic conclusion a lie and not a 
very convincing one at that 
they insisted oswald was not the killer or at the very least 
was not the sole triggerman 
in 1981 the conspiracies peaked with a trip to rose hill 
cemetery to dig up the body buried 18 years before in oswalds 
grave a british author had claimed we had buried an impostor a 
russian spy in fact he was wrong forensic tests at baylor 
university medical center proved it was indeed oswald 
although the echoes of gunfire in dealey plaza grow fainter with 
each passing autumn the events of november 1963 continue to touch 
us all in mystifying ways and to different degrees 
this month there will be network and cable documentaries new 
books an allnight capitol vigil and memorials by former peace 
corps volunteers and pt boat veterans millions of words will be 
written 
still kennedy family members would prefer that remembrances of 
the slain president be changed 
they have tried to get away from commemorating the day of his 
death and try to celebrate the day of his birth says melody 
miller an aide to sen edward m kennedy 
what is the significance of this 25th anniversary and the 
anniversaries that preceded it do we know the legacy of dallas or 
the lessons of 1963 
historians may one day pinpoint all this and more 
but dont bet on it

anyone old enough to read or watch television 25 years ago can 
recite from memory the events of november 22 
kennedy spoke twice in fort worth that morning first to a crowd 
of 5000 who had gathered in the rain in the hotel parking lot vice 
president lyndon johnson and connally joined him but jackie did not 
it takes a little longer to put herself together thats why 
shes prettier than we are the president joked with the cheering 
crowd 
inside kennedy addressed a soldout chamber of commerce 
breakfast in the hotels grand ballroom that group totaled 2050 
with 50 extra tickets allotted at the last minute to the black 
community 
no blacks no breakfast speech the white house said when told 
the president would be addressing an allwhite audience 
it was kennedys final speech but jackie stole the show looking 
lovely and selfassured in a twopiece pink suit with matching 
pillbox hat 
kennedy and his entourage then returned to carswell for the short 
flight to dallas where the president was to address a luncheon at 
the trade mart 
in dallas 200000 people many on lunch breaks jammed the 
streets to see the 46yearold president and his 34yearold wife 
smiling and waving jackie sat at her husbands side as the 
motorcade rolled through the canyons of downtown dallas 
delighted and relieved by the big friendly reception nellie 
connally the governors wife turned from her seat in front of 
kennedy and said 
no one can say dallas doesnt love and respect you mr 
president 
you sure cant he replied 
seconds later the motorcade passed in front of the texas school 
book depository and into a snipers cross hairs

the first year after the assassination was difficult for most 
americans it was a nightmare for texans particularly those living 
in dallas 
a number of publications found much to dislike about texas and 
most were mightily concerned with the socalled mood of dallas 
and the accommodation granted its farright fanatics in the 
conservative mainstream 
in an editorial headlined a year later the dallas morning 
news touched on the scathing and unjust criticism of dallas and 
observed how the city stood alone in the spotlight of unfavorable 
conspicuousness 
the editorial did not mention the small but noisy element of 
rightwingers whose agitation had prompted kennedys visit 12 months 
before 
perhaps it was unimportant what seemed to matter to the 
newspaper was that hysteria and shock had subsided and the city 
could move ahead with new resolve and high purpose 
november 22 that year fell on a sunday and a still sorrowful 
nation remembered kennedy in prayers and memorial services across 
the country 
it had been a year of memorials 
the us space flight center at cape canaveral fla was renamed 
cape kennedy but later was changed back new york changed the name 
of its international airport from idlewild to john f kennedy 
congress authorized construction of a cultural center in 
washington to be named in kennedys honor and harvard university 
announced plans for a kennedy memorial library 
by the end of the year it seemed certain that more american 
streets avenues and boulevards would be named kennedy than main

the dallas ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of the 
assassination was so brief and simple it almost slipped past 
unnoticed 
fifty people gathered for the prayer service near the spot where 
kennedy was slain a city official laid a wreath of red and white 
carnations beside the bronze marker that tells the assassination 
story 
the news was dominated by the vietnam war and the 1968 election 
pain still lingered from the slayings earlier that year of martin 
luther king jr and sen robert f kennedy

by the 10th anniversary in 1973 reporters were getting lathered 
up over watergate in dallas 500 people gathered near the 
assassination site but the top news story of the day was an 
18minute gap in a nixon white house tape recording 
the jfk focus in 1973 was shifting to conspiracy theories fed by 
books and a movie called executive action that laid blame for 
the kennedy killing on a group of greedy texas oilmen 
theres nothing new my view is the same oswald did all the 
shooting retired district attorney henry wade said in an 
interview last month i havent seen anything to change my mind i 
feel like somebody might have planted the seed or thought that 
somebody ought to kill him kennedy while in town but there is 
absolutely no proof of anything like that 
fifteen years ago wade who would have prosecuted oswald had he 
lived was less certain 
i find it hard to believe that oswald didnt have help he 
told the ap in 1973 call it a gut feeling on my part i dont 
have any evidence to back it up but i believe there was a 
conspiracy you just dont go downtown one morning and kill the 
president 
the widow of jd tippit the police officer oswald shot after 
fleeing the school book warehouse had remarried by the 10th 
anniversary a lawyer said the 600000 she received from a 
sympathetic public after tippits death went into a trust for their 
three children

unlike the spartan fifth anniversary the landmark 20th touched 
all bases 
movies television specials documentaries books magazine 
articles and news stories explored the assassination anew 
in 1963 marina oswald at age 22 was a stranger in a foreign 
land a frightened young woman with few friends no money no job 
no future two infant daughters and a dead husband accused of 
killing the president of the united states 
it was horrible she told the ap 20 years later 
for a while i thought it would all blow over just go away but 
now i accept the fact that i must live with this for the rest of my 
life 
less than two years after the assassination marina married 
kenneth porter a carpenter and they moved to a country house north 
of dallas 
she was then and remains today uncertain of oswalds guilt and 
whether he acted alone she initially agreed with the warren 
commission that oswald was the lone assassin but doubts crept in 
and she later changed her mind 
but she told the ap i dont have any desire to waste the rest 
of my life trying to prove something that cannot be proven 
there are those however who are obsessed with doing precisely 
that 
in 1983 an ap story first pulled together theories about the 
black dog man the umbrella man the mafia con man the tall tramp 
and a man called frenchy the article also looked at publications 
called the continuing inquiry coverups and echoes of 
conspiracy 
those are names and newsletters wellknown to the selfdescribed 
theorists or critics who claim there is a sinister and still 
secret story behind the assassination 
they raise provocative questions but provide few answers 
that brings us to the 25th anniversary and the latest theories 
a british television documentary entitled the men who killed 
kennedy broadcast oct 25 claimed three gangsters from 
marseilles france assassinated kennedy on orders from us 
organized crime 
the twohour documentary on central television identified the 
purported assassins by name and said one was shot to death in mexico 
in 1972 a second was working in colombias drug trade and the third 
was living in marseilles after his recent release from prison 
but the day after the program aired a marseilles newspaper 
assembled records indicating that two of them could not have been in 
dallas on nov 22 1963 one was serving on a minesweeper from oct 
16 1962 to april 16 1964 according to french navy headquarters 
and another was in a marseilles jail cell that day according to the 
justice ministry 
in addition the newspaper account quoted the navy veteran as 
saying that the third man singled out was also in jail on the day of 
the assassination 
the program was based on a fouryear inquiry by american writer 
and researcher steve rivele and the programs british director 
nigel turner 
in this country a syndicated television report is reviving the 
theory that kennedys assassination was an act of revenge by 
lousiana mob boss carlos marcello who was deported in 1961 by 
thenus attorney general robert kennedy the program presented by 
reporter jonathan kwitny was broadcast in new york nov 1 and will 
air elsewhere this month 
the report said evidence indicated that oswald and ruby had 
connections to marcello oswald through his uncle who purportedly 
worked for the marcello organization and ruby through drug 
trafficking which would have been controlled by marcello 
in a twohour television special nov 2 columnist jack anderson 
argued another theory involving the mafia that kennedy was a victim 
of underworld figures first hired by the cia to kill fidel castro 
andersons special says santo trafficante mob boss in havana before 
castro took power in 1959 doublecrossed the cia and informed 
castro 
castro then made a deal with trafficante to kill kennedy

back when the echoes of gunfire were still ringing in dealey 
plaza the media struggled to define the mood of dallas and how the 
citys rightwing tolerance might have figured in the assassination 
they apparently failed 
d magazine a slick dallas monthly unveiled its november 1988 
issue with this cover 25 years later did dallas kill kennedy 
inside there is a story entitled was dallas a city of hate 
the debate goes on 
robert h johnson jr the aps texas bureau chief who directed 
the news agencys assassination coverage wrote the aps first 
startling words 
bulletin 
dallas ap president kennedy was shot today just as his 
motorcade left downtown dallas mrs kennedy jumped up and grabbed 
mr kennedy she cried oh no the motorcade sped on 
johnson recently retired and living in new mexico remained in 
texas for six years after the shootings never once he said did he 
drive past the book depository without getting a prickly feeling 
on the back of his neck 
i still feel it he said after a visit to dallas this year 
the event has got some kind of hold on americans and many 
foreigners as well its hard to explain 
barbara womble cannot explain it either but she vividly 
remembers the look on her fifthgrade teachers face when he 
dismissed his pupils in chicopee falls mass that november 
afternoon 
just by his expression we knew something really big had 
happened she says now 
ms womble 35 now director of marketing at upscale highland 
park village shopping complex in dallas said the whole issue is 
muddled because the case has never been solved 
but to me the way to work out our emotions of guilt and regret 
is to discuss them openly and repeatedly she said they just 
dont vanish

australia for its own reasons has allied 
itself with the united states in seeking an end to global farm 
subsidies although the two countries still are a long way from 
waltzing in perfect step 
meanwhile the reagan administration says the united states is 
still committed to scrapping all tradedistorting agricultural 
subsidies by the year 2000 but may consider accepting scaleddown 
goals for 1989 and 1990 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said last month that 
such interim proposals could be adopted at a meeting of the 
96nation general agreement on tariffs and trade in montreal which 
begins dec 5 
but yeutter said us negotiators would not go along with the 
interim subsidy reductions unless there is a strong gatt committment 
to pursue the total elimination of farm subsidies as part of the 
current uruguay round of trade talks 
the european economic community a longtime thorn for us policy 
makers because of its highly subsidized production and exports has 
consistently attacked as unrealistic the administrations bid to 
eliminate all farm subsidies and barriers to world trade 
another voice in the debate is the socalled cairns group a bloc 
that includes a australia and a dozen other countries working for 
the elimination of constraints on agricultural trade 
the cairns group named after the australian city is much 
closer to the goals of the united states than to the eecs policy of 
generally favoring more government assistance to agriculture and 
constraints on farm trade says an agriculture department report 
australian government officials say their number one objective 
in the gatt negotiations is to phase out farm export subsidies 
the report said australian farmers contend that their export 
revenues have been reduced because of eec subsidized grain dairy 
sugar and beef exports and us grain export programs 
the report is in this months issue of farmline magazine which 
is published by the departments economic research service 
australia it said is reducing government assistance to farmers 
even though it already has one of the lowest levels of 
agricultural protection among the developed countries of the world 
by the usda agencys reckoning and the use of producer subsidy 
equivalents or pses to measure how big a role government plays 
in the agriculture of various nations australias farmers get only 
11 percent of their gross income from government assistance 
the gross income of japanese farmers on the other hand included 
72 percent government assistance the eec 35 percent canada 31 
percent and the united states and new zealand each 25 percent 
australias manufacturing industry is well protected by the 
government says agency economist david skully agriculture on 
the other hand is taxed rather than subsidized that is he 
said australian farmers lose not gain in net payments to and from 
their government and the protected industrial sector 
the indirect costs of business tariffs to the farmers are more 
than the amount of government farm payments skully said 
earlier this year the australian government announced policy 
reforms including plans to abolish or significantly reduce 
government payments and other assistance to farmers he said the 
australian economy it was said cannot afford to engage in domestic 
or export subsidies 
skully said that under the proposed reforms australian 
assistance to agriculture would decline by 1990 to about half its 
1986 level and these reductions are unilateral and 
unconditional he said no bargaining with other countries is 
involved 
australia has a long history of protection for industry as a way 
of guaranteeing a fair wage to industrial workers skully said 
farmers who are dependent on the industrial sector for machinery 
and other goods have been hit hard by that protection 
the effective rate of government assistance to australias 
automobile industry for example is 250 percent and for mens 
clothing 100 percent he said by contrast flour milling and 
cotton ginning not only receive no subsidies they are taxed at 
about 20 percent 
argentina and new zealand in recent years are also where 
taxes on agriculture exceed government support skully said 
in such countries the cities live off the farms instead of the 
farmers living off the cities as in many nations he said 
farming is in reality a cash flow for countries that tax 
agriculture 
the australian agricultural sector is small compared with the 
farm economies of some other industrialized countries and this 
limits australias bargaining power the annual farm output of 
australia is valued at about 11 billion in us currency and 
about threefourths is exported 
in comparison us farm production is worth about 150 billion 
annually and exports account for about 20 percent 
australia is nearly as large as the contiguous united states but 
has only 16 million people about the population of texas 
nina swann an economist colleague of skully said australias 
agricultural policies reflect the countries comparative advantage 
in extensive crop and livestock operations and its dependence on 
exports 
domestically she said the sales of major commodities are 
regulated by law in effect those domestic pricing policies are a 
subsidy paid by consumers to farmers even so australian food 
prices are among the worlds lowest

after a summer when americans baked in the heat 
and watched beaches fouled by medical wastes george bush and 
michael dukakis both fought hard to convince voters they were 
friends of the environment 
bush was battling not only dukakis but a reagan administration 
record that environmental groups contend was often inimical to the 
causes of clean air land and water 
but the vice president proclaimed himself an environmentalist and 
took the battle to boston harbor blaming the massachusetts governor 
for the squalid state of the harbor 
dukakis ridiculed bushs electionyear conversion and said 
that boston harbor has been polluted for hundreds of years and 
im very proud to be the governor whos cleaning it up no thanks 
to vice president bush and the administration he is part of 
dukakis won the endorsement of the league of conservation voters 
which gave him a grade of b versus a dplus for bush 
some environmentalists said dukakis record was not unspotted 
but it was a lot cleaner than that of the reaganbush administration 
boston harbor is not michael dukakis shining moment said 
jeff webb a friends of the earth lobbyist but thats one issue 
in one state what about eight years of neglect 
arlene odonnell of the massachusetts audobon society said 
dukakis has exhibited a growing sensitivity to environmental issues 
although he still tends on bulldozervstrees kind of things to 
take the business side 
bush citing the drought forest fires and medical wastes that 
washed up on beaches called 1988 the year earth spoke back he 
called for an international conference next year to discuss global 
warming and ozone depletion 
bush said in the past few years we have not done enough to 
protect the environment i will do more 
bush claimed he was always an environmentalist and said there 
has been a long tradition of support for the environment within the 
gop from abraham lincoln to teddy roosevelt to richard nixon 
but it was the record of another republican president ronald 
reagan that gave environmentalists pause 
dukakis charged bush was a charter member of the environmental 
wrecking crew of former interior secretary james watt and other 
controversial reagan administration appointees 
environmentalists faulted reagan for his handling of the 
superfund to clean up toxic waste for not acting to curb acid rain 
and for vetoing a 20 billion authorization to clean up us 
waterways 
environmentalists say it was bushs deregulation task force that 
enabled the office of management and budget to secure veto power 
over environmental and other regulations dukakis has promised to 
revoke the reagan executive order that allows that 
bush has backed a goal of no net loss of wetlands he 
supported a ban on ocean dumping of sludge which congress now has 
ordered 
dukakis has called for protecting existing wetlands and restoring 
part of the vast endowment of wetlands that america has lost 
but his administration approved filling a swamp for a shopping 
center near attleboro a development that the reagan environmental 
protection agency went to court to block 
as governor dukakis fought to block licensing of the stillborn 
seabrook nuclear plant in new hampshire and to bar oil drilling in 
the georges bank off the new england coast as president he 
promises to block drilling off the northern california coast and the 
florida keys 
bush a pioneer of the offshore drilling industry last spring 
endorsed a moratorium on drilling in many sensitive areas off 
the california coast 
on nuclear power dukakis opposes construction of new commercial 
reactors until a new safer design is developed and ways are found 
to treat and dispose of nuclear waste 
bush says i believe nuclear power must be a part of our energy 
mix and says he will insist on the highest safety standards 
on acid rain bush promises to ask congress to cut millions of 
tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000 and to reduce 
nitrogen oxide emissions 
dukakis has said he will use authority under existing law to 
force industrial states that are major contributors to the acid 
rain problem to find solutions within three years 
both favor clean coal research to tap the nations abundant 
supply of fossil fuel 
both support a global ban on chlorofluorocarbons which are 
destroying the ozone layer

the presidential candidates staked out opposite 
sides in an often bitter debate over abortion with republican 
george bush wanting to outlaw nearly all abortions and democrat 
michael dukakis saying the government must not interfere with a 
womans choice 
bush favors a human life amendment to the constitution and would 
outlaw all abortions except in cases of rape incest or to save the 
life of the mother he opposes medicaid funding of abortions for 
poor women except to save the womans life 
prior to becoming ronald reagans running mate in 1980 bush 
opposed a constitutional amendment to overturn legalized abortion 
he once supported federal funding of abortions in cases of rape or 
incest as well as to save the mothers life 
asked in 1984 why he changed his position bush replied there 
has been i have to make a confession an evolution in my 
position theres been 15 million abortions since 1973 and i dont 
take that lightly 
dukakis who says he does not regard abortion as a good 
thing nonetheless is staunchly prochoice as governor of 
massachusetts he vetoed several bills that sought to restrict 
medicaid abortions for poor women 
as the campaign neared its end the democrat frequently singled 
out the abortion issue as a major difference between himself and 
bush 
mr bush wants the government to make what is one of the most 
personal choices a woman can make dukakis said 
i believe that a choice that personal must be made by the woman 
in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs and 
thats one of the reasons why we dont want george bush and dan 
quayle appointing new justices to the supreme court dukakis told 
a california crowd 
bush created a stir in the candidates first debate sept 25 when 
hew was asked if he favored jailing women who undergo abortions and 
doctors who perform them 
i havent sorted out the penalties bush replied but he 
added once that illegality is established theres got to be 
some penalties to enforce the law 
his campaign manager james baker iii said the next morning bush 
had decided only the abortionist should be punished not the woman 
dukakis was labeled a proabortion zealot by dr jc willke 
president of the national right to life committee the groups 
legislative director douglas johnson said dukakis says hes 
personally opposed but he wants to subsidize it on demand 
johnson pointed out that as a state legislator in 1970 dukakis 
sponsored a bill to legalize abortion in massachusetts 
antiabortion activists often turned out to protest at rallies 
held by dukakis and his running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
bushs running mate sen dan quayle of indiana was staunchly 
antiabortion on the campaign trail quayle said he would urge his 
wife but not coerce her to bear the child if she became pregnant 
by rape 
quayle also told a 12yearold childrens express reporter that 
she should not have an abortion even if she became pregnant by 
incest 
bush in his acceptance speech at the republican national 
convention in new orleans on aug 18 said is it right to believe 
in the sanctity of life and protect the lives of innocent children 
my opponent says no but i say yes weve got to change from 
abortion to adoption 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league said there is a stark stark difference 
between the two candidates and between the two parties platforms 
on abortion 
the democrats terse platform without mentioning the word 
abortion says the right of reproductive choice should be 
guaranteed regardless of ability to pay 
the gop platform contains antiabortion language in several 
sections including a plank that declares the unborn child has a 
fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed it 
endorses both a human life amendment and legislation to extend the 
14th amendments protections to the unborn 
bentsen has said he too personally opposes abortion and does 
not favor federal funding except in cases of rape incest or to save 
the mothers life but the national right to life committee and the 
national abortion rights action league both agree that bentsen has 
usually voted against restrictions on abortion funding quayle 
opposes abortion except to save the mothers life 
activists on both sides agree the next president is likely to 
make several appointments to the supreme court that could sway the 
tribunals ruling on abortion 
the current court has four justices who support the 1973 roe vs 
wade decision four who have been critical of it and one the 
newest member anthony kennedy whose views are not yet clear 
my biggest concern is the next presidents role in appointing 
at least three supreme court justices if not more said michelman 
johnson said on inauguration day next january therell be 
three proabortion justices over 80 years of age 
a human life amendment is a long ways down the road he said 
but if the democrats capture the white house dukakis could 
appoint a proabortion majority for years to come 
some 15 million abortions are performed in the united states 
annually compared with 586760 in 1972 when abortion was legal in 
only a few states 
johnson estimates that before abortions were legalized in new 
york and elsewhere in the 1960s some 200000 were performed 
illegally each year

in the battle for the white house the fiercest 
fight of all was waged over the defense budget with george bush 
pounding michael dukakis for opposing new nuclear missiles and the 
democrat firing back that the republicans have neglected our 
troops in the field while pursuing a fantasy defenseshield in 
space 
dukakis opposition to the mobile mx and midgetman missiles left 
him on the defensive while bush was claiming the inf treaty with 
the soviets the ceasefire in the persian gulf and the soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan as evidence that the reagan military 
buildup was yielding dividends 
when dukakis donned a helmet and went for a ride in an m1 tank 
the republican used the film footage for ads ridiculing the democrat 
and charging he opposed virtually every defense system we 
developed 
dukakis took to reciting a litany of the new weapons he supports 
from the stealth bomber to the trident ii missile for submarines to 
advanced cruise missiles as well as antitank and other 
conventional weaponry 
while bush was quick to pounce on dukakis opposition to the mx 
and midgetman he was slower to admit that he could not afford both 
if elected 
my secretary of defense is going to have a very difficult 
decision in which system to go forward with the republican said 
there will be plenty of difficult decisions at the pentagon for 
the next president military and congressional analysts agree the 
pentagon budget would have to be raised by at least 250 billion 
over the next five years to pay for all the new weapons in the 
pentagon pipeline 
both dukakis and bush have essentially ruled out such big 
increases bush has said the military would be subject to his 
flexible freeze on all spending except social security dukakis 
favors stable defense budgets 
its been a dirty little secret of the reagan administration 
that for the whole second term the defense budget has undergone real 
declines said kenneth adelman reagans former director of the 
arms control and disarmament agency 
after doubling in his first four years the pentagon budget has 
fallen 10 percent in real dollars since 1985 it is still 53 percent 
higher than before the carterreagan buildup 
lawrence korb a former reagan assistant secretary of defense 
said right now in defense you have a 400 billion program and a 
300 billion budget whoever gets in there is going to have to get 
that program down something will have to go 
as he came under fire from bush dukakis tempered his criticism 
of the midgetman a singlewarhead weapon favored by such democrats 
as sen sam nunn of georgia dukakis said current midgetman 
proposals are too expensive but he would work with congress to 
find a sensible affordable way to modernize landbased us 
missiles 
bush charged his opponent was viscerally uncomfortable with 
anything related to the nuclear arsenal he cited dukakis refusal 
to allow construction in massachusetts of a bakup radio network to 
allow military communications during a nuclear war 
dukakis also favors scrapping two planned supercarrier task 
forces that cost 18 billion each 
on the strategic defense initiative dukakis called for scaling 
back the research budget from 4 billion to 1 billion and said 
well continue research on strategic defenses but were not going 
to waste hundreds of billions of dollars on a system our best 
scientists say wont work at a time when were shortchanging our 
troops in the field and mortgaging our future 
but bush promised to develop and deploy sdi as fast as 
possible so that the united states would not be defenseless 
against ballistic missiles bush questioned why dukakis would spend 
a dime on sdi if he considered it a fraud 
dukakis contended that what the american military really needs is 
a conventional defense initiative to beef up frontline forces 
in europe 
bush said i believe that the administrations approach in 
rebuilding americas defenses is fundamentally correct 
but the big military buildup which actually started in the 
final years of the carter administration already is over 
building up conventional strength as dukakis promises isnt 
cheap 
adelman now vice president of the institute for contemporary 
studies said dukakis cannot save any money like he talks about 
by cutting down the strategic forces and pouring those funds into 
conventional forces theres not going to be that much to pour in 
strategic forces account for at the most 12 percent of the us 
defense budget eightyeight percent is conventional 
military analyst joshua m epstein said it is bushs figures that 
dont add up 
bush is talking about trying to drive eight lanes of traffic 
through a threelane tunnel as far as the pentagon budget is 
concerned he has just not realistically faced up to the budget 
constraints that will be imposed by congress said epstein a 
brookings senior fellow 
if youre not prepared to cut some of these glamor programs 
then things like readiness and training and personnel and 
maintenance and conventional forces are going to take a beating 
he said

social security in sickness and in health has 
been one of the democratic partys most potent political weapons of 
the 1980s 
democrat michael dukakis hoped to galvanize elderly voters once 
again with a broadbrush charge that republican george bush would 
raid the social security trust fund if elected 
bush sought to blunt the charge not only by vowing to keep his 
hands off social security but by accusing dukakis of dipping into a 
massachusetts pension fund for 27 million to help balance his state 
budget this year 
some lobbyists for the elderly are worried that regardless of 
sworn statements and good intentions social security will be a 
tempting target next year and into the 1990s for politicians trying 
to balance the federal budget 
robert strauss cochairman of the national economic commission 
which is supposed to recommend ways next spring to balance the 
budget touched off a firestorm in september by saying the only way 
to cure the deficit is to go to social security medicare and 
entitlements generally and defense 
both the dukakis and bush campaigns disavowed the statement by 
strauss a former democratic party chairman 
thirtyeight million retirees disabled workers and their 
families count on that check in the mail on the third day of each 
month from social security they will get a 4 percent increase this 
january 
the 210 billion retirement and disability program on the verge 
of bankruptcy five short years ago now is piling up huge surpluses 
its trust funds which grew to 69 billion last year will add 40 
billion more in 1988 and are expected to swell to 646 billion by 
the end of 1995 
dukakis has claimed bush will be forced to raid those trust 
funds if he is serious about cutting the capital gains tax spending 
more on the pentagon and balancing the budget 
bush has said repeatedly he will not touch social security 
if elected your president i pledge that no one will take your 
social security away from you bush says in a political flyer 
aimed at the elderly 
although social securitys trust funds technically are listed 
apart from the rest of the federal budget they are lumped together 
when the deficit is tallied 
federal law prohibits spending social securitys reserves on 
other programs but every dollar added to the trust funds reduces 
the overall deficit 
and since the trust funds must be invested in interestbearing 
us securities they reduce the amount the government must borrow 
in private markets the government uses the funds generated by 
selling bonds to social security to cover the operating deficit in 
other programs 
social security didnt save jimmy carter in 1980 or walter 
mondale in 1984 but sen bob dole rkan said it was the issue 
that cost republicans control of the senate in 1986 
bush says he deserves credit with president reagan for the 1983 
legislation that restored social securitys fiscal health 
but dukakis and others say bush shares the blame for the deep 
cuts reagan sought in social security after taking office in 1981 
as president of the senate bush cast a tiebreaking vote on may 
9 1985 for a budget freeze that would have blocked social 
securitys 1986 costofliving adjustment 
that freeze never materialized reagan after initially 
supporting it abandoned the package and it died afterwards he 
adopted the handsoff policy toward social security bush promises to 
emulate 
bush points out that dukakis voted that same year at a national 
governors association meeting in favor of a federal budget freeze 
dukakis did that but only after waging a losing effort to exempt 
social security 
dukakis did divert a 27 million surplus from a state pension 
fund this year but he says it was only after fully paying this 
years obligation and he takes credit for a 1987 reform law that 
marks the first time the state has ever set money aside for future 
pension obligations 
bushs two top economic advisers martin feldstein and michael 
boskin have been prominent academic critics of social security 
feldstein has argued that social security depresses private 
savings he also has proposed restricting costofliving increases 
to the consumer price index minus 2 percentage points 
boskin in a 1986 book too many promises the uncertain future 
of social security proposed to revamp social security to separate 
its insurance and welfare aspects 
but some democratic economists looking for ways to reduce the 
deficit are talking quietly of making more retirees pay income tax 
on social security benefits only one retiree in 10 now is taxed on 
social security

when ronald reagan entered the white house in 
1981 the national debt was under 1 trillion today it has soared 
to 26 trillion just paying the interest on that mountain of debt 
now costs american taxpayers more than 150 billion a year 
so what do vice president george bush and massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis propose to do about the deficit 
despite the republicans talk of a flexible freeze on most 
government spending and the democrats hopes of reaping tens of 
billions of dollars through tougher tax enforcement economists say 
neither presidential candidate has put forward a credible plan for 
mopping up the tidal wave of red ink 
the deficit has not emerged as a major campaign issue despite 
gloomy prognostications from some economists 
the treasury says it will pay 220 billion in gross interest on 
the public debt in 1989 but the government also earns interest on 
social securitys trust funds and other reserves the net 
interest cost to taxpayers is estimated at 1518 billion for 1989 
but there has been little pressure on bush or dukakis to fill in 
the blanks of their deficitreduction promises 
bush who in 1980 derided as voodoo economics reagans 
promise to balance the budget while cutting taxes and raising 
military spending now is following in reagans footsteps by 
promising more tax cuts and hands off social security he vows i 
will not raise your taxes period 
his socalled flexible freeze applies to all government 
spending other than social security and payment of interest on the 
national debt 
bush would limit the overall growth of other government spending 
to the rate of inflation with increases in some areas offset by 
unspecified cuts elsewhere 
its a commitment to slow the growth of government spending to 
make even better progress in reducing the budget deficit than we 
have been doing and are projected to do said michael j boskin a 
stanford university economics professor and senior bush adviser 
exactly when it would lead to a balanced budget depends on how 
well the economy does 
boskin said the annual deficit which in 1983 was the equivalent 
of 63 percent of the gross national product is already down to 32 
percent of gnp and is headed to 18 percent of gnp in 1993 even 
without the flexible freeze according to a congressional budget 
office forecast 
to critics who question how bush will achieve his goal while 
exempting social security boskin said it leaves most of the 
budget he said bush is committed to negotiating spending 
restraints with congress but he doesnt think its appropriate 
that he lay out a detailed fiscal year 1990 budget during the 
presidential campaign 
like reagan bush epouses a balanced budget amendment and 
lineitem veto authority dukakis opposes both and says the 
most important action we need to take on the budget deficit is to 
hold the line on taxing and spending 
dukakis the democratic challenger says no serious candidate 
can rule out the possibility of new taxes but says that would 
only be as a last resort his first resort is tougher tax 
enforcement 
dukakis who watched walter mondale meet his waterloo with a 1984 
campaign declaration that higher taxes were inevitable talks of 
raising tens of billions of dollars through a onetime tax amnesty 
and tougher enforcement this is not a pieinthesky formula 
says dukakis who estimates 110 billion in taxes go uncollected 
each year 
thomas herman a senior deputy issues director for the dukakis 
campaign said dukakis hopes to net 10 billion the first year and 
30 billion annually by 1993 from tax cheats 
there are only four ways to reduce the federal budget deficit 
cut spending increase revenue lower interest rates and improve 
economic performance we must do all four says dukakis 
dukakis has outlined spending cuts on the strategic defense 
initiative and some weapons programs and promised to make tough 
choices elsewhere in the budget including unspecified savings on 
agriculture welfare and health care as well as cutting back 
development of a supersonic space plane and paring support for 
nuclear fission and fusion research he rules out social security 
cuts 
alice rivlin senior fellow at the brookings institution and 
former director of the congressional budget office said both 
candidates have been quite vague about what they would do about the 
deficit neither has put out any kind of a solid plan to bring the 
deficit down 
the reason for that is there really isnt a good plan which can 
avoid an increase in taxes nobody wants to dramatize that fact 
she added 
lawrence chimerine chairman and chief economist of the wefa 
group said bush would aggravate the deficit with a series of tax 
cuts or credits he has promised from lower taxes on capital gains 
to a 1000 toddler tax credit for poor families 
dukakis might find some savings in military and domestic spending 
and bring in more revenues by beefing up the internal revenue 
service but were talking very small numbers said chimerine 
both candidates are counting on lower interest rates to help 
reduce the deficit but that is not necessarily within the 
presidents powers to deliver 
its catch22 said chimerine you cant get the drop in 
interest rates until you put forth a credible program but 
fundamentally the drop in interest rates is essentially what their 
program is 
david keating executive vice president of the national taxpayers 
union said bushs flexible freeze could work if he could get 
congress to follow it but every time the vice president is in a 
debate or public forum he seems to come up with another spending 
program 
economist michael evans said both candidates are up a tree in 
their quest for lower interest rates 
interest rates are likely to rise if the deficit rises the fed 
federal reserve board is going to have to defend the dollar next 
year and thats going to push the deficit higher he predicted 
the fed often raises interest rates to defend the dollar but this 
would also drive up the governments own borrowing costs and 
increase the deficit 
evans said no one should take comfort from the fact that the 
annual deficits have not yet derailed the 70monthold economic 
recovery 
its like that old line this is the way the world will end 
not with a bang but a wimper the deficit reduces our growth and 
productivity it diverts our assets to foreign investors said 
evans just gradually the standard of living erodes 
stephen moore an economic policy analyst at the conservative 
heritage foundation said the deficit already has come down from a 
high of 220 billion two years ago 
economic growth is pushing up tax revenues by 60 billion a year 
and if you can hold the rate of spending increases to 4 percent a 
year the budget would be balanced in 1993 he said i dont 
think theres any reason to raise taxes whatsoever 
rivlin said the deficit is even worse than it looks on paper 
because it is masked in part by the growth of social securitys 
trust funds those funds now are rising by 40 billion a year and by 
the early 1990s will be piling up 100 billion annual surpluses 
we ought to be aiming for a budget surplus by the end of the 
1990s because we need more national savings said rivlin 
rivlin said the flexible freeze idea sounds good but when you 
look at it it means medicare and medicaid would have to be cut 
substantially or youd have to cut a lot of other spending the 
big health care programs have been growing at twice the rate of 
inflation in recent years she said 
while bush has said cutting the capital gains tax rate from its 
current maximum of 28 to 33 percent down to a flat 15 percent will 
actually raise revenues not lower them the congressional budget 
office has estimated it will cost 39 billion a year in revenues 
some estimates are even higher 
bushs tax credits for child care would cost nearly 2 billion 
his taxdeferred savings accounts for the middleclass cost 70 
million to start and reach 550 million by 1993 his college savings 
bonds cost up to 200 million and a variety of other tax credits 
for rural development and the energy industry could cost up to 1 
billion more acording to democrats on capitol hill 
both bush and dukakis favor extending the research and 
development tax credit at a cost of more than 1 billion a year 
boskin said that putting aside the capital gains tax cut bushs 
other tax breaks would cost only 4 billion a year or less than 
onethird of 1 percent of outlays in 1993 
rivlin said that putting back in little special exceptions for 
this and that could eventually force lawmakers to raise the low 
tax rates achieved in the tax reform act of 1986 
bush and dukakis have another excuse for staying mum on deficit 
reduction a bipartisan national economic commission already exists 
to do some of the dirty work early next year on how to reduce the 
deficit 
both candidates disavowed a recent statement by the commissions 
cochairman robert strauss who said the only way to solve the 
deficit is to go after social security and other entitlements 
the national economic commission could help the country end its 
deficitspending binge of the 1980s but only if the new president 
wants it to said rivlin if the president wants it hell have 
lots of help

both george bush and michael dukakis talk about 
wanting to be the education president but educators say they 
have offered little to show how they would earn that title 
many expected education issues to loom large in this race and 
there was even a candidates debate last fall devoted solely to the 
topic 
but the only education issue that really caught on in this 
campaign was one that the next president will have no say over 
whether public school teachers should be compelled to lead the 
pledge of allegiance at the start of each school day 
bush made political hay over dukakis 1977 veto of a mandatory 
pledge bill that the mernor thought was 
unconstitutional 
educators remain confident that regardless of who winsassachusetts 
gov the next 
president will not propose the massive cuts in school aid and 
support for college students that ronald reagan sought 
but they say neither bush nor dukakis has done enough to 
dramatize the problems facing american schools or spelled out a 
convincing plan to improve performance 
bush the republican tells voters wherever he goes that better 
schools are the key to a better future for america 
dukakis the democrat backed by both teachers unions 
valued and honored profession again 
education faded as a central issue said ernest l boyer 
president of the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching 
we hear strong inspirational statements but the direction 
the education president would take is still not clear he said 
richard berendzen president of the american university in 
washington said both candidates deserve a dplus on education 
berendzen said 25 percent of american youths drop out of high 
school and 20 percent grow up in poverty and the united states 
often pulls up the rear on international scholastic tests 
if you take a sober look at the matter you could say that the 
preparation of our youth today and workforce readiness for the year 
2000 is one of the two or three top issues facing america said 
berendzen 
despite the generalities said college board president donald m 
stewart it is obvious both candidates are making the link between 
economic productivity and international competitiveness and the 
underserved undereducated poor 
dennis doyle a hudson institute scholar said it is inevitable 
that education will slip to the back of the presidents agenda 
education is 15th or 20th on the real list the president will 
actually keep as apart from a campaign list said doyle the 
deficit defense international relations economic problems even 
health care social security transportation and housing all are 
higher on their priority list 
while american business leaders have themselves in an absolute 
lather about education and there is an enormous reservoir of 
public interest in the schools doyle said its hard to imagine 
what kind of federal role you would craft given all the other 
demands on the presidents time and on the budget 
both have outlined ways to help families cope with the soaring 
costs of college bush with a taxfree savings bond plan and 
dukakis with a new loan program that students would repay through 
payroll deductions 
bush whose administration tried to cut 5 billion from the 
education department last year actually has proposed bigger 
spending increases than his rival 
here are their major education proposals 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
500 million for a merit schools program that would reward 
schools that raise the academic scores of disadvantaged students 
schools would get up to 100000 each to spend as they saw fit 
50 million for matching grants to create more magnet 
schools that emphasize various academic subjects 
expanding from 12 million to 50 million a proposed fund for 
innovation and reform of schools and teaching to give each state 1 
million for an experimental district trying such concepts as 
parental choice merit pay or yearround schools 
funds for head start the 12 billion preschool program for 
disadvantaged children would be increased by 250 million and up to 
1 billion over four years bush said he is commited to building 
head start to a level where all eligible 4yearolds can attend 
classes the childrens defense fund says the 453000 children now 
in head start are only 16 percent of those eligible bush wants to 
add places for 350000 4yearolds 
bush has also promised to spend more on chapter 1 a 46 billion 
remedial program that serves about 55 percent of eligible poor 
students 
congress recently passed legislation that makes good on another 
bush campaign promise taxfree interest on us savings bonds for 
college tuition starting in 1990 the tax break would be phased out 
for couples with adjusted gross incomes between 60000 and 90000 
and for single parents between 40000 and 55000 
bush also would spend 100 million to support youth service and 
volunteer activities 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
250 million for a national teaching excellence fund to provide 
college scholarships and forgive loans for those who become 
teachers launch a new national teacher corps create state teacher 
retraining centers recruit retirees to teach and a fivefold 
expansion of a 19 million christa mcauliffe fellowship program for 
talented teachers 
25 million for a citizens literacy corps to support 
volunteer efforts to teach illiterates to read 
a student tuition and repayment system stars that would 
allow students to pay back college loans through payroll deductions 
in their working years it would supplement not replace existing 
federal grant and loan programs at least at the start 
students would obtain the stars loans from banks but the 
government would collect the payroll taxes to replenish the loan 
funds dukakis officials have suggested a payback rate of oneeighth 
to onequarter of 1 percentage point of earnings per 1000 
borrowed meaning a tax of 25 percent to 5 percent for a 20000 
borrower 
the rate stays the same for low and highincome earners the tax 
would be applied on income up to the level taxed by social security 
currently 45000 the dukakis plan would allow borrowers to buy 
out their loan commitment at any time

michael dukakis has made a promise of universal 
health insurance a centerpiece of his presidential campaign and 
george bush wants to expand medicaid coverage for the poor 
but both candidates have shied away from detailed prescriptions 
for a host of other intractable medical problems that will confront 
the next president from the aids crisis to longterm care to the 
soaring costs of medicare 
health care is an issue that most americans are very concerned 
about and the candidates have not spent a lot of time on it said 
john rother legislative director for the american association of 
retired persons 
although neither bush nor dukakis has owned up to it the 87 
billion medicare program which provides health insurance for 28 
million elderly and 3 million disabled workers is almost certain 
to be a prime target of deficitreduction efforts in the next 
congress 
physicians fees under medicare have risen at a 15 percent annual 
clip and congress is already studying ways to move away from the 
traditional method of reimbursing doctors for whatever their 
customary charges are 
theyve been rather quiet about what they would do with 
medicare our concern on medicare is that you cant keep ratcheting 
that program down and expect access for the elderly to continue 
said jack owen executive vice president of the american hospital 
association 
but health analyst jack meyer said the next administration if 
theyre serious about budget control has to put health care on the 
table 
americans spent 497 billion on health care in 1987 or 112 
percent of the gross national product a far larger share of gnp 
than spent by any other industrialized country 
still 37 million americans have no health insurance most of 
them are in the workforce or depending on someone who holds a job 
but has no insurance they are not old enough for medicare nor in 
most cases poor enough for medicaid 
the ranks of the uninsured have soared over the past decade as 
insurance premiums surged in step with medical charges and as jobs 
with extensive fringe benefits disappeared in industries such as 
manufacturing 
hospitals and physicians once shifted the cost of caring for the 
uninsured onto those who could pay but in recent years both the 
government and thirdparty insurers such as blue cross have balked 
at shouldering that burden 
the paying patients are driving much harder bargains said 
meyer president of a research firm called new directions for 
policy its much harder to bury these costs in somebody elses 
bill 
here is a look at the candidates positions on uninsured people 
longterm care and aids

dukakis calling it a disgrace that the united states is the only 
industrialized country other than south africa without universal 
health insurance proposes to help 22 million of the uninsured by 
backing legislation to order all but the smallest employers to 
arrange health insurance 
dukakis has also called for a 100 million program to provide 
medical and nutritional care to 200000 pregnant women who lack 
insurance or medicaid coverage 
i want to make sure that quality affordable health care is the 
birthright of every family and citizen in this land says the 
massachusetts governor whose state last april began requiring 
health insurance with most jobs 
while dukakis has said this requirement would not cost the 
federal treasury anything bush has labeled it a 35 billion tax on 
business that could force thousands out of work 
the vice president says he wants to allow poor people to buy into 
the 32 billion medicaid program which now covers 24 million of the 
needy 
he has not offered specifics but bush promises to press for 
mandatory medicaid coverage for all children living in poverty 
starting with infants however bushs invest in our children 
package apparently includes only 200 million to 300 million more 
for medicaid 
the republican would phase in affordable coverage for pregnant 
women and infants up to 185 percent of the poverty line and 
eventually cover older children as well according to a position 
paper 
medicaid now covers less than half of all poor children leaving 
11 million unprotected a law already on the books requires states 
to cover poor infants up to age 1 by july 1990 
medicaid coverage is not cheap 
meyer estimated it would cost 8 billion to 9 billion to cover 
all uninsured poor people 
</TEXT>

with 15 million people in nursing homes costing 20000 or more 
a year longterm care is one of the biggest worries for older 
americans and their families 
bush has proposed tax incentives to encourage people to buy their 
own longtermcare group insurance and allowing people to convert 
their iras savings accounts and life insurance to pay nursing home 
bills 
for those who cannot afford insurance bush favors easing 
medicaid requirements so they dont have to spend their life savings 
before becoming eligible 
dukakis has endorsed rep claude peppers 7 billionayear plan 
to provide firstdollar coverage of longterm care at home 
pepper the florida democrat would pay for this coverage by 
levying the 145 percent payroll tax for medicare on all wages 
instead of ending it at 45000 effectively raising the payroll tax 
for 8 million workers 
dukakis has suggested guaranteeing medicaid coverage for those 
who first exhaust private longterm insurance benefits

bush says we may have to spend even more than the current 1 
billion budget for the fight against the deadly virus but money 
alone wont stop aids he says education is crucial including 
giving students the facts in a thoughtful sensitive manner he 
favors allowing those with the aids virus to stay in school or on 
the job 
bush supports legislation that would make it a crime to 
discriminate against aids patients and those infected with the 
virus he said aids test results must be kept appropriately 
confidential 
dukakis supports a 1 billionplus aids research and education 
budget as well as antidiscrimination legislation 
as president i will educate the public about both the facts 
and the myths of this terrible disease he said children should 
be taught about the disease as part of a comprehensive health 
education program beginnning in the early grades

many american farmers have endured tough times 
during the reagan era capped by a withering drought that played 
havoc with crops in this election year 
but that same drought has driven up prices and mopped up 
surpluses and that could strengthen republican george bushs appeal 
for farm votes that many politicians thought once were locked up for 
michael dukakis and the democrats 
in agriculture bush sees a rural america on the mend and headed 
for greater prosperity built around a freemarket philosophy 
dukakis sees a rural economy still seriously ailing and in need 
of government help to support the family farmer and guarantee 
reasonable prices for crops 
the difference between the two is bush is happy we think 
theres a crisis still out there said ted mondale midwest 
political director for dukakis 
sen thad cochran rmiss a bush agricultural adviser called 
the dukakis program a big mystery that is causing anxiety in farm 
country 
they seem to be in favor of massive cutbacks in production 
cochran charged 
the democratic nominee has not endorsed the stringent production 
controls that two farm state democrats sen tom harkin of iowa and 
rep richard gephardt of missouri have sought their bill died in 
the 100th congress 
mondale said dukakis supports the concept but not the 
particulars of the harkingephardt legislation 
dukakis in his position paper on agriculture said us farm 
policy must include a combination of supply management and 
reasonable price supports in a way that makes it possible for family 
farmers to earn a decent living from the land 
while bush often refers derisively to dukakis supply 
management ideas the 1985 farm bill that bush lavishly praises 
also gave the government supply management powers and mondale said 
the reagan administrations price supports and setasides were all 
supply management tools 
bush has said the bipartisan 1985 farm law is just beginning to 
pay off for farmers it has led to lower commodity prices which 
coupled with the drop in the dollars value helped boost farm 
exports 18 percent last year he says and he boasts that net cash 
farm income last year was a record 57 billion 
rural america has been strongly tested in recent years 
however i believe we have seen the bottom and are headed back up 
says bush 
the vice president says he would press ahead with efforts to 
phase out over a reasonable period those subsidies that distort 
agricultural trade if and only if other countries do the same 
but he promises to preserve a true safety net to ensure the 
viability of the family farm and rural america 
dukakis says farmers and ranchers are being squeezed at both 
ends facing lower commodity prices and a shrinking share of each 
food dollar down from 32 percent in 1976 to 25 percent now 
still lower prices are not the answer the democrat argues 
our present policy seems to be guided by a desire to drive 
commodity prices lower and lower in the hope of some future recovery 
of lost markets 
dukakis promises to target farm program benefits to family 
farmers who need them most 
dukakis hopes to narrow the federal deficit by reducing farm 
subsidies in his last debate with bush the massachusetts governor 
said he was sure a dukakis administration could give our farm 
families a decent income without spending 20to25 billion a year 
in farm subsidies 
farm subsidies shot up from 5 billion in 1980 under the carter 
administration to 25 billion in 1986 under reagan this year the 
administration and congress came up with nearly 4 billion in 
emergency drought aid 
but the droughtfed higher crop prices also reduce the need for 
government price supports 
mondale son of the former vice president said ruefully that 
bush was claiming credit for higher prices and exports that really 
belong to the weather and the democrats farm state legislators 
most of them democrats had to shove the export enhancement 
program down the reagan administrations throat he said 
bush constantly reminds rural audiences of the carter 
administrations 1979 grain embargo against the soviet union and 
implies that dukakis is liable to try another bush promises he 
wont use farmers and ranchers and their families as foreign 
policy pawns 
but dukakis says in no instance would i impose an embargo 
dukakis says the productivity of us farmers should be viewed 
as a blessing not a curse surplus farm commodities should be 
better used to feed hungry people both at home and abroad he 
favors barter with countries that want our farm goods but dont 
have the needed currency 
bush has promised to devote an economic summit meeting with the 
major us allies to the subject of agriculture 
both candidates support wider use of ethanol the alternative 
fuel made from gasoline and alcohol 
dukakis has also promised help for ailing rural hospitals and 
other steps to revitalize rural communities 
bush suggests rural enterprise zones to help distressed 
communities 
whether rural america perceives its own glass as halffull or 
halfempty may decide which candidate wins the farm state vote 
theres a lot of optimism in agriculture today compared with 
several years ago when huge surpluses were hanging over the 
market said cochran with inflation under control and interest 
rates at least stable farmers are feeling they may be able to 
work their way clear of some indebtedness 
mondale said the key to this election is whether we can get 
mike dukakis ag program out so that people on main street 
understand it and see that its a reasonable one

its been a down and dirty presidential 
campaign from gleeful democratic denunciations of george bush in 
atlanta as a wimp to the republicans skewering of michael dukakis 
over crime the aclu and his veto of a mandatory pledge of 
allegiance bill 
while the dismal tenor of this years campaign discourse has 
elicited groans from past presidents richard nixon and jimmy carter 
political analysts credit bush with tapping some of the same 
emotional issues that helped nixon capture the white house in 1968 
and 1972 and laid the groundwork for ronald reagans twin landslides 
of the 1980s 
and some experts say it is a serious mistake for the democrats 
who lost four of the past five presidential elections to 
underestimate the seriousness with which the electorate responds to 
emotional appeals to its patriotism or fear of crime 
the gut issues symbolic or not are real issues for many voters 
politics is a matter of gut responses otherwise known as 
emotions said roger d masters a dartmouth university professor 
of government 
its not just media manipulation said michael robinson a 
georgetown university associate professor of government and expert 
on media and politics if the democrats continue to believe that 
symbolic issues dont matter theyre going to foul up time and time 
again 
stephen hess a senior fellow at the brookings institution said 
the symbolic issues loom larger in this election because american 
politics like nature abhors a vacuum the candidates seemed quite 
deliberately to choose not to face up to the pragmatic issues 
robinson said the race unfolded in a time of economic prosperity 
when there were really few differences between the democrats and 
republicans on dealing with the soviet union 
when you subtract the issues of peace and prosperity you leave 
very little so we are left to fight on those gut issues he said 
analyst kevin phillips publisher of the american political 
report said the republicans have replayed the key cultural and 
patriotic issues with the swing voters that got the republican 
presidential majority started in 1968 and 1972 and 1980 
by flogging the crime spree of willie horton the massachusetts 
lifer who escaped while on a weekend furlough from prison and 
pummeling dukakis for being a selfproclaimed cardcarrying member 
of the american civil liberties union the bush campaign succeeded 
in rekindling in the minds of wavering reagan democrats the emotions 
that pulled them to vote for republican presidents in earlier 
years said phillips 
in their final debate oct 13 both candidates sounded apologetic 
about the lowroad campaigning bush recalling the almost nonstop 
attacks the democrats unleashed on him at their july convention in 
atlanta said i dont want to sound like a kid in the schoolyard 
but he started it 
it was both ways said ben wattenberg an american enterprise 
institute senior fellow two months ago the best issue that 
dukakis had on bush was wimp and the best issue bush had on 
dukakis was lword liberal 
the republicans went after dukakis on all the lword stuff 
which they had some nice symbols for prison furloughs and pledge 
of allegiance and aclu and stuff like that but it wasnt about 
those issues said wattenberg the reason they played was 
because they resonated in terms of 20 years of democratic party 
history as too liberal 
its not a small issue it is haunting this party said 
wattenberg a democrat it is which direction the plurality party 
in america wants to take the country 
on the other hand the democrats wimp charge quickly lost its 
punch as bush emerged from the gop convention in new orleans as 
captain marvel said wattenberg 
phillips said by going hardline on the cultural and patriotic 
issues bush drove down the wimp factor bush put on a bit of a 
john wayne outfit 
he added that the democrats failed to develop rival issues to 
appeal to the same swing voters bushs highest negative rating in 
polls remains the perception that he is too close to the rich and 
too far from the middle class 
but dukakis has been unable to come on hard and tough and use 
economic populism and nationalism to get the guys in the bar in the 
ethnic sections of cleveland or your dirt farmer in rural alabama 
angry at the republicans said phillips 
robinson said in a time of real prosperity questions of 
economic justice and hostility toward big business do not cut it 
with the american public 
you cant pretend that something that is an issue is not an 
issue it hurts the democrats when they try to dismiss this in some 
way as bigotry or tasteless or unamerican said robinson 
it is an issue to americans whether you wear your flag on your 
sleeve or whether you wear it on the seat of your pants republicans 
are not only willing to wear their flag on their sleeves theyre 
willing to wear it on their foreheads the democrats are willing to 
move it off their keister but they still want to keep it half 
covered and americans dont like that said the georgetown 
professor 
hess invoked a memory of a childhood pastime to explain why 
emotional issues have been so prominent in this race 
you could compare the whole of american campaigns to the 
childrens game of rock paper and scissors he said rocks are 
always the politicsaintbeanbag issues the tough gut hard 
campaign thats always there in american politics 
but its covered when there are particularly attractive 
candidates candidates that catch the imagination are 
papercoveringrock when you have overarching issues war or 
peace prosperity or recession thats scissors that cuts paper 
he explained 
here weve got a campaign in which there are no overarching 
issues so take away scissors there are no attractive candidates 
so take away paper 
what are you left with rock

when it comes to allimportant pocketbook 
issues george bush and michael dukakis seem to be describing 
different countries 
bushs america is one whose citizens enjoy unprecedented 
prosperity with 178 million new jobs created over the past six 
years 
good jobs at good wages the republican says swiping 
dukakis own tag line 
dukakis however describes a far different america where wages 
are stagnating and the rich have gotten richer the poor have 
gotten poorer and those in the middle and that means most of us 
are getting squeezed 
the basic argument is over whether highpaying factory jobs are 
being replaced by lowpaying jobs in the service sector reagan 
critics contend that too many of those 178 million new jobs involve 
flipping hamburgers or other lowpaid work 
in a 1986 study done for congress liberal economists barry 
bluestone and bennett harrison argued that america may be on the 
verge of losing its middle class 
the two professors reached the startling conclusion that nearly 
threefifths of the jobs created during the reagan years paid less 
than 7000 by contrast such lowwage jobs represented just 
onefifth of new jobs during the prereagan 196379 period the 
authors said 
new lowerpaid service jobs just wont support a family for 
every new job in silicon valley or wall street with high pay and 
perks there are many more jobs in the shopping mall that dont 
pay much more than minimum wage bluestone and bennett write in a 
new book the great uturn 
a study in september by the democraticcontrolled senate budget 
committee reached a similar conclusion 
the dominant trend in american job creation during the 1980s 
has been for lowpaying jobs to replace those which provided a 
middleclass standard of living the report said only 38 
percent of the increase in employment since 1979 was in 
middlewage jobs 
republicans counter that the democrats studies slant their 
results by counting not only fulltime jobs but also parttime 
employment lowering average pay 
when parttime jobs are excluded the statistics show the bulk of 
job growth has been in the middle say the republicans 
they point to a recent study by two bureau of labor statistics 
economists who concluded the middle defined as earnings between 
20000 and 60000 is indeed shrinking but that virtually all of 
the families leaving it have moved up not down 
the republicans brag that by almost all measures the reagan 
record looks better than the jimmy carter years when rapid 
inflation eroded earnings the bush campaign says median family 
incomes after adjusting for inflation have risen 10 percent during 
the reagan years after falling 7 percent from 1977 to 1981 
but dukakis calls it a twopaycheck prosperity income is up 
only because of a dramatic increase in the number of wives forced to 
work as cashstrapped families struggle to maintain their standard 
of living he argues 
all across america we see two parents working harder and 
harder to buy what one income could buy before the massachusetts 
governor says 
and even with more family members working the median family 
income last year of 30853 merely got americans back to where they 
were in 1973 
economists cite several factors for this development 
first the country absorbed large numbers of new workers entering 
the labor force in the 1970s as the baby boom generation reached 
maturity young inexperienced workers were a drag on productivity 
and competed with each other for jobs holding down wages 
from 1949 to 1973 nonfarm productivity rose 25 percent a year 
since rising productivity provides the room for wages to grow 
without fueling inflation median family incomes roughly doubled 
by contrast productivity growth from 1974 through 1980 averaged 
a mediocre 04 percent a year 
in addition salaries in the late 1970s were jolted by 
doubledigit inflation caused by oilprice increases then in the 
mid1980s workers in american industries lost ground to stiff 
foreign competition as the soaring value of the dollar opened the 
country to a flood of imports and priced american products out of 
overseas markets 
many economists see signs that these unfavorable trends are being 
reversed they predict better wage gains in the 1990s regardless of 
who wins the white house 
productivity in the 1980s has been rising 14 percent a year and 
the labor department estimates the labor force will grow in the 
1990s at less than half the pace of the peak years of the 1970s when 
baby boomers flooded the job market 
this will mean a return to the labor scarcity that helped boost 
wages in the 1950s 
the drop in oil prices has helped hold inflation down and a 
weaker dollar has helped revive us manufacturers 
but rosy predictions for the future havent tempered the debate 
over the past eight years 
the democrats note that despite the longest peacetime economic 
recovery on record 135 percent of americans were living in poverty 
last year compared with 117 percent in the carter year of 1979 
they point to census bureau statistics showing that the share of 
total income going to the richest fifth of american families 
increased to 437 percent in 1987 compared to 416 percent in 1980 
the share of income going to the poorest fifth fell to 46 percent 
in 1987 compared to 51 percent in 1980 
but with the economy growing since 1984 and unemployment hovering 
near 14year lows republicans say the pocketbook issues voters care

republican george bush is running for president 
on his extensive foreign policy credentials and on the strength of 
the reagan administrations triumph in signing a nuclear arms treaty 
with the soviet union 
democratic nominee michael dukakis who cannot match his rivals 
experience instead attacks bushs judgment and challenges the 
administrations right to claim any credit for the soviet withdrawal 
from afghanistan or the end of the iraniraq war 
dukakis supports the negotiated ban on mediumrange nuclear 
missiles and endorses the goal of a 50 percent reduction in 
longrange missiles in ussoviet talks at geneva but he 
attributes the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty to soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs recognition of his countrys economic 
failures not to president reagans military buildup and gettough 
stance toward the soviets 
both presidential candidates would be certain to press ahead with 
arms control talks and try to build on the momentum achieved in the 
four reagangorbachev summits 
although dukakis has accused the reagan administration of 
mishandling middle east policy and waiting until the twilight of its 
term to seek a breakthrough there neither dukakis nor bush has 
spelled out any major initiatives to bring the arabs and israelis 
together 
both have assured israel of continued us support dukakis has 
endorsed shifting the us embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem a 
move that administration officials fear could undermine progress 
toward an arabisraeli settlement 
but in such troublespots as nicaragua and south africa dukakis 
is committed to changing the policies adopted by reagan and 
championed by bush 
bush supports renewed aid to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
dukakis calls reagans central american policies a fiasco and 
vehemently opposes contra aid favoring instead the diplomatic peace 
plan of costa rican president oscar arias 
on south africa dukakis promises to press for tougher 
international sanctions against the apartheid regime bush says 
further sanctions would only hurt black workers dukakis also 
opposes us aid for the south africanbacked rebels in angola 
while bush supports it 
the democratic nominee says the united states should work with 
its allies and through international organizations rather than go it 
alone he has said the nato allies and japan must bear a larger 
share of the common defense 
bush a former ambassador to the united nations says youve 
got to understand that it is only the united states that can stand 
for freedom and democracy around the world and we cant turn it 
over to the united nations or other multilateral organizations 
bush cites the inf treaty the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan 
and the tentative end of the iraniraq war as vindication of the 
administrations peace through strength philosophy 
for the vice president that means pressing ahead with 
development and eventual deployment of star wars or the strategic 
defense initiative which dukakis once ridiculed as a fantasy 
it also means pounding dukakis for opposing both the mobile mx 
and midgetman missiles the soviets are modernizing they continue 
to modernize and we cant simply say weve got enough nuclear 
weapons lets freeze bush said 
dukakis favored a nuclear freeze in the early 1980s when the 
reagan administration persuaded nervous allies in western europe to 
accept pershing ii and cruise missiles to counter the soviets own 
mediumrange weapons 
the governor has said the 13000 nuclear weapons in the us 
arsenal and the 9000 stockpiled by the soviets are enough to blow 
each country up 40 times over 
but dukakis supports the stealth or b2 bomber which rolls off 
the assembly line in late november and backs the new generation of 
nuclear missiles for the trident submarine 
bush has said his approach toward the soviet union would avoid 
swings between unjustified euphoria and exaggerated pessimism 
dukakis speaks of trying to drive the agenda with the soviet 
union instead of following gorbachevs lead 
bush has visited 74 foreign countries as vice president he was 
envoy to china and director of central intelligence as well as 
ambassador to the united nations 
i dont think we should risk turning over the leadership and 
security of this free world of ours to a man with literally no 
experience in foreign affairs bush recently told voters in south 
river nj 
its not the length of your resume counters dukakis its 
your strength its your values the quality of the people you pick 
its your understanding of the forces of change in a sweeping new 
world 
dukakis has questioned bushs judgment in not trying to block the 
armsforhostages deal with iran he says bush must share the blame 
for dealing with panamanas military leader manuel noriega now 
under indictment for alleged involvement in drug trafficking he 
criticized bush for once toasting thenphilippine president 
ferdinand marcos for your adherence to democratic principles 
dukakis supports a mutual ban on testing and deployment of 
antisatellite weapons and a prohibition of all underground nuclear 
tests 
bush supports the administrations controversial broad 
interpretation of the antiballistic missile or abm treaty a move 
intended to leave room for testing star wars dukakis favors the 
original narrow interpretation 
bush says he wants the world to adopt and enforce a total ban on 
chemical and biological weapons dukakis scoffs at that saying that 
bush cast tiebreaking senate votes in favor of resuming production 
of chemical weapons 
bush has accused dukakis of opposing the us invasion of grenada 
in 1983 and the 1986 strike against libya the democrat denies the 
charge 
dukakis hedged his support on both occasions he said the grenada 
invasion was justified if the lives of american students were at 
stake and the libyan raid was proper if its aim was to hit 
terrorist bases and not to assassinate libyan leader moammar gadhafi

if the federal budget deficit seems invisible 
to most americans the gaping trade deficit is all too apparent 
they see its evidence every day in the cars they drive the 
televisions they watch the shoes they wear 
now it will fall to either george bush or michael dukakis to try 
to remedy this other us deficit the trade imbalances that hit a 
staggering 170 billion last year and are running at a 138 billion 
pace for 1988 
the american appetite for imported goods became voracious in the 
1980s as a strong dollar produced a flood of bargains for us 
consumers even when the dollar took a nosedive after intervention 
by the united states and its allies in 1985 americans retained 
their taste for imports 
japanese automakers who established a beachhead in the us 
market with cheap fuelefficient subcompacts earned a larger and 
more expensive niche on the strength of their autos quality and 
reliability 
the trade law signed by president reagan in august gives the next 
president new tools to protect american markets and retaliate 
against countries with unfair trading practices 
dukakis running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas was the 
leading congressional champion of the tougher trade law 
i want to be a president who stands up and fights for american 
companies american products and american workers dukakis said at 
a metal factory in dayton ohio last month 
bush says american exports are booming the trade deficit is 
already coming down and free trade not protectionism is the way 
to restore americas competitiveness the republican dismisses 
dukakis warnings about foreign ownership as protectionist 
demagoguery 
we need to increase our exports not shut our borders says 
bush but he adds our commitment to free trade must be linked to 
a reciprocal commitment to fair trade by our trading partners 
dukakis while trying to make a gutlevel appeal to american 
workers alarmed about their livelihood has tried to avoid being 
cast as a protectionist 
dukakis stayed conspicuously silent when congress passed a 
protectionist textile bill in september that reagan vetoed 
but even reagan is not the doctrinaire freetrader he once was 
his administration confronted with gaping trade deficits backed 
off from what had been an undeviating faith in free markets in 1985 
and worked in concert with allies to bring the value of the dollar 
down that effort was orchestrated by james baker iii thentreasury 
secretary and now bush campaign chairman 
theres been very vigorous enforcement of trade laws under the 
reaganbush administration in the past three years said bruce 
smart a bush trade adviser and former undersecretary of commerce 
dukakis says the reaganbush policies in those first four years 
turned two generations of trade surpluses into the worlds largest 
trade deficit and cost our workers 5 million jobs 
but smart notes both bush and dukakis support the uscanada 
free trade agreement and favor strengthening the 96nation general 
agreement on tariffs and trade gatt which sets global trading 
rules and investigates alleged violations 
dukakis has endorsed extending voluntary restraint agreements 
with 29 steelexporting countries after those agreements expire next 
sept 30 bush has withheld judgment waiting to see if there is a 
better way to help us steel companies at a disadvantage from 
subsidized imports smart said 
both bush and dukakis supported the unfair trade complaint that 
american rice growers lodged against japan 
us trade representative clayton k yeutter rejected that 
complaint last friday prompting the dukakis campaign to accuse the 
administration of failing to stand up for america 
economist david wyss said its quite clear bush would continue 
current policies sticking as much as possible with multilateral 
accords and keeping an open economy dukakis feels that 
interference with trade is justifiable to protect american 
industry 
there is no easy way out said robert strauss who was trade 
negotiator for the carter administration 
its going to take strong direction from the president leading 
the way with the bully pulpit said strauss you must do a lot 
of things including strike some global bargains with the europeans 
and japanese 
william beeman a vice president of the committee for economic 
development a business group said the most important thing you 
can do for the trade deficit is reduce the budget deficit 
foreign investors lured by high interest rates bought up much of 
the treasury debt that financed the reagan budget deficits that in 
turn helped drive up the dollars value and made it harder for us 
manufacturers to compete abroad 
bush looks to farm exports to help restore the trade balance and 
promises to make agriculture a prime topic at the next economic 
summit with us allies 
dukakis has pledged to wipe out the trade deficit in four years 
without fully spelling out how the most important step is to reduce 
the federal deficit he says 
both candidates agree better education is a key to improving us 
productivity and competitiveness 
dukakis says he would insist on reciprocity from such us 
trading partners as japan south korea west germany and brazil that 
restrict american imports while they flood the us with 
products 
but in an earlier position paper the democrat also cautioned 
against erecting trade barriers saying if every barrier to 
american goods abroad disappeared tomorrow we would still have a 
trade deficit of 125 billion 
wyss chief economist of data resources inc of lexington mass 
said the new trade law is a potential disaster in the wrong 
hands 
its really a protectionist measure but it gives the president 
a great deal of leeway to shortcircuit that wyss said 
the first sign of the next administrations intentions may come 
next april when the law requires the us trade representative to 
produce a list of targeted countries along with a plan for 
negotiations to remove trade barriers

george bush says he is almost haunted by 
the plight of innercity children michael dukakis speaks of the 
torment of parents who cannot afford health insurance for their 
children 
both candidates agree that far too many children are growing up 
poor and both promise to do something about it 
skeptics say that for all their visits to day care centers 
republican bush and democrat dukakis have never spelled out how they 
would attack the child care problem 
but others are heartened that the candidates are talking about 
child care infant mortality and high school dropouts and are 
confident that the next president and a new congress will give 
higher priority to easing the plight of millions of american 
children 
nearly 13 million children 1 in every 5 are growing up in 
poverty according to the census bureau 
after dramatic progress in the 1960s the child poverty rate 
soared from 138 percent in 1969 to 222 percent in the recession 
year of 1983 it has leveled off at slightly more than 20 percent in 
recent years 
medicaid the federalstate insurance plan for the poor covers 
only half of these children 
forty thousand american infants die before their first birthday 
and progress has slowed in reducing the infant mortality rate the 
united states which had the sixth lowest rate in the world in 1955 
now ranks 19th 
the only reason we havent seen action on these issues is that 
children dont vote for too long in the political process children 
have been seen but not heard says robert sweeney president of 
the national association of childrens hospitals 
education statistics are equally bleak 
head start the 12 billion preschool program for the 
disadvantaged reaches fewer than 20 percent of its target group 
chapter one the 46 billion remedial effort to help youngsters 
falling behind in school work reaches barely half 
more than 26 percent of teenagers leave high school without a 
diploma drugs gangs crime and homelessness all make the poverty 
trap even deeper 
i find myself almost haunted by the lives being lived by the 
children of our inner cities bush said recently 
his response is a 37 billion invest in our children 
initiative which includes a 1000perchild tax credit to 
lowincome working families with children under age 4 as well as 
expanded head start and medicaid coverage 
dukakis makes an even bigger promise making basic health care a 
birthright for all americans primarily by requiring employers to 
provide basic health insurance coverage for workers and their 
families 
marian wright edelman president of the childrens defense fund 
said i welcome the fact that they oth recognize that youvegot to 
deal with enormous gaps in preventive health services for mothers 
and babies the question now is translating that into money and 
actual programs 
edelman was disappointed at congress failure this year to pass 
the 25 billion a better child child care bill that dukakis and 
many democrats favored the abc bill would have set minimum 
standards and funneled grants to states to help low and 
middleincome families with child care 
dukakis backed the abc concept but committed himself only to 
startup funds not the full 25 billion 
bush proposed a 22 billion alternative hinged on the 1000 
toddler tax credit for lowincome working families who would get 
the credit whether or not they actually paid for child care 
bush accused dukakis and the democrats of wanting to license 
grandmothers and impose burdensome federal regulations on child 
care 
thomas d herman deputy national issues director for the dukakis 
campaign said bushs proposal does nothing to create new child 
care slots it doesnt even go halfway toward paying for the 
child care thats needed 
dukakis says his plan to require employerpaid basic health 
insurance for workers would cover almost twothirds of the 37 
million american children and adults who lack insurance 
for those still uncovered dukakis proposes a 100 million 
prenatal and nutritional program for 200000 pregnant women in 
families up to 200 percent of the poverty line 
bush oposes mandatory health insurance on the job but he 
supports requiring all states to provide medicaid coverage for all 
children in families with incomes below the poverty line 
bush supports phasing in affordable coverage for pregnant 
women and infants up to 185 percent of the poverty level he has 
suggested slidingscale premiums and allowing people to buy into 
medicaid a concept he has not explained fully 
most states already cover poor infants and under existing law 
all must cover pregnant women and infants up to 100 percent o the 
poverty level starting july 1 1990 
rep henry waxman dcalif said bushs numbers dont add up 
its not enough to talk about being a kinder and gentler nation you 
also have to pay for it 
but deborah steelman bushs domestic issues adviser said the 
vice president has not promised more than he can deliver 
with head start a program that serves 454000 prekindergarten 
children ages 3 to 5 the vice president promises to expand it so it 
is big enough to reach all eligible 4yearolds but not all the 
other preschoolers 
steelman said age 4 is the critical year when they are most 
likely to absorb true developmental skills 
we are targeted to get results these are not just blanket 
covereverybody proposals steelman said she estimates that 
bushs plan would add 1 billion and 350000 children to the head 
start budget over four years

when i looked at the average amount that utilities were 
spending from 1978 to 1984 and then i looked at what tva was 
spending we were underspending everyone else he said 
that meant we were either a lot more efficient and i didnt 
see any signs of that or we were underfunded i think we were 
underfunded 
as white prepares to leave tva saying he wants to devote more 
time to his family in virginia sequoyah unit 2 is back on line 
unit 1 is on the verge of returning to operation and browns ferry 
unit 2 is scheduled to be producing power again next spring 
but none of this was accomplished without controversy first 
there was his 355200 annual salary paid under a personal services 
contract that allowed tva to bypass the federal employee salary cap 
then 72300 a year it costs money to get good nuclear talent 
white has said commenting on his pay and that of contractors hes 
hired 
still unresolved is his statement to the nrc in march 1986 that 
tvas unlicensed watts bar nuclear plant near spring city tenn 
had no major safety problems 
that was not the case and the nrc recently concluded that white 
lied although the agency decided against any fine tva has said it 
still believes white did not mean to mislead the nrc 
white insisting he did nothing wrong contends the charges were 
part of an orchestrated effort by tva opponents to discredit its 
nuclear power program 
the other major figure in tvas comeback effort has been runyon 
the former president of nissan motor manufacturing corp usa who was 
appointed tva chairman in january after 44 years in the auto 
business 
he took one look at the utilitys rising rates and promptly 
launched a huge reorganization designed to keep them steady for at 
least three years 
included was the muchcriticized layoff of 7400 of tvas 34000 
employees but runyon said the cheaper electricity would ultimately 
lure more jobs to the tennessee valley 
our mission is still to improve the quality of life in the 
valley said runyon but to do that today what we have to do is 
supply power at a competitive rate 
tvas layers of management which had ballooned to 12 in some 
departments were slashed to six creating more streamlined 
communication between employees and bosses 
runyon also launched a program of bonuses for managers like 
whites successor oliver d kingsley jr in an effort to hire and 
keep nuclear experts who otherwise might go to betterpaying private 
utilities 
can tva turn itself around observers arent sure 
runyon has a very difficult job said mark siegel director 
of an often critical watchdog group the tennessee valley coalition 
he has done some things that are praiseworthy in trying to cut 
back on duplication and waste 
but theres still no clear idea how tva will pay off its huge 
debt much of it in plant writeoffs that have not yet been passed 
along to the ratepayers 
there are also concerns that runyons interest in stable electric 
rates may come at the expense of conservation and antipollution 
efforts siegel said 
white meanwhile says tva should be careful not to repeat the 
pinchpenny mistakes that he blames for the nuclear problems 
you cant just talk money and income without talking about 
safety and reliability white said 
runyon insists the federal agency can adopt efficient operating 
methods from private utilities as it seeks to recover its prestige 
and financial health 
business is a good word he said i think too often well 
people say its going to run like a business and they put that 
down like its not nice but business is what made the united states 
what it is today

at the starrett city housing complex in brooklyn 
skin color determines how long you must wait to move in and where 
you live once you do if youre white you wait months if youre 
black you wait years 
so why has jesse jackson called it the embodiment of we are the 
world why are its policies endorsed by the state naacp why does 
kenneth clark whose research helped discredit the doctrine of 
separate but equal say it would be tragic if starrett city were 
forced to change its ways 
it is because the complex one parkway exit from the white 
enclave of howard beach and a few hundred feet from the black and 
hispanic projects of east new york has used racial discrimination 
to achieve racial integration 
it does it with quotas starrett citys population is about 55 
percent white a quarter black 10 percent hispanic and 5 percent 
asian a mix that is roughly duplicated on each floor of each 
building 
the result is an urban rarity a thoroughly integrated 
community from its two schools and community center down to kids 
saturday afternoon football games the bakery even sells wedding 
cakes topped with mixedrace bride and groom statuettes 
but starrett citys days as a racial paradise appear numbered 
federal courts have ruled that whatever their intent its racial 
quotas violate the fair housing acts ban on racial discrimination 
starretts appeal is now before the us supreme court 
the case is being watched closely because the government has 
filed similar suits in chicago and charlottesville va and is 
conducting investigations in other communities 
quotas are common in public and private housing complexes around 
the nation according to robert rosenberg starretts general 
manager and a former city housing official mostly its done 
surreptitiously no one talks about it the only difference is we 
didnt sneak around we admitted we were doing it because we 
believe its not illegal 
with 46 apartment towers and more than 20000 residents starrett 
city is the largest federally subsidized housing development in 
america but when the middleincome complex was ready for occupancy 
12 years ago black and hispanic applicants far outnumbered whites 
it was apparent to rosenberg that he would soon have a segregated 
community 
so rosenberg a jew who was brought up to hate quotas adopted 
them as what he calls the lesser of two evils today whites 
still account for only about 20 percent of starrett citys 
applicants accordingly blacks wait several years for an apartment 
whites for a few months 
if the quotas were replaced by a system of firstcome 
firstserved the percentage of white residents would eventually 
drop to 20 percent at the very least in reality rosenberg argues 
virtually all whites would flee around the time they cease to 
comprise a majority the phenomenon known as tipping 
to prove its point in court the complex has presented studies by 
clark a black sociologist who also was cited by the supreme court 
in its 1954 school desegregation decision in brown vs the board of 
education 
in a racist society there is no other way to bring about 
stable integration but to recognize that fact of racism and to deal 
with it argues rosenberg 
but william bradford reynolds head of the justice departments 
civil rights division says the end does not justify the means 
what youre doing is excluding people and including them by reason 
of skin color 
reynolds has been accused of using the starrett case to try to 
justify his opposition to affirmative action quotas designed to help 
minorities in a dissent to the order upholding the original federal 
court decision federal appellate judge jon newman wrote that the 
suit raises substantial questions as to the governments 
commitment to integrated housing 
starrett citys residents take a less academic view they like 
what theyve got and they want to keep it 
this is integration and everyone knows it says joyce 
peeples an hispanic whose husband is black i dont feel like a 
minority i feel like im part of this community 
we dont like to use the word quota says rabbi avner 
german but for the next 100 years or whatever if youre going to 
have integration you have to have quotas 
starrett citys stability makes it particularly attractive in a 
city whose recent history has been marked by rapid sometimes 
violent changes in the racial composition of many neighborhoods 
jimmy opharrow who is black moved to starrett after the public 
housing project where he was living began to deteriorate it was an 
old story as more blacks moved in whites began moving out 
followed by more affluent blacks services seemed to suffer he 
worries the same could happen again 
ruth horowitz moved to starrett city from neighboring east new 
york which in the 1960s was the scene of blockbusting by 
unscrupulous real estate agents she recalls receiving dozens of 
post cards warning that the neighborhood was changing and urging her 
to sell her home while she could 
now she lives on a floor with an israeli family a black 
family a white couple a black couple with children an old jewish 
man two italian sisters and a family of immigrants from eastern 
europe 
although surveys indicate that black residents are about equally 
divided on quotas a black community group opposes the governments 
suit as do many black elected officials 
reynolds admits the starrett issue is a tough call but 
points out that the quota system creates victims minority group 
members stuck on a waiting list in a city with a critical housing 
shortage 
blacks relegation to the back of the waiting line has evoked 
comparisons to their place on the bus years ago 
karene freeman a housing rights attorney recalls a black woman 
crying in her office because her family was languishing on the 
waiting list while whites who had applied after she did got in 
if the only way to achieve integration is to discriminate 
against blacks theres something wrong says phyllis spiro of the 
open housing center 
but many starrett residents claim the very process of admitting 
more minority applicants will destroy the community they hope to 
join 
if there is tipping the very people who want to get in 
wouldnt want to live here says ms horowitz what weve got is 
what were looking for 
rosenberg says management will try to keep up the complex 
regardless of who moves in but he says without quotas something 
will be lost a model of integrated governmentsubsidized housing 
that disproves the notion voiced mostly recently in nearby yonkers 
that assisted housing must inevitably become segregated housing 
meanwhile starrett residents wait anxiously the impending 
change is a topic of conversation says ms horowitz some of 
the older people are frightened 
but a jewish community center is under construction were 
betting on starrett city remaining integrated says rabbi german 
what if starrett city does become segregated 
we have singlerace neighborhoods reynolds has said 
nothing wrong with that so long as it doesnt come about by 
discriminatory means if puerto ricans want to live with puerto 
ricans thats their right 
rosenberg is more cynical in three years well be segregated 
and then theyll be suing us for that

the head of the federal aviation administration

techniques of communicating with each other 
faa administrator allan mcartor said tuesday his agency was 
issuing a 44page booklet with common sense tips and holding 
seminars on effective communications between controllers and pilots

communications use of improper phraseology improper voice 
inflection poor listening habits and a failure of pilots to read 
back clearances given by controllers

a drop 01 percent drop in the governments chief economic 
forecasting gauge indicates continued slow growth in the economy 
but economists say they do not expect a recession anytime soon 
the commerce departments report tuesday on its leading economic 
indicators helped pressure the dollar lower but seemed to have 
little effect on the stock market 
the dollar weakened tuesday despite concerted dollar purchases by 
the central banks of the united states and japan and that helped 
push bonds down slightly 
stocks were little changed tuesday the dow jones average of 30 
industrials rose 231 points to 215096 while declining issues 
outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 on the new york stock exchange 
in other reports tuesday the commerce department said 
construction spending rose 06 percent in september to an annual 
rate of 4034 billion as strength in housing and government 
construction offset a decline in office building 
construction spending for the first nine months of the year is 
07 percent higher than a year ago a sluggish performance that 
analysts expect will continue because of widespread overbuilding of 
offices and other commercial space 
the drop in the leading indicators was the third in the past five 
months 
there is absolutely no question that the economy is slowing 
down said lawrence chimerine chief economist of the wefa group 
an economic consulting firm the only question is whether this 
slowdown will lead into a recession 
chimerine said he believed a recession can be avoided over the 
next 12 months to 18 months although he said this forecast could 
prove too optimistic if consumer spending slows more than expected 
or if the dollar comes under further pressure from foreigners 
worried about the ability of the next administration to deal with 
budget and trade deficits 
the recovery from the 198182 recession completes a peacetime 
record of six years this month and the reagan administration is 
hoping this performance will persuade voters to keep the white house 
in republican hands

the december contract for wholesale heating oil was up 042 cent 
a gallon to settle at 4317 cents tuesday on the new york mercantile

us crude settled at 1344 a barrel down 14 cents the contract 
was off 27 cents in the previous session 
john oconnell a senior energy analyst for refco inc said 
increased seasonal demand and technical factors largely were 
responsible for tuesdays rise in home heating oil prices but he 
said continued worries about overproduction among opec members 
particularly giant producer saudi arabia kept other prices down 
oconnell said trading was thin as most dealers were reluctant to 
take any major positions until the cartel held its scheduled meeting 
later this month

in vienna on nov 17 to discuss tightening production to boost

effect immediately was up from a rate of 690 percent earned in the 
last six months it is the highest rate since savings bonds earned 
836 percent from november 1985 through may 1986

chinese officials are taking pains to assure 
foreign businesses that their contracts will be honored despite 
plans to slash domestic spending and shut down hundreds of domestic 
companies 
chinas handling of its latest austerity drive the third since 
it opened to foreign trade and investment in 1978 shows a new 
awareness of the need to temper the effect of policy swings and 
avoid frightening away foreign investors considered key to 
development 
premier li peng vice premier tian jiyun trade minister zheng 
tuobin and the bank of china all have promised in recent weeks that 
chinas 9700 foreign joint ventures will be exempt from austerity 
measures intended to stem a 20percent inflation 
all signed contracts for ordering goods and joint ventures will 
be implemented li told about 200 visiting chief executive 
officers of american companies on oct 17 he repeated the same 
message later in the week to a japanese banking delegation 
the bank of china the chief chinese lender to joint ventures 
said it will continue doing so 
one of chinas leading investment and trade companies the kang 
hua development corp which has been stripped of trade rights and 
ordered to divest many subsidiaries as punishment for illegal 
operations promised it will carry out all contracts already signed 
with foreign companies 
kang hua has signed about 4000 import and export contracts worth 
a total of 670 million since being founded 17 months ago 
the assurances seem to be having their desired effect foreign 
businessmen and diplomats in beijing said they expect a drop in 
chinese import orders but not a significant reduction in joint 
venture activity most seemed confident the impact would be minimal 
one predicted delays in signing new contracts however as the 
central government scrutinizes local projects more closely to weed 
out any not deemed essential 
chinese officials say consumption and industrial growth must be 
slowed and beijing must reassert central control over the economy to 
restore order to a market in which excessive demand has generated 
inflation hoarding and black marketeering 
foreign companies that sell factory equipment raw materials and 
luxuries to china from cars to air conditioners can expect a drop 
in orders import taxes on a wide range of goods have been increased 
and calls have been issued for import substitution where possible 
however premier li told the chief executive officers that china 
remains interested in joint projects in energy transportation 
communications raw material production and hightechnology 
foreign companies that want to manufacture consumer appliances in 
china such as televisions and refrigerators are welcome only if 
their products are for export li said 
the government also has said the construction of hotels 
auditoriums and other public buildings will be sharply curtailed 
companies found guilty of illegal transactions such as buying and 
selling scarce goods on the black market will be closed and 
companies set up by government offices will be shut down or spun off 
specifics such as which projects will be halted and which 
chinese companies reorganized or closed have been slow to emerge 
and foreign businessmen said it was too early to predict the 
eventual impact there have been no reports of casualties in the 
form of canceled contract talks 
the government also ordered slowdowns in economic growth in 1980 
and 1985 when it ran short of foreign currency reserves needed for 
imports some joint ventures were halted in midstream or canceled 
as were many import orders 
at that time the chinese had no cash said a western 
diplomat now its different they have the cash theyre trying 
to pause and think

a bold effort to start a us company 
aimed at denting japans manufacturing dominance in computer memory 
devices has failed because american chip users would not help 
finance the venture according to the venture capitalist who 
originated the idea 
ive given up pierre lamond a general partner at sequoia 
capital and cofounder of national semiconductor corp said tuesday 
ive been working on it since may we gave ourselves a 
timetable and a limit and we could not get any sizable industrial 
partner to sign on the dotted line lamond said 
we had lot of promises a lot of interest but it was all talk 
no action 
lamonds plan for a partnership to finance a memory chip 
startup using 15 million cash from investors and 425 million in 
lease guarantees from us chip users was an attempt to wrest from 
japan some of the 57 billion worldwide market for drams dynamic 
random access memory chips 
those chips in short supply for about a year are critical 
components in desktop computers printers and dozens of other 
electronic goods 
some american computer companies have been forced to curtail 
production or raise prices because of the dram shortage and have 
complained that japanese chip users get preferential treatment from 
japanese chipmakers 
most us chipmakers have dropped out of the memory chip 
business largely because japanese companies in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s sold chips at belowmarket prices to grab market share 
only two us companies texas instruments inc in dallas and 
micron technology inc in boise idaho continue to make and sell 
drams in the united states 
although users of drams complain about the treatment theyre 
getting from the japanese theyre not willing to put their money 
where their mouth is said lamond i guess theyre satisfied 
with the japanese as suppliers 
lamond had approached four computer makers affected by the dram 
shortage apple computer inc of cupertino sun microsystems inc of 
mountain view compaq computer corp of houston and digital 
equipment corp of maynard mass 
if i could not convince four major forwardlooking companies i 
dont think i could convince other smaller companies lamond said 
apple and sun spokesmen said they had no immediate comment 
digital and compaq were closed late tuesday when contacted for 
comment 
the worldwide dram market is expected to grow from 57 billion 
this year to 105 billion by 1992 according to dataquest inc a 
san jose calif market research firm 
the japanese have 90 percent of the worldwide market for one 
megabit drams lamond said referring to the tiny chips that can 
hold 1 million bits of information theyre now assembling the 
next generation four megabit chips and are expected to go into 
production in 1990 and theyll probably grab 95 percent of that 
market 
its scary to be at the mercy of a single supplier he said 
they will be able to throttle help or injure any one of the 
users if they dont like a particular company they wont ship to 
it or more likely theyll say if you want drams you have to buy 
everything else from us 
the proposed company dubbed megaram by lamond would have 
employed about 1000 workers he said and attempted to reach 100 
million in sales by its third year 
lamond sought 15 million in venture capital for megarams 
initial working capital he wanted chip users to provide lease 
guarantees for 125 million in chipmaking plant and equipment during 
megarams first phase and 300 million over five years 
the chip users would have been liable for the leases only if 
megaram defaulted on its payment 
lamond said the lease guarantee arrangement was one way to avoid 
the high cost of capital which has been a problem for us 
technology companies competing with japanese firms 
in return for the lease guarantees the us companies would have 
a priority call on the memory chips which would be sold at 
market prices

directors of utah power amp light co and 
pacificorp have signaled their acceptance of federal conditions 
imposed on a proposed 2 billion merger of the utility holding 
companies although they do not necessarily like them a spokesman 
says 
directors unanimously reaffirmed their support for a proposed 
merger on tuesday and extended until dec 15 the previous oct 31 
deadline for either company to terminate the merger if not closed by 
the deadline 
the stock swap merger was approved in august 1987 by both 
companies and state regulators in seven states later concurred 
however the federal energy regulatory commission last week gave 
its approval on condition that the merged companys transmission 
lines were opened to competing utilities to ensure the merger would 
not be anticompetitive 
from this you can infer that the companies will accept the 
conditions the ferc said it will impose although we think that some 
of the conditions are unnecessary and harshspecifically 
transmission access utah power spokesman dave mead said 
officials of portlandbased pacificorp said that while not all 
the ferc conditions were believed to be justified they will not 
have a significant effect on the vast majority of merger benefits 
those include savings from administrative combinations work force 
reductions and meeting peak demand requirements more efficiently 
power supply benefits relating to more efficient use of 
generating resources between the two companies also remain intact 
under the conditions 
mead said the merger still was expected to gain utah customers a 
5 percent to 10 percent rate reduction over a fouryear period 
our best estimate is that the ferc transmission conditions will 
reduce wholesale power benefits by approximately 1 million annually 
for the first five years following the merger said dave bolender 
president of pacificorps pacific power amp light division 
the primary purpose of the merger is to strengthen our ability 
to offer an attractive competitively priced array of energy 
services to our retail customers in an increasingly competitive 
marketplace he said the ferc order will not detract from our 
ability to compete in that changed marketplace 
utahs public service commission issued an order suspending its 
approval of the merger and scheduled a nov 8 hearing on the effect 
of the fercs order mead said upampl would present its analysis of 
the conditions affecting the merger at that time and were optimistic 
about regaining the pscs approval 
the merged utility would become one of the largest utilities in 
the west serving more than 1 million customers in a sevenstate 
service area that also includes oregon california washington 
idaho montana and wyoming 
the ferc expressed concern the merger would stifle competition in 
the western states wholesale power market with a single utility 
owning strategic transmission stretching from the northwest to the 
southwest 
from the onset both utilities said that integrating their 
transmission systems would provide huge benefits and profits as they 
used the merged system to sell excess capacity to lucrative markets 
in the southwest and wheel power between divisions to stabilize 
seasonal periods of low and high demand 
but fercs approval requires the merged company to open its 
transmission to competing utilities and meet all bona fide 
requests for service either by using its existing capacity or by 
building new facilities

only one utility defendant remains in the 
securities fraud trial stemming from the washington public power 
supply systems record 225 billion municipal bond default 
district judge william browning signed an order tuesday dropping 
14 washington state utilities from the trial 
as the trial reconvened today browning told the jurors that 14 
utilities had settled but instructed them not to infer anything from 
the settlement 
you should not consider it the judge instructed you 
should not draw any inference of any party 
brownings order came hours after the us department of justice 
in washington dc approved the federal governments share of a 
226 million settlement between the utilities and purchasers of 
municipal bonds used to build two wppss nuclear power plants that 
were abandoned before completion 
browning still must approve the settlement a hearing on that 
matter is to be scheduled 
the settlement leaves snohomish county public utility district as 
the sole utility defendant in the trial 
snohomish has until nov 10 to join in the settlement by 
approving a 486 million offer said mel weiss an attorney for the 
plaintiff bond purchasers 
the trial will now take on a new complexion with the other 
utilities gone he said 
the plaintiffs will have to focus on the three other remaining 
defendants ebasco services inc and united engineers amp contractors 
inc two engineering companies that built the unfinished plants 
and blyth eastman paine webber inc a wppss financial adviser 
the professional parties havent been our main focus up to 
now weiss said there will be a greater concentration of effort 
to pinpoint the professionals involvement 
harlan hank kosmata a wppss liaison with the 88 utilities 
that contracted with wppss to build the plants has spent 15 days 
testifying about events that led to the default he was to continue 
his testimony today 
the 17member jury has heard hours of taped meetings of utility 
representatives discussing the plants funding and construction 
problems 
the three professional defendants are being sued by a class of 
more than 24000 past and present bondholders 
chemical bank of new york a trustee for bondholders sued only 
the utilities it will remain in the case as long as snohomish 
remains a defendant 
the plaintiffs claim that the defendants lied and hid information 
that might have discouraged potential investors in the wppss 
municipal bonds the defendants deny the charges 
wppss defaulted on the bonds in 1983 after scrapping the plants a 
year earlier 
on tuesday the justice department approved a 35 million 
settlement contribution by bonneville power administration the 
power broker in the pacific northwest 
boards and commissions for the 14 utilities approved settlement 
proposals monday bringing their share to 181 million

when a wave of hotstock thinking overruns the 
stock market as it does from time to time and is doing now it is 
easy to forget what sensible investing is all about 
the truth of the observation was illustrated recently when an 
investment guru grew enthusiastic about a contrarian mutual 
fund basing his support for it on the belief you should do the 
opposite of what the crowd is doing 
contrarian thinking has many supporters but it is only in 
hotstock times like these that the fund mentioned could be 
considered contrarian 
the funds recipe for winning includes 
1 finding companies offering products or services that people 
want 
2 determining if better management of a company could turn it 
around 
3 finding companies with undervalued assets that might be sold 
to pay down debt and enable the company to focus on profitable areas 
4 determining a companys earnings potential and time needed to 
realize that potential 
contrarian all four would be criteria on any basic investors 
list that is at times other than now when investment analysts 
have forsaken many of the fundamentals while searching for the next 
takeover candidate 
signs of the times can always be found in hot investment markets 
since it is here that peoples frustrations dreams ambitions 
greed and follies become focused add fear to that list its been 
there since the market crash 
reflecting the insecurity of todays investment markets 
newsletter writers are promoting almost any conceivable scenario 
millions of people can attest to it since they are recipients of 
the promotional literature 
heres one with a message so urgent it begins on the outside of 
the envelope 
imagine the prime rate will reach 35 percent gold will 
surpass 1800 an ounce real estate will fall to 1 cent on the 
dollar oil at 25 cents a barrel 
the message continues inside an overnight real estate crash it 
states might make your 175000 home worth just 1750 in one day 
dont scoff says the writer its happened before and will 
happen again 
youd better hurry if you want to get this inside information 
sign up now and pay only 39 a year a saving of 110 
what you say no way well perhaps youll reconsider when you 
find that this same seer foresees a dow jones industrial average 
now more than 2000 points falling to 41 fortyone 
wherever money is being saved spent or invested you can find the 
signs and portents did you know that there is a direct correlation 
between newhome lot sizes and interest rates its being touted as 
almost infallible 
us housing markets a publication of lomas mortgage usa traced 
the relationship for the past 11 calendar years and found it happens 
every time when interest rates fall lot sizes go up when they 
rise lot sizes fall 
in 1982 for example conventional mortgages averaged 1514 
percent and lot size was only 8265 square feet the lowest between 
1977 and 1987 last year the mortgage rate fell to 931 percent 
and lot size rose to 9295 feet 
taxes of course emit signs of the times and right now the 
signs seem to be pointing to confusion there is good reason for 
this since in 1986 there was enacted a tax simplification act that 
of all things complicated matters 
following the tax reform act of 1986 there came the revenue act 
of 1987 and the technical corrections bill now before congress the 
result according to the arthur andersen tax guide and planner 
for 1989 is that some taxpayers seem to be giving up hope of ever 
developing effective tax strategies 
tax reform was supposed to free people from the quirks of 
lawmakers and the internal revenue service instead say the 
andersen folks people feel they are at the mercy of the lawmakers 
and the irs 
they are confused and confusion is perhaps the most significant 
sign of the times

a quick glance at the range rover might not excite you 
but open the door and let the smell of leather waft your way 
climb up and lounge inside the roomy interior 
take the range rover out on a tortuous dirt road and revel in the 
ohsosmooth ride head out for the paved highway and marvel at the 
lack of road noise 
this is what a luxury fourwheeldrive sport utility vehicle is 
all about the british have known this since 1970 when the range 
rover a descendant of the hearty land rover was introduced 
since the range rovers us debut in march 1987 it has been 
winning hearts here too range rover passed its own target of 3000 
sales in its first 12 months in this country posting sales of 3350 
by march 1988 
a recent survey of range rover buyers showed a startling 95 
percent would buy the vehicle again and 98 percent would recommend 
one to a friend dont think range rover buyers arent selective 
were talking actors tom cruise and don johnson comedian tracey 
ullman and band leader doc severinsen among the thousands of buyers 
british royalty also are range rover fans 
average household income of buyers is 200000plus and average 
age is 435 years range rover says a majority pay cash for the 
vehicle which starts at approximately 35000 
the company says purchasers also have active lifestyles meaning 
trips to beach houses fishing hunting skiing excursions etc 
twentyfive percent of the primary drivers are female nearly 
everything youd expect in a luxury sedan is standard on the range 
rover air conditioning premium amfm radio with cassette player 
and antitheft device cruise control and power seats and windows 
for example 
the only options are leather upholstery 1125 sunroof 
1375 and beluga black exterior with burled walnut interior trim 
1500 yet the vehicle has all the necessities of a sport utility 
vehicle and more 
besides the alwaysengaged fourwheeldrive there are 
longtravel coil springs at each of the four wheels to give that 
smooth ride even on bumpy dirt roads 
besides the high riding perch and high center of gravity there 
are four michelin tires that were specially designed to bite into 
tough terrain and alternatively travel pavement without the whirring 
sound often heard in sport utilities 
besides a big aluminum block general motors corpdesigned v8 
there are fourwheel disc brakes theres also a tollfree telephone 
number to call for help even if you run out of gas 
and range rover says the threeyear 36000mile warranty which 
covers the complete vehicle except tires is the best in the 
industry for a vehicle of this type 
the test vehicle a range rover in beluga black with burled 
walnut trim on the doors was one of only 150 limited editions at 
first glance it looked utilitarian outside boxy and rather 
unmodern 
climbing aboard you really have to swing up it almost felt 
like a tank with a thick steering wheel and the engine rumbling 
under the hood but the image changed once the range rover got 
moving 
it was fairly easy to maneuver didnt seem to need a real wide 
turning arc and was capable of taking on almost anything in its path 
it went up a steep hill of gravel and down the same hill with 
less effort and stress than i did at the wheel it went through sand 
nearly effortlessly it traversed gulches with ease 
it made a believer out of me on highways and neighborhood 
streets the range rover offered a good view in all directions 
because of the high riding position 
braking was superb for a vehicle of this type the suspension 
offered decent handling even considering the high center of gravity 
which tends to make all sport utility vehicles less stable than 
autos 
the range rover has aluminum body panels welded to a steel frame 
so rust problems are kept to a minimum 
the vehicle can tow up to 7700 pounds though 5000 pounds is 
the optimum 
but even the range rover isnt perfect the driver side doorway 
has no handle at the ceiling or window pillar to help the driver 
climb aboard it would have helped especially on the days i wore a 
skirt 
the engine while a mighty v8 that does admirably offroad 
didnt have much pickup the vehicle kind of lumbered into traffic 
it also slurped fuel the government rating is 14 miles per gallon 
combined city and highway driving 
consumer reports does not list the range rover in its survey of 
owner problems 
range rover says it is the first in this ultraluxury sport 
utility market in the united states about the closest competitors 
are a leatherappointed jeep cherokee limited for about 25000 and 
the jeep grand wagoneer for more than 25000 but thats destined 
to change when a 38850 laforza sport utility vehicle goes on sale 
in the united states 
it has a body and interior by italian coachmaker pininfarin and a 
ford v8 engine 
range rover which is not expected to change substantially its 
vehicle for the 1989 model year beginning this month is not 
worried as spokesman bill baker said we have an 18year heritage 
of proven performance

who wants to buy the sears tower 
not me says donald trump 
not us say the japanese 
but local realestate auctioneer joel zegart believes these big 
spenders will be among the bidders if sears roebuck and co buys 
his proposal to hold a public auction for the worlds tallest 
building 
i think its a smokescreen zegart president of jbs amp 
associates inc said wednesday of the many denials among those seen 
as the most likely bidders for the 110story headquarters of the 
nations largest retailer 
i think a lot of people are interested and they just arent 
showing their cards yet he said 
sears announced monday it would sell its famed skyscraper as part 
of a corporate restructuring designed to boost profits 
sears spokesman douglas fairweather said the company received a 
number of inquiries following its announcement but he would not 
reveal the identities of the interested parties 
fairweather also would not comment on the idea of a public 
auction 
he said the sale which is being handled by goldman sachs amp co 
in conjunction with sears own coldwell banker realestate and dean 
witter reynolds financial units would be negotiated privately with 
selected prospective buyers who would be invited to submit bids 
but zegart whose firm specializes in auctions of large 
investment properties said a public auction open to all would 
generate tremendous interest and result in a sale at the highest 
price sears could hope to receive 
he said he would start the bidding at 800 million analysts say 
the building could fetch as much as 18 billion 
zegart comparing the oneofakind sears tower to a work of art 
said an auction of the building could be as lucrative as the 1987 
auction of van goghs sunflowers was to the seller in that case 
japans yasuda fire and marine insurance co paid 40 million for 
the painting by the dutch impressionist 
the sears tower is a building that youll never see reproduced 
again zegart said 
youre buying a piece of chicago when you buy the sears tower 
its the gem of the downtown its history its a landmark its 
known around the world 
several japanese firms say those are precisely the qualities that 
make them wary 
this is like buying a piece of americas heart tokyobased 
investment analyst masahiko muranaka told the chicago tribune 
that building is a symbol of america and no japanese company 
would be courageous enough to try and buy it naoya nishimura 
manager of overseas real estate for mitsubishi trust amp banking co 
told the tribune it would be like trying to buy the empire state 
building 
the trump organization which was also seen as a likely bidder 
for the tower is not interested in the sears building spokeswoman 
norma foerderer said 
donald trump who made his name and fortune in new york real 
estate owns manhattans plaza hotel and trump tower as well as 
other properties there and in atlantic city nj he recently agreed 
to buy eastern airlines northeastern shuttle service 
sears struggling to improve its earnings after three consecutive 
quarters of declining profits announced the planned sale of the 
tower as part of a restructuring that also included the proposed 
sale of its coldwell bankers commercial real estate subsidiary 
sears also said it would buy back 10 percent of its 380 million 
outstanding shares and take 425 million in fourthquarter charges 
the company said it would concentrate on consumeroriented 
businesses retailing insurance residential real estate and 
financial services it announced a revamping of its retailing 
strategy saying it would adopt the everyday low pricing policy that 
has worked for its discount store competitors

schering ag has been informed that 
usbased icn pharmaceuticals inc intends to amass up to 25 
percent of the west german company a schering spokesman said 
wednesday 
the spokesman said icn has told schering it intends to acquire 
and hold 15 million worth of the common stock in the 
pharmaceuticals and chemicals group which would amount to about 1 
percent of its outstanding shares and may later increase the 
holding up to 25 percent 
ralph harenberg scherings spokesman said the company considers 
icns bid for its shares as a hostile offer 
schering ag has notified icn pharmaceuticals that schering 
regards any sizable purchase of its stock as unwelcome the german 
company said in a statement 
there was no answer at the costa mesa calif office of an icn 
spokesman when a reporter called for comment 
harenberg said scherings largest shareholder the insurance 
giant allianz ag holds 6 percent of its shares the rest of the 
shares are held by about 42000 individual investors 
he said icns bid will be blocked by his companys voting rights 
limitation that restricts the execution of voting rights to a 42 
percent stake 
we dont believe a takeover is possible harenberg said 
the voting rights limitation clearly demonstrates the desire of 
scherings stockholders to assure a wide distribution of scherings 
stock the company statement said 
icn which had 121 million in sales last year approached 
schering in late september with an offer to purchase an unspecified 
stake in the german company but the offer was rejected harenberg 
said 
he said the company initially learned of icns actions from a 
request by the us federal trade commission which asked schering 
for the stock data after icn had registered with the ftc its intent 
to seek a stake in the german company valued at 15 million dollars

a battle over americas industrial future 
is being fought in this chicago suburb where the nations last 
major manufacturer of televisions is under siege from wall street 
the struggle for zenith electronics corp is being watched 
closely by washington silicon valley and foreign capitals because 
of what it could mean for the future of the united states in high 
technology 
two new yorkers who ordinarily specialize in stock market 
speculation are asking zenith shareholders to decide by dec 4 
whether to dump the companys chief executive from the board of 
directors and install them 
the wall street arbitragers say they want to get rid of zeniths 
moneylosing television business if they win they will seek a 
buyer for the tv business or if necessary sell the whole company 
which includes a successful personal computer division 
the challenge by brookhurst partners comes ironically at the 
very time many experts are saying the united states needs to have a 
homebased tv manufacturing industry as a matter of national 
competitiveness if not national pride 
an emerging theory says the sharp bright televisions of the 
1990s will be so crammed with advanced electronics that the united 
states must keep its hand in the business or fall to secondrate 
status in entire fields of electronics 
highdefinition television so called for the striking clarity of 
its picture will have 1000 to 1250 horizontal lines on a screen 
twice the current number permitting vivid color and sharp detail 
worldwide sales could hit 40 billion a year in the coming decade 
right now japan is far ahead 
highdefinition tv has become a symbol of a much larger issue 
which is whether the us is going to lose control of the driving 
forces of economic growth for the first time since henry ford 
invented the modern assembly line argues fred branfman director 
of rebuild america a group that favors governmentindustry 
partnerships 
it is hard at first to swallow the argument that televisions 
the boxes that bring us wheel of fortune are vital to national 
security but americans have begun to learn what the japanese always 
knew that success in exotic technology depends on having a solid 
base in household items 
consumer electronics give japanese companies invaluable 
experience in making things small reliable easy to use and 
inexpensive lessons they apply to invading such american 
strongholds as mainframe computers 
although consumer electronics is not a highprofit business it 
is so large that japan with half the us population has surpassed 
the united states in consumption of computer chips 
in the electronics business size is strength the south koreans 
and taiwanese among others are following japans biggerisbetter 
strategy as they pile up trade surpluses with the united states 
zenith by itself is not all that important in spite of its 
illustrious history it is only the worlds 13th largest color tv 
maker tied with a finnish company called nokia corp 
but if zenith cannot make it in televisions it is not clear what 
american company can zenith after all has a famous brand name 
strong relations with retailers and the advantage of already being 
in the business 
for an outsider jumping into the tv business would be like 
trying to hop onto a speeding train that explains why giants such 
as international business machines corp have not started making tvs 
in spite of their public statements about the importance of a us 
presence in the industry 
should a big us company other than zenith gear up a factory to 
make the next generation of televisions 
for the good of the country yes for the good of their 
shareholders no the stock would go straight down said stephen 
balog an electronics analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc 
standing up for zenith is jerry k pearlman 49 the chairman 
president and chief executive a 17year veteran of the 70yearold 
company who is looking for ways to return its tv business to 
profitability in spite of cutthroat foreign competition 
with deliberate vagueness pearlman says possibilities under 
discussion include types of cooperation such as sharing factory 
space with other companies selling other companies products under 
zenith labels and selling zenith products under other labels 
opposing pearlman are the partners of brookhurst herbert b 
abelow 54 and nicholas l ihasz 44 who fled hungary with his 
family after soviet troops quashed an uprising in 1956 
abelow and ihasz are being cast as villains by the zenith forces 
but they say they are simply asking the shareholders the companys 
true owners what they think should be done with the company 
i come from a communist country i think owning shares is like 
having the right to vote ihasz said this is the most 
democratic process i can think of 
life was simpler in 1918 when two wireless radio enthusiasts 
named rhg mathews and karl hassel began making sets on a kitchen 
table in chicago for what would become zenith 
among those who used zeniths early radios were king alexander i 
of yugoslavia and donald b macmillan the arctic explorer zenith 
began making televisions in 1948 and became famous for its slogan 
the quality goes in before the name goes on 
by the early 60s the asian invasion of consumer electronics was 
well under way there were 27 usbased tv makers in 1960 18 in 
1968 nine in 1974 five in 1984 and two in 1987 according to a 
countdown by ieee spectrum a magazine for electrical engineers

the latest us company to drop out was mighty general electric 
co which decided in 1987 that the ge and rca television lines were 
not core businesses and sold them to frances thomson sa 
it was widely assumed that if ge got out of televisions zenith 
at a tenth the size could not be far behind some wall street 
analysts became exasperated when pearlman hung onto the moneylosing 
business after all 
zenith gets half its more than 2 billion in annual sales from 
personal computers and related equipment surprisingly it sold more 
atcompatible personal computers last year than anyone including 
ibm 
thanks to computers zenith expects to make a small pretax 
profit this year for the first time since 1984 but its consumer 
electronics business mainly tvs has been running in the red 
zenith says foreign companies are dumping tvs here at illegally 
low prices and accuses the commerce department of failing to enforce 
penalties against the alleged dumpers 
whatever the reason zenith is short on money for investment and 
most likely will never manufacture complete highdefinition 
televisions its more modest goal is to get its proposed hdtv 
transmission system established as a us standard which could win 
it big royalties from the companies that actually make the tvs 
zenith also has a highly praised and patented technology for 
sharp bright computer screens which it hopes to supply to hdtv 
makers zenith is asking the federal government for 60 million so 
it can make the screens big enough to be used in the new televisions 
as well as in military equipment and air traffic control towers 
unfortunately for zenith and other us companies the japanese 
have built up a nearly insurmountable lead in many aspects of the 
technology 
hdtv is not just one technology its thousands of 
technologies and the japanese have ended up by dominating every 
single one of those markets said richard j elkus jr chairman 
and chief executive of prometrix corp in santa clara calif and 
cochairman of an american electronics association task force on 
hdtv 
some analysts are skeptical of groups such as rebuild america 
that urge us companies to take the plunge into hdtv on patriotic 
grounds even if an american company did get into the business it 
would probably have to buy many or most of the components from the 
japanese they say 
open up your typical pc from ibm do you see products that are 
made in japan you bet said balog the shearson analyst 
as for zenith although it says its television business is not up 
for sale it negotiated earlier this year with potential european 
and asian buyers 
the talks reportedly broke down mainly because the governments of 
the foreign parties ruled out a purchase fearing it would stir up 
anger among american voters and hurt trade relations 
zeniths appeal as the last usbased company in the tv business 
is itself rather fuzzy most companies in the tv business today are 
transnational zenith has major operations in taiwan and mexico 
while sony corp and others have thousands of us workers 
although it is dutch for example nv philips says it has more 
than 12000 us employees in televisionrelated businesses 
including 350 doing research and development 
citing the threat to the us electronics industry rebuild 
america says the federal government should support a usbased 
company or companies in manufacturing highdefinition televisions 
the support could take the form of loans shared research 
guaranteed purchases or some combination of those rebuilds 
branfman said 
the threat to us electronics is unquestionable some of it 
however stems from such fundamental problems as the inadequate us 
educational system the shortterm perspective of investors and 
managers and the high cost of money none of which is addressed by 
government support 
where american companies have been successful theyve had 
great technology and great marketing we shouldnt use trade 
barriers or subsidies as a substitute for those said doug van 
dorsten a shearson analyst in san francisco 
elkus who helped invent the videocassette recorder while at 
ampax corp concedes the difficulties but says a usbased 
consumer electronics industry is indispensable 
in this scenario zenith is an indicator of which way things are 
headed more so than a major force in its own right 
to really get our feet back in this hdtv market were going 
to be talking about something well in excess of a billion dollars 
well in excess he said 
zenith will not save the world this is a problem thats so 
much bigger than pearlman and zenith that you cant imagine

the new yorkers who are out to sell zenith 
electronics corps televisionmaking business admit their public 
image leaves much to be desired 
in glenview ill herbert b abelow and nicholas l ihasz are 
seen as getrichquick artists in new york where getting rich 
quickly is an honorable pursuit they are seen as inexperienced 
in a recent interview in their 41stfloor offices near the new 
york stock exchange the men said they are simply exercising their 
rights as partowners of the company 
in the late 1800s management worked for shareholders but 
management just started to think of the companies as their own 
places abelow said 
in billiondollar companies such as zenith abelow said 
ownership is spread so thin that individual shareholders feel they 
have no power 
meanwhile he said directors and managers dont care about 
shareholders because they themselves have only tiny stakes in the 
company 
driving the point home brookhurst partners says its 61 percent 
stake in zenith is bigger than the stake of all 27 zenith directors 
and officers combined 
the bottom line is were investors and shareholders like any 
other shareholders abelow said were not trying to scrub this 
company or junk it or give it away to a foreigner 
all were really trying to do is ask the shareholders what 
their preferences are ihasz agreed 
abelow and ihasz say zenith management has shown no ability or 
even serious commitment to make its television business profitable 
their goal is to boost the price of zeniths stock by finding a 
buyer for the consumer electronics business or if no one wants just 
that part to find someone who will buy the whole company 
that naturally is not the way zenith sees it 
what we have here in part are a couple of guys who say this 
appears to be easy said jerry k pearlman zeniths chairman and 
chief executive somebody comes along and bails you out and you 
have a quick bingbing turnover and youve made your reputation 
wall street analysts would be happy to see someone come along and 
boost the value of zeniths stock but some say abelow and ihasz may 
not be the right men for such a job because all their experience 
lies in the unrelated field of risk arbitrage picking stocks of 
potential takeover targets 
theres nothing in the brookhurst reports which indicates they 
understand the details of the business said james magid a senior 
adviser at needham amp co thats not who i would hire for the job 
thats a blank check 
i think that people are now coming to the conclusion that these 
people are not the right ones to do it said robert johnson an 
analyst for rotanmosle inc in houston 
ihasz worked from 1976 to 1980 for ivan boesky the speculator 
who is now serving three years in prison a point that zenith 
delights in pointing out to shareholders 
ihasz prepared for questions about the black spot on his resume 
says he was simply a functionary who had nothing to do with boeskys 
illegal trades 
i was physically distanced from him at all times i left in 
1980 ive talked to him maybe twice in the last eight years 
pearlman says he needs more time to carry out his plan for 
improving zeniths profitability accusing brookhurst of having its 
eye only on shortterm profits that does not sit well with 
brookhurst 
in one of the greatest economic expansions in history how can 
you not be profitable for almost four years ihasz responded 
what is longterm how long do you need 
we believe in capital formation all the good things were not 
against motherhood abelow said 
i think it would be good probably to have an american producer 
of televisions but i dont consider televisions to be 
necessarily a national security item abelow said 
pearlmans bottom line they picked the wrong company

rjr nabisco inc directors tried to flush out 
more offers for the giant consumer products company wednesday by 
issuing a statement saying they are interested in reviewing 
acquisition proposals 
the announcement came more than a week after kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co launched an unprecedented 203 billion tender offer 
for nabisco the aggressive new york buyout firm is offering to pay 
90 a share for the company under the condition that nabisco 
management approve the deal 
a statement issued by a special committee of nabiscos board said 
it is interested in hearing from credible parties wishing to 
present acquisition proposals 
charles hugel who chairs the committee of outside directors that 
was appointed to review takeover proposals said the group believes 
this will serve the best interest of all shareholders 
a spokesman for nabisco characterized the committees statement 
as very responsible they want to make sure the world knows if 
anyone wants to make an offer 
but market observers have said it was unlikely that a higher 
offer would emerge some even have acknowledged the possibility that 
kohlberg kravis which has begun to receive a stream of financial 
data from nabisco might even lower its bid after reviewing the 
material 
nabisco executives and their primary financial partner shearson 
lehman hutton inc were believed to be working on a 
counterproposal to kohlberg kraviss bid which would be the 
largest corporate acquisition in us history 
but there was no indication that the group would be able to match 
the kohlberg kravis offer 
in trading on the new york stock exchange nabisco rose 175 to 
close at 8675 a share on wednesday 
two weeks ago nabisco chief executive f ross johnson and 
shearson lehman said they were considering a 75ashare 17 
billion deal to take the company private since then the company 
has also signed up salomon brothers inc as adviser and financial 
partner 
rumors on wall street circulated that kohlberg kravis might be 
under pressure to withdraw from the bidding process several 
institutional investors in the firms leveraged buyout fund which 
would provide a small part of the financing for the takeover are 
balking on the grounds that the firms approach is hostile 
typically kohlberg kravis works with management members who are 
instrumental in running a target company after it is acquired

the nations largest medical association on 
wednesday sought to halt distribution of a smokeless cigarette 
saying it should be removed from shelves until it is judged safe 
for human consumption 
the american medical association filed legal petitions with state 
health authorities in arizona and missouri where the product is 
being test marketed contending that the smokeless cigarette is a 
new hazardous drug that needs further testing 
the product dubbed premier by manufacturer rj reynolds 
co contains nicotine an addictive drug which has been 
implicated in cardiovascular disease high blood pressure and 
other medical problems the ama said 
the scientific evidence is crystal clear about the adverse 
health effects of nicotine and carbon monoxide dr roy schwarz of 
the ama said at a news conference 
rj reynolds responded with a news release condending that 
premier is a cigarette not a drugdelivery system as the ama 
has alleged 
premier smoke substantially reduces many of the chemical 
compounds that the critics of smoking have been complaining about 
the release said reynolds finds it difficult to understand 
how the ama can in good faith suggest that premier be banned 
the petitions filed wednesday with the arizona board of pharmacy 
and the missouri department of health maintain that premier is a 
new drug that is being sold without prior federal regulatory 
approval 
neither state responded to the petitions immediately but each 
states laws require it to answer eventually said ama attorney 
michael zarski if officials in either state decided to pull the 
product they would be required to obtain a court injunction he 
said 
the american public has the right to expect that the products 
they consume have been judged safe for human consumption before 
being placed on the shelves for sale said dr james sammons ama 
executive vice president 
company spokeswoman maura payne in winstonsalem nc said the 
company is making no medical claims for the product and therefore 
the us food and drug administration neednt approve it in advance 
the main difference between premier and other cigarettes is 
that the tobacco is warmed not burned ms payne said 
were not claiming that premier is safe or safer than any 
other cigarettes on the market she said 
she said the cigarettes contain a nicotine level of 04 
milligrams and carbon monoxide at about the same level as a 
lights brand 
in april the ama asked the fda in a petition to regulate the new 
product as a drug although cigarettes are not ordinarily regulated 
the petition is still pending 
theres nothing in the food drug and cosmetic act which 
mentions tobacco said fda spokesman william grigg we have 
never regulated tobacco products unless they made a medical or 
drugtype claim 
the ama maintains in its fda petition that premier makes an 
inherent health claim and should be regulated grigg said 
zarski said the key to fda jurisdiction of premier is that it is 
intended to satisfy nicotine addiction and therefore should be 
treated as a drug 
rj reynolds co a subsidiary of rjr nabisco said it has 
treated premier no differently from any other cigarette 
what the company has said is that there is no health claim and 
that it is putting on this cigarette all the same warnings that are 
on regular cigarettes grigg said 
the fda has six months from receiving the petition to respond 
though final action could take much longer grigg said 
the company began selling premier in tucson phoenix and st 
louis around oct 1 but no date had been set for national 
distribution ms payne said the cost would run about 25 percent 
higher than other cigarettes 
in arizona the ama petition had been forwarded to the state 
attorney generals office for review said joe rowan deputy 
director of the states board of pharmacy they will advise the 
board as to what action they can take or should take if any he 
said 
dr robert harmon director of the missouri department of health 
did not immediately return telephone calls seeking comment

of lowerpriced gold to 160 just 5 short of the alltime high

a delaware court on wednesday temporarily halted 
the rales brothers from proceeding with their hostile 27 billion 
bid for interco inc giving the furniture and apparel company a 
chance to appeal a ruling knocking down its poison pill 
the delaware chancery court granted a stay of its decision 
tuesday to issue a preliminary injunction blocking the companys 
poison pill on grounds that it had been improperly used 
st louisbased interco has said it would appeal unless the 
ruling is reversed the brothers are almost certain to win their 
4monthold battle for interco 
the washington dcbased rales brothers through cardinal 
acquisition corp have a 74ashare tender offer outstanding that 
is due to expire at midnight wednesday it is certain to be 
extended since they are prevented from purchasing any shares while 
the stay is in effect 
but on wednesday cardinal announced that more than 29 million 
interco shares had been tendered those shares coupled with the 
raless previous holdings represent 91 percent of the companys 
outstanding stock 
a source close to the raleses called the stay a temporary 
setback for the brothers the court simply agreed to give more 
time to interco 
the raleses own 87 percent of intercos stock their offer is 
subject to 75 percent participation among intercos 362 million 
shares outstanding as well as the withdrawal of the poisonpill 
shareholder rights plan 
cardinal which opened the bidding for interco at 64 a share 
last july increased its hostile offer from 70 a share to 74 two 
weeks ago 
several attorneys have remarked on the significance of the 
courts original action in blocking the pill robert kohl a partner 
in the new york office of gaston amp snow noted that the case 
involves the limits on the strategic use of the pill in the whole 
takeover process 
the message is that a company cannot use the poison pill as a 
defense to preserve its own restructuring while a similar offer is 
on the table from an unwanted suitor 
interco adopted a poison pill in 1985 but revised it in july 
after noticing unusual trading activity in its stock days later 
interco chairman harvey saligman announced he would recommend a 
major restructuring 
in september interco countered the raless buyout overtures with 
a multibilliondollar defensive restructuring plan valued at 76 a 
share including a special 25ashare cash dividend to shareholders 
kohl noted however that the interco restructuring had a lot 
of funny money in it besides cash there are three kinds of debt 
one kind of preferred stock and one stub stock its very hard for a 
board to say that 74 in cash is wholly inadequate and 76 in funny 
money is adequate 
kohl speculated that if the interco restructuring had been valued 
20 higher than the raless offer chancellor william t allen might 
have decided differently 
in active trading on the new york stock exchange interco fell 75 
cents to close at 71 a share 
interco manufactures mens and womens apparel footwear 
furniture and home furnishings among the companys main brands are 
london fog rainwear ethan allen furniture and florsheim shoes 
company sales for the first half of the current fiscal year were 
127 billion up 3 percent from 1987

the federal aviation administration on 
wednesday awarded a 180 million contract to raytheon co for 
installation of special radar equipment to detect wind shears at 
major airports beginning in the early l990s 
powerful wind shears called microbursts have been the cause of at 
least five airline accidents that claimed more than 500 lives in the 
last 15 years including the l985 crash of a delta air lines jet 
that killed 137 people near dallas 
the contract calls for installation of socalled doppler radar 
which can detect such shears at 47 major airports at a cost of 180 
million over a number of years 
the agency also said it has an option for 55 additional radars at 
other airports costing another 100 million although no final 
decision has yet been made to expand the program beyond the original 
group of 47 airports 
faa spokesman fred farrar said the agency could provide no list 
of the airports because the location of the radars has yet to be 
determined agency officials previously have said airports with 
heavy traffic loads and susceptibility to wind shears would be given 
the greatest priority 
the terminal doppler system has a greater potential for 
realizing safety gains than perhaps any other individual item of 
equipment in the faas air traffic modernization program said 
transportation secretary jim burnley in a statement 
faa administrator allan mcartor said the introduction of the 
radar along the approach and departure paths of major airports is 
a major step in providing controllers and pilots with better and 
quicker adverse weather warnings 
a wind shear is a sudden change of wind direction that causes a 
powerful downburst of air much like water gushing from a faucet the 
downward gust of air is strong enough to literally drive a jetliner 
into the ground when it is at a low altitude such as when landing or 
departing 
under the multiyear contract raytheons equipment division at 
wayland mass will provide the first terminal doppler radar to the 
faas technical center in atlantic city nj in the fall of l991 
with the first radar for airport delivery in late l992 the faa said 
the faa has had mechanical wind monitoring equipment at many 
major airports for a number of years but experts have said the 
equipment cannot cover along the entire approach and takoff paths 
used by jetliners and therefore is of minimal benefit 
the wind monitors were in use at the dallasfort worth 
international airport when a delta air lines lockheed l1011 
encountered a powerful microburst during an approach aug 2 1985 
causing it to crash and kill 137 people 
the mechanical monitors also were at the new orleans airport on 
july 9 l982 when a pan american world airways jet encountered a 
wind shear as it took off the boeing 727 crashed killing 153 
people

had been reviewing the proposal to merge the two giant food and 
consumer products companies

the ftc after announcing its 106ashare tender offer for kraft and 
was asked late wednesday for further information 
in a statement murray bring philip morris senior vice president 
and general counsel said the company did not consider the request 
out of the ordinary especially considering the size of the deal 
he also reiterated the companys position that it did not believe 
the acquisition would violate antitrust laws aimed at upholding 
competition

would create the worlds largest consumer products company and 
second largest food company philip morris already is the parent of 
general foods the nations biggest food processer

some of americas bestknown consumer products including miller 
beer marlboro cigarettes jello maxwell house coffee velveeta 
cheese parkay margarine philadelphia cream cheese miracle whip 
salad dressing and sealtest ice cream

subcommittee on antitrust monopolies and business rights

competing lines of products and bring contended wednesday that the

the federal communications commission on 
wednesday granted rko general incs settlement agreement for 
wrkoam and wrorfm in boston ending a protracted dispute with the 
agency over alleged misconduct 
under the agreement atlantic ventures of boston would pay 277 
million for the stations of which 175 million would go to rko and 
the rest would go to other applicants that competed for the licenses 
the public interest is better served in this case by ending 
this uniquely protracted litigation which threatens to continue 
for many years to come so that rko can withdraw as a licensee and 
an unquestionably qualified licensee can take over the ownership 
of the stations and operate them without a cloud of uncertainty 
hanging over its head the fcc said 
rko a unit of akron ohiobased gencorp inc has been embroiled 
in a legal battle with the fcc that dates back to 1965 concerning 
the companys fitness to operate broadcast stations 
the fcc in 1980 refused to renew rkos license for wnactv in 
boston saying the company was unqualified to run the station rkos 
radio and tv stations in other cities are under challenge 
the commission said the settlement which gives rko only 63 
percent of the proceeds of the sale would serve as a deterrent for 
other stations that may engage in misconduct 
an fcc administrative law judge last year ruled that the 14 radio 
and tv licenses rko held should be revoked because of allegations of 
fraudulent billing and other improprieties by the company 
the fcc has indicated it would rule on the question by the end of 
this year unless the company reached settlements for all the 
stations if rko lost the licenses for the broadcast properties 
their value would drop considerably

plunged by nearly half wednesday after the company said it was 
dramatically boosting its provision for asbestos damage claim 
liability and as a result would post a big net loss for this year

suspending its common stock dividend said the plan would result in 
a negative net worth 
the companys stock tumbled 1350 to close at 15 a share on the

eaglepicher said it would boost its 59 million provision for 
current and future asbestos liability by 554 million the company 
also plans to sell three divisions for an estimated 85 million

370 in 1987 by about 4670 a share in 1988 and reduce 
shareholders equity by 499 million 
eaglepicher posted third quarter net income of 307 million or 
287 per share on revenue of 5672 million

that eaglepicher will remain solvent on a fair value basis the 
company said

share quarterly common stock dividend also plans to keep operating 
while it deals with the claims

11900 in 1986 and 20800 in 1987 the company projects that claims 
are continuing at about the same rate this year as in 1987 
the claims stemmed from an asbestos pipe compound eaglepicher 
produced for the ship building industry at the request of the 
government beginning in world war ii 
asbestos has been linked to lung diseases which show up years 
after exposure 
eaglepicher said it planned to sell its bearings chivit and 
ad weiss lithograph co divisions those divisions annually 
account for a total 96 million in pretax earnings and 109 
million in revenue 
thomas e petry eaglepicher president said the company has had 
to reevaluate its asbestos liability which was established in 1985

a credit card devoted exclusively to medical and 
dental expenses that insurance companies wont cover was unveiled 
wednesday by a subsidiary of blue cross and blue shield of maryland 
instead of paying by cash or check patients can use the card to 
pay for a school physical examination a bottleof medicine or the 
deductible on a health insurance policy said jack rapport 
president of health line inc a subsidiary of the insurance company 
the card which is called medcash can also be used for 
preventive health care such as routine doctor visits weightloss 
clinics and home bloodpressure kits 
consumers are paying for these expenses largely out of pocket 
theres an awful lot of health care that can be purchased that 
is not covered by insurance rapport said 
health line plans to market the card throughout maryland during 
the next year and eventually offer it nationwide through other state 
blue crossblue shield plans 
more than 300 health care professionals and hospitals agreed to 
accept the card during its testmarketing in baltimore 
most major medical institutions are hesitant to accept 
commercial or retail credit cards for professional services 
because of the commercialism that could be associated with that 
rapport said but blue crossblue shield already has an 
extensive relationship with virtually all major providers and 85 
percent of the providers asked to accept the medcash card agreed to 
do so 
the company started by offering the card to its employees and 
about 1000 of them signed up rapport said 
the card rapport said allows patients to separate health care 
expenditures from retail purchases and provides a form of insurance 
against unforeseen medical expenses card holders also can request a 
yearend summary of health care spending for their tax records 
the card offers initial credit of 1000 to 5000 with the 
possibility of obtaining additional coverage in an emergency by way 
of a tollfree telephone number 
a 24 annual charge will be waived the first year the company 
said 
no interest will be charged if the balance is paid within 25 
days the company charges 7 percent more than the prime lending rate 
on unpaid balances and offers a threeyear repayment plan the 
company said the prime rate is around 10 percent 
rapport said the card offers an advantage to health care 
providers by cutting the time and money they spend on bill 
collection

a federal communications commission review 
board on wednesday revoked the licenses for two georgia radio 
stations charging that their owner abused the agencys policy on 
distress sales to minorities 
the fcc review board accused silver star communicationsalbany 
inc of callous abuse of the process that allows a licensee 
facing revocation to sell their station to qualified minorities at a 
discounted price 
the board in an oct 18 ruling released wednesday reversed a 
decision by an administrative law judge and revoked the licenses for 
wmjmam and wfavfm in cordele ga 
silver star can appeal the ruling to the commission within 30 
days john robert e lee the principal of silver star could not be 
reached for comment wednesday evening 
the fcc rarely revokes radio and tv station licenses it has done 
so a total of 40 times since 1939 commission spokeswoman maureen 
peratino said 
silver star bought the stations and two others wtjham east 
point ga and wjizfm albany ga from james s rivers and 
members of the rivers family in 1984 the stations had been 
designated for a license renewal hearing because of allegations that 
rivers had misrepresented issues before the fcc 
in light of the pending hearing rivers sought a discounted 
distress sale of the stations and settled upon lee as a minority 
buyer 
the fcc said the record in the case showed that lee was primarily 
interested in buying wjiz and that he intended to sell the three 
other stations as soon as possible after acquisition 
the commission also said the record showed that rivers suggested 
that lee sell the cordele stations to rivers son ronald rivers a 
minority shareholder in the cordele stations and sara howell a 
rivers employee 
the review board said silver star abused the distress sale policy 
by acquiring at least two stations it did not wish to own or operate 
and defying an fcc policy requiring it to maintain those stations 
for at least a year before transferring control 
additionally the board noted that silver star transferred 
control to an individual silver star knew to have questionable fcc 
credentials since rivers had an interest in the cordele stations 
when they were under investigation by the fcc 
the fcc review board found that silver star willfully subverted 
the underlying intended purpose of that process it said the 
companys willful violation of the policy is compounded by 
conduct fully as egregious as misrepresentation or lack of candor 
and equally as telling as to its trustworthiness

boeing co and lot polish airlines have 
scheduled what they term a major announcement friday in new york 
amid indications lot may be ordering boeing airliners opening a new 
eastern european market 
boeing officials declined to comment wednesday on any prospective 
lot aircraft order and representatives for lot could not be reached 
by telephone 
but spokesmen for boeings commercial aircraft division said 
earlier this year that they hoped to sell widebody 767 aircraft to 
lot and to other communistbloc nations 
while neither confirming nor denying a deal was in the works 
boeing spokesman john wheeler said wednesday that a lot order would 
be the first purchase by a warsaw pact nation of newtechnology 
commercial aircraft 
sources indicated any order might be for two or three of the 
aircraft which sell for 50 million to 70 million each depending 
on model 
this summer boeing and three other major western airplane 
manufacturers mcdonnell douglas british aerospace and airbus 
industrie were granted permission by the coordinating committee 
for multilateral export control to sell newgeneration commercial 
jets to eastern bloc countries the parisbased organization 
regulates strategic exports to communistbloc countries by western 
industrialized nations 
at the time boeing spokesman bill clark said boeing hoped to 
sell three widebody 767s to lot and two 767s to tarom airline of 
romania he said there also had been discussions with malev of 
hungary and interflug of east germany 
wheeler said boeing still was discussing a possible 767 sale to 
tarom and he said malev has leased boeing 737s a smaller twinjet 
through a third party 
any sales to eastern bloc nations must be approved by the us 
departments of state commerce and defense to ensure that 
technology with critical military applications is not transferred to 
communist countries 
yugoslavias jat airline long has been a customer of boeings as 
has the chinese government tarom also bought two 707s from boeing 
in 1973 
richard albrecht boeing commercial airplanes executive vice 
president for sales and marketing in an interview wednesday would 
not discuss any specific negotiations with possible customers other 
to say were hopeful of receiving some orders from eastern 
european companies 
boeing also would like to sell jets to the soviet union albrecht 
said 
he said boeing had talked to the soviets in the mid1970s about 
selling some airplanes but nothing ever came of it however he 
said boeing officials again talked with soviet aircraft industry 
representatives last year at a san diego air show 
the largest airline in the world is aeroflot the soviet 
national carrier and i would think that we have some products that 
could provide some value to them albrecht said whether or not 
they would buy them or we could come up with acceptable terms to 
satisfy our government with respect to technology transfer is a 
question that is up to a certain degree to the soviet union and 
the us government 
albrecht said he cant imagine the soviet union would under any 
circumstances permit aeroflot to rely primarily on aircraft from 
outside the soviet bloc at least not in todays world 
but because aeroflot is so huge with thousands of aircraft 
ranging from helicopters to transcontinental jets even if boeing 
supplied only a fraction of its needs it would be very 
significant albrecht said
