a judge has ordered the defense 
ministry to pay 47 million to an electrician tortured during 
uruguays 197285 military dictatorship a newspaper reported 
thursday 
a government spokesman said the defense ministry will appeal the 
order 
the victim who was not identified by name was held without 
charge from january 1976 to may 1977 the weekly busqueda reported 
his injuries were not described but the newspaper quoted civil 
court judge carlos berlangieri as saying in his ruling that they 
prevent the man from returning to work the report did not say what 
day the ruling was made 
a crackdown on leftist subversion was a major feature of the 
military government which oversaw a return to civilian rule on march 
1 1985 
under military rule about 150 suspected leftists were killed 
compared to at least 8961 in neighboring argentina during its junta 
of 197683 and several thousand were arrested and tortured 
lawyers said they know of no precedent in uruguay for the huge 
award 
in april 1988 the san francisco district court ordered fugitive 
argentine gen carlos suarez mason to pay 21 million to horacio 
martinez baca who was tortured on the generals orders during the 
197683 dictatorship 
that is believed to be the largest federal civil award for a 
civil rights abuse 
the cashiered general however never paid the sum he was 
extradited to argentina where he was convicted of murder and still 
is jailed

seaman adolf eich crawled through a 
narrow tunnel inside the burning battleship bismarck scrambling for 
his life as british forces bombarded the third reichs most dreaded 
fighting vessel 
eich a survivor of one of the most famous battles in naval 
history recounted his tale wednesday after american explorers found 
the sunken battleship under 28 miles of water 600 miles off the 
coast of france 
the bismarck went down on may 27 1941 ending a furious pursuit 
by british warships and aircraft defending the allies crucial 
supply lines with europe 
of 2200 bismarck crewmembers only about 100 survived 
the water was red from blood and i could see at least 500 
people swimming in the sea most of them didnt make it said 
eich who was pulled from the cold north atlantic by british naval 
forces 
the us oceanographer who found the bismarck on monday robert 
ballard said the ship would remain in its resting place as an 
undersea memorial 
ballard of the woods hole oceanographic institution in 
massachusetts said the wreckage of one of the epic naval battles of 
world war ii was still rather a beautiful ship 
british naval historians hailed it as a major discovery 
the heavily armed ironclad vessel demonstrated its killing 
power on may 24 1941 when it sank the famed british battle cruiser 
hood off the coast of greenland only three of the 1425 sailors 
aboard survived 
british forces ordered to sink the bismarck at any cost finally 
caught up with it off france on may 26 launching a furious attack 
with heavy naval guns and airlaunched torpedoes that crippled the 
largest ship in adolf hitlers navy 
eich then 20 said he was in a belowdecks firecontrol room 
when the order finally came to abandon ship on may 27 
there was rubble all over the place and there was no safe way 
of getting out he said in a telephone interview from his home in 
duesseldorf 
the retired telex operator said he and another sailor halke 
franz managed to crawl out through a narrow circular passage for 
electrical cables 
eich said he was astonished by the carnage and destruction he 
found on deck 
when i came out i couldnt believe there was anyone still 
alive he said 
survivors hermann budich 69 and paul rudek 72 also have vivid 
memories of the battle 
i lost a lot of friends on that ship some of whom i knew for 
two years said budich of the northern town of bad segeberg 
rudek said he was impressed by the ships thick armored plates 
when he was assigned to the vessel as a petty officer 
at that time i thought nothing could ever happen to this 
ship said rudek of the northern port city kiel 
he said that on may 26 british aircraft began pounding the 
bismarck with torpedoes and knocked out one of the ships rudders so 
that it could only maneuver in circles 
in the early hours of may 27 the bismarcks commanders ordered 
destroyed so that it would not be seized by the british 
and then we knew the end was near rudek said 
explosives were set off near the ships drainage ports and the 
bismarck flopped over 
rudek slid into the water from the starboard side he tried 
desperately to grab a rescue line thrown by crewmen from the british 
warship dorsetshire but it was just out of reach then a wave 
shoved him closer and he was able to grab the line 
rudek said it still horrifies him to think of his comrades who 
drowned sealed inside the bismarck 
i was lucky that i went over the rail said rudek who like 
the other survivors spent the rest of the war in british prisoner of 
war camps 
the sinking of the hood the pride of the british nay was a 
tremendous blow to british morale 
but eich said many bismarck crew members formed lasting 
friendships with their former enemies and that they communicate 
frequently 
ted briggs one of three hood survivors was asked by the ap 
london bureau whether he felt any bitterness 
at first yes said the retired real estate agent and former 
hood signalman 
but when you come to think of it they were doing their job 
just as we were doing ours but the memory is with me all the time

the federal aviation administration on wednesday 
ordered airlines to ground some boeing 737400 jetliners until 
certain engines that have been operated at high thrust are modified 
or replaced 
the emergency airworthiness directive distributed by telegram 
comes after britains civil aviation authority ordered 12 of the new 
twinjets grounded following two incidents of trouble with their 
cfm563c engines 
the same model of engine was on a british midlands 737400 that 
crashed in january killing 47 people the cause of that crash has 
not been determined 
boeing co and the engines manufacturer cfm international 
issued their own advisory tuesday urging airlines to ground the 
jets until the engines are replaced or have their thrust capacities 
reduced 
the sole us operator of 737400s piedmont airlines already 
has replaced engines on the affected planes a spokesman said 
the faas order requires airlines to immediately remove from 
service all fan blades and disks on cfm56series engines that have 
been operated at 23500 pounds of thrust the agency also said as 
did boeing and cfm international that all cfm563c engines on 
737400s should be modified to operate at a maximum 22000 pounds 
thrust 
the cfm563c was designed with higher thrust to provide more 
power for the 737400 a stretched version of the widely used 
737300 the 737400 which carries 146 passengers went into 
service last year 
the faa said cfm563b engines which are rated at up to 22000 
pounds thrust and used on both the 737400 and smaller 737300 have 
had excellent reliability with no fan blade failures in a cumulative 
6 million flight hours 
boeing spokesman craig martin said the faa order affects 28 
planes with the 3c engines all outside the united states 
in addition to the british order west germany on tuesday ordered 
engines checked in the four 737400s used in that country 
last friday a dan air 737400 with the 3c engines carrying 100 
charter passengers to minorca returned to londons gatwick airport 
after developing severe vibration in one engine 
on sunday a british midlands 737400 with the same engines 
flying from londons heathrow airport to belfast northern ireland 
with 80 people aboard made an emergency landing at east midlands 
airport after a problem developed in one engine 
in both cases the airlines reported turbofan blades had been 
damaged 
in the january british midlands crash the pilot reported that 
one engine had failed in flight but investigators later found the 
planes remaining good engine had then been shut down before an 
emergency landing was attempted 
the investigation of that crash has not been completed 
cfm international is a joint venture of general electric co of 
the united states and snecma of france

an israeli belly dancer has gone to court to 
defend her shimmies as kosher claiming orthodox rabbis are shaking 
her financially by threatening to rescind the kosher certificates of 
places where she dances 
philadelphiaborn ilana raskin argued in a supreme court petition 
that food not dance should be the only basis for issuing 
kashrut licenses certifying hotels and restaurants as kosher 
ms raskin 35 said that even if dance was a criterion her own 
middle eastern variety meets standards of modesty set by orthodox 
jewish rabbis 
its a very sensual dance but its not immodest she told 
the associated press on wednesday its a proud and beautiful 
dance im living in the middle east it speaks to my living here 
ms raskin who has also worked as a counselor and has a masters 
degree in education from hebrew university started dancing six 
years ago 
she said she was dancing regularly for parties weddings and bar 
mitzvahs but found beginning in november that she was getting fewer 
and fewer engagements 
neta zivgoldman a lawyer for the israeli association of civil 
rights who is representing ms raskin said her petition submitted 
to the court monday maintains the drop in business followed threats 
to hotels and restaurants from jerusalem rabbis 
officials for the jerusalem rabbinate were unavailable for 
comment but spokesman eitan aizman of the chief rabbinate of israel 
contended that belly dancing is not modest it is erotic 
rabbi shlomo goren a former chief rabbi was emphatic in 
declaring that belly dancing was tref a yiddish word meaning 
nonkosher 
its tref tref so tref he said bellydancing is 
against judaism its against the jewish ethic bellydancing 
inflames the feelings in your body bellydancing exposes them 
he argued that not only food in restaurants should be considered 
when issuing kosher certificates but said he expected trouble from 
the court on the issue 
i think the supreme court wants to concentrate the powers 
of the rabbinate in the kitchen he said outside of the kitchen 
they dont want us to do anything 
amihud bahat the spokesman for the ministry of religion said 
kashrut certificates were not issued conditionally but that the 
ministry frowns on the idea of bellydancing in kosher hotels 
if you come from abroad looking for a kosher hotel in 
jerusalem youd expect a little yiddishkite jewishness not a 
yeshiva but certainly not bellydancing either bahat said 
its very natural that public places in jerusalem have a little 
different atmosphere from new york jerusalem shouldnt look like 
times square 
the bellydancing issue is just another collision between 
orthodox rabbis and nonobservant israeli jews the rabbinate has 
made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to halt movies and sports 
event on the sabbath 
zivgoldman said rabbinical authorities also have used the 
kashrut certification in the past to pressure for compliance with 
religious norms 
the problem does not start or end with bellydancing in 
jerusalem she said 
the court has not yet set a date for a hearing on the case 
ms raskin said she was pursing the case as a matter of principle 
as well as to regain her main source of income 
i love to dance and i love my work and when i cant do that it 
makes me sorry she said 
next motion

leave it to the amorous french who else would take 
a dilapidated 19thcentury villa and turn it into a museum dedicated 
to preserving and promoting the romantic life of yesteryear 
tourists take note not far from the hurlyburly of pigalle and 
the moulin rouge is a haven of peace and quiet tucked away at the 
end of an unpaved ivycovered alley 
the museum of romantic life is a small twostory house known as 
the renanscheffer after its most famous inhabitants the painter 
ary scheffer and historian ernest renand who later married 
scheffers niece 
restored to its former grace and charm the villa recreates the 
life and times of the writers artists and musicians who gathered 
there for his fashionable friday soirees 
among them were the 19thcentury novelist george sand a feminist 
before her time who flaunted her upperclass background by dressing 
as a man and writing about her love affairs with the poet alfred de 
musset and composer frederic chopin 
they lived in what is known today as the saintgeorges quarter a 
residential neighborhood bordered by pigalle to the north and the 
saintlazare train station to the south flooded with young artists 
who shunned the opulence and snobbery of saint germain on the left 
bank 
postimpressionist painters edouard vuillard and pierre bonnard 
shared a studio down the street victor hugo met juliette drouet 
the love of his life on the rue de clichy nearby charles 
baudelaire alexandre dumas and edouard manet were neighbors too 
while vincent van gogh later would work in his brothers art gallery 
on the same street 
located at 16 rue chaptal the house was built in 1830 with the 
accent on calm and quiet in keeping with the romantic belief in a 
return to nature it was classified as a historical monument in the 
1950s to ensure it would survive a development boom that saw the 
demise of many unprotected landmarks 
the house is flanked by gardens but also has its own glassedin 
winter garden with a fountain gushing over jasmine and mosscovered 
rocks 
the museum opened to the public last weekend with a exhibit on 
george sand born amandine aurore lucie dupin she created a scandal 
by going around in male attire and wearing a dagger at her hip 
changing her name and carrying on love affairs about which she later 
wrote 
the ground floor features a recreation of her living room 
decorated with family portraits and etchings and with magnificent 
period furniture which has been in her family for generations also 
displayed are dozens of knickknacks jewelry letters and even 
snippets of her baby curls framed under glass 
on show until oct 1 is a special exhibition of three versions of 
le larmoyeur the weeper one of scheffers bestknown 
paintings 
though he has fallen into neartotal oblivion scheffer was one 
of the 19th centurys most successful artists scorned by the 
critics but adored by the public he even gave drawing lessons to 
king louis philippes children 
scheffer is very interesting to art historians because he is at 
the crossroads of all the tendencies and influences of the 19th 
century said museum curator annemarie brem but the critics 
gave him a bad time when he began to paint like delacroix or like 
ingres and lost his own style 
mrs brem said the museum can handle about 100 people 
comfortably but that every effort was made to keep it homey and 
intimate as if somebody still lived there

studies that began 14 years ago on the outside before his 
conviction for murder in vicente and arrival at san quentin in 1979 
a published poet short story writer and editor of the san 
quentin news chattman wrote a 65page thesis on capital punishment 
while he was doing time in the hole because authorities 
suspected him of drug trafficking inside the prison 
he said his isolated incarceration may have improved the papers 
quality theres a lot of solitude in there

on his degree on saturdays inside his 4by11foot cell

a hotel in central beijing watching as soldiers come and go from 
the lobby once bustling with travelers 
troops are staying here you dont want to stay here a man 
whispers to a foreigner asking if chongwenmen hotel is open 
at a nearby restaurant employees in the darkened building 
shrugged wednesday when asked if the business will reopen 
we dont have any foreigners one man said as he and two 
other employees sat idle at maxims restaurant we need foreign 
people to make money now we have no work 
the violent crackdown on chinas prodemocracy movement 11 days 
ago has prompted an exodus of foreigners bringing tourism to a near 
standstill 
while some city residents try to get on with their lives workers 
at shops markets and hotels seek to overcome the potentially grave 
economic prospects facing businesses that depend on tourism 
a vendor of mao tsetung memorabilia responds bitterly when asked 
about business 
americans dont like us they say china is bad they dont like 
senior chinese leader deng xiaoping so they leave china and others 
leave too 
now no one buys my things so i sleep or listen to the radio 
before the turmoil the market near a foreign diplomatic compound 
was filled with people browsing or trying to strike a deal now 
hopeful vendors carefully display silk items handcarved 
knickknacks and westernstyle clothing but the market appears 
abandoned 
another man responds to a question about business by spreading 
his arms and making a noise to imitate a plane taking off 
managers at some tourist hotels gave dire reports 
we could not go on like this for very long said rudolph 
staudinger manager of the twoyearold shangrila hotel we have 
not paid back the bank loan 
he said staff members will be paid for staying home while 
business is slow 
but he added some of our regular customers some who left 
because of safety concerns are planning to return those are good 
signs 
he said 100 of the hotels 780 rooms were occupied tuesday many 
by businessmen who travel to china frequently 
at jianguo hotel now one of the journalist enclaves in the city 
manager peter hierzi said he may offer free breakfast tea 
cocktails and newspapers to attract guests for now the hotel is 
encouraging employees to take vacation time 
when demonstrators flooded tiananmen square last month the 
landmark beijing hotel offered prime views of the square and the

attraction 
now the grand building is nearly deserted cafes and souvenir 
shops are dark from time to time the telephone rings but goes 
unanswered

reduced weaponsbuying budget without change according to an 
interview report 
in thursday editions of the washington post rep les aspin 
dwis was quoted as saying that members normally would rearrange 
the weapons requests to add or boost spending for weapons bought in 
home districts 
this time its different aspin was quoted as saying 
some members have told him of plans to propose restoration of 
68 billion in weapons spending to the 10 billion in proposed cuts 
announced by defense secretary dick cheney in april aspin said 
but he said he knew of only about 1 billion in possible cuts 
that could be made to offset those additions without cutting other 
weapons programs 
somebody else is going to have to lose what they already have 
in the budget if these addons are approved aspin was quoted as 
saying 
in an atmosphere clouded by scandals among the democratic 
leadership many committee members think a vote for the cheney 
budget will look like a goodgovernment vote aspin was quoted as

with the successful maiden launch of 
the huge titan 4 the pentagon has an unmanned rocket that lessens 
its reliance on the space shuttle for lifting heavy military 
satellites into orbit 
nearly 40 of those satellites have languished in storage for lack 
of a launch vehicle since the shuttle challenger exploded more than 
three years ago 
the 20storytall titan 4 made a spectacular debut wednesday when 
it thundered off its launch pad with a 2ton satellite designed to 
provide instant alert of a missile attack on the united states 
it was the most expensive unmanned space mission ever by the 
united states with the 220 million rocket the 180 million 
satellite a 45 million payload booster stage and other costs 
raising the total to close to 500 billion 
the air force reported the big rocket had successfully passed its 
maiden test and placed its military satellite in orbit 
this is an important milestone for the air force because its 
the first titan 4 our new heavy lift launch booster which will give 
us assured access to space for our critical heavy national security 
payloads said lt col ron rand an air force spokesman 
the air force reported only that the rocket launched wednesday 
carried a classified payload which it would not identify for 
national security reasons 
however it has been widely reported by knowledgeable observers 
and by aviation week and space technology magazine and other 
publications that the rocket carried an advanced missile warning 
satellite 
the satellite is the first of a new class that uses an infrared 
telescope to detect an allout nuclear missile attack on the united 
states within a minute of launch said john pike associate 
director of space policy for the federation of american scientists 
this quick alert would give the president and military units 15 
minutes to prepare for a submarine missile attack from the atlantic 
or pacific oceans or 30 minutes for a landbased strike from within 
soviet borders he said 
defense department officials decided after challenger exploded in 
1986 that they were relying too much on the manned shuttle for 
critical military payloads so they more than doubled the number of 
titan 4s on order and authorized development of two new smaller 
rockets the delta 2 and atlas 2 for mediumsize payloads 
the delta 2 made its debut in february carrying a navigation 
satellite into orbit it repeated with another navigation payload 
saturday 
the shuttle flights resumed last september and the second flight 
in december deployed one of the backlogged heavy military 
satellites two more are scheduled on shuttle flights later this 
year with at least one more titan 4 launch planned 
the pentagon hopes eventually to shift most of the payloads to 
the titan 4 which can boost 39000pound payloads to an orbit 150 
to 300 miles high or propel 10000pound packages to socalled 
stationary orbits 23000 miles up 
the us once had a much more powerful rocket the saturn 5 that 
launched apollo astronauts to the moon it could hoist 240000 
pounds into orbit the new soviet energia rocket the worlds 
largest rocket has nearly the power of the saturn 5 
both the air force and national aeronautics and space 
administration are studying designs fpr a large advanced booster 
capable of lifting between 150000 and 200000 pounds to orbit 
the space shuttle can deliver 55000 pounds

even ronald reagans personal check for 120 
couldnt persuade sen howard metzenbaum to help the republican 
party rid the senate of ultraliberal democrats 
metzenbaum the junior senator from ohio is one of those 
democrats who doesnt think liberal is a dirty word 
so when he received a gop fundraising letter urging him to match 
reagans donation his reply to sen don nickles chairman of the 
republican national senatorial committee was brief 
though i cannot send you any money for your efforts i can send 
you my heartfelt wish that you achieve the same success in 1990 that 
the gop earned in the 1988 senate race in ohio he wrote 
metzenbaum also suggested he could teach the partys national 
chairman a thing or two about campaigning 
i could demonstrate to lee atwater that republican smear 
tactics end up tarring the gop and irritating the voters he 
wrote i have copies of some gop commercials from 1988 that

metzenbaum attributes part of his reelection landslide last year 
to voter backlash after his republican opponent cleveland mayor 
george voinovich accused him of being soft on child pornography 
metzenbaum who was rated by americans for democratic action at 
80 percent for votes on liberal issues in 1988 was one of thousands 
of people who were sent the solicitation rnsc communications 
director wendy democker said 
the glossy fundraising packet seeks charter members of a 
republican presidential task force whose mission is to elect a 
republican majority to the us senate in 1990 
it tells recipients they were chosen by a committee that included 
president bush and every republican in the us senate and urges 
them to send donations because some of the most outspoken 
combative extremist antibush senate democrats are up for 
reelection and the more of these ultraliberal senate democrats we 
can replace in the 1990 elections the better 
that the appeal was wasted on a democrat who describes himself as 
a proud liberal didnt seem to trouble democker i am sure it 
happens when the democrats do mailings too she said 
she said the mass mailing went both to regular gop targets and 
names from other lists purchased commercially the mailing list is 
very very large she said thousands and thousands of people 
got this particular mailing 
meanwhile a liberal democratic congressman from connecticut was 
sent a fancy embossed card identifying him as a sustaining 
member of the gop and asking for a donation to the republican 
national committee headed by atwater 
the mailing read yes lee you can count on me to work with 
you to make the bush administration a success for america through my 
support of the republican national committee 
rep bruce morrison said he declined to make the suggested 25 
50 or 100 donation but may keep the card if its true what they 
say membership has its privileges

with their new leadership team in place house 
democrats are searching for a legislative agenda to unify their 
party and provide a counterpoint to the policies of president bush 
this is our time to make a difference and move this house away 
from the partisan wrangling and the rancor and the bitterness and 
to reassert an agenda for progress for this country said rep 
richard gephardt of missouri elected wednesday as his partys new 
no 2 house leadership official 
but despite gephardts campaignstyle speech to his colleagues 
the new leadership team still has much work to do to assume the 
reins of power in the house and convert stylistic ability into 
substance 
while bush has made much of advocating bipartisan cooperation 
with congress his political team has shown a heightened 
aggressiveness in attacking democrats the house gop minority 
meanwhile has grown increasingly combative 
i think you still are going to have tremendous problems between 
the two parties here for at least another year said rep tony 
coelho dcalif the former whip who is leaving congress after 
today because of questions about his personal finances 
the new speaker thomas s foley of washington is an 
acknowledged statesman and thinker but some democrats wonder 
whether he will have the toughness to define and fight for the 
partys agenda 
and after a season of fighting ethics charges democrats remain 
nervous about whether rep william gray of pennsylvania the new 
no 3 party official as majority whip will ultimately be damaged 
by an fbi probe into alleged payroll padding in his office 
rep charles schumer dny said members of the new leadership 
team are extremely adept at selling the message to the american 
people our challenge now is to come up with the message 
the new leaders will work this summer on developing a party 
legislative agenda then announce sometime this fall where were 
going said rep david bonior dmich who lost the whips race 
to gray but will remain in his post as chief deputy whip 
foley already has said ethics and campaign reform will be his top 
priority democrats also are eager to pass a clean air bill and 
complete work on a savings and loan rescue package and are 
promising to pass another bill raising the minimum wage after 
president bushs veto this week 
gephardt in his acceptance speech before the house democratic 
caucus after defeating rep ed jenkins dga for majority leader 
echoed some of the themes of his 1988 presidential campaign 
america is beginning to be in a state of decline and we as 
democrats have to lead he said even though there is not a 
crisis even though the presidency is held by a different party and 
even though getting our consensus together on the democratic side is 
always difficult to do 
he acknowledged that with the white house and congress in the 
hands of different parties we seem near to a political standoff 
our country is in peril but few realize it if bush refuses to 
lead we must 
gray meeting with reporters after his firstballot victory held 
up his fist and suggested he wanted to bring democrats together into 
that kind of solid forceful block 
the midterm leadership turnover came because of the resignation 
of jim wright of texas as speaker and of coelho as whip foley moved 
up last week to be speaker leaving the no 2 and no 3 leadership 
posts vacant 
the election of gray as whip opened up the post of caucus 
chairman which is to be filled at a caucus meeting next week rep 
steny hoyer dmd currently the vice chairman is considered the 
frontrunner for that post

the civilianled government has denied 
charges by amnesty international that it has allowed the army and 
police to operate death squads 
the londonbased international human rights organization released 
a report wednesday that says 222 people have disappeared in 
political violence since president vinicio cerezo took office in 
1986 
cerezo a centrist christian democrat who took over as the first 
civilian leader in 20 years took power with a pledge to end 
political killings intimidation and other abuses of previous 
military governments 
the foreign ministry responding to amnestys charges said 
wednesday there are no death squads as amnesty international so 
irresponsibly declares 
the government of guatemala respects human rights it said 
however the ministry added the fact that isolated cases of 
violence against human rights exist does not constitute a 
governmental policy they are occasional acts that still escape the 
control of the states reorganized security forces 
in its report amnesty said such violence had at first decreased 
under cerezos government however it went on although the 
number of abuses decreased initially there has been a resurgence of 
abductions disappearances and extrajudicial executions in the 
past 18 months 
amnesty said people viewed by the government as leftwing 
peasants union members clergy academics and students have been 
singled out by death squads 
amnesty international spokeswoman tracey ulltveitmoe said cerezo 
himself was apparently not directly involved in the death squads 
but she said his government had failed to investigate the killings

about 600 of the 770000 active duty members of the 
us army will become infected with the aids virus each year 
according to a study 
the estimate was based on repeated aids testing of soldiers 
which found that 77 of every 100000 acquires the aids virus 
annually 
when testing for aids infection became available in 1985 the 
military checked recruits as well as all of its current personnel 
it found that 150 of every 100000 soldiers already were infected 
they said the rate of new infection was higher than expected the 
work suggests that the overall prevalence of infection in the army 
should approximately double in two to three years even if infected 
applicants are excluded from service in line with current policy 
the report was written by dr john g mcneil and colleagues from 
walter reed army institute of research in washington it was 
published in todays new england journal of medicine 
the study found 78 new infections per 100000 soldiers among 
white men 122 among black men and 194 among hispanic men among 
women there were 27 new infection for every 100000 whites and 75 
for blacks no new infections were found among female hispanic 
soldiers

the federal government is spending more to control 
aids than to conquer heart disease which kills 20 times more 
americans but some critics contend it is still not enough 
a report today described as the first to sum up the entire 
federal aids effort found the government this year is spending 22 
billion on the epidemic with more than half going to research and 
prevention the figure will grow to 43 billion in 1992 
we were surprised to learn the extent to which so many 
different individuals and agencies were involved in aids efforts 
said dr william winkenwerder who directed the analysis the 
breadth of the effort of the federal government was greater than we 
thought it might be 
in an editorial published with the study in the new england 
journal of medicine dr david e rogers of cornell medical college 
in new york said he believes the nation is still spending vastly 
too little on aids 
rogers said he would like to see more spending on aids education 
for people at high risk of the disease especially teenagers as 
well as disaster relief for cities most severely hit by the 
epidemic he also recommended even higher spending for basic 
research on the aids virus and new treatments and vaccines 
dr sheldon wolff of tufts medical school cochairman of a 
national academy of sciences review of federal aids efforts three 
years ago agreed that the government should put more money into 
aids 
we are not doing enough he said are we doing more hell 
yes the federal government has responded but belatedly to aids 
the analysis shows that aids spending now makes up nearly 10 
percent of the total budget of the us public health service which 
oversees government medical research and by 1992 it will account 
for nearly 13 percent 
spending on aids research education and prevention is comparable 
to other diseases that will continue to have a far greater effect 
on us mortality the report concluded 
winkenwerder former aids coordinator of the health care 
financing administration is now a physician with the southeast 
permanente medical group in atlanta 
his report found that between 1982 when the epidemic began and 
the end of this year the federal government will have spent 55 
million on illness caused by the aids virus 
this year alone federal aids spending will total 22 billion 
or about 1 percent of all federal health expenditures of this 
about 13 billion will be spent for research and prevention the 
disease will take about 35000 lives 
by comparison the government will spend 15 billion on research 
and prevention of cancer which will kill 500000 people this year 
and 1 billion for heart disease which will kill 777000 americans 
for diabetes which will kill about as many people as aids the 
government will spend 267 million federal support for such major 
afflictions as stroke high blood pressure and alzheimers disease 
will also be far behind aids spending 
however winkenwerder noted that the number of aids deaths will 
increase rapidly as people now infected get sick while deaths from 
other major diseases will remain stable 
among other findings 
aids programs funded this year by the aids budget of the public 
health service will require 1700 fulltime employees 
aidsrelated work now takes up about 40 percent of the budgets 
of the us centers for disease control and the national institute 
on drug abuse 
governmentfunded medicaid programs cover about 40 percent of 
all patients with aids 
last year federal state and private sources spent 44 billion 
on aids and 35 percent or 15 billion came from the federal 
government alone this compares with 30 percent for health care in 
general

the federal judge who presided over the trial 
of oliver l north cleared the way for the former national security 
council aide to be sentenced next week for his role in the 
irancontra affair 
in his ruling wednesday us district judge gerhard a gesell 
refused to grant a defense request for either a new trial or 
judgments of acquittal on all three counts against north 
a us district court jury convicted north on may 4 of aiding and 
abetting the obstruction of congress mutilation of official 
documents and acceptance of an illegal gratuity from arms dealer 
richard v secord 
the 45yearold retired marine lieutenant colonel scheduled for 
sentencing june 23 faces a possible 10year prison term and fines 
up to 750000 
north was found guilty of aiding and abetting the obstruction of 
congress by helping prepare a false chronlogy of arms sales to iran 
in 1985 and by destroying documents sought by congressional 
investigators 
north was acquitted him of nine other charges including 
allegations that he lied to investigators about his involvement in 
usiran arms sales and providing secret aid to the nicaraguan 
rebels 
gesell ruled in his 13page opinion there was sufficient proof 
for the jury to reach its verdict gesell also rejected the notion 
that north could not be found guilty of helping obstruct congress 
since the lawmakers inquiry succeeded in unearthing facts about the 
irancontra affair 
the criminality of legality of alleged obstructive conduct 
cannot turn on its success as the effort to obstruct an inquiry is 
an evil the statute seeks to address gesell said 
gesell also rejected norths arguments prosecutors had failed to 
prove that norths illegal acceptance of the installation of a 
13800 security system outside his suburban virginia home had 
occurred in washington where the case was brought 
gesell said the agreement to accept the security system 
developed in a continuous course of conduct some of which took 
place in washington 
the judge rejected arguments that the jury should have been 
instructed to consider that north accepted the security system under 
duress because no government agency would offer his family 
protection in the face of terrorist threats including one from abu 
nidal 
long after north heard of the threat by abu nidal he backdated 
letters indicating he was to pay for the system and he concealed the 
fact that secord had actually paid security consultant glenn 
robinette for the system the judge said 
gesell also said north could have paid for the fence with funds 
he admittedly had a reference to norths testimony he kept 
15000 in cash in a locked box in his closet 
gesell rejected norths request for a hearing to determine if the 
verdict was tainted by an april 22 letter nbc news delivered to the 
homes of jurors seeking interviews after they decided the case 
he also denied another motion which had been made under seal 
seeking a closed hearing on alleged conduct of a juror the contents 
of the motion were not released

the bush administration is pursuing covert aid 
to the noncommunist forces opposing the vietnamesebacked 
government in cambodia despite unlikely odds on capitol hill of 
receiving funds 
a senior administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said wednesday the state department realized it was 
engaged in more than an uphill battle 
its doubtful well get the increased assistance the 
official said 
members of congress say they fear military aid covert or 
otherwise could wind up in the hands of the communist khmer rouge 
the khmer rouge also fighting the phnom penh government gained 
notoriety for the brutality of its regime from 1975 to 1978 when 
more than 1 million people died under pol pot 
the sovietarmed vietnamese forces invaded in 1978 and ousted the 
khmer rouge setting up the current government 
the administration is seeking the covert aid to strengthen the 
hand of prince norodom sihanouk cambodias former ruler in 
negotiations with the cambodian government and the khmer rouge the 
official said 
the official said the administrations program to gain covert 
assistance was dealt a setback after it was reported last month in 
the new york times the times reported the administration would seek 
congressional backing for a covert program to supply rifles and 
other weapons to the noncommunist resistance 
the administration had hoped to have more time to make its case 
the official said 
robert m kimmitt undersecretary of state for political affairs 
has been visiting with members from the various committees that 
would have to approve such aid this past week but hes been 
running into a brick wall the official said 
the official said there were not very many open minds on the 
subject 
in any case the department intends to continue to make its case 
we still have to make the effort the official said 
on monday kimmit testified before a senate foreign relations 
subcommittee that the administration believes strengthening the 
noncommunist resistance will help achieve a peaceful political 
solution and prevent the return of the khmer rouge 
kimmit did not mention the covert aid plan in his appearance but 
he said the administration would continue to make clear that 
continued support for the noncommunists would depend upon their 
distancing themselves from the khmer rouge 
rep stephen solarz dny who is the author of a house bill to 
authorize overt military aid testified that us aid should be 
increased from the 7 million now planned to as much as 30 million 
solarz argued that the aid would strengthen the hand of the 
noncommunist resistance and help prevent another holocaust 
in geneva on wednesday two senior state department officials met 
with vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach to discuss the 
refugee problem in indochina and the cambodian situation was also 
discussed 
robert funseth the senior deputy assistant secretary for refugee 
affairs and deputy assistant secretary david lambertson stressed 
that there must be a negotiated comprehensive settlement of the 
conflict and that sinahouk must play an essential role in any 
transition government that is agreed upon the state department

women who smoke lownicotine cigarettes face about 
four times the usual risk of heart attacks just like those who use 
ordinary brands a study released today concludes 
for smokers who wish to reduce their risk switching to 
lowyield brands is a poor alternative to quitting the 
researchers wrote 
earlier studies have already reached similar conclusions in men 
the latest work found that women who smoke cigarettes that are 
low in nicotine and carbon monoxide face about four times the usual 
risk of suffering firsttime nonfatal heart attacks this is the 
same as the increased risk in those who use ordinary brands 
the study was based on a comparison of 910 women with first heart 
attacks and 2375 other hospital patients it was conducted by dr 
julie r palmer of boston university medical schools sloan 
epidemiology unit and published in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
the study notes that women are more likely than men to smoke 
light cigarettes and ads for these brands imply that that they are 
safe or at least safer 
the present large study offers substantial evidence against 
this claim they wrote 
nicotine and carbon monoxide increase the risk of heart attacks 
the researchers suggest that smokers who switch to lowyield brands 
manage to take in just as much of these substances by taking more 
puffs or inhaling more deeply 
the lowyield cigarettes also contain less tar other studies 
have shown that this makes them less likely to cause cancer 
although users cancer risk is still considerably higher than 
nonsmokers 
in an accompanying editorial dr neal l benowitz of san 
francisco general hospital said the movement toward the lowtar and 
nicotine cigarettes has been worthwhile 
but he added the benefits for any person of smoking lowyield 
rather than highyield cigarettes are small and the benefits of 
quitting are great

energy secretary james watkins expects a 1 
billion contribution from japan to help build the atomsmashing 
superconducting super collider according to a house subcommittee 
chairman 
rep tom bevill chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee on energy and water development says white house 
officials assured him foreign countries would provide substantial 
contributions toward the 44 billion particle accelerator to be 
built in texas 
bevill dala earlier this year had insisted he would not agree 
to fund the super collider in fiscal 1990 unless the energy 
department secured firm commitments from foreign countries willing 
to share the cost 
but on wednesday bevill agreed to legislation that has no 
requirements for any level of foreign participation and sets aside 
200 million for the collider in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
under the bill 110 would go to initial construction which 
could begin after oct 1 and 90 million would be for research and 
development 
bevills committee voted on the bill after he attended a meeting 
at the white house with president bush watkins rep john myers of 
indiana the panels ranking republican white house chief of staff 
john sununu and budget director richard darman 
watkins assured all of us that theyre going to have a good bit 
of participation bevill said late wednesday 
in addition to japan other potential contributors mentioned by 
watkins were italy and india bevill said india is the only foreign 
nation to sign a commitment to share costs of the particle 
accelerator and has promised to contribute 50 million 
although some texas legislators want to press for spending 250 
million the level sought by bush bevill warned that winning final 
congressional approval of even 200 million may be tough 
its a good project but the cost of it concerns me a great 
deal bevill said it will be up to congress to make the final 
decision 
the full committee could vote on the appropriation as early as 
next week said rep jim chapman dtexas the senate appropriations 
committee however has yet to vote on the collider and weve got 
a battle in the senate to win he said

conservative rep newt gingrich used the ethics 
case against exspeaker jim wright as a republican fundraising 
tool concluding requests for popular pressure on the house ethics 
committee with appeals for contributions 
gingrich made the fundraising appeals as general chairman of 
gopac a taxpaying organization that tries to elect republicans to 
state legislatures and sometimes aids republicans running for local 
office 
wrights ethics were made a fundraising theme because wright 
was hot and newt was so tied to that kay riddle gopacs 
executive director said wednesday 
the first of four letters was mailed just days after the georgia 
republican filed his formal complaint on may 26 1988 and the last 
was two weeks ago dated a day after wright announced he would 
resign as speaker rather than fight ethics committee charges of 69 
rules violations 
the last letter declared wright was not the only corrupt 
democrat 
the first three gingrich letters raised just short of 50000 
gopac said but no totals were available from the fourth appeal 
issued two weeks ago and sent to 45000 recipients more than twice 
the total of previous mailings 
gopac said it raised 19 million overall last year up 500000 
from 1987 
in his initial letter june 1 1988 gingrich informed 18910 
people on gopacs active contributor list he had just filed a 
complaint against wright and he asked people to send enclosed post 
cards to ethics committee chairman julian dixon dcalif demanding 
an investigation 
second will you make a contribution of 50 to gopac today 
he said 
by june 30 1988 gingrich was able to thank 1500 respondents to 
the earlier mailing for helping me force the ethics panel to 
probe wright 
but gingrich told the givers that a situation had arisen that 
could result in the investigation turning into a charade and a 
whitewash 
a democratic committee member vic fazio of california had 
cohosted a 500aplate luncheon in which the drawing card 
was none other than jim wright gingrich wrote in plain 
political terms rep fazio now owes the speaker gingrich said 
and asked contributors to mail postcards urging fazio to remove 
himself from the investigation 
and if you possibly can would you make a special campaign 
contribution to gopac today gingrich asked 
fazio who did not bow out of the investigation received 12 
postcards from the mailing according to spokeswoman laura nichols 
she said wright was in sacramento for a previously scheduled 
appearance and added to his schedule the democratic fundraiser with 
fazio 
on april 19 two days after the ethics committee publicly 
released its report detailing 69 charges against wright gingrich 
thanked 19822 on gopacs active donor list for their past help but 
said more money was needed 
some 45000 prospective contributors received a letter from 
gingrich on june 1 just after wright announced he would leave the 
house 
but hes not the only corrupt democrat gingrich wrote 
the letter also included a request for funds 
none of the allegations gingrich cited in his ethics complaint 
were included in the ethics panels statement of charges against 
wright 
in april rep bill alexander dark filed an ethics complaint 
against gingrich alleging he may have violated a rule against 
keeping gifts of 100 or more from anyone with a direct interest in 
legislation the allegation concerned a 22investor partnership that 
promoted a book of which gingrich was coauthor 
gingrich has denied wrongdoing and the ethics panel has made no 
announcement about an investigation

a bill approved by a house ways and means 
subcommittee would allow older americans to earn more wages before 
losing a portion of their social security pensions 
the latest in a long series of efforts to reduce the social 
security earnings limitation would permit those between the ages of 
65 and 69 to make almost 1100 more next year before they have to

the increase was added to a package of amendments that includes 
one to strip the social security administration away from the 
department of health and human services the administration would be 
set up as an independent agency governed by a threemember board 
appointed by the president the board would appoint an executive 
director to operate the agency 
the package now goes to the full ways and means committee where 
there is considerable support for raising the earnings limitation 
the senate went on record in favor of a higher limit earlier this 
year 
the limitation is as old as the social security system when the 
pension program was enacted in 1935 it included a prohibition 
against paying benefits to any person still earning wages before 
the first pension check was paid that was modified to bar a benefit 
in any month in which a person earned 15 or more in wages 
the limit has been amended several times in recent years as more 
people declined to take themselves entirely out of the work force at 
the traditional retirement age of 65 
under present law a person aged 65 through 69 may earn up to 
8880 without losing a part of the social security pension 
beneficiaries under 65 may earn 6480 without penalty the limits 
are increased each year to reflect inflation for each 2 earned 
above those limits the pension is reduced by 1 
starting in 1990 the penalty will be 1 for each 3 above the 
limit 
under the subcommittees bill the limitation for those between 
65 and 69 would rise next year to about 9720 and the following 
year to about 10440 the final figures would be determined by the 
full ways and means committee 
the limitation for those under 65 is scheduled under present law 
to rise next year to 6840 it would be frozen at that level for 
another year instead of being allowed to rise to adjust for 
inflation and the money saved would help finance the higher 6569 
limitation 
the amendment raising the earnings limit was a joint effort of 
rep andrew jacobs dind chairman of the ways and means 
subcommittee and rep hank brown of colorado the senior republican

the design for a 6 million korean war 
veterans memorial unveiled at the white house contemplates visitors 
walking among statues of 38 wearylooking soldiers and becoming at 
one with the figures 
the memorial to be erected on the stretch of parkland known as 
the washington mall will be built near the lincoln and vietnam 
veterans memorials when the 6 million it costs is raised 
president bush guest of honor at a flag day ceremony wednesday 
in the white house rose garden to unveil a model of the planned 
memorial said until recently the korean war was not formally 
remembered its time to remember 
also on hand were a dozen celebrated korean war veterans and 
advice columnist abigail van buren dear abby to her readers 
who has helped raise funds for the project 
bush credited the columnist with almost unbelievably raising 
330000 from readers by writing about plans for the memorial 
some 57 million americans served in korea during the 195053 
conflict more than 54000 were killed 
four pennsylvania state university architects won a contest to 
design the privately financed memorial which they said combines 
sculpture architecture and landscape design 
about half the money for the memorial has been raised thus far 
and it is uncertain when it will be constructed contributors 
include the veterans of foreign wars and the american subsidiary of 
hyundai motor co 
statues in the memorial depict 38 soldiers heading unevenly down 
a 120yard treelined path toward the american flag some of the 
soldiers face in different directions and two appear to help an 
injured buddy a red line is to be drawn down the middle of the 
platoon for visitors to follow 
a statement released by the architects said the visitor is an 
observer in the act of commemoration and is simultaneously at one 
with the figures the 39th presence 
there will be 38 statues because the war began after the 
soviettrained north korean army crossed the 38th parallel into 
south korea fighting ended with a truce on july 27 1953 
the soldiers depicted will include blacks and members of various 
ethnic groups no women are included but female nurses and other 
support personnel are to be featured on etchings on a wall that is 
part of the memorial 
bush said the korean war exemplified the american policy of 
containing communist aggression that policy he said created the 
conditions for the tide toward democracy now changing and uplifting 
our globe

chinas expulsion of two journalists mirrors similar actions by 
the chinese government in 1987 as well as moves by other countries 
in the past three years 
associated press correspondent john pomfret and voice of america 
bureau chief alan pessin on wednesday were given three days to leave 
china for their coverage in the wake of the june 34 government 
crackdown on student protests in beijings tiananmen square 
the chinese government has said nearly 300 died mostly soldiers 
but chinese witnesses and western intelligence have said the toll 
could be as high as 3000 most of them civilians 
a reporter for britains independent television news was deported 
from shanghai last week for covering demonstrations while on a 
tourist visa 
and the voa came under criticism for its broadcasts on 
prodemocracy student demonstrations in december 1986 and january 
1987 that reportedly led to the ouster of communist party chief hu 
yaobang 
beijing claimed the voa was seeking to add fuel to the fire and 
create chaos in china in august china refused to grant 
accreditation to voa reporter max ruston 
two reporters american lawrence macdonald of the french news 
agency agence francepresse and shuitsu henmi of japans kyodo news 
service were deported from china in early 1987 in connection with 
their reporting 
in october 1987 14 foreign reporters from the united states 
britain australia west germany and italy were expelled while 
covering proindependence demonstrations in the tibetan capital 
lhasa 
the government claimed they failed to obtain the necessary 
permission to work there china has controlled tibet since its 
troops moved into the remote himalayan region in 1950 
beijing deported correspondent john burns of the new york times 
in july 1986 after six days of questioning on suspicion of espionage 
for a motorcycle trip he took through a restricted area of central 
china 
some countries control the news by barring journalists entirely 
and china is far from the only one to deport reporters it considers 
undesirable among the expulsions of journalists over the last three 
years 
in april 1988 nbc correspondent rick davis was ordered to 
leave jordan for reporting it has a tightly controlled and at 
times even repressive society the action came four days after 
neighboring israel suspended the press credentials of nbc 
correspondent martin fletcher and reporter glenn frankel of the 
washington post claiming they violated censorship rules 
three journalists were among 11 britons ordered out of the 
soviet union last month on spying allegations in response to 
britains expulsion of 11 soviets also accused of espionage 
in september 1986 the soviets expelled us news and world 
report correspondent nicholas daniloff after he had been arrested by 
the kgb and accused of spying washington alleged he was seized in 
retaliation for the fbis arrest on spying charges of gennadi 
zakharov a soviet working at the united nations daniloff was 
released one day before zakharov was given probation and told to 
leave the united states 
after the first of two coups hit the south pacific island 
nation of fiji in may 1987 australian broadcast corp reporter 
travor watson was expelled more than 20 other foreign reporters 
were detained for several hours for their reports of the ethnic 
unrest 
in february 1987 reporter gerald seib of the wall street 
journal was expelled from iran after being arrested on espionage 
charges he had been among a group of foreign reporters invited into 
the country to file reports on iranian victories in the war 
against iraq 
malaysia banned the asian edition of the wall street journal in 
september 1986 and expelled two of its reporters americans john 
berthelsen and raphael pura for the newspapers reporting on a 
governmentowned bank that officials claimed could erode public 
confidence in the government 
also in september 1986 havanabased robert powell of reuters 
and noel lorthiosis of agence francepresse were expelled from cuba 
for violating the most elemental norms of professional ethics and 
respect for the dignity of cuba the action apparently was because 
of stories the reporters wrote based on interviews with an official 
of an independent human rights group in cuba 
in july 1986 washington times reporter glenn garvin and 
freelance photographer sue mullin were expelled from nicaragua 
which claimed they had cia links

until last years failed presidential bid 
richard gephardt had not lost an election and even then he was 
able to retain his house seat 
now hes the democrats majority leader elected to the no 2 
leadership post wednesday as a white knight for a party seeking 
to leave behind a full year of controversy over ethics allegations 
this man always lands on his feet said rep mike synar 
dokla a friend and supporter a lot of politicians dont wear 
well he wears better with every meeting 
from the time he cut his political teeth in the backroom ward 
meetings of st louis politics gephardt has carried the reputation 
as a rising political star 
now in his 12th year in congress gephardt suddenly is second 
only to speaker thomas s foley in the house 
his presidential campaign despite its lack of success clearly 
helped 
he has weathered the scrutiny and investigation of the 
presidential campaign and comes to this with very excellent 
credentials in terms of honesty and integrity said rep richard 
durbin dill 
we are anxious to put this whole firestorm of ethics 
controversy to rest and we believe that dick gephardt as majority 
leader will not raise any of those questions 
colleagues say the job of majority leader fits gephardt like a 
handtailored suit they praise his ability to forge legislative 
compromises and to position himself at the leading edge of national 
issues such as tax reform and trade 
he is generationally attractive popular and an issues man 
says rep dan glickman dkan dick knows the house and cares 
about issues and i think thats what a majority leader has to do 
says rep ike skelton dmo who for years rode to capitol hill 
each morning with gephardt 
he can disagree and not be disagreeable 
republicans arent so sure 
gephardt is pretty well liked on the republican side of the 
aisle but he is certainly more of a hardball player than tom foley 
is says rep mickey edwards rokla referring to the newly 
elected house speaker 
edwards complains of gephardts attacks on republicans during the 
presidential campaign and his push in the house for a retaliatory 
trade policy 
he tends to be a polarizer rather than a conciliator between 
the parties says edwards 
during the presidential campaign gephardt also drew sharp 
criticism from other democratic candidates who questioned his 
convictions and switches on social and defense issues 
in his early house years gephardt had sponsored antiabortion 
constitutional amendments and supported legislation to ban busing of 
school children to achieve desegreation he no longer supports 
either saying the changes were a natural evolution of his views he 
continues to oppose abortion but considers an amendment impractical 
indeed gephardt has advocated a practical rather than 
ideological approach to legislating 
i believe an idea is very important but it doesnt mean 
anything unless you can make it happen and bring it into reality 
he says in order to do that sometimes you have to be willing to 
change where you started 
gephardt won election to the house in 1976 after serving as a st 
louis alderman he seemed to move on the fast track almost from the 
day he arrived on capitol hill 
taken under the wing of thenrep richard bolling of missouri 
gephardt won a seat as a freshman on the taxwriting ways and means 
committee 
he got there through a formula he has repeated throughout his 
career eagerly volunteering for assignments winning the respect of 
his elders through hard work and eventually moving into the inner 
circle and replacing the old guard 
in 1981 gephardt was tapped as the primetime tv spokesman for a 
democratic alternative to president reagans tax cut plan starting 
in 1985 gephardt served as chairman of the house democratic caucus 
he retained the the no 4 ranking leadership post through the end of 
1988 
i really tried to be a caucus chairman that brought all the 
different parts of the party together all of the different regions 
and thats the kind of leader ill try to be says gephardt 
we only have strength here if were actually able to weld 
together a consensus on some very difficult issues nd that means 
youve got to have input from every corner and part of the party 
rep leon panetta chairman of the budget committee says one of 
gephardts finest accomplishments came in 1985 in negotiating a 
compromise on the grammrudman deficitcutting measure it was 
gephardt panetta says who helped democrats fashion a way to soften 
the blow of large cuts in social spending 
says synar he listens well he is very cautious and doesnt 
move in big strokes and he tests little steps to see if everybody 
is still on board but i think the key to it is listening 
he says he was seriously considering another presidential run in 
1992 but altered course when ethics controversies forced the 
resignation of speaker jim wright of texas and majority whip tony 
coelho of california 
suddenly gephardt became an obvious choice

tony coelho says hes leaving the house today 
at peace with the fact that his career as a rising star in the 
democratic party is over swallowed up by a furor over his personal 
finances 
he compares his fall from power to the time years ago when he 
lost his hope for the priesthood because of epilepsy in both cases 
he says he was misunderstood 
misunderstood as a child he says when his epilepsy was 
considered the work of demons misunderstood in the house where he 
was best known as a political strategist and the democrats 
fundraiser extraordinaire 
i dont want the party just to win i want the party to win for 
certain reasons he said in an interview citing democratic 
policies including support for the handicapped 
a lot of people dwell on the one side of me but dont pay 
attention to the other side he said in an interview and a 
couple of weeks ago they found out about the other side 
because he had improperly reported the financing of an investment 
in junk bonds he was about to become a prime republican target in 
their ethics attack 
he quit he said because he couldnt stomach the possibility of 
giving the republicans that advantage 
so my ultimate political trick was to take away from them the 
very thing they wanted most to use me he said 
coelho said his resignation will permit him to continue his work 
on behalf of fellow epileptics without being an issue himself he 
said he already has raised money to open 14 job centers for 
epileptics with hopes for 25 by the end of the year 
hes sponsoring programs to educate school children about 
epilepsy and raising money for a center at ucla to study the 
treatment of afflicted children 
when he was young he was considered possessed by demons and his 
family tried religious rituals to expunge them now he feels much 
has been done some with his help to get epileptics accepted as 
people with handicaps who can contribute to society 
ive gotten a lot of people to go public with their epilepsy 
he said why would they go public with some controversial figure 
whos coming into town why would they want to meet with him they 
wouldnt 
coelho said staying would have been unfair to his family unfair 
to the democrats and unfair to those he has tried to help 
so hes holding a bash to mark his departure today which is his 
47th birthday 
coelho says he hasnt yet chosen a new career and will spend the 
next three months making some speeches for money and mulling his 
future perhaps business perhaps at a university but probably 
never again running for office he said 
its not the first time hes had to change careers 
i was right on the verge of becoming a priest when that was 
taken away from me thats when i found out about my epilepsy 
all of a sudden at the last moment it was taken away 
but the good lord took me from that narrow pursuit to a 
different type of ministry 
in a 24year career in the house first as a staffer and then the 
last decade as a congressman coelho had a missionary zeal that made 
him a democrats democrat and a politicians politician 
the californian was only a freshman when he was chosen to rebuild 
the democratic congressional campaign committee in the wake of the 
reagan landslide of 1980 he led a strong rebound promoted to 
majority whip in 1986 he was the chief democratic votecounter for 
the 100th congress one of the most productive in history 
when it became clear this spring that house speaker jim wright 
would fall and majority leader thomas s foley would take his place 
coelho was a sure bet to become leader 
but then came the news reports about a junk bond deal a 
california savings and loan official carried him for a month while 
he arranged the financing half from the officials own bank 
coelho defends the deal but he says his failure to report the 
50000 loan was something he couldnt defend not without enduring 
two years of press prodding and public inquiry like that which cost 
wright his career 
once i made the mistake i couldnt stay here he said you 
cant be front liner in the major leagues in politics with 
mistakes

rejecting security risk allegations the 
senate gave ambassador richard r burt an 8910 vote of confidence 
confirming him as the chief us nucleararms negotiatior at renewed 
talks with the soviet union in geneva 
by its action on wednesday the senate rejected allegations by 
sen jesse helms rnc that burt currently the us ambassador 
to west germany cannot be trusted with classified information 
burt will preside over nuclear and space negotiations with the 
soviets will be chief negotiator at the strategic arms reduction 
talks 
in an hourlong debate helms who has delayed action on the 
nomination for weeks contended that burt has established a 
pattern of negligence and repeated violations raising serious 
questions of whether mr burt is fit to hold a security clearance 
but other senators including republican leader bob dole of 
kansas expressed confidence burt would perform with distinction at 
a time of promising but challenging arms control negotiations 
between washington and moscow 
we have said in the past that it was wrong to pursue 
allegations with no evidence to substantiate them said dole 
rick burt has undergone three intensive background investigations 
and has been confirmed twice by the senate for other positions 
sen joseph r biden ddel said none none of the 
allegations accusations have risen to the level of being taken 
seriously biden is a member of the senate foreign relations 
committee which voted 162 to recommend burt be confirmed 
sen orrin g hatch rutah said he voted in the past against 
confirming burt for other government positions but would support him 
now because he has proven himself 
burt a national security correspondent for the new york times in 
the late 1970s served as director of the state departments bureau 
of political affairs from 1981 to 1983 and as assistant secretary of 
state for european and canadian affairs from 1983 to 1985 when 
president reagan nomminated him to be us ambassador to bonn 
helms alleged that burt had printed allegedly classified 
information while working as a reporter that he had as an 
unmarried government official dated a reporter who allegedly 
printed classified information that he had once lost a briefcase 
allegedly containing classified information and that security 
officers had discovered a film canister containing marijuana inside 
the us embassy in bonn during burts ambassadorship 
helms said burt has said the cannister must have been left by a 
guest but said that was an excuse anyone found with drugs might use 
joining helms in voting against the nomination were sens william 
l armstrong rcolo david boren dokla quentin n burdick

people who say the democrats focus on the 
interests of liberals blacks and northeasterners can point to the 
election wednesday of rep william h gray iii of pennsylvania as 
house whip he is all three 
but gray 47 also is a consensusbuilder when he chaired the 
house budget committee he worked closely with republicans and 
conservative democrats to develop a spending plan that attacked the 
worrisome deficit and as he put it guaranteed longterm economic 
growth and compassion 
when gray was preparing to move into the budget job his 
predecessor conservative rep jim jones dokla praised his 
intelligence temperament and ability to say no to an awful lot of 
special interests 
at the same time rep bill frenzel rminn who regularly 
battled gray on budget issues praised him as a firstrate guy 
and said everybody will be able to work with him 
the budget committee chairmanship gave gray national visibility 
and made him easily the most powerful black member of congress 
after his term as chairman which was marked by great success in 
rounding up democratic votes for the spending plans he developed 
gray moved up the leadership ladder to chair the caucus of all house 
democrats 
grays elevation to party whip the no 3 leadership job was 
made possible by the resignation of rep tony coelho of california 
at a closed caucus gray defeated rep david e bonior of michigan 
and rep beryl anthony of arkansas 
in winning election wednesday gray had to overcome fears of some 
members that he himself might be tainted by reports of an fbi 
investigation of whether he had a nowork noshow employee on his 
payroll gray steadfastly denied anything improper and the justice 
department said monday that he was not a target of the probe 
gray who was born in baton rouge la has represented 
pennsylvanias 2nd district a philadelphia area that politics in 
america describes as black poor and democratic since jan 3 
1979 like his father and grandfather before him he is chief 
minister of bright hope baptist church gray is married and has 
three children 
he has had no trouble winning reelection every two years 
although his reputation as a consensus seeker prompted a 1982 
democratic primary challenge from a militant state senator who 
accused gray of selling out a thirdparty challenger in 1986 
leveled similar charges in 1986 but gray won with 986 percent of 
the vote 
gray is the no 2 democrat on the house appropriations 
subcommittee on transportation a prime assignment for one who is 
always looking for increased funding for mass transit 
an earlier assignment to the house foreign affairs committee 
when he was a freshman congressman opened the way for gray to win 
approval for an african development program he uses his 
appropriations position to foster increased aid for africa 
beyond his work on the budget committee his biggest victory came 
in 1986 when the house overrode thenpresident reagans veto and 
approved legislation imposing sanctions against south africa because 
of that nations racial policies the final bill was a compromise 
between grays position and a tougher version written by rep ron 
dellums dcalif 
gray is not always predictable in 1984 he faced no serious 
reelection challenge and spent his time campaigning for colleagues 
one beneficiary rep lindy boggs dla who was on the verge of 
losing her seat to a black challenger

a national trucking industry group says it 
wants to help develop a random drug testing program that will cover 
the nations 5 million truck drivers 
the american trucking associations executive committee voted 
wednesday to support random testing even though some of its members 
have reservations about the federal program that takes effect at the 
end of the year 
associations president thomas j donohue said truck operators 
would continue to work for improvements in the random testing rules 
drawn up by the transportation department while supporting random 
testing as a sound idea 
we have always believed that the public has a right to expect 
that the driver of an 80000pound truck is drug free donohue 
told a news conference 
the organization which represents scores of trucking 
organizations across the country previously supported random 
roadside drug testing demonstration projects set up by the 
government in four states but had not endorsed the federal random 
drug testing program announced last november 
the federal program would require random checks of 4 million 
transportation workers including airline workers railroaders and 
interstate truckers 
donohue said the new position accepts industrywide random drug 
testing as long as it applies to all truckers he said it should 
include large trucking companies as well as small operators 
selfemployed truckers and forhire operators and should cover both 
intrastate and interstate trucking 
random testing faces opposition from labor groups and several 
court challenges are pending a federal judge in san francisco last 
december blocked the proposed random testing program for truckers 
after a suit by truck drivers 
the supreme court has yet to rule on random testing although it 
has rejected some challenges to other mandatory drug testing 
donohue said his group did plan to oppose the idea that truck 
operators should have to check out laboratories that analyze the 
tests that he said is a government responsiblity 
donohue also said the industry should not be required to pay for 
rehabilitation of all employees who test positive 
we are thoughtful about our employees he said but we 
cannot be saddled with mandatory rehabilitation programs that would 
cost tens of billions of dollars a year

an overhaul of the medicare system aimed at 
curbing the cost of providing health care to the elderly by putting 
an unprecedented ceiling on physician reimbursements has cleared a 
house subcommittee 
the proposal also would establish a national uniform fee 
structure for physicians in the 90 billion program and protect its 
33 million beneficiaries by limiting the amount doctors can charge 
beyond the medicareapproved fees 
the physician payment plan is being considered as part of the 
fiscal 1990 medicare budget though it would not contribute to 
savings until future years 
this is a broad new program and it will take three to five 
years to see it fully implemented said rep pete stark dcalif 
chairman of the house ways and means subcommittee on health which 
approved the bill by an 83 vote wednesday 
the action is being proposed in response to an alarming rate of 
growth in medicare payments to doctors 
last year medicare outlays to physicians totaled 245 billion 
this figure has been growing at more than 15 percent annually for 
much of the decade more than double the rate of inflation total 
medicare spending on doctors and hospitals is expected to be up 
about 13 percent this year 
the plan is being watched carefully for possible application by 
private insurance companies which are also trying to find a way to 
cut healthcare costs 
under the package congress would set an expenditure target 
beginning in fiscal 1991 that would limit payments for physician 
services for medicare beneficiaries based on total nationwide 
spending the previous year adjustments would be made for inflation 
and increases in the number of beneficiaries 
if the target is exceeded one year the congress could order 
cutbacks the next year the initial target probably would be in the 
range of 10 percent to 12 percent stark said 
limiting increases in physician fees paid by medicare has not 
controlled spending in the program because doctors have responded by 
performing more services according to subcommittee staff and health 
officials 
theres no way under the present system to control volume of 
physician services stark said 
the american medical association strongly opposes spending 
targets as a form of healthcare rationing the group says the 
government should instead spend money to evaluate procedures being 
performed by physicians and develop practice guidelines they should 
follow 
the ama however supports the proposed redistribution of 
payments among physicians though many within its ranks whose fees 
now are reimbursed at a higher rate than other medical services 
object to the plan 
payments to physicians would continue to increase overall but 
fees for primary care doctors including family practitioners and 
internists would go up more fees reimbursed for medical 
specialties like surgeons and ophthalmologists would go up less 
the proposal advanced by the physician payment review commission 
set up by congress to advise on medicare spending for doctors would 
make the current reimbursement system more fair but more 
importantly for consumers the changes would encourage family 
practice and internal physicians to continue taking medicare 
patients said lauren leroy an official at the commission 
the bush administration has indicated its support for the 
package and the senate finance committee has been looking at 
similar reforms the medicare program has not seen any major changes 
in the way physicians are reimbursed since it was enacted in 1965

the drive to restore the death penalty in new 
york may come down to a lawmakers battle with cancer that caused 
him to meditate on life 
this week veteran state sen james donovan a republican who 
consistently has supported the death penalty told his hometown 
newspaper that he was personally opposed to capital punishment 
i would like to see the state stop financing the killing of the 
unborn as well as those convicted of capital crimes donovan the 
leader for more than a decade of the unsuccessful battle to block 
new yorks medicaid financing of abortions told the utica 
observerdispatch 
noting that he once got to sit in new yorks electric chair 
unused since 1963 the senator said it was barbaric inhumane and 
almost uncivilized 
what donovan 65 wouldnt tell the newspaper was how he might 
vote on gov mario cuomos latest veto of the death penalty 
legislation 
in the last four years the republicancontrolled state senate 
has voted to override cuomos death penalty vetoes but the the 
democraticcontrolled assembly has lacked the votes to override 
this year however death penalty advocates in the 150member 
assembly said they were within one vote of getting the 100 needed 
for an override and the political pressure began to build on a few 
democrats from new york city 
then things began to unravel in the senate 
first state sen israel ruiz a death penalty supporter was 
convicted in february of a federal felony for lying on a bank loan 
application and was thrown out of the senate he was considered the 
42nd vote in a senate where only 41 votes are needed for a veto 
override 
then last month martin markowitz another death penalty 
supporter in the senate said he wouldnt rule out a change of heart 
the day were dead is the day our positions are written in 
stone said markowitz 
even so markowitz said he still expected to vote in favor of the 
override 
now come donovans statements he underwent surgery in early may 
for colon cancer his subsequent absence from the senate has forced 
a delay for weeks of an override attempt he said hell be back at 
work monday 
thirtyseven states have enacted capital punishment laws since a 
1976 us supreme court ruling allowing executions to resume 
dale volker the chief senate sponsor of the death penalty bill 
now says hes unsure when hell schedule the override attempt 
its like a soap opera said volker

vice president dan quayle says he accomplished 
his goal during his central america trip of solidifying regional 
opposition to panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega and the 
electoral plans of nicaraguas leftist government 
we are together and its a very strong unity that we have 
quayle said wednesday as he flew back to washington from costa rica 
the vice president said he cemented a consensus among the 
presidents of costa rica el salvador guatemala and honduras that 
noriega must step down from power in panama and that the sandinista 
government of nicaragua must change its plans for next years 
elections to ensure free and fair balloting 
the central american presidents excluding nicaragua and the 
united states are backing a mediating effort by the organization of 
american states to remove noriega but if that fails quayle said 
there is a clear understanding that other options will be 
considered 
quayle was not specific but an official traveling with him who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said quayle was told costa rica was 
considering breaking diplomatic relations with panama and imposing 
trade sanctions if noriega does not go 
it was very important for them to see my deep convictions about 
nicaragua and panama quayle said of his oneonone meetings with 
the four presidents i was very emphatic very direct and i left 
no wiggle room about where the united states was coming from 
us officials have learned that cuba was willing to accept 
noriega should he leave panama and that spain venezuela and the 
dominican republic would also take him said one official with the 
quayle party 
one enticement for noriega to step down might be the assurance of 
going to a country that has no extradition treaty with the united 
states such as cuba so he could avoid having to face drug 
trafficking charges brought by a federal grand jury in florida 
president bush has said he would not consider dropping the 
indictment 
on the question of nicaragua us skepticism of the ruling 
sandinistas commitment to fair and free elections was echoed 
wednesday by costa rican president oscar arias 
at a news conference with quayle in san jose arias a nobel 
peace prize winner said the rules developed for the election next 
february have presented a situation in which having a fair and 
open election is not possible 
the sandinistas will have to meet at least a minimum standard 
so as to be considered legitimate in their election he said 
noting especially that the media access rules are unfair to 
opposition candidates 
quayle said that in his talks throughout the region he found 
agreement that nicaragua is violating terms of the regional 
esquipulas ii peace accord signed in 1987 by the five central 
american presidents

issues have introduced a legislative package to curb ocean pollution 
and create a 200 million fund financed in part by polluters

the festive first strike ceremony in a flagbedecked tent on

struck outside of an official mint 
donna pope director of the mint said the plaza was a fitting

a 300 million rural development program has 
unanimously passed the senate agriculture committee after senate 
leaders agreed to wait until next month to act on drought relief 
democrats had charged that senate republican leader bob doles 
insistence on passing drought aid for winter farmers before 
approving a rural development bill could have scuttled both measures 
but committee chairman patrick leahy dvt and the panels 
ranking republican sen richard lugar of indiana said they had 
agreed to move forward with the rural development bill and act july 
19 on drought relief 
the rural development package would provide 100 million in 
federal seed money for revolving loan funds as well as 200 million 
to improve education health services communications and utilities

hundreds of southern baptist conventioneers 
marched down the heart of the nations gambling capital leaving 
behind thousands of religious pamphlets with bewildered tourists and 
gamblers 
we need to show las vegas that we are not scared of them and we 
do not condemn them and we need to show them the love of god said 
ken render of lexington ky as he handed out new testaments on a 
thoroughfare known simply as the strip on wednesday afternoon 
but some tourists didnt know quite what to make of the sight of 
more than 200 baptist evangelists following a man carrying a 12foot 
wooden cross marching to caesars palace in 109degree heat 
i dont think they belong in las vegas said darlene klemm of 
oconomowoc wis 
the twomile march came after an evangelism conference at the 
midpoint of a threeday meeting of southern baptists the nations 
largest protestant denomination with 148 million members the 
convention ends today 
led by arthur blessitt a hollywood evangelist who has carried 
his 80pound cross in more than 100 countries in the past 20 years 
the evangelists left religious literature in casinos in the place 
of circulars advertising sex shows and in the hands of tourists 
gamblers and casino workers 
rb chandler pastor of mount airy baptist church in mount airy 
md said the pointblank truth is that everybody in the world is 
either bornagain or not the idea is hopefully we would catch some 
people and tell them about christ for the first time 
chris martin of park forest ill got off a bus in an 
unscheduled stop when he saw the baptists in front of caesars palace 
as they prayed i accepted the lord he said but he has no 
plans to give up gambling 
other tourists viewed the evangelistic effort differently 
dwain moore said he thought the baptists were a little too 
pushy in trying to evangelize people on the street 
his wife thelma said they were both methodists and the 
methodists dont do it 
las vegas residents took the evangelism in stride 
these are nice decent people but i dont think they can do 
much to change our image or our thinking said don capaldi a cab 
driver 
larry williams a bellman at the stardust said what can it 
hurt to give people the bible we need to go back to more of that 
some southern baptists have already revised their opinion of the 
city 
sodom and gomorrah was how george mitchell the mayor of a 
small town in western colorado and a member of the rifle southern 
baptist church envisioned las vegas 
but he said wednesday he discovered average residents of the 
gambling mecca seem to be all godfearing people 
the decision to meet in las vegas evoked controversy within the 
protestant denomination with some southern baptists deciding to 
stay home rather than bring their families to a city built on vices 
they condemn 
leaders of the denomination which has pledged to evangelize the 
world by the turn of the century responded by emphasizing 
evangelism at this years convention 
a series of revivals were held last week in las vegas churches 
and nearly 2000 people participated in a doortodoor 
evangelization effort that led to more than 350 confessions of 
faith church officials said 
the denomination hopes to start 25 new churches in nevada by 
years end about 22000 southern baptists in 71 churches are in 
nevada 
once one of the nations fastestgrowing churches more than 
doubling in size in the past quartercentury the southern baptist 
convention has grown by barely more than half a percent each of the 
last two years the lowest growth rate since 1937 
blessitt said the community sometimes known as sin city was not 
being singled out were not picking on las vegas we want it 
known look out world were going everywhere

a change that put teeth into the security 
at the federal courthouse left one judge almost toothless 
us district judge thomas a wiseman jr activated a metal 
detector three times last week on his way to his courtroom and 
chambers on the eighth floor of the courthouse 
first i took everything from my pockets and that didnt work 
then i took my teeth out and that didnt work wiseman said 
referring to his dental bridge finally after taking my shoes 
off i made it through 
the judge said a metal arch support in his shoe apparently 
triggered the device he said the incident didnt bother him and 
emphasized the importance of the tighter security 
indeed wiseman and other judges last month ordered that everyone 
entering the sixth seventh and eighth floors of the courthouse pass 
through the metal detector the order even applies to security and 
law enforcement officers who must leave any weapons at a security 
post before entering the area

but officials at a local library deemed their first bug races a 
success 
about 35 preschoolers in the loris branch librarys summer 
reading program were told to bring their own insects to compete in 
the races wednesday 
organizers had planned to put race numbers on the backs of the 
bugs but that idea didnt work out what with the contestants 
squirming so much 
im not too favorable to spiders race organizer and 
childrens service director janet barwick said as she tried to stick 
a number on a tiny black spider brought in a baby food jar by a

holding bugs is not my cup of tea said librarian frances 
prince struggling to label a cricket while bugs hopped merrily 
along the library checkout counter 
pandemonium continued when the youngsters moved outside where 
racing circles were drawn on the parking lot 
oh sick piped up one youngster when he saw that someone had 
accidentally stepped on his cricket and smashed the creature flat

their owners

a nuclear attack submarine used in filming 
the hunt for red october accidentally snagged a tugboat sunk it 
and left one crewman missing 
the search for the night watchman aboard the tugboat barcona was 
suspended and no rescue effort was planned today after the sinking 
10 miles from shore 
the submarine a san diegobased vessel with a crew of 140 
wasnt damaged and it surfaced after the accident to assist in the 
search for the missing sailor the navy said 
brian bellanger who was keeping watch at the time of the 
accident early wednesday was missing wednesday night at the end of 
a search by four us coast guard vessels two helicopters and three 
navy craft said coast guard lt rick button 
there was no immediate word on how the accident occurred and 
officials said both the tug and the sub apparently were in the 
correct sea lanes 
dan rodriguez and mike lynk escaped the tug and were rescued 
unhurt after the 6900ton uss houston snagged the barconas tow 
line said coast guard petty officer 2nd class elizabeth neely 
the two scrambled onto one of two empty barges being towed by the 
barcona owned by long beachbased connellypacific marine 
bellangers brother glenn said the water just caved in the 
boat which just went straight down mike had the wires for the 
microphone the radio all wrapped around his neck he said he 
didnt think brian was going to make it 
were all hoping right now that he did but theres 450 fathoms 
of water out there and thats thats pretty deep 
the sub was used this week in the paramount film production the 
hunt for red october based on the bestselling novel about a 
runaway soviet sub by tom clancy the film stars sean connery and 
sam neill no actors were on the submarine at the time of the 443

sank southwest of long beach officials said parsons said rodriguez 
and lynk the surviving crew members were asleep when the submarine 
struck the tow cable 
the tug was pulled down very rapidly said cmdr don parsons 
who was heading the coast guard investigation everything happened 
so fast it sank in less than a minute 
the survivors didnt get out until the tug was already under 
water the last time anyone saw the missing man was when he was seen 
going down to the engine room

the dollar rose sharply against the japanese yen 
again today triggering stock selling that sent the tokyo stock 
exchanges key index to its largest oneday loss this year 
the dollar closed at 15130 yen up 325 yen from wednesdays 
14805yen close it was the highest since aug 14 1987 when the 
dollar closed at 15240 
the dollar now has gained 1065 yen since june 5 including a 
490yen jump on monday 
it opened today at 15030 yen its low for the day and hit 
15135 yen at one point 
the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 48990 points or 147 
percent this years largest oneday loss and closed at 3291309 
finance minister tatsuo murayama told reporters the dollars 
surge resulted mainly from speculative buying by japanese investors 
he said it had nothing to do with fundamental elements in the us 
and japanese economies 
we must stop the dollars further rise by using every means 
available murayama said expressing concern that the higher 
dollar could bring inflationary pressure in japan 
well take resolute measures under the established system of 
cooperation with other countries he said 
but there is no immediate need to call a meeting of finance 
chiefs of the group of seven leading industrial countries before the 
groups scheduled summit in paris in midjuly murayama said 
the bank of japan reportedly continued to sell dollars in efforts 
to check the us currencys rise although the central bank does 
not comment on its monetary activities 
the boj intervention didnt work at all said a bank of tokyo 
analyst speaking on condition of anonymity everybody was just 
buying as the dollar rose trying to get on the bandwagon 
traders said however there was some dollarselling to take 
profits 
mitsuhiko kinugasa of daiwa bank said no matter how often the 
japanese side says the dollar should stay lower it has small 
influence because the united states doesnt make any moves 
japanese market players have taken this as an indication that the 
united states is allowing the dollars surge for the moment 
he said investors were aggressively buying dollars anticipating 
improved us trade figures for april due to be announced later 
today in washington 
on the stock exchange daiwa securities dealer kenji ishizuka 
said share prices were lower across the board mainly because of the 
dollars surge against the yen 
in addition to the major discouragement due to the yens 
plunge many japanese investors avoided buying while awaiting 
release of the us trade report later tonight he said 
ishizuka said a narrowing of the us trade deficit would promote 
a further rise by the dollar which could further discourage stock 
investment 
some investment trust companies intermittently bought cheaper 
issues for profittaking but it could not stop the indexs fall he 
said 
trading was thin with first section volume estimated at 650 
million shares up from 450 million the previous day

a powerful forensic tool called dna 
fingerprinting is unreliable in some court cases because no 
standards exist for the technique a genetics researcher says 
there is an urgent need for the scientific community to agree 
on clear guidelines for the procedures and standards needed to 
ensure reliable dna fingerprinting said eric lander 
dna fingerprinting is used to determine whether biological 
samples recovered from a crime such as blood or semen came from a 
particular suspect it also is used in paternity cases 
such evidence has been used in more than 80 criminal trials in 
the united states lander said 
the scientist said he did not know how common faulty conclusions 
from dna fingerprinting may be he also had no recommendation on 
whether to ban the evidence from courtrooms until scientists 
establish standards for laboratory procedures and interpretation of 
results 
lander said he is not questioning the inherent usefulness of dna 
fingerprinting which he said offers tremendous potential as a 
forensic tool 
lander of the whitehead institute for biomedical research in 
cambridge mass is writing a report on forensic dna testing for 
the federal office of technology assessment he described his views 
in todays issue of the british journal nature and in a telephone 
interview 
spokesmen for dna fingerprinting laboratories agreed with the 
call for scientific standards but said their labs already take 
steps to ensure accuracy 
we stand behind the results that we obtain said karen wexler 
of lifecodes corp based in valhalla ny 
dna fingerprinting is based on the fact that no two people share 
exactly the same genetic makeup except for identical twins 
to do an analysis microscopic threadlike genetic material 
called dna is cut into segments which then are made to arrange 
themselves into characteristic patterns that resemble bar codes used 
at supermarkets 
the pattern from a blood or semen sample is compared to that of 
dna taken from a suspect if the patterns match the blood or semen 
is considered to have come from the suspect 
that conclusion includes an estimate of the likelihood that 
matching patterns came from different people a chance generally put 
at one in many million 
lander testified for the defense in a recent new york case in 
which a commercial laboratory said a blood stain on the defendants 
watch matched the blood of a slain woman 
but experts for the prosecution and defense later agreed that the 
dna evidence was not reliable enough to support that conclusion 
the laboratory had not used its own announced standard for what 
constitutes a match lander wrote it also used an inappropriate 
procedure for estimating the likelihood that the samples came from 
two different people he said 
in a rape and slaying case lander said a laboratory estimated 
there was only a onein96million chance that samples it matched 
came from different people but the calculation did not take into 
account that the crime occurred in a small inbred texas town 
founded by a handful of families where the restricted genetic 
variation would make it more likely that matching samples could come 
from separate residents lander said 
in another case a laboratory said its analysis showed that a 
woman was the mother of an abandoned baby but the woman later gave 
birth to a baby who had been conceived about one week before the 
first baby was born 
lander said scientific standards should define what constitutes a 
match and how to estimate the chance that matching samples came from 
different people they also should deal with other aspects of 
laboratory procedure and analysis of results he said 
establishing national standards would be very appropriate 
said wexler of lifecodes 
the dna operation recently begun by the fbi probably will serve 
as a model she said 
john huss vice president marketing of cellmark diagnostics in 
germantown md said cellmark subscribes to proficiency testing 
services and spends an awful lot of resources to ensure quality 
control 
cellmark already has called for national standards for dna 
fingerprinting which would keep the schlock out of the field

condemned killer william paul thompson remained 
adamant that he would rather die for killing a reno transient than 
spend any more time on death row 
thompson appeared nervous and wiped away tears during a 10minute 
hearing wednesday before district court judge deborah agosti the 
judge questioned him extensively before ruling that thompson 
understood his options and rejected them intentionally 
do you voluntarily submit to the execution of the death penalty 
at 2 am june 19 agosti asked 
yes maam thompson replied 
when the judge reminded him he could appeal at any time before 
his execution by lethal injection he replied i wont but thank 
you 
deputy washoe county district attorney gary hatlestad added that 
other parties could intervene on his behalf particularly the 
american civil liberties union thompson replied i dont want no 
part of the aclu 
at the conclusion of the hearing thompson struggled with his 
shackles to shake hands with hatlestad and whisper god bless 
you 
aclu representative richard siegel who did not attend the 
hearing said it was unlikely his group would try to intervene in 
the case we probably cannot succeed without some cooperation at 
some stage from the person he said 
assistant us public defender pat flanagan also said he had no 
standing to intervene unless directed by the court or requested by 
thompson 
thompson 52 has spent more than half of his life behind bars 
and was convicted of killing randy waldron in 1984 by shooting him 
four times in the head he subsequently pleaded guilty to the 
murders of two brothers in placer county calif 
his attorney dave mcelhinney said thompson told him in a letter 
late last month that one way or the other he was going to spend 
the rest of his life in prison and he feels enough is enough 
also next week sean patrick flanagan is scheduled to die june 23 
for the las vegas killings of two men he thought were homosexuals 
flanagan also has said he wants no more appeals of his sentence

people came to cheer and jeer oliver 
north and ended up shouting at each other with american flags on 
both sides and police in the middle 
norths final speech before his sentencing next week for three 
irancontra convictions brought out the passion in the crowd outside 
the circle star theater where about 150 protesters traded barbs 
with about 70 supporters 
some called him a criminal others a hero chants of jail ollie 
north competed with ollie ollie 
inside the 45yearold retired marine lieutenant colonel 
insisted his actions were lawful and won hearty applause from a 
crowd that halffilled the 3700seat auditorium wednesday 
he claimed his legal problems stemmed in part from an 
increasingly imperial congress that is preventing the executive 
branch from carrying out foreign policy 
north was found guilty on may 4 of aiding and abetting the 
obstruction of congress by helping prepare a false chronlogy of arms 
sales to iran in 1985 and by destroying documents he also was 
convicted of accepting a 13800 home security system from arms 
dealer richard v secord 
north faces a possible 10year prison term and fines up to 
750000 
the former national security council aide was acquitted of nine 
other charges including allegations that he lied to investigators 
about his involvement in usiran arms sales and providing secret 
aid to the nicaraguan rebels 
north received a standing ovation when he entered the theater and 
was never booed or interrupted by the audience that paid 1750 for 
a ticket he received 25000 for his appearance 
he spoke about the virtues of faithfulness and ideals about god 
family and country he attacked communism warned against trusting 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev too much and condemned the 
butchers in beijing 
the world we live in today looks more to me like 1939 than 
1989 he said comparing gorbachev to adolf hitler 
neville chamberlain and the leaders of europe were swayed 
by the mighty wurlitzer coming out of berlin and my concern is that 
we not be swayed by the mighty wurlitzer in the kremlin north 
said 
north never expressed remorse over his actions in the irancontra 
affair and didnt blame former president reagan or any other 
executive branch officials for his troubles instead he attacked 
congress 
in an increasingly powerful congress we have a system of 
special persecutors uh prosecutors he said pausing to laugh 
with the crowd at what he called a slip of the tongue 
north spoke on schedule at 11 am after police worked through 
the night to remove 21 fake bombs planted in the theater 30 miles 
south of san francisco the devices turned out to be small harmless 
circuit boards available in many electronics shops 
we believe the idea was that these devices wouldnt be found 
until 9 or 10 this morning and wed have to call the show off

a rare baseball card stolen from a 
14yearold boy and estimated to be worth about 100000 has turned 
out to be a fake 
the stolen card originally thought to be a 1910 honus wagner 
tobacco card lacked the tobacco stamp that would have indicated it 
was an original said detective phil white of the contra costa 
county sheriffs department 
rene montoya who still hasnt recovered the card was shown a 
replica on tuesday and identified it as exactly the same card 
stolen from him white said 
up until yesterday we had no way of determining if the card was 
authentic or a replica said white we didnt even know a 
replica existed not being specialists in that field we had nothing 
to compare it with 
the boys grandfather gave him the card six years ago rene put 
it in the family bible for safekeeping after seeing a television 
program that discussed the value of authentic cards and hoped it 
would finance his college education 
his family never had the card appraised but assumed it was one of 
only 10 to 20 authentic wagner cards that experts believe exist 
today 
on may 24 an acquaintance of montoya asked the boy whether he 
could photograph the card and then he grabbed it and fled 
wagner who played shortstop for pittsburgh joined babe ruth and 
ty cobb as one of the first players inducted into the hall of fame 
wagner bought up many of the cards himself because he did not 
approve of youngsters having to buy cigarettes to obtain his picture 
white said the boys family was unaware the card was a replica 
when they reported it stolen 
theyre still upset the card was stolen from the boy but are 
somewhat relieved they hadnt lost so much money white said 
police are still seeking the thief even though its value is 10 
at most

three boats that police said smuggled food 
to the besieged christian sector were blown up in the port of sidon 
today as syrian gunners pounded the christian enclave with hundreds 
of shells and rockets 
two people were killed and nine wounded as 300 howitzer shells 
and rockets rained on the region late wednesday and early today 
police said a sailor was wounded in the sidon explosions 
the casualties raised the overall toll to 372 killed and 1450 
wounded since the latest outbreak in the 14year civil war began on 
march 8 
the shelling hadnt been as ferocious for quite a long time 
said bahjat jaber a reporter in east beirut 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
rules said christian leader michel aouns units did not return the 
fire 
he said the syrians shelled the enclave home to about 1 million 
people from batteries in moslem west beirut and mountains southeast 
of the city 
the attacks coincided with an arab effort to defuse the crisis 
between syria and gen aouns 20000strong force 
lakhdar ibrahimi assistant secretarygeneral of the arab league 
met wednesday night in damascus with syrian foreign minister farouk 
sharaa after talks in beirut with aoun and acting salim hoss a 
sunni moslem who heads a rival moslem government in lebanon 
ibrahimi an algerian was sent to beirut and damascus to mediate 
a settlement in lebanon within six months 
police said the three motor boats exploded simultaneously at dawn 
in sidon 25 miles south of beirut 
the spokesman said the boats had been braving the tight syrian 
blockade to smuggle food into the christian enclave 
sidon is a mainly sunni city the sunnis and shiite moslems have 
stayed out of the latest confrontation only druse fighters have 
been actively fighting alongside the syrians 
the independent daily newspaper annahar said wednesday that the 
threemonth blockade has failed to starve the christians it said 94 
vessels have unloaded about 15017 tons of cargo at the christian 
port of jounieh 12 miles north of beirut 
syria imposed the siege of east beirut and the christian region 
on march 14 six days into the latest round of fighting 
the confrontation was touched off by a blockade aoun ordered on 
militiarun ports south of beirut which have cost the ailing state 
treasury 100 million in customs dues annually 
aoun has agreed to lift his blockade to assist the arab leagues 
peace efforts but the syrians have maintained their siege and 
shelling of christian ports claiming they want to prevent iraqi 
supplies from reaching aoun by sea 
iraq is syrias main arab foe it has openly supported aouns 
pledge to drive the 40000 syrian troops out of lebanon

ireland held parliamentary elections today with 
opposition leaders saying they would try to deny charles haughey a 
fifth term as prime minister if his party does not win a majority of 
seats 
analysts say haughey who has led the country four times with 
minority governments may win his majority this time 
even so the standing of the the man who first became prime 
minister in 1979 and his fianna fail party have slipped in opinion 
polls since haughey announced the new election 
about 24 million people were eligible to vote and counting 
begins friday morning with the first results to be announced that 
afternoon 
lovely morning haughey said after casting his vote in north 
dublin everythings going great 
on the eve of the election however opposition leaders said they 
would not vote for haughey for another maximum fiveyear term as 
prime minister if he fails to win a majority of the 165 seats in the 
dail or parliament 
alan dukes leader of the fine gael party and def omalley 
leader of the progressive democratic party issued statements saying 
they would not vote for haughey should his party fall short of a 
majority 
they also indicated they they would not abstain to permit haughey 
to muster a plurality 
in that case haughey shot back voters have a choice between a 
fianna fail government or no government at all 
omalley called on voters to reject the obsession of mr 
haughey with absolute power 
fianna fail was preferred by 44 percent of those surveyed in the 
final irish independent poll published wednesday the fine 
gaelprogressive democratic coalition combined for 35 percent 
followed by the labor party with 12 percent the marxist workers 
party with 5 percent and others with 4 percent 
haugheys party gained none of the undecided vote from a week 
earlier while fine gael was up 1 percent and the leftist labor 
party was up 2 points 
fianna fail has 80 seats in the dail now and would need 83 to 
control it he might still be able to govern with fewer than 83 but 
would need support from some other group or coalition of groups 
haughey had received support from fine gael for his major 
economic policies which reduced irelands budget deficit to less 
than 5 percent of gross national product from a peak of 15 percent 
the government also cut basic tax rates from 35 to 32 percent 
unemployment remains at 175 percent however and emigration has 
increased since haughey took office in 1987 
the government also aroused deep antagonism in western ireland by 
introducing fishing licenses charging 20 a year for trout fishing 
fianna fail strategists had believed it was a good time to call 
an election with inflation running at 35 percent a year and 
interest rates at only 9 percent 
irelands system allows voters to list their preferences in 
descending order and these are shuffled around in a complex 
tallying system that makes opinion polls unreliable voters second 
choices will likely decide whether haughey gets his majority 
ireland has not had a majority government since jack lynchs 
fianna fail administration left office in 1973 and no government 
has won consecutive terms since the 1960s 
though haughey has served four terms he was defeated between 
each of them and has never won two consecutively

a pediatrician has been charged with murder in 
the suffocation death of her 7weekold daughter 
dr katherine kiyomi shiraki perez 33 surrendered to the 
authorities wednesday night and was charged with the april 13 death 
of sarah perez 
judge thomas nurre freed her on a 24000 property bond and set 
an arraignment for friday 
mrs perez and her husband dr ricardo victor perez said they 
found the infant dead in their suburban home the infant was born 
feb 22 
seth tieger an assistant hamilton county prosecutor said an 
autopsy led to an investigation that resulted in the indictment by a 
hamilton county grand jury he declined to give details 
the husband was not involved in the case tieger said 
mrs perez has a private practice in nearby fort thomas ky 
the kansas city mo native has a degree from the university of 
hawaii and is licensed to practice in ohio and kentucky 
david carby general consul for the kentucky board of medical 
licensure said the board would investigate the case 
lauren lubow spokeswoman for the ohio state medical board said 
mrs perez had not been the subject of any formal disciplinary 
actions since she was licensed to practice in ohio in july 1985 ms 
lubow would not say whether mrs perez had been the subject of any 
complaints 
mrs perez could have her medical license suspended although an 
indictment doesnt automatically lead to suspension ms lubow said 
im not sure that this would be enough for a summary 
suspension ms lubow said she said that determination would be 
left to the medical board 
a 1987 state law allows the state medical board to automatically 
suspend the licenses of physicians who are found guilty or plead 
guilty to any of 10 crimes including murder ms lubow said

some chinese students in the united states 
are trying to tie up chinese government telephone lines set up for 
informants in hopes of blocking beijing residents from turning in 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
the students are paying for the calls with their own money and 
with funds raised in recent weeks to support the prodemocracy 
movement which the chinese government is trying to crush 
one stanford university student who requested that his name not 
be used said he called a beijing hot line and spoke with an 
operator for 20 minutes 
i called and made up a lie about someone i wanted to report 
last night the student said wednesday we talked for about 10 
minutes then i told her it was a white lie and we talked for 
another 10 minutes 
i told her that there were 3000 people killed by soldiers 
that i had seen pictures and knew this from the bbc cbs the new 
york times and other newspapers the student continued 
she said if i were chinese i would have a conscience and 
believe my own government i said if she were a real chinese she 
would have a conscience and not report to the government on the 
students 
he said the operator paused then hung up 
a nationwide computer bulletin board used by chinese university 
students in this country lists about a dozen beijing hot lines that 
residents of the capital are supposed to use to report the 
whereabouts of known dissidents 
the bulletin board also contains numerous suggestions on how to 
jam the lines thereby keeping informants from being able to use 
them 
some people have proposed that everyone call collect or to 
call and let it ring then hang up said liu dianding a graduate 
student who has read the electronic mail at stanford university 
students across the united states reportedly have raised tens of 
thousands of dollars in recent weeks to help support their countrys 
prodemocracy movement stanford students say they have raised about 
100000 
the students say they dont know if their calls are having much 
impact but they remain determined 
if we change peoples minds little by little then one billion 
people will know the truth said liu

18 years in prison circuit judge h calvin spain on wednesday gave 
him 15 years 
trial marriages and livein relationships can lead to bad 
consequences spain said and this is a prime example 
owens will be eligible for parole in 2 years six months earlier 
than if the judge had imposed the full sentence 
the sentence reduction was unusual but within the judges 
authority said assistant commonwealths attorney kathleen m edge 
the commonwealth obviously would have preferred the full jury 
verdict she said 
defense attorney g roger schafer had argued that owens was 
provoked into beating his 30yearold girlfriend when she told him 
that she had slept with another man 
they lived together for eight months with no prior violent 
incidents schafer said he had no history of violence and no 
prior criminal record then one night he just lost control but it 
was provoked 
the woman testified owens beat her forced her into a bedroom and 
sodomized and raped her she said he held her captive two days 
raping her until she escaped from the condominium they shared 
owens a car salesman admitted beating the woman but said she

franco as saying he was not shown any order barring reporters from 
the area the report also quoted abc officials as saying troops 
showed a closure order to another tv crew but that it was 10 days

the army official said the crew had arrived at the scene of a 
skirmish between soldiers and about 50 palestinian youths

a court accused three people today of starting a 
riot in shanghai and sentenced them to death the first execution 
orders since the government began crushing the prodemocracy 
movement 
in another display of the widening crackdown on dissidents state 
television in beijing showed reputed protest leaders being packed 
into police vans their heads shaved and signs dangling from their 
necks describing their alleged crimes 
governmentcontrolled media reported numerous arrests in other 
cities 
the death sentences in shanghai were the first announced since 
chinese troops opened fire on prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing 
on june 34 crushing a 7weekold reform movement 
the hardline government since has reported arresting more than 
1000 people in a nationwide crackdown in which the student protest 
leaders have been branded as counterrevolutionaries and instigators 
of the turmoil 
television said the three men sentenced to death were charged 
with setting a train on fire and beating security officials who 
tried to extinguish the blaze national television showed the three 
men in a courtroom being sentenced 
the court also accused them of instigating a riot unprecedented 
in recent shanghai history the men who appeared to be workers 
were identified as xu guoming dian hanwu and yan xierong 
the train incident occurred june 6 when six protesters were 
killed as they stood at a barricade on the tracks near the shanghai 
train station and a train from beijing did not stop in time 
people in a large crowd set fire to the train and fought with 
firemen and police who came to put it out injuring 21 
in beijing the noon news showed 26 workers their heads shaven 
being led by armed police onto a stage before a packed hall in the 
northeastern city of changchun 
several had large placards around their necks giving their names 
and accusing them of instigating social unrest and spreading rumors 
the signs said they had been sentenced to labor reform a type of 
prison 
the placards are a throwback to the 196676 cultural revolution 
when leftist red guards paraded their victims through city streets 
wearing dunce caps and signs on their chests 
beijing television today also showed young people being jammed 
into a police bus in the southern city of guiyang and said six 
people were arrested in central chinas wuhan it also broadcast the 
arrest of chen xuedong a physics major at nanjing university and 
showed tapes of him leading mass demonstrations in the eastern 
chinese city 
the government kept up its propaganda campaign portraying 
soldiers who put down the prodemocracy movement as heroes the 
reports deny troops opened fire on unarmed people as they moved 
protesters out of beijings tiananmen square 
chinese witnesses and western intelligence estimates say up to 
3000 died were killed in the assault most of them civilians the 
government contends about 200 people died half of them soldiers 
the communist partys newspaper the peoples daily ran a 
frontpage editorial today to drum up support for the government 
urging chinese to unite and join forces to fight the common enemy 
a great victory already has been achieved in quelling the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion in beijing and the whole country 
the situation is moving toward stability but the struggle 
definitely is not over 
the editorial also said it was important to strengthen 
education of the many people who are not clear about the true 
situation and who took to the streets to march in support of the 
prodemocracy movement 
today television read a letter from six unidentified beijing 
university students who said they took part in a weeklong hunger 
strike during protesters threeweek occupation of tiananmen square 
the students were quoted as saying they now regret their actions 
which stirred up popular sympathies for their movement for a freer 
china 
the government on wednesday ordered the expulsion of two us 
correspondents john pomfret of the associated press and voice of 
americas bureau chief in beijing alan pessin 
the two accused of violating martial law regulations that ban 
foreign reporting on the prodemocracy movement in beijing were 
given 72 hours to leave the country 
official media have launched daily diatribes against the us 
governments voa service which enjoys wide popularity among chinese 
seeking information beyond what the tightly controlled chinese press 
offers 
pomfret was accused of having contacts with leaders of the 
protest movement and of obtaining unspecified state secrets 
pessin said the government accused him of fomenting unrest with 
his reports both men denied the charges 
on beijings tananmen square site of the bloody denouement of 
the student movement and the symbolic heart of china workmen 
planted shrubs around a monument to revolutionary heroes 
dozens of tanks that had been sent in the square had disappeared 
by wednesday and 20 remaining armored personnel carriers were 
covered with tarps key intersections that had been guarded by 
soldiers with rifles were unguarded 
officials said today that two months of demonstrations and 
martial law imposed may 20 had cost the city 270 million in 
economic losses twothirds from delays in deliveries of raw 
materials and worker slowdowns

the bush administration is reacting cautiously 
to chinas order that two us reporters leave the country in the 
hope that a series of retaliatory expulsions might be avoided 
undersecretary of state robert kimmit met for 45 minutes 
wednesday afternoon with chinese ambassador hun xu who was called 
to the state department to receive a us protest on the expulsion 
orders 
the chinese government has accused associated press reporter john 
pomfret and voice of america bureau chief alan pessin of violating 
martial law restrictions on wednesday they were given 72 hours to 
leave the country 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater rejected chinese 
accusations that the reporters were distorting fact spreading 
rumors and instigating turmoil 
to the contrary we believe these journalists were trying to 
print the truth of the situation in china fitzwater said 
the administration said it did not plan any retaliatory action 
against the 38 chinese journalists based in washington and new york 
a state department official asked why no such step was planned 
said the administration did not want to get into a titfortat 
situation 
it would be a losing proposition to do that said the 
official we have far more journalists there than they have here 
and its in our interest to have them there 
fitzwater while expressing grave concern over the 
expulsions said that act as well as chinese attempts to jam voa 
broadcasts will not succeed in keeping the truth about what is 
going on in china from being heard in that troubled land or 
throughout the world 
fitzwater praised the work done by journalists who have covered 
the unrest in china and the bloody crackdown of the prodemocracy 
movement 
the journalists and news organizations in china have performed 
with distinction and valor in many cases with personal courage 
to bring the dimensions of the tragic violence there to the peoples 
of the world fitzwater said 
there were these other reactions 
in new york louis d boccardi president and general manager of 
the associated press said the ap had protested in the strongest 
terms to the chinese government this unwarranted assault on fair and 
factual reporting 
john pomfret is a journalist not a participant and even those 
who have issued this order must surely understand that he said 
voa director richard carlson told reporters that the expulsions 
were a step backward for the media in china which over the past 
couple of years have demonstrated some steps forward 
he added we think its very unfortunate and sad in fact for 
the chinese people who in the tens of millions depend on the voice 
of america and the bbc and some other outside broadcasters for what 
has been extremely reliable straightforward factual unbiased 
accounts of the turmoil in their country 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said it 
was us officials understanding that pomfret and pessin werent 
doing anything unusual or out of the ordinary they were simply 
doing their jobs 
on capitol hill meanwhile 67 senators called on the chinese 
government to free student leaders jailed for their roles in the 
prodemocracy demonstrations 
we urge the immediate release of all those who were peacefully 
demonstrating for democracy the senators said in a telegram to 
chinese prime minister li peng 
among the signers were majority leader george mitchell of maine 
republican leader bob dole of kansas sen alan cranston dcalif 
sen alan dixon dill sen claiborne pell dri chairman of

imelda marcos says it was outrageous that us 
marshals served a summons on her critically ill husband at the 
hospital 
the summons is based on the civil suit filed by the government in 
connection with a criminal case brought against ferdinand marcos and 
his wife last fall 
the civil and criminal complaints accuse the marcoses of looting 
over 100 million from the philippines and using it to buy real 
estate and other assets in the united states 
deputy us marshal james propotnick on wednesday said marshals 
served the summons on the former philippine president on monday by 
leaving copies with an aide outside marcos room at st francis 
medical center 
mrs marcos was served by posting the documents on the gate of 
the marcos home after the people there refused to accept the papers 
propotnick said 
this is outrageous what are they trying to do to ferdinand 
kill him mrs marcos said in a statement this is a great 
shame 
marcos attorney richard hibey called the serving of the summons 
barbaric he said he expects to challenge the legality of 
serving a summons on a man who is near death and unable to

people in britain ireland denmark the 
netherlands and spain voted today in european parliament elections 
following campaigns dominated by national rather than european 
issues 
in the other european economic community members belgium 
france greece italy luxembourg portugal and west germany 
voting for the 518member assembly takes place sunday 
results in todays elections will not be announced until voting 
has ended in the other eec or common market countries sunday 
night the parliaments limited powers include approving trade 
agreements involving eec members 
throughout the common market 7126 candidates are vying for 
seats in the 518member assembly representing 178 national parties 
opinion polls predicted the socialists with 166 seats and the 
christian democrats with 112 seats would strenghten their 
positions in the elections green parties which favor environmental 
causes also were expected to win more than the 20 seats they now 
hold these gains would be at the expense of conservatives and the 
assemblys 16 extreme rightists 
in ireland as in luxembourg and greece on sunday voting for 
the european parliament coincides with national elections 
in these nations the campaigns focused on national issues such 
as unemployment and immigration rather than european issues such 
as the plan to remove the eecs internal borders and create a single 
market eec by 1992 
yet that was also evident in nations where no national elections 
are immediately in the offing 
in the netherlands for example the campaign was overshadowed by 
issues facing dutch voters in the sept 6 national elections the 
amsterdam daily trouw called voting for the 25 dutch assembly seats 
a dull event

prime minister rajiv gandhi says the 
45000 indian troops in sri lanka will not withdraw immediately 
despite a sri lankan request to pull out by july 31 newspapers 
reported today 
gandhi told reporters wednesday that a withdrawal depended upon 
full implementation of the july 1987 peace accord that sought 
with promises of limited autonomy to end an insurgency by sri 
lankas ethnic tamil minority 
last week president ranasinghe premadasa of sri lanka sent an 
envoy to new delhi to request an indian withdrawal by the end of 
july 
india has said in official statements that premadasas deadline 
was impossible to meet but wednesday was the first time gandhi made 
a statement in public 
we are joint guarantors to the agreement with sri lanka until 
the agreement is implemented in full we will have a responsibility 
towards the security of tamils in sri lanka the times of india 
quoted gandhi as saying in the southern city of bangalore 
we are willing to sit down and work out a process of 
withdrawal the prime minister added according to the newspaper 
sri lankas foreign ministry said today that a mere request by 
sri lanka for indian troops to leave should be the only provision 
for a pullout 
it is regretted certain statements have been made both here and 
abroad to support the continued presence of the indian troops in sri 
lanka the ministry said in a communique such pronouncements 
will only have the unfortunate effect of confirming the fears in the 
minds of the people of sri lanka the indian troops have come to this 
country to remain and not to return 
the 1987 peace accord extended limited administrative powers to 
the tamil minority in the countrys northeast in return for a 
surrender of arms the tamils were not a party to the agreement 
however and the largest tamil guerrilla group has kept fighting 
several tamil citizens groups have asked india to remain until 
provincial councils with tamil representatives take office 
in the past two years up to 70000 soldiers have been deployed 
in sri lanka in an effort to try to end the tamil insurrection and 
to oversee the peace accord signed with premadasas predecessor 
junius r jayewardene 
more than 700 indian troops have been killed and about 45000 
remain in the island nation off indias southern coast 
many ultranationalist members of the majority sinhalese and 
several government ministers resent the presence of the indian 
troops 
premadasa who like jayewardene is sinhalese took office in 
january pledging to bring about an early indian withdrawal 
tamil extremists started their separatist struggle in 1983 the 
tamils who comprise 18 percent of the countrys 16 million people 
claim discrimination by the sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the 
population 
more than 9000 people have been killed in the tamil insurrection 
and at least 3500 others have died in the sinhalese backlash 
ultranationalist sinhalese say too many concessions are being given 
to tamils 
india was drawn into the internal strife of its small neighbor 
through its role as the regional power and the sympathies of its 60 
million tamils

of socialist reform and said the sentence was illegal 
soviet forces crushed hungarys popular uprising in 1956 and 
czechoslovakias reform movement of 1968 but unlike other east bloc 
countries such as hungary and poland czechoslovakia has not taken 
the soviet unions lead and adopted social political and economic 
reform 
it is natural that the present reform forces have found a 
symbol in nagy but we should not forget that his legacy as an 
exponent of hungarian revolutionary movement with emphasis on 
martyrdom is a target of appropriation by enemies of socialism 
the slovak communist party daily pravda 
the newspaper characterized nagy as contradictory but said 
there is no doubt that everything he did he did with the best of 
intentions especially in his effort to stop bloodshed 
the hungarian supreme court is to review his case on july 6

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
said today that moscow regretted some aspects of the conflict in 
china and that the failure of reforms there could pose dangers to 
the world 
speaking at a news conference on the final day of his fourday 
trip to west germany gorbachev also praised some of the students 
who took part in the prodemocracy movement that was recently 
crushed by chinas hardline government 
gorbachevs comments were his most extensive yet on the crisis in 
china and the governments violent suppression of the prodemocracy 
movement 
the movement gained strength during the week of may 15 when 
gorbachev began his historic visit to china ending a threedecade 
rift between the two communist powers up to 1 million people 
rallied in the streets of beijing demanding social reforms almost 
overshadowing gorbachevs visit 
at todays news conference gorbachev was asked whether he shared 
the official chinese view that the students were 
counterrevolutionaries 
the soviet leader sidestepped a direct reply recalling that he 
had said during his visit to beijing that negotiations were the 
solution to resolving problems 
i think all of us are very much concerned at what is happening 
in china he said all of us want the process of deep reform not 
to fail in such a large nation 
that failure would be very dangerous for the entire process of 
creating a healthy environment in the world gorbachev added 
all of us want the people and the government of china to find a 
way out which corresponds to the interests of the chinese people and 
common aspirations gorbachev said 
he said this concern dictated the soviets balanced serious 
position on china although this did not exclude that we regret 
some aspects of what happened 
gorbachev and the soviets have been cautious in speaking about 
the events in china apparently anxious not to undo the results of 
the sinosoviet summit that sealed the mending of relations after a 
30year rift 
gorbachev mentioned that he had received letters from 
unidentified students in which they had spoken out in favor of 
reform bilateral cooperation and many other policies that he said 
were broadly similar to those of the chinese communist party 
i cannot suspect these people of any evil intention he added 
but he said there could be elements in the protest movement 
that took advantage of the situation gorbachev did not 
elaborate 
the chinese government in an elaborate propaganda campaign in 
staterun media has portrayed protest leaders as thugs and 
criminals and branded soldiers who occupied beijing on june 34 as 
heroes 
chinese witnesses and western intelligence sources say the 
military raid in beijing killed 3000 people most of them citizens 
the chinese government says 200 people died half of them soldiers

committee was turned over to the leader of the nasserite 
militia mustafa saad a sunni moslem saads militia controls 
sidon 25 miles south of beirut 
he is wearing spectacles and has a bushy beard hes having a 
meeting with saad right now said saads aide who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
saads aide said belgian foreign trade minister robert urbain 
his chief aide robert willermain and belgian charge daffaires 
were at saads residence when cools arrived urbain and willermain 
had driven from damascus syria earlier in the day apparently 
after hearing about a statement from the kidnappers that cools 
release was imminent 
all of them are meeting with saad theyll leave later 
probably for damascus he said 
cools was kidnapped on may 21 1988 near the palestinian refugee 
camp of rashidiyeh where he worked on the outskirts of the 
southern port of tyre 
a group calling itself soldiers of justice claimed reponsibility 
and accused cools of spying for israel 
cools parents visited sidon last month on the anniversary of his 
abduction to appeal for his release 
the soldiers of justice in a typewritten statement delivered to 
a western news agency said wednesday that it would free cools as a 
gesture of good will and cited an appeal from libyan leader col 
moammar gadhafi 
it also said the decision resulted from negotiations undertaken 
by fatahrevolutionary council the radical palestinian guerrilla 
faction headed by terrorist mastermind abu nidal 
there has been widespread speculation in lebanon that cools was 
abducted by abu nidals group despite its public disclaimers many 
analysts believe soldiers of justice is one of many names used by 
the group 
there are now 14 foreigners including nine americans missing 
and believed held hostage in lebanon 
the longest held is american journalist terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped 
march 16 1985 
most of the hostages are believed held by proiranian shiite 
moslem extremist factions 
in a statement released on wednesday the fatahrevolutionary 
council praised the soldiers of justice for deciding to release 
cools 
it also pledged to spare no effort to help release other kidnap 
victims hoping european nations will help curb the israeli 
suppression of our palestinian peoples uprising in the occupied 
territories 
nidal formed the council in 1976 after splitting a few years 
earlier from yasser arafats mainstream palestine liberation 
organization

authorities have arrested hundreds of people in 
uzbekistan in an attempt to halt ethnic violence that has killed at 
least 90 people in the southern republic soviet officials said 
lt gen a anikiev an interior ministry officer said troops 
were guarding intersections and government buildings and patrolling 
streets in fergana the city hit hardest by the 10 days of rioting 
pravda reported 
violence by the native uzbeks has been directed against meshki 
turks an ethnic minority forcibly moved from soviet georgia to 
uzbekistan in 1944 by soviet dictator josef stalin 
the communist party newspaper said helicopters were patrolling 
the tense city and a 10 pmto6 am curfew that was imposed june 
4 remains in effect 
but the situation continues to be serious as an unknown hand 
directs bandits to generate tension pravda quoted anikiev as 
saying 
he added that the situation in fergana 1500 miles southeast of 
moscow is completely under control the newspaper said 
the official news agency tass later said police had received 
repots of further disturbances today it said a wagon with 
childrens clothing that had been collected for fleeing turkish 
refugees was burned in fergana 
tass said more than 15000 turks had been evacuated by wednesday 
turks have been sent to refugee centers in soviet russia 
anikiev said prosecutors from throughout the country including 
kgb and interior ministry investigators had converged on fergana 
kokand and the republics capital tashkent to investigate how the 
unrest began 
several hundred people have been arrested on charges of 
organizing pogroms murder and violence he said along with 
ensuring public order law enforcement personnel are stopping all 
manner of provocative rumors and explaining the situation to people 
to prevent panic 
proceedings have begun in more than 60 criminal cases the 
newspaper said 
premier nikolai i ryzkhov who led a kremlin delegation to the 
region this week said on wednesday that communist party and 
government officials tarnished the partys prestige by giving 
gasoline transportation and vodka to attackers who killed meshki 
turks 
ryzhkov made the disclosure at a meeting with party officials in 
andizhan a regional center northeast of the fergana valley and the 
heart of the violence 
in a report on the session the official news agency tass said 
the involvement of some party and government officials in pogroms 
has become known 
ryzhkov said murderers and attackers would be punished but that 
communist officials involved bore a special responsiblity 
official newspapers say the meshki minority is angry about the 
slow response of troops when the violence broke out and their 
failure to use weapons against marauders who attacked with 
pitchforks knives and hunting weapons 
anikiev said troops were not authorized to use weapons on the 
first day of violence newspaper reports earlier this week suggested 
that officials wanted to avoid a repeat of the clashes between 
troops and proindependence protesters in the georgian capital 
tblisi on april 9 when 20 demonstrators died 
unlike demonstrators in georgia however soviet news reports 
have indicated uzbek rioters were armed 
the interior ministry official also suggested that any delay in 
deployment of troops was due to vague information and indecision on 
the part of the republics leadership 
more than 12000 troops had been sent to the region to contain 
the violence soviet news reports have said that hundreds of homes 
were burned in premeditated attacks on the turkish minority 
ryzhkov said on tuesday that a government commission will examine 
the meshki turks request to return to georgia

president miguel de la madrid and interior secretary fernando 
gutierrez barrios testify before a parliamentary committee on their 
possible knowledge of details surrounding killing said the 
excelsior news service 
the oppositions proposal was rejected by members of the 
governing institutional revolutionary party the news agency said 
the business daily el financiero on wednesday quoted testimony of 
those interviewed in the investigation that led to zorrillas arrest 
as indicating he feared buendia would publicize his alleged links to 
drug kingpin rafael caro quintero 
caro quintero is awaiting trial in the 1985 torturemurder of a 
us drug agent enrique camarena salazar 
excelsior also quoting case testimony said witnesses told 
investigators zorrilla was linked to miguel felix gallardo and 
ernesto fonseca carrillo both recently jailed for operating huge 
drug smuggling operations 
the testimony quoted by excelsior also said zorrilla had 
illegally provided police credentials to 16 drug traffickers to help 
them in their operations 
im innocent i need your help im not guilty excelsior 
quoted zorrilla as saying as he was processed at the northern 
penitentiary on wednesday night 
zorrilla 47 was scheduled to be arraigned today 
he surrendered to authorities tuesday night after a brief 
shootout in a mexico city neighborhood no one was hurt 
he was questioned for 18 hours after his arrest by the deputy

sen alan cranston today said the bush 
administration is refusing to respond to the senates request for 
documents relating to the role of ambassadorial nominee donald gregg 
in the irancontra affair 
weve been stonewalled by the administration cranston 
dcalif said as a senate foreign relations committee confirmation 
hearing resumed into greggs nomination to be ambassador to south 
korea 
cranston said the national security agency has rejected our 
legitimate inquiries out of hand the cia proposed a document 
review arrangement requiring the presence of four republican and 
democratic senators prompting cranston to call the restrictions so 
severe as to be laughable cranston also said the pentagon had 
given unsatisfactory responses and the state department had been 
utterly nonresponsive 
they answered our letter after their own selfimposed deadline 
and failed to produce specific documents we requested and which we 
know exist said cranston 
cranston said the senate committee has been stonewalled by 
oliver north too the former white house aide oversaw the secret 
contra resupply operation from 1984 to 1986 
cranston said north hasnt complied with a committee subpoena for 
uncensored versions of his notebooks the uncensored notebooks 
contain repeated january 1985 references to felix rodriguez which 
suggest norths involvement in rodriguez briefings of the vice 
president said cranston 
rodriguez is a longtime friend of gregg who was sent to el 
salvador with greggs help in 1984 gregg contends he didnt find 
out about norths secret resupply operation until august 1986 and 
didnt learn the extent of norths involvement and didnt tell his 
boss thenvice president george bush until four months later at 
the time gregg was bushs national security adviser 
cranston chairman of the foreign relations subcommittee on east 
asian and pacific affairs promised a committee vote on the gregg 
nomination next tuesday cranston has led the opposition to greggs 
appointment 
democrats on the senate foreign relations committee are trying to 
find out what gregg knew about norths secret contra supply network 
the committee has been zeroing in on greggs ties to rodriguez 
and greggs activities after a contra supply plane was shot down 
over nicaragua in october 1986 that is when the operation started 
to come unraveled 
gregg insisted in testimony today that he first heard details of 
the resupply operation in august 1986 from rodriguez but did not 
know the extent of norths involvement until four months later 
gregg says he didnt inform bush about the network until december 
1986 after the irancontra scandal emerged 
if he had known in august 1986 about the network i would have 
informed the vice president and i would have taken steps to stop 
the operation gregg testified the network operated during a 
congressional ban on military aid to the nicaraguan rebels 
at a may hearing gregg said bush first found out that gregg had 
information on norths operation and rodriguez involvement in it 
through a newspaper interview given by gregg in december 1986 
after talking with gregg late in 1984 rodriguez was sent to el 
salvador to help that country in the battle against leftist 
guerrillas 
north recruited rodriguez to work in the contra rebel resupply 
operation the contras backed by the united states since 1981 have 
been fighting to overthrow the leftist sandinista government in 
nicaragua 
at his recently completed trial north testified that he thought 
he spoke to gregg about the resupply operation but north gave no 
specifics

a deeply divided supreme court today gave some 
legal help to any man trying to prove he fathered the child of a 
woman married to someone else 
by a 54 vote the justices said states must give such men a 
fair opportunity to prove paternity and seek visitation rights 
but the court upheld california rulings that denied visitation 
rights to a man identified only as michael h who says he is the 
father of a 7yearold girl victoria born to a woman identified as 
carol d at a time when carol d was married to another man 
at issue was the constitutionality of a california law similar 
to laws in many other states that creates a presumption of 
paternity in favor of a womans husband if a child is conceived and 
born during their marriage 
four high court members said men in similar circumstances to 
michael h have no constitutional right to a hearing where 
visitation rights could be won 
four justices voted to strike down the california law saying it 
infringed on michael hs constitutionally protected liberty 
the key 9th vote was cast by justice john paul stevens who voted 
to uphold the law but said michael h had been given a fair 
opportunity to show that he is victorias natural father that he 
had developed a relationship with her and that her interests would 
be served by granting him visitation rights 
stevens saying he was willing to assume that michael h and 
others in similar circumstances have a right to a judicial hearing 
to establish paternity said the california law does not violate the 
right because michael h received a chance to prove paternity and 
get visitation rights 
because i am convinced that the trial judge had the authority 
under state law both to hear michaels plea for visitation rights 
and to grant him such rights if victorias best interests so 
warranted i am satisfied that the california statutory scheme is 
constitutional stevens said 
michael h filed in a state court in los angeles a reverse 
paternity lawsuit in 1982 seeking to have himself declared 
victorias father his lawsuit was dismissed 
in upholding the dismissal a state appeals court said the state 
law presumption of fatherhood in carol ds husband identified in 
court records as gerald d was based upon a determination by the 
legislature as a matter of overriding social policy that the 
husband is to be held responsible for the child and the integrity of 
the family unit should not be impugned 
michael h said he had enjoyed a fatherchild relationship with 
victoria and that blood tests show a betterthan98percentchance 
that victoria is his biological daughter 
michael hs appeal said that victoria was born as a result of an 
affair carol d had while she was married to gerald d 
the appeal also said that carol d and victoria moved to the 
virgin islands to live with michael h for several months in 1982 
after she and her husband were estranged 
court records indicate that carol and gerald d later resumed 
living together 
justice antonin scalia joined by chief justice william h 
rehnquist and justices sandra day oconnor and anthony m kennedy 
wrote that michael h had no constitutional right to a judicial 
hearing to establish paternity 
justices william j brennan byron r white thurgood marshall 
and harry a blackmun said he did have such a constitutional right 
the case is michael h vs gerald d 87746

early in former rep pat swindalls perjury trial 
jurors heard him in taperecorded conversations with an undercover 
agent 
thats all theyre going to hear from him 
swindalls lawyers rested their case wednesday without putting 
the former congressman on the stand 
the case is expected to go to the jury friday following closing 
arguments 
because he wont be taking the stand swindall will not face 
crossexamination by prosecutor craig gillen who questioned 
swindall for hours on feb 2 1988 before a federal grand jury 
about an 850000 loan deal 
prosecutors said that among other things swindall lied during 
his testimony that day when he denied being told by an agent posing 
as a money launderer that some of the loan money might have come 
from drug trafficking 
swindall 38 faces up to 45 years in prison the twoterm 
republican from the atlanta suburbs lost his congressional seat to 
democrat ben jones in november 
the indictment specifies 23 alleged lies grouped into nine 
counts of perjury fourteen other alleged lies were dismissed by 
us district judge richard c freeman or dropped by the prosecution 
for reasons of clarity 
the prosecution won a victory today when the judge said he will 
tell the jury that only one deliberate lie is sufficient for a 
conviction on any one count 
he also said he will instruct the jury that swindalls failure to 
testify on his own behalf should not be considered in jury 
deliberations 
the trial was nearly aborted wednesday after gillen asked a 
defense witness lawyer bobby lee cook about what motivates 
defendants to testify 
gillen asked whether it was correct that if a defendant were to 
testify and he knew certain things could help him he would 
be more prone to testify in that regard 
swindall attorney tom thrash immediately asked freeman to declare 
a mistrial arguing that the question planted in the jurors minds 
the thought that if swindall did not testify it would be because he 
had something to hide 
freeman denied the mistrial motion and instructed the jury that 
swindalls failure to testify which is his right should not be 
held against him in any way

several thousand bush attended a briefing where he fielded 
questions from several students completing their training 
border patrol agent david rivera of el paso texas asked for 
some words of wisdom as we enter the field 
a word of wisdom would be in spite of the suspicion or 
circumstantial evidence an individual should be treated with 
respect and given his rights or her rights even though the evidence 
looks overwhelming he said 
i think weve got to stand for that i know that sometimes is 
difficult along the border when you have repeat offenders and you 
have people that are brutally using this narcotics money for 
personal gain and devastating communities 
at the ceremonies bush signed a document transmitting to congress 
a the 12 billion take back the streets anticrime package he 
unveiled a month ago 
he told the officers he could have signed the transmittal in 
washington with a quick flourish of the pen and dispatched an 
aide on a 10minute car ride to capitol hill 
but when it comes to fighting crime you deserve more than 
business as usual he said that is why i have come almost a 
thousand miles to the center to let you know we intend to back you 
where it counts on the streets and in the courtroom 
he said the center was training domestic freedom fighters in 
the war on crime 
bush spelled out anew three of the central planks of his 
anticrime platform doubling to 10 years the mandatory term for use 
of semiautomatic weapons in crimes involving violence or drugs 
eliminating plea bargaining for violent federal firearms offenses 
and an expanded federal death penalty for killers and terrorists 
when a criminal commits a crime with a gun and someone dies 
justice demands something in return the ultimate penalty death 
the president said 
i call on governors to match this federal initiative and 
propose these same three standards at home mandatory time no deals 
without cooperation and the death penalty he said 
lets put the handcuffs on criminals not on the criminal 
justice system he said in short i am proposing more law 
enforcers to catch criminals more staff to prosecute them and more 
prisons to keep them off the streets 
of the 12 billion package 1 billion would be spent on 
building more federal prison space the prison system designed for 
30951 inmates now houses 48000 the rest of the money would be 
used to hire 825 new federal agents and 1600 new prosecutors 
some congressional democrats have complained that bush wasnt 
being tough enough especially on semiautomatic weapons where he 
has suspended imports of foreignmade models but not sales of 
domestic arms 
his proposals also would double to 10 years the mimimum sentence 
for using a semiautomatic weapon in a crime and ban semiautomatic 
weapons clips of more than 15 rounds 
administration officials counter that the president crafted a 
package that could get through the congress which under pressure 
from the gun lobby is always wary of imposing new restrictions on 
firearms 
bush also will outline his plan to a gathering of the 93 us 
attorneys at the white house on friday 
the presidents halfday trip to georgia was his second journey 
outside washington this week he returned to the capital tuesday 
evening from a twoday swing through montana wyoming and nebraska 
on behalf of his clear air initiative 
bush is taking three outoftown trips next week to 
philadelphia on monday richmond va on wednesday and new york on 
thursday for various speeches and events

anonymity identified the tanker as the 231439ton seiva and said

dubai a major southern gulf port when the blast occurred about 4 
pm the executives said 
they said there were deaths and injuries among crewmen working in 
the pump room at the time but no details were available on the 
casualties or how many people were aboard the vessel 
a barricade has been thrown around the area where the tanker 
was anchored and we are unable to get close for details said one 
executive

the supreme court today gave states and state 
officials sweeping new protection from federal lawsuits accusing 
them of civil rights violations 
in a 54 ruling in a case from michigan the court said they may 
not be sued under an 1871 law that authorizes damages against 
persons who violate peoples civil liberties 
states and state officials are not persons as defined by the 
postcivil war law said justice byron r white for the court 
by contrast the court previously has held that a city is a 
person under the law and municipalities and their officials may be 
sued 
but white said today states and their officials enjoy 
constitutional immunity that does not extend to cities he relied on 
the 11th amendment which gives states broad legal protection 
obviously state officials literally are persons white said 
but a suit against a state offficial in his or her official 
capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit 
against the officials office 
justice william j brennan in a dissenting opinion said the 
court is giving a hypertechnical interpretation to a federal law 
while ignoring its larger purpose 
the congress that passed the 1871 statute was fighting to save 
the union and in doing so it transformed our federal system 
brennan said it is difficult therefore to believe that this 
same congress did not intend to include states among those who might 
be liable under the 1871 law for the very deprivations that were 
threatening this nation at that time 
brennan was joined by justices thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens 
white was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
the court today refused to revive a suit accusing michigan 
officials of denying a promotion to a state employee because his 
brother was a political activist 
the employee ray will sought promotion to a job as data systems 
analyst with the state police in 1973 he had been ranked second on 
a promotion list and moved up to number one when the applicant above 
him withdrew from consideration 
but will said he learned years later that he did not get the job 
because a socalled red squad operated by the state police had 
investigated his brother charles a student political activist 
the red squad which monitored campus radicals with subversive 
ideas was held unconstitutional by a state judge in 1976 
ray will then filed suit in state court under the 1871 federal 
law the suit named the state police and its director as defendants 
a state judge in 1982 ruled that wills rights were violated and 
awarded him more than 153000 for lost wages emotional distress 
and as punitive damages 
but the michigan supreme court overuled the judge in 1987 and 
threw out the suit 
the case is will vs michigan department of state police 871207

president bush says republican chairman lee 
atwater is doing a great job despite a widely condemned gop 
memo that likened house speaker thomas s foleys voting record to 
that of a homosexual congressman 
bushs praise at the opening of a twoday republican national 
committee meeting came as a prominent gop campaign official said 
i was guilty of being inarticulate in comments on atwaters role 
in the memo 
ed rollins chairman of the gop congressional campaign commitee 
said he did not intend to question atwaters earlier statements 
disavowing advance knowledge about the memo i was defending lee 
and i take him at his word he said today 
ive heard myself on tape and i am inarticulate he added 
rollins told a party meeting in indiana earlier this week 
i dont care how nice a man tom foley is and he is a very 
very fine man just let me preface this by saying we made a 
terrible mistake last week as a party the national committee which 
lee atwater my friend and my deputy for four years his committee 
made a very serious mistake i dont think i take him at his word 
that he didnt know about it but you cant go out and deal with 
innuendos and rumors you need to go out and deal like i said in 
facts 
the memo depicted foley as a liberal and compared his voting 
record to that of rep barney frank dmass an acknowledged 
homosexual congressman mark goodin an aide to atwater resigned 
under fire after saying he had approved the memo 
bush did not mention the memo episode during a speech wednesday 
night at a fundraising dinner on the eve of a twoday meeting of 
the rnc in washington but he had high praise for atwater 
lee atwater is doing a great job the president said he 
has been a strong voice and a convincing voice about the need to 
reach out to minorities and the disadvantaged 
bushs praise of atwater brought applause from the partisan crowd 
meetings of the partys executive resolutions and rules 
committees were scheduled for today with atwater house republican 
whip newt gingrich of georgia and other gop leaders scheduled to 
speak on friday 
bush also touched obliquely on the recent ethical turmoil in 
congress saying clearly it is time for an evenhanded ethical 
approach across all branches of government 
but he said we will keep the competition on the issues 
some democrats have asked bush to call for atwaters resignation 
because of the rnc memo which was headed tom foley out of the 
liberal closet the memo compared the voting record of foley 
dwash with that of frank dmass an acknowledged homosexual 
foley was elected speaker after wright dtexas resigned the 
position in the midst of an investigation by the house ethics 
committee rep tony coelho dcalif also announced his 
resignation after allegations about a purchase of junk bonds both 
men denied any wrongdoing 
house republican leader robert michel of illinois told the 
fundraiser audience wednesday night that reform of the house must 
be at the very heart of our partys effort as it moves toward the 
1990 congressional elections

a woman testified today that she saw the 
man accused of killing prime minister olof palme shouting in a 
drunken rage in september and extolling the leaders death 
the witness sigrid lovisa malm testifed that carl gustaf 
christer pettersson said that if palme had not been dead already he 
should be killed 
she said pettersson also may have said he killed palme but she 
could not make out his exact words 
palme swedens fourterm prime minister was killed feb 28 
1986 and his wife lisbeth was wounded when they were attacked by 
a gunman as they left a movie theater 
pettersson was arrested in december 
mrs malm 64 testified that she saw pettersson at a suburban 
train station ranting against palme and praising his death 
she said pettersson shouted that i or someone shot palme 
she said she was frightened by his drunken aggressiveness and could 
not distinquish whether he was saying jag the swedish word for 
i or man which means someone 
the prosecution also produced a witness to contradict 
petterssons alibi that he spent the evening at a gambling club and 
then went home 
reinhold julius jansson 60 disputed petterssons claim that 
pettersson jansson and lena akerlund met at the club a few hours 
before palme was shot 
jansson said i cant remember meeting either christer or lena 
that day asked if he thought pettersson was lying jansson said 
maybe he got the day wrong 
miss akerlund who also testified said she did not trust her 
memory because i was constantly on drugs mixed with booze 
pettersson initially was a suspect in the slaying but was not 
charged until this year because of a bungled investigation in which 
authorities pursued a theory that the killing was the result of an 
international conspiracy 
palmes widow is to testify on monday after the court granted a 
list of her conditions including the exclusion of pettersson from 
the courtroom the court refused however to hear her testimony in 
a session closed to the public

former premier jacques chirac has renewed debate 
over whether france promised to free a proiranian prisoner who is 
serving a life sentence to win freedom for its hostages in lebanon 
answering questions from economics students in suburban 
cergypontoise chirac alluded to a possible pardon for anis 
naccache 
naccache who is lebanese is serving a life sentence for leading 
an unsuccessful attempt in 1980 to assassinate shahpour bakhtiar a 
former iranian prime minister living in exile in paris 
speaking about naccache and four other men convicted in the case 
chirac said tuesday night one might be wellinspired to consider 
the occasion that could be found to free these people in the july 14 
pardon because we are in a period of tension and should not add to 
the reasons that might make us targets of terrorism chirac said 
he was speaking from intuition not from information of a 
particular terrorist threat 
july 14 is bastille day the holiday commemorating the french 
revolution and there is a government tradition of issuing pardons 
as part of the celebration 
french newspapers today gave the matter frontpage play and 
sought to determine chiracs motives for making the comment 
iranian leaders have called for naccaches release and his case 
was widely reported to have been part of a deal chiracs government 
negotiated in 1988 that brought home all frenchmen held hostage by 
proiranian groups in lebanon 
chirac has denied that freedom for naccache was part of the deal 
which he said involved only a promise to normalize diplomatic 
relations with iran 
president francois mitterrand who defeated chirac in the may 
1988 presidential election less than a week after the french 
hostages were freed said he would pardon naccache only if there was 
proof that chiracs government had made such a promise 
the socialist government had no comment on chiracs statement 
most political leaders reacted guardedly although jeanmarie le pen 
of the extremeright national front said the suggestion of a pardon 
was indecent 
naccaches former lawyer antoine comte was quoted today in the 
leftist daily liberation as saying chirac may have intended to lay 
the groundwork for a political consensus in favor of a pardon 
if jacques chirac says today that a solution must be found 
its no doubt because he wants to help the president get out of this 
affair with the agreement of all political forces comte was 
quoted as saying 
naccache has claimed to be a spokesman for the lebanese 
proiranian hezbollah or party of god it is widely believed that 
his attack on bakhtiar was ordered by senior iranian officials 
possibly by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini himself

the supreme court today shielded states from 
federal court lawsuits by parents seeking to enforce a federal law 
aimed at assuring adequate education for handicapped children 
the justices voted 54 to excuse pennsylvania officials from 
paying a years private school tuition for a student with a learning 
disability 
justice anthony m kennedy in his opinion for the court said 
the broad constitutional immunity from suit enjoyed by states cannot 
be eliminated unless congress makes that intent unmistakably clear 
in the language of the statute evidence of congressional intent 
must be both unequivocal and textual 
kennedy said the possible intent of congress to limit sovereign 
immunity for states cannot be inferred for example from statements 
made by sponsors of a bill on the floor of the house or senate 
in a dissenting opinion justice william j brennan said the 
court was trying to impose rules on congress retroactively 
it is perfectly clear that again the court ignores congress 
actual intent to abrogate state immunity instead resorting to an 
interpretative standard that congress could have anticipated only 
with the aid of a particularly effective crystal ball he said 
he was joined by justices thurgood marshall harry a blackmun 
and john paul stevens 
joining kennedy were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia 
todays ruling applies to lawsuits against states in federal but 
not necessarily state courts 
the high court overturned a ruling last year by the 3rd us 
circuit court of appeals that said pennsylvania failed to comply 
with procedures established by the education for all handicapped 
children act 
the 1975 law provides federal aid to states and in return imposes 
various requirements on them 
pennsylvania was accused of violating procedures aimed at 
assuring impartiality and prompt decisions when parents challenge 
the adequacy of education programs for their children 
the 3rd circuit court ordered pennsylvania to reimburse russell 
muth of bucks county pa for tuition he paid to send his son 
alexander to a private school in massachusetts for the 198384 
academic year muth also was awarded attorneys fees by the lower 
court 
alexander who had been living with his mother in colombia was 
10 years old in 1980 when he came to live with his father in 
pennsylvania 
the boy was diagnosed as a gifted handicapped child with a 
language learning disability 
officials of the central bucks school district placed him 
initially in special classes for speech and language therapy and in 
regular classes for art music and other activities 
a dispute arose between alexanders father and school officials 
in 1983 after the boy was mainstreamed placed in regular 
classes and the experience proved unsuccessful 
school officials then revised the education program for 
alexander but his father was dissatisfied and sent his son to the 
landmark school a private school in massachusetts for the 198384 
academic year alexander returned to the central bucks schools in 
1986 
muth sued local and state officials in 1984 in federal court a 
federal judge ruled that the states procedures for resolving 
disputes over schooling for handicappped children violated the 1975 
federal law 
the judge ruled that even though the program proposed in 1983 
for alexander by public school officials was acceptable the state 
violated muths procedural rights 
the 3rd circuit court agreed ruling that the pennsylvania 
secretary of edcuation played an improper role in reviewing muths 
case 
the appeals court said the secretary was not sufficiently 
impartial to act as a hearing officer in the case and also made muth 
wait too long for a final decision that could be appealed in court 
the case is dellmuth vsd muth 871855

astronomers have spotted nine objects that may be 
brown dwarfs lumps of gas more massive than planets that 
scientists believe exist but have not yet confirmed a researcher 
reports 
the objects do not appear to be in orbit around stars where 
astronomers had first looked for brown dwarfs their apparent 
independence from stars bolsters the idea that brown dwarfs may help 
explain a key mystery of the cosmos said william forrest of the 
university of rochester in new york 
forrest spoke in a telephone interview before presenting the work 
thursday at a meeting of the american astronomical society in ann 
arbor mich he did the research with other scientists at his 
school the university of massachusetts at amherst and the 
university of hawaii in honolulu 
according to theory there are lumps of gas in the universe that 
failed to become stars because they did not ignite the internal 
nuclear reaction that makes stars shine they could still shine a 
little because of energy created as their gas collapses under its 
own gravity scientists who have theorized their existence have 
dubbed them brown dwarfs 
scientists are interested in brown dwarfs partly because they may 
help explain what is called the missing mass problem studies show 
that outer space contains more matter than scientists have observed 
and nobody knows what form this missing mass takes part of it may 
be brown dwarfs 
astronomers have generally looked for brown dwarfs in orbit 
around stars but the newfound objects may be freefloating instead 
suggesting that brown dwarfs may be far more numerous than they 
could be as stellar orbiters forrest said 
so they may make up a significant part of the missing mass 
relatively close to the sun and perhaps beyond he said 
if brown dwarfs exist they would be hard to spot because they 
would be so dim forrest and his colleagues looked toward an area 
where stars and maybe brown dwarfs are still forming to catch 
brown dwarfs at their brightest 
they chose a region in the constellation taurus where young 
stars can be seen amid clouds of gas more than 450 lightyears from 
earth a lightyear is the distance light travels in a year about 
59 trillion miles 
four of the newfound objects show the strongest evidence of being 
brown dwarfs based on the combination of their brightnesses and 
estimated age forrest said their motion across the sky suggests 
they lie within the taurus clouds making them perhaps about 1 
million years old he said 
the argument for the other five objects is based on their reddish 
colors this evidence is good but it isnt really overwhelming 
forrest said 
the newfound objects appear to contain five to 15 times the mass 
of jupiter the largest planet which is more than 300 times as 
massive as earth 
the evidence that the nine objects are freefloating rather than 
orbiting around stars comes from analyzing their apparent distances 
from nearby stars forrest said essentially they tend to be 
farther away from the stars than one would expect if they were in 
orbit he said 
jonathan lunine an expert in brown dwarf theory at the 
university of arizona said he was not familiar with details of 
forrests work but that the results seem quite sensible 
the study also provides fairly good evidence hes found some 
freefloaters lunine said

the story of james richardson who 
spent 21 years in prison wrongfully accused of murdering his seven 
children has become the center of a war of words between movie 
producers and lawyers 
richardson wants a feature film about his crusade for freedom 
done by producer steve jaffe who bought the dramatic rights to a 
1970 book about the case by richardsons lawyer mark lane 
my project is more accurate said richardson freed april 25 
in arcadia after a special prosecutor said he was unjustly accused 
in the 1967 murders 
lane and jaffe richardson says control the rights to his life 
story 
but producers suzanne stanford and gene kraft told the st 
petersburg times that they have obtained the rights to everybody 
except james richardson including newspaper reporters richardson 
relatives and arcadia residents who advanced the case while 
richardson was in jail 
theres a tremendous story that surrounds richardson during 
that time kraft said richardsons trial and legal challenges are 
available to any screenwriter as public record and his story is 
basically the backdrop he said 
kraft said that if that logic fails to impress network 
executives the couples partner might david l wolper productions 
wolper known for his extravaganzas for the 1984 olympics and the 
statue of liberty centennial is a network reliable one of a 
handful of producers programmers go to year after year he said 
a wolper executive confirmed stanford and kraft have a contract 
to develop the richardson story probably as a fourhour miniseries 
the times reported thursday 
jaffe accused his rival producers of trying to exploit 
richardson who now works for comedian and diet guru dick gregory 
who runs a health and weightloss clinic in fort walton beach 
and lane said they dont have james they dont have me i 
dont know who else there is 
kraft said thats lanes whole problem 
my feeling would be that mark lane is really going to do not 
the james richardson story but the mark lane story kraft said 
caught in the middle is ellis rubin he worked with lane as 
richardsons cocounsel but was fired after richardson went free 
lane claimed rubin threatened richardson while trying to cut his own 
movie deal 
kraft stanford and mark wolper david wolpers son acknowledge 
talking with rubin but rubin would not talk to a reporter unusual 
for the flamboyant miami lawyer 
lane said rubin has been silent because richardson sent a letter 
prohibiting him under the rules of professional responsibility 
from discussing his case 
furthermore lane says he will sue to stop any production that 
does not pay richardson for the story of injustice he endured for 21 
years

a military court today sentenced 
four israeli soldiers to up to nine months in jail for their roles 
in the beating of a palestinian who later died in custody 
the defendants left the courtroom angered by what their attorney 
termed particularly harsh sentences and immediately got into 
fistfights with photographers waiting outside 
a photographer for the hebrew daily yediot ahronot suffered a 
black eye in the 10minute melee and a military policeman who was a 
friend of one of the soldiers was taken into custody for the assault 
also today police raided a news service run by sari nusseibeh a 
palestinian activist accused by israel of being a mastermind and plo 
paymaster of the palestinian uprising 
authorities ordered the holy land press service closed for two 
years and nusseibeh said he was told to report to police 
headquarters for questioning 
the office was being used to advance the goals of the plo and 
find ways to incite the uprising police spokesman uzi sandori 
said 
in another development an israeli cameraman for abctv was shot 
in the head today with a plastic bullet by israeli troops dispersing 
palestinian stone throwers in the west bank town of ramallah a 
network producer said a military official said the television crew 
violated an army order putting the area off limits to reporters the 
camaraman was hospitalized in good condition 
the four soldiers were convicted on may 25 of brutality in the 
beating of 42yearold hani elshami on aug 22 while arresting him 
in a sweep of the gaza strips jabaliya refugee camp 
they had been accused of manslaughter but were acquitted when the 
judge ruled that elshami died after a second beating inflicted by 
other soldiers at a military camp the other soldiers have not been 
charged or tried 
the judge col emanuel gross today sentenced three of the 
soldiers to 18 months in prison nine months of the term to be 
suspended they were 1st sgt yitzhak adler 21 pvt yitzhak 
kibbudi 20 and pvt ron hakel 19 
a fourth soldier pvt ariyeh luchato 20 was sentenced to a 
year in prison six months suspended because he arrived in the 
middle of the beating 
defense attorney uziel atzmon described the sentences as 
particularly harsh especially since we had the feeling that the 
major responsibility fell on the commanders 
the case was seen as a test of the armys willingness to 
discipline soldiers accused of brutality and focused attention on 
the armys beating policy since the uprising began december 1987 
516 palestinians have died and more than 10000 have been injured 
twentytwo israelis have also been killed 
police spokesman uzi sandori said authorities ordered the holy 
land press service because the office in israeliannexed arab east 
jerusalem was being used to advance the goals of the plo and find 
ways to incite the uprising 
about two dozen police officers who entered nusseibehs 
secondfloor office carried out boxes and plastic bags filled with 
papers 
officers changed the office lock and welded the entrance shut 
i have no idea why this was done nusseibeh a philosophy 
professor at the west banks bir zeit university told reporters 
sandori said police had evidence the office was being used to 
help the plo and its fatah faction headed by plo chief yasser 
arafat the plo is outlawed in israel sandori said police will 
review the papers and then we will see if we have a good reason to 
investigate him but we wanted to close his office 
the ramallah shooting occurred at 11 am when the abc crew was 
filming israeli troops dispersing a stonethrowing riot said abc 
producer lynn eshel 
the bullet struck cameraman shlomo franco 42 above one eye 
yael bossem a spokeswoman at hadassah mount scopus hospital in

mikhail s gorbachev today said the 
berlin wall is no great problem in eastwest relations and he 
applauded natos new willingness to negotiate cuts in shortrange 
missiles 
at a news conference in bonn on the final day of his fourday 
state visit the soviet leader praised the results of his talks with 
west german leaders as having opened a new path toward improved ties 
among european nations 
he hailed a declaration on european goals that he signed with 
chancellor helmut kohl on tuesday as the visits most important 
accomplishment a step toward dissolving the confrontational 
nature of our relations 
after a visit to west germanys industrial ruhr valley and a 
meeting with political leaders in north rhinewestphalia state 
gorbachev and his wife raisa departed for moscow from duesseldorf 
airport at 626 pm 
the gorbachevs drew applause cheers and shouts of approval from 
more than 8000 workers at the dortmund headquarters of hoesch a 
giant steel concern 
at the bonn news conference gorbachev was asked if he considered 
the berlin wall which divides the two germanys an unacceptable 
symbol of a time of more troubled relations 
i dont think the berlin wall is the sole barrier between east 
and west gorbachev told about 500 journalists at the summit press 
center we must improve many situations in europe 
he observed that nothing is eternal and conditions on the 
continent may some day make all border obstructions obsolete but he 
said of the berlin wall in conclusion i see this as no great 
problem 
at the news conference attended by his wife raisa and senior 
officials of the kremlin delegation gorbachev was asked if he could 
envision a day when europe would recognize a single germany 
the situation in europe today was determined by historical 
realities gorbachev responded but he added that the continent is 
undergoing great political change and time will tell 
we can hope that we are on the right path to better relations 
among european states the kremlin leader said 
in his 25minute opening statement gorbachev welcomed the new 
nato position on shortrange missiles reached in brussels last 
month nato agreed that a partial reductiion of the missiles could 
be negotiated once an agreement to balance conventional forces 
begins being put into effect 
the brussels document contains quite a few positive and 
constructive elements he said but he added that the soviets do 
not view it as a major breakthrough since it contains a lot of 
elements of the old philosophy such as reliance on nuclear 
deterrence 
gorbachev spoke in russian and his remarks were translated 
simultaneously into english 
asked by a soviet journalist whether he was surprised by his 
enthusiastic reception by thousands of cheering west germans 
gorbachev said he attributed the welcome in part to the hopes pinned 
on his policies 
in the whole world people want changes for the better he 
said they are tired of the cold war 
the kremlin leader who outscores president bush and kohl in west 
german opinion polls has been warmly received since his arrival on 
monday not since president john f kennedys visit in 1961 have 
west germans given a foreign statesman such a jubilant reception 
in reply to another question the soviet leader hedged on the 
government crackdown in china he stressed that all of us are very 
much concerned at what is happening and expressed hope that the 
people and the government of china can find a way out of their 
difficulties 
a moment of humor occurred at the news conference when a 
czechoslovak journalist questioning gorbachev addressed him as mr 
president 
since when have i become a mister asked gorbachev alluding 
to the practice among officials of communist nations of addressing 
each other as comrade 
the journalist replied that he had used the term because we are 
in the federal republic of germany then repeated his question to 
mr comrade president gorbachev 
the kremlin leaders news conference lasted barely an hour 
including the opening statement 
gorbachev was then given a formal farewell from bonn by president 
richard von weizsaecker before he traveled to dortmund in the 
industrial heartland of the ruhr he flies home from duesseldorf 
later today

people who do not own property may not be 
excluded for that reason from membership on a public body empowered 
to recommend a reorganization of local government a unanimous 
supreme court ruled today 
the court declared unconstitutional the composition of the st 
louis cityst louis county board of freeholders 
justice harry a blackmun writing for the court said a 
landownership requirement for appointment to such a public agency 
violates the constitutions guarantee of equal protection under law 
for all people 
the mere fact that the board of freeholders considers landuse 
issues cannot suffice to sustain a landownership requirement in 
this case he said 
the st louis freeholder board was created to write a proposed 
charter for reorganizing the city and county government structure 
the board also was empowered to recommend new taxes to finance the 
city and county governments 
any proposals by the board would be submitted to the voters in a 
referendum 
board members were appointed by the mayor of st louis the 
county executive and the governor of missouri 
state representative robert j quinn a st louis county resident 
who does not own property said his rights were violated by a state 
constitutional requirement limiting membership on the freeholder 
board to property owners 
quinn in a suit on behalf of himself and all others in the city 
and county who do not own property said the exclusion violated the 
us constitutions guarantee of freedom from unlawful 
discrimination 
but the missouri supreme court ruled last year that the 
constitutional protection does not apply because the freeholder 
board does not have general governmental powers 
blackmun said today that even though the freeholder board has a 
limited role that does not mean its composition can violate 
constitutional protections against invidious discrimination 
the case is quinn vs millsap 881048

the federal investigation at rocky flats may 
get to the bottom of decadeold rumors of a nuclear chain reaction 
occurring at the weapons plant during fires 20 or more years ago 
rocky flats critics long have suspected that such a reaction 
which could send radioactivity into the air happened during one or 
both fires in 1957 and 1969 
studies in 1977 and 1987 revealed relatively high quantities of 
two radioactive elements that can be produced during a nuclear 
reaction but officials at the time said their presence can be 
explained in several other ways 
rocky flats officials have denied the fires led to a chain 
reaction although it was acknowledged that plutonium was released 
into the atmosphere as a result of the blazes 
the denver post today quoted unidentified sources as saying that 
if a chain reaction did occur at rocky flats evidence of it may 
surface in department of energy or rockwell international corp 
documents regarding waste disposal 
federal agents raided the plant june 6 as part of an 
investigation of alleged illegal storage and disposal of hazardous 
waste at the plant 
rocky flats 16 miles from denver manufactures plutonium 
triggers for nuclear bombs it is operated for doe by rockwell 
dr carl johnson former jefferson county health director first 
raised the issue of a possible nuclear reaction at rocky flats in 
1977 he found relatively high levels of radioactive cesium in soil 
samples outside the plant 
a 1987 rockwell study of groundwater at rocky flats found high 
levels of strontium 
cesium and strontium are produced during a nuclear reaction 
rockwell and doe officials said the cesium and strontium came 
from fallout from atmospheric bomb tests in nevada and elsewhere 
but rocky flats critics said the levels are too high to be caused 
by fallout and the environmental protection agency asked the plant 
in 1987 for more precise tests 
rockwell and doe officials are conducting those tests said nat 
miullo rocky flats project director for the epa in denver 
the levels are still extremely low and no data we have now 
indicate that such a reaction occurred miullo said but he said 
the epa would not accept rocky flats explanation for the elements 
presence without further evidence 
to reach that conclusion based on less than highquality data 
is something we will not stand beside miullo told the new york 
times 
he said the strontium and cesium also may have been used in the 
calibration of testing instruments and then dumped on the ground or 
they may have showed up as the result of false readings

states may be forced through private lawsuits 
to help pay for cleaning up hazardous waste sites targeted under the 
socalled superfund act the supreme court ruled today 
by a 54 vote the justices said the constitutions commerce 
clause gives congress the power to strip state governments of their 
constitutional immunity against private lawsuits 
the decision will force pennsylvania to defend itself against a 
lawsuit by union gas co aimed at recovering the cleanup costs the 
company owes the federal government 
officials from pennsylvania and 17 other states had told the 
hight court that a ruling against pennsylvania could expose states 
to 100 billion in superfund cleanup costs 
hazardous coal tar from an abandoned union gas facility began 
seeping into brodhead creek near stroudsburg pa after state flood 
control officials struck the deposit during excavation in 1980 
federal environmental officials worked with pennsylvania to clean 
up the problem at a cost of about 14 million 
the federal government then sued union gas to recover part of the 
money invoking the superfund law also known as the comprehensive 
environmental response compensation and liability act 
union gas in turn sued pennsylvania its lawsuit accused the 
state of negligently contributing to the discharge of the hazardous 
material 
the philadelphiabased 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled 
that 1986 amendments to the superfund law eliminated the states 
constitutional immunity in such cases and the suit could go forward 
the appeals court said the constitutions commerce clause allows 
congress to eliminate such immunity 
today the supreme court agreed 
writing the courts main opinion justice william j brennan said 
the superfund law renders states liable in money damages in 
federal court and added that congress has the authority to 
render them so liable when legislating pursuant to the commerce 
clause 
he was joined fully by justices thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens and in part by justice byron r 
white 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia 
sandra day oconnor and anthony m kennedy voted to dismiss the suit 
against pennsylvania they said the states immunity should prevail 
pennsylvania officials with the support of 17 other states said 
the appeals court ruling wrongly exposed them to great financial 
burdens 
federal environmental officials have listed some 22000 hazardous 
waste sites with cleanup costs approaching 100 billion the state 
officials said 
supporting pennsylvanias appeal were new york california 
connecticut illinois indiana iowa kentucky maryland missouri 
new jersey new mexico north carolina oklahoma south carolina 
utah vermont and west virginia

a 2000footlong section of beach on this 
tiny resort island was declared an emergency area as the gulf of 
mexico eats away beach front and threatens to wash away a motel 
workers for the islands municipal government started putting 
sandbags around the edgewater motel late wednesday 24 hours after 
the state of emergency was declared 
theres no danger of the building falling overnight mayor 
andy valence said as water lapped at the pilings under the 
edgewater but he said something had to be done to protect the 
building and nearby louisiana highway 1 the only route to and from 
the island 
its bad i dont know whats going to happen said motel 
owner henrietta collins i have apartments right on the beach and 
its washing my pilings out ive already lost my land 
she said that before hurricane gilbert last year the beach 
extended out a hundred yards from her motel 
hurricanes last year eroded large areas but such huge storms 
arent the only problem valence said wind up to 20 mph in recent 
days has contributed to choppy water that accelerates natural 
erosion 
last week on one day we lost five feet now with the southwest 
winds and about 3foot seas the beach area in the middle part of 
the island is really being damaged valence said 
grand isles erosion problems have become more apparent in recent 
years as state and federal officials have become more aware of the 
loss of marshy land all along louisianas coast 
louisiana loses 30 to 50 square miles of its coastal marshes 
every year about an acre every 15 minutes an area the size of 
rhode island over the past 30 years more than 100 barrier islands 
have disappeared off the louisiana coast in 50 years 
part of the loss is due to salt water intrusion through canals 
dredged for cypress logging at the turn of the century and for 
oilfield exploration and development over the past 50 years the 
salt water kills vegetation that holds the marshes together 
but most of the loss stems from the taming of the mississippi 
river which used to spread tons of silt and fresh water through the 
marshes rebuilding wetlands and barrier islands with levees the 
length of the river and 27 sets of locks and dams along the 
mississippi and its tributaries the silt no longer reaches the 
marshes

two men who aspire to lead greece into the 
1990s are locked in political combat so blunt and bellicose that 
allegations of illicit sex government corruption and even nazi 
sympathies have buried the issues 
premier andreas papandreou 70 and opposition leader constantine 
mitsotakis 71 head into sundays national elections on the heels 
of what many have called the most slanderous campaign since the 
return to democracy in 1974 
most people buy three newspapers a day to find out who is 
stealing who is selling out and who is having sex with who said 
film director nikos koundouros 
the feud between the two men whose personal emnity dates back to 
1965 has obscured the fact that greece has the highest inflation 
rate biggest deficit and weakest currency in the european economic 
community 
these phenomena are characteristic of a war of mutual 
destruction between two gladiators and of efforts to shift the 
peoples attention from the countrys burning issues says 
leonidas kyrkos a leader of a leftist coalition that is greeces 
third major political force 
the interior ministry says 789 million greeks are eligible to 
vote the 300 seats in parliament a party that wins a majority can 
name the premier and cabinet 
papandreous panhellenic socialist movement controls 154 of the 
seats mitsotakis conservative new democracy party holds 111 and 
the remaining 45 are split between 20 small parties and independents 
mitsotakis party led by about 10 percentage points in recent 
polls but 15 percent of voters were undecided and the close race 
raises the possibility of a coalition or minority government 
mitsotakis has hammered away at a financial scandal shaking 
papandreous government and opposition newspapers are having a 
field day with the premiers affair with a much younger woman and 
his divorce friday from his americanborn wife margaret 
nude photos of papandreous 35yearold fiancee dimitra liani 
became almost daily fixtures in rightwing newspapers after the 
premier announced the affair in september 
he has made us the laughing stock of the world mitsotakis 
tells supporters 
the progovernment daily avriani responded with what it alleged 
were transcripts of mitsotakis intimate telephone conversations 
with a woman who was not his wife and a radio station owned by the 
newspaper aired the almost inaudible tapes for days 
no politician in greece has been slurred as much as i have and 
this is a continuation of those attacks mitsotakis said the day 
after the tapes aired andreas papandreou and government security 
services are behind this 
the opposition press recently published excerpts from a diary 
kept by the premiers former chief bodyguard that alleges 
papandreous involvement in numerous sexual liaisons telephone 
tapping and other intrigues 
that is how pitiful they have become their slander does not 
touch us papandreou said at a recent campaign rally 
the mudslinging is fueled by the partisan nature of greeces mass 
media 
people have become used to the poison said serapheim 
fyntanides managing editor of the liberal daily eleftherotypia 
fyntanides newspaper ran a blank front page one day this month 
to protest the sleazy campaign 
papandreou handily defeated mitsotakis in the 1985 elections but 
the men have been bitter rivals since mitsotakis defected from the 
party run by panpandreous father in 1965 
both accuse the other of engaging in political intrigues that led 
to the military dictatorship that ruled greece from 1967 until 1974 
the insinuations can be as deadly as the blunt accusations one 
government newspaper runs a halfpage photo daily of mitsotakis 
flanked by two german soldiers implying he collaborated with the 
nazis during world war ii 
mitsotakis points out that he was a member of the resistance 
arrested twice and sentenced to death by the nazis in his native 
crete when the picture first appeared in 1985 he responded that 
both germans were sympathizers of the resistance 
papandreous party portrays the new democracy as too willing to 
sell out to foreign interests and buckle to us influence 
mitsotakis contends the ruling party has cost the country 400 
billion drachmas 23 billion in 24 of the betterknown scandals 
george koskotas a greek financier jailed in the united states 
alleges papandreou authorized the 200 million looting of koskotas 
bank of crete as a way to finance the governing party 
mitsotakis advocates a free market economy and pledges to 
streamline greek bureaucracy and cut the 14 percent annual inflation 
rate he said he considers nato membership and us military bases 
vital to greeces defense 
papandreou came to power in 1981 promising to pull greece out of 
nato and the eec and to close the american military bases here 
however the premier now says greece benefits from its membership in 
both groups and his government is close to a new bases agreement 
with the united states

its not the fish that are biting in 
western ireland its the voters 
anger about the governments fishinglicense law was the oddest 
but hardly the least significant issue in irelands national 
election thursday 
the nations unwanted reputation as a net exporter of people was 
an issue closely linked with continuing high unemployment 
cuts in the national health service brought complaints of 
patients being left on gurneys because no beds were available and 
every party promised to spend money to improve matters 
in western ireland the fishing license uproar dominated the 
campaign i am totally baffled by it prime minister charles 
haughey confessed i think its the most extraordinary development 
ever in irish politics 
haugheys government pushed through the license plan 15 pounts 
about 2025 a year for trout and 10 pounds about 1350 for 
other fish effective jan 1 1988 
outraged anglers arent just refusing to pay theyve shut down 
fishing in troutfilled waters such as lough corrib and with it the 
tourist industry 
signs around oughterard on the lough shore scream defiance 
no rod license 
in county galway the combined fishing clubs turned out 200 
members to canvass against candidates from haugheys fianna fail 
party 
the rod license made political bedfellows of candidates of fine 
gael the party of shopkeepers and the workers party irelands 
disciples of karl marx 
michael ryan who owns a guest house in cong and chairs the local 
fianna fail branch campaigned this year for an independent who 
opposed the rod license 
im not changing my politics he said im just fighting 
them on this issue 
eamon o cuiv a member of the dail or parliament from galway 
west said he hears about the issue every day of the week not 
just here but right around the country 
its only 15 pounds haughey declared in exasperation on a 
radio phonein program 
its not pounds but principles said a caller to which haughey 
retorted principles get people in an awful lot of trouble 
the fish license was only one of the burning issues as the 24 
million eligible voters went to the polls to choose among 367 
candidates for the 166seat dail 
turnout was 20 percent by lunchtime on target to match the 73 
percent in 1987 voters were also electing 15 members to the 
european parliament 
haughey found himself in a lot of trouble over cuts in the health 
service 
in pursuit of lower budget deficits the 63yearold prime 
minister closed 15 hospitals with the loss of 3600 beds 
in the last general election in 1987 haughey had campaigned 
against the health cuts proposed by the fine gaellabor coalition 
government and he has been reminded frequently of fianna fail 
billboards two years ago which said health cuts hurt the old the 
sick and the handicapped 
fine gael leader alan dukes a 44yearold dublin economist 
promised to take 40 million from the national lottery and spend it 
on health haughey has promised total health expenditures of 175 
billion 
emigration which had been 24000 a year under haugheys 
predecessor garret fitzgerald has climbed past 30000 during 
haugheys watch 
campaigning in arklow dukes heard fine gael councillor vincent 
mcelheron tally the losses 600 gone from the town in eight months 
four families departed just from one row of six houses we used to 
have a boom town mcelheron said now its dead 
haughey pointed to 20000 new jobs in manufacturing and trade in 
1988 subtract the lost jobs and it was only a net gain of 3000 
but that was the first significant increase after the country lost 
75000 jobs between 1980 and 1987 
soldiers pay also figures three soldiers wives were running on 
the single issue of better pay for their husbands 
haughey continued to preach fiscal restraint sometimes at a 
personal level 
to a woman in kilkenny who shouted a demand for a 5 percent 
increase in the widows pension haughey retorted youre young 
enough and good looking enough to get married again

the vietnamese government has informed the 
united states it will return next week the remains of what it 
believes are 28 american servicemen missing from the vietnam war 
the pentagon said thursday 
spokesman pete williams said the transfer of the remains would 
occur wednesday with a team of us military officials flying to 
hanoi the remains will be flown to an army laboratory in hawaii for 
possible identification he said 
the repatriation will be the 10th since august 1987 when the 
united states made a special effort to enlist greater assistance 
from vietnam in accounting for missing americans 
the group of 28 is one of the largest to be returned by the 
vietnamese government the largest repatriation occurred last 
december and involved the remains of 38 individuals 
the us government recognizes and appreciates the efforts of 
the vietnamese government which resulted in this unilateral 
repatriation and hopes that such accelerated cooperation will 
continue to bring increased accountability for americans still 
missing or otherwise unaccounted for in vietnam 
the pentagon said it had not received any information from 
vietnam on precisely where the various remains had been recovered or 
the circumstances surrounding their discovery 
currently 2353 americans continue to be listed as missing in 
indochina as a result of the vietnam war of whom 1719 are listed 
as missing in vietnam 
all told the remains of 200 americans have been repatriated to 
the united states from vietnam and subsequently identified by the 
army lab since the end of the war 
in the past remains repatriated by vietnam have occasionally 
included those of vietnamese individuals as a result the pentagon 
routinely declines to predict whether all repatriated remains can be 
individually identified by the army laboratory in honolulu

hecklers and a lastminute lawsuit failed to stop 
the opening today of underground atlanta a 142 million complex of 
shops restaurants and clubs designed to put the fun back into 
downtown atlanta 
mayor andrew youngs speech was drowned out by homeless advocates 
blowing whistles and chanting atlanta keeps the homeless 
underground police said six protesters were moved they were not 
immediately charged 
earlier today a judge refused to block the developers from 
calling the project underground atlanta ruling against a company 
called underground atlanta inc that claims to hold the rights to 
the name 
the project the result of a threeyear overhaul by the rouse 
co is seen by backers as the solution to the common complaint that 
theres not much fun downtown it offers 22 restaurants and clubs 
and nearly 100 retailers 
at a news conference young said underground atlanta has given 
the citys center a boost of confidence and strengthened its shaky 
investment climate 
its importance to the city of atlanta was a heart transplant 
he said what weve done is put in a new heart it makes other 
things happen 
at the opening ceremony young angrily began defending the citys 
record on the homeless against hecklers then gave up trying to 
speak the number of demonstrators was unclear because they were 
scattered throughout the crowd 
wind and rain moved through the city just before the complex 
opened but the party held in a covered area went on as planned 
about 2000 attended with 2000 more milling about the complex far 
fewer than the hopedfor tens of thousands 
the original underground atlanta opened in the citys viaducts in 
1969 but closed in 1982 under the perception that it was riddled 
with crime the new version is around the original site but is three 
times bigger

the picturesque university of california los 
angeles campus is one of southern californias major sources of 
pollution says a ucla study 
the university creates 15000 tons of solid waste 800 tons of 
medical waste and 100 tons of hazardous waste such as asbestos 
poisons and explosive chemicals each year researchers in the 
graduate school of architecture and urban planning estimated 
state legislators have expressed interest in the study because 
universities historically have been exempt from many environmental 
regulations 
officials at the campus located in an area of gentle rolling 
hills six miles from the pacific ocean and 12 miles from downtown 
los angeles said they will study the report and consider some of 
its recommendations 
the universitys manicured grounds filled with palm trees 
magnolias and acres of green grass even come under criticism in the 
study those grounds require huge amounts of water in an arid region 
that might be better served by desert vegetation the study said 
we do not mean to imply that ucla is a worse polluter than 
other universities and certainly not than some industries but it 
certainly plays a role said robert gottlieb faculty adviser to 
the six graduate students who wrote the study he described the 
findings for a los angeles times story thursday a day in advance of 
the studys release 
the purpose of the study is to show as graphically as 
possible what that role is and how a university like ucla with 
all of its intellectual and scientific resources is uniquely 
positioned to start solving some of the nations most complex 
environmental problems 
the campus is the citys third largest user of electricity the 
eighth largest consumer of water and with its large fleet of 
vehicles the 10th largest producer of carbon monoxide the study 
says 
some suggestions in the study for cutting down on waste include 
using coffee mugs instead of disposable cups making photocopies on 
both sides of a sheet of paper replacing campus mail envelopes with 
reusable folders

cleanup ordinance broke into a couples home while they were out of 
town and threw out or gave away their belongings because they 
thought the house was vacant 
our lives have been thrown away said dawn wynn 52 
everything that weve had that represented a lifetime is gone 
town officials in this eastern idaho community with the help of 
an agent for the wynns mortgage company cleared out the home and 
buried the items at the local landfill because the lawn had not been 
mowed and inoperable vehicles were stored on the property 
attorney scott hansen who represents mrs wynn and her husband 
leo 51 said the wynns son rick a construction worker in 
blackfoot finally went over to the house last week to mow the lawn 
only to find it stripped bare even the lawnmower had been hauled 
off 
i agree with city ordinances hansen said but its amazing 
how things have run amok he said a lawsuit was likely 
since last summer the wynns have been living in lovelock nev 
where wynn had found work as a mechanic for a mining company their 
son had been taking care of the house the wynns had lived in for 14 
years and planned eventually to retire in

it had passed last august after repeated letters to the wynns went 
unanswered cleanup enforcement officer rudy sanchez concluded the 
house was vacant 
according to hansen sanchez contacted the lomas mortgage co to 
advise officials they were responsible for cleaning up the yard 
lomas made arrangements to remove the wynns possessions and prepare 
the house for sale even though the wynns were current in the 
mortgage payments

earlier this month removed the belongings and took them to the 
local landfill or gave them to charities birth certificates and 
family photographs along with appliances jewelry and other items 
were disposed of 
although the dump does not accept household goods an employee 
took them hansen said and then realized the mistake and decided to 
bury the items with a bulldozer 
some goods have been recovered and returned and the dump is 
still being combed for more but many of the sentimental items were 
destroyed mrs wynn said 
there is no way to pay for the things that are gone she 
said my whole life has been violated and yanked away from me

mass mailings by 100 senators during 198788 
cost taxpayers more than 527 million the congressional watchdog 
common cause reported thursday 
the 27 senators seeking reelection last year spent 201 million 
of the total an average of 48 cents per household according to the 
common cause study 
the perhousehold figures compared to an average of 31 cents for 
the 67 senators who were not campaigning for reelection and 15 
cents for six senators who retired in 1988 
franked mass mailings are used for campaign purposes by members 
of congress and provide incumbents with an unfair and discriminatory 
advantage over their challengers common cause president fred 
wertheimer said the use of the frank for mass mailings should be 
eliminated or sharply curtailed 
the study said taxpayerfinanced mailing costs for both houses 
have increased from 489 million in fiscal 1978 to 1134 million 
for fiscal 1988 
the bulk of the cost is for mass mailings rather than individual 
letters sent out by a member in response to a constituents 
correspondence the study said 
in february the senate changed its policy and expanded from 
three to six the number of mass mailings each senator can make to 
every address in his or her state each year

mikhail s gorbachevs foray into 
the hardhat heartland of the ruhr valley thursday produced a 
roaring workers welcome for his reforms contrasting with the 
grumbles he has heard at home 
gorbachev and his wife raisa drew claps cheers whistles and 
shouts of approval from more than 8000 workers in hard hats at the 
dortmund headquarters of hoesch a giant steel concern 
gorby gorby chanted the crowd as gorbachev gave his first 
speech to workers in the west a rousing series of slogans 
punctuated throughout by thunderous applause 
the workers had waited almost two years to meet the soviet 
leader worried about job losses in the ruhrs outmoded heavy 
industry workers representatives from hoesch and other area firms 
wrote gorbachev in 1987 asking for more economic cooperation 
gorbachev gave them no firm contracts speaking instead about 
sovietgerman friendship he clearly enjoyed the response he got 
we dont know exactly what kind of society we are headed for 
but we know it will be a society of broad freedoms a society based 
on human qualities a society of peoples power he said 
no matter how hard it will be for us we will determinedly 
stick to this path of perestroika gorbachev said to roars from 
the crowd we feel your solidarity and in the name of our workers 
i thank you for this solidarity 
the ruhr workers untroubled by shortages of consumer goods that 
frustrate their soviet counterparts applauded gorbachev they 
vented their anger at a former economics minister otto lambsdorff 
who drew jeers and whistles when introduced as a guest alongside 
former social democratic chancellors willy brandt and helmut schmidt 
the workers presented gorbachev with a unique electronic toy 
complete with his portrait 
werner nass head of the works council at hoesch said the device 
was a miniature of an electronic votecounting system hoesch will 
deliver to the supreme soviet the new soviet legislature that 
gorbachev heads 
the kremlin leader beamed his thanks and left the hall amid more 
cheers 
outside security was tight and the mood less elated 
scores of uniformed police lined each side of gorbachevs route 
between hoesch and the train station 
police teams with dogs patrolled the road and residents of the 
workingclass neighborhood said they had been asked to close all 
windows and doors for more security as gorbachev drove past 
police issued megaphone warnings to residents to keep off 
sidewalks 
they were standing on the streets in bonn shaking his hand and 
here were not even allowed to get close said brigitte weidemann 
19 but she still praised gorbachev hes doing something about 
his countrys problems i think hes a good leader 
michael paprocki 67 a world war ii veteran disabled while 
fighting the soviets disagreed

said but hes not here for any other reason he should get his

chinese diplomat who asked for political asylum in the united states 
following chinas effort to crush the movement 
immigration officials in denmark said nine chinese citizens had 
applied for asylum 
australias parliament passed a motion condemning chinas 
military crackdown on protesters in beijing on june 34 and the 
continued arrests of activists 
the foreign ministry said vice consul dong qi in hiding in 
sydney since friday was granted permanent residence on humanitarian 
grounds 
hawke gave assurances that the 15405 chinese citizens in the 
country including 10600 students need not worry about being 
deported due to expired visas 
the government of australia will be keeping their situation 
under close and sympathetic review he said we would consider 
sympathetically the cases of any student who could be considered in 
any sense in danger by returning to china

australian embassy in beijing had granted refuge to student leader 
chai ling 
the 22yearold psychology student at beijing normal university 
is no 3 on the beijing governments list of 21 mostwanted leaders 
of the prodemocracy movement 
hawke said it served no purpose to speculate or talk about it 
there are obvious sensitivities involved he said 
a foreign ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said reports that ms ling was hiding at the embassy were way off 
the mark 
the south china morning post in hong kong reported that china was 
prepared to break relations with australia and the united states for 
harboring chinese activists at their embassies 
the us embassy in beijing is sheltering two leading chinese 
dissidents physicist fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian an 
assistant professor at beijing university 
fang did not participate in the seven weeks of demonstrations in 
tiananmen square but chinese authorities claim he led the 
prodemocracy movement 
the newspaper said if beijing broke relations chinese 
authorities would be free to enter embassy compounds and seize any 
chinese citizens being sheltered 
the paper did not identify its sources for the report the 
foreign ministry said it had no relation to reality 
in japan kyodo news service quoted unidentified japanese 
security officials as saying 27yearold ma qiuyun an attache at 
the chinese embassys consular office had asked for us asylum and 
remained in tokyo 
the japanese foreign ministry refused to comment kyodo said the 
office and security authorities were studying how to deal with the 
case 
a chinese embassy official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said by telephone we hope japanese government authorities 
concerned will act with prudence and the case will not affect the 
friendly relations between japan and china 
seven chinese studying in denmark and two people registered as 
businessmen applied for political asylum in that country in the past 
week said inge thomsen an immigration official thomsen declined 
to discuss the cases but said authorities would be cautious 
about forcing chinese to return home under present circumstances

the supreme court which touched off an uproar 
last year by considering reversal of a 1976 civil rights decision 
today upheld the use of a centuryold law to fight racial 
discrimination but barred using it to protect minorities against 
harassment 
the decisions were denounced by civil rights advocates who said 
court rulings in recent months had dealt a significant setback to 
civil rights law 
the justices unanimously reaffirmed that an 1866 law enacted to 
help freed slaves could be used to sue private citizens accused of 
race bias 
but the court by a separate 54 vote also ruled that the 
123yearold civil rights law cannot be invoked to fight racial 
harassment 
civil rights groups found little solace in the fact that a bigger 
defeat was avoided they said the decision on racial harassment is 
further evidence a newly solidified conservative majority is intent 
on rolling back years of progress for minorities and women 
this supreme court term has been a disaster for all those 
committed to equal employment opportunity said benjamin hooks and 
ralph neas of the leadership conference on civil rights 
speaking of a string of recent supreme court decisions sen 
edward m kennedy dmass said the endofterm decisions by the 
supreme court on civil rights are a growing cause of concern to 
congress and all americans who care about equal opportunity in our 
society and equal justice under law 
justice anthony m kennedy in his opinion for the court said 
adherence to precedent compelled the conservative majority on the 
court to uphold the 1976 ruling 
furthermore he said even if that ruling was based on a mistaken 
interpretation of law it is certain that it is not inconsistent 
with the prevailing sense of justice in this country to the 
contrary it is entirely consistent with our societys deep 
commitment to the eradication of discrimination based on a persons 
race or the color of his or her skin 
but justice kennedy said allowing suits for racial harassment was 
not envisioned by the 1866 law 
he said the law governs contractual rights not most conduct by 
an employer after an individual is hired 
the 1866 law covers only conduct at the initial formation of 
the contract and conduct which impairs the right to enforce contract 
obligations through legal process justice kennedy said 
in another decision the court gave states and state officials 
sweeping new protection from federal lawsuits accusing them of civil 
rights violations 
in a 54 ruling in a case from michigan the court said they may 
not be sued under an 1871 law that authorizes damages against 
persons who violate peoples civil liberties 
justice william j brennan in an opinion dissenting from the 
courts decision on racial harassment said what the court 
declines to snatch away with one hand it takes with the other 
brennan said the court has to strain hard to interpret the 
1866 law in a way that ignores powerful historic evidence about 
the reconstruction congress concerns to end race bias 
joining brennan in partial dissent were justices thurgood 
marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
the fivemember conservative majority that voted against applying 
the antidiscrimination law to harassment cases consisted of 
kennedy chief justice william h rehnquist and justices sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and byron r white 
kennedy oconnor and scalia are appointees of former president 
ronald reagan and rehnquist was promoted to chief justice by reagan 
the court sent shock waves through the civil rights community in 
april 1988 when it announced it would use a relatively obscure case 
from north carolina to reconsider its 1976 ruling 
while no party to the north carolina case urged the court to 
reconsider the 1976 precedent the justices by a 54 vote took the 
extraordinary step of acting on their own initiative to call for a 
reexamination 
the four dissenters then said that the move threatened to 
undermine the faith minorities have placed in the high court 
the 1976 decision called runyon vs mccrary held that racially 
segregated private schools which refused to admit blacks violate the 
civil rights act of 1866 
that law was intended to ensure recently freed slaves all the 
rights of citizenship 
the 1976 ruling allows civil rights groups to use the 1866 law as 
a weapon to attack private discrimination in all forms 
for example no other federal law bars racially segregated 
private schools also the law provides for heavy punitive damages 
against those found to have practiced discrimination 
that is of particular importance in job bias cases which account 
for some threefourths of the suits filed under the 1866 law 
congress in 1964 outlawed onthejob discrimination but did not 
provide for such heavy penalties 
the 1866 law also is a key recourse for those challeging bias in 
the sale of private homes 
the attorneys general of nearly every state a majority of us 
senators more than 100 house members and more than 100 civil rights 
and public interest groups urged the court not to tamper with its 
1976 ruling 
the north carolina case stemmed from an appeal by brenda 
patterson a black woman who was a teller at mclean credit union 
she sued under the 1866 law seeking actual and punitive damages for 
alleged harassment 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in 1986 upheld a ruling by 
a federal judge in winstonsalem nc throwing out her suit 
the supreme court today agreed with the appeals court and refused 
to revive ms pattersons suit 
in other action the court 
gave some legal help to any man trying to prove he fathered the 
child of a woman married to someone else 
by a 54 vote the justices said states must give such men a 
fair opportunity to prove paternity and seek visitation rights 
shielded states from federal court lawsuits by parents seeking 
to enforce a federal law aimed at assuring adequate education for 
handicapped children 
the justices voted 54 to excuse pennsylvania officials from 
paying a years private school tuition for a student with a learning 
disability 
the case involving the 1866 civil rights law is patterson vs 
mclean credit union 87107

an unusually dry winter had reservoirs in the northeast shrinking 
fast and drought emergency regulations were imposed but since then 
it has rained frequently in record amounts 
now the reservoirs are nearly full theres a bumper crop of 
mosquitoes and some people especially golfers are tired of the wet 
its like walking around in beef stew out there rich 
skyzinski a spokesman for the us golf association said thursday 
of course conditions at the oak hill country club at rochester 
ny where the us open was under way 
there was only a little drizzle on the course thursday after a 
week of heavy rain but the forecast was for more rain at least 
through saturday 
new york city declared a drought emergency in march because an 
unusually dry winter left hardly any snow on the watershed around 
its reservoirs in the catskill mountains the reservoirs dropped to 
55 percent capacity 
but the dry winter was followed by april showers and may 
showers and june showers 
the city had a record 1024 inches of rain in may compared with 
a normal 376 inches measured in central park so far this month 
the total is 669 inches already the 10th wettest june on record 
compared with a normal 323 inches for the whole month the june 
record is 978 inches 
on may 15 the city ended its drought emergency lifting 
restrictions on business use of water and bans on using water for 
lawns flowers and washing cars city reservoirs are now at 971 
percent of capacity 
massachusetts officials announced tuesday that they were easing 
restrictions but stopped short of declaring a formal end to the 
drought emergency for the 25 million people in boston and 43 
surrounding communities that get water from the quabbin reservoir 
since april 1 the huge reservoir which normally gets 35 inches 
of rain monthly has received 18 inches including a record 10 
inches in may 
its unusual to have a wet spring after a dry winter but in 
reality the drought is over said university of massachusetts 
climatologist ray bradley 
a drought warning issued jan 16 for 7 million people in 
delaware new jersey new york and pennsylvania who depend on the 
delaware river basin ended may 12 thanks to the spring rain 
but all that water plus some early warm weather hatched out a 
bumper crop of mosquitoes across new england 
weve got an epidemic said arthur doty chairman of the 
mosquito control district for the vermont towns of brandon 
leicester and salisbury he said the flying bloodsuckers were 
plaguing the region in greater numbers than hed seen in 30 years

captain of the us mens team last year arrived thursday from 
moscow with her daughter to begin a new life in the west 
elena akhmilovskaya had returned to the soviet union from her 
home in seattle on may 26 to arrange an exit visa for dana the 
7yearold daughter from her first marriage 
this couldnt have happened five years ago she said seated 
with her family in the back of a taxi as it drove away from heathrow 
airport even now i couldnt imagine that it would be so easy to 
get every paper and every document 
i think its because our lives in the soviet union have changed 
very much now especially on the political side the side of the 
bureaucracy she said 
before people understood these problems but they couldnt 
help now with perestroika they can ms akhmilovskaya said 
john donaldson a 30yearold international chess master and ms 
akhmilovskaya 32 were secretly married during the chess olympiad 
in salonica greece in november 
donaldson said thursday his first thoughts were for his reunited 
family now i feel good he said the last six months without 
dana have been especially hard for elena 
ms akhmilovskaya had traveled to tblisi the capital of soviet 
georgia to gain the permission of danas father she then went back 
to moscow to arrange the final documents 
the speedy processing of danas passport by the soviet 
authorities will enable her mother to compete in an international 
tournament beginning saturday in britain 
mother and daughter arrived at heathrow with three pieces of 
luggage and a large doll the 7yearold excited by her new 
surroundings exclaimed such shoes such toys such dolls when 
the taxi stopped in front of a line of shops 
the elopement of ms akhmilovskaya a grandmaster who then was 
ranked second among the worlds female players and now rated sixth 
stunned the chess world and came at a crucial time in the 
competition before her dramatic departure ms akhmilovskaya had 
amassed a big score of eight wins and one draw 
with ms akhmilovskaya gone the soviet team managed only a 
finalround draw with the netherlands this enabled hungary to move 
into first place and wine the gold medals in the separate womens 
competition 
in the future ms akhmilovskaya will represent the united states 
when she was in moscow ms akmilovskaya said she was greeted 
with open arms by fellow players including champion garri kasparov

state republican leaders on thursday generally 
backed gop chairman lee atwater who has drawn democratic fire in 
connection with a party memo that likened house speaker thomas s 
foleys record to that of a homosexual lawmaker 
i think everybody agrees it was inappropriate and i think the 
proper action was taken with the resignation of an atwater aide 
and thats the end of it michigan state republican chairman 
e spencer abraham said 
i found absolutely nothing in it that was insulting to 
anybody said perry o hooper gop national committeeman from 
alabama i have found nobody that was concerned 
hooper like several other republicans gathering for the partys 
annual summer meeting said that when he read the memo he 
interpreted it as a description of foleys position on issues not a 
reflection on his personal life 
on the other hand richard m rosenbaum the national 
committeeman from new york said i find what happened to be very 
embarrassing and regrettable 
asked whether the incident would be damaging to atwater 
rosenbaum said i dont know its still a little early to get a 
real consensus 
president bush said in a speech to a party fundraising dinner 
wednesday night that atwater is doing a great job the president 
made no reference to the foley memo 
the memo depicted foley as a liberal and compared his voting 
record to that of rep barney frank dmass an acknowledged 
homosexual mark goodin an aide to atwater resigned after saying 
he wrote the memo which bore the heading tom foley out of the 
liberal closet 
some democrats have asked bush to fire atwater from his party 
post 
jennifer dunn the republican national committeewoman from 
foleys home state of washington said she had received very few 
calls about the memo 
it was a very unfortunate thing but i think it turned into a 
media issue and a democratic issue ms dunn said 
elsie h hillman committeewoman from pennsylvania said i 
guess im very naive i would not if it hadnt been written up and 
hadnt had such a violent explosion i probably would not have made 
any connection with that 
mrs hillman said she believes atwaters position is safe noting 
that the president supports him and has said he believes atwaters 
denial that he knew about the memo 
william m taylor gop committeeman from florida said i dont 
know of anybody who thinks he atwater is in trouble 
it probably shouldnt have been said in retrospect but my 
hindsight is always 2020 taylor said 
abraham who is chairman of the organization of midwestern 
republican state chairmen said his group met thursday and the 
comments were all favorable to atwater 
i think everybody agrees it was inappropriate and i think the 
proper actions were taken and mark goodin resigned and thats the 
end of it the michigan chairman said 
donald b cox national committeeman from indiana said 
republicans in his state were not concerned about the issue and i 
think its more of a washington thing

eighteenyearold detra j of the district of 
columbia saying everyone knows how to get a gun if they want 
one told a house panel thursday that she knows children as young 
as 12 who arm themselves because they are involved in drug 
trafficking 
if they hustle for a person hes a runner or a hit man hes 
getting a gun to carry out the orders the man has given him 
detra whose last name was not revealed told the house select 
committee on children youth and families 
eight people she knows have been shot to death she said adding 
half had guns and were in a gunfight and half of them were 
innocent bystanders 
but the deaths do not keep others from getting involved in the 
drug trade she said most of them after their friends die they 
get deeper into it because of the financial rewards she said 
they get involved because they want fast money to buy cars 
jewelry and radios they dont get legitimate jobs because the pay 
is too low 
detra who works in a local recreation department program to keep 
young people off the streets said everyone knows how to get a 
gun if they want one 
she said many ideas floated by lawmakers to keep young people 
from obtaining guns wont work including making it more difficult 
to buy weapons legally the district of columbia has one of the 
toughest gun control laws in the country yet young people have no 
trouble getting them illegally she said 
holding parents liable for their childrens use of weapons will 
fail because she said theres not too many youth today who talk 
to their parents its not a family bond anymore and parents 
dont have control over their drugdealing children 
two experts who testified differed on the seriousness of 
gunrelated violence 
pediatrician katherine k christoffel of chicago representing 
the american academy of pediatrics said that 10 american children 
ages 18 and under are killed every day in handgun suicides 
homicides and accidents 
three or four times as many are wounded one of every 25 
admissions to american pediatric trauma centers is due to gunshot 
wounds in 1987 gun injuries were the fourthleading cause of 
unintentionalinjury death for children ages 14 and under for 
innercity black adolescent boys and young men firearm injuries are 
the leading cause of death 
but gary kleck an associate professor of criminology at florida 
state university in tallahassee said that accidental shootings of 
innocent bystanders are extremely rare involvement of guns in 
youth suicide has been decreasing since 1979 except for a slight 
upturn in 1984 and 1985 and fatal gun accidents have been declining 
for 20 years 
panel chairman george miller dcalif said kleck had a sense 
of arrogance by failing to recognize the devastating effects gun 
violence has in some sections of the country particularly inner 
cities 
i didnt dismiss such situations kleck responded i 
pointed out the facts that seem to spoil the fun for some people 
he said he supports licensing gun owners following thorough

an army of 20000 construction workers who 
rebuilt this ancient port in four months will do the same for the 
oil town of faw to show the world iraqs peaceful intentions the 
government says 
the reconstruction of basra which is within range of iranian 
artillery and faw which is within rifle range is intended to 
encourage iran to move toward peace president saddam hussein told 
visiting us businessmen last week 
basra iraqs secondlargest city is only 12 miles from the 
iranian border and has become a symbol of iraqs revival after eight 
years of war ended with a ceasefire in august the reconstruction 
was declared finished on wednesday 
as a new city emerged from the rubble iraq also is refurbishing 
and expanding the persian gulf ports khor alzubair and umqasr 
which were closed by the war 
efforts to reopen the shattalarab border waterway iraqs 
outlet to the sea remain stymied by the deadlock in peace talks 
the shatt is formed by the confluence of the tigris and euphrates 
rivers 
dozens of public buildings and schools were built in basra which 
was founded 1400 years ago to replace those destroyed or damaged 
in the war the city has hundreds of miles of new streets and 
sidewalks 
millions of sandbags that protected buildings have been removed 
and the network of canals which gave basra the name venice of the 
east have been dredged the bridges over them have been rebuilt 
hundreds of houses are in ruins the government decreed thursday 
that all damaged houses must be restored within a year or it will 
have the work done and charge the owners 
anwar saeed hadithi mayor of basra described the rebuilding 
campaign as a miracle achieved by determination and hard 
work 
what the iranians took eight years to destroy weve rebuilt in 
four months he said 
most of the 20000 engineers and workers who began the job feb 
16 are moving on to faw with their tent camps and hundreds of 
bulldozers trucks steamrollers and mobile cranes 
the rebuilding of faw on the shattalarab estuary 60 miles 
south of basra is to begin next week iran captured faw in february 
1986 and the iraqis retook it in april 1967 
abdul razak abdul wahab ali head of the port authority said 
work was continuing to clear the stretch of the shatt under iraqi 
control from almaqal basras port to the point several miles 
southwest at which it becomes the border 
scores of ships were trapped in the waterway which was closed in 
the early days of the war and others were sunk 
ali said one hulk the greek cargo ship maria sofia was raised 
last week and several others were being lifted 
iran has rejected iraqi demands that the 120mile shattalarab 
be cleared of wrecked ships unexploded bombs and eight years of 
silt before other provisions of the unsponsored truce agreement 
are implemented

if any firemen are worried about whether they 
are able to grow a beard to participate in the citys centennial 
celebration they can save face by citing a department policy 
beards remain forbidden but the department has relaxed its 
mustache policy to allow neatly groomed handlebar mustaches until 
dec 31 chief doug macdonald has ruled 
a firefighter would have difficulty sealing his air mask when 
wearing a beard macdonald said 
organizers of the 100th anniversary celebration have threatened 
to levy fines against beardless men the chief said no 
firefighters requested permission to grow beards but one or two 
asked if the city would pay the fine 
my response to that was as i understand it its facial hair 
and we have a mustache policy therefore they shouldnt be fined 
mcdonald said 
the chief said he will attempt to come up with a handlebar 
mustache in keeping with his new policy 
police chief fred rainguet has allowed beards but if they dont 
meet his standards the offending officer may be called before a 
beard review board

this was no fiveyear mission as the prologue of the television 
show used to say when dumas was 9 he began to seek out and explore 
the galaxy of toys posters comic books and other spinoffs that 
enterprising business people created for science fiction fans 
fifteen years later the 24yearold stateemployed mapmaker says 
he may have the largest personal stockpile of star trek 
memorabilia on this planet 
i havent found one person who has beaten it dumas said 
he figures he has about 32000 items the most prized being a 
fully operational star trek pinball machine remember the 
handheld communicators kirk and spock used when exploring planets 
dumas has seven as well as a medical scanner like the one used by 
dr mccoy 
dumas has 300 paperback adventures in assorted editions and a 
video library of all but 11 of the 79 tv episodes but he is not 
fond of the secondgeneration star trek television series the 
current movie sequel or the conventions held by trekkers

the price tag is millions more than first 
predicted but a 10month cleanup has removed the last vestiges of a 
radioactive house contaminated decades ago by an enterprising 
professor officials said thursday 
the federal government said thursday that it cost at least 116 
million to tear down the suburban philadelphia house and two 
neighboring garages and haul the contaminated debris along with 
4000 tons of radioactive soil to a burial site for toxic waste in 
utah 
i think thats the end of it said victor j janosik of the 
environmental protection agency were all cleaned up out there 
and were just doing restoration now 
the restoration includes the rebuilding of the two garages and 
driveways also destroyed as the cleanup effort and cost expanded 
at first officials thought they could clean up the site for 
about 2 million but the first written estimate compiled by the epa 
expanded that to 45 million the cost continued to grow as the 
true extent of the contamination became known janosik said 
we anticipated that most of the contamination would be within 
one foot of the soil in places we were going down to as much as 11 
feet janosik said 
contractors began pulling apart the house in august 1988 it was 
contaminated from the mid1920s to the mid40s by a university of 
pennsylvania physics professor who used his basement to pack needles 
with radium for sale to doctors and hospitals the radium needles 
were used to treat cancer 
the house was placed on the epas superfund list in 1985 the 
only private residence to make the list after a cleanup in the 
1960s failed to decontaminate it

the operating rate for us factories continued 
to ease last month the government reported thursday and economists 
said the slower pace so far this year should continue to cool 
inflationary pressures 
the federal reserve said the operating rate in may was 838 
percent 03 percentage points below aprils 841 percent the may 
rate matched the rate in march which had declined 01 percentage 
point from february rates peaked in december and january at 843 
percent a 10year high 
this is telling us that the economy still has plenty of room to 
run and the inflationary pressures are going to be cooling off 
said maury n harris chief economist at paine webber in new york 
the report should relieve concerns about too high a utilization 
leading to inflation agreed s jay levy of levy economic 
forecasts in chappaqua ny adding that the general pattern also 
should erase the fears of a too serious slowdown 
the steady increase in operating rates last year had caused 
economists to worry about accompanying inflationary pressures the 
closer us industry gets to full operating capacity the greater 
difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand leading to 
shortages and price increases 
until recently the fed had been pushing up interest rates in an 
attempt to cool those inflationary pressures without slowing growth 
so much that the economy slides into a recession 
its the slowing operating rate consistent with the feds 
soft landing scenario said economist cynthia latta of data 
resources in lexington mass certainly some of the pressure on 
the productive capacity is easing and that should translate into 
less upward pressure on prices 
last months operating rate of 838 percent was up from 829 
percent a year earlier 
the operating rate fell 03 percentage points to 840 percent at 
manufacturing plants returning to the march operating level prior 
to april the rate had declined since it peaked at 847 in january 
analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or 
above as an indication of inflationary pressures 
the rate at factories producing durable goods big ticket items 
expected to last more than three years fell from 828 percent in 
april to 825 percent in may reflecting decreases in most 
categories 
the rate at factories producing nondurable goods edged down from 
863 percent to 860 percent last month 
in another report thursday the central bank said industrial 
production was unchanged in may after a 06 percent hike in april 
production had edged up 01 percent in march after falling 02 
percent in february the first decline in a year 
the feds industrial production index stood at 1414 percent of 
its 1977 base 39 percent higher than a year ago and the same as 
last months index 
production fell 01 percent at manufacturing plants making both 
durable and nondurable goods 
output at mines and oil wells rose 12 percent following a 10 
percent jump in april the may output was 14 percent higher than a 
year ago 
production at utilities edged down 05 percent after remaining 
flat in may

the first b2 bomber will fly in the next few 
weeks the deputy secretary of defense told congress thursday as he 
defended the 500 million plane 
donald j atwood the no 2 official at the pentagon said 
defense officials remain convinced the b2 is a vital element 
for the nations security as a deterrent the b2 is essential 
he said 
atwood told the senate armed services committee that he and 
defense secretary dick cheney recently visited the heavily secured 
northrop corp plant in palmdale calif where workers are 
assembling the b2 to make sure the project is moving forward 
properly 
the degree of quality control gives me great confidence 
atwood said noting that the radarevading bomber also known as the 
stealth bomber will be constructed with composite materials 
sen sam nunn dga the committees chairman told atwood there 
will be a great temptation in congress to siphon money slated for 
the b2 for other programs that the pentagon wants to eliminate to 
save money in fiscal year 1990 
among the programs cheney wants to kill in the spending year that 
begins oct 1 are the navys f14 tomcat fighter and the marine 
corps v22 osprey aircraft the pentagons proposed purchasing 
program for that year is estimated at 69 billion 
atwood defended terminating some programs while spending money on 
the b2 defense officials have proposed building 132 of those 
bombers eventually making three a month at a cost of 500 million 
each including research and development 
under questioning by nunn and sen james exon dneb atwood 
said the federal government has already committed to spend 224 
billion on the b2 including 155 billion for research and 
development 
when will it fly exon asked 
within the next two to three weeks responded atwood 
nunn also sought assurances the defense department would not use 
money from a revolving contingency fund to correct problems on the 
b1b bomber without informing congress three of the 100 bombers 
already have crashed 
atwood who said the air force estimates it will cost between 
700 million and 800 million to fix the electronic countermeasure 
systems on the b1bs gave nunn the promise the senator wanted 
on other issues atwood said 
the pentagons management study completed at the behest of 
president bush has been sent to the white house it will probably 
be forwarded to congress shortly he said 
defense officials are working with contractors to ensure they 
establish monitoring system designed to counter any fraud or 
corruption the new controls stem from investigation of pentagon 
procurement practices known as the ill wind investigation 
nunn said that once prosecutors have completed their probe 
congress will schedule hearings to look into the purchasing system 
atwood did not know how much longer the ill wind investigation 
will continue 
the investigation began three years ago so far more than a 
dozen people and contractors have either pleaded guilty or been 
convicted in the case

yuri v andropov ignored rampant corruption that 
reached into the kremlin while he headed the kgb under leonid i 
brezhnev a soviet magazine said in the first direct official attack 
on brezhnevs successor 
ogonyok a crusading weekly at the forefront of glasnost also 
quoted an official who alleged that andropov helped josef stalin 
carry out his bloody purges in 194950 
andropov who headed the kgb secret police from 196782 and then 
led the country until his death in 1984 has not been directly 
criticized before in the official press andropov was in some ways a 
mentor of president mikhail s gorbachev who has expanded 
andropovs campaigns for honesty in government and against slackness 
at the workplace 
the only previous indication that andropov might be falling out 
of official favor was an announcement in march that a city would be 
stripped of his name one western diplomat said at the time the 
switch indicated a major change in the leaderships approach to 
andropov even though many current top soviet leaders strongly 
sympathize with andropov 
but it is too early to tell whether the criticism of andropov 
appearing in ogonyok will lead to an official campaign to discredit 
the man who turned the kgb into a modern instrument of espionage 
abroad and repression of dissent at home 
it could just stem from a personal grudge against andropov by the 
man he replaced as kgb chief vladimir y semichastny the source of 
the allegations published in ogonyok semichastny appeared bitter 
that he was removed as kgb chief after six years of service and 
demoted to a party job in the ukraine to make way for andropov 
another element minimizing the criticism was that it was based on 
semichastnys speculation about what andropov should have known or 
done about corruption during the brezhnev era he offered no proof 
that andropov ignored the corruption saying only all those facts 
exist in archives somewhere 
semichastny said andropov had to be aware of what was happening 
in uzbekistan a reference to the widespread corruption that 
plagued the republic he also should have known about wrongdoing in 
the soviet interior ministry where cronyism and bribery were 
reported rampant the former kgb chief told ogonyok 
semichastny also implied andropov did not tell the kremlin 
leadership about the adventures of brezhnevs daughter galina 
about the gypsy about the whole story with this family 
galina brezhnev scandalized moscow with her highrolling 
lifestyle during her fathers reign the soviet press has accused 
her of speculating in diamonds and she has been linked to a bribery 
scandal involving a gypsy performer for the moscow circus 
she is married to yuri churbanov a first deputy interior 
minister fired in 1984 and sentenced in december to 12 years in a 
labor camp for accepting 150000 in bribes 
andropov kept silent along with the rest about the corruption 
because he probably was afraid he would lose his seat on the ruling 
politburo if he came forward with the allegations semichastny said 
he also kept quiet semichastny said because he knew brezhnev was 
friendly with interior minister nikolai a shchelokov who committed 
suicide in december 1984 after investigators began probing his 
conduct 
one of andropovs first major personnel shakeups after coming to 
power was to fire shchelokov reputed to have amassed a collection 
of western cars and to have accepted boxes full of money and jewels 
from uzbek police officials 
after andropov succeeded brezhnev in november 1982 he cracked 
down on corruption and semichastny acknowledged that he then 
followed the right policy but because he was kgb chief during 
brezhnevs rule andropov had to be responsible in his own way for 
what was happening semichastny said 
semichastny also reviewed andropovs early career that began in 
the northern region of karelia he referred to andropovs 
participation in arrests in the region during stalins purges

any man who says he fathered the child of a 
woman married to someone else won limited legal help thursday from a 
supreme court bitterly divided over the significance of 
traditional family relationships 
by a 54 vote the justices said states must give such men a 
fair opportunity to seek visitation rights 
but by a separate 54 vote they said states may deny men the 
chance to file a kind of reverse paternity lawsuit and obtain a 
court declaration of fatherhood 
the court upheld california rulings that denied visitation rights 
to a man identified only as michael h who says he is the father 
of an 8yearold girl victoria born to a woman identified as carol 
d at a time when carol d was married to another man 
at issue was the constitutionality of a california law similar 
to laws in many other states that creates a conclusive presumption 
of paternity in favor of a womans husband if a child is conceived 
and born during their marriage 
the california law has the effect of barring some other man from 
obtaining a court declaration that he and not a womans husband 
is her childs biological father 
four high court members said men in similar circumstances to 
michael h have no constitutional right to a court hearing 
four justices voted to strike down the california law saying 
michael h has a constitutional right to prove his paternity in 
court and seek vistitation rights 
justice john paul stevens casting the controlling ninth vote 
said the california law is valid because it allowed michael h a 
fair opportunity to show that he is victorias natural father that 
he had developed a relationship with her and that her interests 
would be served by granting him visitation rights 
stevens saying he was willing to assume that michael h and 
others in similar circumstances have a right to a judicial hearing 
said the california law does not violate that right because michael 
h received a chance to get visitation rights 
stevens said the law does not have to give michael h a chance to 
have himself declared the biological father 
because i am convinced that the trial judge had the authority 
under state law both to hear michaels plea for visitation rights 
and to grant him such rights if victorias best interests so 
warranted i am satisfied that the california statutory scheme is 
constitutional stevens said 
carol d an international model married gerald d a top 
executive in a french oil company in 1976 
the couple established a home in playa del rey calif and 
victoria was born in 1981 
michael h a neighbor with whom carol d had an affair sued in 
state court in 1982 seeking to have himself declared victorias 
father his lawsuit was dismissed 
in upholding the dismissal a state appeals court said the state 
law presumption that gerald d is victorias father is based upon 
a determination by the legislature as a matter of overriding social 
policy that the husband is to be held responsible for the child 
and the integrity of the family unit should not be impugned 
michael h said he had enjoyed a fatherchild relationship with 
victoria for nearly a year and that blood tests show a 
betterthan98percent chance victoria is his biological daughter 
justice antonin scalia joined by chief justice william h 
rehnquist and justices sandra day oconnor and anthony m kennedy 
wrote that michael h had no constitutional right to establish 
paternity or seek visitation privileges 
our traditions have protected the marital family against the 
sort of claim michael asserts scalia wrote for the four 
but justice william j brennan joined by justices byron r 
white thurgood marshall and harry a blackmun said michael h has 
a constitutional right to establish paternity and seek visitation 
privileges

laboratory studies reported this week indicate 
the aids virus can infect cells in two ways suggesting that 
developing a vaccine against the killer disease may be more 
difficult than previously believed 
a university of california san francisco report to be published 
friday in the journal science says test tube studies prove that the 
human immunodeficiency virus which causes aids can use antibodies 
that normally fight infection to actually cause more aids infection 
instead of helping to kill the virus dr jay a levy a ucsf 
researcher said these type of antibodies provide aids viruses with 
a second way to invade and infect cells 
he said that any vaccine against aids must be designed to not 
cause the body to make these socalled enhancing antibodies 
thats our big warning he said 
levy said the laboratory studies used antibodies derived from 
aids patients he said that like all antibodies these have a 
protein on the surface called fc 
normally an antibody uses this protein to adhere to a 
corresponding protein called the fc receptor on the surface of 
macrophages which are among the white blood cells in the bodys 
immune system when fighting infection the antibody helps the 
macrophage search out and destroy bacteria or viruses in the body 
but levy said the aids virus is able to stick to the fc protein 
on one type of antibody and hitch a ride to a macrophage when the 
antibody locks to the fc receptor the virus slips inside the 
macrophage and takes control the virus turns the macrophage into a 
virusmaking factory that circulates in the body throwing off new 
viruses that then continue the process 
the enhancing antibody allows the virus to enter cells that it 
normally would not said levy this is an important alternate 
route for infection the macrophage is a major cell in the bodys 
immune system 
previously it was wellknown that the aids virus infected 
another immune cell the lymphocyte or tcell by locking onto a 
surface protein called the cd4 receptor 
the new study shows that the virus can use both the fc and the 
cd4 receptor to infect cells and turn them into virusmaking 
factories 
some experimental aids treatments now under way are trying to 
control the infection with injections of a decoy cd4 protein the 
theory is that aids virus would lock onto this decoy instead of the 
cd4 that is actually on a tcell surface 
but levy said the new study shows that blocking the cd4 receptor 
will not be enough to halt spread in the body of the aids virus 
we would have to block both the cd4 and fc receptors for the 
blocking protein strategy to work said levy the tcell he said 
also has fc receptors 
to produce an aids vaccine levy said researchers are going to 
have to find which protein in the aids virus causes the body to 
produce the infectionenhancing antibody that protein then would be 
removed from any candidate aids vaccine he said 
otherwise we could be immunizing people with a viral 
protein he said 
coresearchers in the study with levy were jacques homsy mia 
meyer and masatoshi tateno all of ucsf and sarah clarkson of san 
francisco general hospital 
the study was published in science the journal of the american 
association for the advancement of science

president bush promising to stand up for 
the police officers formally sent congress a 12 billion 
anticrime package thursday proposing tougher sentences for 
gunrelated crimes and construction of more prisons 
praising law officers as domestic freedom fighters bush 
said lets put the handcuffs on the criminals not on the 
criminal justice system 
on the other hand bush said a person suspected of a crime 
should be treated with respect and given his rights or her rights 
even though the evidence looks overwhelming 
bush unveiled his anticrime program a month ago but decided to 
make a special occasion out of the usually routine transmittal of 
the plan to congress 
he flew nearly 1000 miles to southeast georgia to sign the draft 
legislation at the federal law enforcement training center where 
agents and police officers from 60 agencies and every state are 
enrolled 
a crowd of several thousand people mostly students instructors 
and their families waited under a baking sun in muggy weather to 
hear bushs speech 
in the intense heat bush stripped off his suit jacket and 
invited the audience to do likewise 
he placed a wreath at the peace officers memorial to the 39 
graduates of the training center who have been killed in the line of 
duty 
repeating a warning to criminals that he made earlier this year 
at the funeral of murdered drug enforcement administration agent 
everett hatcher in new york bush said better that you had never 
been born than to attack one of americas finest 
we are going after those who kill or wound our police 
officers 
bush noted that sending a bill to congress normally would 
entail nothing more than a quick flourish of the pen and then 
sending an aide on a 10minute car ride to capitol hill 
but when it comes to fighting crime he told the law 
enforcement officers you deserve more than business as usual 
he was applauded loudly as he outlined three of the central 
planks of his anticrime platform doubling to 10 years the mandatory 
term for use of semiautomatic weapons in crimes involving violence 
or drugs eliminating plea bargaining for violent federal firearms 
offenses and an expanded federal death penalty for killers and 
terrorists 
the most costly part of bushs plan calls for spending 1 billion 
for new prison construction in addition to 500 million already 
earmarked for that purpose 
he also proposed hiring 825 new federal agents and staff and 
1600 new prosecutors and staff 
in short i am proposing more law enforcers to catch criminals 
more staff to prosecute them and more prisons to keep them off the 
streets 
bush was cheered when he renewed his pledge to continue a ban of 
imports of semiautomatic weapons 
i am going to stand up for the police officers in this 
country he said 
toward that end he noted he is proposing the prohibition and 
manufacture of gun magazines that hold more than 15 rounds of 
ammunition 
i just dont believe that sportsmen require these 30round 
magazines if the legitimate purpose is sport he said 
however some critics have said bush hasnt been tough enough 
especially on semiautomatic weapons since he has not tried to ban 
sales of domestically produced models 
before his speech bush attended a briefing where he fielded 
questions from several students completing their training 
border patrol agent david rivera of el paso texas asked for 
some words of wisdom as we enter the field 
a word of wisdom would be in spite of the suspicion or 
circumstantial evidence an individual should be treated with 
respect and given his rights or her rights even though the evidence 
looks overwhelming the president said 
i think weve got to stand for that i know that sometimes is 
difficult along the border when you have repeat offenders and you 
have people that are brutally using this narcotics money for 
personal gain and devastating communities

the proceeds from the sale of governmentowned houses obtained 
through mortgage foreclosures 
thornburgh ordered the nations us attorneys to review the 
operation of the propertysale programs in the local and regional 
hud offices within their 94 jurisdictions said david runkel chief 
justice department spokesman 
the increased justice department involvement is something housing 
secretary jack kemp has been actively seeking said mary 
brunette a top aide to the secretary 
she said hud auditors already checking agency operations around 
the country would be involved in every possible aspect of a 
justice department investigation and would be fully cooperative and 
would welcome the assistance 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president 
bush is confident that secretary kemps going to get it hud 
straightened out to turn the management around and cooperate 
fully 
at least three us attorneys already are investigating alleged 
fraud by real estate agents in fort worth texas a federal grand 
jury has charged a real estate agent with stealing 25 million from

has claimed in interviews that she gave most of the money to 
charitable organizations to help the poor 
federal authorities in washington are searching for a local 
attorney who acted as a hud escrow agent before he disappeared last 
year investigators say 3 million may be missing 
four officials in huds washington field office including the 
director were recently placed on leave with pay by kemp 
hud auditors also have been sent to several cities including

supposed to turn over the proceeds of the sales to hud but auditors 
have determined that money is not being returned to the agency

the transportation department is considering 
expanding its drugtesting program to include random checks for 
alcohol abuse among 4 million transportation workers secretary 
samuel skinner told congress thursday 
the transportation secretary also said he would recommend that 
president bush veto a house antidrug bill if passed he said the 
measure which covers only railroad workers would require the 
administration to start over on a drugtesting program it has 
already ordered 
skinner made the announcement on alcohol testing before a senate 
committee considering its version of legislation to require random 
drug and alcohol testing throughout the aviation railroad 
shipping pipeline trucking and mass transit industries 
the transportation department last november ordered drug testing 
programs in private transportation industries beginning at the end 
of this year but the programs face several court challenges the 
supreme court has approved some drug testing but has yet to act on 
random testing 
the proposal to put random testing into law brought general 
support from transportation industry representatives and strong 
objections from groups representing the employees who would be 
tested the senate passed a random testing law in both 1987 and 1988 
but the house failed to accept it 
i have decided that we must step forward and address the issue 
of alcohol misuse in transportation now skinner told the senate 
commerce science and transportation committee 
the secretary said he has directed department lawyers to prepare 
proposed rules that would allow officials to explore what more 
needs to be done and how best to do it 
skinner said a coast guard program of mandatory postaccident 
alcohol testing for the maritime industry begins in december but he 
said testing rules that would cover all of transportation raise 
complex questions and should be drafted carefully 
a lot more thought needs to go into the idea of extending 
random testing to alcohol and i am making it a high priority to get 
needed information he said he noted for instance that alcohol 
is legal while current rules apply to illegal drugs 
skinner said the house version of the antidrug bill would 
mandate random alcohol test rules just 90 days after enactment of 
the bill i look to the long term and i know that to develop a 
program that will achieve its objective and withstand legal 
challenge requires more care and consideration he said 
committee chairman ernest f hollings dsc said alcohol and 
illegal drug use by transporation workers cannot be ignored saying 
that drugs or alcohol caused railroad accidents once every 12 days 
last year 
call it intimidation call it whatever you will he said 
but the fact is that random testing is the only method we have to 
reasonably ensure that transportation employees will not use drugs 
on the job 
rep thomas luken dohio sponsor of the house drug bill said 
skinners decision to explore alcohol testing was a change from his 
departments position that it was not needed 
he said the antidrug bill requiring random testing of railroad 
workers has bipartisan support and said skinner wants antidrug 
measures left to the whims of the transportation secretary 
michael oconnell lawyer for a national association of 
owneroperated heavy trucks said drivers oppose random testing 
because millions of innocent drivers will be victimized by the 
regulations 
oconnell introduced sandy craig of anderson ind who owns and 
drives a single truck with her husband as an example of a driver 
who would be subjected to urine testing possibly in the presence of 
the person conducting the test 
mrs craig interviewed after the hearing said she opposes 
roadside random testing because it would delay her trips and i 
think the procedure proposed is humiliating

sang happy birthday tossed down bubbly and snacks and gave

replica of a silver dollar 
batliner whose workplace is a securitytight room deep in the 
bowels of the famous hotel on union square beamed when reporters 
and cameras recorded the scene like batliner the hotel is also 85 
years old this year 
when the coins come out of the ancient sahara silver burnishing 
machine in use at the hotel since 1936 they are as bright as the 
day they were minted a touch of class the st francis says 
the machine uses buckshot and a special soap compound to wash 
each load for 90 minutes before the coins go into a rinse of boiling 
water are dried recounted and wrapped 
batliner said he enjoys his work reduced to a halfday since he 
was hospitalized a few years ago after a mugging at his doorstep 
im halfretired you can say he chortled 
he said he has one complaint about taking on those dirty coins 
delivered by banks in sacks of 1000 
sometimes theres chewing gum in them he muttered but he 
added with some pride that he never encountered a coin he couldnt

the federal communications commission on 
thursday reaffirmed its decision to allocate to land mobile radio 
service a frequency band that previously had been available to 
amateur radio operators 
the commissions august 1988 action had been appealed by the 
american radio relay league and about 700 other amateur radio 
organizations and individual ham radio operators 
david sumner arrls executive vice president said the league 
plans further appeals in federal court 
the commissions action today is a disappointment but not a 
surprise he said the entire history of this proceeding is one 
of the commission ignoring evidence that did not support its 
preconceived position 
sumner added that now it will be up to the federal court of 
appeals to determine whether by so doing the commission 
overstepped its bounds 
at thursdays meeting the fcc stood by its decision to maintain 
the 216220 mhz band for maritime mobile communications allocate 
the 220222 mhz band which earlier had been available to amateurs 
to land mobile service and allocate the 222225 mhz band 
exclusively to amateur service 
a number of other frequency bands also are currently allocated to 
amateur radio operators 
in affirming the previous action members of the commission said 
they were particularly sensitive to the needs an concerns expressed 
by amateurs particularly their requirements for emergency 
communications 
the commissioners said allocation of the 220222 mhz band to land 
mobile service was driven by the need to provide frequencies for 
development of spectrumefficient land mobile technology 
in other actions thursday the fcc 
proposed amending its rules to permit mobile stations in 
aviation services to use 40 reallocated channels in the 136137 mhz 
band 
the commission called for allotting 20 channels for aeronautical 
en route services and 15 channels for air traffic control purposes 
with the remaining five channels to be held temporarily in reserve 
for future aeronautical advisory and automatic weather observation 
services 
amended its rules to expand the use of mobile service 
frequencies for tone signaling which is used for ripping alarms to 
indicate equipment malfunctions monitoring and changing the 
operational status of equipment as well as detecting intruders and 
hazardous conditions

anatoly karpov of the soviet union 
escaped with a draw against british grandmaster nigel short in a 
ninthround game to maintain his lead in the world cup chess 
tournament thursday 
the outcome caused a sensation among grandmasters watching the 
duel as karpov the former world champion was in a seemingly 
hopeless position when the encounter was adjourned after a 60move 
struggle from a queens gambit on tuesday 
unbelievable shouted yugoslav grandmaster ljubomir 
ljubojevic as he watched the drama unfold on a monitor in the press 
room adjoining the tournament hall karpov has a thousand lives 
short the only player to defeat karpov this year was at a loss 
for an explanation 
seven moves into the resumption i missed a winning 
continuation he said i dont know what came over me i had 
analyzed it so well but karpov took a completely different line 
from what i had prepared 
he played without any threats just coordinating his pieces 
maybe thats why i went wrong short said 
karpov agreed 
nigel should have floored me 10 times over even though it was 
not so easy as some of the others thought he said but when he 
wasted his best chance i could easily even out i was lucky 
the extra halfpoint boosted karpovs score to six points from 
the eight games he has played so far and kept him on top of the 
standings with a halfpoint lead over jan timman of the netherlands 
and britains john nunn who tallied 5 points after nine games 
it also kept alive karpovs chances of catching world champion

civil rights and womens rights advocates 
protesting a series of supreme court decisions they say are turning 
back the clock on racial progress accused the court thursday of 
engaging in redneck justice 
the courts latest ruling although a partial victory for 
minorities touched off a storm of angry rhetoric because it comes 
on the heels of recent decisions erecting roadblocks for 
antidiscrimination efforts 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
said conservatives on the court again revealed themselves to be 
hostile and insensitive to the progress of the last 20 years 
redneck justice meted out with country club manners is no less 
painful than the real thing 
the court by a 54 vote thursday barred the use of a key 1866 
civil rights law to fight racial harassment but the justices 
voting unanimously did uphold use of the law to sue private 
individuals and to fight other forms of discrimination 
john buchanan of the liberal people for the american way said 
its a sad commentary on the state of the courts general outlook 
on civil rights that todays decision must be greeted with a measure 
of relief 
he and others said minorities and women now must turn to congress 
for help 
sen edward m kennedy dmass urged president bush to join 
congress in proposing bills to reverse the high court rulings 
taken separately each of these retreats would be a source of 
genuine concern he said together they are a serious threat to 
the 35 years of progress we have achieved toward a better and fairer 
society 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of a house judiciary 
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights warned that a court 
majority led by appointees of former president reagan intends to 
carry out reagans unfinished agenda to reverse years of 
progress for minorities and women 
edwards said thursdays ruling sends this message to minorities 
be thankful you have a job but too bad if you experience 
discrimination once youre hired 
benjamin hooks and ralph neas of the leadership conference on 
civil rights called the current supreme court term due to end 
within two weeks a disaster for all those committed to equal 
employment opportunity 
julius chambers of the naacp legal defense and educational fund 
said the latest ruling means employers who do not want blacks on 
their work force can simply hire blacks and harass them on the job 
until they quit 
womens rights groups were equally alarmed 
in several rulings a slim majority of the court has turned 
back the clock on advances which so many worked long and hard to 
achieve said marcia greenberger of the national womens law 
center

imre nagy executed as a traitor after 
the antisoviet uprising of 1956 will be reburied as an 
outstanding statesman friday by a new generation of communist 
reformers 
only a year ago before hungarys more liberal leadership changed 
the official view of history police used clubs to break up a 
memorial demonstration 
kiosks did a brisk business thursday in nagy buttons and in 
blackrimmed armbands bearing his picture or 56 on the national 
colors of red white and green 
the city government said all public buildings were to display 
black flags friday 
nagy was premier in 1956 when a popular uprising began oct 23 
and was crushed by soviet tanks on nov 4 he and his close 
associates fled to the yugoslav embassy but later were seized by the 
soviets while traveling outside the embassy with diplomatic escorts 
they were tried and executed in budapest on june 16 1958 
nagys rehabilitation began in february of this year when the 
communist party leadership decided the antisoviet revolt began with 
a popular uprising and was not a counterrevolution after all 
exiled survivors of the military crackdown and reprisals returned 
to budapest for fridays funeral many for the first time 
bela kiraly who commanded the paramilitary national guard under 
nagy and now lives in new jersey said it was hard to believe he was 
in budapest with my past for the first time in 33 years 
he declared to journalists nagys leadership was absolutely 
right that the liberal changes made then were an absolute total 
victory and the bastions of the old regime were wiped out 
asked whether he thought the leaders of 1956 were ahead of their 
time in trying to meet the peoples demands for more democracy 
kiraly replied we were behind the times because changes were due 
in 1945 before the communist party had consolidated power 
kiraly said the revolt was an expression of popular will and 
would have continued if the soviets had not intervened 
a commemorative plaque was unveiled thursday at the budapest 
prison where nagy and the others were held 
most newspapers and periodicals carried articles documents and 
photographs about the uprising nagys picture was on the cover of 
several magazines 
womens journal the most popular weekly put a painting by 
caravaggio called burial on its cover it portrays a christlike 
figure being borne by mourners 
at heroes square a platform was built on the steps of the art 
museum for coffins bearing the remains of nagy and four of his 
associates and an empty one symbolizing all who perished 
among those paying last respects will be a government delegation 
led by premier miklos nemeth 
one year ago friday on the 30th anniversary of the executions 
police with motorcycles and truncheons dispersed protesters who 
gathered on the steps of the state television building demanding 
democracy and nagys rehabilitaion 
at a news conference with government leaders wednesday members 
of the independent youth group known by its initials fidesz asked 
about last years events in the light of the changed official view 
foreign minister gyula horn responded that no one in the 
central committee could have known one year ago what would happen 
and the conclusions that would lead to 
about 200 people from a branch of the youth group protested 
outside the soviet embassy on thursday demanding withdrawal of 
soviet forces from hungary they chanted russians go home and 
carried banners with such slogans as there is a limit to our 
hospitality 
a hungarian government statement wednesday expressed sympathy for 
families who suffered in the national tragedy and said 
the government wishes to do everything possible to make sure no 
one shall ever again be sentenced in order to serve political 
preconceptions and without legal basis 
two weeks after the communist party said nagy was a symbol of 
reform policies the government statement described him as an 
outstanding statesman 
on the day preceding the funeral the government reaffirms that 
its greatest aim is to contribute to national reconciliation and the 
creation of a social consensus for the betterment of the nation 
the statement said 
a poll of 276 people in budapest published by the weekly 
magazine hvg said only 1 percent agreed with the execution of nagy 
onefifth of those questioned said they felt he deserved some 
punishment but 74 percent said he never should have been tried

defense secretary dick cheney has ordered an 
internal attack on budget gimmicks used by the pentagon to make its 
fiveyear spending plan seem small enough to confirm to president 
bushs decisions a pleased congressional critic disclosed thursday 
the special review is expected to slash at least 45 billion from 
the spending projections for the fiscal years 1990 through 1994 
even though the bush administration already has agreed to cut 
pentagon budget requests by 65 billion during the period 
the two figures are not additive the 45 billion in projected 
cuts would offset elimination of the accounting tricks without 
changing the fiveyear total 16 trillion 
cheneys order was disclosed by rep andy ireland rfla in a 
letter he released from the general accounting office updating the 
results of a critical study presented to congress on may 10 
the gao update states that cheney has ordered a program 
execution review with the objective of elimination of negative 
planning wedges in the fiveyear defense plan and close 
consideration of the affordability of currently proposed major 
weapons programs 
the socalled negative planning wedges are deductions used to 
balance some 45 billion worth of spending requests that exceed the 
bush administrations latest fiveyear plan 
for example the pentagon plan currently contains a negative 
figure of 217 billion derived from its historical experience that 
2 percent or 3 percent of procurement funds ultimately are not spent 
because of program changes gao said this deduction should not be 
included 
while the special review involves annual budgets that would 
undergo extensive revision in any case before finally being 
submitted to congress it is nonetheless significant because it 
could force the immediate demise of programs that the military 
wanted to keep alive on its wish list 
ireland hailed cheneys move saying the defense chief was 
showing a real commitment to bringing pentagon spending into line 
with fiscal reality 
while secretary cheney makes fundamental changes in the 
pentagons planning process congress also needs a healthy dose of 
selfdiscipline and foresight ireland added 
congress must put aside parochial concerns and focus only on 
those programs that contribute to a strong and efficient national 
defense 
the gao study released last month strongly castigated the defense 
department for providing congress a fiveyear defense plan that 
might be close to being worthless charles bowsher the head of 
the agency said the plan would require at least 147 billion more 
than the pentagon conceded would be needed 
especially troubling bowsher testified was the fact the 
pentagons spending plan exceeded president bushs own budget plan 
by 45 billion 
bowsher told the panel that since the mid1980s the 
departments fiveyear defense planning has been fiscally 
unrealistic more weapons were being planned and developed than 
could be produced in an economic manner or supported once they were 
produced 
congress has approved 2902 billion in spending authority for 
the pentagon this fiscal year and is expected to approve a request 
of 2956 billion for fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1

boy like me he said

the us embassy in beijing and four other 
consulate offices in china granted visas thursday to more than 100 
chinese to go to the united states the state department reported 
another 114 applicants were turned down for a variety of reasons 
the most likely one being that they apparently intended to use 
temporary visas to try to remain permanently in this country 
additionally 350 applicants were asked to return to us 
diplomatic offices to have their situations reviewed many of them 
were sent home because us officials did not have enough time to 
interview them by the end of the day 
the visas were issued by the us embassy in beijing and the 
consulates in shanghai guangzhou chengdu and shenyang the embassy 
and the shanghai consulate had suspended processing while assisting 
americans in leaving china and then resumed on wednesday 
almost all the visas approved were for brief stays they required 
the approval of chinese authorities who issued exit permits and a 
knowledge of english 
an exact count was not available because the beijing embassy 
reported that of 138 applicants interviewed on thursday a 
majority were approved 
in shanghai 62 were approved in gunagzhou formerly canton 15 
in shenyang ll and in chengdu 2 
there were no reports of interference with applicants by chinese 
security forces posted outside the us diplomatic offices 
but dissidents and other prodemocracy advocates sought by 
chinese authorities were unlikely to apply they either would be 
apprehended by security forces or denied the required exit permits 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the embassy 
and consulates would process as many applicants as show up the 
staff at the embassy and the consulates was not reduced even though 
other americans were urged to leave china 
there were no figures on how many applications were approved on

agencys plan to rid public housing of drug dealers and users 
key provisions would speed drugrelated evictions and seize 
apartments of alleged dealers and users those elements have been 
criticized by tenants rights groups as not providing adequate legal 
protection for the accused 
as we aggressively pursue our objectives to eradicate drugs 
from our housing programs we will not do so at the expense of 
individual tenants rights he added in a written statement 
he said his department of housing and urban development is 
reviewing each states judicial structure as it relates to eviction 
to ensure individual rights are protected 
hud has granted exemptions from the agencys administrative 
grievance procedures in evictions of alleged drug dealers and users 
in public housing in virginia massachuestts new york and the 
district of columbia 
public housing managers said federal regulations which required 
local government officials to allow tenants threatened with eviction 
to appeal to agency administrative panels and then to courts slowed 
evictions by as much as a year 
rep nita lowey dny questioned how he would envision 
handling the case of the possible eviction of a single mother or 
grandmother living in public housing with a drugselling teenager 
she feared 
you cannot have one policy that will cover every single 
condition in public housing kemp said adding eviction actions 
would have to be reviewed on a casebycase basis 
however kemp said he wanted to give public housing authorities 
the power to to remove the guilty and protect the needy 
kemp also cited the rehabilitation act of 1973 as legislation 
that has hampered his antidrug efforts 
the law makes it illegal for any recipient of federal money to 
discriminate based on mental and physical impairments and 
includes drug and alcohol dependent persons among those defined as 
being legally handicapped 
as a result kemp said public housing which gives priority to the 
disabled would have to include such people 
in my view the drug user should not be put at the top of the 
waiting list for public housing said kemp 
sen dan coats rind has introduced legislation to exclude 
drug addicts and alcoholdependent persons from those protected by 
the 1973 law 
other aspects of huds plan plan for drugfree public housing 
would tighten security reclaim vacant units and deny access to drug 
dealers encourage resident management and homeownership establish 
an antidrug hotline at hud for residents to anonymously report 
drugrelated activities terminate housing assistance of those 
convicted of drug crimes and provide money for athletic programs in 
public housing 
kemp offered no figures on the total cost of the program 
meanwhile sen barbara mikulski dmd head of the 
appropriations subcommittee on hud and independent agencies told a 
meeting of the council of large public housing authorities the 
secretarys antidrug effort was initiated to show that the 
government wanted to be a good landlord 
the point has been made now the point has to be turned into 
dollars she said

a moscow cinematographer named victor sober 
now for nine months says hes undergoing a personal perestroika 
thanks to the small but growing fellowship of alcoholics anonymous 
in the soviet union 
perestroika is a very popular word now in my country he 
said referring to soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
restructuring the soviet economy we alcoholics can restructure 
ourselves and become better happier persons i am rebuilding my 
life 
victor 42 who followed aa tradition in asking that his last 
name not be used is among three recovering soviet alcoholics who 
are ending a twomonth tour of the united states they held a news 
conference thursday at the national press club 
since they arrived april 10 in new york victor and his 
companions sasha 43 and volodya 37 have attended scores of aa 
meetings from massachusetts to texas visited alcoholism treatment 
centers and met with such celebrities as betty ford and kitty 
dukakis who also are recovering alcoholics 
on monday they met with president bushs physician dr burton 
lee at the white house theyll end their tour this weekend in 
atlanta with a side trip to plains ga where they will attend a 
sunday school class led by former president carter 
the tour was organized by the rev jw canty an episcopal 
priest from new york who is chairman of the nonprofit sovietus 
joint conference on alcoholism drug addiction and peace in moscow 
canty who helped start the first aa meeting in the soviet 
capital in august 1987 told reporters that aa would have to 
function underground if it werent for the new freer attitudes 
under gorbachevs reform policies 
the moscow beginners group of aa has about 40 members who 
meet seven nights a week at various spots in the soviet capital 
small groups active in other soviet cities bring total aa 
membership to fewer than 100 canty said 
its very small but its a beginning canty said its 
working slowly but well if you can save even one life thats an 
enormous contribution 
alcoholics anonymous a 12step program of recovery that stresses 
spiritual growth and mutual support among members who share their 
experience strength and hope claimed about 835500 members in 
the united states last year and more than 15 million members 
worldwide 
canty went to moscow in 1985 shortly after gorbachev took office 
and began a strict antialcoholism campaign the communist party 
newspaper pravda estimated in november 1987 there are more than 45 
million registered alcoholics in the soviet union with 1 million of 
them requiring compulsory care 
canty said the actual number of soviet alcoholics probably ranges 
from 10 million to 15 million he said his efforts to encourage the 
growth of alcoholics anonymous in that country have been made easier 
by the personal support of gorbachev and his wife raisa who 
showed great interest in our work 
the times and locations of aa meetings are routinely announced 
on governmentrun tv and radio broadcasts a gorbachev aide once 
informed canty that the soviet leader had read all the 
russianlanguage aa pamphlets circulated by cantys office 
volodya a moscow factory machinist who drank two bottles of 
vodka every day until he got sober 16 months ago said alcoholics 
still suffer a painful stigma in the soviet union 
they are treated like the worst human beings he said while 
in america they know it is a disease that is treatable and even 
famous people can confess to being recovering alcoholics

mikhail s gorbachev who is determined 
to reform the soviet union said thursday it may be dangerous for 
the world if reform stops in china the other communist giant 
i think all of us are very much concerned at what is happening 
in china he said all of us want the process of deep reform not 
to fail in such a large nation 
that failure would be very dangerous for the entire process of 
creating a healthy environment in the world the soviet president 
told a news conference at the end of a fourday visit to west 
germany 
gorbachev expressed concern about events in china and said 
without being specific that his government regretted some aspects 
of what happened 
the comments were his most extensive on the subject since the 
congress of peoples deputies in moscow passed a cautiously worded 
resolution after the military crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators in beijing two weeks ago 
he praised at least some of the students who he said wrote him 
an interesting letter but he made no mention of the violence used 
on them 
estimates of the number of people killed range from a few hundred 
by the government to about 3000 by chinese witnesses and western 
intelligence 
when asked whether he shared the official chinese view that the 
students were counterrevolutionaries gorbachev did not reply 
directly the soviet leader recalled that during a visit to beijing 
last month after a 30year rift with china he said dialogue was the 
way to resolve problems 
after he left the situation became rather grave he said 
i dont think we have full information on which to make an 
assessment and that dictated his balanced serious position on 
china he said 
gorbachev said he received letters in which chinese students 
spoke out for reform 
i cannot suspect these people of any evil intention he said 
but there could be elements that took advantage of the 
situation 
he did not elaborate

voters in britain ireland denmark the 
netherlands and spain chose european parliament members thursday 
after election campaigns dominated by national rather than 
paneuropean issues 
in other european economic community nations belgium france 
greece italy luxembourg portugal and west germany voting takes 
place sunday 
official results of thursdays balloting will not be announced 
until voting ends in the other countries sunday night in denmark 
the vote count begins monday morning 
a total of 7126 candidates are vying for seats in the 518member 
parliament which meets one week a month in strasbourg france 
contenders represent 178 national parties of every political 
persuasion 
unofficial projections on thursdays balloting offered a mixed 
picture 
a british opinion poll saw prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative party losing four to 10 of its 45 seats getting 38 
percent of the vote against 42 percent for the opposition labor 
party which has 33 seats 
labor turned the election into a referendum on mrs thatchers 10 
years in power at a time when conservative support is at its lowest 
since she won a third fiveyear term in 1987 people are concerned 
about high inflation and interest rates 
mrs thatcher sees planned european community legislation as a 
threat to the freemarket revolution she is carrying out in england 
with mixed results 
in the netherlands an exit poll projected prime minister ruud 
lubbers christian democrats will win two more seats from their 
conservative coalition partners giving them a total of 10 seats 
the conservatives now hold five seats labor party would retain its 
nine seats according to the poll 
spain was out of step with the general trend polls there showed 
the socialist party of prime minister felipe gonzalez could lose as 
many as four of its 28 seats conservative and centrist opposition 
parties also were expected to post slight losses leaving them a 
half dozen seats while the communistled united left coalition was 
seen winning 5 seats up from 3 
spanish opposition parties see the election as a litmus test for 
general elections to be held by june 1990 
opinion polls predict balloting in all 12 member nations will 
boost socialists who with 166 seats already are the largest faction 
in the assembly and centrist christian democrats who hold 112 
seats 
green parties concerned with the environment hold 20 seats and 
are expected to do well notably in west germany and france 
voting in ireland coincided with national elections as will be 
the case sunday in luxembourg and greece 
especially in these nations campaigns have highlighted national 
rather than european issues such as the plan to remove the 
communitys internal borders and create a single market by dec 31 
1992 
the european parliament is one of three institutions directly 
involved in the communitys lawmaking process it must be consulted 
on single market issues involving the environment research and 
technology occupational health and safety 
it also approves some treaties with other countries and 
applications for membership

the provision in president bushs cleanair 
package to require use of cleanfuel cars could boost corn prices as 
much as 15 cents a bushel an ethanol industry group said thursday 
production of ethanol which is made from corn would rise from 
850 million gallons to 11 billion gallons a year the nations 
current production capacity the renewable fuels association 
estimates 
were real encouraged by that sen tom daschle dsd a 
leading advocate in congress of alternative fuels said in an 
interview i personally feel that estimate is quite 
conservative 
the cleanair program bush unveiled monday would require the sale 
of a million cleanfuel cars in the nations nine most polluted 
areas by 1997 
those cars which would be powered by methanol ethanol or 
natural gas would produce fewer of the chemicals that cause ozone 
pollution 
generally were very pleased with the presidents 
announcement said bob dinneen legislative director for the 
renewable fuels association we think that it will greatly enhance 
the potential for increased production and use of ethanol 
general motors officials recently told congress they are prepared 
to recommend the use of ethanol in their automobiles as early as 
next year daschle said 
the automobile companies have seen this coming for some time 
and theyre prepared to address the challenge a lot more effectively 
than we might otherwise give them credit daschle said

a military judge gave four soldiers 
prison terms of up to nine months thursday for the beating of a 
palestinian who later died and he called on the army to have the 
courage to look in the mirror 
the judge col emanuel gross urged the military to bring to 
trial officers who gave illegal orders that extended army policy of 
beating palestinians who were rioting to include those who were 
arrested 
the case focused national attention on the beating policy which 
drew fire from foreign governments and human rights organizations 
after beatings by soldiers appeared on television newscasts abroad 
also thursday a 46yearold man in the gaza strip was fatally 
stabbed by fellow palestinians who accused him of collaborating with 
israeli authorities israel radio and arab sources said 
sixteen palestinians were reported shot and wounded in clashes 
with soldiers in the gaza strip and west bank including a 
12yearold boy shot in the pelvis in the shati refugee camp in gaza 
shlomo franco 42 an israeli cameraman for the us tv network 
abc was shot in the face with a plastic bullet by soldiers 
dispersing palestinian rioters in ramallah west bank he was 
reported in good condition 
the four members of the elite givati brigade were convicted of 
brutality on may 25 but acquitted of manslaughter doctors testified 
the 42yearold victim hani shami died not from their blows but 
from a later beating by other unidentified soldiers 
gross urged prosecutors to try officers who issued the beating 
orders saying there wont be any value to this trial if we dont 
do anything to enforce the law we have to have the courage to look 
in the mirror 
the army has said it did not plan to bring charges against the 
brigade commander but did not make clear if it intended to charge 
other officers 
gross said the affair exposed in this case symbolizes perhaps 
a breakdown in values which if continued would endanger the basic 
values that are the true cultural heritage of our country 
after thursdays sentencing a brawl erupted outside the 
courtroom when one defendant pvt ron hakhel 20 lunged at 
photographers and tv camera crew 
the defendants and several of their friends including a military 
policeman brawled with photographers for almost 10 minutes one 
photographer emerged with a swollen eye 
hakhel pvt yitzhak kibbudi 20 and 1st sgt yitzhak adler 21 
were sentenced to serve nine months in prison and given additional 
ninemonth suspended sentences and two years probation 
pvt ariyeh luchato 20 was given six months in prison six more 
months suspended and six months probation the ruling noted he 
participated in only part of the beating 
the beating was administered after the victim was arrested last 
aug 22 in the gaza strips jabaliya refugee camp 
in arab east jerusalem thursday police seized files and papers 
from a news service office run by palestinian activist sari 
nusseibeh whom israel has accused of being the palestine liberation

ambassadorial nominee donald gregg under 
intense questioning by senate democrats did not waver thursday from 
his insistence that he didnt know at the time about oliver l 
norths secret efforts to resupply nicaraguan rebels 
gregg who served as thenvice president bushs national security 
adviser said that when he finally learned in december 1986 that his 
associate former cia agent felix rodriguez had been recruited to 
help in norths operation he felt betrayed 
i was furious at north i felt very let down by felix and i 
faulted myself for not putting the pieces together gregg told the 
senate foreign relations committee which is weighing his nomination 
to be ambassador to south korea 
greggs story given under oath did not shift in any major 
respect from his testimony at an initial hearing last month 
but democrats insisted that gregg could and should have known of 
rodriguezs involvement with north months earlier than he has 
admitted and that he should have alerted bush 
they repeatedly challenged greggs credibility and said his 
alleged lack of judgment disqualifies him for confirmation as an 
ambassador 
meanwhile sen charles robb dva became the first committee 
democrat to say he may vote for gregg 
robb said through a spokeswoman that barring evidence of lying 
or perjury he is leaning toward confirmation 
he wants to review all of the evidence and he plans to make a 
conscientious decision said julia sutherland robbs press 
secretary 
sen alan cranston dcalif spearheading the gregg probe 
complained that the bush administration inadequately responded to a 
request for documents and declared we are being stonewalled by 
the administration 
but sen mitch mcconnell rky greggs chief defender on the 
panel said the administration responded fully and quickly and said 
of the investigation it is in fact trying to harm the president 
i think don has submitted to intense questioning and held up 
very well mcconnell said 
sen larry pressler rsd told gregg it seems to me we have 
now shifted from you having done something wrong to your being 
wrong in judgment i think these hearings will have a reverse effect 
and you will be confirmed as ambassador i do not think these 
hearings have uncovered any wrongdoing 
a vote on the nomination will be held tuesday and committee 
members said it is likely to be close 
rodriguez was sent to el salvador in 1984 with greggs help to 
assist the salvadoran government to quell a leftist insurgency 
gregg contends he had no inkling until august 1986 that rodriguez 
had been recruited to assist norths nicaraguan contra resupply 
operation 
all he knew then he testified was that rodriguez told him that 
unidentified gunrunners were ripping off the contras and 
should be stopped 
felix told me that north had somehow put the gunrunners and the 
contras together gregg said 
but he said he had discounted rodriguezs characterization of the 
situation as a potential watergate because he was not told 
enough to realize the dimensions of the situation 
gregg said he did not put what he knew into context until 
four months later when he learned of the extent of norths operation 
but cranston said gregg was literally surrounded by people who 
knew about the resupply operation and rodriguezs role in it 
youre trying to convince us of an elaborate conspiracy to 
prevent you from knowing cranston said 
why didnt you know cranston asked 
i dont think everybody did know from the outset gregg 
replied 
gregg said that as the involvement of north and rodriguez became 
clear in december 1986 he twice offered to resign from bushs vice 
presidential staff and bush refused to accept the resignations 
much of the testimony centered on norths heavily censored 
notebooks cranston said north hasnt complied with a subpoena for 
versions of his notebooks which he said contain repeated january 
1985 references to felix rodriguez which suggest norths involvement 
in rodriguez briefings of the vice president 
notes made available to the congressional irancontra committees 
contain brief mentions of rodriguez and indications of a meeting 
with bush but other parts were blacked out 
sen john kerry dmass said an uncensored look at norths 
notes might clear up much of the mystery and said im willing to 
vote for don gregg if we get the notebooks for these particular 
days 
but other senators pointed out that gregg does not control 
norths notes and that north and his lawyers have resisted demands 
they be made available in uncensored form

doctors may ethically counsel women to reject 
aggressive medical treatment during pregnancy if their newborns are 
very likely to die or have severe brain damage contends a report in 
a medical journal 
aggressive treatments such as monitoring the fetus using drugs 
to stop premature labor and delivering the baby by caesarean section 
are often used in cases involving severely defective fetuses the 
report said 
using those treatments without telling the mother that doing 
without them is a reasonable option may violate her decisionmaking 
rights said the report published in fridays journal of the 
american medical association 
the report describes the outcome of 13 pregnancies in which women 
chose nonaggressive management of their cases nine of the babies 
were stillborn and two died within a month of birth the report said 
one child with serious chromosome abnormalities died at age 4 
and another with a usually fatal disorder of the skeletal system 
remains alive at 26 months though dependent on a respirator the 
report said 
it said choosing nonaggressive treatment should depend on two 
criteria virtual certainty in the diagnosis and a very high 
probability that death or severe and irreversible brain damage will 
occur in the newborn 
recent advances in diagnosis permit the detection of a wide 
variety of fetal problems said the report by dr frank a 
chervenak of new york hospitalcornell medical center and laurence 
b mccullough of baylor college of medicine in houston 
the information usually leads to either aggressive treatment or 
abortion they said 
many fetuses with severe abnormalities face a high probability of 
death immediately after birth even with the most intensive care 
the authors said 
such intensive care often involves levels of physiciancaused 
disease injury pain and suffering that can reasonably be judged 
to outweigh any benefits they said 
an accompanying editorial largely agreed with the authors in 
their view that the wishes of the mother should be the main 
consideration 
the editorial by dr frederick r abrams of the university of 
colorado graduate school of public affairs said fairness demands 
that in a situation in which there is a wide divergence of values 
and no universally accepted source of truth we ought to respect 
patient autonomy

a top state department official under heavy 
congressional criticism for not offering more help to americans 
during the crisis in china apologized thursday but said no one 
could have foreseen the violence that resulted from student 
demonstrations in beijing 
of course we are not satisfied when we hear that major foulups 
took place said richard l williams acting deputy assistant 
secretary for east asian and pacific affairs we are sorry 
congressman 
williams was responding to rep ted weiss dny one of half a 
dozen lawmakers who took the department to task for not moving 
faster to evacuate americans following the tiananmen square 
massacre weiss said the department and embassy had exhibited an 
aloof attitude that angered citizens seeking help 
meanwhile a senior administration official said the turmoil in 
china does not necessarily mean the country has turned its back on 
economic and political reforms moreover the official suggested the 
united states still could do business with supreme leader deng 
xiaoping despite the military crackdown and massacre of hundreds 
perhaps thousands of people 
he is the head of a very major country there are lots of heads 
of government and state who do things that we dont like that we do 
business with said the official briefing a group of reporters on 
condition of anonymity 
are you suggesting we should not have done any business with 
soviet leaders nikita khrushchev leonid brezhnev anybody who 
has done anything wrong the official asked 
saying it was premature to say china has abandoned reforms the 
official added it is not so clear that they have made a major 
reversal in course and will not resume a path like they were on 
before 
on capitol hill lawmakers pummeled the state department with 
complaints about the way it reacted to the crisis in china 
frantic parents called my office with desperate pleas for help 
in getting their sons and daughters out of china said rep howard 
berman dcalif who said his staff booked flights for students 
if we were able to make these arrangements from los angeles why 
couldnt the state department provide such assistance 
rep rod chandler rwash citing a case in his congressional 
district said the state department has denied visas to chinese 
grandparents who sought to bring grandchildren who are us citizens 
to the united states 
it is clear to me that the way we deal with the evacuations of 
us citizens in a crisis especially us children needs to be 
carefully reevaluated chandler said 
in a crisis in which the lives of us citizens are in danger 
i believe protection of americans must be the highest priority 
clearly this was not the case in china this month 
chandler and others said it was simply luck that no americans 
were killed or seriously wounded in the violent aftermath of the 
june 34 crackdown on student prodemocracy protests 
williams described efforts by the embassy to provide 
transportation for americans to airports but rep elton gallegly 
rcalif said one of his constituents seeking help was told by a 
diplomatic official that the consulate is not in the taxi 
business 
williams claimed success for the evacuation effort noting that 
more than 6000 americans had left china over the last week in one 
of the largest evacuations of americans in a crisis situation since 
world war ii about 1000 americans remain along with 182 us 
government personnel he said 
but under questioning from rep olympia snowe rmaine williams 
conceded that the us embassy in beijing did not advise americans 
to leave china until june 6 three days after the crackdown started 
and well after embassies of other countries had alerted their 
nationals to the danger 
we had a period of time where we were deciding what seemed the 
best thing to do said williams explaining that officials feared 
evacuating americans in remote rural areas would expose them to more 
danger as they passed through urban areas to airports than if they 
simply remained where they were 
he said that with some 8800 americans in the country the 
embassy had a vastly greater number of people to help than did 
other countries 
mrs snowe said the state department really didnt have a plan 
in place to cope with the emergency she acknowledged it was 
difficult to anticipate the violence but added ultimately we 
should have gotten the drift that something was going awry 
williams appeared at the hearing only under an agreement that he 
would not be asked about the handling of the case of prominent 
dissident fang lizhi who with his wife was granted refuge at the 
us embassy following the violence the gesture and a warrant 
later issued by the government for fangs arrest has heightened 
uschinese tensions 
it just would not be helpful to the situation for me to 
comment on that case williams said

the government said thursday it fears 
the 45000 soldiers india sent to help end an ethnic civil war are 
on the island to stay despite the presidents request that they 
leave 
it is regretted certain statements have been made both here and 
abroad to support the continued presence of the indian troops in sri 
lanka a foreign ministry statement said 
such pronouncements will only have the unfortunate effect of 
confirming the fears in the minds of the people of sri lanka that 
indian troops have come to this country to remain and not to 
return it added 
prime minister rajiv gandhi of india said wednesday the soldiers 
could not leave until terms of the 1987 indiasri lanka peace 
agreement were met primarily granting local autonomy to the tamil 
minority 
gandhi said wednesday his country has a responsibility for the 
safety of tamils in sri lanka where they make up 18 percent of the 
16 million people tamils who are predominantly hindu like indias 
population claim discrimination by the majority sinhalese most of 
whom are buddhists 
gandhis government has said it does not want the soldiers to 
remain permanently in sri lanka which is just off the southern tip 
of india but has made clear there will not be a hasty withdrawal 
according to the foreign ministry statement the only requirement 
for withdrawal under the pact is a request by sri lanka and the one 
made by the president of sri lanka to the prime minister of india 
has already satisfied this condition 
president ranasinghe premadasa who took office in january has 
said the indians should leave by july 29 the second anniversary of 
the peace agreement 
the accord signed by gandhi and former president junius r 
jayewardene provided for deployment of indian troops to supervise 
the surrender of arms by tamil rebels who began fighting in 1983 
for an independent nation in northern and eastern sri lanka 
it promised the rebels limited autonomy in exchange but failed 
when the largest tamil militia refused to go along 
india became involved because it is the regions major power and 
has 60 million tamils of its own 
india has said premature withdrawal would lead to even greater 
violence in a nation where ethnic strife has claimed 12500 lives in 
six years 
at least 9000 people have been killed in the tamil war and about 
3500 most of them supporters of the government by sinhalese 
extremists who oppose any concessions to tamils

billion for veterans programs including health care however

austria has asked the united states to lift its 
ban on visits by president kurt waldheim but our position hasnt 
changed a us official said thursday 
the united states bans waldheim because of his complicity in nazi 
war crimes during world war ii said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity and we received a communication from the 
austrian embassy asking if we could reconsider his status 
our position hasnt changed the official added and a 
response to that effect will be given to the austrian government 
the united states decided in april 1987 to place waldheim who 
was secretary general of the united nations in the 1970s on its 
socalled watch list of undesirable visitors 
the austrian embassy confirmed it had conveyed a note from its 
foreign ministry to the state department but denied it had asked 
that waldheim be removed from the watch list 
we simply reiterated our view that his being placed on the list 
contravenes international law said embassy spokesman ulf pacher 
president bush said when he was running for the white house last 
year that he supported the reagan administrations decision to bar 
waldheim who served as an intelligence officer in the german army 
in the balkans 
chancellor franz vranitsky who heads austrias socialist party 
told reporters here last month that he did not raise the waldheim 
matter in talks with bush and other us officials during a visit 
foreign minister alois mock is a leader of austrias conservative 
peoples party with which waldheim was allied 
an international commission of historians appointed by the 
austrian government issued a report in february 1988 that said 
waldheim was in close proximity to some war atrocities knew 
they were going on and made no attempt to stop them 
the justice department said it has evidence that shows waldheims 
complicity in the deportation of jews from greek islands under 
german occupation to nazi concentration or death camps as well as 
the execution of allied prisoners

the senate opened debate thursday on a 
multibilliondollar childcare package revised to accommodate 
various republican concerns but still opposed by president bush 
this package embodies a truly bipartisan and comprehensive 
approach to this nations childcare crisis said sen christopher 
dodd dconn coauthor of major elements of the legislation 
its not a complete answer but its a very solid beginning 
the centerpiece of the package is a revised version of dodds 
proposed act for better child care a 175 billion program 
including subsidies to poor families and grants and loans to 
encourage establishment of new and expanded childcare centers 
tacked onto the measure was a separate set of tax credits for 
poor families drafted by sen lloyd bentsen dtexas and a 
provision designed to make clear the legislation was not aimed at 
eliminating churchbased child care 
also included is an amendment unrelated to child care that would 
delay the implementation of a law requiring business to test benefit 
programs for discrimination business interests have been lobbying 
heavily for the delay and by attaching it to the child care package 
democrats hope to increase support among republicans 
indeed several key republican senators endorse the thrust of the 
package although they disagree with certain elements but senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas was not among them and said he 
would fight to quash dodds financing approach in favor of a 
bushsupported measure relying almost exclusively on tax credits 
this is a necessity dole said it is a high priority with 
the president it is a high priority with the administration but we 
believe there is a better way to go 
dole said he hoped to sway democrats during what likely will be 
several days of debate and dozens of attempts to amend the measure 
democrats said they would negotiate with the administration but were 
committed to having the abc framework in the final bill 
the compromise version of dodds bill cosponsored by sen orrin 
hatch rutah leaves virtually all regulatory decisions at the 
state level federal regulations proposed in the initial bill drew 
stiff opposition from republicans as revised the legislation 
establishes health and safety categories for which states must adopt 
standards 
seventy percent of the money would go to parents to help pay for 
child care 22 percent would go to training and grant and loan 
programs designed to improve the quality and supply of child care 
and 8 percent would go to states to administer programs and enforce 
standards 
the seperate bentsen tax credits package makes changes in the 
dependent care tax credit already provided to some families making 
it available even if they owe no federal taxes 
it also establishes a new tax credit of up to 500 to help pay 
for health insurance for children families with annual incomes of 
21000 or less would qualify for that credit 
over a fiveyear period the estimated cost of those credits is 
103 billion 
the third component stipulates that any financial assistance 
provided under the measure be used in a manner consistent with the 
constitution language designed to allow parents to use subsidies 
to pay for child care at churchrun centers provided government 
funds are not used for religious purposes 
dole said dodds financing approach left too much of the money in 
government hands and that the gop tax credit package which is 
similar to bentsens proposals would put the money directly in the 
hands of parents 
theyre the ones who are going to make the decisions not some 
institution not some bureaucrats dole said 
but democrats said there was no guarantee parents would use tax 
credits to pay for child care and that tax credits alone would do 
nothing to improve the quality and availability of care

rep tony coelho of california said goodbye to 
congress thursday with a speech on the house floor and a celebration 
belying the fact that an ethics inquiry had shot down his soaring 
career 
the generosity of my constituents and the goodwill of my 
colleagues have enabled me to serve for 25 years he said 
recounting his tenure first as a staffer and for the last decade 
as one of the most promising democratic members of the house 
over that time we made a difference and we made some changes 
but now the winds of change blow anew he said in a brief speech 
that evoked applause in the chamber and tears from some california 
colleagues 
political friends sponsored a capitol hill bash to mark the 
occasion and coehlos choice of a departure date his 47th birthday 
coehlo was perhaps the most adroit political operator among the 
house democrats in the early 1980s he transformed the democratic 
congressional campaign committee into a modern and powerful 
organization 
promoted in 1986 to the no 3 party post of majority whip he 
helped speaker jim wright maneuver legislation with such success in 
the 100th congress that republicans howled 
you know i play hard and i work hard he said in an 
interview earlier this week and im in the big leagues and i 
knew all along the way that when youre doing that if you make an 
error its not going to be like somebody on the back bench who made 
an error 
coelho failed to report a 50000 loan from a savings and loan 
whose chief executive had set him up in a junk bond deal financed by 
the loan coelho maintains that the deal was proper and that his 
only mistake had been an accounting oversight 
but the deal was exposed as wrights position was collapsing 
when coelho could have moved up from his post as whip to the 
position of majority leader 
the winds of change that blew coelho were whipped up by the 
wright affair and coelho couldnt face the prospect of battling 
against them so instead of stepping up the ladder he went for 
cover he quit 
i knew for the next two years the republicans would try to 
embarrass my party using the mistake that had been made he said 
the issues he had worked on including his efforts on behalf of 
fellow epileptics were too important he said 
so my ultimate political trick was to take away from them the 
very thing they wanted most to use me he said 
ironically the final votes of coelhos house career came as the 
chamber considered president bushs proposed bailout of the savings 
and loan industry much of the focus of the bill was to rein in 
thrift institutions whose sometimes risky investment strategies 
bankrupted the federal insurance program 
coelho says hes not bitter not angry about whats happened to 
him he compares it to a point earlier in his life when his quest 
for the priesthood was crushed because of his epilepsy 
at the time in 1964 the roman catholic church would not ordain 
epileptics it no longer has such blanket prohibitions in canon law 
against sufferers of specific diseases 
i was right on the verge of becoming a priest when that was 
taken away from me thats when i found out about my epilepsy 
all of a sudden at the last moment it was taken away 
but the good lord took me from that narrow pursuit to a 
different type of ministry 
he preached the democratic view but also boasted of having 
republican friends in recent years he consulted with former 
president nixon on foreign policy and other issues but not he 
says on the decision to resign 
coelho says he hasnt yet chosen a new career and will spend the 
next three months making some speeches for money and mulling his 
future 
that future may be in business or at a university he said but 
in all likelihood will never mean another run for elective office 
coelho said his resignation will permit him to continue his work 
on behalf of fellow epileptics 
he already has raised money to open 14 job centers for epileptics 
with hopes for 25 by the end of the year is sponsoring programs to 
educate children about epilepsy and is raising money for a center 
at ucla to study the treatment of afflicted children 
a lot of people dwell on the one side of me but dont pay 
attention to the other side he said by his resigning they 
found out about the other side he said

the supreme court on thursday upheld a key 
civil rights law as a weapon against private discrmination but 
barred its use to fight racial harassment such as assignment to 
menial tasks on the job 
civil rights groups finding little solace that a larger defeat 
was avoided expressed outrage and called the ruling the fourth 
major setback the court has dealt minorities and women this year 
a newly solidifed conservative majority led by appointees of 
former president reagan is undoing civil rights progress that began 
in the mid1950s the groups said 
this supreme court term has been a disaster for all those 
committed to equal employment opportunity said bejamin hooks and 
ralph neas of the leadership conference of civil rights 
in several rulings a slim majority of the court has turned 
back the clock on advances which so many worked long and hard to 
achieve said marcia greenberger of the national womens law 
center 
the court unanimously voted to reaffim its 1976 ruling that an 
1866 law enacted to help freed slaves could be used to sue private 
citizens accused of illegal racial bias 
by a separate 54 vote the justices ruled that the 123yearold 
law cannot be invoked to fight racial harassment 
there was considerable irony in the twopart ruling 
the justices sparked an uproar in the civil rights community last 
year by announcing they would use the relatively obscure case of a 
black north carolina bank teller to consider throwing out the 1976 
ruling 
some of the outrage was muted thursday when the court retreated 
from that threat but civil rights activists angrily noted that 
thursdays decision came on the heels of three major defeats for 
minority and womens rights 
its a sad commentary on the state of the courts general 
outlook on civil rights that todays decision must be greeted with a 
measure of relief said john buchanan of the liberal people for 
the american way 
last january the court banned racial quotas in the awarding of 
public works project by state and local governments 
on june 5 the justices restricted the use of statistical 
evidence to prove an employer illegally relegates minorities or 
women to lowerpaying jobs 
and just last monday the court significantly expanded the power 
of white men to challenge courtapproved affirmative action plans 
even years after those plans took effect 
writing for the court thursday justice anthony m kennedy said 
that concern for precedent compelled a reaffirmation of the 1976 
ruling 
even if that ruling was based on a mistaken interpretation of 
law he said it is certain that it is not inconsistent with the 
prevailing sense of justice in this country to the contrary it 
is entirely consistent with our societys deep commitment to the 
eradication of discrimination based on a persons race or the color 
of his or her skin 
but kennedy said allowing suits for racial harassment was not 
envisioned by the 1866 law 
that spelled defeat for brenda patterson a north carolina woman 
who was a teller at a credit union she sued under the 1866 law 
seeking actual and punitive damages for alleged harassment 
her assignment to sweep floors she said constituted 
impermissible racial harassment 
her suit had been dismissed by lower courts 
kennedy said the 1866 law governs contractual rights such as 
hiring and promotion decisions and not other forms of conduct by 
an employer such as assignments to tasks like sweeping floors 
a victim of racial harassment still could sue under the 1964 
civil rights act or various state laws the 1964 act does not allow 
the recovery of punitive damages while the 1866 act does also the 
1866 act applies to all employers while the 1964 statute exempts 
employers of 15 or fewer people about 15 percent of the work force 
justice william j brennan in a dissenting opinion said what 
the court declines to snatch away with one hand it takes with the 
other 
he said the ruling severely weakens the 1866 law by ignoring 
powerful historic evidence about the reconstruction congress 
concerns about ending racial bias 
joining brennan were justices thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens 
joining kennedy in limiting the 1866 law were chief justice 
william h rehnquist and justices sandra day oconnor antonin 
scalia and byron r white 
kennedy oconnor and scalia are reagan appointees rehnquist was 
promoted to chief justice by the former president white had been 
appointed by former president john f kennedy 
the courts 1976 decision at issue in the case is called runyon 
vs mccrary it held that racially segregated private schools that 
refuse to admit blacks violate the 1866 law 
that ruling allowed civil rights groups to use the 1866 law as a 
weapon to attack private discrimination in all forms and allows 
those who sue to collect much larger damages than other civil rights 
laws 
the attorneys general of nearly every state a majority of us 
senators more than 100 house members and more than 100 civil rights 
and public interest groups had urged the court not to tamper with 
its 1976 ruling 
in a separate decision thursday the court said states and state 
officials may not be sued under a related 1871 law that protects 
civil liberties the 54 ruling in a case from michigan said states 
and their officials are not persons as envisioned by the 1871 
law 
in other rulings the court 
gave some legal help to any man who saying he is the biological 
father seeks visitation rights to the child of a woman married to 
someone else 
voting 54 in a california case the justices said states must 
give such men a fair opportunity to seek visitation rights 
ruled by a 54 vote in a pennsylvania case that states may be 
forced through private lawsuits to help pay for cleaning up 
hazardous waste sites targeted under the socalled federal superfund 
act 
shielded states from federal court lawsuits by parents seeking 
to enforce a federal law aimed at assuring adequate education for 
handicapped children the court 54 spared pennsylvania from 
paying a years private school tuition for a student with a learning 
disability

a neighbor who found a womans missing 
dog forced her to increase her reward fourfold and set up a 
nighttime drop at a gas station police said 
but dogged police work resulted in the capture of four people on 
extortion conspiracy charges and sheila hawkins got back her 
5yearold miniature yorkshire terrier bentley in good condition 
the neighbor 18yearold construction worker ronnie blackwell 
told police hed grown fond of the shaggy little dog he said he 
found by the public library nearly a half mile from ms hawkins 
home in this northwestern south carolina city of about 44000 people 
he said he had become really attached to the dog and felt if he 
kept upping the price the lady would just think the dog wasnt 
worth it city police detective audrey mcnair said wednesday 
bentley had been missing since june 8 ms hawkins a 30yearold 
hairstylist put out fliers offering a 50 reward for the dogs 
return 
on sunday she received a phone call from a man who said he had 
the dog and promised to bring him to her house for the reward 
authorities said 
bentley never arrived instead a woman called three times 
sunday told ms hawkins we have the dog and said 50 wouldnt 
be enough according to a police report the woman identified 
herself as a mother whose son had found the dog and was very 
attached to him 
during one call a man said bentleys captors wanted 200 the 
report said 
ms hawkins agreed to the price but the dog wasnt returned she 
said she offered the callers a puppy the next time she had bentley 
bred but they werent interested 
on tuesday one of the captors relatives saw a television news 
report on the missing dog and apparently persuaded the four theyd 
better return it authorities said they called ms hawkins to say 
theyd return him that night 
that evening she got a call instructing her to go to a gas

us officials said thursday they are intrigued 
by but unable to explain fully the surprise arrest in cuba on 
corruption charges of a decorated army general who had been a 
trusted servant of the revolution 
the officials said it was not clear whether the action taken 
against gen arnaldo ochoa 58 was part of an anticorruption 
crackdown or because cuban authorities questioned his reliability 
the officials insisting on anonymity said they were cautious 
about drawing conclusions because of the absence of hard information 
ochoa is a veteran of angola and ethiopia and also served as 
commander of cuban forces in nicaragua according to rafael 
fermoselle a cuban exile and an expert on the cuban military ochoa 
was awarded the title hero of the revolution in 1984 and was 
cited by the council of state for a variety of virtues including 
honesty and purity 
the ministry of the revolutionary armed forces said in a 
statement wednesday that ochoa is being investigated for grave 
acts of corruption and dishonest use of economic resources 
according to one account ochoa had engaged in illicit sales of 
cuban sugar to angola 
gen rafael del pino the highest ranking military officer ever 
to defect from cuba said he believes there was a relationship 
between the arrest of ochoa and the sacking of transportation 
minister diocles torralba the day before 
del pino said that defense minister raul castro brother of 
president fidel castro had said in a speech wednesday that many of 
ochoas subordinates were arrested as well 
del pino who defected two years ago said he believes that the 
arrests were based on a highlevel of discontent within ochoas 
command which could have led to an uprising against president 
fidel castro 
he also said torralba during his military career was one of the 
most beloved and intelligent officers and had become the best 
prepared and most intelligent personality in the cuban government 
the council of state resolution approved on jan 1 1984 said 
that ochoa carried out several internationalist missions with 
particular spirit of sacrifice and brilliant performance as 
commander of cuban troops in ethiopia he also was praised for 
his honesty unselfishness spirit of sacrifice purity desire to 
excel and heroism 
del pino seemed to agree with that assessment saying that ochoa 
was not a member of the corrupt elite in cuba 
in a telephone conversation from havana before this weeks 
arrests elizardo sanchez a human rights activist in havana said 
there has been a deterioration of the rights situation in cuba in 
recent weeks which reflects government uneasiness 
as an example sanchez cited the case of roberto bahamonde an 
outspoken dissident who was arrested and sentenced to a sixmonth 
jail term last april for trying to organize a demonstration for 
visiting soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
sanchez said that last friday cuban authorities added a year to 
bahamondes jail term for engaging in illegal economic activities 
bahamonde had been selfemployed as a free lance photographer before 
his arrest 
selfemployment generally is illegal in cuba but sanchez said the 
thousands of cubans flout that law in order to improve their living 
standards he said the crackdown on bahamonde could only be 
interpreted as additional retaliation for his dissident activities

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
on thursday declared his first state visit to west germany had 
yielded a convergence of souls that stirred hopes for a new age 
of trust and cooperation in europe 
but while his fourday summit was drenched in an atmosphere of 
goodwill gorbachev gave no ground on the emotional issue of a 
reunited germany the issue of biggest concern to west germans 
at a news conference capping his appearances in bonn gorbachev 
dismissed the berlin wall as no great problem compared with 
other eastwest differences and sidestepped questions about the 
chances for reunification 
those issues are of utmost importance to west germans and 
gorbachevs failure to tackle them could allow the aura of goodwill 
to slip 
gorbachev enjoys more popularity among west germans than any 
other foreign statesman according to opinion polls and most of 
that support is rooted in a hope that his reforms will some day lead 
to reunification with moscowaligned east germany 
when the kremlin leader was asked whether he thought europe would 
ever again recognize a single german state he gave a vague and 
traditional reply 
the situation in europe today was determined by historical 
realities gorbachev answered referring to world war ii 
he dismissed suggestions the berlin wall stands as a symbol of 
the cold war and a time of less promise in relations between east 
and west 
i dont think the berlin wall is the sole barrier between east 
and west gorbachev said at the news conference 
soviet dissident and nobel peace laureate andrei sakharov said in 
amsterdam he hoped the berlin wall would be torn down soon and asked 
the communist world to liberate itself from the lies of the 
past 
sakharov in the netherlands to pick up an honorary law degree 
commented on gorbachevs remarks that the wall was no great 
problem nothing is eternal in this world 
it is a very good statement he said i hope it will happen 
soon but it would of course have been best if it would never have 
been built in the first place 
the soviet news agency tass later reported gorbachevs return 
home 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher will give 
us secretary of state james a baker iii a report on the gorbachev 
visit in washington next week state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said 
east germany built the wall in 1961 to halt a tide of emigration 
and gorbachev echoed the berlin government claim that it took 
advantage of its sovereign rights to build the wall and that its 
removal depended on an end to the conditions that led to its 
construction 
gorbachev suggested the wall should not be given too much 
significance in eastwest relations noting it was one of a number 
of differences 
i see this as no great problem he concluded 
reflecting west germans eagerness to see the soviet visit in the 
most positive light bonn government spokesman hans klein said he 
saw gorbachevs response as containing rays of hope 
the soviet general secretary said this is something that can be 
overcome something that can be solved klein said later 
gorbachev told steelworkers in the industrial city of dortmund in 
the ruhr valley that what weve encountered here on your soil 
moved us a lot 
we saw many faces we looked many people in the eyes we felt 
much sympathy i would say a convergence of souls he said 
both soviet and west german officials appeared to take special 
care throughout the summit to avoid controversy 
a joint declaration of goals for europe which gorbachev 
described as the most momentous accomplishment of his summit 
reiterated arms control objectives on which both the warsaw pact and 
nato have similar approaches yet it omitted any mention of 
shortrange nuclear weapons over which the two blocs disagree 
despite the lack of movement on issues close to west germans the 
image of successful eastwest diplomacy could offer political 
rewards for both leaders 
chancellor helmut kohls christian democratic party has lost 
badly in recent elections and gorbachev continues to face 
widespread resistance to his reforms 
both soviets and west germans suffer some insecurity about their 
standing in world affairs and the outpouring of good feeling the 
past four days has boosted their sense of confidence 
west german president richard von weizsaecker said gorbachevs 
visit had formed a bond between the peoples of the soviet union and 
west germany 
if you think of all the suffering and also the fear its a 
real human and political advance weizsaecker said the 
attraction and also trust have grown 
at his news conference gorbachev also said his leadership 
regretted some aspects of the conflict in china and expressed 
concern over the future of reforms there it was his most extensive 
comment on china since prodemocracy demonstrations heated up during 
his visit to beijing a month ago

representing jan parsons and her father john that one of lowes 
atlantaarea lawyers was aware of the witness statements

that ms wilson and her former husband attempted to blackmail the 
actor before suing

to propose a settlement offer and that he replied that he would 
discuss settlement options and that his client would consider any 
offer lowes lawyers cared to make 
henry denied making a settlement demand of 500000 he said his 
client rejected a take it or leave it settlement offer of 
35000 in february he did say he told kinsella he would recommend 
acceptance of a 500000 offer if kinsella were to make such an 
offer but that he did so at the urging of kinsella

acting career could be damaged by criminal or civil actions and

federal police who guard the us capitol and 
the white house are needed in the most drugplagued neighborhoods in 
the nations capital to help local officers fight the district of 
columbias crime wave city police officials said thursday 
district police chief isaac fulwood departing from previous 
statements by city officials that they want federal officers for 
help only with administrative tasks said they could be better used 
on the streets 
it was never my intention to have the capitol police serve in 
administrative functions to not use them in a frontline mode 
fulwood told the house administration personnel and police 
subcommittee were talking about areas where bad things are 
happening i cant soften the blow 
fulwood asked the panel for 500 federal officers from the us 
capitol police us park police and the uniformed division of the 
secret service which guards the white house the capitol force the 
largest of the three with 1250 officers would make the largest 
contribution 
the request comes during a drugrelated crime surge that has 
given washington the highest murder rate in the nation through 
thursday 202 persons had been killed here in 1989 compared with 
133 at this time last year there were a record 372 homicides in the 
district in 1988 
mayor marion barry said earlier this month that if federal 
officers were put on detail to the city police department they 
would likely handle desk duties while city officers bolster street 
patrols 
several committee members were taken aback by the idea that 
officers who now patrol capitol hill hallways filled with 
congressional aides and tourists should be put into action against 
guntoting criminals 
that sounds to me like its damn serious and lifethreatening 
said rep pat roberts rkan im not sure every capitol police 
officer is a warrior 
fulwood said the officers would be used only until the city can 
recruit and train additional officers 
the house earlier this week passed a measure that would authorize 
127 million in federal spending over five years to help the city 
hire 700 additional police officers the city police force now 
numbers slightly more than 3900 officers

researchers studying hemophiliacs say they 
have developed a method to predict more accurately whether a person 
infected with the aids virus will develop the deadly disease within 
two years 
scientists from penn state university school of medicine and the 
national cancer institute report that hemophiliacs with particular 
levels of two aids indicators are three times more likely than those 
with only one to develop aids within two years according to a 
report in this weeks issue of the philadelphiabased annals of 
internal medicine 
the results are similar to findings among gay men said an aids 
researcher currently researchers believe that those infected with 
the aids virus or hiv will go on to develop the disease but some 
people remain healthy for years 
all the hiv antibody test tells us is whos infected said 
dr m elaine eyster of penn state but it doesnt tell us who 
will come down with aids 
other aids researchers said the results were not unexpected as 
earlier studies showed that additional indicators in other 
populations also increase the likelihood of developing aids 
the twoyear study examined blood samples from as long ago as 
1979 taken from 87 hemophiliacs infected with hiv or human 
immunodeficiency virus 
the researchers compared how well they could predict whether a 
patient would go on to develop aids based on blood levels of an hiv 
protein p24 and t4 helper cells which help fight infection 
according to eyster the p24 protein is present in about 50 
percent of those with aids and about 25 percent of those infected 
with the aids virus only 
of the eight hemophiliacs with low counts of t4 cells and levels 
of p24 five developed aids within two years according to eyster 
only eight of the 36 patients without p24 and a low t4 cell count 
developed aids within the same time 
eyster said that although the numbers are small the ratio 
demonstrates the higher risk 
developing what eyster called the hazard ratio will enable 
phsyicians to identify individuals at higher risk for the rapid 
progression of aids and provide counseling and treatment earlier in 
the progression of the disease 
eyster said the results could be generalized to other populations 
at risk for aids 
a researcher at the university of california at san francisco 
dr andrew moss said san francisco researchers have found similar 
results in studies of gay men 
dr jeffrey laurence of cornell medical school said the results 
added weight to similar studies but were totally expected 
he said however that knowledge gained through the studies will 
aid researchers testing aids drugs in clinical trials as they select 
patients who could best benefit from the treatments 
dr susan zollapazner an immunologist with new york university 
medical school whose lab discovered one of the aids indicators said 
p24 is limited as a predictor because it is present only in about 
onefourth of those infected with the aids virus 
according to dr james goedert of the national cancer institute 
one of the studys authors the research differed from previous work 
because it offered a qualitative risk 
its an important step he said prior to this its not 
been real clear what the expected rate of infection would be in that 
population 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is transmitted 
through tainted blood sexual contact and dirty hypodermic needles 
the primary victims in the united states are hemophiliacs drug 
abusers and homosexuals

canada will ban ivory imports from africa to help 
protect elephants which are being slaughtered for their tusks at a 
rate of 70000 a year the federal government said thursday 
this action should serve to indicate canadas desire to 
discourage any further speculative slaughter of these magnificent 
animals external affairs minister joe clark said in a statement 
he said canada also is supporting efforts to ban commercial 
trading in african elephant ivory under the convention on 
international trade in endangered species 
we are delighted that they have acted said ron orenstein a 
spokesman for the african elephant emergency network 
the canadian group whose sponsors include the world wildlife 
fund and toronto zoo has been lobbying for bans to choke the ivory 
market 
orenstein said poachers have killed more than 125 million 
african elephants in the past decade reducing the continents 
elephant population to 750000 
about 80 percent of the elephant ivory imported to the west 
comes from poachers he said at this rate the elephants will be 
extinct in 10 to 12 years 
poaching has increased he said because prices for ivory have 
gone up from 270 a pound in the 1960s to 136 a pound 
he said the united states france west germany britain and 
other countries already have taken similar action 
officials could not immediately estimate the value of ivory sales 
in canada

a federal judge on thursday prohibited 
random drug testing of the us government investigators who conduct 
background checks and oversee drug testing of other federal 
employees and job applicants 
in a nationwide ruling us district judge d lowell jensen also 
barred mandatory postaccident drug testing of all 5500 employees 
of the office of personnel management or opm but allowed testing 
of individual employees based on a supervisors reasonable 
suspicion of illegal drug use 
jensen said us supreme court rulings in march allowing drug 
testing of certain customs service employees and postaccident 
testing of railroad workers did not necessarily authorize testing 
of government employees in lesssensitive or lessrisky jobs 
the decision takes some of the sting out of the prior 
rulings said lawrence pulgram a lawyer for workers affected by 
the tests he called it a good first step toward limiting the 
governments campaign to implement these drug testing programs 
throughout the government 
the ruling was issued after government lawyers had left for the 
day it could be appealed to the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
the opm is the successor to the us civil service commission 
besides supervising the federal civil service system it directs 
other federal agencies giving drug tests to workers under an 
executive order by former president ronald reagan 
jensens decision halts drug testing that began last september in 
the opms washington dc office testing inother offices has been 
suspended while the lawsuit is pending 
the random drug testing order applied to about 650 investigators 
who conduct background checks on applicants for sensitive civil 
service jobs and for private jobs with military contractors 
they were to be required to submit to urine testing at any time 
with two hours notice the employees lawsuit said testing without 
grounds to suspect individual drug use violated the constitutional 
ban on unreasonable searches 
opm investigators have lesssensitive jobs which do not 
ordinarily subject them to possible bribery or physical threats and 
can be subjected to an unlimited number of drug tests under the 
random testing program jensen said 
he also prohibited postaccident testing which covered any of 
opms 5500 employees involved in an accident that caused injury 
requiring hospitalization or more than 1000 in property damage 
jensen said the supreme court ruling in the railroad case which 
allowed postaccident testing without individual suspicion of drug 
use was based on justifications that did not exist in the opm case

the decision complicates an issue that sparked three rebellions 
against president raul alfonsin and threatens to undermine the 
government of presidentelect carlos menem who is to take office in 
three weeks 
alfonsin will hand power to menem on july 8 the two men 
announced thursday making a decision reportedly delayed by the 
problem posed by some 20 generals facing charges connected to the 
militarys dirty war against leftists 
also unresolved are the cases of several hundred officers and 
soldiers who took part in april 1987 and january 1988 uprisings and 
a december 1988 barracks revolt 
menem clearly wants alfonsin to resolve the matter and take the 
political heat a decision will generate 
alfonsins term was to expire dec 10 but he said monday he wants 
to leave office early because his outgoing government cannot resolve 
argentinas economic crisis 
attorney general andres dalessio had asked the supreme court to 
determine whether the four generals could be sheltered from 
prosecution by partial amnesty laws 
court spokesman antonio lopez de tejada said the court ruled 
thursday that galtieri and gens santiago riveros luciano jauregui 
and ramon bessone must stand trial 
about 20 generals face charges of kidnapping torture and murder 
in some of the arrests and disappearances of nearly 9000 
argentinians between the march 1976 military coup and alfonsins 
election in october 1983 
the high command wants the courts to stop the trials and free 
officers convicted in december 1985 
the issue is sensitive politicians and military officials talk 
vaguely of national reconciliation healing wounds and 
vindicating the armys role in what was a war 
human rights groups charge the military committed genocide and 
demand the generals be tried 
gen galtieri who ruled from december 1981 to june 1982 is in 
jail for mishandling the 1982 falklands island war against britain 
he is accused of ordering the death of 13 opponents who defense 
attorneys say were shot as they tried to escape

us ambassador robert h pelletreau jr 
the only authorized channel for american contacts with the plo met 
with the plo envoy to tunisia hakam balawi the official 
palestinian news agency said thursday 
it said the two discussed the latest developments in the 
palestinian cause and efforts to push ahead on the road to peace 
in the middle east at a meeting wednesday at the us embassy 
the united states began a dialogue with the palestine liberation 
organization in december after the plo took steps to recognize 
israel renounce terrorism and opted for a twostate solution to the 
conflict with the israelis 
israel refuses to talk with the plo calling it a terrorist 
organization 
a us delegation headed by pelletreau has held three formal 
meetings with a palestinian delegation in the tunisian capital in 
december in march and again june 8 
pelletreau and balawi have met on other occasions however 
western diplomats said meanwhile in paris on thursday that 
unescos executive board has decided to put off for the time being a 
debate on whether to admit palestine as a member 
they said that under a compromise agreement reached after three 
weeks of negotiations the issue will go on the agenda of the 
general conference unescos highest decisionmaking body which 
meets this fall but they added it may not come up for a vote 
the diplomats spoke on the condition of anonymity 
a twothirds majority of the 158 member nations of the un 
educational scientific and cultural organization would be needed to 
admit palestine as a member 
another un body the world health organization decided on may 
12 to put off the issue until next year 
the united states says if palestine is admitted as a unesco 
member this would effectively finish any chance it might return to 
the organization 
the united states withdrew from unesco at the end of 1984 
holding it had become overly political and was mismanaged britain 
followed suit a year later

mexicos former federal security chief pleaded 
innocent thursday to charges he ordered the murder of a prominent 
journalist and denied links to a mexican drug kingpin blaming it 
all on pure gossip 
jose antonio zorrilla perez 47 was charged with firstdegree 
murder in the parking garage shooting of newspaper columnist manuel 
buendia who exposed drug trafficking gunrunning and wrongdoing in 
high places 
buendia of the daily excelsior was killed in mexico city on may 
30 1984 
i am innocent of all these charges zorrilla a former 
director of the mexican equivalent of the fbi said at his 
arraignment in criminal court 
there is no evidence for the city attorney general to send 
this case to trial because of pure gossip and elaborate work a 
tale was created to have me declared responsible for these crimes 
shortly after the hearing prosecutors announced the filing of 
additional charges of obstruction of justice abuse of authority and 
cover up in investigating the buendia case 
zorrilla faces up to 40 years in prison on the murder charge and 
22 additional years on the other charges 
in testimony and depositions witnesses and some associates swore 
zorrilla was linked to drug kingpin rafael caro quintero and ordered 
buendia killed because he feared the columnist would expose him 
caro quintero is awaiting trial in the 1985 torturemurder of a 
us drug agent enrique camarena salazar

the federal government is spending more to control 
aids than to conquer heart disease which kills 20 times more 
americans but some critics contend it is still not enough 
a report today described as the first to sum up the entire 
federal aids effort found the government this year is spending 22 
billion on the epidemic with more than half going to research and 
prevention the figure will grow to 43 billion in 1992 
we were surprised to learn the extent to which so many 
different individuals and agencies were involved in aids efforts 
said dr william winkenwerder who directed the analysis the 
breadth of the effort of the federal government was greater than we 
thought it might be 
in an editorial published with the study in the new england 
journal of medicine dr david e rogers of cornell medical college 
in new york said he believes the nation is still spending vastly 
too little on aids

lisa hart a single parent getting by as a fastfood worker at an 
oklahoma city hardees said she was looking forward to a good pay 
raise until president bush vetoed the minimum wage bill 
lee soule who owns a small restaurant in san francisco said he 
too believes the minimum wage should be increased and is sorry the 
president vetoed the bill 
ms hart and soule were among workers and managers queried by the 
associated press on wednesday following bushs veto of a measure to 
gradually raise the current 335 hourly minimum to 455 democrats 
in congress tried to override the veto but fell short of the 
twothirds majority needed to do so 
out in the saloons and restaurants and pet shops where the issue 
has the most impact opinion was mixed but most people on both the 
management and labor side agreed the current minimum is not enough 
people have to understand how treacherous it is to try and live 
on 335 an hour said soule who pays waiters at his midscale 
pacific cafe the california hourly minimum of 425

the capitol is a place of high 
curiosity and low anxiety nearly a year after a group of alabamans 
who doled out 100000 for legislative favors turned out to be fbi 
agents hunting corruption 
since 30 federal agents raided the offices of four legislators 
and their aides the night of aug 24 1988 one lawmaker has been 
indicted for bribery extortion and money laundering and several 
others are under investigation 
weve lived with this for a year now so that the initial shock 
has worn off said bob forsyth a top senate aide the curiosity 
now is about whos next and if theyll be somebody next there must 
be a few people here privately who are worried but generally there 
is high curiosity and low anxiety 
the raid revealed a complex 3year sting in which the fbi set up 
phony companies to dispense cash for specialinterest legislation 
agents videotaped lawmakers taking cash according to the lawyer for 
a key fbi informant 
the fbi descended on the capitol after a legislative aide 
reportedly refused to work as an informant and agents feared she 
would tip other people as the agents moved through the building 
several staffers reportedly shredded documents and erased sensitive 
files from computers 
sen joseph montoya one of the four lawmakers whose offices were 
searched pleaded innocent june 12 to 10 counts of violating the 
hobbs act which is used in bribery cases involving public 
officials and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations 
act the el monte democrat who has served 17 years in the 
legislature faces 25 million in fines and 200 years in prison if 
convicted an aide amiel jaramillo pleaded innocent to three 
counts 
the other three whose offices were searched all members of the 
assembly are gwen moore dlos angeles and republicans pat nolan 
of glendale and frank hill of whittier nolan served as republican 
leader of the democratdominated assembly until he stepped down 
partly because of the fbi investigation 
the san francisco examiner reported tuesday that irs agents 
assisting the fbi had subpoenaed the files on 16 bills carried by 
sen alan robbins chairman of the senate insurance committee 
robbins declined to comment 
except for montoya no lawmaker has been indicted or arrested 
all have denied any wrongdoing 
the undercover agents gave more than 90000 in campaign 
contributions honoraria and other payments to state and local 
officials aides campaign consultants and others according to 
government and private financial records obtained by the associated 
press a federal source knowledgeable with the investigation said 
about 100000 maybe a little more was budgeted 
about a fifth of the money went to paul carpenter a former state 
senator and now a member of the powerfulbutobscure board of 
equalization which sets property tax assessments for utilities and 
is californias tax appeals agency 
carpenter received three payments in 1986 totaling 20000 
carpenter said he was interviewed by the fbi but has declined to 
discuss the case further 
moore hill and nolan got several thousand dollars each and 
other minor contributions were scattered throughout the legislature 
the sting has been dubbed capscam or shrimpscam by the 
media but its official fbi file name is brispec for bribery 
special interest according to documents sources and published 
reports here is how it worked 
fbi agents posed as representatives of a mobile alabased 
company planning to launch a shrimpprocessing plant in west 
sacramento they went to lawmakers seeking legislation that would 
lure investment to the phony company as they spread donations around 
the capitol 
ultimately two bills pushed by the undercover agents were 
approved by the legislature both written by moore were vetoed 
by gov george deukmejian who had been tipped off by the fbi 
one agent who identified himself as jack gordon of alabama 
was an engaging countrybumpkin type who became a familiar figure 
in the capitol he was often accompanied on his capitol rounds by 
john shahabian a senate staffer who was serving the fbi as an 
undercover informant 
shahabians lawyer sacramento attorney donald heller said his 
client was involved in audio and video recordings of lawmakers 
taking money 
the fbi probe was secret until aug 24 as about 30 agents 
gathered in the hyatt regency hotel across the street from the 
capitol others were inside the statehouse interviewing karen 
watson an aide to nolan during the interview the agents 
reportedly asked watson to work as an informant she refused 
within minutes agents left the hotel and headed for the capitol

newton van drunen made millions of 
dollars in just three years but the government didnt like his 
methods 
when us secret service agents and mexican police raided his 
suburban juarez house in february van drunen was running off 50 
bills the authorities seized 126 million in phony tens twenties 
and fifties 
van drunen 61 contends he was just eight months and 1 million 
away from buying a papermanufacturing plant and printing perfect 
counterfeit us currency the secret service says he already was 
pretty close 
printing american currency is a very difficult task he said 
in an interview at cereso prison the secret service and mexican 
banking experts both tell me that other people have done better than 
i have i would like to meet those people i would like to shake 
their hand 
by the time of the raid van drunen had circulated some 7 
million in bogus bills making him one of the most prolific 
counterfeiters in history 
the owlish balding van drunen speaks slowly in a low raspy 
voice and stoops his 6foot5 frame to make himself heard over the 
din in the prisons crowded grimy visiting room though 
considerably older taller and grayer than most of the inmates he 
seems to mix well he uses mexican hand gestures and like most 
mexicans stands closer than most americans are used to 
the search for van drunen began about three years ago after 
counterfeit money turned up in the denver area bill driscoll the 
secret service agent in charge in el paso texas wouldnt give 
details relations between us and mexican police are touchy but 
the bills were traced to juarez and to van drunens house police 
waited to hear the press before bursting in 
van drunen said he intended to use the counterfeit millions to 
build a saltwater desalinization plant on the gulf coast in 
tamaulipas state it would have let him make legal profits to help 
his adopted homeland 
van drunen was born in ontario canada to american parents and 
grew up in illinois he worked in his teens and 20s with mexican 
farmworkers in illinois and learned spanish he says he feels most 
comfortable around mexicans his wife alicia zamorra is a native 
of mexico 
in 1975 he was convicted of smuggling mexicans into the united 
states he spent 18 months in federal prison in sandstone minn 
where they just needed people in the print shop and they shoved me 
in there isnt that ironic 
van drunen used the knowledge he gained in prison when he got 
out fabricating green cards permanent us residency cards 
for aliens and social security cards most of his customers were 
mexicans 
he was caught convicted of counterfeiting government documents 
and spent almost three years in federal prison in springfield mo 
he was released on parole in 1984 and moved to chicago 
there van drunen accumulated 10 tons of printing and embossing 
equipment he and alicia bought a used school bus for 400 
decorated it with curtains and plastic flowers in the windows and 
loaded the equipment inside 
on the 19th day of january 1986 we invoked the lords 
blessing on our enterprise and began our pilgrimage said van 
drunen who tends to temper his formal stilted language with a 
droll tone of voice 
a week later they were househunting in juarez it was not a 
spurofthemoment thing im somewhat deliberate in everything i 
do 
he chose to live in mexico because officials would ask fewer 
questions he picked juarez to be close to us ink paper and 
equipment supplies and because there are so many usowned 
factories that an american passes on the street and no one turns 
his head 
they bought the house in alicias name and persuaded the city to 
install heavyduty power lines as expected no one asked questions 
van drunen figured it would take five batches to perfect his 
counterfeits the first couple of lots were of low quality and he 
sold them at five cents on the dollar most of it about 7 million 
was circulated around monterrey 
i am afraid that some of it circulated in the united states 
he said mournfully there was an agreement that none of it would 
be circulated in the united states but im afraid they broke their 
end of the agreement 
there is not much honor among thieves son 
still van drunen refuses to talk about the partners and 
customers who indirectly contributed to the arrest that ended a 
nearly idyllic lifestyle the couple visited 24 of mexicos 31 
states in a 1974 chevy pickup truck modified with a heavyduty 
radiator and a seat built to relieve his sciatica 
we went to see things that the tourist never sees we even 
found a race of mulefooted hogs 7000 feet up in the mountains of 
guerrero we had a good time every time wed find a flower we were 
unfamiliar with wed bring it back and see what we could do with 
it im crazy about flowers 
during fall and winter when humidity is low and printing 
conditions best because paper doesnt swell with moisture van 
drunen would make money 
the job entailed sending paper through a heidelberg sheet feed 
press 10 times then through an embossing machine to give the paper 
its texture us currency has tiny blue and red threads woven into 
it that make it difficult to counterfeit van drunen was printing 
tiny lines on his currency to mimic the threads but he had a 
grander plan to buy a paper factory and make currency paper 
indistinguishable from the real thing 
he could have bought the plant with 1 million and could have had 
the paper in october he said the next step was perfection 
but van drunen likely wont get to achieve perfection he expects 
to spend years in cereso meanwhile he and some largescale drug 
dealers intend to bring some type of industry to the prison to give 
inmates something to do 
who knows he said a devilish grin flitting across his face 
maybe well set up a print shop here

his mother is an ape the local priest has informed him that he is 
an insult to god and to top it all off the woman he loves 
turns out to be his sister 
who wouldnt run amok in the forest and run smack into a tree 
despite coming from the same team who produced the delightful 
life and loves of a shedevil the threehour miniseries first 
born is a silly melodrama airing in three parts an hour a week 
beginning saturday on the arts amp entertainment cable network 
first born at least proves that the esteemed bbc is capable 
of producing remarkably tedious drivel even the fine charles dance 
is adrift in this selfimportant tale of a scientist who creates a 
halfman halfgorilla the film was based on the maureen duffy 
novel gor saga 
dance plays dr edward forrester a geneticist struggling to 
create the new species coveted by the military for its potential as 
a fighting force 
the film opens with the birth of his seventh attempt at creating 
the hybrid through in vitro fertilization thank goodness no 
attempt at major special effects here the bouncing baby whatever is 
a human infant with hair stuck all over him the mother a lowland 
gorilla named mary rejects the baby and he is raised by a human 
foster mother 
forrester at first covers up the topsecret experiment by 
explaining that he is seeking to cross a gorilla and an orangutan 
though no one at the laboratory seems at all fazed by the babys 
obviously human face 
forrester tells the military that the experiment has been 
terminated then concocts a story about the childs parents being 
killed in a car wreck and sends gor short for gordon packing 
off to military school 
the grown gor played by the wideeyed jamie foster has turned 
out to be quite a perfect gentleman at military school he proves 
to be a fine athlete but cant bring himself to harm another 
creature he decides to join the priesthood this doesnt bother 
forrester but gors budding infatuation with forresters daughter 
does 
everyone involved seems to take the production terribly 
seriously even dressing it up with a lot of religious overtones 
mary indeed for fans of inadvertent comedy however the laughable 
conclusion recalls the daffy kitsch of the omen movie series and 
might be worth the wait

archaeologists have been excavating this 
ancient oasis for more than 50 years but it will take 30 more 
before the full splendor of palmyras temples tombs and colonnades 
is restored 
lines of weathered columns gleam golden against green datepalms 
hundreds more lie buried in the sand along with piles of huge stone 
blocks dating back 1800 years to a time when palmyra was the center 
of a kingdom on desert caravan routes 
if we brought in bulldozers we could clear the site in six 
months but wed also destroy much evidence needed to assess the 
citys role in history said archaeologist khaled assad the site 
director 
doing it slowly means another generation of work by syrian and 
foreign excavators but well also be restoring as much of the 
ancient city as possible 
polish french west german east german and japanese 
archaeologists are digging in different areas of palmyra 
syria where human habitation has been traced back 150000 years 
is an archaeological treasure house of the remnants of countless 
civilizations that have flourished and fallen throughout its history 
about half of ancient palmyra about 4 square miles has been 
unearthed 
its syrias top tourist attraction drawing more than 70000 
visitors a year 
palmyra was important because it was the hub of the network of 
caravan trails that carried silks and spices from eastern asia 
across the roman province of arabia to the mediterranean 
but its rebellious queen zenobia challenged romes authority the 
city was plundered in 272 ad after she was captured during a long 
siege 
palmyra is a unique site its a great responsibility and 
we have to look after it restoring the architecture bringing it 
back to life said culture minister najar attar 
this year conservators finished renovating a 3000seat 
amphitheater overlooking a colonnaded main avenue where plays 
concerts and youth festivals will be staged 
a tall arched portico forms the backdrop flanked by deepset 
doorways and pillars made of limestone hauled from local quarries 
palymra boasts very lively roman architecture and its public 
buildings are superbly planned said asif bahnassi a recently 
retired director of antiquities who supervised the restoration 
weve reerected more than 150 columns as well as many masonry 
blocks you can feel the sense of spaciousness and grandeur 
when excavations started in the 1930s the villagers of palmyra 
lived in the ruins of the huge temple of bel the babylonian 
equivalent of zeus king of the gods in greek mythology 
they were resettled in a town that now has a population of 30000 
the only modern building among the ruins is the 12room hotel 
zenobia dating from 1918 mentioned in many middle east travelers 
memoirs 
but its unlikely to be torn down because it happens to stand 
in the courtyard of a temple to the rain god belshamin and doesnt 
overlie anything important assad said 
last year he said syrian archaeologists pulled 30 pieces of 
really beautiful statuary from an underground tomb dated around 98 
ad 
in that period wealthy palmyrenes buried their relatives in 
family tombs decorated with portraits of the deceased in sculpture 
and wall painting 
the excavators are still looking for a likeness of queen zenobia 
she doesnt appear in the archaeological record although we 
have a good deal of information about her her career was 
recorded in detail by roman historians assad said 
the site of her palace has been identified but a later roman 
emperor diocletian razed its remains and built a military camp 
there some 30 years after the city was captured 
in the 3rd century palmyra won tax breaks from the romans that 
helped boost its commercial importance 
in addition to its markets for luxury goods the city operated a 
network of caravan hostelries at 15mile intervals equivalent to a 
days journey palmyrene merchants owned ships that sailed in the 
persian gulf 
but zenobia provoked imperial anger by asserting the citys 
independence after her arab husband odeinat died 
she was very ambitious for her son wahballat but she was also 
a strong personality in her own right assad said 
called the most beautiful woman in the orient she wore roman 
purple and addressed her troops on horseback like an emperor on 
campaign she followed political developments in rome and hired a 
greek philosopher longinus as an adviser 
zenobia was seized by the romans near the euphrates river while 
riding a camel to seek help against the emperor aurelians siege of 
palmyra 
according to some historians she was taken to rome where she 
married a roman senator and lived in a villa at tivoli

built more than a quarter century ago a 
usstyle housing project in a bogotas biggest suburb endures like 
a living if somewhat seedy monument to a lost panamerican dream 
when built the project called superblock seven was proclaimed by 
politicians and planners from a host of countries as a bold first 
step toward a grand goal the eradication of homelessness and 
extreme poverty in the region 
it grew out of president john f kennedys alliance for progress 
a program intended to counter the spread of fidel castros 
revolution throughout latin america 
now the lives of its 8000 middleincome and workingclass 
occupants reflect a more complex reality in which social chasms 
persist they grapple with graffiti and trash drug use and crime 
and they sometimes wistfully recall the communitys hopeful origins 
this was an extraordinary thing nowadays you dont find such 
ambitious projects said francisco lozano a civil servant in his 
40s who has lived in superblock seven for 17 years the state 
doesnt get that involved anymore now its all free enterprise and 
the private sector 
superblock seven was planned as a suburb of statesubsidized 
housing south of bogota for the masses of impoverished colombians 
crowding into the city 
a pilot project for all of latin america the suburb was named 
kennedy city 
when ground was broken for superblock seven in 1961 the area was 
little more than open farmland the project with its 1248 
apartments in 42 buildings and 214 onestory rowhouses was to be 
the hub of kennedy city and a magnet for more such construction 
a magnet it was but development exceeded planners expectations 
in both pace and scale 
shacks began to sprout as people many of them peasants from the 
countryside streamed in faster than proper homes could be built in 
all about forty superblocks were built some of them much bigger 
but they hold only a fraction of the suburbs population estimated 
to exceed 1 million and still growing 
the poverty that planners dreamed of erasing came to occupy the 
suburbs fringes just as it persisted in other marginal sections of 
bogota as in other colombian cities violence and political 
extremism grew rather than declined fueled by a new activity drug 
trafficking 
as kennedy city grew the alliance for progress lost momentum in 
latin america and a world recession in the 1970s put the squeeze on 
state support for ambitious public projects also a new approach to 
development began taking hold with the state role shrinking and 
more emphasis on private funding 
the area around superblock seven became a commercial center 
transforming the project into a kind of strange island designed by 
us architects its sturdy brick buildings broad grassy 
quadrangles basketball courts and asphalt parking lots seem more 
appropriate to an aging new jersey suburb latin america housing 
tends to be more tightly packed 
we knew we were a kind of guinea pig said carlos paz elias 
the 65yearold president of the projects association of 
homeowners he is one of the original residents who call themselves 
founders 
kennedy city was supposed to spread out from here he said 
we were supposed to be at the center of a star reaching out along 
eight avenues we were suppose to reach out not be enclosed like a 
prison 
but thats what we are like now a prison trying to keep the 
the city out 
three city blocks wide by five blocks long the superblock has 
been gradually closing off its entrances with chainlink fences and 
padlocks too many people are coming in to dump trash use drugs 
mug and rob 
the problem is mostly at night said horacio valencia marin 
50 a telephone company workers who has lived 22 years in the 
superblock if you come home late theyre sure to mug you 
lozanos teenage son francisco jr said at night here you 
see lots of drug addiction twenty or 25 boys get together and smoke 
marijuana you cant walk around alone theyll rob you 
the father blamed a general apathy among colombians and said they 
needed to become more socially aware and active but he also 
criticized what he saw as a more confrontational us attitude 
toward latin america 
they used to give us aid and now look at this problem of the 
foreign debt they are squeezing us he said 
now they sell us weapons president kennedy was special it was 
so much better to talk of the alliance for progress than this talk 
of an alliance for war

batman flies into 2100 us and canadian 
theaters june 23 amid a cloud of superhype and minicontroversy 
and a storm of merchandise ranging from earrings to underwear 
the warner bros version of the 50yearold comic book has proved 
the most talkedabout movie of the summer season though not all of 
the talk has been good the studio hopes that its publicity blast 
and the film itself will steamroller the negative stuff 
controversy began with the casting of michael keaton as bruce 
wayne aka batman longtime batfans were expecting more of a hunk 
to play their hero not a slim comedy actor 
i had heard something about the protests while i was making 
the picture in england but it didnt seem like any big deal to 
me says keaton i am shockedslashfascinated im telling you 
man these people must have the same lobbyists as the nra national 
rifle association these guys have some clout i cant believe it 
i mean how many are there 
its just funny to me i never had time to get angry about it 
because we were working in england and i missed a lot of it until i 
came back 
director tim burton adds comic book people are very specific 
they have a very strong image in their minds but its a real source 
of argument because every comic book fan has a different opinion 
when we went into batman we decided to try to be true to it but 
to do our own thing also 
though keaton achieved stardom in such comedies as mr mom 
and beetlejuice he displays little of his antic humor as bruce 
wayne and none as batman 
i always try to do what the role requires and i try to do a 
different role every time he said i discussed the role with 
tim as well as jack nicholson the character was clearly more 
powerful if he was more internal as jack said to me in makeup one 
day just let the wardrobe act kid there was great wisdom in 
that statement the real power came from within 
my natural tendency is to do more because you sometimes fear 
youre not doing enough the longer im an actor the more i 
discover that less is more 
early reviews of batman have not been the raves that warner 
bros would dearly love the associated press said it was 
ultimately unsatisfying the makers of the 1989 batman cant 
seem to make up their minds tim burton seems overburdened with 
the logistics of an immensely costly production 
rolling stone called it a classic but time magazine found the 
style daunting and lurching and observed that the film prowls 
slowly so slowly in search of grandeur but it often finds 
murk 
daily variety termed batman uneven and commented that jack 
nicholsons incandescent joker overwhelms michael keatons subdued 
title character 
films such as rambo first blood part ii and coming to 
america overcame poor reviews to amass 100 millionplus grosses 
if reviewers thumb down batman can it prove equally 
criticproof 
i hope so says director burton you hope people will judge 
the movie and not the merchandising 
i dont care what anybody says the movies good declares 
keaton its an awful lot of fun hows that strong enough 
batman has been a 10year crusade for producers jon peters 
and peter guber why so long 
because we were making 30 other pictures everything from the 
color purple to flashdance to caddyshack to the witches of 
eastwick peters said we paid tom mankiewicz 750000 and went 
through five or six drafts and still came up with something that was 
too derivative too much like superman 
batman began to take shape with the addition of writer sam 
hamm and tim burton a graduate of disney animation who had directed 
only two films peewees big adventure and beetlejuice 
peters recalled suggesting the role of the joker to nicholson 
while filming the witches of eastwick on location in new england 
we were talking at 3 am on the night before jack had to do 
the church sequence in which he denounced women and threw up over 
everybody i said he should play the joker and he said are you 
crazy here i am playing the devil and making every woman mad at me 
you want to throw my career down the toilet 
after weeks of persuasion nicholson began to see possibilities 
in the role peters first choice for batman was bill murray i 
wanted an action picture that was funny but after seeing 
beetlejuice the producers chose keaton sean young no way 
out was cast as the press photographer vicki vale but she was 
injured as filming began in england kim basinger came to the rescue 
i got a call on friday night in california that they wanted me 
monday morning and i said youre out of your mind basinger 
recalled to fly to london and be there sunday i said youve 
lost it ten minutes later i was on a plane in my mind i knew i 
would wind up doing it 
i got off the plane and started gathering wardrobe and doing 
the hundreds of things you need to do for a role i started making 
the character up as i went along 
i dont have an approach to anything i just dealt with this 
film as if i was making a dramatic piece vicki vale is the light of 
the movie its like phantom of the opera in the 80s tim burton 
the director said that its very much a light and dark film these 
two dark images and i am the light vicki vale brings the heart 
the reality to the film she asks batman do you love me thats 
all she cares about love 
she brings the normality the human aspect she grounds the 
boys when they get too feisty 
in this era of megabudgets the cost of batman has been 
reported from 35 million to 50 million the final word from 
producer peters not counting prints and advertising the actual 
cost was between 33 million and 35 million

fathers day card browsers faced a seemingly 
endless choice of saccharinsweet love messages and badtaste 
zingers this year tailored to senders ranging from firstborn 
children to adoptees 
the card glut reflects an effort by makers to capitalize on the 
timestrapped consumers quest for convenience theyre turning out 
more types of cards and cramming them into store space approaching 
saturation 
if you looked past the fathers day racks the categories go far 
beyond runofthemill anniversaries birthdays baptisms and bar 
mitvahs 
the holiday lineup has lengthened into a string spanning more 
days of the calendar christmas valentines day mothers day 
easter fathers day halloween and thanksgiving are the leaders 
but sweetest day mothersinlaw day and bosss day are getting 
space too 
no occasion is too obscure or private safesex friendship cards 
warn about the dangers of aids conventional getwell messages now 
include versions for the terminally ill 
one company recently unveiled a faxable greeting card betting 
that use of facsimile machines will get trendier than it already is 
in their zeal to satisfy every taste and circumstance card 
companies seem determined to make sure no one ever fumbles for words 
card sending may be a widely held habit partly because many 
people simply dont know how to express their thoughts in writing 
officials of the 3 billionayear card industry say 
nonetheless theyre not taking any chances on missing a market 
of literate card senders many supply artworkadorned versions with 
empty space for customers who have the time and inclination to write 
their own 
most buyers probably jot down a thought or two anyway 
supplementing the generic sentiments but even so some may feel 
guilty as they span the racks for something to send 
commentator andy rooney has put his feelings about greeting cards 
this way why are we buying someone elses words to convey 
supposedly intimate sentiments doesnt anyone just sit down with a 
blank piece of paper anymore and write a simple note to someone on a 
special occasion 
more often than not the answer is no 
industry analyst e gray glass iii of prudentialbache securities 
inc says consumers seem to be clamoring for alternative cards that 
are becoming more plentiful 
these nonoccasion cards appropriate any day are part of the 
industry push to develop new cardsending opportunities 
thats going to have the effect of expanding the per capita 
sending of cards says glass cards are also impulse purchases 
so the idea is that you should have as many types of cards available 
on the market as possible 
marianne mcdermott executive vice president of the greeting card 
association says consumers have become more demanding in choosing 
cards and makers have reacted nimbly to social change creating a 
cardchoice explosion 
people arent happy to pick up just any card it has to say 
just the right thing mcdermott says 
the challenge is that cards are proliferating but the growth in 
retail distributors has slowed to a crawl 
spacewise one of the few remaining cardselling opportunities 
is in mass merchandizing outlets and supermarkets 
food stores are the last to fill up says mcdermott 
theres still some room for expansion there 
american greetings corp the cleveland ohiobased company that 
ranks second to industry leader hallmark cards inc always has 
maintained a strong mass market presence its cards are carried in 
giant retailers such as sears roebuck and co k mart corp big 
discounters and drug chains 
spokesman john hernandis says american greetings is trying to 
enhance its good position within the mass volume retailing business 
responding to retailer needs its making shelf space more 
productive 
redesigned cabinets increase density accommodating more cards 
highvisibility locator signs make it easier for shoppers to find 
what they want 
helping shoppers locate desired cards has grown in importance 
partly because women who buy about 90 percent of the 7 billion 
greetings cards sold annually in the united states have less time 
to look many work fulltime 
american greetings also is emphasizing a concept called seasonal 
program marketing they did it first this past easter by grouping 
all easter merchandise cards party items giftwrapping and plush 
toys around a central theme bloomer bunny was the pitch rabbit 
for the stuff 
hernandis says the company intends to use this approach every 
holiday placing related merchandise readily at hand makes people 
more apt to buy 
you end up spending more buying more than you would 
normally says hernandis you may have your paper cups and paper 
plates but you may not be even thinking about streamers 
gibson greetings inc based in cincinnati ohio has found ways 
to increase card and related merchandise sales in supermarkets 
which now account for about 15 percent of annual sales industrywide 
vs about 7 percent in the early 1980s 
greg ionna vice president of marketing says gibson has 
identified several natural tieins between foods and cards 
valentines day cards have been placed in candy aisles puppy and 
kitten calendars have crept into pet food shelves and cards are 
appearing alongside flowers in grocerystore floral departments 
theres lots of opportunities we believe to cross merchandise 
with other products ionna says 
hallmark of kansas city mo dominates what it calls the social 
expression business with an estimated 42 percent of the market 
followed by american greetings with about 32 percent and 
thirdranked gibson with about 10 percent possibly as many as 1000 
other companies share the rest 
the rankings are only analysts best guesses because hallmark is 
a private company and doesnt disclose many financial details

the economic story of the coming decade will be 
written in three words brains over brawn 
in the 1990s and beyond knowhow and inventiveness will emerge 
as the keys to success in every field from selling hamburgers to 
fighting wars to forging steel 
the emergence of a knowledgebased world economy will create new 
winners but it also will create new losers people companies and 
countries that cant find a place in a world moving beneath their 
feet 
associated press writers from around the country found that the 
dawning knowledge economy is remaking societies and shifting the 
balance of global power those who exploit the trend are riding it 
to success those who do not are getting run over 
what weve had is a change in rewards for different kinds of 
skills you could think of it as brain power vs muscle power or 
paperandpencil skills vs other skills says harvard economist 
richard b freeman 
knowledge is not only power it is money and the erosion of 
american living standards directly reflects how the united states 
may be losing its postwar domination in the global knowledge game 
american earnings have stagnated and even fallen if youre a 
30yearold with a college degree youre making no more than your 
counterpart a decade ago after discounting for inflation if you 
dont have a college education youre making thousands of dollars a 
year less says economist frank levy of the university of maryland 
perhaps more importantly the knowledgemoney connection is 
widening the gap between rich and poor aggravating class tensions 
and leading indirectly to rising crime and drug abuse 
harvard mba grads can still walk into a 75000ayear junior 
investment bankers life on wall street but burgeoning illiteracy 
rates are leaving many youngsters with the feeling they have only 
two choices take a 335anhour dishwashers job or peddle drugs 
and risk jail 
the demand for knowledge permeates every aspect of life 
when michael jackson brings in laser technicians for his 
concerts he is plugging into the knowledge economy 
so is jesus frias who consults computergenerated personal 
profiles when he counsels crack addicts in brooklyn 
so are the iowans who make gummi bear candies for a west german 
company that set up shop in creston iowa to take advantage of an 
innovative job training program 
the potency of knowledge helps explain a lot of todays 
headlines from the crackdown on chinas studentled democracy 
movement to the surge in lawsuits over copyrights to congressional 
opposition to the fsx fighter deal with japan 
all around the world the struggle for power is becoming a battle 
of wits in the soviet union president mikhail gorbachev is 
pressing for glasnost and perestroika out of an awareness that his 
economic push will fail unless he can unlock the imaginations of the 
russian people 
in armonk ny international business machines corp is 
spending 900 million a year slightly more than the annual budget 
of harvard university to educate and train employees in everything 
from robotics to public speaking 
in miamis troubled liberty city frederick morley is trying to 
prepare the predominantly black poor students of drew elementary 
school for a hightech world that threatens to trap them in poverty 
the way out is education literacy and skills i think theyre 
listening the principal says 
the quintessential product of the new era software is nothing 
but a language of encoded knowledge traveling freely between 
computers economic visionaries say the people who can parlay their 
thoughts into this language hold the key to the creativity that will 
shape our future 
the major capital of the next century is going to be minds 
that produce ideas alan greenspan chairman of the federal 
reserve said in a recent speech to american and japanese executives 
the brainsoverbrawn trend is hardly new of course francis 
bacon observed in 1597 that knowledge is power whats new is that 
technology has made knowledge more mobile and infinitely more potent 
in the past year fiberoptic cables that carry information at 
the speed of light have been laid across the atlantic and pacific 
oceans for the first time its now possible for soviet scientists 
to plug directly into us scientific data networks by computer 
literacy rates have leaped in many developing countries allowing 
them to absorb technology quickly from the big industrial economies 
knowledge has become the great equalizer making it possible for 
anyone anywhere to compete and succeed unlike oil timber or 
nuclear bombs knowledge can be created and spread on a blackboard 
with a stub of chalk in bangkok thailand as easily as in omaha

for state and local governments education and aid to worker 
training are probably the biggest contributions they can make to 
their citizens ability to cope 
west germanys mederer corp for example makes trolli gummi 
candies in iowa under a state program that reimburses a company up 
to 50 percent of a new workers salary and benefits for onthejob 
training 
it was a major factor in locating the plant manager gary 
buck says 
in the private sector meanwhile a new kind of democracy is 
emerging a belief in lifelong selfimprovement and a commitment to 
the principle that anyone can have a good idea 
a potentially harmful countertrend also is bubbling up however 
in the name of efficiency and uniformity some companies are 
deskilling the jobs of fastfood laborers reservation clerks 
and even bankers and social workers removing their flexibility with 
rules concocted by centralized experts 
yankee ingenuity is still admired around the globe but the 
deskilling movement is expanding too fed by the management search 
to exert control and avoid the vulnerability of relying on 
illeducated workers 
extraordinary human ingenuity has been used to eliminate the 
need for human ingenuity author barbara garson writes in a 1988 
book the electronic sweatshop 
we call it cloning your best man says george keller 
executive vice president of afsm international an association of 
hightech field service workers 
keller says he likes the new systems which allow generalists to 
do specialized repairs by following rules stored in a laptop 
computer but he also worries people could become overly dependent 
on them 
people like to use crutches sometimes he said 
there is no reason the knowledge economy must lead to drudgery 
in fact the assemblyline mentality catching on in some offices is 
disappearing in the factories where it began 
respect for peoples ideas at ls electrogalvanizing co in 
cleveland for example has led to a dramatic surge in pride among 
the companys workers who make sheet steel for auto bodies 
wes humphrey vice president of united steelworkers local 9126 at 
the plant says the esprit de corps there is so strong that now we 
wrap coils like its christmastime 
many managers recognize this lesson if we dont work with our 
employees to make them happier and get more work out of them were 
all doomed says david hoag president of ltv steel co one of 
lss corporate parents which got religion during its chapter 11 
bankruptcy proceedings 
for companies that reject the deskilling approach to survival 
the alternative is shouldering more of the burden of education that 
will pinch smaller businesses that cant spare 18000 people at a 
time the number of ibmers who receive education or training on a 
typical day 
by the year 2000 65 percent of all jobs will require some 
training or education beyond high school compared with 54 percent 
now according to a study by the american society for training and 
development 
many companies complain that their training will go to waste 
because newly trained workers will jump to jobs elsewhere that is 
indeed a problem since good training is so spotty still training 
pays 
in a study for the national academy of engineering charles w 
hoover of new yorks polytechnic university concluded that education 
outlays for engineers are among the best investments even in the 
short term 
for workers or those hoping to find jobs the keys are lifelong 
education and flexibility 
increasingly were in a more complex economy and that is 
making for more complex and more demanding jobs says samuel 
ehrenhalt regional commissioner for the us bureau of labor 
statistics 
unfortunately for those who want to adapt its getting tougher 
american society is splintering into a small segment of overworked 
technology wizards a great mass of people who know just enough to 
get by and another small but growing segment mired in permanent 
poverty the underclass 
fourteen percent of american adults cannot locate the united 
states on a map about one in five believes the sun revolves around 
the earth most young adults cannot decipher a bus schedule a 
department of education survey found 
while american educators struggle to cultivate the seeds of 
modern knowledge in this country foreign literacy is flourishing 
japanese automakers that opened us plants found they had to 
hire college graduates to fill assembly jobs that would have been 
filled by high school graduates in japan 
americans still win a disproportionate share of nobel prizes in 
science but by most other measures the top of the knowledge pyramid 
is eroding as badly as the base 
last year eight of the top 10 winners of us patents were 
foreign companies half the assistant professors of engineering at 
us graduate schools are foreign 
as the us economy becomes more closely tied to the global one 
the winners will be those people whose services for whatever 
reason are in world demand that includes movie stars athletes 
lawyers and specialists like michael milken the junk bond king 
losers are those whose jobs can be done abroad dataentry jobs 
are moving to farflung locales from northern ireland to china some 
credit card and insurance companies have their billing statements 
done in the caribbean boeing co has had programming done in the 
philippines 
norman bodek executive director of the data entry management 
association of stamford conn was prophetic when he proclaimed 
three years ago that eventually an office in india will be no 
different than next door 
perhaps the biggest direct threat to ordinary americans is that 
the knowledge economy could permanently split the population and 
undermine any reason for the winners to help the losers the 
alienation and political consequences of that gulf are profound 
as our economic fates diverge harvard professor robert reich 
wrote recently the top fifth may be losing the sense of 
connectedness with the bottom fifth or even the bottom half that 
would elicit such generosity

crack addicts who used to spill their life 
stories to jesus frias in a basement office of a brooklyn hospital 
are now telling them to a computer instead 
the traditional intake interview through which the drug 
counselor gained insight into a new patient has been replaced by a 
multiplechoice questionnaire that the patient fills out alone 
a computer program converts the patients answers to the 132 
questions into a narrative a formulaic twopage biography 
frias 34 said he understands why computers have taken over the 
initial interviews for one thing they give counselors more time 
for other meetings with patients but he said something is lost 
without that first facetoface contact 
when you ask the question is your father or mother alive and 
they say yes even that yes tells you a lot you can say you dont 
sound too happy your fathers alive 
the automation of some phases of addiction counseling is part of 
a streamlining and simplification of jobs everywhere made possible 
by technology and sophisticated management techniques critics call 
it dumbing down 
wisecracking shortorder cooks are disappearing from the american 
scene replaced by drones who answer to french fry computers 
electronic monitoring is squeezing out the folksy airline 
reservation clerks who tell callers that vancouver is nice this time 
of year 
even stockbrokers those cowboys of finance are getting lassoed 
some big firms now decide centrally how and where clients should 
invest their money reducing brokers to happytalking functionaries 
office automation is rising almost floor by floor to engulf 
higher and higher strata of whitecollar workers barbara garson 
wrote in a 1988 book the electronic sweatshop 
turning human work over to computers is not an inescapable part 
of the emerging knowledge economy many companies are moving in the 
other direction trying to gain a competitive edge by encouraging 
employees to think independently 
but there are powerful social forces behind human automation 
including a shortage of skilled workers and managements innate 
desire for greater control 
counselors and administrators at the poly drug clinic of kings 
county addictive hospital say the computerization of intake 
interviews has brought greater efficiency and uniformity 
the questionnaire developed by auto assess inc asks for 
example how much patients spend daily for drugs and what they do in 
their spare time 
another companys psychological screening inventory requires 
patients to answer true or false to statements such as i enjoy 
classical music strange voices have spoken to me and 
shooting is a good sport 
computers translate the answers into neat statements containing 
sentences such as client feels she is a normal drinker 
counselors are supposed to plug holes with a personal interview 
when interviews were done in person the writeups tended to be 
messy and incomplete especially when done by the lesseducated 
counselors hired at a time when it was in vogue to use former 
addicts in rehabilitation they also took two hours or more to do 
right 
its a finite instrument like all but the purpose is to save 
us time for the counselor said the clinic director jerry 
halloran 
the downside of it would be a counselor getting this back and 
filing it away and never looking at it he said 
crack the highly addictive smokable form of cocaine is 
ravaging poor neighborhoods of brooklyn the success rate for 
treatment is low especially in an outpatient clinic like the poly 
drug clinic knowing a patient well can help a counselor head off 
predictable trouble frias said 
the computerized reports are sometimes adequate sometimes not 
frias said he fears they could be a temptation to laziness and by 
saving counselors time they give budgeters a rationale for not 
adding more counselors to cope with an increased load of crack 
addicts 
youre removing the need for skilled people now you just need 
people to file frias said 
overall frias concludes the computerization is probably good in 
any case he said once its introduced and people notice its 
convenient nobody wants to do more work youre not going to go 
back to the old way

if theres one thing american automakers 
should be able to do better than japanese rivals its knowing the 
styles american drivers like 
but japans automakers set out to eliminate that advantage by 
establishing design shops in that carcrazed corner of america 
southern california theyve turned out the snazzy prototypes for 
bestsellers like mazdas mx5 miata nissans pathfinder 4x4 
hondas crx and toyotas celica 
the americandesigned japanese cars were so successful that 
detroit was forced to follow suit with its own california design 
studios 
as is increasingly the case in the knowledge economy the big 
three us carmakers found that to stay in the race even in their 
own backyard they have to get smarter about giving consumers what 
they want 
they were too insulated from the popular culture they were 
still living mentally and psychologically in the bloomfield hills 
country club said tony assenza senior editor of car and driver 
magazine speaking of a wealthy detroit suburb 
in the united states everybody looks here for trends said 
hiroshi moriyoshi who heads mazdas southern california design and 
research outpost the whole environment is conducive to 
creativity 
cars are so similar in price and technology that style has become 
more important than ever hence the 14 auto design studios within 
120 freeway miles of los angeles 
detroit for years kept an eye on how californians customize cars 
and hired californiatrained designers part of a watch on trends 
nationwide 
but the japanese were the first to actually set up shop here 
beginning with toyota motor corps calty design research inc in 
newport beach in 1973 honda motor co ltd followed in 1974 with a 
shop in torrance mazda motor corp in 1976 in irvine and nissan 
motor co ltd in 1979 in la jolla 
the studios were small lowprofile seemingly unthreatening 
then the 1978 celica hit the carshow circuit catching the eye 
of auto enthusiasts who tended to look at most japanese products as 
dull compacts meant for the budgetminded 
the japanese companies managed to make compacts stylish turning 
out sporty younglooking cars that young people could afford 
detroit was left wallowing behind 
it was a mindset predicated on the fact that the main car of 
interest to anybody they talked to was a sixpassenger fourdoor 
luxury automobile roughly in the shape of a brick assenza said 
detroit established satellite design studios or beefed up 
informal sampling of the tastes out west 
chrysler corps pacific advanced product design center in 
carlsbad and general motors corps advanced concepts center in 
newbury park sprang up in 1983 followed a year later by ford 
concept center california in valencia 
other japanese makers plus volvo and three independents bring 
the number of design studios in the area to 14 most employ fewer 
than 50 
the japanese had intensely practical reasons for setting up 
design shops in southern california the west coast was already 
their business beachhead in america and the weather was far more 
agreeable than detroits 
but it turns out they landed in the most wideopen auto market in 
the world where designers can sample trends just driving to work 
its the best automotive design melting pot that i can think 
of said fritz mayhew chief design executive at ford motor co in 
detroit who oversees the contributions of the companys california 
designers 
then theres californias role as a crucible of popular culture 
fads trends do start here said ron hill head of the 
industrial design program at the art center college of design in 
pasadena where many car designers get their start people are 
less inhibited to look at the new to express themselves in ways 
theyre not so capable of doing in other parts of the country or the 
world 
among the auto trends traced to california hot rods pickup 
trucks as basic commuter transportation convertible pickups trim 
and grillwork thats painted not chromed the new emphasis on 
comfortable interiors 
nissans pulsar nx a compact with interchangeable tops that 
makes it a convertible a pickup or a station wagon emerged in 
production almost unchanged from the design said gerald hirshberg 
a former gm designer who heads the companys studio in la jolla 
the same was true for the companys brawny americanlooking 
pathfinder 4x4 and hardbody pickups 
mazdas studio employs designers from japan the united states 
and taiwan several have worked in europe 
nissans hirshberg has found the japanese admire their american 
coworkers willingness to take risks in design while the americans 
are taken aback by the japanese ability to translate a design into a 
practical car 
theres a kind of subtle collaboration that can only happen 
when parts of both cultures are put in the frying pan hirshberg 
said you get a tremendous energy burst when you tap into what 
each culture does better

by midmorning it was business as usual in miamis 
liberty city district 
a kid on a fancy bicycle ferried crack cocaine past a housing 
project where the bulletriddled body of a 34yearold mother was 
discovered before dawn a squad car screamed by blue lights 
pulsing the owner of a furniture store that had been looted in last 
januarys riots waited at the door for customers he was armed 
inside a small concreteblock building set apart from the drew 
elementary school students in blue and white uniforms were told 
their future is not necessarily foreshadowed by eve 
side of the chainlink fence 
we let them know there are alternatives to drugs to poverty 
to criments on the other said drew principal frederick morley the 
way out is 
education literacy and skills i think theyre listening 
the success of educators like morley is vital not only to the 
people of liberty city but to the nation as a whole 
as labor shortages arise companies are hiring people from 
disadvantaged backgrounds out of necessity not philanthropy at the 
same time the knowledgebased economy demands more sophisticated 
skills than ever 
morley and otherose round white face 
and shaggy mustache seems more suited to an irish pub than a ghetto 
streetcorner 
im just trying to provide the tools the education to move 
in the right direction said mann a university of miami professor 
who founded the entrepreneurial institute in response to liberty 
city riots in 1982 
the 15 fiveweek courses include accounting international 
business and business computer software about twothirds of the 
2500 students who have taken them since 1983 are black 
theres an amazing resilience in the human species the body 
and mind only lets you go so far into destitution then the sense of 
survival takes over mann said thats what were hoping to tap 
into that sense that the black community will claw back against 
the odds 
education alone will not get blacks into the economic mainstream 
in miami among other things they face discrimination from white 
and hispanic businesses and a deterioration of the social fabric in 
black communities 
listen ill hire anyone but it seems the ones who can and 
want to work are the haitians and the latins said charles 
genthner president of fire hose corp which makes fire hoses in a 
1yearold liberty city plant 
there has to be the idea that getting into the work force is 
the best option said john cordrey an economist at the beacon 
council a taxsupported miami area business group 
in my opinion the blacks have made the hispanics a scapegoat 
they see them working hard and they say they are taking our jobs 
said thomas boswell a university of miami professor studying local 
immigration what is really plaguing the black community here is a 
breakdown in the family 
identifying the problem is easy turning it around is 
difficult

president bushs bounceback veto of the 
minimum wage bill sets the issue and draws the line for a series of 
volleys between the white house and the new democratic team in 
congress 
the dispute will be around for a while although it isnt likely 
to intrude on the broader bipartisanship both sides have pledged on 
the minimum wage each side is determined to prove cooperation 
doesnt mean it can be pushed around 
it is an issue on which traditional democratic and republican 
philosophies clash and have for 50 years that is not going to 
change whatever the outcome of the current round 
this bill would increase the minimum wage by an excessive 
amount and thus stifle the creation of new job opportunities bush 
said in his first veto message one hed waited weeks to deliver 
it would accelerate inflation 
he said that instead of helping the lowest paid workers it 
would cost jobs about 400000 by white house estimate 
democrats dispute each point insisting the minimum be raised to 
provide the working poor anything close to a living wage their 
debaters denounced bush as a skinflint bent on denying the poor a 
measly three dimes an hour 
the vetoed bill would have raised the minimum to 455 an hour 
over the next 2 12 years bush said he wouldnt go beyond 425 
the current rate is 335 unchanged since 1981 
bush said the difference wasnt just 30 cents an hour that 
the argument is about the best way to preserve jobs 
each side accused the other of political posturing before the 
house sustained the veto on wednesday the vote was 247 to 178 
short by 34 of the twothirds needed to override bush 
nobody was surprised nobody will be 
it is the most clearly identifiable issue on which a majority 
of the two parties have disagreed over and over again over the 
years said rep william d ford dmich it doesnt matter who 
the president is 
president reagan wouldnt agree to any increase so it was on 
hold throughout his administration 
during the 1988 campaign bush supported an increase coupled 
with a training wage although he didnt say how much when he did 
say the veto line was set 
then the political maneuvering began 
the senate passed the final version of the bill on may 17 making 
it ready for the white house where bush was promising a veto faster 
than the eye can see 
for nearly a month nothing happened as the democrats held the 
bill waiting for an opportune moment 
sen bob dole the republican leader said it was being held 
hostage by democrats so that they can travel around the country 
and bash the president 
the veto message was written and ready all it needed was a date 
and a presidential signature the traveling white house took the 
message along on the presidents weeklong european trip 
but as dole complained the democrats wouldnt send bush 
something to veto 
they finally did on tuesday while bush was out of town bush 
chief of staff john h sununu said when the bill got to the white 
house it would hit the wall and bounce back like a rubber ball 
it did within 20 minutes faster than the democratic leadership 
could foresee 
at the time the president was aboard air force one between 
jackson wyo and lincoln neb he signed one copy of the veto 
message while the bill was returned to the house with another copy 
bearing his facsimile signature 
he said it was excessive complained rep pat williams 
dmont he said that while he was flying at 30000 feet in air 
force one above americas lowincome workers 
while white house aide david kalbaugh was delivering the veto 
message to capitol hill democratic leaders assembled for a final 
appeal to bush not to reject the bill before they could start he 
had so they rewrote their scripts to denounce the veto 
now theyve got to figure out what to do about it 
the president should know that this issue will not go away 
said senate democratic leader george mitchell sen edward m 
kennedy reintroduced the vetoed bill but said he was willing to 
compromise 
house republicans proposed a combination minimum wagetax credit 
plan for low income families 
democrats said they had only begun to fight 
all of that raises the prospect of more talk and more stalemate 
the democrats dont have enough votes to override a veto and bush 
doesnt have the votes to get his own version through congress 
so the speechmaking will go on despite the apt capsule 
appraisal rep harris w fawell rill provided during the house 
debate im not sure that many of us are listening at all he 
said

if youre breathing somebody elses cigarette 
smoke at home or work you risk far more than watery eyes or a runny 
nose a controversial new study suggests passive smoking may be one 
of the leading preventable causes of death the study should 
escalate the battle over indoor smoking restrictions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
alice trillin was 38 years old and in excellent 
health she thought then this completely crazy thing happened 
i coughed and a tiny tiny blood clot took me to get a chest 
xray ten days later i had my lung removed 
trillin had lung cancer the kind smokers get 
but she had never smoked a cigarette 
the cause of her cancer remained a mystery until a doctor friend 
asked if her parents had smoked yes trillin told him they smoked 
heavily 
nobody had ever said anything about passive smoking i hadnt 
worried about the question much she says 
most scientists hadnt worried about the question much either 
until studies in recent years showed that passive smoking was 
causing 3000 to 5000 lung cancer deaths a year in nonsmokers now 
a study estimates that the toll from passive smoking including 
deaths from heart disease and other cancers may be 10 times that 
tobacco smoke in the home and workplace could be killing 46000 
nonsmokers each year in the united states the study concludes 
thats 3000 lung cancer deaths 11000 from other cancers and 
32000 heart disease deaths 
that would make passive smoking the leading preventable cause of 
death after alcohol and smoking itself said dr ronald m davis 
director of the us office on smoking and health smoking kills 
390000 alcohol 120000 
no longer are we talking about runny nose or watery eyes or 
headache or nausea but a fatal disease said davis which ups 
the ante so to speak for passive smoking 
passive smoking has become the principal battleground for the 
tobacco industry and its opponents in the 1980s it is no longer 
merely a health issue but political and environmental cigarette 
pollution is fouling the air 
we know that the indoor environment is far more polluted than 
the outdoor environment said james repace of the environmental 
protection agency indoor air program weve seen that again and 
again wherever weve looked all over the united states 
many people believe smokers have the right to smoke but they 
also believe that others shouldnt have to pay a price 
when you talk about an involuntary risk the society becomes 
much more cautious said university of californiasan francisco 
biomedical engineer stanton glantz an environmentalist and 
antismoking activist 
the new estimate is controversial researchers agree it is 
preliminary and needs to be confirmed 
a tobacco industry consultant said the emphasis on passive 
smoking was misplaced environmental tobacco smoke is a 
smokescreen that is keeping us from looking at the total problem 
which is the quality of indoor air said dr david weeks 
president of permed corp a health consulting firm in boise 
idaho you take the tobacco smoke out of the air and youve still 
got the problem 
many public health officials disagree 
the risk of tobacco smoke is greater than the risk of radon gas 
is to nonsmokers said repace were talking maybe 40 percent 
greater and if youre talking about all the carcinogenic air 
pollutants that epa regulates its 100 times greater 
epa researchers in north carolina say in a new internal report 
that environmental tobacco smoke is a major source of indoor air 
pollution and is also the major combustion source contributing to 
total human exposure to mutagens and carcinogens 
the passive smoking issue poses a serious threat to the tobacco 
industry a confidential opinion poll done for the industry in 1978 
and leaked to antismoking activists showed passive smoking was 
the most dangerous development to the viability of the tobacco 
industry that has yet occurred 
what the smoker does to himself may be his business but what 
the smoker does to the nonsmoker is quite a different matter the 
pollsters concluded 
concern about passive smoking escalated in 1986 with two reports 
the us surgeon general concluded that passive smoking doesnt 
merely raise the risk of lung cancer it causes it and the 
national academy of sciences said exposure to tobacco smoke may 
raise the risk of lung cancer in nonsmokers 34 percent 
alice trillin was lucky she was cured but lung cancer remains 
one of the most difficult cancers to treat few others will have her 
luck 
the link between passive smoking and lung cancer is based on four 
lines of evidence said davis whose office on smoking and health 
prepares the surgeon generals reports on smoking 
first tobacco smoke contains known cancercausing agents 
second nonsmokers absorb smoke from the air byproducts can be 
measured in their blood third theres no safe level of exposure to 
smoke fourth many studies show that nonsmokers whose spouses 
smoke have a higher risk of lung cancer than nonsmokers whose 
spouses dont 
at the end of 1987 42 states had imposed some restrictions on 
smoking in public more than double the number in the early 1970s 
said davis thirtytwo states restrict smoking in the workplace 
the nations two largest airquality agencies the epa and the 
california air resources board are preparing assessments of the 
danger of passive smoking both have included the new estimate in 
their calculations 
the estimate comes from a study published in the december issue 
of environment international by a judson wells a researcher in 
wilmington del and a volunteer with the american lung association 
in general we dont think dr wells is going to be off base at 
all said margaret jenkins coordinator of the indoor air quality 
program for the california air resources board 
the papers findings on lung cancer agree with other studies its 
findings on heart disease and other cancers are more speculative 
but plausible repace said the largest source of death from 
active smoking is of course heart disease we know the arteries of 
smokers get plugged up very rapidly and it is very possible that 
these same effects could occur in passive smokers 
wells said he himself was surprised by his estimate when i 
first calculated these numbers they scared the hell out of me id 
be the first to admit theyre wrong if we can find out why theyre 
wrong 
so far no one has although not everyone accepts wells estimate 
weeks the industry consultant dismissed wells study as he 
does concern about passive smoking altogether he believes passive 
smoking causes no risk but he doesnt think any of the data on the 
subject are very good 
many researchers would agree that current estimates are imprecise 
but repace answers weeks this way environmental tobacco smoke 
is tobacco smoke and tobacco smoke is known to cause 400000 deaths 
a year here is a known carcinogen to human beings are we to assume 
that low levels are innocuous the question is what standard of 
proof you require before you take public action 
the risk to a nonsmoker in a typical office is about the same as 
the risk for a nonsmoker whose spouse smokes he said in a 
typical office with good ventilation youre running about 250 times 
the maximum acceptable cancer risk for environmental carcinogens in 
air or water or food 
that is among 100000 workers youd expect 250 of them to die 
from lung cancer caused by passive smoking and in the poorly 
ventilated office it would be four times as high repace said 
occasional exposure in a bar restaurant or car probably is not 
nearly as great a risk as exposure in the home or the office he 
said 
most of the regulatory emphasis now is on curbing smoke in the 
workplace its one of the two most important places of exposure 
to tobacco smoke the other being the home davis said for 
somebody who doesnt have any smokers in the home the worksite 
would be the most important place 
even many smokers favor policies that curb the passive smoking 
risk 
according to the 1989 surgeon generals report on smoking 64 
percent of smokers believe their habit is hazardous to nonsmokers 
health thirtyfour percent of smokers were bothered by other 
peoples smoking 
the question for nonsmokers is how aggressively to avoid tobacco 
smoke 
im sure one days exposure isnt going to do you any harm 
said wells but every little bit adds to what youve accumulated 
heretofore 
only the most sensitive individuals are going to die of passive 
smoking the problem is we dont know who they are it could be you 
it could be me

davis calif ap when a bug starts to eat a tomato it seems 
the fruit tries to counterattack by releasing chemicals to stunt the 
insects growth 
the mechanism fails because the chemicals counteract each other 
but the discovery holds promise for biological alternatives to 
insecticides said sean s duffey a university of california 
davis entomologist plants might be genetically engineered to give 
them defenses against bugs he said 
duffey and his colleagues studied larvae of the tomato fruitworm 
and beet armyworm some of the worms were raised on artificial 
diets while others were raised on tomato plants duffey measured 
the growth of the worms and monitored the chemical properties of the 
worms and the tomato plants 
when tomato cells were damaged by an insect they released 
chemicals called proteinase inhibitors which interfered with the 
insects digestion of protein the damage also allowed chemicals 
called phenolics to react with others known as polyphenol oxidase 
enzymes that let the phenolics bind up protein in the tomato so 
it was less available for the insect to digest 
laboratory tests indicated that these reactions individually 
are potent defenses dramatically decreasing the growth rate of the 
worms a university news release said however duffeys work 
shows that these two methods of defense work at cross purposes so 
the insects can eat with impunity

bacteria could offer an inexpensive 
method of cleaning up explosives storage sites say researchers who 
already have found a naturally occurring organism that can break 
down nitroglycerin 
for every dollar spent on this method it will take between 10 
and 100 with socalled dump truck technology hauling off the 
explosives and burning or burying them said pat unkefer of los 
alamos national laboratory 
unkefer and her husband cliff both biochemists found a 
bacteria that breaks down nitroglycerin into water and carbon 
dioxide the unkefers and technologist john hanners say it will be 
more complicated to find microbes capable of degrading tnt and other 
explosives that are more complex than nitroglycerine 
they say bacteria applied to explosivestainted soil could 
degrade the toxic substances into harmless residue in as little as 
six months 
the researchers collect bacteria samples near munitions plants 
and explosives staging sites return them to the laboratory and grow 
them in a culture with nitroglycerin to isolate those with an 
ability to live off the normally toxic explosive

a rock painting discovered in new mexico 
last year provides more support for researchers who believe american 
indians witnessed the extremely bright explosion of a star 935 years 
ago 
many anthropologists are skeptical that 11thcentury indians 
would have recorded the supernova even though it appeared twice as 
bright as the planet venus but the rock painting or petroglyph is 
at least the 22nd example found in the west since the 1950s of 
american indian art depicting a bright object near a crescent moon 
said university of colorado astronomer jack brandt 
the latest was found by amateur astronomers from illinois in new 
mexicos chaco canyon which may have been a pueblo sunwatching 
site brandt said 
only two of the 22 rock paintings or carvings have been ruled out 
as records of the gargantuan blast in the year ad 1054 he said 
ancient chinese and japanese historical records reported the 
exploding star that formed the crab nebula was visible for 653 
nights and in daylight for 23 consecutive days 
astronomical calculations show that a crescent moon next to the 
supernova would have been visible only from what is now the western 
united states he said no planets or other bright objects would 
have been near a crescent moon during the 11th century in western 
north america 
crescent moons are rare in indian rock art supporting the 
argument that the indians saw and made artistic records of the 
supernova almost every time crescent moon rock art is found 
there is a bright object depicted near it brandt said 
such depictions have been found in arizona california new 
mexico texas utah and baja california mexico

oceanographers hope to learn more about the 
structure of the earth with the help of a new portable drill to bore 
holes in the ocean floor 
its a tool that weve needed badly said don pryor part of 
a federal team exploring the economic potential of the ocean floor 
this new drill will give us the opportunity to get cores from the 
deep sea which we simply have had no means of getting before 
the new drill to be built in august takes advantage of 
stateofthe art mining technology and laboratory drilling 
techniques it can operate as deep as 18000 feet and was designed 
to be handled with a 068inch cable standard on research ships 
that is strong enough to lift the oneton rig placement will be 
controlled by a sonicnavigation network and a remote tv camera 
the drill was developed by mike williamson a marine consultant 
who got a small national science foundation grant in 1982 for 
preliminary designs five subsequent attempts to finance a prototype 
failed but a sixth with university of washington oceanographer paul 
johnson won a 400000 grant from the nsf and another 100000 from 
the office of naval research 
the prototype will drill a precisely oriented 1inch hole 10 
feet into seabed rock the next stage would be a drill that could 
secure a 160foot core 
scientists are also looking at uses for the holes the drill will 
leave behind for example seismologists may place instruments 
firmly attached to the holes rock sides to detect oceanbottom 
earthquakes 
the current conventional deepsea research drilling effort 
managed by joint oceanographic institutions for deep earth sampling 
lowers drilling pipe from a well in the bottom of a specialized 
vessel 
the new drill which can be lowered from any ship will be 
smarter than current drills which cannot be adjusted from the 
surface once they are running pryor part of a us geological 
surveynational oceanic and atmospheric administration project to 
map the united states economic zone extending 200 miles offshore 
said portability is the real merit of this new drill and the fact 
that it will be relatively inexpensive compared to bringing in the 
drilling ship probably less than onetenth the cost

its possible to get an ivy league education without ivy league 
costs 
good public colleges with private school ambience and advantages 
can be found according to education experts 
there are a number of small public institutions that are 
rapidly reaching the standards of the little private ivys says 
richard moll who has served in admissions administration at harvard 
and yale universities and has written a book the public ivys 
these small public colleges usually have high quality students 
and faculty small classes rigorous curriculum an intellectual 
atmosphere and personal attention to students campus population 
averages about 3000 which works out to about 22 students in each 
class 
moll says tuition costs at these colleges range between 850 and 
1500 per year for instate students 2500 to 4000 for 
outofstaters room and board typically come to about 3000 this 
contrasts with private school tuition and fees which averaged 
12526 in l98889 
nearly two thirds of public college students receive financial 
aid averaging 2800 a year while the same proportion at private 
schools receives an average of 6000 
some of the schools mentioned by moll and another author martin 
nemko include evergreen state college at olympia wash st marys 
college of st marys city md the university of north carolina at 
asheville northeast missouri state university at kirksville ramapo 
college in ramapo nj mary washington college in fredericksburg

the state university of new york at geneseo and the university of 
minnesota at morris 
nemko a former new york city teacher who is now an education 
consultant and author of how to get an ivy league education at a 
state university cites st marys college in maryland as a 
decent copy of an elite new england private liberal arts college 
that will cost you 50000 less than the original 
the university of north carolinaasheville was rated in a recent 
survey by the association of american colleges as having one of the 
strongest humanities core curriculums in the country 
the national governors association has called ramapo college a

us banks must be allowed into the securities 
business if the united states is to compete successfully against 
europe and japan federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan told 
a congressional panel 
greenspan testifying wednesday before the senate banking 
subcommittee on securities said the 55yearold glasssteagall law 
which separated commercial banking from the securities industry is 
hampering us institutions from competing in what is becoming an 
increasingly global financial system 
there is no question we are being significantly suppressed by 
the glasssteagall restrictions greenspan said 
my concern is that as we continue to internationalize that 
we are in effect inhibiting our institutions from fully 
participating in that he said 
last year the senate with federal reserve support 
overwhelmingly passed legislation granting banks broad new 
securities powers but the bill died in the house 
had we had congressional passage of the bill that passed the 
senate last year i would argue our competitive capabilities in the 
world market would be significantly enhanced greenspan said 
treasury undersecretary robert glauber said in a speech last 
month that the administration intends to revive its push to revamp 
glasssteagall later this year 
sen christopher j dodd dconn chairman of the subcommittee 
said his panel will turn its attention to the issue once congress 
passes president bushs savings and loan bailout 
its unacceptable to most americans that we should end up 
playing second fiddle in financial services dodd said he said 
only one us banking company citicorp is among the worlds 10 
largest and only one securities firm shearson lehman hutton inc 
is among the five biggest 
banks in great britain and west germany already have securities 
powers but sen james r sasser dtenn noted that japanese banks 
have managed to retain their world standing even though they operate 
under restrictions similar to the glasssteagall law 
greenspan replied that japanese banks lag in profitability but 
not size and he noted that japan is moving to reform its banking 
laws 
i should trust we wouldnt be the laggard in that area the

strong spending by national advertisers and an 
improving economic climate were cited as a prominent forecaster 
raised his estimate of us ad spending growth this year to 69 
percent 
that still would leave growth in domestic ad spending below the 
rises of 74 percent to 79 percent posted in each of the past four 
years and well below the doubledigit increases earlier in the 
decade 
but robert coen director of forecasting for the ad agency 
mccannerickson said wednesday that domestic ad spending growth for 
this year should exceed the 61 percent rise he projected last 
december 
national marketers ad budgets are now keeping pace with 
economic growth and although local retail activity is still 
depressed signs of gradual improvement are becoming evident he 
said 
he said magazines radio cable tv and syndicated programing were 
seeing biggerthanexpected ad growth but that expected growth for 
newspapers was dismal and network television ad revenues would 
barely exceed last years results 
he said total us ad spending should reach 1262 billion this 
year up from 1181 billion in 1988 
spending by national advertisers was expected to rise 76 percent 
to 706 billion while local ad spending was expected to grow 6 
percent to 556 billion six months ago coen forecast a 65 
percent rise in national ad spending and a 56 percent increase in 
local ad spending 
none of the percentage increases is adjusted for inflation coen 
expects the economy to grow at a 75 percent clip this year 
including inflation 
at a news conference coen said the falloff that traditionally 
follows an election and olympic games year may not be as sharp as he 
had expected domestic ad spending rose 77 percent in 1988 
some marketers beef up their ad spending in connection with the 
olympics election years mean regular advertisers must compete with 
political candidates for commercial time and space 
in 1985 for example domestic ad spending growth tumbled to 79 
percent from 151 percent in the election and olympic year of 1984 
network television ad revenues were off 4 percent in the first 
four months of this year compared with the same period in 1988 but 
coen expects a 1 percent rise for the full year 
he said abcs revenues were off 23 percent compared with last 
year when it broadcast the winter olympics but ad revenue was up 5 
percent at cbs and 10 percent at nbc in the first four months of 
1989 
as the year unfolds the comparisons will improve until the 
months corresponding to last years summer olympics telecast he 
said 
among the big network advertisers coen said fastfood marketers 
boosted spending by 29 percent in the first quarter after an 18 
percent rise last year advertising spending on cable tv syndicated 
programming magazines and radio all were stronger than expected he 
said direct mail and yellow pages advertising are expected to grow 
10 percent each 
but coen said the growth prospects for newspapers were quite 
dismal projecting a 5 percent rise in local ad spending and a 3 
percent increase in national ad spending local retail lineage was 
down in the first quarter and local classified lineage looks 
terrible in comparison with last years highs he said 
local ad spending growth also remains sluggish he said 
coen said ad spending overseas was expected to grow faster than 
domestic ad spending for the fifth consecutive year but he scaled 
back his december estimate to 10 percent from 12 percent foreign ad 
spending is expected to reach 1335 billion in 1989 
in first estimate of growth for 1990 coen said he expects us 
ad spending to grow 7 percent to 136 billion next year while 
foreign ad spending rises 9 percent to 146 billion

lisa hart a single parent getting by as a fastfood worker at an 
oklahoma city hardees said she was looking forward to a good pay 
raise until president bush vetoed the minimum wage bill 
lee soule who owns a small restaurant in san francisco said he 
too believes the minimum wage should be increased and is sorry the 
president vetoed the bill 
ms hart and soule were among workers and managers queried by the 
associated press on wednesday following bushs veto of a measure to 
gradually raise the current 335 hourly minimum to 455 democrats 
in congress tried to override the veto but fell short of the 
twothirds majority needed to do so 
out in the saloons and restaurants and pet shops where the issue 
has the most impact opinion was mixed but most people on both the 
management and labor side agreed the current minimum is not enough 
people have to understand how treacherous it is to try and live 
on 335 an hour said soule who pays waiters at his midscale 
pacific cafe the california hourly minimum of 425 
ms hart who makes more than the current minimum but less than 
455 was asked if 335 is a livable wage 
no way she said the most you could do is pay your 
utilities or your mortgage 
her manager anita feeley said starting workers at the 
restaurant now get 365 an hour she said she didnt think 
employers would lay off workers if the wage were raised to 455 
but they might become warier about whom they hired 
in seattle shari hudson said the tips she receives at benjamins 
restaurant bring in about three times as much as her wage of 385 
an hour the minimum in washington state the proposed raise she 
said might pay the tax on our tips 
interviews at restaurants in seattle yakima and spokane wash 
plus a dry cleaning shop a pub and a beauty supply store in the 
state turned up no businesses that said they were paying the minimum 
wage 
in maine the story was much the same the state minimum is 375 
an hour but in many areas the starting scale is well above that 
theres just too much competition around here said pamela 
potter staffing coordinator for four mcdonalds restaurants 
in boston also it was hard to find minimum wage workers 
fastfood restaurants are advertising for employees at 6 or 7 an 
hour and dishwashers in chinatown start at 5 according to a 
restaurant owner 
i can see minimum wage for kids in high school but if youre 
living alone theres no way no way you can do it on 335 an 
hour said christopher long a 23yearold bostonian leaning 
against the bumper of his black 1989 jeep with a broad smile and 
rayban sunglasses on his face long said he would not consider a 
job at less than 6 
in ocean city nj roy gillian owner of wonderland pier said 
in the northeast it has no effect because we couldnt get 
anybody for 335 
vera kelly 49 of queens who works behind the lunch counter at 
lamstons a five and dime store in manhattan said even 455 
still wouldnt support a family it should be even more than 
that 
few workers believed employers would be forced to lay off people 
if the minimum were raised 
youve got to have help said mrs kelly you cant cut 
back but so far 
but nancy silks owner of three that pet place pet stores in 
state college and johnstown pa said she would have to close her 
downtown state college store and reduce her staff at the nittanny 
mall if the raise went into effect 
as canaries chirped away at her mall store ms silks told a 
reporter ends are hard enough to meet as it is for a small 
business anyhow

the senate approved legislation to end 35 years 
of federal price controls on natural gas with critics predicting 
that decontrol would set the stage for a damaging round of price 
increases in the early 1990s 
the 8217 vote in the senate on wednesday followed house approval 
in april of a similar bill reltively minor differences between the 
two are expected to be worked out fairly quickly to allow president 
bush to sign a bill into law this summer 
bush has made natural gas decontrol one of his top energy policy 
priorities 
supporters of decontrol say it will help the energy industry by 
spurring more drilling activity consumers will benefit because 
supplies will increase they say 
but opponents led on capitol hill by sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio contend the legislation will lay a foundation for price 
increases in a few years that would mean financial hardship for some 
of the 48 million households heated by natural gas 
the gas producers want to ride that rocket as far as it will 
take them metzenbaum said in a floor speech before the vote 
the consumers of this country are going to be hurt 
ed rothschild assistant director of the citizenlabor energy 
coalition said the legislation was a cavein to the financial 
interests of the gas industry 
the vote of a majority of the senate gives gas producers 
everything theyve ever wanted and is making consumers pay for it 
he said adding that within two years natural gas prices probably 
would be about 15 percent higher than today 
about twothirds of us natural gas was decontrolled by the 1978 
natural gas policy act of the remaining gas that still is 
controlled most is selling in the open market at prices below the 
federal ceilings so enactment of the decontrol legislation is not 
expected to have much immediate effect on consumer prices 
but many industry analysts believe prices will start rising 
significantly in the early 1990s as a supply glut that has persisted 
for much of this decade disappears 
sen bennett johnston dla chief sponsor of the bill said 
consumers have nothing to fear from removal of the remaining 
controls since deregulation would fix dislocations in the 
marketplace that serve to limit natural gas exploration 
therell be more drilling more jobs will be produced in the 
natural gas industry he said stressing that gasproducing states 
such as his own would be major beneficiaries of a freer market 
the gas industry which lobbied hard for the legislation cheered 
the senate vote 
the senates passage of natural gas decontrol legislation is a 
wonderful day for producers and consumers said nicholas j bush 
president of the natural gas supply association the producers main 
trade group he expressed confidence that the house and senate 
versions could be reconciled and sent to the president 
the only significant difference between the bills is that the 
house version provides for immediate decontrol of all gas produced

new drought legislation in the house includes 
provisions that agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says could 
raise taxpayer complaints 
in my judgment some of the present drought proposals are at 
best on the margin of acceptability to the american public 
yeutter said wednesday 
the senate agriculture committee meanwhile unanimously approved 
a rural development program and agreed to take up drought relief on 
july 19 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas had argued before the 
committee on tuesday that quick action on drought relief for winter 
wheat farmers should come before rural development legislation 
large areas of the great plains and western corn belt have still 
not recovered from the devastating 1988 drought the winter wheat 
crop in kansas for example is down by more than a third from last 
year 
yeutter in an interview with reporters said that we have not 
officially embraced any drought legislation and will give an 
official response when the time comes 
yeutter said he preferred doles droughtrelief bill over a 
broader version in the house which he described as too 
openended with far too much taxpayer exposure and vulnerability 
further he said the house bill is far too subject to attack 
by the general public because of its costs and other features 
yeutter said the dole bill is far more acceptable in that regard 
doles drought bill would extend terms of last years drought 
relief to crops planted in 1988 for harvest in 1989 mostly winter 
wheat which is normally kansas biggest crop 
the house bill which was approved by the agriculture committee 
on may 25 is basically an extension of the 39 billion 1988 
drought relief law under it if farmers qualified they could get 
federal aid for any affected crop or livestock operation 
rep kika de la garza dtexas chairman of the house committee 
said the bill provides the thinnest of safety nets for farmers 
around the country who have suffered significant financial losses 
because of the continuing drought and other types of weather 
damage 
de la garza said the committee acted in a compassionate and 
budgetarily sound manner to deal with the tragedy of these farmers 
but yeutter said there are limits on measures the federal 
government can or should take to remove risk from the nations 
agriculture 
we are already covering price risk in agriculture in a very 
significant way through a variety of programs he said we are 
already covering income risks to agriculture in a very significant 
way through a variety of programs including deficiency payments 
subsidies 
yeutter added if were now also to cover weather risks in a 
very significant way one must wonder just what additional role 
government should take up on behalf of american agriculture and at 
what cost 
already he said there are multibilliondollar price tags 
for the price support and income protection under federal crop 
programs 
it seems to me at some point in time as an industry were 
likely to experience a taxpayer rebellion and we ought to be 
careful to ensure that we can persuasively defend these programs to 
the american public yeutter said 
the dole drought bill is obviously more attractive than the 
house bill because it is limited mostly to winter wheat he said 
that at least limits the cost exposure to the american 
taxpayer and confines it to a segment of our economy that has really 
been damaged

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says that 
if congress goes along with president bushs clean air plan corn 
farmers may see a growing market in the fuel industry in the decade 
ahead 
its too early to make predictions he said but bushs call for 
more cars to use neat fuels that dont pollute should be 
perceived as potentially good news for farmers 
yeutter said the bush proposal calls for manufacturers to turn 
out 500000 cars a year by 1995 and 1 million a year by 1997 that 
are equipped to use alternative fuels 
during his visit this week to the university of nebraska bush 
participated in a demonstration of an automobile using ethanolbased 
fuel and witnessed another using a combination of ethanol and etbe 
ethyl tertiarybutyl ether a promising alternativeto gasoline 
ethanol a fuelgrade alcohol currently processed in the united 
states mostly from corn has held high hopes for many farmers and 
energy companies for years its production has been heavily 
subsidized to make it competitive 
yeutter told reporters wednesday that etbe has an ethanol base at 
the moment but also could be based on methanol a rival fuel made 
from coal natural gas and plants 
a lot can happen in the next six or seven years he said 
we really dont know what might be the fuels of choice at that 
time 
yeutter said that during talks within the administration on 
reform of the 1970 clean air act he cautioned against announcing a 
specific fuel for the 1995 project and beyond 
technology that exists today for ethanol or methanol or any 
other neat fuel could change dramatically he said 
also yeutter said the current technology and methods of 
providing ethanol from corn could not compete with gasoline without 
federal subsidies 
whether or not that will be the case by 1995 remains to be 
seen he said

james b busey is headed towards quick senate 
approval as head of the federal aviation administration according 
to senators who ushered the fourstar admiral through a congenial 
confirmation hearing 
they also told busey on wednesday that he could keep his status 
as a retired military officer and collect his full pension even 
though the law says the faa administrator must be a civilian 
both buseys confirmation and a bill that would provide an 
exemption to allow him to collect the pension are likely to pass by 
july 1 predicted sen wendell ford dky chairman of the senate 
commerce science and transportation committee 
busey told the committee on wednesday that his priorities for 
aviation would be safety security and modernization of the civil 
aviation system and pledged to keep a strong work force to monitor 
the skies he also pledged to listen to the advice of aviation 
interest groups and others 
i dont have any plans to do anything different from what is 
done right now busey said when asked by sen john kerry dmass 
if he would take additional steps to guarantee the safety of 
financially troubled carriers such as eastern airlines 
but busey who is retiring as commander of us naval forces in 
europe pledged that any indication that safety procedures were 
not being followed would trigger us into immediate action 
the former jet fighter pilot gave similar noncontroversial 
responses throughout 90 minutes of questioning from a handful of 
senators 
by the end of the hearing only the committee chairman sen 
wendell ford dky was left on the panel and he predicted busey 
would win easy senate approval 
the faa has been without an administrator since allan mcartor 
resigned in february busey apologized for the delay saying the 
time it took to be relieved of his overseas duties does not indicate 
a lack of interest in the job 
both democrats and republicans on the committee expressed support 
for busey no objections were raised to his nomination and no 
senator challenged anything the admiral said before the committee 
busey indicated much of his knowledge of issues affecting the faa 
had come from briefings he has received since being nominated by 
president bush 
he said in written response to earlier questions from the 
committee that he had no new suggestions for using the 6 billion 
airport trust fund no proposals for improvement of faa 
procurements no new initiatives for improving the air traffic 
control system no opinion on anticollision systems or proposals 
for head taxes at airports and was keeping an open mind on the 
need for a national airliner noise policy and on the issue of 
banning smoking on more commercial flights 
asked about proposals to make the faa an independent agency 
separate from the transportation department busey said he has 
agreed to work together with transportation secretary samuel skinner 
i do not come to this position seeking autonomy or 
independence he said in his written answer 
ford who plans to introduce legislation giving the faa autonomy 
asked busey during the hearing to at least remain neutral on the 
bill 
ford also advised busey not to appoint a chief of staff who would 
have authority over career officers in the agency and suggested that 
he look into new faa rules allowing airlines to maintain their 
planes at foreign repair stations 
busey gave no response to the first suggestion addressing the 
second he said he would not approve overseas facilities where the 
faa could not assure their reliability and would revise the rules if 
there is any indication safety might be compromised

uncle sam would receive the lions share of the 
proceeds from the liquidation of the multimillion dollar holdings of 
william herbert and nelson bunker hunt but the former billionaires 
would remain wealthy under their proposed settlement plans 
the sons of wildcatter hl hunt pushed into bankruptcy by 
lawsuits and internal revenue service claims want us bankruptcy 
judge harold abramson to allow creditors to vote on the plan which 
would create liquidation trusts for each brother 
a hearing was scheduled for today in abramsons downtown dallas 
courtroom but he is not expected to rule immediately 
the brothers filed for protection from their creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code last year after a peruvian 
mining company won a 196 million judgment against them for their 
attempt to corner the silver market in 1979 and 1980 
the irs also has multimilliondollar claims against the brothers 
charging taht bunker and his wife caroline owe the government 600 
million while herbert and his wife nancy owe 300 million 
bunker and caroline hunt have said they have about 25883 
million in assets to cover debt of more than 12 billion herbert 
and nancy value their assets at 16938 million and debts of 887 
million 
attorneys for some creditors objected to a similar plan presented 
in april especially objectionable they said were provisions that 
would allow the brothers control over the trusts and leave them with 
millions of dollars in assets 
the real creditors dont want the hunts managing this said 
hugh ray attorney for manufacturers hanover trust co of new york 
which claims the brothers owe the bank 36 million 
the plans filed wednesday contain the most detailed look yet at 
the brothers holdings ranging from bunker hunts 10 silver 
churchill commemorative coin to his 19 million coin collection 
the largest and most valuable privately held collection of ancient 
coins in the world 
besides the coins and another 3 million in vases art 
porcelain statues and jewelry bunker hunts holdings are a maze of 
partial interests in dallasarea real estate oil and gas properties 
worldwide and 736 million in cash 
herbert hunts assets include 395 million worth of producing 
oil and gas leases a 35 million collection of ancient bronze 
statues and artifacts 2 million worth of byzantine coins a home 
worth 125 million and 1 million interest in the dallas bowling 
center 
while the brothers plans differ in detail they both suggest 
creating of a liquidation trust which would sell off their holdings 
over a sixyear period to pay down their debts 
in both plans the irs would get the largest chunk of the 
proceeds 70 percent of bunker hunts 60 percent of herbert hunts 
on wednesday abramson granted the brothers request to dismiss 
from the bankruptcy proceedings 601 claims from people who say they 
lost 877 million because of the brothers attempts to corner the 
silver market 
the ruling did not affect almost 600 claims amounting to about 
360 million stemming from the brothers silver speculation 
included in that is a reduced 1346 million judgment in favor of 
minepaco sa a peruvian mining company 
it was the judgment last year in favor of minepaco that prompted 
the brothers chapter 11 filings

hilton hotels corp in a move that 
could lead to the sale of all or part of the company announced it 
will explore strategies to boost its stock price 
the action had been widely expected since the companys chairman 
barron hilton won voting control of about 25 percent of hilton 
stock five weeks ago he had been embroiled in a long legal battle 
over the estate of his father conrad hilton 
hilton stock jumped 312 a share to close at 9512 on the new 
york stock exchange wednesday the stock has climbed steadily from 
63 a share on may 8 the day the estate dispute was settled 
according to a statement issued wednesday the company will hire 
a financial adviser to help its board evaluate strategies to 
optimize shareholder value 
although several parties have expressed interest in the company 
over the last five weeks there have been no formal offers said 
hilton vice president roy judge he declined to name the prospective 
investors 
an investment adviser would be chosen in a week to 10 days judge 
said 
in addition to selling all or part of the company hilton could 
opt to borrow money to pay stockholders a big dividend another 
option analysts have suggested would be selling the companys hotels 
and keeping its casinos in las vegas 
my guess is theyll wind up selling the whole company because 
tax law favors that alternative said daniel lee an analyst with 
drexel burnham lambert inc in new york barrons made some big 
hints that he was likely to sell the company 
the estate settlement ended a legal battle between barron hilton 
and the conrad n hilton foundation over control of 135 million of 
the companys 487 million stock shares the foundation supports 
travel and drug education and roman catholic nuns around the world 
conrad hilton left the stock to the foundation when he died in 
1979 but his son maintained through a nineyear legal wrangle he 
was entitled to buy it at its 1979 market value 
the settlement provided barron hilton with 41 million shares 
the foundation with 35 million and the rest went into a trust with 
income to be split 6040 between hilton and the foundation for the 
next 20 years barron hilton gets to vote the shares in the trust 
that combined with his other holdings gives him control of about 
25 percent of the company 
hilton owns 11 hotels including the waldorf astoria and the las 
vegas and flamingo hiltons in nevada and manages 13 hotels it owns 
in partnerships with others including the hilton hawaiian village 
in honolulu and hiltons in san francisco chicago new york and 
washington the company manages 21 hotels it doesnt have any 
ownership interest in and franchises 225 hilton inns

lisa hart a single parent getting by as a fastfood worker at an 
oklahoma city hardees said she was looking forward to a good pay 
raise until president bush vetoed the minimum wage bill 
lee soule who owns a mall restaurant in san francisco said he 
too believes the minimum wage should be increased and is sorry the 
president vetoed the bill 
ms hart and soule were among workers and managers queried by the 
associated press on wednesday following bushs veto of a measure to 
gradually raise the current 335 hourly minimum to 455 democrats 
in congress tried to override the veto but fell short of the 
twothirds majority needed to do so 
out in the saloons and restaurants and pet shops where the issue 
has the most impact opinion was mixed but most people on both the 
management and labor side agreed the current minimum is not enough 
people have to understand how treacherous it is to try and live 
on 335 an hour said soule who pays waiters at his midscale 
pacific cafe the california hourly minimum of 425 
in washington the labor department said california is one of 12 
states with minimum wages higher than the federal one the district 
of columbia guam and the virgin islands also have higher minimums 
among these 15 jurisdictions the highest is the district of 
columbia where the minimum varies according to circumstances but 
can be as high as 475 new hampshire and vermont with 365 
minimums are the lowest among the 15 the lowest minimum wage set 
by state law is 150 in ohio but that has long been overridden by 
the federal standard 
ms hart who makes more than the current minimum but less than 
455 was asked if 335 is a livable wage 
no way she said the most you could do is pay your 
utilities or your mortgage 
her manager anita feeley said starting workers at the 
restaurant now get 365 an hour she said she didnt think 
employers would lay off workers if the wage were raised to 455 
but they might become warier about whom they hired 
in seattle shari hudson said the tips she receives at benjamins 
restaurant bring in about three times as much as her wage of 385 
an hour the minimum in washington state the proposed raise she 
said might pay the tax on our tips 
interviews at restaurants in seattle yakima and spokane wash 
plus a dry cleaning shop a pub and a beauty supply store in the 
state turned up no businesses that said they were paying the minimum 
wage 
in maine the story was much the same the state minimum is 375 
an hour but in many areas the starting scale is well above that 
theres just too much competition around here said pamela 
potter staffing coordinator for four mcdonalds restaurants 
in boston also it was hard to find minimum wage workers 
fastfood restaurants are advertising for employees at 6 or 7 an 
hour and dishwashers in chinatown start at 5 according to a 
restaurant owner 
i can see minimum wage for kids in high school but if youre 
living alone theres no way no way you can do it on 335 an 
hour said christopher long a 23yearold bostonian leaning 
against the bumper of his black 1989 jeep with a broad smile and 
rayban sunglasses on his face long said he would not consider a 
job at less than 6 
in ocean city nj roy gillian owner of wonderland pier said 
in the northeast it has no effect because we couldnt get 
anybody for 335 
vera kelly 49 of queens who works behind the lunch counter at 
lamstons a five and dime store in manhattan said even 455 
still wouldnt support a family it should be even more than 
that 
few workers believed employers would be forced to lay off people 
if the minimum were raised 
youve got to have help said mrs kelly you cant cut 
back but so far 
but nancy silks owner of three that pet place pet stores in 
state college and johnstown pa said she would have to close her 
downtown state college store and reduce her staff at the nittanny 
mall if the raise went into effect 
as canaries chirped away at her mall store ms silks told a 
reporter ends are hard enough to meet as it is for a small 
business anyhow

a wildcat coal miners strike that has 
spread across west virginia and virginia comes at a time of soaring 
production dwindling employment and concerns about president bushs 
clean air proposal 
the walkout began monday in support of 1600 united mine workers 
members on strike against the pittston coal group it has spread to 
more than 10000 workers and crippled production in parts of west 
virginia the nations thirdlargest producer and virginia among 
the topproducing states in the east 
the strike is taking place with industry and union officials 
concerned about the potential impact of the presidents clean air 
package announced this week it would require a 50 percent cut in 
sulfur dioxide emissions from coalfired plants by 1990 
the umw says the plan could put 30000 miners out of work 
particularly hardhit would be highsulfur coal mines in illinois 
ohio western pennsylvania and west virginia 
richard l lawson president of the national coal association 
called some of the plans provisions unnecessary unduly harsh and 
economically onerous 
company officials in west virginia and virginia say its too 
early to tell what effect the wildcat strikes will have on business 
but any extended walkout would be a severe blow to the appalachian 
economy by cutting into tax revenues 
it usually takes at least a week or 10 days before you start 
noticing it said williamson mayor sam kapourales whose town is 
in the heart of the southern west virginia coal field i hope its 
not going to be a long or lengthy thing i hope they get it worked 
out because nobody wins under these circumstances 
the walkout hasnt hurt west virginias economy yet but the pain 
threshhold could be near for some areas state energy department 
spokeswoman twila matheny said 
when youre talking about your heavier coal producing counties 
and 90 percent of their mines closed we could be near that now 
she said 
utilities also could be affected if the strike persists 
especially if a hot summer boosts demand for air conditioning 
matheny said american electric power co the nations leading coal 
buyer has a normal stockpile to last 55 to 75 days said chuck 
ebetino managing director of coal procurement for the utilitys 
coalbuying division the utility supplies power to parts of seven 
midwest and appalachian states including west virginia and virginia 
we have had some shipments during the period although they 
have mainly been from mine inventories obviously if it were to 
continue it would affect our storage ebetino said of the strike 
coal production has been climbing despite a decline in jobs in 
recent years companies laid off workers during the recession of the 
early 1980s and competition from lowcost governmentsubsidized 
coal from countries like poland and australia has kept pressure on 
jobs 
because of the introduction of laborsaving technology 1988 coal 
production in west virginia hit a 20year high of 1437 million 
tons while employment slid to 24280 the lowest since the state 
began keeping records in 1900 
nationwide production increased from 776 million tons in 1979 to 
914 million tons in 1987 while mine employment fell from 224000 to 
142000 the federal energy information administration said 
wednesday 
union members at pittston had been working for 14 months without 
a contract before going on strike in april over wages benefits and 
work rules in particular workers are angry that the company 
dropped out of the unions national contract with the bituminous 
coal operators association in an attempt to wring favorable 
workrule changes 
about 650 employees of westmoreland coal co walked out wednesday 
at three mines in wise county va it was the first major expansion 
of the wildcat strike that began monday by about 10000 miners in 
southern west virginia 
us district judge dennis knapp in charleston told wildcatters 
to go back to work at four west virginia companies but strikers 
have ignored knapps previous backtowork orders at other southern 
west virginia companies 
the umw has not sanctioned the wildcat strike which violates a 
nostrike clause in the national bituminous coal operators 
association pact

president bush won his first battle with 
congress over raising the minimum wage but democrats are promising 
to emerge from the next round of the fight with a new measure the 
president will be unable to kill with a veto 
our obligation now is to move forward with a bill which will be 
enacted and put money in the pockets of lowwage workers this 
year house labor committee chairman augustus hawkins said 
wednesday after he and fellow democrats failed to override bushs 
veto of a minimumwage bill 
hawkins dcalif said he was preparing a new bill but wanted to 
talk with administration officials first to see if there was room 
for compromise 
across the capitol sen edward m kennedy dmass wasted no 
time in beginning the second phase of the fight introducing a bill 
identical to the one bush vetoed tuesday 
the president should understand that this is an issue on which 
congress has only begun to fight said kennedy chairman of the 
senate labor committee the issue is fairness and americas 
working poor deserve a fair increase in the minimum wage 
kennedy too said he hoped to strike a compromise with the white 
house and with hawkins invited labor secretary elizabeth dole to 
appear before a joint session of the labor committees next week 
but kennedy served notice he wanted to advance a new bill quickly 
and would do so whether or not bush gives ground 
i would prefer to work out an acceptable compromise with the 
administration kennedy said but if that is not possible we 
will try to enact a measure that has the support of a vetoproof 
majority 
initial white house reaction indicated that bush was not about to 
budge 
the congress should enact the presidents minimum wage proposal 
at the earliest opportunity said bush spokesman marlin fitzwater 
mrs dole said that if congress is unwilling to accept bushs 
minimum wage proposal it should drop the issue and instead focus on 
job training vocational education and other efforts to help the 
working poor 
i hope that now we can move on to the issues that will really 
make a difference in peoples lives mrs dole said 
bushs offer is to increase the hourly minimum wage from 335 to 
425 by january 1992 with employers being able to pay all new 
hires a subminimum wage for six months 
the legislation he vetoed tuesday would have increased the floor 
wage to 455 by october 1991 and contained a restrictive clause 
allowing employers to pay a subminimum to some new workers for no 
more than two months 
the house under new speaker thomas s foley tried to override 
the veto just 24 hours after it was issued but the effort fell 
short by more than 30 votes the vote was 247178 with 20 
republicans joining 227 democrats in trying to override the veto 
twentyeight democrats joined 150 republicans in thwarting the 
leadership from reaching the twothirds margin it needed to override 
a coalition of house republicans also entered the second round of 
the fight introducing a new minimumwage proposal of their own that 
also includes a modest expansion of the earned income tax credit 
available to families with young children 
the new gop measure would be closely studied by democrats looking 
to draft a new bill that will attract enough support to override 
bush in the event of a second veto 
while he introduced a measure identical to the one vetoed 
kennedy said he considered it only a start and would consider 
amendments in the house hawkins was considering a proposal calling 
for an increase in the minimum wage to 425 an hour within two 
years 
that level matches bushs final target for the minimum wage but 
would bring it there a year earlier than bush favors but hawkins 
said he was not prepared to meet bushs demand for the sixmonth 
subminimum a provision the president has said must be in any 
minimumwage legislation for him to sign it 
the new republican proposal matches bushs threeyear formula for 
bringing the minimum wage to 425 an hour but it takes the middle 
ground in the fight over the subminimum allowing it to be paid for 
four months twice what democrats say they will allow and two 
months short of bushs demand

hartnett agreed with tysons argument that holly managers favored 
conagra in an auction for the company but he said behindthescenes 
dealing between tyson and conagra justified such actions 
it is the interest of the holly farms shareholders which must 
be primarily considered hartnett said 
hartnett was told at a hearing earlier this month that tyson 
agreed to pay conagra 50 million to get out of the bidding for 
holly farms but the deal fell through 
in ruling to leave holly farms poison pill intact hartnett 
said there was no assurance holly and conagra shareholders would 
uphold the latest merger proposal and he said tyson might be able to 
buy enough holly stock to block it 
shareholders are expected to vote on conagras proposed merger 
with holly farms next month

time inc stock continued to fluctuate in the 
absence of any word from the media giant on how it will fight 
paramount communications corps unwanted 107 billion takeover bid 
time stock which rose 5 on tuesday on speculation about a 
higher bid from general electric co fell 487 to 17512 a 
share in new york stock exchange composite trading wednesday 
meanwhile paramount rose 175 to 5950 a share and warner 
communications inc which still hopes to preserve its own pending 
merger agreement with time was up 75 cents to 55 a share 
traders apparently speculated that paramount might itself receive 
a takeover bid and werent discounting the possibility another 
suitor might make an offer for time higher than paramounts 
175ashare bid said j kendrick noble an analyst with 
painewebber inc 
time gave no hint as to its plans leaving investors to buy on 
speculation alone 
the board was expected to meet sometime this week to discuss the 
media giants strategy but spokesman edward adler refused to 
comment on whether the board met wednesday 
even if no formal meeting was scheduled it was likely the 
directors were in contact about the situation 
among the options the time board was believed to be considering 
were a recapitalization of the company a cash tender offer for 
warner a cash tender offer for paramount or a continued pursuit of 
its planned merger with warner warner also could launch a cash 
tender offer for time 
i really feel the picture is unpredictable at this point 
noble said but he added i think the original merger as proposed 
is probably dead 
the timewarner merger likely would have to be renegotiated 
because of the surge in times stock price since the paramount bid 
was announced last week time shares were trading at 126 before 
paramount announced its offer and the timewarner agreement was 
based on the lower stock price 
under the planned merger time stockholders would get a share in 
the new company for each share they own while warner shareholders 
would get 0465 of a share of the new company for each of their 
warner shares 
on tuesday time in one of the few public moves the company has 
made since the paramount bid was announced last week asked the 
federal communications commission to deny a paramount request to 
create a voting trust for time stock 
the trust would allow paramount to purchase times shares pending 
fcc approval of the transfer of cable television franchises and 
licenses held by times 82percentowned cable tv unit american 
television and communications corp

arizonas second largest savings and loan and 
another thrift were declared insolvent and have been taken over by 
federal regulators in a move that reflects the areas weakening real 
estate markets 
the federal home loan bank board placed western savings and loan 
and sun state savings and loan into receivership of the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp 
the fslic in turn named the federal deposit insurance corp as 
managing agent of each thrift officials announced wednesday 
fdic officials said the thrifts will maintain normal operations 
as federal mutual savings and loans all depositors will continue to 
be protected up to the 100000 insured limit 
however the fdic said the receiverships relieve both western and 
sun state of their stock and subordinated debt obligations the 
two new institutions also did not assume any obligations to the 
stockholders of the insolvent thrifts the agency said 
you invest your savings and in a day they take it away its 
rough said a western investor who attended the news conference 
and who declined to be identified 
fdic spokesman alan j whitney blamed the phoenix areas 
depressed real estate economy for much of the troubles of arizona 
financial institutions he said 35 percent of arizonas banks lost 
money last year the highest percentage in the nation 
acting state banking superintendent william h rivoir iii said 
western and sun state were taken into receivership to conserve 
remaining assests 
its certainly no coincidence that approximately 9 million of 
the institution western would have been paid to the bondholders 
tommorrow rivoir said when asked about the timing of the seizure 
western which is arizonas second largest thrift had been 
scheduled to decide today whether it would make a 9 million payment 
on 155 million worth of subordinated notes 
on april 30 western had 578 billion in assets and 599 
billion in liabilities and on may 31 was 858 million below the 
required capital level the fdic said sun state on april 30 had 
106 billion in assets and 109 billion in liabilities and on may 
31 was 272 million below the required capital level the agency 
said 
virginia judues named the fdics managing agent for western 
said while she would consult with western chairman robert stallings 
the financial decisions would be made by the government 
ms judues said the fdic is in the process of setting up an 
advisory board to manage the thrift western will limit its 
realestate lending to financing singlefamily residences 
herbert chin who like ms judues is a senior liquidation 
specialist with the fdic in san francisco was named sun states 
managing agent 
both thrifts recently were placed under new management after 
regulators forced the ouster of previous executives

mcorp lost nearly 1 billion last year but the 
five banks that it retains narrowed their loss to 134 million in 
the first quarter according to the bank holding company 
federal regulators seized 20 of the companys 25 subsidiary banks 
in march pushing it into protection from creditors under chapter 11 
of the bankruptcy code the five remaining banks are profitable and 
solvent although some do not meet federal capital requirements 
mcorps loss last year totaled 9779 million a figure that was 
held down by a 2155 million gain from the sale of dallasbased 
mcorps 80 percent interest in mtech a dataprocessing company in 
the second quarter last year 
mcorp said it lost control of the 20 banks last oct 1 and 
writeoffs in connection with their closing account for a large 
portion of the losses 
mcorp said in a news conference wednesday it is confident it can 
emerge from chapter 11 as a profitable company 
joe stroop a spokesman said the banks 134 million loss in 
the first quarter does not reflect mcorps fully earning potential 
the firstquarter bank figures obtained from federal deposit 
insurance corp reports also do not include performance of other 
holding company subsidiaries including a trust bank that probably 
earned a profit said frank anderson bank analyst with stephens 
inc in little rock ark 
the financial services companys 1988 loss was nearly four times 
the 258 million shortfall for the previous year

the us merchandise trade deficit dipped 
sharply to 826 billion in april as exports rose to a new high and 
imports declined the government said today 
the commerce department said the secnd straight monthly 
improvement in the countrys trade balance came from a 08 percent 
increase in exports and a 26 percent decline in imports 
the april deficit was 134 percent below a revised march 
imbalance of 954 billion marchs trade gap originally had been 
estimated at 886 billion 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration 
was very pleased by the continuing decline in trade figures 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher also hailed the numbers but 
cautioned it is always unwise to put too much weight on any one 
or two months figures in these volatile statistics 
the recent strength of the dollar leads us to be concerned 
about the economys ability to sustain the excellent trends seen so 
far mosbacher said 
aprils trade gap was the lowest since last july when the 
deficit hit 802 billion the report was even better than the 85 
billion gap that many analysts had been expecting for the month 
the trade deficit so far this year has been showing improvement 
over its 1988 track record analysts are divided however over how 
long the nation can expect the good news to continue as oil prices 
rise and the stronger value of the dollar makes american products 
more expensive on overseas markets 
for the first four months of 1989 the trade deficit ran at an 
annual rate of 1089 billion a marked improvement from last years 
actual deficit of 11976 billion 
the april improvement came even though the bill for foreign oil 
jumped 99 percent to 405 billion 
the average price of a barrel of oil shot up 116 percent to 
1783 in april the fifth straight monthly increase the volume of 
imported oil meanwhile rose to 757 million barrels a day from 
745 million in march 
overall imports fell to a seasonally adjusted 3884 billion 
the lower figure included declines in sales of foreign cars 
manufactured capital goods and agricultural products 
us exports meanwhile hit a record 3057 billion in april 
exports of industrial supplies manufactured capital goods and 
consumer goods all increased 
economist joe carson of chemical bank in new york said he expects 
continued progress on the trade front despite recent strengthening 
of the dollar against foreign currencies 
i dont think the recent rise in the dollar will break the 
favorable trend thats been in place for the past two years 
carson said in advance of todays report the most recent trade 
figures have been very encouraging were still experiencing very 
strong export growth and import growth is slowing 
nevertheless many analysts remain concerned that the imbalance 
between imports and exports will begin growing again this year under 
the adverse influence of higher oil prices and slower demand for 
us exports 
economist howard roth of security pacific national bank in los 
angeles said that as the strength of dollar takes hold it could 
negatively affect the trade deficit on both the import and export 
fronts as americans start buying more imports and foreigners find 
our goods more expensive 
roth anticipating todays favorable report said april may be 
the last hurrah it might be getting worse from now on 
as usual the united states posted its largest trade deficit in 
april with japan but the 389 billion gap was down sharply from 
422 billion in march 
the nation posted its second straight trade surplus with western 
europe in april registered a 232 million surplus on top of 397 
million in march 
the imbalance with canada the largest us trading partner rose 
to 477 million in april other large deficits were recorded with 
taiwan 840 million south korea 545 million and brazil 365 
million 
robert dederick chief economist for northern trust co in 
chicago said recent improvement in the trade deficit probably was 
attributable to shortterm factors that do not point toward 
longterm progress 
he said the improvement in the trade deficit in recent years was 
largely the result of a weakening dollar 
we think that the cessation of the weakening dollar at the 
end of 1987 ought to begin to show up more prominently dederick 
said we dont think were going to get improvement to continue on 
the order of the past two years 
the bush administration meanwhile is counting on continued 
progress on narrowing the trade gap to spur economic growth this 
year last years dramatic 21 percent drop in the trade deficit from 
an alltime high of 1521 billion in 1987 accounted for nearly half 
of all us economic growth 
on tuesday the government reported that a broader measure of 
us trade worsened dramatically during the first three months of 
the year the commerce department said the deficit in the current 
account was 7 percent larger than in the final three months of 1988 
that deficit figure reflected improvement in merchandise trade but 
a widening of the deficit in the services category

the securities and exchange commission has 
barred a cincinnati stockbroker from the securities business but 
said he could be reinstated if he gets a clean bill of health from a 
psychiatrist 
the broker p david herrlinger caused an uproar on wall street 
on june 23 1987 when he called dow jones news service and announced 
a bogus 68 billion offer to buy minneapolisbased dayton hudson 
corp one of the nations biggest retailers 
speculators responding to the dow jones report of the purported 
70 a share bid sent the price of dayton hudson stock soaring by as 
much as 9 a share in heavy trading the price later tumbled after 
herrlingers attorney reported the offer was a hoax 
herrlinger was fired by capital management corp an investment 
counseling firm the same day and subsequently hospitalized he was 
diagnosed as suffering from manic depression 
the sec sued herrlinger in july 1987 for securities law 
violations and alleged he profited by trading dayton hudson stock 
options through his brother a stockbroker in albuquerque nm 
before and after making the bogus bid 
herrlinger also has been sued by several investors who claim they 
lost money due to the false offer 
herrlingers lawyer anthony covatta said thursday that the sec 
seemed to understand that on the day of the big event mr 
herrlinger wasnt himself 
he didnt get off totally unsullied by the sec but certainly 
the sanctions are less than they could have been covatta said 
herrlinger will be allowed to reapply for admission to the 
securities industry in one year but must first obtain a 
psychiatrists certification that he is mentally stable according 
to the settlement agreement handed down wednesday

the supreme court today resolved a tax dispute 
between the insurance industry and the internal revenue service in a 
decision dealing a significant financial setback to many insurance 
companies 
the justices by a 63 vote ruled that the ceding 
commissions a life insurance company pays when reinsuring another 
firms policies may not be claimed as deductions for the year they 
are paid 
instead the court ruled that any tax deductions for those 
commission payments must be spread out over the anticipated life of 
the policy 
we have concluded that ceding commissions are costs incurred to 
acquire an asset with an incomeproducing life that may extend 
substantially beyond one year justice anthony m kennedy wrote 
for the court 
general tax principles provide that such costs must be 
amortized and capitalized over the useful life of the asset he 
said 
the irs refused to let colonial american life insurance co a 
louisianabased corporation claim some 15 million in such 
deductions for 1975 and 1976 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the tax agencys 
refusal but other federal appeals courts had allowed such 
deductions 
colonial american in 1975 and 1976 agreed to partially indemnify 
transport life insurance co policies in return colonial american 
became entitled to the same percentage of future premiums received 
on the policies 
the agreement required colonial american to pay transport ceding 
commissions in consideration for the business acquired the 
commissions totaled 680000 in 1975 and 852000 in 1976 
colonial american then sought to deduct as business losses the 
full amount of the commissions in the years they were paid 
the court calling the commission payments investments in the 
future today said the irs correctly disallowed the immediate 
lumpsum deductions 
justices john paul stevens harry a blackmun and sandra day 
oconnor dissented 
the case is colonial american life vs commissioner internal

the national association of securities 
dealers has penalized managers at the investment firm buchanan amp co 
for wrongdoing in the underwriting and sale of 250 million in 
taxfree bonds that later defaulted 
robert m buchanan jr owner and chairman of the defunct 
jacksonbased company was fined 200000 censured suspended from 
the nasd for two years and banned from control of any nasdmember 
company 
the penalties were imposed after company officials consented to 
findings that they engaged in deceptive dishonest or unfair 
practices in the underwriting and sale of bonds the nasd said in 
a news release wednesday 
nasd spokesman enno hobbing said the officials consent statement 
neither admitted nor denied guilt and was similar to a 
nocontest plea 
company officials had insisted that they were innocent of any 
wrongdoing 
buchanans business plummeted after reports in 1987 that 
thousands of investors had been left holding worthless paper from 
bonds mostly for nursing homes and retirement centers that were 
underwritten by the company 
the company which in its heyday had 150 employees in six states 
and annual sales approaching 300 million filed for 
bankruptcycourt protection last december and has been sued by 
numerous investors in several states 
besides buchanan the nasd imposed penalties on the companys 
president robert c fairly who was censured fined 20000 
suspended from the nasd for a year and prohibited from being a 
principal in an nasd company for five years 
lesser penalties were imposed on branch managers jonathan d 
ulrich russell w clark murl d calton jeffrey d rhodes kenneth 
c weber and mary s nelson and on salesmen kenneth e crowl 
randall j white lorin w surpless gerard p musto and william b 
nelson 
the nasd said buchanan and fairly were responsible for 
misrepresenting and omitting facts in the sale of 10 municipal bond 
issues worth 7447 million 
the nasd also found that the firm acting through buchanan and 
fairly orchestrated a highpressure misleading retail sales 
campaign for these bonds as well as for other highyield nonrated 
bonds 
many of the bonds were sold to fixedincome investors at free 
seminars in retirement areas such as tucson ariz and tampa fla 
a colleague of buchanans at another investment office where he 
is currently working said he was out of town and unavailable for 
comment today fairlys daughter also said he was unavailable for 
comment today

the recent decline in interest rates has stirred 
up new enthusiasm for mutual funds that invest in bonds 
when rates decline as they have since early spring this year 
prices of existing bonds naturally tend to rise that gives owners 
of bondfund shares a shot at capital gains from the funds rising 
net asset values on top of the interest they earn 
for all but the wealthiest individual investors financial 
advisers widely recommend picking a mutual fund or other packaged 
vehicle rather than shopping for individual bonds 
we think smart investors should avoid individual issues 
analysts at the value line investment survey say in a recent 
commentary 
for one thing value line says funds provide a diversified 
portfolio for even the smallest investments diversification reduces 
credit risk the potential losses you might suffer should an 
individual bond issuer default 
diversification is especially important with long bonds even 
governments which have no credit risk because the manager has the 
ability to select the mix of maturities and coupon rates he or she 
considers the most desirable value line observes 
a longterm bond fund reduces transaction costs especially if 
the investor has limited his consideration to funds with no 
frontend load redemption or other charges 
the major advantage the fund offers an individual in addition 
to professional management is its buying power one million dollars 
is the typical trading unit 
because the fund managers are in the marketplace every day 
dealing in large amounts with many brokers they usually can obtain 
advantageous prices on both sales and purchases 
the individual owner of say 10000 worth of bonds will 
probably not do nearly as well 
another advantage funds offer is automatic reinvestment in new 
fund shares of dividends and any capital gains distributions that 
shareholders decide not to receive as cash payouts 
investors pay a price for these benefits of course even in 
funds which impose no sales or redemption charges operating 
expenses and management fees are collected from the assets of a 
fund thus effectively lowering the yield that flows through to 
shareholders 
another characteristic of bond funds that some people find 
troublesome is their lack of a stated maturity date because fund 
portfolios are continuously managed their life span is indefinite 
so you cannot tell in advance what the dollar value of your 
investment will be when you cash it in whether you do that six 
months or 30 years from now 
an alternative to bond funds is a unit trust a package of 
securities assembled by a brokerage firm and resold to investors in 
small pieces with a predetermined maturity date 
when buying a unit trust you know what securities are 
contained in it now and when it matures says george bernard 
senior vice presidentunit trusts at the investment firm of gruntal 
amp co 
in the case of a bond unit trust youll know what it will be 
worth at maturity 
unlike noload mutual funds unit trusts typically are offered 
with an upfront sales charge if you hold them for a long period 
however this cost may be offset by the lower operating expenses and 
fees that come with the trusts fixed portfolios 
a big selling point with mutual funds is the ease of getting your 
money in and out of them on short notice whenever you wish 
most sponsors of unit trusts also state their willingness to cash 
in some or all of your investment before maturity in that 
situation the price you get for your units as with mutual fund 
shares will be subject to the ups and downs of the credit markets

a federal judge has denied a request for a new 
trial by a former drexel burnham lambert inc assistant trader 
convicted of perjury 
us district judge leonard b sand on wednesday ruled that the 
lawyer for lisa jones 26 was too late in filing a request that the 
judge declare a mistrial and order a new trial 
sand said the request had to be filed within seven days of the 
verdict jones was convicted march 22 of five counts of perjury and 
two of obstruction of justice for lying to a federal grand jury 
investigating insider trading involving drexel 
jones attorney daniel bookin said in court last month that the 
deadline for filing the mistrial motion had passed when he was hired 
in midapril to represent her 
the request for a retrial was based in part on an allegation that 
bookins predecessor who also represented other drexel employees 
had a conflict of interest in representing jones 
but sand ruled he had found no reason to believe that jones had 
been denied a fair trial 
what was truly damaging to ms jones was her apparent inability 
to tell the truth while sitting on the witness stand at trial the 
judge said 
jones faces a total of 35 years in jail and up to 175 million 
in fines sentencing is scheduled for june 28

the house today defeated an attempt to blunt 
the key reform in savings and loan bailout legislation after 
president bush threatened to veto a watereddown bill 
the vote was 32694 with 114 republicans and 212 democrats 
supporting the president fiftysix republicans and 38 democrats 
opted to support the sampl industry on the heavily lobbied issue of 
capital 
bush is insisting that the government force sampls to back their 
lending with more of their own capital 
rep henry j hyde rill tried unsuccessfully to provide an 
exemption for sampls that previously received an accounting break 
known as supervisory good will in exchange for taking ailing 
institutions off the governments hands in the early 1980s 
the accounting break allows some of the acquiring sampls to operate 
without risking any of their owners money hydes amendment would 
have permitted 241 sampls that would fail tougher capital standards to 
appeal administratively for an exemption 
no result is mandated in the hearings hyde said just a 
chance to make your case before the scarlet letter is painted on 
your forehead 
however critics complained the procedure would burden regulators 
and effectively delay bushs key reform by 18 months for a 
significant portion of the industry 
make no mistake about it this amendment guts the bill 
what this amendment does is allow those very weak institutions to 
delay and delay and delay the day of reckoning and while they delay 
and delay and delay the taxpayers will pay and pay and pay said 
rep charles schumer dny a member of the house banking 
committee 
bush in a letter to house republican leader bob michel of 
illinois made it clear he would veto the sampl bill if it included 
hydes proposal 
giving recognition to good will as capital or creating 
procedural changes that could have the same effect is not 
justifiable the president wrote each of the amendments to the 
tough capital standards would render this bill unacceptable to 
me 
it was the first time that bush made the veto threat although 
his advisers have said previously they would recommend that action 
if congress watered down the presidents capital reforms 
there should be no mistake this matter goes to the very heart 
of my determination to clean up the abuses of the past among the 
savings and loans about which every voter is entitled to be 
outraged bush wrote 
meanwhile house speaker thomas s foley dwash said he would 
keep the house in session late tonight and that he was determined to 
pass the bill by friday 
foley predicted the house also would pass an amendment forcing 
the administration to count 44 billion in sampl bailout spending as 
part of the budget deficit setting up a conflict with the senate 
however budget director richard darman told reporters today 
it may be that its an utterly academic question sen phil 
gramm rtexas has collected signatures from 41 republican senators 
pledging to support bushs funding plan 
that effectively scuttles democratic attempts in the house to 
alter it because any change must be approved by 60 out of 100 
senators 
the president met with congressional leaders on wednesday for 
the first time lobbying in person to perserve his capital reforms 
thumping the table in the cabinet room he said every american 
citizen has every right in the world to be disturbed and shocked by 
this situation 
bushs bill the largest government bailout in history would 
spend 285 billion over 30 years 157 billion from taxpayers to 
protect sampl depositors according to the congressional general 
accounting office it also proposes a series of changes designed to 
prevent the most serious financial crisis since the depression from 
recurring 
in addition to requiring sampls to risk more capital the bill 
reorganizes the regulatory bureaucracy to give the administration 
greater control over sampls and it provides money to the justice 
department to prosecute fraud at thrift institutions 
the senate passed its own version of the bill in april and 
congressional aides expect a conference committee to take at least 
until midjuly to resolve differences between the two chambers 
on wednesday the house voted 33095 to adopt procedures limiting 
debate on the bill to 15 amendments including measures that would 
forbid sampls from investing in junk bonds 
strengthen the law prohibiting banks and sampls from 
discriminating against poor and minority neighborhoods 
delete a provision requiring the industryowned federal home 
loan banks to subsidize housing for poor people 
a few members objected to the decision by the 
democraticcontrolled rules committee to prohibit a vote on an 
amendment offered by rep jim leach riowa who wants to delete 
provisions granting special exemptions to individual institutions 
and companies 
theres pork in there warned rep robert walker rpa 
ticking off a list of companies that succeeded in winning 
concessions including such wellknown names as sears roebuck amp 
co merrill lynch and chemical bank 
this is wrong agreed rep tim valentine dnc this is 
the congress of the united states at its worst

chinese governmental action to control 
television coverage of citizen protests in china was raised thursday 
as a reason to limit foreign ownership of cable companies in the 
united states 
i am not troubled to know that here in our nations capital 
the chinese government could continue its control of a fashionable 
restaurant andrew jay schwartzman executive director of media 
access project told a house subcommittee i would be troubled if 
that regime or persons subject to its domination owned and 
operated channel 4 or dc cable 
his opinion was echoed by witnesses supporting legislation 
sponsored by rep edward markey dmass that would limit foreign 
ownership of cable companies in this country to 20 percent 
such restrictions already exist in other facets of the industry 
such as broadcast stations and common carrier properties 
markey said his bill would close a loophole opened when cable 
television grew into the method by which 80 percent of american 
homes receive tv programs 
this is not a question of protectionism but of national 
interest and national security he said 
the recent chinese experience most clearly illustrates the 
power television has in informing and educating a nation and the 
important role of the electronic media serve in facilitating the 
free flow of information he said 
those opposed to the bill said it was unnecessary and would not 
only hurt foreign cable companies already operating here but also 
encourage retaliation against us business abroad 
former federal communications commissioner robert e lee said 
there was ample authority in federal law to seize property of aliens 
in time of war 
also consider the two biggest issues facing our economy today 
the twin deficits of budget and trade he said the complicated 
trade deficit appears to have shown some slight improvement recently 
but every foreign investment that is made in this country helps to 
ease that problem 
in opposition to the bill a letter from former secretary of 
commerce elliot richardson who now heads the association for 
foreign investment in america was submitted to the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on telecommunications and finance which held 
the hearings 
sectoral restrictions on foreign investment not only undermine 
the traditional us policy to reduce barriers to international 
investment but also encourage retaliation against united states 
business abroad he said 
markey who introduced the bill wednesday said additional views 
would be gathered before action is taken on the measure 
my view is that we can construct something that makes some 
sense he said

the head of the environmental protection agency 
predicted on thursday that a long expensive effort will be needed 
to clean the nations toxic waste dumps and he suggested the public 
may have expected too much of the cleanup drive begun nine years ago 
theres no magic wand that i can wave to make this problem go 
away epa administrator william reilly told a senate subcommittee 
meanwhile the supreme court ruled 54 that states may be 
required through private lawsuits to help pay for cleaning up 
hazardous waste sites targeted under the superfund law 
the justices decided that the constitution gives congress the 
power to strip state governments of their immunity from private 
lawsuits the decision will force pennsylvania to defend itself 
against a suit by union gas co aimed at recovering cleanup costs 
the company owes the federal government 
in his testimony to a senate panel dealing with superfund 
matters reilly outlined an internal epa report that suggested 
cleaning up the nearly 1200 toxic sites on the current cleanup 
schedule will cost at least 30 billion and not be completed until 
into the next century by then another 1000 sites are expected to 
be singled out for decontamination possibly costing just as much 
according to epa estimates 
reilly listed changes he plans for his agencys toxic cleanup 
program including giving more emphasis on increased enforcement to 
force polluters and not the government to clean the waste dumps 
reilly noted that congress so far has provided nearly 10 billion 
for the superfund program but that cleanup has been completed in 
only a handful of sites 
in separate testimony the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress said the latest epa figues show that 
of the nearly 1200 toxic dumps on the decontamination list actual 
cleanup has been completed on only 41 sites and begun on another 204 
reilly said that because of money and manpower shortages often 
a choice must be made between either complete cleanup at some 
sites or incremental cleanup at many sites 
even if more funds were available epa lacks sufficient 
expert staff and the nation doesnt have enough qualified engineers 
to take on a fullscale effort at all sites simultaneously reilly 
continued 
sen frank lautenberg dnj subcommittee chairman lauded 
reilly for some of the changes he envisions in the superfund 
program including focusing more on taking polluters to court to 
force them to clean up contaminated sites 
as part of new emphasis on enforcement against polluters the epa 
will shift 75 million from accounts used to hire outside cleanup 
contractors and use it to hire 500 additional lawyers and cleanup 
site supervisers 
the epa chief promised the agency would use all the enforcement 
tools at its disposal in the enforcement actions including the 
threat of seeking treble civil damages from polluters the clear 
threat of legal action will create a better environment for 
settlement he said 
at the supreme court justice william j brennan writing the 
courts main opinion said the superfund law renders states liable 
in money damages in federal court and added that congress has 
the authority to render them so liable when legislating pursuant to 
the constitutions commerce clause 
he was joined fully by justices thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens and in part by justice byron r 
white 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia 
sandra day oconnor and anthony m kennedy voted to dismiss the suit 
against pennsylvania they said the states immunity should prevail

us and japanese officials disagreed thursday on 
whether their talks on elimination of japanese market barriers this 
week fell under the super 301 clause of the 1988 trade act 
japanese officials said they repeated to their american 
counterparts their refusal to negotiate under the clause which 
provides for penalties for nations that do not agree to open their 
markets within 18 months 
the highlevel trade talks which ended wednesday were the first 
since japan was named a priority nation last month under the 
trade act because of its alleged restrictions on us satellites 
supercomputers and forestry products 
us and japanese officials said they had agreed in the talks to 
focus in the future on eliminating structural barriers such as 
japans complex distribution system and the united states low 
savings rate that thwarted attempts to reduce the huge bilateral 
trade imbalance 
we have a large trade deficit with japan that has not responded 
to the dollaryen changes in ways that we thought were 
appropriate said undersecretary of state richard mccormack who 
led the us delegation 
it is very important that we seek ways to increase american 
exports to this country and deal with some of the structural 
impediments that we feel are hindering those exports 
trade friction between the two nations flared last month after 
the united states charged japan with unfair trading practices but 
officials from both sides in separate briefings for reporters 
thursday said this weeks talks emphasized cooperation 
we will not go into negotiations with the understanding there 
will be retaliation if no successful resolution can be found said 
mitoji yabunaka director of the foreign ministrys second north 
american division its their law and doesnt bind japan at all 
but us officials said they interpreted this weeks trade talks 
as a first step in the negotiations required under the super 301 
provision 
we do consider the discussions to be consultations within 
the context of our trade act said deputy us trade 
representative linn williams 
meanwhile us ambassador michael armacost met thursday with 
ryutaro hashimoto secretary general of the ruling liberal 
democratic party 
hashimoto pledged japan would do its best to solve trade problems 
but criticized the us decision to invoke the super 301 clause 
against japan saying we dont like to negotiate with a pistol 
pointed at us kyodo news service reported

advisor immediate family or as required by law 
if laidoff employees refuse to sign their severance benefits 
will be cut to two weeks pay from a maximum of six 
although many companies require new employees to sign 
confidentiality agreements it is highly unusual for a company to 
require terminated employees to sign such an agreement as a 
condition of receiving severance pay 
its not illegal but i wouldnt consider it morally right 
said an analyst with mercer meidinger and hansen a leading human 
resources consulting firm in washington 
nearly all of goldomes laidoff workers have signed the 
agreement sources said 
goldome one of the nations leading thrifts lost 119 million 
last year and is in the middle of a restructuring effort led by new 
chief executive officer thomas cooper 
goldome officials have refused to discuss the layoffs or the 
confidentiality agreement a bank spokeswoman said thursday the 
company had a longstanding policy of not discussing employee matters 
sources within the company said management thinks news of 
goldomes layoffs could cause customers to withdraw money from the 
bank 
the new confidentiality requirement comes after the company 
reduced its severance policy may 1 companies are not required by 
law to provide any severance pay but most offer it as part of a 
benefits package to attract qualified employees and as a 
humanitarian gesture

wheat futures prices slipped thursday on the 
chicago board of trade while corn and soybeans closed mixed on 
profittaking after two straight days of sharp gains 
slack export demand and expectations for a weekend of good 
harvest weather in the great plains weighed on the wheat market 
corn and soybean trading was choppy and notably quieter than in 
wednesdays session when a 30day national weather service forecast 
for warmer and drierthannormal conditions in the midwest sparked 
the strongest oneday rally in nearly 10 months 
selling in both the corn and soybean markets was offset by buying 
linked to wednesdays national weather service sixto10day 
outlook which predicted warmer drier weather in the corn belt next 
week and to weakness in the dollar which could encourage foreign 
purchases of us grain 
at the close wheat was 1 cent to 5 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 394 a bushel corn was unchanged 
to 2 cents higher with july at 259 a bushel oats were cent to

europes leaders are divided over whether to 
endorse a us plan for easing the debt of third world countries a 
top european trade official said thursday 
failure by prosperous european nations to support the plan could 
undermine the package proposed last march by treasury secretary 
nicholas brady for reducing by 20 percent the debt owed by the 39 
largest debtor nations 
the us plan will be one of several major topics of conversation 
at the summit of the worlds seven leading industrialized nations to 
be held in paris next month said jacques delors president of the 
commission of the european communities 
president george bush is hoping to win approval for the package 
and consolidate the success of his new administrations other major 
foreign policy initiative the proposal adopted earlier this month 
by nato to reduce superpower troops and weapons in europe 
delors who met with bush on wednesday said the 12nation 
european organization is trying to reach agreement on its position 
so that it can present a united front at the paris summit the eec 
takes part in the annual summits as the eighth participant and four 
of its members britain france italy and west germany also take 
part individually 
there is a different approach among the eec members delors 
told reporters im not sure well succeed in reaching a 
consensus he added 
the leaders of the eec are meeting in madrid later this month to 
discuss a compromise being fashioned by the host nation spain 
other eec officials said 
chief among the european detractors of the brady plan appear to 
be britain and west germany whose approach is more 
conservative said an eec official who spoke on condition he not 
be named 
the british and germans are concerned about the plan because they 
view it as a bailout of the large commercial banks which hold much 
of the estimated 370 billion debt said the official 
the us proposal encourages the banks to voluntarily forgive a 
portion of the debt burden in return for guarantees that the rest of 
the money will be repaid those guarantees are to be provided by the 
151nation international monetary fund and its sister organization 
the world bank 
banks have so far been lukewarm to the plan saying the 
guarantees offered by the world bank and imf are insufficient 
critics of the plan say wealthy governments should offer additional 
guarantees 
brady was in europe earlier this month seeking to enlist the 
support of governments and international bankers 
the brady plan could suffer another setback if its first phase 
negotiations under way in new york between mexico and its debtor 
banks remain deadlocked bush had hoped to have the agreement 
ready as a model to be presented to his fellow leaders in paris

the stock market moved sharply lower today 
pressed down by weakness in bond prices and futuresrelated selling 
a setback for bonds spilled over into the stock market analysts 
said todays weakness in the credit market which recently has 
rallied on rising optimism that a robust dollar would attract 
foreign investors coincided with a steep slide in the dollar 
wall street analysts also said trading maneuvers related to 
stockindex futures contributed to the selloff stocks are being 
sold ahead of fridays triple witching hour when stockindex 
futures index options and options on individual stocks expire 
analysts detected little reaction to a commerce department report 
showing the countrys merchandise trade deficit fell to 826 
billion in april 
the improvement in the trade balance was largely expected but 
economists are doubtful the deficit will continue to shrink due to 
the recent strength of the dollar which makes american exports more 
expensive for foreign buyers 
evidence of slower economic growth didnt evoke much of a 
response in the stock market either 
the federal reserve reported that the operating rate for us 
factories mines and utilities dropped in may to 838 percent down 
03 percentage point from the previous month the fed also reported 
that the pace of industrial production held steady in may

hog futures prices climbed thursday on the chicago mercantile 
exchange amid expectations for stronger pork demand late this summer 
due to an anticipated tightening of beef supplies 
on other markets oil futures prices rose precious metals were 
higher and grains and soybeans were mixed 
hog futures settled 05 cent to 90 cent higher with the contract 
for delivery in june at 4797 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 10 cent to 150 cents higher with july at 3430 cents a pound 
live cattle were 15 cent to 35 cents higher with june at 7142 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 52 cent higher with 
august at 8097 cents a pound 
the contract for august delivery of hogs posted the sharpest 
gain 90 cent at least partly on expectations that consumers will 
be looking to buy more pork in august because beef prices are likely 
to rise 
the prediction is based on anticipation that fridays 7state 
cattleonfeed report from the agriculture department a monthly 
tally of the cattle being fattened for slaughter in the seven 
largest producer states will show about a 15 percent decline in 
may feedlot placements compared to last year 
if a smaller number of cattle were placed on feedlots this past 
may than were placed a year earlier the number of cattle ready for 
slaughter by midsummer will also be smaller than the previous year 
analysts expect fridays report to show fewer placements because 
of relatively large placements earlier this year due to dry pasture 
conditions in the west 
were looking for tighter supplies of beef down the road and 
that creates demand for competitive meats such as pork said paul 
georgy president of allendale inc a futures brokerage firm in 
crystal lake ill 
cattle futures prices advanced moderately in line with firmer 
cash prices in cautious trading ahead of fridays cattleonfeed 
report 
crudeoil futures finished higher but well below the days highs 
on the new york mercantile exchange on signs of tightening supplies 
of the usproduced crudes that give the highest gasoline yields 
each day there is becoming less and less of the light sweet 
crude oil in the midcontinent said peter beutel an energy 
analyst with elders futures inc in new york 
beutel said the low oil prices of the mid1980s discouraged 
domestic oil exploration so supplies of popular domestic crudes 
such as west texas intermediate are relatively low 
west texas crude for july delivery climbed as high as 21 a 
barrel thursday but settled at 2057 a gain of 34 cents from the 
previous session other crude contracts settled 17 cents to 26 cents 
higher heating oil was 36 cent to 70 cent higher with july at 
4626 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 12 cent to 48 cent 
lower with july at 5944 cents a gallon

currencies gave preciousmetals prices a boost on new yorks

i have thanked god that i am alive today if 
air crew members cannot get better support than we had on this 
flight i feel we should tender our operating certificate to the 
faa 
that was the verdict of john rosser second officer on eastern 
airlines flight 9 from miami to guayaquil ecuador on aug 4 1988 
a flight pilots describe as a brush with death of which the 295 
passengers were unaware 
the regularly scheduled threehour trip in a lockheed l1011 
tristar illustrates what many eastern pilots call the range of 
maintenance problems that have plagued the airline the safety 
question has emerged as an element in the pilots union decision to 
honor a strike by mechanics that began march 4 
a copy of the flight 9 pilots report an internal document of 
the air line pilots association was obtained by the associated 
press the report gives the impression that nearly everything that 
could go wrong did 
eastern declined to comment on the flight 9 report the faa 
which is monitoring easterns compliance with maintenance 
procedures also declined to comment officials at both the airline 
and the federal agency had been informed of the incident the pilots 
say 
as outlined in the pilots account one of three electrical 
generators on flight 9 wasnt working one of three air conditioners 
was defective creating cabin temperatures near 100 degrees 
fahrenheit the temperature gauge for one engine turbine had been 
reported as inoperative several times over the previous four months 
the omega longrange navigation system required by federal 
regulations for flying over water was found unreliable when checked 
against other navigating devices aboard the flight recorder or 
black box was inoperative the fuel gauge was inaccurate 
those deficiencies the pilots contended should have been 
corrected before the flight but were superficially patched or passed 
over in a rush to get off the ground 
in addition human error saddled the plane with around 15000 
pounds of extra fuel in the wing tanks making the right wing 
heavier than the left the report charged 
a faulty count recorded 200 passengers instead of 295 and the 
crew was short 50 meals 
according to the flight 9 report entry by bill homer 53 a 
30year eastern veteran who captained the plane his inspection of 
the maintenance log before takeoff from miami showed the turbine gas 
temperature system hadnt been repaired despite several reports 
homer told his supervisor mike vaughn easterns chief pilot 
that he wouldnt fly the aircraft because he considered it unsafe 
homer quoted vaughn as responding that he didnt like his 
attitude 
the first officer on the flight glyn taylor also told vaughn he 
felt the plane was unsafe and would put the crew under too much 
stress to fly taylor said he was suffering from stress and high 
blood pressure because of the situation 
vaughn ordered taylor to report to easterns medical facility for 
a psychiatric evaluation he later took medical leave according to 
homers report 
another first officer was called to replace taylor meanwhile 
the flight had been scheduled to leave miami at 115 pm edt but 
was delayed for hours by the inspection check and the encounters 
between the pilots the new first officer arrived at around 7 pm 
and the flight departed around 730 
fifteen minutes later homer recounted in the report he realized 
the fuel gauge was inaccurate and the plane was carrying 15000 
pounds of extra fuel because of a faulty calculation by ground 
staff at that point a flight attendant entered the cockpit and 
informed homer that they were 50 meals short when homer replied 
that there were only 200 passengers aboard the attendant said there 
were 295 
the extra fuel and 95 passengers created a weight problem for the 
tristar homer decided he must make a careful overweight landing in 
guayaquil and ruled out the options of dumping fuel or returning to 
miami 
an overweight landing involves increased landing speeds with 
unusual stress on the landing gear and tires the report notes 
after delicate procedures and visual checks of the wing flaps 
homer landed safely in guayaquil he refused to fly the next 
scheduled leg of the flight to quito

the dollar plummeted thursday in a sharp reversal 
of its recent rally as traders who had been boosting the currency 
started selling it in droves 
market watchers said there seemed to be no fundamental news to 
account for the dollars drop which amounted to 25 percent or more 
against the british pound west german mark and japanese yen 
instead traders said the dollar appeared to have risen too far 
too fast in recent weeks and may have been ripe for a selloff by 
speculators anxious to cash in their gains 
it was just inevitable we would reach some level where there 
were just no more buyers and the sellers would gain the advantage 
said bob giordano chief dealer at bank leumi trust co in new york 
some traders also said the dollar was hurt by weakness in the 
bond market which followed the governments report showing may 
industrial production was stronger than expected raising concerns 
about resurgent inflation 
the dollar sank 4 yen to about 145 japanese yen and 5 pfennigs to 
about 198 west german marks the british pound rose 4 cents to 
155 
for a number of weeks the dollar had been rising against major 
foreign currencies reaching levels not seen since 1987 or late 1986 
in defiance of waves of dollarselling by government central banks 
trying to curb the rally 
a rising dollar increases american buying power overseas but also 
raises the cost of us exports

prices higher however a change in the method of delivery of crude 
oil to various customers had some investors worried 
traders said some customers who had been receiving wti were 
getting similar light sweet crude that met their specifications but 
was not wti 
what were seeing is for some reason a bit of a panic on 
delivery of spot crude said greg dreis a broker with merrill 
lynch energy futures the contract just says it must be a sweet 
light crude and some wti is being replaced with foreign and other 
oil 
observers said that in some cases buyers who want only wti are 
being asked to pay extra for delivery 
analysts said july crude prices also were pushed higher by 
investors buying before the contract expires on tuesday

confidence

account for the dollars drop which amounted to 25 percent or more 
against the british pound west german mark and japanese yen 
instead traders said the dollar appeared to have risen too far 
too fast in recent weeks and may have been ripe for a selloff by 
speculators anxious to cash in their gains

were just no more buyers and the sellers would gain the advantage

report quoting unidentified sources saying the bank of japan would 
continue to sell more than 1 billion a day in the open market if 
necessary to restrain the dollars recent rally

rose in early june the federal reserve board reported thursday 
the fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply m1 rose 
23 billion to a seasonallyadjusted 7760 billion in the week 
ended june 5 from a revised 7737 billion the previous week 
initially reported at 7739 billion 
the central bank said the money measure known as m2 rose 40 
billion to a seasonally adjusted 30801 billion from 30761 
billion the previous week 
an even broader measure m3 rose 68 billion to a seasonally 
adjusted 39633 billion from 39565 billion 
m1 includes cash in circulation deposits in checking accounts 
and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in announcing the latest figures the fed also said the may 
declines of 97 billion in m1 and 83 billion in m2 were the 
largest monthly declines in those measures in the 1980s 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the fed in february reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3 
percent to 7 percent growth in m2 and 35 percent to 75 percent 
growth in m3 the fed has not set a target for m1 growth since early 
1987

a strong dollar is good for buyers of toyota 
camrys but bad for the people who make film for eastman kodak co 
its bad for foresters in the northwest but good for wine buyers on 
park avenue 
for the nation as a whole a strong dollar raises the likelihood 
of a recession economists say 
the dollar has soared this year causing reappraisals by everyone 
from carbuying consumers to chief executives of the fortune 500 a 
rising dollar increases american buying power abroad and at home for 
foreignmade goods but also makes us exports more expensive and 
therefore less competitive 
whats not clear is how long the dollars rally will last it 
suffered a sharp setback on thursday when a round of panicky selling 
drove the currency down 25 percent against the british pound west 
german mark and japanese yen 
thursdays steep drop raised the possibility that the longterm 
downtrend in the dollar that began in early 1985 was reasserting 
itself 
if the downward trend were to be reestablished this rally 
would look like a little wart or a bump on the side of a hill 
said christopher probyn a financial economist at drimcgrawhill 
inc 
before thursdays drop the dollar had reached heights not seen 
against various major currencies since 1987 or late 1986 
if vacationers are any measure most americans have not changed 
their behavior much yet in response to the dollars rise the 
nations biggest chain of travel agencies ask mr foster travel 
says the increase in bookings to foreign destinations has been 
negligible 
buyers of imported cars are not seeing the benefit of the 
dollars strength yet although toyota motor sales usa inc says it 
will take the rise into account in august when it makes pricing 
decisions on its 1990 models 
it certainly takes the pressure off the need for price hikes 
said jr olson a toyota spokesman but he added theres no 
telling where the yen is going to be two months from now 
a bottle of white wine from australia say a sutherland 
semillon costs 9 now compared to 10 in early 1988 at acker 
merrall amp condit co in manhattan 
employees and stockholders of companies such as kodak and 
weyerhaeuser co that rely on exports are concerned about the 
dollars strength 
weyerhaeuser said the combination of the strong dollar and strong 
customer demand in the past year has driven to 840 from 725 the 
price per metric ton it charges in europe for its northern bleached 
kraft pulp which is used in making paper products 
that could make it tougher to compete against rival scandinavian 
producers 
for kodak we are concerned let me put it that way 
spokesman henry kaska said it can affect our competitive 
position 
there is a lag time of about a year before this starts catching 
up with you but were concerned and well be increasingly concerned 
if this upward trend doesnt reverse itself he said 
thirtyfour of 52 economists surveyed in early may by blue chip 
economic indicators of sedona ariz were counting on the dollar to 
decline into 1990 helping the economy 
in spite of that twothirds expected a recession later this year 
or next year if the dollar rises that would increase the chance of 
a recession said bob eggert editor of the survey 
it is weakening the one area of the economy trade which has 
the kind of strength necessary to keep the economy out of a 
recession so its serious said dris probyn 
at a time when the economy already is slowing the dollars 
strength could be the fatal blow to the longest peacetime expansion 
in us history one that dates to the fall of 1982

unicorp canada corp spurned last month in a bid 
to buy dunkin donuts inc took on a partner thursday and launched 
a 3053 million hostile tender offer for the doughnut store chain 
unicorp and another torontobased firm cara operations ltd 
offered 43 a share for dunkin donuts which has said it wants to 
remain independent and set up a series of defensive steps 
dunkin donuts vice president and treasurer richard n hart jr 
said the company would have no comment on the latest offer 
dunkin donuts stock closed at 3962 a share in national 
overthecounter trading unchanged from wednesdays close 
unicorp a real estate banking and energy firm controlled by 
toronto investor george mann previously indicated it might try to 
buy the doughnut chain on its own since december it has built up a 
12 percent stake in the company which has 71 million shares 
outstanding 
last month unicorp proposed a friendly 42ashare or 2982 
million buyout that dunkin donuts rejected 
unicorp and cara a food service company that has franchised more 
than 500 restaurants said their offer expires july 13 and is 
conditioned on obtaining at least 75 percent of dunkin donuts 
stock 
dunkin donuts based in randolph mass has franchised more 
than 1700 doughnut shops worldwide and reported profits of 135 
million on sales of 1128 million last year 
after unicorps merchant banking arm kingsbridge capital group 
began buying large numbers of shares last spring dunkin donuts 
began to shore up its takeover defenses creating a poison pill 
shareholder rights plan and an employee stock ownership plan 
a poison pill enables a company to issue additional stock in the 
event of a hostile takeover bid driving up the cost of buying the 
firm 
dunkin donuts also announced plans to repurchase 14 million 
shares of its common stock and has sold 28000 convertible preferred 
shares for 28 million to general electric capital corp 
ge capital is acting as a white squire lending support to 
dunkin donuts management 
the doughnut chains moves are similar to the strategy polaroid 
corp used to defeat a hostile bid by shamrock holdings inc earlier 
this year 
unicorp and cara operations filed suit thursday in state court in 
delaware where dunkin donuts is incorporated challenging the 
employee stock plan the stock buyback and the preferred stock sale 
unless the suit is successful securities analysts have said the 
bidders will have difficulty obtaining the 75 percent of the shares 
required under the offer 
i dont see how they can get 75 percent when management owns 15 
percent the employees have 15 percent and ge capital has 10 
percent said roger lipton an analyst with ladenburg thalmann in 
new york 
lipton called the 43ashare offer more than fair and said 
unicorp and cara may live to rue the day they bid so much 
they are taking a very big gamble in offering top dollar for a 
franchise operation where relationships are so important he said 
this is not a manufacturing operation its a service business 
where the relationship between management and the franchisees is 
very meaningful 
unicorp spokesman eric w evans said the bidders believe they can 
run dunkin donuts successfully and expand its foreign operations 
rapidly 
canada is very underdeveloped for dunkin donuts and worldwide 
there is potential too he said 
unicorp took on a partner because cara has expertise in the food 
business evans said 
dunkin donuts itself has pointed out that kingsbridge doesnt 
have any operating experience in the food service industry evans 
said but cara does 
cara provides airline catering runs duty free stores in 12 
canadian airports and has two large franchised restaurant chains 
125 swiss chalet family restaurants in the united states and canada 
and 230 harveys hamburger restaurants in canada it reported sales 
of 560 million last year 
unicorp is canadas 15th largest company with assets of 48 
billion it has three main businesses natural gas distribution and 
energy services lincoln savings bank in new york city and a us 
real estate portfolio and merchant banking

coleco industries inc agreed thursday to 
be bought by hasbro inc for 85 million marking the likely end of 
the company that made the hottestselling toy in us history the 
cabbage patch kids doll 
hasbro the largest american toymaker will receive all of 
colecos product line which includes scrabble and parcheesi board 
games as part of the allcash deal coleco chairman morton handel 
said 
the deal still must be approved by us bankruptcy court in new 
york where coleco swamped with 5403 million in debt sought 
protection from creditors a year ago a hearing on the sale is 
expected next week or in early july handel said 
avonbased coleco is to receive warrants to purchase 1 million 
shares of hasbro stock as part of the deal hasbro based in 
pawtucket ri will get inventory equipment to make products and 
some accounts receivable 
appalachian artworks inc creator of cabbage patch kids and 
coleco directors also must approve the deal which must be completed 
by july 17 
if the deal is approved most of colecos 250 employees are 
expected to be laid off although some may be hired by hasbro 
handel said 
coleco has about 75 salaried workers in avon 75 in mayfield 
ny and a total of about 100 assembly line workers at both 
locations 
coleco always stood for innovation and the ability to take 
risks said paul valentine a toy analyst with standard amp poors 
corp in new york the industry is poorer because of their 
demise 
russian immigrant maurice greenberg founded the connecticut 
leather co in 1932 the company expanded its leather and shoe 
products line to toys in 1954 and its name was changed to coleco in 
1961 
analysts said coleco ran into trouble after the phenomenal 
success of the cabbage patch doll which became the bestselling toy 
of alltime with more than 600 million in sales in 1985 
david leibowitz senior vice president of american securities 
corp said coleco borrowed money to expand after the cabbage patch 
success 
but when cabbage patch kids sales tumbled and new products 
including adams home computer and toys based on the rambo movies 
did not sell coleco couldnt pay off the new debts he said 
they managed their company for a sales revival that never 
came valentine said 
hasbro which makes gi joe mr potato head my little pony and 
transformers had sales of 134 billion last year up from just 
1043 million in 1980 hasbro in the last decade has bought 
bigname companies including milton bradley co and introduced a 
steady stream of new products 
hasbro executive vice president barry alperin said of the coleco 
deal it means the acquisition of good stable game products like 
scrabble parcheesi and aggravation and its a good chance to 
add to our toy division 
after the transaction coleco will have as much as 150 million 
in cash 85 million from hasbro and about 65 million it had in 
banks in midmarch handel said the cash will be used to pay off 
the companys debts he said 
coleco also said it would retain some real estate assets which 
will be converted to cash 
the companies also agreed that hasbro will participate in coleco 
business operations up to the close of the transaction as part of a 
management consulting agreement

the government said thursday that the us trade 
deficit narrowed dramatically to 826 billion in april its lowest 
level in nine months but even the bush administration is concerned 
that the strong dollar could stunt future progress 
aprils deficit was down 134 percent from a revised march trade 
gap of 954 billion the commerce department reported the 
improvement reflected a 08 percent increase in exports to a record 
3057 billion and a 26 percent drop in imports to 3884 
billion despite rising prices for foreign oil 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher hailed the report as evidence 
of continued improvement in us trade performance but he added 
a note of caution 
while the april data are encouraging it is always unwise to 
put too much weight on any one or two months figures in these 
volatile statitics he said the recent strength of the dollar 
leads us to be concerned about the economys ability to sustain the 
excellent trends seen so far 
the bush administration has been hoping for continued progress on 
narrowing the trade gap to spur economic growth last years big 21 
percent drop in the trade deficit from an alltime high of 1521 
billion in 1987 accounted for nearly half of all us economic 
growth 
many analysts are concerned that the trade gap could start to 
widen again due to the recent strength of the dollar which makes 
us goods more expensive on overseas markets and imports cheaper 
for american consumers 
the dollar reversed path thursday as traders who had been 
boosting the currency started selling it heavily the us currency 
dropped 25 percent or more against the british pound west german 
mark and the japanese yen 
traders said there was no fundamental news to account for the 
drop and that it appeared instead the dollars quick rise may have 
made it ripe for a selloff by speculators anxious to cash in their 
gains 
it was just inevitable we would reach some level where there 
were just no more buyers and the sellers would gain the advantage 
said bob giordano chief dealer at bank leumi trust co in new york 
for the first four months of the year the trade deficit was 
running at an annual rate of 1094 billion well below last years 
actual deficit of 11976 billion aprils trade gap was the 
smallest since an 802 billion deficit last july 
so far this year were going great guns said economist maury 
harris of painewebber inc in new york but eventually this 
higher dollars going to eat into exports 
economist cynthia latta of data resources inc in lexington 
mass said that while us businesses have improved their 
competitive position in the world marketplace were not going to 
hold on to that competitive position if the dollar continues to 
rise 
however william t archey vice president of the us chamber of 
commerce said that with aprils favorable report worries about the 
impact of the dollar on the trade deficit have been revealed as 
exaggerations 
analysts said the narrowing of the deficit so far this year even 
as foreign oil prices have marched upward has been partly a 
reflection of a general slowdown in an economy that is sucking in 
fewer foreign goods 
in another sign of a slowing economy the federal reserve 
reported thursday that the operating rate for us factories dropped 
in may to 838 percent down 03 percentage point from the previous 
month the fed also reported that the pace of industrial production 
held steady in may 
analysts said the easing of factory use could help relieve 
inflationary pressures in the economy 
on the trade front imports fell in april to a seasonally 
adjusted 3884 billion reflecting declines in sales of foreign 
cars manufactured capital goods and agricultural products 
the dip occurred even though the bill for foreign oil jumped 99 
percent to 405 billion the average price of a barrel of oil shot 
up 116 percent to 1783 in april the fifth straight monthly 
increase 
us exports meanwhile hit a record 3057 billion in april as 
foreign sales of americanmade industrial supplies manufactured 
capital goods and consumer goods all increased 
as usual the united states posted its largest trade deficit in 
april with japan but the 389 billion gap was down sharply from 
422 billion in march 
other large deficits were recorded with taiwan 840 million 
south korea 545 million canada 477 million and brazil 365 
million 
the nations trade picture was helped by a second straight 
surplus with western europe the surplus registered 232 million in 
april and 397 million in march 
on tuesday the government reported that a broader measure of 
us trade worsened dramatically during the first three months of 
the year the commerce department said the deficit in the current 
account was 7 percent larger than in the final three months of 1988 
that deficit figure reflected improvement in merchandise trade but a 
widening of the deficit in the services category

michael milken whose financial wizardry helped 
reshape 1980s corporate america but also led to his indictment for 
fraud and racketeering resigned thursday from drexel burnham 
lambert inc to form his own business 
during his 19year career at drexel milken widely was credited 
with creating a 175 billionayear market in the lowcost 
securities called junk bonds that turned drexel from a wall street 
alsoran into an investment powerhouse 
but the federal government alleges milken used his powers through 
drexel to engage in a range of securities crimes including schemes 
with nowjailed stock speculator ivan boesky 
it was unclear what the impact of milkens departure would have 
on the governments case or on drexel where milken still commands 
tremendous loyalty among some key junk bond employees and many 
drexel clients 
milkens new consulting firm international capital access group 
will advise and assist companies seeking to raise money to start up 
expand or stay in business it will not buy or sell securities 
people familiar with milkens plans said 
milken had been on leave from drexel since his march 29 criminal 
indictment on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering his brother 
lowell who also was charged in the case announced thursday he was 
quitting the firm to return to practicing law 
drexel is the only company ive ever worked for since 
graduating from college and its the only one i ever expected to 
work for michael milken said in a statement 
i am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave drexel as 
part of the firms settlement with the government but i look 
forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies he 
said 
under a civil settlement with the securities and exchange 
commission of insider trading and other charges drexel in may 
agreed to sever ties with milken and to bar its employees from 
direct or indirect business dealings with him 
michael milken made many important contributions to drexel 
burnham and his resignation although not unexpected is a sad 
event drexel stated we wish him well in his new endeavor 
milken has been accused of insider trading in a separate sec 
lawsuit no settlement has been reached and no trial scheduled in 
that case 
milken 42 joined drexel fulltime in 1970 after graduating from 
the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania in 1978 he 
moved drexels entire junk bond division to beverly hills calif 
and revolutionized the sale of the securities in the 1980s 
milkens aggressive sale of junk bonds previously used mainly 
by companies with low credit ratings helped fuel the decades 
corporate takeover mania by giving small and mediumsized companies 
and some corporate raiders a more accessible tool for financing 
growth mergers and takeovers 
he also earned enormous sums according to court papers milken 
made more than 1 billion from 1983 to 1987 including 550 million 
in 1987 
the criminal securities and racketeering indictment against 
milken marked the pinnacle so far of the governments threeyear 
crackdown on wall street crime a broader indictment of milken also 
is expected 
milkens trial in us district court in manhattan is set for 
march 1990 under the racketeering provisions milken faces up to 
185 billion in forfeited illegal profits he would also be subject 
to huge fines and a lengthy prison term if convicted milken is free 
under a 700 million bond package 
lawyers close to the case indicated milkens decision to resign 
may have been calculated by quitting milken preempts the firms 
agreement with the sec to dismiss him once its settlement is 
approved by a federal judge 
approval has been delayed pending milkens challenge to certain 
provisions governing his employment status but the supreme court 
this month refused to hear milkens case and the sec and drexel soon 
are expected to ask us district judge milton pollack to ratify the 
agreement 
but with milkens resignation lawyers may argue that parts of 
the drexel pact are moot and mount further challenges to the case 
they also are expected to challenge the provision barring drexel and 
milken from doing business with the same clients 
people familiar with milkens plans said his new firm has a 
handful of employees and a temporary office in los angeles no one 
working for drexel has been hired and the firm does not intend to 
take people from drexel they said but there could be defections 
milkens statement said his firm would provide advice and other 
assistance to individuals communities and companies and 
emphasize the creation of ownership opportunities for employees 
minorities and unions

gd searle amp co has agreed to settle all 
claims and lawsuits alleging injury from the use of searles copper 
7 contraceptive device that were brought by a law firm representing 
over 100 such clients a company spokeswoman said thursday 
searle spokeswoman kay bruno said the agreement which still 
requires approval from the clients represented by the law firm of 
robins kaplan miller and ciresi of minneapolis bars disclosure of 
the terms and conditions of the settlement including the number of 
claims settled 
ms bruno confirmed the june 9 agreement in response to questions 
from the media she also said the settlement does not have a 
materially adverse effect on the financial positions of searle or 
its parent monsanto corp 
ms bruno said the settlement leaves about 350 other pending 
copper7 lawsuits in state and federal courts 
women who brought lawsuits against the skokie illbased 
pharmaceutical concern contend the copper7 once one of the 
nations most widely prescribed intrauterine devices caused pelvic 
inflammations ectopic pregnancies or perforation of the uterus and 
could result in infertility 
searle pulled the product from the market along with a second iud 
in january 1986 citing the high costs stemming from hundreds of 
lawsuits the company has maintained in court documents the product 
cannot cause the various injuries plaintiffs claim 
ms bruno said at last count 330 cases involving the copper7 
had been disposed of prior to trial in our favor of the 19 that 
went to trial we won 15 and lost four 
two of those are pending appeal and of the two completed we 
have paid a total of about 300000 she added 
esther kociemba represented by the minneapolis firm was awarded 
8 million last year by a jury in st paul minn 
it could not be determined whether that case was part of the 
settlement the law firm said previously that it represented more 
than 100 people in such copper7 litigation 
michael ciresi who has been the firms lead attorney in copper7 
cases did not return calls seeking comment left with his office 
attorney h robert erwin jr of baltimore whose firm is handling 
similar copper7 cases said typically iud cases can range from 
10000 if the causation is weak and the injury nominal to 250000 
or more if you have a young married couple rendered childless due 
to an infection from an iud 
erwin said his firm had not been similarly approached by searle 
about a settlement

when eugene qahhaar started docks takeout 15 
years ago he was just another black businessman peddling hot dogs 
and hamburgers from a rundown storefront on the south side 
but since 1984 qahhaar has taken on new partners docks has 
expanded to 17 outlets in this city and five more in philadelphia 
and he has set his sights on becoming a major force in the fastfood 
industry 
what sets docks apart in the fastfood freeforall is the fish 
that anchors the menu dipped in a spiced batter concocted by 
qahhaar its not spicyhot he calls the flavor continental 
qahhaar and partners dennis robertson president of fishy 
things inc docks parent company and qahhaars former landlord 
joe pecora hope to find a niche for docks in middleclass black 
communities around the country before taking on a broader market 
in the beginning i did not set out to create an ethnic 
business said qahhaar whose partners are white i wanted 
something to apply across the board 
but docks started out in a black neighborhood and business was 
booming so they concentrated on that market though the first 
downtown sitdown docks is to open in chicago later this year 
four years ago there were four docks last year a surge of 
growth brought 11 more to the chicago area and put the fledgling 
chain in philly 
franchises offered for the first time this year make up three 
of the 17 area outlets operating now robertson said 
within four years the partners want 28 companyowned restaurants 
and 40 franchise operations in such cities as detroit cleveland and 
st louis 
docks takeout menu offers batterfried fish sandwiches fish and 
chips catfish and smelt as well as fried shrimp seafood salad 
chowder gumbo cole slaw and onion rings for dessert sweet potato 
pie bean pie embellish the more routine offerings of cheesecake and 
carrot cake 
the fish sandwich whiting fried in polyunsaturated oil is 
just sensational robertson said 
docks orangewhiteandgreen shops have a 1950s flavor with 
portholes and roped timbers a spoutingwhale logo and the slogan 
that great fish 
we dont go into standard buildings so the colors are really 
what alert the people robertson said noting docks prefers to 
rehabilitate abandoned innercity stores and gasoline stations 
docks owners have their work cut out for them partly because 
seafood can be a tricky menu item in the competitive fastfood 
business most people still prefer burgers 
fish chains have had a bad time arthur treachers is an 
example although they are making somewhat of a comeback said 
stuart meyer professor of policy and environment at northwestern 
universitys jl kellogg graduate school of management 
but a distinctive product can make the difference 
offering something that is successful in one place makes it 
easier to penetrate other markets if its really new meyer said 
docks can make it with proper financial backing and a solid 
management formula meyer said if docks achieves success in the 
inner city the market will look more attractive to others 
qahhaar says hes sure he has a winner 
docks is expected to top 11 million in sales this year in the 
city up from 10 million in 1988 he said 
the philadelphia outlets which did 19 million in sales last 
year are being franchised robertson said 
while the partners have been approached about selling stock to 
the public to raise money for more expansion robertson said we 
need to do some growing and proving this kind of success can be 
replicated elsewhere 
qahhaar in his 40s opened his first restaurant in 1973 selling 
hot dogs and hamburgers he named the place after his father dock 
meadows an alabama house painter qahhaar formerly eugene meadows 
changed his own name when he converted to islam 
one night a muslim selling fish door to door offered him a good 
deal if hed buy 50 pounds of whiting business was poor so he gave 
it a try 
i bought some spices and made up a recipe said qahhaar i 
made several batches of batter and the one i liked was the one i 
kept 
the fish was gone in a week but the customers who bought it kept 
coming back 
by 1975 docks was specializing in seafood but qahhaar was 
having trouble making ends meet five years ago despite a thriving 
business he was months behind in rent 
his thenlandlord pecora introduced him to robertson then part 
owner of several sizzler restaurant franchises in area suburbs 
robertson remembers he didnt look forward to the meeting he was 
doing fine and had no desire to get involved in an innercity 
business 
there was a great line of people outside waiting to get 
served he recalled i said what does he need us for thats 
when joe revealed to me that he owed him a lot of money 
a cordial relationship developed and the partnership in which 
each controls a third of fishy things inc robertson shed his other 
business interests 
robertson concedes the innercity locations could hold down 
profits because of generally lower household incomes but notes 
there are advantages including high population density and fewer 
competitors 
property is cheaper and there are plenty of rehab opportunities 
qahhaar says hes taken some heat for taking on partners but has 
few regrets 
i look upon myself as a creative person administration is not 
my strong suit i struggled along for several years not getting the 
company to the point where i wanted to he said 
if you have to do things to make it stronger to get more money 
or better management skills then you do it qahhaar said 
pecora handles real estate decisions and robertson the business 
end at fishy things headquarters in southwest suburban willowbrook 
when robertson came aboard as a partner he had a portfolio the 
banks could respect qahaar recalled we received banker 
support paid debts a lot of problems were eliminated
