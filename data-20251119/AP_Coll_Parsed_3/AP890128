grand opera as grand as it gets filled the 
metropolitan opera stage in the first performance this season of 
verdis don carlo 
james levine conducted on friday night bringing out the operas 
orchestral glories and at times threatening to drown out the 
singers but the soloists had powerful lungs and the large chorus 
soared vocally over the orchestra 
tenor neil shicoff was don carlo betrothed to elizabeth 
daughter of the french king after they meet and fall in love they 
discover that a treaty has given her to carlos father philip ii of 
spain the fallout from that plus the spanish inquisition is 
plenty for an opera even one as long as don carlo 
shicoff began too loud but quickly settled into a wellsung 
feeling portrayl margaret price sang elizabeth her voice is 
beautiful smooth and large at the end of the third long scene 
singing to a banished countess miss price sounded tired but she 
recovered before act 2 
both shicoff and miss price were singing their parts for the 
first time at the met 
baritone bernd weikl as rodrigo was more brusque than subtle he 
sounded as though he were pushing for volume ruggero raimondi his 
voice very focused was impressive as king philip 
tatiana troyanos always a favorite of the met audience was fine 
as princess eboli she didnt wear the eye patch that was part of 
the costume when this production was new 10 years ago the real 
eboli wore one but since don carlo is more drama than history 
and the stage eye patch was distracting miss troyanos was better 
off without it 
the autodafe scene was lavish with clerics onlookers and flag 
wavers the royals and grand inquisitor janhendrik rootering wore 
black trimmed in gold heikyung hong sounded celestial as the 
celestial voice however in this staging she welcomed those burned 
into heaven before anybody lighted the fire 
don carlo was last sung at the met during the 198586 season

rope steers or whoop it up at a saloon no sirree mister these 
folks are the biggest bunch of prosepackin simileslingin 
versifyingest cowboys you ever saw and theyre here for the annual 
cowboy poetry gathering 
it aint all dogie doggerel and you better smile when you quote 
em pardner 
upwards of 7000 visitors have jammed this northeastern nevada 
town of 13000 for the five dayevent which began wednesday and 
wraps up sunday 
the areas 40 motels have been booked for weeks tengallon hats 
dot railroad avenue and commercial street and more spill out of the 
branding iron bar 
the crowds have come to hear the cowboys recite their bunkhouse 
ballads sing soulful songs and tell of hard and high times on the 
range 
the activities have filled every available meeting place in town 
from the elko convention center to the bar at the stockmans hotel 
the buckaroos don fancy duds for the gathering broadbrimmed 
stetsons silver buckles and handmade pointytoed boots but their 
sunburned faces calloused hands and faraway gaze tell their own 
tales of hard and solitary lives 
one such poet is waddie mitchell who runs 2000 head of cattle 
on a ranch near jiggs before he came to the gathering he had to 
make sure there was enough hay put out and find a baby sitter for 
his five children 
mitchell began writing verse during long winters on the range 
like most cowboy poets he didnt show his work to many people 
because poetry didnt quite fit the cowboy image 
but the first cowboy poetry gathering five years ago brought a 
lot of sagebrush scribes off the prairie 
one of mitchells poems tells the plight of tom odell found 
behind a bar with his throat cut when they got him to the 
hospital he wouldnt sign a complaint against the fella who done it 
because he was a friend of his 
mitchell and baxter black who will sing and tell stories at the 
saturday night finale are big guns in the cowboy entertainment 
world they have ben on the tonight show and blacks records 
are available anywhere western music is sold black a veterinarian 
from brighton colo earns a sixfigure income from his 
performances 
gary mcmahan a singer songwriter and poet from bellvue colo 
who claims to have the only yodeling dog recited this verse at one 
gathering 
two things in life that i really love 
thats women and horses of that im sure of 
so when i die please tan my hide 
and tool me into a saddle so fine 
and give me to a cowgirl that likes to ride 
so in the hereafter i may rest 
between the two things that i love the best 
besides stage performances there are informal sessions for 
greenhorn poets singers and storytellers exhibitions display 
handmade saddles bits spurs and other cowboy regalia 
tara mccarty of the western folklife center in salt lake city 
which coordinates the gathering said one of the centers biggest 
challenges is keeping the cowboy poetry pure 
thats why theyve come up with an ironclad rule every 
participant has to make a living on the range no drugstore 
cowboys allowed

one of the largest processors of george bushs 
favorite snack food is hoping to catapult the product to national 
popularity with a new brand presidential pork rinds 
ill be on the street with them next week bill connor sales 
manager for evans food products co said friday 
the brand is a takeoff on the presidents wellknown 
predilection for the porcine product a gift jar of pork rinds 
replaced ronald reagans crystal container of jellybeans on the 
table at bushs first cabinet meeting this week 
george bush has done wonders for pork rinds here this year 
said al rickard a spokesman for the snack food association in 
alexandria va 
my view is skins are in pork rinds in 89 said connor 
who sent 3000 pounds of the crunchy puffed snack to washington for 
the presidential inaugural ball and in return got an invitation to 
the event 
pork rinds are fried pieces of hog skin cooked in hog fat 
stored in pellets for 30 days and fried again for 60 seconds in oil 
heated to 400 degrees at which time they explode like popcorn 
connor said 
evans food products with a plant on chicagos south side 
supplies pork rind pellets to dallasbased fritolay the largest 
us marketer of pork rinds and other companies connor said 
evans handles about 50 million pounds of pork skin annually 
he said pork rinds compare favorably to peanuts in fat content 
and contain a high percentage of protein nutrition experts 
however say the salted snack has enough calories fat and sodium to 
make it a poor food for all but the most physically active people 
with the lowest cholesterol levels 
the snack food association said pork rind sales totaled 195 
million in 1987 a figure dwarfed by sales of potato chips which 
enjoyed 38 billion in sales in the 8 billion salty snack food 
market

the debacle for rajiv gandhis congress 
party in a major state election this past week was the latest in a 
series of reverses for the prime minister who will face his own 
voter test by the end of the year 
gandhi 44 had a dream start as prime minister his party won 
fourfifths of the 542 seats in parliament in 1984 but allegations 
of corruption a belligerent opposition headed by a former cabinet 
colleague and successive defeats in state elections raise doubts 
about his return for a second term 
the congress party has lost 11 of its last 18 state elections 
the latest defeat was jan 21 in populous tamil nadu state where it 
won only 26 of the 234 state assembly seats 
gandhis problem is a failure at the political level said 
bhabani sengupta one of indias foremost political analysts its 
a pity because he came in with a tremendous amount of goodwill and a 
tremendous amount of promise 
in january 1985 the former airline pilot was sworn in as prime 
minister after his congress party swept the highest number of 
parliamentary seats ever won by a single party since india became 
independent in 1947 
the victory was ascribed mainly to the wave of sympathy for 
gandhi after his mother prime minister indira gandhi was 
assassinated three months earlier 
but it was helped also by gandhis mr clean image which 
sprang from his age and inexperience in what many people saw as the 
dirty world of politics his stewardship gave the government an 
unprecedented honeymoon with the press even normally 
antiestablishment newspapers were enthusiastic 
the parliamenary election gandhi won four years ago has 
created an illusory world for him the hindustan times a usually 
progovernment newspaper said in an editorial this week this 
kind of mandate breeds dangerous smugness 
the cracks did not appear for almost a year the first murmurs 
against gandhi began with his inability to solve the lingering 
problem of a murderous sikh insurgency in the northern state of 
punjab 
the low point came in 1987 when newspapers claimed the swedish 
arms company ab bofors paid 50 million in bribes to secure a 
government contract for artillery guns 
gandhi denied involvement a parliamentary committee cleared the 
government of complicity but the allegations persist and are still 
under investigation in the midst of the allegations vp singh 
who had held the defense and finance portfolios in gandhis cabinet 
quit the party after building a reputation as a crusader against 
corruption 
singh went on to win a parliamentary byelection as an 
independent running on a cleangovernment platform in the past six 
months he has been largely successful in persuading national 
opposition parties and regional parties to form a national coalition 
opposed to gandhi 
in indias 41year history no single opposition party has ever 
posed a serious threat to the congress party instead the 
opposition has been splintered among powerful local parties and a 
vast array of national parties 
the only time congress ever lost a national election was in 1977 
when the opposition united after mrs gandhi imposed an emergency 
and banned political activity 
if the opposition is united and can present itself as a 
creditable alternative then the congress party will be in very 
serious trouble said sengupta the political analyst 
at least seven parties have joined the antigandhi front and 
together they control seven of indias 25 states last weeks polls 
in tamil nadu voted the fronts dravida munnetra kazhagam party into 
power and the congress trailed a poor third behind another regional 
party 
it will be dangerous for the congress to believe that what 
happened in tamil nadu was only a regional phenomenon the 
hindustan times said no state is out of the national mainstream 
what happens at the polling booth in tamil nadu has also an impact 
on the rest of the country

america must be ready to use the crowbar of 
retaliation to open world markets says president bushs nominee for 
top us trade negotiator while bushs choice as housing secretary 
called the appalling problem of homelessness his top priority 
retaliation cannot be the goal of our policy in fact it 
signals the failure to open foreign markets washington attorney 
carla hills said friday before the senate finance committee approved 
her nomination as us trade representative 
but the credible threat of retaliation provides essential 
leverage in our marketopening efforts said the former secretary 
of housing and urban development in the ford administration thus 
actual retaliation will be used albeit reluctantly to preserve the 
credibility of this threat 
pledging to fight to open global markets with a crowbar if 
necessary she said we have to have our agreements enforced 
she said and where our partners are violating our agreements we 
must take action 
the panel was unanimous in recommending senate confirmation of 
the 54yearold california native to succeed clayton k yeutter who 
has been tapped by president bush for secretary of agriculture a 
confirmation hearing has yet to be scheduled for yeutter 
appearing before another senate panel former rep jack kemp 
rny said about homelessness i acknowledge that it is a very 
severe problem it is an appalling problem it is an emergency 
problem and im willing to treat it as the highest priority 
immediately of my new leadership at hud 
the 1988 candidate for the gop presidential nomination avoided 
committing himself on most specific spending questions but did 
pledge to be an advocate for increased federal efforts to house the 
poor 
he promised to seek full funding of legislation passed by 
congress to provide emergency shelter for the homeless called the 
mckinney act and said he favored expanding it in some areas 
kemp said he visited privately with leaders of miamis riottorn 
overtown and liberty city areas last weekend when in that city for 
the super bowl he said that if confirmed he planned to visit 
blighted inner cities and places where the homeless cluster 
the senate banking committee took no vote on kemps nomination 
but the hearing was filled with bipartisan praise for the nominee 
who is expected to win confirmation easily a committee vote may 
come next week after kemp answers additional written questions 
mrs hills sought to dampen concern that she could become 
vulnerable to conflictofinterest charges because she and her 
attorney husband roderick hills have represented foreign law 
clients 
let me address the question of potential conflicts of interest 
right away she said there are none 
lawmakers seemed satisfied when she promised that she and her 
husband would divest themselves of any business interests that could 
present such a conflict she also pledged to keep hands off cases 
involving her former clients 
kemps appearance was interrupted briefly by six demonstrators 
from the community for creative nonviolence a washington advocacy 
group for the homeless two stood up holding a large sign saying 
housing now while they and others shouted and turned on a 
noisemaking machine 
the four women and two men were charged with disrupting a 
committee of the congress and demonstrating within a capitol 
building charges that carry a maximum 500 fine and sixmonth jail 
term

three congressmen with defenserelated 
committee assignments say they were unaware of receiving illegal 
corporate contributions through a consultant who pleaded guilty in 
the governments investigation of pentagon corruption 
the circumstances of this contribution were totally unknown to 
me and i am returning it immediately sen jim sasser 
dtenn said in a statement after learning friday that his campaign 
had received 1000 illegally 
rep richard ray dga said he was extremely upset by the 
news that joseph e hill 76 of mineola ny had given money to 
his campaign he said he too would send the money back 
between 1982 and 1988 hill contributed over 25000 to political 
campaigns at the direction of his consulting client unisys corp a 
giant computer company that does work for the defense department 
prosecutors said federal election law says individuals may give 
1000 in general and primary campaigns but corporations are 
prohibited from donating money 
hill and robert d barrett a former unisys executive entered 
guilty pleas to a variety of charges in us district court in the 
latest development in the pentagon investigation 
also pleading guilty before us district judge claude a hilton 
was jack sherman a civilian purchasing official with the marine 
corps sherman 52 admitted he accepted bribes in exchange for 
providing confidential information on pending contracts to 
consultants and companies he could face up to 20 years in prison 
and a fine of as much as 500000 
hill pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts of making 
political contributions in the name of another namely his client 
he could face up to four years in prison and a fine of 400000 
prosecutors said hill was paid by sperry which later merged into 
unisys and was asked by representatives of sperryunisys to make 
numerous contributions in his name 
besides the campaigns of sasser and ray hill also contributed in 
1987 and 1988 to the campaigns of reps roy dyson dmd and 
william dickinson rala prosecutors said 
it angers me that someone would give my campaign illegal 
money ray said ray sasser and dyson said they knew nothing 
about the source of the money when it was given dickinsons 
spokesman mike lewis said his boss was also in the dark about the 
contribution 
barrett 55 pleaded guilty friday to conspiracy to defraud the 
united states and to aiding and abetting in making false statements 
to the government he could face up to 10 years in prison and a 
500000 fine 
barrett who first worked for unisys predecessor sperry corp 
in the washington suburbs was involved in a complicated scheme in 
which 2000 was funneled to the election campaign of former rep 
bill chappell dfla prosecutors said 
chappell chaired the house defense appropriations subcommittee 
until his defeat last november 
prosecutors said the contractor paid consultants with the 
understanding that they would contribute an unspecified portion of 
the funds to political campaigns in december 1986 barrett 
collected two undated checks of 1000 each from two men and steered 
them to the bill chappell campaign committee chappell 
repeatedly denied any wrongdoing while he was in congress 
fridays pleas are part of the federal governments twoyearold 
investigation into the pentagons 150billionayear procurement 
practices the case includes allegations that private consultants 
hired by defense contractors bribed pentagon officials to obtain 
inside information that gave companies an edge in securing contracts

members of congress are urging president bush 
to reassure savings and loan depositors by swiftly developing a plan 
to pump more money into the ailing government insurance fund for 
sampls 
public confidence is so precarious today that it is imperative 
that a comprehensive approach be presented soon said rep jim 
leach riowa the secondranking republican on the house banking 
committee 
the exact nature is not as important as the fact that a serious 
package be presented he said 
bush sought friday to stem nervousness following scattered 
reports that some sampl depositors withdrew their money after learning 
that the administration is considering a 25cent fee on every 100 
in federally insured accounts 
the savings and loan deposits are backed by the full faith and 
credit of the government and they are sound they are good bush 
told reporters at the white house i want to assure the american 
people of that and thats not going to change 
however bush said he has made no decisions on a plan for the sampl 
problem and would not rule out the deposit insurance fee 
there seems to be some controversy around it but that doesnt 
mean that any thinking along those lines should cease the 
president said 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee said in a statement that the bush administrations 
disarray on the sampl crisis is contributing to a growing nervousness 
among depositors 
savings and loans are receiving a heavy run of calls from 
depositors who are confused and concerned about the reports of a new 
tax on their deposits gonzalez said in some areas there have 
been higher than expected withdrawals of funds 
m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
disputed gonzalez assertion saying it was based on an inartful 
distillation of calls made by somebody on the committee staff 
however in an interview a day before wall said there have been 
cases where they depositors say i dont like what i heard on tv 
im taking my money out 
bank board spokesman karl hoyle said a survey of thrift 
institutions thursday night showed no outflows of any significance 
that we can attribute to anything thats been said 
gonzalez accused the administration of being extremely 
careless in floating the deposit fee trial balloon and called on 
bush to take a personal hand in clarifying the administrations 
proposal 
the treasury department has been studying the sampl problem since 
the fall and is expected to present bush with its recommendations 
next week department officials have been briefing members of 
congress on some of the options under consideration in addition to 
a deposit fee 
rep stan parris rva a senior member of the banking 
committee said treasury is talking about borrowing about 45 
billion roughly the amount needed over and above the 38 billion 
committed last year and is examining the full range of options of 
how to pay it off 
the laundry list includes using interest on federal reserve funds 
that is now paid into the general fund or tapping the retained 
earnings of the industryowned regional federal home loan banks 
options in the reform package that will accompany any new money 
include an administrative merger of the fund that insures commercial 
banks with the sampl fund as well as additional control by federal 
regulators over risky activities undertaken by statechartered sampls 
parris said

air fares since 1985 generally have increased 
much faster than average at airports largely controlled by single 
airlines according to a new government study of those hub 
operations 
the present situation at hub airports is intolerable sen 
john danforth rmo said friday in releasing the study prepared by 
the transportation department 
he blamed the increases on a lack of competition at some airports 
in the wake of deregulation of the airline industry in the 1970s 
under deregulation most airlines have adopted hub and spoke 
operations to help lower their costs the concept involves having 
flights from smaller airports feed into a central airport or hub 
where passengers make connections for their ultimate destinations 
the study found that air fares rose substantially above national 
averages from 1985 to 1988 at more than a halfdozen hub airports 
dominated by single airlines st louis charlotte nc 
cincinnati detroit minneapolis raleigh nc and salt lake city 
the increases in most instances were twice or nearly three 
times greater than the air fare portion of the consumer price index 
during the same period the study looked at average roundtrip 
ticket prices for passengers beginning or ending their flights at 
the hubs 
fares rose an average of 111 percent across the nation from 1985 
to 1988 the study said it said fares for the biggest carriers at 
two major airports either rose less than the national average or 
dropped over the threeyear period 
from 1985 to 1988 according to the study 
piedmont airlines fares rose 34 percent over three years at 
charlotte where the airline had 89 percent of the market last year 
delta air lines fares rose 25 percent at cincinnati where the 
company had 81 percent of the market 
northwest airlines fares rose 27 percent at detroit where the 
airline had 62 percent of the market 
northwest fares rose 21 percent at minneapolis where the 
airline had 77 percent of the market 
american airlines fares rose 35 percent at raleigh where the 
airline had 67 percent of the market 
delta fares rose 26 percent at salt lake city the airline had 
77 percent of the market 
delta fares rose 5 percent at atlanta where the airline 
controls 62 percent of the market 
usair fares dropped 6 percent at pittsburgh where the airline 
had 80 percent of the market 
the study focused however on lambertst louis international 
airport and the effects of a 1986 merger that made trans world 
airlines the dominant carrier of passengers in and out of the city 
don morrison a twa spokesman in st louis disagreed with 
danforths reading of the report he said the study did not link the 
increases to the airlines control of the market at its st louis 
hub 
the dot study found that twa fares at lambert for nonstop 
roundtrip travel increased 227 percent from the first half of 1985 
to the first half of 1988 the airline component of the cpi rose 
111 percent during the same period 
i dont there is any correlation between the fare increases and 
the hub operation said morrison he attributed the increases to 
market forces 
the report did not examine in detail the other airports it cited 
the fares at other concentrated hubs only to show that twas air 
fares had not increased faster than comparable airports across the 
nation 
however the study cautioned hub concentration alone does not 
explain why fares change or how much they change

a a slight cold 
but its been a full week since inauguration 
i just wanted to stop by under our new policy give you an 
update 
ive been talking this week about ethics and the emphasis is 
not believe me a fad or some passing fancy 
were going to be hearing more about it i think a lot more 
in broader terms im trying to set high standards for government 
service duty honor personal sacrifice for the common good 
and i want to assemble a government that the people of this 
nation can be proud of thats our goal thats our mission 
we did appoint this week as you know a new commission on ethics 
weve got two able chairman vice chairman judge malcolm 
wilkey and general griffin bell 
we appointed that commission started a fresh constructive 
dialogue with congress on both sides of the aisle 
im pleased with the way those initial meetings have gone and so 
were ready to roll 
i think its been officially announced that were going to 
certainly to tokyo then on to china which im looking forward to 
very much 
and then also well be stopping for a relatively brief stop in 
korea on the way back from china 
weve had other invitations 
thats about all we can do 
and on a nostalgic basis needless to say were barbara and i 
are looking forward in a very personal way to going back to beijing 
now with no further ado ill be glad to take your questions

q mr president you said before you became president that you 
supported ronald reagans decision on a 50 percent pay raise for 
members of congress and that you might have something more to say 
about it once you got to the oval office most of the polls show 
that the vast majority of americans oppose that pay raise now 
youre president whats your view on that pay increase 
a well i did say i supportd it and i do support it 
a raise is overdue theres no question about that 
there are some good things in this 
the reform of the honorarium payments for these speeches i 
think is very very good 
i think its good government 
its a complicated formulation 
there are some elements that bother people including me 
but the president did consider all this carefully 
he went forward with the commissions recommendation 
and that because of the way it works in congress and the ball 
is clearly in their court it leaves us with either the commission 
recommendation or nothing 
and so seeing the problems as i do i still feel that i should 
not go about undoing the reagan decision 
yeah helen 
q mr president your trial balloon on the sampls taxing savings 
and checking accounts has fallen like a lead balloon are you 
dropping that plan do you have any other plans in the works 
a in the first place i think itsa little absurd to be 
commenting on a facet a possible facet of solving a problem when 
it hasnt even come to me 
youre talking about speculating on something that hasnt even 
reached the desk of the president even as an option to say nothing 
of its being a proposal 
and so 
q come from your people 
a well as an option not as a proposal 
and i think youre right there seems to be some controversy 
around it

but that doesnt mean that any thinking along those lines should 
cease 
but im going to reserve comment until i actually have it 
presented to me 
and i expect this is the first of many such things thats going 
to happen of this nature 
i will say this that the savings and loans deposits are backed 
by the full faith and credit of the government 
and they are sound 
they are good dollar good 
and i just want to assure the american people of that 
and nothing is going to change in that regard 
but in terms of this one idea let them float it around 
it doesnt bother me for a lot of ideas to be considered and 
debated 
q the reaction is very negative the public reaction and 
congressional reaction will that enter into your decision 
a anything i do on savings and loans or when we get into this 
budget deficit reduction program look i dont expect its all 
going to be sweetness and harmony and light 
the minute we get those proposals up there on feb 9 i expect 
were going to have other firestorms swirling around 
but i have not made decisions on this one 
ill wait till i get all the facts call them as i see them and 
hope that we can convince the american people that thats the way to 
go 
yes brit 
q mr president youve set a tone of highmindedness and 
propriety this week with your emphasis on ethics also 
bipartisanship in your discussions with congress beyond those 
matters of process and tone sir what would you like the country 
and the world to say is the message of your first week in office as 
to what your administration is about 
a reaching out to the congress 
i really am serious about this trying to get more of a bipartisan 
foreign policy for example 
and though we havent addressed that specifically in terms of 
issues i have addressed it in broad terms to the members of 
congress with whom ive met here and with whom ive met over in the 
residence 
and so id like to signal an era of real openness with congress 
look i know were going to have conflicts brit and i know 
were going to run up against each other 
but i want to start with that approach and were going to 
were in a broad review as youve heard from my various nominees as 
they appear before the senate on specific areas of foreign policy 
but a message would be taking steps to make clear to the 
congressional leadership that thats what i want to do 
the other one as i mentioned is trying to set a tone in terms 
of conflict of interest that i hope will serve us in good stead

q mr president there seems to be some question about just how 
long your no tax pledge applies is that a oneyear pledge a 
twoyear pledge a fouryear pledge 
a id like it to be a fouryear pledge 
and 
q is it a fouryear pledge 
a id like it to be a fouryear pledge yeah 
q mr president yasser arafats been over in europe meeting 
with the foreign ministers of spain france and greece marlin has 
said and so has brent scowcroft that its too early for arafat to 
meet with jim baker on what level would it be appropriate for 
arafat to meet with an american official an assistant secretary of 
state for example 
a we changed the policy on the middle east on dealing with the 
i mean as change came about in the policy on communicating with 
the plo it was based on their acceptance of three principles 
as long as they stay hooked and stay committed to those three 
principles we will have when appropriate meetings with the plo 
i havent given any thought at all to what what when a 
meeting with the chairman arafat with an american official is 
appropriate 
and i would wait to see how we go forward 
the point in talking to them is to try to facilitate peace in the 
middle east 
and it seems to me that if theres some logical step that 
requires highlevel signoff by various participants over there 
then and then only would it be proper to elevate the meetings to 
that level 
were just starting 
you crawl before you walk 
were just starting to talk to them because they have 
dramatically id say agreed to the to the principles that are 
part of our policy 
q let me ask you again in that regard you said in a wire 
service interview the other day that you needed to have some foreign 
policy initiative early in your administration it seems the soviet 
relationship is going on the back burner while you discuss the 
nuclear force structure for example in what area are you going to 
try to move forward central america the mideast where 
a all of them 
but weve got to have a little time 
were not going to let this soviet thing put us in a mood of 
mode of footdraggers 
were going to be out front 
theres no reason to suggest that all we have to do is react to a 
speech by the general secretary 
i want to take the offense in moving this relationship forward 
and doing taking steps that are in the interest of the free 
freedom around the world whether its in eastern europe or in 
strengthening our alliance 
but theres plenty of trouble spots 
one of them as you mentioned i think central america but we 
need to complete the reviews 
but i cant tell you john which one will become where you 
will see the first major initiative whether its going to be the 
middle east whether its going to be central america 
weve got problems of course that afflict the whole continent 
and other continents in this third world debt problem and then of 
course the soviet union 
but no i dont want to play defense and i dont want to look 
like were footdragging just waiting around to to you know let 
others set the agenda 
but prudence is the order of the day 
and when youre gunning for something as important as a 
bilaterally supported policy in central america it does take a 
little time 
ive only been here less than a week 
yes

q as you know the minimum wage has been frozen for even longer 
than congressional pay raises since you support a large increase in 
pay for the most affluent 1 percent of the country will you favor 
pushing for an increase in the minimum wage which would benefit the 
lowest income groups in the country as part of your promise in your 
inaugural address to reach out to all the people 
a i would ive always said that my position on minimum wage is 
that i would want it linked to a training wage to a differential of 
sorts so that you dont throw people out of work by raising the 
minimum wage 
and im not one who has felt that the minimum wage is the key to 
economic prosperity for the lowest people on the lowest end of the 
economic spectrum 
but as i indicated a certain flexibility on that question 
and again ill wait for elizabeth dole who takes office in the 
next couple of days to come in with her recommendations 
saul 
q if i could just follow do you are you 
a how are we going to wait let me ask you to stop the 
proceedings dont take it out of their time 
how are what would be the fair and noble way to handle 
followup questions as we do these things 
would it be good to have them or not have them 
q there should be two followups 
q yes one followup 
q there should be one followup 
q there should be two followups 
a but then youve cut out but then if we do it everybody else 
doesnt get a chance to ask their question becuase im about to 
pull a rip cord on this thing laughter 
no seriously how do we i want some advice 
q come back every day laughter 
q if you make a statement and not have anyone follow it up 
it just hangs out there 
q suppose you dont answer 
a you mean my first answer is less than precise laughter 
q on occasion 
a on occasion laughs 
no but im asking weve got to get id like to get because 
here we are all of these 
q to follow up 
a women and men who have to let that the leubsdorf area 
untested on the question 
q one followup 
q the standees 
q well just have to be more precise 
a and the standees have gotten no time at all 
q a true followup 
a instead of yet another question you mean 
q you decide when you think somebodys playing games with you 
say im sorry 
a ill just say ive already answered that 
then what happens laughter 
saul 
q wait a minute wheres my followup 
a laughs you didnt have a followup 
q gets a followup then

a ok 
q are you concerned from the standpoint of perception that 
youre supporting a pay raise for a highincome group and not 
pushing on an equal basis for a lowerincome group will give the 
publics perception that youre lobbying for a wealthy sector of the 
country 
a no im not concerned about that perception because but i am 
troubled by certain aspects of the proposal as i think ive 
indicated the pay raise proposal 
but were down to the crunch here 
the recommendations up there on the hill its either yea or 
nay 
i mean its one way or another 
but i dont think that would be fair at all 
i think the main thing in terms of the question you raised jobs 
how do we continue to create jobs keep it going 
and ive given you one ingredient that i think has to be a part 
of the of any consideration of the minimum wage but as ive 
indicated im flexible on how that should be accomplished 
but im not sure that one could make a connection between the 
minimum wage and more employment 
i think you can if you raise the minimum wage without this 
difference so i think you will reduce employment 
so i think the main thing in the area youre talking about is 
how do we increase economic opportunity 
and maybe there is a way to do it but i dont think it would be 
fair to say when you take a pay raise that affects a tiny fraction 
judges and congressmen that that has a broad economic impact on 
the country 
ive expressed some concern about it but for other reasons 
yes 
q do you agree with senator towers testimony in which he 
doesnt seem to believe that the sdi program as envisioned by 
president reagan is likely and if you do agree with it can you 
expand on that please 
a no i think i should wait and see a little more what john 
tower means 
my position has not chaned on sdi 
q which is john tower said that he doesnt believe that a 
largescale sdi would protect the population as envisioned by reagan 
 
a i better yes 
q do you disagree with that 
a saul before i comment on towers testimony i better read it 
if hes talking about a shield so impenetrable that you have no 
that that eliminates the need for any kind of other defense i 
probably would agree with that certainly shortrun 
but i better cover by waiting until i see what he said 
the standees two standees alone 
q thank you the first action taken by your secretary of state 
was to order the boarding up of embassy in kabul does that indicate 
that this administration and this country then has no influence with 
the rebels and you are now fearful of chaos and massacres there 
and to what extent did you discuss this with gorbachev the other day 
a i did not discuss it with him the other day 
and what it indicates is a prudent policy to protect a handful of 
american life 
and its a step that other countries have taken in afghanistan 
there is certainly i think wed all agree there is 
uncertainty about what follows 
im convinced the soviets will continue their withdrawal and 
well they should 
but it is simply a prudent way in which to protect life 
i think weve had meeting after meeting with afghan rebels and 
theres no question in their mind how we feel about say a soviet 
presence in that country 
but i think theres a lot of uncertainty and theres enough 
uncertainty that a secretary of state was taking prudent action in 
this regard

q what role do you see for the united states after the soviets 
withdraw in that country 
a catalytic role for helping bring about stability hopefully in 
a government where the people have a lot of say and it wont be 
easy 
yes tom 
q mr president id like to try the pay raise one last time as 
you just said its not just for members of congress and its not 
just for federal judges its for a lot of senior officials in the 
government political appointees you also have told some reporters 
in recent days that youre concerned about the longterm pension 
implications of all these larger salaries wouldnt you be happier 
with a pay raise thats a little bit less rich than 50 percent 
a i dont have that option to get into that now 
i have i think expressed myself in the past on separating out 
some of these categories 
but were not regrettably youre never dealing with just the 
way i would like it to be 
and so ill just leave it that what my earlier statement 
q sir this is a thematic question youve had a week on the 
job has it been easier or tougher than you expected any surprises 
and did you find the note in your underwear 
a no note in the underwear 
and its been a good easy week and i expect it will change 
dramatically in the days ahead 
but my view is to if it werent for the cold smile and 
enjoy it while you can because i can already sense you know 
looking forward to a little more a little more confrontation out 
there 
q have there been any surprises sir 
a none particularly no 
it it and i think one of the reasons is that ive been around 
here in a different role for eight years and then in and out on 
other jobs 
so its but theres the still the wonder of it all 
i mean it still feels different but not surprises 
q a followup sir 
a youve already a followup 
nice try 
rita laughter 
q mr president there seems to be some brouhaha about the fact 
that bill bennetts not an actual member of the cabinet as are the 
ustr and the omb directors in light of the fact that you 
emphasized drugs as an overriding consideration in your campaign 
and also that public opinion polls show consistently this is among 
the top priorities of the public why isnt he in the cabinet and 
do you foresee that you might change your mind on that 
a no the reason he isnt in the cabinet is that ive tried to 
reduce down the numbers of full cabinet members 
and i think that bill bennetts time is best spent not worrying 
about agricultural subsidies but when we have a meeting on 
agriculture but concentrating on drugs 
to the degree theres symbolism that this means i think its less 
important id like to knock that down hard 
and i have to do that in substantive ways sitting at his side as 
we meet with his peers at cabinet level making clear to them that i 
will be insisting on cooperation as he asks for the support of the 
defense secretary for military assets on interdiction as he asks 
for the support of the education secretary on certain educational 
initiatives 
but the cabinet rank is there giving him the standing that i 
think the job not only requires but demands and i think his i 
think the idea of not sitting through cabinet meetings that have 
nothing to do with that subject should be the reason that a 
rationale for having cabinetlevel but not being in all those 
meetings 
ive seen im glad he mentioned this because i think theres 
been some feeling well that means im less interested in drugs 
thats not right 
im not im very interested in the economic statistics but our 
chief of economic advisers is not a cabinet member as he has been 
designated by previous presidents 
our chief of staff in whom i have full confidence is not a 
cabinet member but i think we have a very strong chief of staff 
setup 
over here way up in the window an innovative stance

q i wonder if i could just touch on the issue of third world 
debt there are many experts who are saying that if there is any 
danger for the us economy its in how greatly leveraged it is 
opposed to terms of corporate indebtedness and third world debt and 
they say that the sampl crisis for example is simply a subsumed 
feature of this do you see this as a real problem that youre going 
to address aggressively and what kind of steps would you take to 
overcome the high proportionality of debt to equity that exists in 
the economy now 
a the question of corporate debt the role on that one the 
role of th white house and the role of the federal government ought 
to be to do its level best to keep a strong economy 
and i dont believe that its the government role to assign 
levels beyond which a corporation cant borrow 
in terms of third world debt we do have a responsibility and a 
lot of thats going to be working with the private banks and others 
and again thats going to be well have some recommendations 
we have to have them pretty soon on that question 
that im not sure i got to the substance of your question there 
but i dont separating out those two things 
q in the reported differences that you have with alan 
greenspans testimony in congress earlier this week with regard to 
interest rates and monetary policy 
a ill be honest with you 
i dont think im far apart from chairman greenspan at all far 
apart 
there may be some differences 
he is because of the plant capacity utilization he is more 
concerned about inflationary pressures than i am right now 
seems to me theres an area of difference 
but basically and generally speaking i think were in were 
fairly close together 
yes 
q mr president by spending your first week dwelling as you 
have on ethics arent you voicing an implicit criticism of the 
reagan administrations record ethical record 
a no 
q then why else was it necessary to declare national ethics 
week so to speak 
a because i feel strongly about it 
q on that also on that line sir 
a no shes first and then you 
need to cool off on that one laughter 
q mr president during given your strong antitax stand in 
the campaign why are you allowing mr brady to consider as an 
option for the sampls a tax increase 
a im not he has thrown out a lot of different possibilities 
in discussions weve had 
we have people that are experts on what a tax is 
i would refer you to richard darman who is the head of the omb 
and hes the guy that defined that very well up there with the 
duck test on the hill 
and 
q so you dont think its a tax 
a well im just saying im not prepared to say what i think on 
it right now till i hear from it because the more i discuss it the 
more you all go out and say this is something that im considering 
when im not 
it hasnt come to me yet 
but ive been around for a long time and i dont remember 
hearing people talk about the fee that went into covering the fdic 
or fslic as a tax 
i dont remember people writing that before 
but im not trying to get into the fight anymore right now 
ill be back yes charles 
q youve mentioned ethics in a number of ways and youve talked 
about the value of service the last few days we picked up the 
headlines in the papers and theyve read the president has 
president reagan has a 5 million book deal hes got a 
50000aspeech deal with all respect for the office and the 
former president do you think its appropriate to cash in on the 
presidency 
a i dont know whether id call it cashing in 
i expect every president has written his memoirs and received 
money for it 
indeed i read that a former president was it grant grant got 
half a million bucks thats when half a million really meant 
something 
i mean you know so i think theres plenty of tradition that 
goes with presidents writing memoirs and being paid for it

q but youve also talked about perceptions is there a 
perception problem here 
a no because i think theres been a long history of that 
and i dont think its ever been challenged as inappropriate 
yes 
q mr president would you try to clear up the continuing 
controversy over the reports of disagreements on abortion between 
your nominee for health and human services and yourself that are 
you in sync is he in sync 
a yes 
q with you does it matter do you have to be absolutely in 
sync as long as once in office he would support your position 
a well i think that last point is the important point 
but also we are in sync 
and so i have a person who has stood in front of you all when i 
nominated him and said that 
and i have no reason to think anything different 
yes 
q mr president a few moments ago you talked about on your 
nonewtaxes pledge the idea that youd like it to be a fouryear 
pledge and that does appear to be a softening of language from the 
campaign i wonder has anything that mr darman or any of your 
advisers told you changed your mind about the duration of that 
pledge revenues needed and so on 
a no that hasnt changed my mind anything in the last few 
days of talking like that 
yes 
q mr president weve been hearing a lot about your position on 
abortion this week because of mr sullivan are you planning any 
initiatives from the white house related to abortion or are you 
going to wait and see what the supreme court does number one and 
number two as a person whos always from what we know had the 
financial and emotional resources to know that you could raise your 
children comfortably do you feel any awkwardness about telling 
other people whose situations you dont know how they should run 
their lives 
a not when it comes to the question of life 
i do feel an awkwardness in terms of having been able to take 
care of my kids when they were sick or raise them properly or 
something like that i feel a certain privilege 
i feel a certain very fortunate in that regard 
and i know a lot of people arent 
but in some on this issue i think were talking here of 
principle and i sure would like to put the emphasis on adoption 
and that means a broader acceptance of that principle 
q are you going to have any white house initiatives or are you 
going to wait for the supreme court 
a oh wait for i think probably wait but i have been pledged 
as you know to an amendment 
but id like to see the supreme court decision as soon as 
possible 
q mr president 
a one two three 
q mr president a tehran radio report this morning seems to 
indicate that they are rejecting your statement of a week ago today 
that good will would beget good will while you didnt specifically 
mention iran by name in your speech what would your message to them 
be on relations and what would your message be to them about 
helping get the hostages out 
a well i would make a broad appeal transcending iran to 
anybody that can be helpful to get the hostages out 
perhaps i havent seen the wire copy but perhaps they are if 
there is such a story by them maybe theyre saying look were 
not holding your hostages 
and id have to say well from our intelligence our 
information thats probably correct probably correct 
in terms of the future there was a period of time when we had 
excellent relations with iran 
and i dont want to want to think that the status quo has to go 
on forever 
but i do think that the renunciation of terror in any form and a 
facilitating to the degree they can the release of the hostages 
would be a couple of good steps they could take

q may i follow up mr president follow up on that 
q mr president 
a no you dont get to follow his question laughter 
anne and then here 
q mr president reaching out 
q youve youve spoken frequently about reaching out to 
blacks that you want that to be an important goal of your 
administration this week the supreme court issued a decision that 
may kill many of the minority setaside programs that have been so 
helpful to blacks across this country does that concern you are 
you worried about these programs 
a i it didnt kill all setasides and it didnt kill off 
affirmative action 
i have been committed to affirmative action 
i want to see a reinvigorated office of minority business and 
commerce 
i want to see our sba program go forward vigorously 
and so i would say that that decision spoke to one set of facts 
in richmond i believe it was 
and but dont read in i will not read into that a mandate to 
me to stop trying on on equal equal employment and on 
affirmative action generally 
yes 
q you said during the campaign mr president that you would 
roll back taxes on capital gains if elected now as you begin to 
look at the budget numbers is that going to be a promise you can 
keep when you make your submission to congress or is that no longer 
affordable 
a i hope it affordable 
it gains you revenue 
and weve got a big argument with some people about that they 
dont want to go back and look at what happened in 1978 it gains 
revenue 
now i know weve got all kinds of bureaucracies around here that 
dont agree with that 
but that was discussed in the campaign 
im convinced it will bring in additional revenue and in the 
process create additional jobs for men and women 
so i would like to see it a fundamental part of whatever we do 
now if your question is can i get it done thats something 
else again 
but i want to see it done 
we there was an issue in that campaign where there was a clear 
difference that was one where there was a clear difference 
the opposition was saying my opponent is proposing something 
that will cost the taxpayer 30 billion 
and im saying it will create jobs 
and indeed ive seen estimates by intelligent people thinking 
it will bring in revenues in excess of 4 billion 
and so im going to keep pushing that because i know its right 
and i ran on it 
yeah robby 
q mr president once more on the pay raise youve portrayed 
yourself as a latecomer on the issue who has no real power to 
affect it but a point of fact i believe that you do have the 
power if you want to to limit the pay raises that would otherwise 
automatically go to your own staff will you do that number one 
and number two do you think both houses of congress ought to vote 
on it 
a well i think in a i think in the best of all worlds 
wait till i get wait till i 
q its a trick question sir laughter 
a laughs hes a fairminded guy laughter 
no i i think our our our chief of staff has tried to hold 
the line on increases in hiring people 
and i think youre all aware of that 
and i think hes done a very good job on it 
i dont know how the law affects the staff in terms of automatic 
automatic increases 
but theres a nice little problem that if you do go forward with 
automatic increases is there any money 
that has to be appropriated in some way 
so well have to talk about what well do 
what was the other part of it

q do you think both houses of congress ought to vote on this 
issue 
a in a in a in a perfect world in a world where you were 
starting over yes id have to say i do 
but that isnt the proposal thats up there 
and its all or nothing 
and in my view ive told you where i come down on that 
weve got time for a couple more because its 385789 5880 
this thing is buzzing away up here laughter 
yes 
q mr president a few minutes ago on the answer concerning the 
hostages you indicated that iran was probably not holding the 
hostages did you mean to say that we believe that iran exercises no 
control over the people who are holding the hostages 
a no i mean to say they are not holding the hostages 
do they have any control we can get varying degrees of 
intelligence on that various assessments as to how much control 
they have over hezbollah or these families or whoever it is 
and also youve got different different groups involved in the 
holding of these hostages 
but what i no im glad to get a chance to clarify it because 
unless the information i have is wrong iran itself the government 
is not actually holding these holding these people 
and if they were you know i would just reiterate my view that 
the way to improve relations is to let them go give these people 
their freedom they didnt do anything wrong 
q and a followup mr president do we believe that iran can 
exercise influence to gain the hostages release 
a i think they can have influence 
yes jerry 
q you inherited a budget from president reagan that calls for 
something like a 2 percent real increase in defense spending in the 
campaign you seemed to think that maybe zero real growth in defense 
spending would be adequate given the deficit pressures do you 
think there is some room for reduction in the reagan defense budget 
to fund some of the other programs like the sampl problem that youve 
got to worry about 
a we are wrestling with that problem right now 
im committed to a strong defense 
i did say certain things in the campaign that fit into our 
flexible freeze concept 
and so we will i will have to address that with some detail on 
feb 9 and i will 
we have time for just a couple of more 
q mr president in the back 
a this is 36 minutes here 
q mr president you said the other day that 
q just say no 
q education was the main way for dealing with drugs 
a yes 
q isnt that a backing away from your commitment on drugs 
certainly there are other things than education to deal with the 
problem 
a absolutely 
and i was surprised when i read that some interpreted what i said 
as for suggesting that interdiction is not important or 
cooperation with foreign governments in terms of eradication at the 
source is not important 
they are very important 
my point is we are not going to solve the problem of drug use in 
this country through interdiction alone through cutting off the 
supply alone 
and a larger component of the solution lies in education and on 
and in that whole demand side of the equation law enforcement at 
home these things 
last one here 
q inaudible 
a look this is a followup

q mr president how much money are you going to spend on drugs 
if its the major problem that you say it is certainly education 
just one very small part of it 
a its not a small part its a tremendous part 
and the federal government can spend some on it and the private 
sector has got to spend enormous amounts 
the media has done a good job in terms of pro bono advertising 
and thats got to be enormously stepped up 
so it look it has got to be a tremendous increase not only on 
the money but the emphasis on the educational side 
i do want to see find a way to step up the total funding on 
antinarcotics and i want to get ill go back to what i said on 
bill bennett because this question of cabinet rank and whether that 
shows less of an interest in narcotics troubles me 
you will see me side by side with bill bennett on in putting 
the proper emphasis from the oval office on my determination to do 
everything in the governments power federal governments power to 
eliminate this scourge 
last one carl 
q is there any 
q mr president you and your aides have talked about the need 
for a fast start and youve talked all week about ethics and about 
bipartisanship and yet the week has been marked by unexpected 
controversies over dr sullivans views on abortion and then the sampl 
issue which is sort of a selfinflicted wound are you finding it 
harder to control an agenda here than you thought you might 
a no no im just getting a preview of coming attractions and 
its been lovely laughter 
and its going to change and i know it 
but no i think its been a wonderfully harmonious week and 
these are just little ripples on the surface of an otherwise calm 
pond 
q youre not concerned that if you just talk about things that 
i mean everyone approves of ethics just about everyone approves of 
bipartisanship isnt there a danger of people saying that you 
know theres not much meat behind the words 
a theres a danger of that yeah but people are realize that 
youve been here four days of this week or five this is the fifth 
day in office after the weekend and they understand that in things 
like the foreign policy area that its prudent to have a review 
they understand that weve got to get our people in place 
and so i theres some danger i guess carl but i wouldnt say 
an overwhelming danger 
i mean we just go for it 
if we just sat around and did nothing except be pleasant to 
people on the hill or something why i could expect that would grow 
a little old for you all 
but were going to were going to i think we did weve set 
a certain tone and a certain outreach and then go forward when as 
soon as these specific proposals start up there whether its on 
education or antinarcotics or on foreign policy or on some 
bilateral foreign visitor coming in there will be plenty of 
plenty of time for controversy and plenty of time for lively debate 
on substance 
but i would simply say that will follow and follow pretty soon 
thank you all very much 
the press thank you

bushs first formal news conference friday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bush said he was not disturbed by the flap in response to reports 
that he was considering a fee that would be charged to sampl 
depositors to raise money for government efforts to deal with failed 
institutions it doesnt bother me for a lot of ideas to be 
considered and debated i have not made decisions on this one 
ill wait till i get all the facts call them as i see them and 
hope that we can convince the american people that thats the way to 
go he added i will say this that the savings and loans 
deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the government 
and they are sound they are good dollar good and i just want to 
assure the american people of that and nothing is going to change 
in that regard

asked about visiting china before responding to soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachevs request for an early meeting bush replied i 
dont know what signal it sends in that regard but let me just 
remind you that im the one who does not believe in quote playing 
the soviet card or quote playing the china card it just 
seemed like an appropriate visit but not to signal a playing of the 
card to go one up on mr gorbachev theres nothing of that nature 
in this visit the visit stands on its own and does not have any 
signaling that should be detrimental to anybody elses interest 
</TEXT>

bush reiterated his position that any increase in the minimum 
wage should be linked to a training wage to a differential of 
sorts so that you dont throw people out of work by raising the 
minimum wage and im not one who has felt that the minimum wage is 
the key to economic prosperity for the lowest people on the lowest 
end of the economic spectrum but as i indicated a certain 
flexibility on that question and again ill wait for labor 
secretary elizabeth dole who takes office in the next couple of 
days to come in with her recommendations

bush said meetings would be held with the plo as long as they 
stay hooked and stay committed to accepting israels right to 
exist renouncing terrorism and accepting two un resolutions 
affirming the right of all middle eastern states to live within 
secure borders if theres some logical step that requires 
highlevel signoff by various participants over there then and 
then only would it be proper to elevate the meetings to that level 
were just starting you crawl before you walk were just starting 
to talk to them because they have dramatically id say agreed 
to the to the principles that are part of our policy

vietnam is thinking of opening the sprawling 
sovietoperated military port of cam ranh bay to all countries 
including the united states says a senator in contact with hanoi 
diplomats 
sen frank murkowski ralaska also told reporters after meeting 
hanois un ambassador that the envoy was very positive about 
the idea of establishing an unofficial american presence in vietnam 
for humanitarian purposes primarily help for amerasian children 
whose mothers were vietnamese and fathers were us servicemen 
during the vietnam war 
murkowski who plans another in a series of visits to vietnam in 
march talked to reporters friday after meeting on capitol hill with 
vietnams un ambassador trinh xuan lang lang was the first hanoi 
official in washington for official meetings since the northern half 
of vietnam became independent from france in 1954 
i asked about the soviet presence at cam ranh bay murkowski 
said referring to the giant port built by the united states during 
the vietnam war and now the soviet unions largest overseas military 
base 
i was very pleased at the response that there is consideration 
given to opening that port up to all the countries of the world 
he said i said sure youd find the united states interested in 
occasionally calling in there 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev last september offered to 
dismantle the base at cam ranh bay in exchange for the united states 
giving up its key bases in the philippines washington reacted 
coolly and later agreed on terms with the philippines for continued 
use of its installations until 1991 
ambassador lang at a meeting with state and defense department 
and national security council officials promised that hanoi would 
continue to cooperate with us efforts to account for about 1700 
american servicemen still missing in the indochina war the state 
department said friday 
the department relaxed rules restricting the un envoy to the 
new york city area to enable him to attend a washington reception 
and used his presence to stress us concern about the powmia 
issue state department spokesman charles redman reiterated that 
normalization of us relations with hanoi depends on complete 
withdrawal of vietnamese military forces from cambodia 
lang said later he was very satisfied with his meetings 
which he said aimed at better understanding and reconciliation 
usvietnam relations sooner or later will be normalized he 
told reporters on capitol hill 
murkowski urged us efforts in the meantime to complete the 
complicated finding and processing for entry to the united states of 
thousands of people enduring hardship in vietnam today because they 
had american fathers or american connections during the war and 
their families 
murkowski said the ambassador told him hanoi was agreeable to 
allowing representatives of us private voluntary organizations to 
establish a humanitarian presence for such purposes in saigon 
since renamed ho chi minh city 
the senator estimated 12000 amerasian children of american 
fathers now young adults remain in vietnam and that with family 
members a total of up to 36000 people could be involved estimates 
of the number of vietnamese marked as us sympathizers and 
subjected after the war to detention and reeducation vary 
widely and have run as high as 500000

two aging nazi war criminals 
pardoned by the dutch parliament arrived in west germany after 
spending 43 years in prison for sending thousands of dutch jews to 
death camps among them possibly anne frank 
west german president richard von weizsaecker praised the dutch 
decision friday to pardon the two war criminals calling it a 
humanitarian act a government spokesman said the men would be 
allowed to settle in west germany 
the dutch decision to pardon and expel franz fischer 87 and 
ferdinand aus der fuenten 79 ended two days of emotional debate 
opponents of the pardon said the men should have remained in jail 
the rest of their lives 
rabbi marvin hier head of the los angelesbased simon wiesenthal 
center wrote in a letter to dutch premier ruud lubbers it is 
unconscionable to release such notorious individuals who perpetrated 
heinous crimes and caused suffering to so many thousands 
avraham soetendorp a prominent dutch rabbi added we saw this 
coming but still it hit us very hard 
fischer headed a local branch of the nazi security service and 
was held responsible for deporting 13000 jews to death camps aus 
der fuenten was an ss administrator who oversaw mass roundups of 
jews in the netherlands 
soetendorp said aus der fuenten may have been indirectly 
responsible for sending anne frank to a concentration camp the 
girl and her family lived in an amsterdam attic for two years before 
they were discovered and sent to concentration camps 
her poignant work the diary of anne frank perhaps the most 
famous personal document to come out of the holocaust was published 
in 1947 and was turned into a play and movie she died of pneumonia 
in 1945 at age 15 in germanys bergenbelsen concentration camp 
a brief film clip on west germanys ard television network showed 
the two fraillooking greyhaired men step out of an ambulance 
ard did not say where the two men crossed the border into west 
germany late friday and gave no other details west german border 
police referred all questions to the federal interior ministry but 
ministry spokesmen could not be reached late friday 
aus der fuentens wife maria lives in an apartment in a 
workingclass neighborhood in duisburg 36 miles from the dutch 
border all the shutters were down and no one appeared to be in the 
apartment late friday 
some residents on the street reacted with anger and disbelief to 
the news that aus der fuenten had been released 
werner dehnen who lives across the street from aus der fuentens 
wife told the associated press i cant help but think of the 
victims families and the pain this man caused 
ute dehnen his wife said ive never spoken to her as a 
matter of principle i would have divorced that man and i cant 
understand why any woman wouldnt 
another neighbor who asked not to be identified said this is 
a quiet decent street and we dont need people like him aus der 
fuenten here for me he is still a mass murderer they shouldnt 
have set him free 
fischer and aus der fuenten were imprisoned for their roles in 
the deaths of thousands of dutch jews during world war ii they were 
sentenced to death in 1950 but a year later their sentences were 
commuted to life in prison 
dutch justice minister frits korthals altes said keeping the two 
in jail any longer would violate the rule of law because the nation 
has pardoned 106 other war criminals who had originally been 
sentenced to death fischer and aus der fuenten were the sole 
surviving exceptions he said 
only two major nazi war criminals are held by authorities in 
foreign countries klaus barbie in france and josef schwammberger 
in argentina 
barbie called the butcher of lyon is serving a life 
sentence in france for war crimes committed in that country 
schwammberger who prosecutors say was responsible for the deaths 
of thousands of people has been jailed more than a year in 
argentina after he was captured outside a germanargentine village 
he is awaiting extradition to west germany 
one of the most notorious nazi war criminals alois brunner is 
reportedly living in syria brunner a close associate of adolf 
eichmann has been held responsible for the wartime murder of 
100000 jews

pakistan is so close to building a nuclear bomb 
that the united states probably wont be able to certify this year 
that the country doesnt have one the reagan administration 
reportedly told members of congress before the former president left 
office 
that certification is necessary if pakistan is to receive us 
economic and military aid beyond the current fiscal year the reagan 
administration had requested 621 million in aid to pakistan for 
fiscal 1990 as part of a 402 billion sixyear package 
the washington post today quoted congressional sources as saying 
they were told by reagan administration officials that pakistan was 
so close to building a bomb that it had been a very close call 
when the administration in november renewed the certification that 
the country does not have a nuclear bomb 
the newspaper said that when the certification was renewed a 
letter was attached to house speaker jim wright dtexas saying the 
administration was nearing its limits of being able to continue 
making the certification 
the congress should be aware that as pakistans capabilities 
grow and if evidence about its activities continue to accumulate 
this process of annual certification will require the president to 
reach judgments about the status of pakistani nuclear activities 
that may be difficult or impossible to make with any degree of 
certainty the post quoted reagan as saying 
without certification required annually under the law pakistan 
will not be eligible to receive us economic and military aid 
beyond the current fiscal year which ends sept 30 
the newspaper said it was not known if president bush will accept 
his predecessors conclusion about pakistans nuclear capabilities 
although bush is known to be extremely concerned about the problem 
of nuclear weapons proliferation 
in his letter to wright the post said reagan said he had made 
his best judgment on the basis of available information to the 
us government based on the standard set by congress regarding the 
pakistani nuclear program 
the standard he said is whether pakistan possesses a nuclear 
explosive device not whether pakistan is attempting to develop or 
has developed various relevant capacities 
reagan said in the letter that the united states remained 
extremely troubled by the continuing risk of a nuclear arms race 
between pakistan and india the post said

president bush visits china next month as an old 
friend of chinas top leaders who has helped the nations weather 
some of their stormiest relations 
bush will be in beijing for two days after the feb 24 funeral in 
tokyo of japans emperor hirohito 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater in announcing the trip 
thursday in washington said bushs close ties with china were an 
element in the decision to visit beijing just one month after taking 
office 
undoubtedly there are some personal issues involved there in 
terms of his relations with deng xiaoping fitzwater said adding 
that bush will show support for dengs economic reforms 
bush has known deng chinas senior leader since he headed the 
us liaison office in beijing in 197475 deng at the time was vice 
premier but was soon to be purged by leftists in the dying days of 
the disastrous 196676 cultural revolution 
deng was firmly in control when bush a candidate for vice 
president returned in 1980 a year after the united states and 
china established diplomatic relations bush deng said was a lao 
pengyou an old friend of the chinese people 
but his welcome was less than cordial the chinese were outraged 
by statements by candidate ronald reagan that his administration 
might restore official ties with taiwan and bush was delegated to 
convince the chinese that there would be no backsliding in 
uschinese relations 
since we are old friends we must be very frank deng told 
bush the official xinhua news agency later said bush had failed 
to reassure china over recent statements by ronald reagan 
but the visit also had its warmer moments bush and his wife 
barbara went shopping for teacups at the friendship store the 
special store for foreigners and walked over to the international 
club there bush renewed acquaintances with the barber the manager 
and the tennis court attendants he had known in 197475 
bush returned as vice president in may 1982 and told 
thenpremier and current communist party chief zhao ziyang we 
feel at home in beijing during our stay here we spent a great deal 
of time on our bicycles touring the city those were happy days 
those were good days important days 
that visit however also was dominated by the taiwan question 
deng spoke of the dark clouds of bilateral relations caused by 
us arms sales to taiwan and bushs mission was to defuse 
beijings demand for a final date by which all arms sales to the 
rival nationalists on taiwan would cease 
at the beginning of his official talks with deng bush asked for 
a fiveminute private meeting instead the two spent two hours 
together and emerged to tell waiting aides that there was no need 
for further discussions 
three months later the sides signed a communique in which 
washington agreed to gradually reduce arms sales to taiwan 
bushs last visit in 1985 was decidedly more relaxed he spoke to 
students in sichuan took a boat ride down the scenic li river in 
guilin and toured the prosperous southern cities of canton and 
shenzhen he also played tennis with thenvice premier wan li 
i like what i see bush told deng we still have 
fundamental differences systematic differences with china but 
were finding more and more things in common 
chinese leaders in a nation where personal ties often outweigh 
ideological concerns unabashedly favored bush in the presidential 
election and believe that the new administration will have better 
understanding of and sympathy for china because of bushs many 
contacts here 
deng in a meeting with defense secretary frank carlucci in 
september startled us officials by saying he hoped chinas old 
friend bush would win the election

as the soviets head home a faint wind 
of change is stirring at kabul university cradle of the afghan 
intelligentsia whose marxist revolution this impoverished moslem 
country has rejected 
at the semester that started last fall a majority of academic 
staff voted for the science and agriculture faculties to scrap 
courses in marxiststyle ideology that have been compulsory for all 
the 7000 students since the 1978 revolution 
hardline members of the governing peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan still hold key academic positions at the university 
which numbers among its graduates of the early 1970s afghan 
president najib a physician and a dozen of his top political 
associates 
but for the first time since the revolution deans who are not 
party members five out of 13 according to the new engineering 
dean were appointed last fall 
also the ussponsored faculty of engineering is to reopen in 
march at the end of the current extended winter vacation it was 
closed after soviet troops arrived in afghanistan in december 1979 
to try to quell the rebellion 
in a desolate building which houses the faculty the laboratories 
are stripped of most equipment and text books are more than a decade 
out of date the most talented lecturers long ago went into exile 
at the entrance two holes in plaster remain where 
revolutionaries ripped down a plaque stating the faculty was a gift 
from the united states 
for five years until 1963 the faculty was linked to the 
university of wyoming and then sponsored jointly by 11 american 
universities and technology institutes 
because the soviet presence was so strong here they the 
afghan regime wanted to pretend to them that anything that was not 
sovietrelated was bad said ata mohammad nazar the new dean of 
the faculty 
nazar 45 has a masters degree and doctorate in civil 
engineering from colorado state university and earns the equivalent 
of 250 a month 
huddled over a single heater in a bonechilling office nazar 
nurtures a folorn hope that us universities will resume support 
of the faculty even though najib remains shakily in power as the 
soviets depart 
the soviets are due to leave by feb 15 under a unmandated 
agreement signed in geneva 
but there is no sign of peace with moslem rebels still fighting 
najibs regime western countries are withholding aid and refuse to 
deal with a regime they believe will fall after its soviet 
protectors depart 
the engineering faculty the only one that taught in english 
before the revolution plans to resume teaching in english 
with educational standards plummeting through years of war and 
russian more widely taught than english nazar faces a tough task 
he complained that western countries which cut ties with the 
university in 1978 now punish the wrong people 
we feel isolated he said the russians say they made a 
mistake coming here so why should we take the blame 
to remove this government and install another is it worth it 
they will defend themselves how many more afghans should die he 
added 
in a nearby administrative building dr mohammad khamrani 35 a 
founding party member who has the title of vice chancellor for 
social and cultural affairs at the university has a blunt answer 
it may take millions of lives he said of the conflict in 
which about 1 million people already have died but i am certain 
we will not collapse the system will survive 
he said the scaling down of political courses as more of an 
administrative arrangement to accommodate extra numbers of 
nonscience students in the programs 
khamrani a neurologist who graduated a few years behind najib 
spoke with scarcely concealed impatience of barefoot peasants 
steeped in islam whom the revolution was to liberate 
the west rudely interfered in our affairs he charged but 
khamrani added that he and his fellow revolutionaries made some 
mistakes too trying to change things too fast in a feudal 
agrarian and backward society 
despite rebels operating within a few miles of the city and the 
soviets on their way out he appeared not to contemplate possible 
death or jail for being a high profile party member 
the soviets will help us he said from his seat beneath a 
portrait of najib they wont leave us alone

dave roberts has trouble sleeping at 
night he dreams he is back in vietnam more than 20 years ago going 
down a dark river on a navy patrol boat trying to ambush viet cong 
soldiers 
he is 19 years old and scared having been wounded once already 
startled he awakens in his bedroom in tacoma wash 
roberts now 40 and seven other veterans from the seattletacoma 
area are returning to vietnam to revisit their bases and relive 
their war days of two decades ago as treatment for posttraumatic 
stress disorder which includes sleeplessness and restlessness 
i want to come to peace with my mind the country and the 
people and put all that behind me because the wars over roberts 
said friday during a stopover in bangkok en route to hanoi on the 
first leg of the groups twoweek tour i want to get on with a 
lot of things in my life 
another veteran bob swanson 39 a marine who helped build us 
fire bases wants to rid himself of guilt 
theres apologies i feel i need to make to the people said 
swanson there were civilians who were caught in our fire and 
ive had guilt feelings about that the other thing is to try to 
leave the warrior part of me in vietnam where it belongs it doesnt 
fit in the united states 
accompanying the veterans are two therapists ray scurfield a 
vietnam veteran himself and april gerlock and a film crew that 
will make a documentary that could be used in therapy for other 
veterans 
the veterans will undergo therapy during the trip and for two 
months after they return home they had been required to attend 
group therapy sessions once a week for the last five months in 
preparation for their return to vietnam 
basically were utilizing sort of an extension of a very 
accepted therapeutic practice in working with trauma survivors 
said scurfield director of the ptsd program at the american lake 
veterans hospital near tacoma that is direct therapeutic exposure 
to the trauma 
by coming over here our assumption is it will trigger 
repressed memories and feelings that they they need to get out 
consciously and talk about he said in doing that it appears 
they come to some kind of a peace 
scurfield said many veterans picture vietnam today as it was 20 
years ago 
by going now he said they have to substitute the reality 
of vietnam today its not the way it was 20 years ago thats a 
very important message for many veterans 
the veterans will see a new landscape devoid of us artillery 
and air bases covered over by red dirt with few reminders of the 
more than half a million american troops who served there

us district judge gerhard gesell asserted his 
authority to compel testimony from president bush or former 
president reagan and plans to rule monday on whether to throw out 
subpoenas for the two in the trial of fired white house aide oliver 
north 
the trial of north in the irancontra case was still scheduled to 
begin tuesday after an interagency task force of intelligence 
experts concluded that classified documents to be presented in the 
case dont pose a serious national security risk 
i guess were ready to go gesell told lawyers for both sides 
friday ill see all of you at 930 tuesday morning 
at a hearing gesell said that judicial authority to force bush 
or reagan to testify is indisputable 
as far as the power of the court to require testimony of 
reagan or bush is concerned i do not think there is any 
question he said the court has the power 
justice department official stephen saltzberg said that norths 
subpoenas should be quashed because the former national security 
council aide had not specified how bushs and reagans testimony 
would be relevant at trial 
gesell said he envisioned having the reagan subpoena remain in 
force with reagan on call but under no obligation to appear 
immediately and the government would be heard again before any 
order for him to appear 
larry simms one of reagans lawyers was in the courtroom for 
the hearing former justice department official theodore olson is 
the lead attorney representing the former president 
north also is seeking presidential documents including reagans 
diary john keker the lawyer who will prosecute north said that 
the white house counsel a year ago had prepared typed excerpts from 
the diary lawyers from the office of independent counsel lawrence 
walsh for whom keker works reviewed the excerpts but did not get 
copies of them said keker 
gesell delayed a ruling on the documents subpoena saltzberg is 
to contact reagans lawyers and make arrangements to have those 
diary segments made available to norths lawyers as well 
meanwhile an administration official said secrecy concerns would 
not block norths trial 
the interagency group of intelligence experts had identified some 
documents that might pose problems if gesell allowed their 
disclosure in open court by norths lawyers 
however much would depend on gesells rulings from the bench 
during the trial on the relevancy and admissibility of the 
documents said the administration official speaking on condition 
of anonymity and he said government secrecy experts familiar with 
the documents did not expect the sensitive material to be admitted 
because it didnt appear relevant to the case 
the official said administration officials planned to monitor the 
trial closely in the event there was an attempt by norths lawyers 
to introduce into evidence documents that would compromise national 
security 
another government source close to the matter also speaking on 
condition of anonymity said that one agency he declined to identify 
had problems with some of the classified information in the case 
but that the other agencies represented on the intelligence task 
force had refused to go along with the objections 
north is accused of concealing from congress and from former 
attorney general edwin meese iii his efforts on behalf of the 
nicaraguan contras and of covering up the nscs role in diverting 
money from the iran arms sales to the contras 
north also is accused of illegally accepting a 13800 security 
system at his home from codefendant richard secord converting to 
his own use at least 4300 in travelers checks from contra leader 
adolfo calero and conspiring to defraud the treasury of tax revenue 
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the contras

theres good news for women rich enough to afford 
the haute couture clothes shown by 20 high fashion designers in 
paris this week after a few seasons of extravagance the look is 
pretty and wearable 
the mood was strictly feminine in showings dominated by tender 
wispy chiffons and silks bias cuts bodyhugging sheaths and 
bustiers oversized pants and plenty of pleats evening wear was 
regal with generous use of embroidery lace and jewels and gold and 
silver applique 
it was adieu to oversized shoulders miniskirts and party poufs 
the lines are fluid and graceful with fluttering chiffons and soft 
crepes seen for both daytime and evening wear 
hems for the most part skimmed the knee although chanel opted 
for the midcalf length worn under long tunic jackets reminiscent of 
the 1930s 
dresses cost anywhere from 10000 and up and set trends for the 
fashion industry worldwide 
for some designers like givenchy it was the year of the dress 
but pants lovers will find some in almost every collection yves 
saintlaurents showed plenty of his signature trousers cut to 
perfection stopping above the ankle and per spook excelled at 
easytowear pajamas pants that covered the shoe 
for the cocktail hour look for guy laroches simple black sheath 
that plunges to the waist in the back and circled by gentle 
whitetipped ruffling 
laroche was this years winner of the golden thimble award for 
the most beautiful collection and he earned it with classy designs 
in colors that exploded on the runway sunbursts of yellow juicy 
reds and bright oranges melting into gentle pastels in the palest of 
blue green and pink 
saintlaurent too did wonders with the basics slitting skirts 
from hem to waist and revealing lots of leg suit jackets necklines 
dipped dramatically and his ultrasheer chiffon blouses worn with 
skirts bared all

french haute couture ruffling feathers in rome things only got 
worse when his business partner giancarlo giametti defended the 
decision saying valentino couldnt afford to show for downandout 
women and secondrate actresses 
valentino showed the same clothes as he did in rome and they 
were a hit with the french couture crowd christian lacroix 
abandoned the extravagance of his previous collections and came up 
with feminine design in clouds of pastel he draped reams of chiffon 
in flowing pantskirts embroidered and bejeweled raw silk he used 
lace relentlessly and gathered organza into sumptuous mountains 
lacroixs palette was full of sandy beiges recalling desert 
exoticism a replacement of his previous provencal look mixing 
melon and pistachio pastels poppy reds persian blue black white 
and navy 
unlike givenchy laroche and saintlaurent who played up the 
waist with drapery belts and buttons galore lacroix minimized it 
with trapezium and triangular shapes 
torrente maintained parisian chic by day with polka dot pastel 
dresses kick pleats sometimes topped with a bow or tiered dresses 
and always widebrimmed hats for afterdark there were draped 
chiffon and crepe held at the shoulder or waist with jewels or a 
bow 
hanae mori was another toast to femininity her floorlength 
yellow draped sheath was set off by a line of ruffles running from 
shoulder to toe 
for evening wear christian dior went to the sari using feathery 
light fabrics like crepe georgette or shantung silk crepe in a 
diagonal movement from waist to the opposite shoulder and indian 
style around the back to the hand 
pierre cardin made the mini even smaller than before then 
covered it up almost 
nini ricci not known as a trendsetter produced a large 
collection of simple but beautiful clothes for all times of day 
there were wide soft pants pleated and swirling skirts and 
cinched waists creating a kind of nostalgic girlish prettiness

the pentagon says no purpose would be served by 
declassifying files on americans missing in action in the vietnam 
war as a veterans advocacy group is seeking 
the national steering committee for american war veterans 
chaired by ted sampley of kinston nc said in a letter to 
president bush use your powers as president to help us liberate 
the truth mr president you cannot just wish that the issues 
of the vietnam war will go away 
sampley said the request to bush was partly a response to a 
report from the state and defense departments just before the reagan 
administration left office that us agencies have yet to find 
conclusive evidence of the existence of live prisoners 
but army lt col keith schneider chief pentagon spokesman on 
issues affecting the missing said in response to sampleys request 
i dont feel a proposal like youre talking about will do anything 
to enhance these ongoing efforts for the fullest accounting of 
what happened to us servicemen 
its quite obvious that declassification would jeopardize 
intelligence sources and collection techniques schneider said and 
your sources quickly begin to disappear when that happens 
information bearing on individuals in the files has been shared 
with families without revealing sources and techniques he said 
meanwhile in another development bob dumas of canterbury 
conn speaking for the korean war veterans association said a 
delegation from that group would meet north korean officials in new 
york seeking an invitation to visit north korea for discussions on 
returning the remains of us soldiers killed there 
the pentagon still lists 2383 americans as missing or 
unaccounted for in southeast asia or nearby waters dumas said 
remains of probably several hundred americans were in north 
korea as a result of the 19501953 korean war 
on monday the vietnamese government turned over remains believed 
to be those of 23 americans killed there 
sampley said his groups letter was in response to the 
presidents inaugural address and bushs references to a new 
breeze blowing 
sampleys group has long maintained that americans are in 
captivity in southeast asia last fall it sponsored an incursion 
into laos by two americans jim kopp and donna long to spread word 
of a 24 million reward being offered by 21 members of congress for 
anyone who freed an american 
the two were caught on their first day and held for 41 days 
before being released

labor unions represented a slightly smaller 
share of the nations work force in 1988 even though the total 
number of union members increased the government reports 
the labor department reported friday that the number of americans 
belonging to labor unions rose by 100000 to 17 million last year 
but the size of the overall work force increased even faster 
union members continued last year to earn more than nonunion 
workers fulltime workers who were union members had median weekly 
earnings of 480 compared with 356 for those who were not union 
members the department reported 
the department said 168 percent of the 101 million wage and 
salary employees in the united states last year were union members 
down from 17 percent in 1987 and 18 percent in 1985 
the 100000 new union members came from the ranks of black 
workers the labor department said 
in fact there were slight decreases in the number of whites and 
hispanics belonging to unions last year membership among black 
workers rose from 244 million in 1987 to 255 million last year 
the labor department said 
the membership gain although slight provided some solace to 
union officials who have dedicated many of their efforts in recent 
years to trying to reverse declining membership 
we hope we have bottomed out but we dont know yet for sure 
said rex hardesty a spokesman for the aflcio 
there were 107 union members in private industry last year and 
63 million government workers in unions

used to promote everything from pantyhose to taxis 
his company install ad systems has lined up space in the 
restrooms of a theater a tavern restaurants and three tourbus 
companies he said 
the businesses will recieve a cut of rons revenues for 
installing up to 10 framed 6by6inch ads on the back of each 
stall door advertisers will pay about 180 per month for a 
fivestall display with a captive audience guaranteed

it was too cold for driving too cold 
for flying too cold for just about everything it was so cold with 
wind chill readings of up to 115 degrees below zero that even dog 
sled races were canceled 
and that isnt just an alaskan tall tale 
in an arctic state where people take cold weather for granted 
where subzero temperatures are about as common as frost in the lower 
48 a sudden plunge into brutally bitter cold has grabbed everyones 
attention 
it was 75 degrees below zero friday in mcgrath about 150 miles 
west of mount mckinley it was 43 below in fairbanks where 
electricity demand hit an alltime high far to the south in 
anchorage the states largest city the high friday was 15 below 
were not declaring an emergency yet gov steve cowper said 
with a stiff upper lip as alaskans wondered whether the temperatures 
would break the record of 80 below zero set in 1971 at prospect 
creek 
however in a brief radio message the governor gave instructions 
on how to call for emergency help and he acknowledged theres 
no end in sight apparently 
the national weather service held out a bit more hope saying 
temperatures could rise by the middle of next week forecasters said 
they didnt know whether the cold air would have an effect on 
temperatures elsewhere in the united states 
the cold snap carrying wind chills of up to 115 below is being 
caused by the southerly flow of the jet stream which ordinarily 
carries storms that bring relatively warm air into alaska the 
forecasters said 
by contrast it remained unusually warm through the middle and 
eastern sections of the nation friday with highs soaring into the 
60s as far north as south dakota records were set in many cities 
including rapid city sd with a high of 63 and apalachicola 
fla where it was 77 
the alaskan cold forced school closures in some towns and people 
in some kodiac island communities replenished their household 
heating fuel with supplies from wellstocked schools 
in a state that relies heavily on air travel because of its size 
the cold forced the cancellation of some flights some rural grocery 
stores reported dwindling supplies 
the adjutant general of the alaska national guard maj gen john 
schaeffer said the guard would have difficulty making emergency 
assistance flights because of the cold however he said planes 
might be able to drop emergency supplies into settlements if 
necessary 
schaeffer said most rural alaskans stocked up on essentials 
before the winter and only the uninitiated were likely to get 
caught short 
the national guards dieselpowered trucks were among the few 
vehicles still operating in mcgrath where the morning temperature 
of minus 75 warmed to minus 59 by 11 am friday 
a mcgrath radio station featured an interview with a man who was 
able to keep his datsun pickup running the hardy driver described 
his technique which involved the use of two heaters including one 
that he moved back and forth under the truck 
even the kuskokwim 300 sled dog race which runs between bethel 
and aniak had to be postponed because of the cold 
with temperatures of minus 45 in bethel and considerably lower 
elsewhere along the route organizers decided to keep the 20 mushers 
inside until the temperature rose to at least 25 below

president bush concluded what he called a 
harmonious first week in the white house by urging caution in 
dealing with the soviets and giving his support to a 50 percent pay 
raise for congress 
holding his first news conference as president on friday bush 
displayed ease and confidence in fielding reporters questions in a 
session that ranged in topics from abortion to foreign relations 
bush today was meeting with former secretary of state henry 
kissinger for a briefing on his recent trip to the soviet union 
kissinger met with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and delivered 
personal greetings from bush 
tonight bushs schedule includes an appearance at the annual 
dinner of the allmale alfalfa club in washington the group each 
year hosts a humorous dinner with remarks by prominent politicians 
and business leaders 
despite the clubs allmale membership bush will follow the 
tradition of past presidents and attend said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the decision was criticized by ann lewis a womens activist and 
prominent democratic political consultant who cited the club as an 
example of how women are excluded from opportunities to make 
business connections 
she also gave a copy of a rule in the federal personnel manual 
that states federal personnel acting in their official capacities 
shall not participate in any conference or meetings held in 
facilities in which discrimination is practiced on the basis of sex 
religion or national origin as well as race 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas is the outgoing president of the 
club 
in his news conference friday bush deflected questions about 
such controversies as a possible fee on deposits at banks and thrift 
institutions and the abortion views of dr louis sullivan his 
nominee for secretary of health and human services 
i think its been a wonderfully harmonious week bush said 
and these are just little ripples on the surface of an otherwise 
calm pond 
he downplayed the treasury department plan on the savings account 
fee saying that was an option not a proposal 
bush said the administration was reassessing all aspects of 
ussoviet relations he said he doesnt think the soviets consider 
that as footdragging im confident they dont 
asked if he felt there still was a cold war between moscow 
and washington bush said he wanted to avoid the phrase 
if someone says cold war to me that doesnt properly give 
credit to the advances that have taken place in this relationship 
the president said but if its used in the context of are we 
still unsure of in our predictions on soviet intentions id have 
to say yes we should be cautious 
during his campaign bush declared the cold war is not over 
on friday bush said he wanted to take the offensive on foreign 
policy rather than merely react to moves by the soviets adding 
but prudence is the order of the day 
on other topics bush 
said of the pay raise that would bring salaries for members of 
congress to 135000 a year a raise is overdue theres no 
question about that 
said iran can have an influence in winning the release of 
the american hostages in lebanon even though it does not actually 
hold them he recalled a period of time when we had excellent 
relations with iran and i dont want to think that the status quo 
has to go on forever 
discussed this weeks supreme court decision that sharply 
restricted the ability of state and local governments to reserve a 
fixed percentage of contracts for minority businesses without proof 
of past discrimination bush said i will not read into that a 
mandate to me to stop trying on equal employment and on affirmative 
action generally he said 
asked how long his campaign promise against any new taxes would 
last said id like it to be a fouryear pledge

doctors and nurses scurry to make their 
rounds and patients in wheelchairs and gurneys fill the halls it 
looks like an ordinary hospital but the patients are convicted 
felons among them swindlers and spies 
the federal medical center could just as easily be a college 
campus with its open spaces treelined walkways and outdoor 
recreational facility that includes a basketball court ice rink and 
jogging path the combined prison and hospital moved onto the 
grounds of a former state hospital that closed in 1982 
we want the appearance to be reasonably attractive said 
warden joseph bogan we think it would be unproductive and unwise 
to tear down the trees remove the grass and put in concrete 
the tranquil scene has its limits the 55acre center is 
surrounded by a double razorwire fence patrol trucks carrying 
armed guards circle the complex and computerized sensing devices 
detect movement along the perimeter 
but unlike most federal prisons the federal medical center 
concentrates security on the perimeter and allows inmates relative 
freedom inside the fences there are no bars on the windows of the 
lowtomediumsecurity facility and inmates do not need passes to 
move about the campus 
the prison located in this southeastern minnesota town of 60000 
thats home to the mayo clinic admits federal convicts who need 
medical or psychiatric care the only similar institution the 
medical center for federal prisoners at springfield mo is a 
highsecurity facility 
in rochester guards within the perimeter do not carry weapons 
inmates are aware of the prisons policy that it will not give in to 
the demands of prisoners in the event of a hostage situation john 
chreno executive assistant to the warden said recently no one has 
tried to escape since the first prisoners arrived in october 1984 
he said 
you wouldnt even know youre in prison here said michael 
rosenow who is serving a threeyear sentence for tax evasion 
rosenow works in the prisons business office during the day and 
takes classes at night 
frederick coffey who is serving time for a fraud conviction 
described the atmosphere as much more relaxed than other prisons 
my idea of being incarcerated was the bar on the windows 
scene but were mostly free to move around here he said 
bogan defended the prison against criticism that it coddles 
criminals 
most of our inmates will be back among us eventually and its 
in societys best interests not to brutalize them he said 
the hospital which employs eight fulltime physicians 57 nurses 
and 72 other medical personnel can treat most illnesses except 
those requiring kidney dialysis chreno said the prisoners often go 
to the nearby mayo clinic for treatment and clinic doctors come to 
the prison for consulting work or to perform surgery 
patients come here for everything from severe mental disorders 
to personality disorders to terminal cancer to orthopedic work 
chreno said we represent a cross section of the illnesses of 
society theres nothing in society thats not represented by some 
offender 
about half of the prisons approximately 580 patients work in the 
kitchen on the grounds crew or in a factory which makes cables for 
the government 
about 120 inmates are there for medical reasons about 75 for 
psychiatric treatment and others for chemical dependency 
criminals who have spent time at rochester include fbi agent 
richard miller who was sentenced in january 1986 to life in prison 
for spying for the soviet union lee alexander the former mayor of 
syracuse ny sentenced to 10 years for running an 
extortionkickback scheme and anne pollard who is serving a 
fiveyear term for helping her husband sell documents to israel 
the prison drew opposition when the plans for it were announced 
gertrude tyce who led the fight said she still believes prisons 
dont belong in neighborhoods 
but its here now and were not going to sit and crab about it 
forever she said

massachusetts gov michael dukakis has joined the 
growing ranks of prosecutors and political leaders calling for the 
resignation of us attorney frank l mcnamara who is under fire 
for a variety of alleged improprieties 
the situation has been an embarrassment for months and months 
and months dukakis said friday i dont think this appointment 
should ever have been made 
twentyeight of the 39 federal prosecutors in massachussetts 
called for the removal or resignation of mcnamara who is their 
boss saying his presence is jeopardizing the credibility of their 
office 
criticism of mcnamara a 41yearold republican appointed by 
president reagan in 1987 has been growing since november when the 
justice department said it could find no basis for his allegations 
that his predecessor william f weld smoked marijuana at a party 
shortly thereafter mcnamara admitted that he had smoked 
marijuana as recently as four years ago more recently he has been 
criticized for pressing investigations that were allegedly aimed at 
discrediting democrats including dukakis 
mcnamara declined comment friday asked how he could continue his 
duties under the circumstances he replied you have to address 
that question to somebody else because i dont have any comment 
prosecutors in the boston and springfield offices under 
mcnamaras command sent a letter friday to us attorney general 
richard thornburgh urging him to fire the embattled chief prosecutor 
because mr mcnamara will neither resign nor step aside 
temporarily the credibility and operations of this office will 
continue to be damaged perhaps irretrievably unless he is 
removed the letter said 
rep barney frank dmass said if no action is forthcoming from 
the justice department then i think congressional hearings will 
be necessary

several armed civilians who took 
over an suburban army base escaped a military counterattack and may 
be preparing another assault argentinas attorney general says 
we know that in this attack more people participated than were 
killed or arrested andres dalessio told a news conference friday 
dalessio said a former leader of the nowdefunct peoples 
revolutionary army enrique gorriaran merlo took part in the 
attack but offered no proof of his involvement 
his participation is presumed taking into account his former 
guerrilla activity his training and the connection he had in recent 
times with leftist groups dalessio said 
the government says 60 leftist guerrillas staged the assault the 
armed civilians battled soldiers for 27 hours and 38 people died 
including 28 guerrillas eighteen of the attackers were captured 
dalessio said police have interrogated the survivors and jailed 
two more people he said arrest warrants have been issued for five 
others including gorriaran merlo he said more violence was 
possible 
an armed group that suffers a public defeat of this size in 
general sees it as necessary to do something to demonstrate its 
still in condition to keep operating he said 
the peoples revolutionary army clashed openly with argentinas 
army in the 1970s in an attempt to overthrow the government the 
guerrilla army was thought to be virtually decimated it had 
formally disbanded in 1980 
gorriaran merlo fled to nicaragua according to police reports 
and his own admission in a published interview he participated in 
the 1980 bazooka attack on a street in asuncion paraguay that 
killed deposed nicaraguan dictator anastasio somoza

a city councilmans campaign to buy back 
semiautomatic assault rifles has taken a curious turn with one 
group of people turning in weapons shortly after buying them at gun 
stores 
the five people who turned in seven assault rifles intend to 
donate the 2100 they received to families of the victims in the 
stockton schoolyard shooting a spokesman for the group said friday 
we do not want to profiteer or benefit from their tragedy 
said jeff fox spokesman for a group of van nuys real estate office 
workers 
fox 37 said the five parents were shocked by the jan 17 
shooting that killed five children and wounded 30 others including 
a teacher at cleveland elementary school in stockton in northern 
california 
the killer patrick purdy used a semiautomatic ak47 assault 
rifle to shoot the pupils and then used a pistol to kill himself 
the incident has focused attention on the destructive capabilities 
of the easily purchased weapons 
city councilman nate holden who originated the buyback idea 
said a tally friday evening showed that 42 ak47s and two uzi 
machine pistols had been turned in 
holden who will pay the value of the weapon up to 300 said he 
paid a total of 984188 for the weapons 
the los angeles police department has supported the campaign 
against the military style rifles favored by street gangs and has 
helped publicize procedures for safely bringing the weapons to its 
stations 
people with police receipts showing they had returned a gun were 
paid from a 50000 political committee fund that holden a mayoral 
candidate set aside tuesday 
those who turned in weapons had a chance to pick up an additional 
300 by taking a copy of the police receipt to radio station kiisfm 
in hollywood from thursday morning through friday morning 
lynn andersonpowell kiis president and general manager said 
she didnt care if people made money off the giveaway 
our purpose was to decrease the number of guns on the street 
we feel thats that many fewer lives that may be needlessly 
taken in violence she said 
one woman bought 13 ak47s and turned them in thursday not for 
the 300 but to get them off the shelf said holden 
holden said the unidentified woman paid a total of 519188 for 
the 13 highpowered weapons and didnt make a profit by turning 
them in to authorities 
she was paid 3900 or 300 per rifle by kiisfm and holden 
said his office reimbursed her for the remaining amount 
meanwhile rep howard l berman dcalif introduced 
legislation in congress on friday to outlaw the possession of 
semiautomatic firearms 
bermans bill would require civilian owners of fastfiring 
weapons to turn them over to a law enforcement officer within 30 
days after the bill takes effect violators would face 5000 fines 
and fiveyear prison terms 
the national rifle association called bermans plan a stupid 
piece of legislation and said it would mount a strong lobbying 
campaign to defeat the bill

cubans attending an international conference on the 
1962 missile crisis criticized the conduct of their soviet allies in 
the incident saying the kremlin shut them out of some decisions a 
participant said 
the moscow conference which opened friday is the first on the 
topic to bring together representatives of the united states soviet 
union and cuba 
each country maintains its own version of what happened in 
october 1962 when the soviets deployed nuclear missiles in cuba and 
the united states imposed a quarantine on the island and demanded 
and obtained the removal of the missiles 
representatives at the conference include former us defense 
secretary robert mcnamara and former soviet foreign minister andrei 
a gromyko 
at fridays session the soviets and americans clashed on whether 
war was imminent more than a quartercentury ago 
the american side cited conversations among themselves about 
whether theyd live to see days in the following week to back their 
contention that the threat of war was real said a participant 
on the soviet side gromyko said the soviets never at any time 
acted under the belief that war was a real possibility 
the proceedings were closed to reporters and the participant 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
during the session the cubans complained that the soviets did not 
consult them sufficiently during the crisis the participant said 
they also complained the united states should have used diplomatic 
channels to express its demand that the soviet missiles be withdrawn 
and to clarify american intentions 
georgy a arbatov head of the usacanada institute a kremlin 
think tank told the conference soviet premier nikita s khrushchev 
erred in shipping nuclear missiles to cuba because he hadnt 
anticipated the us reaction and that he humiliated his country 
the participant said 
other soviet officials at the session however praised 
khrushchev as a great statesman who succeeded in getting the 
americans to pledge not to invade cuba 
the discussions are organized by harvard universitys john f 
kennedy school of government 
at a conference sponsored by the kennedy school in 1987 
americans and soviets met to review the crisis but the meeting in 
moscow is the first to include cuban representatives led by jorge 
risquet a member of his communist partys governing politburo 
seated around an oval table topped with blue felt mcnamara and 
other us participants including mcgeorge bundy theodore 
sorenson and pierre salinger are exchanging thoughts with soviets 
including gromyko arbatov and anatoly f dobrynin the former 
soviet ambassador to washington 
president bush in a message read at the ceremony by jack 
matlock the us ambassador to moscow called the session the 
latest example of the new openness under president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
bush said international security would be helped by closer study 
of the cuban missile crisis this can only improve our mutual 
understanding of just the sort of episode we must avoid in the 
nuclear age he said 
in his own message of greetings gorbachev called on participants 
to think over and draw lessons from this event that brought the 
world to the brink of the nuclear precipice

began pulling a garbage bag over his head according to a statement 
by motel clerk monica stroud 
creswell suddenly realized he had forgotten to make eyeholes in 
the bag the clerk told police 
so he started pulling on the bag to try to put some holes in 
it milam said and then he asked for the money well she said 
she wasnt going to give him any money and he left

holdup when he was arrested minutes later milam said authorities

wall street cheered a government report that indicated the 
nations economy lost some of its steam in the fourth quarter of 
1988 easing fears that the pace of economic growth could fuel 
inflation 
the commerce department reported friday that the nations gross 
national product slowed to 20 percent in the fourth quarter the 
figure was below wall streets expectations and provided fresh 
evidence that the economy was slowing to a sustainable pace 
the report also said the economy grew a healthy 38 percent for 
all of 1988 
bond traders welcomed the fourthquarter growth figure by bidding 
up prices of longterm government bonds thereby pushing interest 
rates lower which provided fresh momentum for wall streets 
ongoing rally 
brokers said a rise in the dollar in foreignexchange trading 
friday also helped stir investors enthusiasm for stocks 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbed 3179 
points to 232286 bringing its gain for the week to 8750 points 
the government said the 1988 gnp figure benefited from a 
narrowing of the trade deficit and a large increase in business 
investment 
the increase came even though growth slowed sharply in the final 
three months of the year to the slowest quarterly performance in two 
years 
commenting on the gnp report the bush administration said the 
fourthquarter slowdown was not a warning that the sixyear record 
peacetime economic recovery was in endangered and should not 
overshadow the stellar performance of the economy for all of 1988 
the gnp report also indicated inflation picked up during the 
year with a price index tied to the gnp rising by 42 percent the 
fastest increase since a 62 percent rise in 1982 
analysts said the federal reserve likely will consider the 
inflation level too high and keep up its pressure on interest rates 
but bush on friday played down any differences between the 
administration and federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
he is more concerned about inflation pressures than i am right 
now bush said at a news conference it seems to me there is an 
area of difference but generally speaking i think we are fairly 
close together

singer michael jackson has apparently forsaken 
the concert stage at age 30 giving what was billed as his last 
performance 
jackson appearing an hour late after being mobbed backstage by 
celebrity wellwishers took the stage friday night amid a vapor 
mist and the deafening roar of a capacity crowd at the los angeles 
sports arena 
since this is the last concert there was a big mob scene 
backstage publicist lee solters said early today a lot of 
people were wishing him well 
dozens of stretch limousines were on hand carrying stars such as 
actors elizabeth taylor jane fonda raquel welch and michael landon 
and singers phil collins dionne warwick tiffany and members of the 
heavy metal group motley crue 
many fans said they had waited weeks to see jackson who canceled 
december shows in los angeles because of strained vocal cords 
tickets for the farewell show were fetching prices well beyond their 
face value 
sylvia smith 35 who attended the concert with her 9yearold 
daughter barika said she was offered 100 for her 2750 loge seat 
but turned it down 
it was tempting since i couldve let barika go in with her aunt 
and uncle ms smith said but she said no mommy you gotta 
go and i figured if its michaels last concert i may as well be 
part of history 
although fridays show was billed as a farewell performance 
jacksons manager backed off from saying the reclusive performer 
would never appear in concert again 
im not saying hes not going to perform live again but i 
dont think well ever go out on tour like this frank dileo said 
the show marked the end of jacksons bad tour a grueling 
16month effort that took him around the world 
jackson celebrated as widely for his eccentricities as for his 
songs vocals and choreography intends to keep recording and is 
considering film roles solters said 
jackson who hasnt granted an interview since 1984 is said to 
be interested in movies writing producing and directing 
taking the stage accompanied by bodyguards jackson sang and 
danced his way through a number of his hits friday night backed by 
dancers dressed as punk rockers monsters and street gang members 
he used his signature moonwalk movements to glide across 
stage singing such songs as starting something the way you 
make me feel and man in the mirror as the audience howled and 
stomped in approval

the mouse game as familiar to maine 
county fairgoers as ferris wheels and cotton candy is destined to 
become a midway memory 
fair officials attending the annual meeting of the maine 
association of agricultural fairs learned friday that the mouse game 
had been declared illegal just like the cow chip casino 
in the mouse game players buy numbered tickets in hopes that a 
mouse when released will run down a correspondingly numbered hole 
on the rim of a spinning table 
the director of the state animal welfare board clyde f leclair 
said any game of chance in which an animal is used to determine the 
outcome is prohibited by statute horse racing is regulated by a 
separate set of laws 
the cow chip contest in which a cow is turned loose in a 
fencedin area lined with numbered squares became illegal in late 
september when state police shut down a contest at the cumberland 
fair the proceeds were to help buy playground equipment at a local 
school 
the head of the licensing division sgt bruce refnell confirmed 
that until the cumberland fair incident he was unaware of the state 
humane law prohibiting the use of animals 
that got us thinking about the mice used at the fairs and they 
fall under the same rule refnell said 
billy burr of billy burrs funorama said his midways did not 
use the mouse game last year 
in fact maine was the only state that i know of that still 
allowed the game burr said friday its another tradition lost 
but it wont affect me at all

the two german war criminals 
pardoned and returned to west germany by the netherlands had 
indirect responsibility for sending anne frank to her death a 
world war ii historian said today 
but there is no direct link between the dutch jewish girl who 
died in the bergenbelsen concentration camp and the two elderly 
germans freed from prison friday said loe de jong considered the 
nations foremost authority on world war ii 
franz fischer 87 and 79yearold ferdinand aus der fuenten were 
deported to west germany after spending 43 years in a dutch prison 
the two were highranking nazi officials responsible for sending 
thousands of dutch jews to their deaths during world war ii 
only 6000 of the netherlands 150000 jews survived nazi 
persecution 
the group that arrested the frank family in amsterdam 
operated under the command of aus der fuenten and aus der fuenten 
worked under the instructions of fischer de jong told the 
associated press it would be correct to say they had indirect 
responsibility for anne franks fate 
de jong is the author of the 14volume history of the kingdom 
of the netherlands in world war ii a governmentcommissioned 
study 
anne frank and her family were arrested by a german police unit 
known as the green police in august 1944 and were first deported to 
the auschwitz death camp in naziheld poland 
anne later was moved to the bergenbelsen concentration camp in 
germany where she died of pneumonia in 1945 at age 15 
from june 1942 until her arrest anne wrote her diary as the 
franks hid in a secret section of an amsterdam canal house closed 
off from the rest of the building by a bookshelf 
the book perhaps the most famous personal document to come out 
of the holocaust was published in 1947 and was turned into a play 
and movie 
fischer ran the haguebased jewish section of the nazi security 
service ss in that capacity he gave guidelines about which 
jews should be rounded up de jong said 
aus der fuenten an ss administrator who ran what was cynically 
called the central directorate for jewish emigration oversaw the 
deportations of thousands of jews from amsterdam rotterdam and the 
hague 
fischer and aus der fuenten were sentenced to death in 1950 but 
their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment a year later 
they were the worlds only war criminals who had been jailed 
since world war ii according to the government which said keeping 
them here any longer would violate the principle of equality before 
the law 
the netherlands has pardoned and freed 107 other war criminals 
who had been sentenced to death

the house of commons scuttled legislation intended 
to protect individuals from intrusive newspaper reporting when the 
bills supporters failed to muster enough support to force a vote 
even some legislators whose private lives had become grist for 
londons racier dailies spoke against the bill on friday and the 
government said remedies already existed 
the bills sponsor conservative john browne said preserving 
privacy is in the public interest we hope this bill will put water 
in the moat of everyones castle 
after five hours of debate friday the bill fell one short of the 
necessary 100 votes to close debate and vote on whether it should 
move to the next parliamentary phase called a second reading the 
house of commons has 650 members 
the legislation would have created a statutory right of privacy 
and permitted suits for breaches it would have placed the burden on 
the newspaper to show that its disclosures were for the public 
benefit 
george galloway a labor party member said he and his family had 
been subjected to what he called the rampaging rat packs of the 
tabloid press following his admission in 1987 that he had had an 
extramarital affair but he still opposed the measure 
timothy renton minister of state in the home office told 
legislators there was growing resentment at the way some of the 
tabloid press blatantly exposes private lives 
however renton said the bill in question could prove a clumsy 
instrument 
robin corbett a labor member who once worked for the tabloid 
daily mirror denounced the governments apparent neutrality on the 
issue 
there is no doubt at all that the excesses of the sewer sun and 
other tabloids have reached such proportions in the quest for 
sensation and sleaze that action must be now taken corbett said 
britains tabloids far outsell such respected newspapers as the 
daily telegraph or the times the sun with circulation of 42 
million is read by a quarter of all adults in britain according to 
readership surveys made in 1986 the tabloid daily mirror reached 20 
percent of adults while the telegraph reached 6 percent and the 
times 2 percent

singapore adopted a change in the service clubs constitution and

admit women canadian rotaries followed last november after clubs in 
montreal argued that exclusion of women violated the countrys laws 
nearly 11000 of the 420000 rotarians in canada and the united 
states are women 
but until this week international documents of the club still 
called it an organization for adult male persons mim neal a

voted 328117 to change the constitution and bylaws the new 
membership provisions will be sent to all clubs

a buoyant lech walesa said today he was 
satisfied with the governments offer to legalize solidarity and 
that the countrys political outlook had changed 
speaking at a news conference after talks with the government 
friday walesa said the ruling communist party has provided 
political guarantees or political openness and i think its 
sufficient as a guarantee 
he also said upcoming talks between the government and 
opposition including solidarity should progress as quickly as 
possible because polands problems are urgent 
lech walesa is really scared he said the situation in the 
country is very difficult 
but there are terribly difficult and complicated problems and 
they cant be solved that quickly he added 
the government and solidarity leaders announced friday in a joint 
communique that talks on relegalization of the banned solidarity 
trade movement and on political and economic reform would begin feb 
6 according to the state news agency pap 
the statement also said fridays session discussed the problems 
of trade union pluralism including solidarity 
i am satisfied and very tired walesa had told reporters 
after negotiating friday for more than 11 hours to set the date for 
the broader talks i made hours of overtime 
the joint statement said a preliminary decision had been made to 
set up three working teams for economic and social policy political 
reforms and union pluralism 
participants also agreed to set up groups on agriculture mining 
legal and court reform selfgovernment mass media and youth the 
communique said 
fridays talks were held in a secluded government house in the 
woods in magdalenka a warsaw suburb 
the government first proposed the talks on polands future during 
a wave of strikes in august the countrys worst labor unrest since 
the government imposed martial law in december 1981 and crushed 
solidarity the soviet blocs only independent trade union movement 
the talks appear to be part of a government effort to bring the 
opposition into the battle to reverse the economic decline that has 
left poland with chronic shortages a daunting foreign debt and a 
dispirited generation of young people 
walesa was accompanied to the negotiations by a group of seven 
union activists and advisers and three representatives of the 
church 
others with walesa included gdansk bishop tadeusz goclowski 
zbigniew bujak the former underground solidarity leader and 
mieczyslaw gil chairman of solidarity at the nowa huta steel mill 
in krakow 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak politburo member 
stanislaw ciosek and janusz reykowski head of stateradio and 
television were among the representatives of the authorities pap 
said 
walesa has said he would not hold talks on polands future until 
the authorities made a political decision to make the union legal 
in a dramatic reversal of policy last week the communist party 
central committee approved an offer to allow more than one legal 
trade union to exist and opposition participation in the government 
solidarity founded in 1980 was crushed in a december 1981 
military crackdown and banned the next year

defense minister rupert scholz told 
nato defense specialists he supports plans to modernize shortrange 
nuclear missiles in europe 
however critics at the nato session immediately fired back that 
his speech was too vague in outlining west germanys position on a 
pentagon call for extending the range of such missiles 
us sen warren rudman rnh told scholz that it appeared 
you kind of want to have it both ways 
in his speech to nato defense experts meeting in munich scholz 
laid out a middle ground between the pentagon proposals and west 
german public opinion which is strongly against such changes 
scholz said only that north atlantic treaty organization missiles 
must be kept modern he gave no details 
the first day of the annual weekend strategy conference produced 
heated debate over various issues facing the alliances 16 members 
when scholz mentioned west germanys resistance to picking up 
more of natos expenses us participants charged that europeans 
have not been pulling their financial weight 
us defense secretarydesignate john tower got a round of 
applause when he arrived at the conference but sat quietly through 
the sharp exchanges 
another major issue was how the west should respond to soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs disarmament overtures 
a 1983 nato decision to refit existing shortrange missiles to 
extend their range beyond the current limit of 300 miles is 
increasingly unpopular among europeans especially west germans 
many of them see the plan as an obstacle to further arms control 
reductions 
scholz echoed pentagon skepticism about the kremlins willingness 
to relinquish its military might but skirted direct mention of west 
germanys attitude toward missile modifications 
in the dispute over nato expenses rudman said that as much as 60 
percent of the us military budget goes for natorelated defense 
he said european members must accept additional alliance costs 
edward luttwak of georgetown university told the gathering that 
in the last 20 years other people have been living inside the 
house of strategic security without paying the rent 
scholz also drew fire from west german opposition social democrat 
karsten voigt who said the defense minister failed to take a clear 
stand on the issue of missile modifications 
you were really perfect when it comes to being vague said 
voigt who opposes the proposed modifications

george bush was a dynamo of action getting to 
work early staying late and saying there were no surprises to wipe 
the smile off his face on the other hand he didnt have to make 
any tough decisions in his first week as president 
no one is naive enough to assume that what we think has been a 
good two days will define the 1458 days between now and 
inauguration 1993 but it is i hope the kind of quality that 
could be expected white house chief of staff john sununu said in 
an early assessment 
it was a brisk firstweek pace 
bush delighted congressional leaders of both parties with a 
meeting that sparked talk of a honeymoon 
he called dozens of foreign leaders 
he scheduled trips over the next month to canada japan china 
and south korea 
he stressed ethics in government 
he met with the press three times 
he went jogging and turned up at the washington cathedral the 
state department and constitution hall 
while refusing to draw a comparison with the detached handsoff 
style of ronald reagan a white house official said one of the most 
interesting aspects of the first week was that bush demonstrated a 
curiosity about what was happening 
hes poked his head into several staff people to ask what 
theyre doing to see how projects are coming said the official 
who asked not to be identified by name most of the people on the 
staff by the end of the week had received a note of one kind or 
another from him that either told of a phone call he had made on a 
subject of their interest or asked about a project in their area or 
somehow identified he was involved in a project they were working 
on 
up before dawn the new president was in the oval office around 
715 am each day and stayed until after 6 pm most nights 
its been a good easy week bush said friday at a relaxed 
fastmoving news conference and i expect it will change 
dramatically in the days ahead 
suffering from a cold that left him hoarse bush said if it 
werent for the cold smile and enjoy it while you can because i 
can already sense you know looking forward to a little more 
little more confrontation out there 
the news conference provided a sharp contrast between the styles 
of bush and reagan for his infrequent meetings with reporters 
reagan studied briefing papers and sample questions for days and 
then held at least two dress rehearsals with his staff sometimes 
bush was among those in the audience to critique the answers 
at the actual news conferences reagan often seemed ill at ease 
and the sessions often turned out to have little news value 
bush a veterans of more than two decades of government service 
and a specialist on foreign policy matters did not need much 
preparation for his news conference aides said he was given a list 
of some of the questions that had come up in the daily briefings of 
press secretary marlin fitzwater but there were no practice 
sessions 
standing in the press room bush seemed confident and in high 
spirits calling on many reporters by name and interrupting the news 
conference at one point to turn the table on reporters and grill 
them about the practice of asking followup questions 
there were early tastes of trouble with a new controversy over 
the abortion views of dr louis sullivan his nominee for secretary 
of health and human services and an uproar over a treasury 
department proposal to rescue the savings and loan industry by 
charging a depositor fee bush brushed aside the flaps as little 
ripples on the surface of an otherwise calm pond 
the ripples are likely to get bigger soon 
by feb 9 the date of his address before a joint session of 
congress bush has to decide who wins and who loses in the battle 
for federal funds as he divides up a shrinking budget pie and 
struggles to cut the deficit 
privately white house officials are passing the word that there 
wont be enough money for bush to keep all his campaign promises for 
education and other programs for his kinder and gentler nation 
look i dont expect its going to be all sweetness and harmony 
and light bush said the minute we get those proposals up there

as soviet troops withdraw from afghanistan the

and anxiety mounts in this capital city here is a report from an ap

when night falls over this capital 
afghan soldiers shabbily dressed but armed with russianmade 
kalashnikov rifles stop automobiles at every city block 
their jerky movements betray their nervousness 
at the airport across the city an afghan army general sees off a

this is kabul 
as the last days slip away before the soviet army is due to leave 
afghanistan by feb 15 a 10year civil war rages on nobody knows 
what will happen next suspicion and fear are widespread and no one 
looks like a winner 
without the soviets the survival prospects of the promarxist 
regime of president najib are counted in months by most western 
diplomats in kabul 
the seven groups of moslem rebels whose commanders control great 
swaths of the countryside as warlords are divided among themselves 
hundreds of towns and villages are wrecked by soviet and afghan 
bombing raids an estimated 1 million people have been killed in the 
conflict and 5 million a third of the population have fled to 
pakistan and iran 
the soviet union whose costly military intervention began in 
1979 stands condemned by the west and many third world countries as 
an occupying superpower that met with gallant resistance from 
guerrilla fighters

on the drab icy streets of kabul the soviets look like wearied 
colonial administrators in the dying days of an empire as they 
distribute airlifted emergency rations from armored vehicles to cold 
and hungry crowds who throng handout points even though they say 
theyre delighted the red army is going 
soviet commanders keen to publicize the handouts and coy about 
the withdrawal and whether promises of continued military assistance 
to najib will include more bombing raids grumble openly about 
afghan inefficiency 
the local administration did not give out the orders in time 
for when they needed to get food supplies said maj gen lev 
serebrov no 2 in the soviet high command here and the traders are 
hoarding to raise prices 
still he acknowledges that moscows afghan adventure has gone 
wrong 
we came here with a very honorable task with open hearts 
we are leaving and we have a sense of not having accomplished our 
mission to the end he told western reporters 
the kabul mayor afghan army gen mohammad hakim claims the city 
has a threemonth stockpile of food and fuel to withstand any 
blockade by rebels now entrenched on the outskirts once the 
soviets go 
but western diplomats say reserves are virtually exhausted un 
aid officials warn that without more emergency supplies the capital 
of more than 2 million people half of them war refugees from the 
provinces faces disaster 
the west provides little more than token aid refusing to deal 
with najibs administration 
the soviets meanwhile appear unwilling to ditch najib or to 
take him off to moscow in the hope of forging a lastminute 
agreement on a coalition in which the rebel leaders would sit with 
at least some of the marxists

in the bazaars the money changers operate as openly as the rug 
traders a us dollar now fetches 230 afghans up from 180 a few

the small group of western journalists in kabul are gathered at 
the intercontinental hotel on a hillside overlooking the capital 
it is the sole hotel in the city with a telex and the only one left 
with central heating

the foreign ministry tries to keep a close watch on reporters 
assigning them guidesinterpreters with english ranging for the

the foreign ministry inundated with visa applications from 
journalists clamped down on issuing new visas in early january 
western diplomats suspect the move followed orders from the 
soviet high command seeking to pull troops out of the capital with 
the minimum of publicity the foreign ministry says it acted because 
it does not have enough interpreters known by reporters as 
minders and cars to cope

meanwhile the quiet soviet pullout continues 
the soviets have handed over some key perimeter posts round the 
city to the afghan army stripped army recreation rooms at the 
airport and head north in armored columns up the 250mile salang 
highway to the soviet border 
under a unmandated agreeement 50000 soviet troops in 
afghanistan left by aug 15 and the remaining 50000 are to be gone

thirty years ago the communist bloc shattered with 
the bitter rift between china and the soviet union today the 
worlds two largest communist states are picking up the pieces of 
their longlost solidarity 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze arrives thursday to 
advance the accelerating process of political normalization between 
the two countries 
his visit is expected to lay the groundwork for soviet president 
mikhail gorbachevs visit during the spring for the first 
sinosoviet summit since nikita khrushchev and mao tsetung met for 
bitterly divisive talks in 1959 
gorbachevs talks with senior leader deng xiaoping and other 
officials will formally end a freeze on party and government 
relations that began when the two nations split over ideological and 
strategic differences in 1960 
economic and cultural relations have seen steady improvement 
since the two sides first embarked on political normalization talks 
in 1982 trade last year was an estimated 28 billion up from 300 
million in 1982 
the two countries will exchange nearly 1000 scholars this year 
compared to 10 in 1983 sister programs are being formed joint 
ventures established and tours conducted across borders once 
demarcated by barbed wire and bayonets 
chinas hardline stance toward the soviet union has softened in 
the past year as it joins the world trend toward detente and 
perceives major progress in what it labels the three obstacles 
to normal ties with moscow 
the most important obstacle soviet support for vietnams 
invasion of cambodia remains the toughest to overcome but in 
august the two sides for the first time met facetoface on the 
issue and agreed it was time for vietnam to get out china backer 
of the antivietnam resistance in cambodia has welcomed hanois 
plans to withdraw its troops by september 
gorbachev who has actively pursued an end to sinosoviet 
illwill has taken steps to remove the other two obstacles by 
pledging to end the soviet occupation of afghanistan and to reduce 
by 200000 men the soviet troops in asia mainly on the tense 
sinosoviet border 
despite the heady progress the real interests of china as it 
strives to bring better lives to its 1 billion people remain in 
furthering its economic technological and even cultural ties with 
the west 
chinese leaders insist they will never return to the sinosoviet 
relations of the 1950s when beijing depended on moscows economic 
largesse and obediently adhered to its strategic interests 
that halcyon period once described as lasting unbreakable and 
invincible actually comprised only a brief interlude in a long 
history of distrust and hostility between the two nations 
lenin and stalin showed disdain for maos peasantbased 
revolutionaries and forced the chinese communists to ally with the 
stronger nationalists in the 1920s and 1930s even when chiang 
kaisheks nationalists were bent on their destruction the soviets 
called the chinese radish communists red on the outside but 
white on the inside 
moscow continued to send arms to the nationalists during the 
193745 war against japan even though chiang spent most of his 
energies fighting maos forces rather than the japanese 
in the early 1950s shortly after the communist victory over the 
nationalists in 1949 the soviet union provided china with loans and 
technical assistance for heavy industry and several thousand 
military advisers 
but relations rapidly deteriorated in part because of personal 
antipathy between mao and khrushchev stalins successor 
the turning point was khrushchevs 1956 denunciation of stalin 
mao thought khrushchev was trying to usurp control of the 
communist world and said his efforts to ease tensions with the 
united states were undermining the unity of the communist bloc 
khrushchev believed maos communes and radical socialism were 
nonsense 
in 1959 khrushchev rescinded on an offer to supply beijing with a 
sample atomic bomb and in the summer of 1960 the kremlin 
stopped all aid to china pulling out more than 1000 technicians 
and effectively terminating more than 200 sovietbacked industrial 
projects 
in 1962 aroused by soviet propaganda 60000 moslem kazakhs in 
the far western chinese province of xinjiang fled to the soviet 
union while others staged uprisings against chinese troops that 
same year moscow continued to supply advanced jets to india then 
fighting a border war with china 
the two countries veered close to war in 1969 when fighting 
broke out along their disputed 5000mile border china claimed huge 
tracts of land it said tsarist russia had seized in unequal 
treaties of the 19th century 
chinese leaders partly to unify a nation then in the throes of 
the leftist cultural revolution launched a campaign to store grain 
dig air raid tunnels and move factories into the hinterlands in 
preparation for a soviet invasion 
the invasion never came but throughout the 1970s both sides 
maintained more than 1 million troops along the boundary chinas 
assertion that the soviet hegemonists represented the biggest 
threat to peace was a key factor in the resumption of relations in 
the 1970s with the united states 
relations with moscow only began to improve after maos death in 
1976 and the emergence of the pragmatic deng xiaoping who says 
there is no imminent threat of war and china must devote its 
energies to economic development

many state and municipal governments say they are confident they 
will escape the effects of last weeks supreme court ruling striking 
down a racial quota system for publicworks contracts because their 
plans are less strict 
boston and atlanta are among the exceptions and officials there 
say some programs may be jeopardized 
the justices by a 63 vote struck down a program in richmond 
va that required whiteowned companies bidding on any city 
contract to set aside 30 percent of the contracts value for 
minorityowned subcontractors 
the ruling said rigid racial quotas must be supported by evidence 
of past discrimination for example that blackowned enterprises 
tried to obtain construction contracts but were denied them without 
such evidence the use of racial quotas violates the 
equalprotection rights of whites the court said 
but many state affirmative action programs are voluntary have 
goals rather than mandatory targets for minority participation or 
were based on evidence of discrimination said a sampling of 
officials contacted by the associated press 
michigan authorities are confident the us supreme court will 
uphold their law which requires 7 percent of all purchasing and 
construction grants to go to minorityowned businesses and 5 percent 
to go to businesses owned by women 
state officials say they believe enough evidence about 
discrimination was presented before the law took effect it took 
10 years of bill introductions and hearings to get it through the 
legislature said john roy castillo executive director of the 
civil rights commission 
a california program that took effect this month should survive 
an expected challenge because it sets goals not absolute quotas of 
15 percent for minority participation in state business and 5 
percent for womenowned companies said assemblywoman maxine waters 
however attorney john findley of the pacific legal foundation 
said minority contracting plans in california have one thing in 
common with the richmond measure theres no showing of past 
discrimination and a program designed specifically to remedy it 
according to the state department of finances population 
research unit californias 278 million population is 24 percent 
hispanic 7 percent black and 9 percent asian and others 
baltimore requires prime contractors to subcontract 20 percent of 
a projects worth to minority contractors and 3 percent to women 
but city council vice president jacqueline mclean said the city 
addressed the high courts major objections to richmonds law 
we held lengthy hearings and established a clear and convincing 
record of past discrimination against minority contractors ms 
mclean said baltimore is 54 percent black 
the supreme courts ruling has an economic effect in richmond 
richmond is 52 percent minority according to city manager robert 
c bobb before the ordinance went into effect less than 1 percent 
of the citys construction work was awarded to minority companies 
he said 
during the life of the ordinance minority companies were awarded 
about 40 percent of the citys work since the laws suspension in 
july 1987 because of the litigation the percentage has dropped back 
below 2 percent bobb said 
the georgia supreme court is considering a challenge to atlantas 
35 percent minority business enterprise program and officials of 
the blackmajority city fear the state court might take its cue from 
the ruling in the richmond case 
the atlanta program has almost exactly the same defects that 
richmonds has said william o miller president of the 
southeastern legal foundation a conservative group challenging 
atlantas program 
last year atlanta awarded 249 million in jobs to minorityowned 
businesses 367 percent of all of its contracts more than 300 
million in city business has gone to minority contractors since the 
35 percent minority setaside program was established in 1975 
boston mayor raymond l flynn said he feared the ruling could 
jeopardize some of his citys affirmative action programs in 
development hiring and contracts 
a city ordinance adopted in 1987 required boston to award 15 
percent of all contracts to businesses owned by minorities and 5 
percent to businesses owned by women 
boston is about 35 percent minority minorities and women 
received 27 million in city contracts in fiscal 1988 about 14 
percent of the total eligible dollars said sheila hubbard director 
of the mayors minority and women business office that compares 
with 152 million in fiscal 1985 
a louisiana law guarantees minority companies 10 percent or more 
of state and some local government business and various localities 
have similar laws 
angelisa harris executive director of louisianas office of 
minority and womens business enterprise said that while the 
richmond ruling may force louisiana to provide additional 
documentation to justify its programs she believes they will be 
able to continue operating

ron brown says he will not pick a fight with 
jesse jackson to demonstrate his independence as the new democratic 
party chairman but that there are bound to be conflicts with the 
presidential candidate he worked for in 1988 
im not looking for it trying to orchestrate it brown said 
in an interview last week in advance of succeeding paul g kirk jr 
in the party post im sure at one time or another ill have the 
opportunity to demonstrate independence from any of the potential 
candidates in 92 
browns election to the party chairmanship was assured last week 
when three of his four rivals for the post dropped out and endorsed 
him only former rep jim jones of oklahoma continued his challenge 
but there was near unanimous agreement within the party that brown 
will be a sure winner when the democratic national committee votes 
feb 10 
john henry anderson the georgia democratic party chairman who 
had supported one of browns rivals said there was no doubt in 
his mind that brown would win 
to overcome the perception that the incoming chairman is too 
liberal anderson said brown must establish his independence from 
any groups and find us a candidate in four years who will appeal to 
the broad base of the electorate 
opponents of the washington lawyerlobbyist who will be the 
first black politician to hold the top party post cited his ties to 
jackson sen edward m kennedy and gov mario cuomo as evidence he 
would give ammunition to those trying to paint the democrats as too 
liberal 
what does it take to help us win brown asked rhetorically 
it doesnt have anything to do with the ideology of the chairman 
that is a totally irrelevant consideration 
we have fallen into a trap of allowing our enemies our 
opponents or adversaries to define us i think its time for us to 
define ourselves and let the american people know what it means to 
be a democrat 
he said the party must do a better job defining its positions on 
national security crime and drugs 
weve got to get out of the box of having some people in this 
country believe that we are the party that blames america for 
everything thats wrong in the world said brown 
he said congress would be the principal shaper of the party 
message and that he hoped to participate in leadership discussions 
on capitol hill 
brown described himself as one of the several messengers that 
have the ability and skills to be a strong advocate 
he rejected the advice of many party activists that he must take 
some symbolic action to demonstrate his independence 
i dont believe that he said ive passed the test ive 
been judged to be a fair and reasonable and common sense person 
thats why it looks like were going to have a celebration here in 
february instead of a fight 
at the same time he said i am very sensitive to concerns that 
people have raised about perception 
brown said he would travel to the south soon and go to some 
statehouses and meet with governors and democratic party leaders to 
demonstrate that i want to reach out 
in the closing weeks of the campaign for the democratic 
presidential nomination brown agreed to become convention manager 
for jackson and some party activists are concerned about the 
perception that he is a jackson partisan a perception he says is 
incorrect 
when asked whether he felt he must do something to demonstrate 
independence from jackson brown replied weve got to stop 
treating jesse like some kind of irrational being hes a 
reasonable rational political figure political leader 
brown continued i think he understands full well there might 
be times the next four years where we disagree on something where 
by the nature of my position and my role and the nature of his 
position and his role it just makes sense that wed be on different 
sides and i dont know thats going to be such a traumatic thing

a soviet factory ship stationed two 
miles off the coast has been a boon to local fishermen who find 
herring plentiful but buyers scarce americans they say turn their 
noses up at the stuff but the russians have a taste for it 
years ago every worker went to work with a can of sardines in 
his lunch box our eating habits have changed said spencer 
fuller president of resource trading co the portland maine 
company that set up the venture with the russians 
americans now eat less herring than ever according to robert a 
hall who tracks seafood markets for the national marine fisheries 
service in 1936 americans consumed 13 pounds of sardines or 
young herring per person in 1987 that had fallen to 03 pounds 
per person he said 
russians who figure they wont fill their processing ship here 
until april are the worlds biggest herring eaters followed by the 
eastern bloc countries west germany and japan 
the main us market for the adult fish is pickled herring a 
traditional german dish with only a limited following here 
making matters worse a boom in the herring export market turned 
to bust in the mid1970s overfishing depleted the herring stock in 
the north sea europes main fishing grounds and a cheap dollar 
boosted demand increasing the price of new england sea herring to 
150 per ton 
then the north sea herring population rebounded the dollar rose 
in the early 1980s and the price of herring plunged to about 100 
per ton canners and processors from gloucester to maine closed 
their doors 
so whats happening is the herring stock is growing like mad 
but theres no one taking the fish said ambrose alley a 
fisherman based in vinalhaven maine 
alley said he is reduced to selling most of his catch for lobster 
bait and the rest as food for zoo animals 
but lobsters are out of season and the herring to be caught in 
january are 9 to 12 inches long too big for seals whales and 
dolphins alley said 
alley sailed his 42foot night owl to gloucester last week and 
has already sold 400 tons of herring to the russian factory ship 
sovetsk for 95 a ton 
it means keeping busy alley said it means making ends 
meet a lot easier 
about four boats from maine and two from gloucester are fishing 
each night weather permitting and pumping their catch directly 
into the 330foot factory ship alley said with a crew of 91 men 
and three women the sovetsk can process and freeze about 80 tons of 
herring a day 
it will also buy 500 tons of frozen herring from gloucesters two 
remaining processing plants providing an outlet for trawlers that 
snare herring while dragging for more profitable species said dan 
mckiernan of the massachusetts division of marine fisheries which 
approved the soviet ships visit 
the total 4500ton haul will be worth about 600000 to local 
fishermen and processing plants fuller said the soviets are paying 
in dollars i dont accept rubles he said 
maine has permitted two previous excursions by soviet factory 
ships to process underfished species 
the sovetsks visit was approved by gov michael s dukakis in 
november after state marine biologists determined that its 4000ton 
catch would not deplete the herring stock mckiernan said next 
summer an east german ship will be allowed to take 3500 tons 
relations between the fishermen and the russian crew have been 
friendly said paul palino a fisherman from new harbor maine who 
was invited into the sovetsks captains cabin for a chat through 
an interpreter and a glass of vodka 
fuller said he is trying to obtain visas for the ships crew so 
they can have shore leave in february he said there is little fear 
of defections 
the poles jump ship like rats but the russians its a good 
berth for them he said they get paid well and they get to see 
the world im trying to arrange for them to come ashore to shop 
at the malls and be capitalists for a day

a buoyant lech walesa predicted saturday 
that authorities will legalize solidarity next month and that the 
union will play a key role in helping the government solve polands 
economic problems 
im convinced poland needs understanding and first of all 
agreement we are committed to agreement we must seek agreement 
to get the situation under control the solidarity leader said at 
a news conference 
solidarity officials and top government leaders on friday set a 
feb 6 date for longawaited broadbased talks on the future of the 
banned union and reforms to combat polands economic and political 
crisis 
walesa said solidaritys aim is to deal with the government not 
usurp it i said it in 1981 and i repeat it now we dont want to 
take over power we cant it would be fatal but we have a deal to 
make with this government 
he also said the talks known as the round table could help 
open the way for other groups that like solidarity do not have 
communist party approval to participate in trade union economic 
and political activities 
today im thinking about our chances and when i see we are 
breaking the monopoly im convinced we have great chances walesa 
said 
the talks appear to be part of a government attempt to bring the 
opposition into the battle against polands economic decline which 
has led to chronic shortages a massive foreign debt and an 
apathetic populace 
the government first proposed the talks in august during a wave 
of strikes that marked polands worst labor unrest since solidarity 
was crushed in the martial law crackdown of 1981 
the government banned solidarity in october 1982 and walesa 
refused to agree to talks until it reinstated the trade union 
in a dramatic reversal of policy last week the communist party 
central committee offered to legalize solidarity if the union agreed 
to obey the law and among other conditions stop accepting 
financial aid from the west 
last sunday solidaritys leaderhship agreed to negotiations on 
the offer 
walesa said the talks should be kept as short as possible 
as far as the round table goes we have said many times and 
repeat it we want to make it as fast as possible the tentative 
time is six weeks he said but there are terribly difficult and 
complicated problems and they cant be solved that quickly 
walesa said he envisioned solidarity becoming a strong trade 
union with good relations with the government 
we cannot say there will be no problems and no accusations 
he said they will be there and we can only say we will do 
everything to minimize them we are not seeking conflicts 
we have to build poland we will not solve problems with 
strikes 
in the past the authorities have accused solidarity of acting as 
a political movement but walesa said he was interested only in 
developing a good trade union 
its impossible to be a good trade union in our present 
conditions he said we must have economic legal and political 
conditions to be a good union

a man was sentenced to 30 years in prison 
early saturday after being convicted of aggravated kidnapping in the 
abduction and gang rape of a woman who was forced to testify under 
threat of jail 
felipe chew 29 was the second to be tried and convicted out of 
10 men indicted after the 19yearold woman reported being abducted 
the night of march 26 and later raped by as many as 20 men the 
first was sentenced to 20 years 
district attorney heriberto silva asked the jury to deny 
probation saying would you let your daughter go out with him 
knowing that would you let your sister would you invite him over 
to your house tomorrow 
chew showed little reaction when the guilty verdict was read 
shortly before midnight friday after 5 hours of deliberation nor 
when the jury returned with the 30year prison sentence and 6000 
fine about 3 am saturday 
courtappointed defense attorney jaime garza called the 
punishment excessive and said he expects the verdict to prompt plea 
bargains from the remaining eight defendants all of whom have 
pleaded innocent to charges ranging from sexual assault to 
kidnapping to aggravated kidnapping 
this is a judgment that for me is hard to digest garza told 
the jurors while asking them to grant probation i am far more 
than an advocate i firmly believe in his innocence 
he said the victim voluntarily got into chews car with chew and 
three other men on march 26 and offered herself to multiple sex 
partners at a ranch where men had gathered for an illegal cockfight 
garza said she fabricated the kidnapping and rape story out of fear 
of her jealous husband 
she got herself into a situation that she could not explain to 
her husband a very rough situation garza said she took on a

soviet planes today flew in emergency 
food and fuel to the embattled capital and more countries 
considered joining the united states in closing their embassies 
before the red army pulls out 
the planes flew the emergency supplies to kabul airport and 
convoys of at least 112 trucks hauled the food and fuel to silos and 
gasoline stations where long lines began forming at dawn 
some of the fuel trucks headed up the salang highway the only 
land route open from kabul to the soviet union the 250mile highway 
passes through territory controlled by moslem guerrillas who have 
been fighting the sovietbacked kabul government the past decade 
in islamabad pakistan a moslem guerrilla leader charged today 
that warplanes from soviet bases have been bombing dozens of 
villages in afghanistan causing hundreds of casualties 
burhanuddin rabbani chief of a rebel faction known as 
jamiatiislami said the planes attacked targets that included 
villages along the salang highway 
he said the raids on the northern provinces of takhar and baghlan 
were made by warplanes flying from bases inside the soviet union he 
said other areas were hit by bombers from the soviets huge bagram 
airbase close to kabul 
he called for the united nations to intervene in an effort to 
halt the attacks 
the bombing has been very severe for the last three days 
leaving hundreds of casualties and destroying dozens of villages 
he told a news conference through an interpreter 
western diplomats reported thursday that soviets and the elite 
afghan special guard bombed and shelled villages on both ends of the 
highways salang tunnel on jan 23 they quoted eyewitnesses as 
saying that hundreds of civilians were killed in those attacks 
shortages have eased since the soviet food airlift began last 
week but afghans many wearing only light cotton clothing and 
sandals in the freezing weather waited stoically in lines for bread 
and gasoline 
the latest airlift came a day after several more noncommunist 
nations decided to close their embassies in afghanistan 
the first country to close its mission was west germany a week 
ago but when the united states announced thursday that it would 
soon withdraw its diplomats britain france and japan followed 
suit italian diplomats said their government was considering 
similar action and nonwestern diplomats said soviet allies would 
probably leave as soon as the soviet troop withdrawal is completed 
in new delhi the afghan embassy said austria also had decided to 
close its mission in kabul 
workers erected steel girders around the iranian embassy today 
but there was no immediate word whether tehran planned to close its 
diplomatic mission 
about 2 million afghan refugees live in iran which shelters and 
supports some of the guerrilla groups fighting the afghan 
government another 3 million afghan refugees live in pakistan 
where a separate alliance of ussupported guerrilla groups is 
headquartered 
the soviets have said they intend to keep their embassy open but 
it will operate with about 100 staff members onethird of what it 
was before the withdrawal entered its final stage 
two soviet military transport planes left kabul today with soviet 
families helicopter gunships escorted the planes over the hills 
ringing kabul airport the planes dropped flares which are designed 
to deflect heatseeking missiles fired by antigovernment guerrillas 
the us state department has said its last embassy staff members 
would leave kabul in a few days dependents and all but 11 diplomats 
and security guards already have departed in october the embassy 
had a staff of 21 us citizens 
a nonwestern diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
called the us decision to close the embassy all a part of 
washingtons maneuvering trying to show to the world that this 
government is on the verge of collapse 
the united states has predicted that president najibs government 
will fall from power soon after the soviet withdrawal is completed 
moslem guerrillas who get support from the united states saudi 
arabia and pakistan have vowed to keep fighting until najib is 
removed 
najibs government denounced the decisions to close embassies 
claiming it could provide necessary security even after the soviets 
leave 
under an agreement sponsored by the united nations the soviet 
union is to complete the withdrawal of its troops by feb 15 ending 
the kremlins military intervention that started in december 1979 to 
prop up its client regime in kabul 
an estimated 115000 soviet troopers were here when the 
withdrawal began may 15 and the last 50000 are to be gone by feb 
15 
they leave behind a conscript afghan army plagued by desertion 
diplomats say the army has been driven to dragging teenagers from 
their homes and pressing them into service

we never had such a warm dry and snowless january in oslo and 
the surrounding nordmarka forest area since 1897 when weather began 
to be recorded here said spokesman gustav bjoerbaek of oslos

rival shiite moslem militiamen fought a 
90minute gunbattle in the citys southern slums today and irans 
foreign minister flew to syria in a bid to reach a peace accord 
between the two groups 
police said one person was killed and three were wounded when the 
syrianbacked mainstream amal militia and proiranian fundamentalist 
hezbollah clashed with machine guns and rocketpropelled grenades in 
the early morning 
syrian troops in charge of security in beiruts moslem sector 
enforced a truce 
a car bomb in the bekaa valley of eastern lebanon wounded a 
syrian soldier and five lebanese civilians said a police spokesman 
the bombladen car exploded this morning near the town of barr 
elias victims were hospitalized in nearby zahleh city 25 miles 
east of beirut the police spokesman said 
beiruts voice of lebanon radio reported 50 casualties in the 
blast but gave no breakdown police denied that casualty figure 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility 
in a separate attack a bomb at the entrance to a building in 
moslem west beirut exploded later today wounding six people a 
police spokesman said 
the victims were rushed to a nearby hospital the spokesman said 
on condition of anonymity no other details were immediately 
available 
the car bombing was the second in lebanon this year one on jan 
13 killed seven people and wounded 15 in beiruts bir elabed suburb 
twenty such explosions last year killed 116 people and wounded 
448 by police count 
the new casualties in the militia fighting increased the toll to 
173 killed and 340 wounded since the latest round of intershiite 
fighting broke out in beirut on dec 31 and spread to south lebanon 
in tehran the official islamic republic news agency reported 
that foreign minister ali akbar velayati left for damascus to resume 
talks on the intershiite power struggle that has dragged on for 
nine months 
the agency monitored in cyprus quoted velayati as saying he 
hoped this time to establish a comprehensive accord between the 
groups with the cooperation of syria and political and religious 
personalities in lebanon 
velayati earlier in the week held several meetings with his 
syrian counterpart farouk alsharaa and hezbollah officials in 
damascus but no settlement was reached 
amal and hezbollah are vying to dominate the 1 million shiites 
who are lebanons largest single sect 
clashes in april may and november last year killed more than 500 
people and wounded 1500 
hezbollah wants to establish an islamic republic patterned after 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis revolution 
the more secular amal resents irans influence and wants a 
coalition government including the christians who traditionally 
have dominated lebanese politics 
syria has about 40000 troops in the moslem sector of beirut and 
in the eastern and northern provinces it is seeking to end the 
countrys nearly 14yearold civil war

rebels are preparing assaults on 
major military targets following the governments rejection of their 
offer to participate in elections according to official and 
guerrilla sources 
president bushs new administration meanwhile is trying to 
persuade salvadoran leaders to soften their negative response to the 
revolutionaries 
the marxistled insurgents who condemned and did all they could 
to frustrate five national elections since 1980 offered tuesday to 
take part in this years presidential balloting under certain 
conditions 
we have made a proposal to the degree that the other side does 
not respond positively the masses see that the struggle must 
continue the tendency toward violence is increasing guerrilla 
commander ana guadalupe martinez told reporters in mexico city 
the proposal has caused intense debate in el salvador and 
washington which has given more than 3 billion in aid to el 
salvador the country is the most favored recipient of us funds in 
the western hemisphere this decade 
president jose napoleon duarte said wednesday of the guerrilla 
document this is not a proposal for peace it is a proposal for 
war 
it was plagued with unconstitutionalities he said foremost 
among them the guerrillas demand that he postpone the elections 
from march 19 to september to allow for reforms and their 
participation he also cited threats to aggravate the conflict 
if the proposal were rejected 
we are preparing for a very strong military reaction a 
highranking army officer told the associated press he said 
military intelligence believes the rebels in the next two weeks will 
hit at least one important strategic target probably in the capital 
the officer who spoke on condition of anonymity acknowledged 
the elections proposal enhanced an image of rebel willingness to 
pursue peace 
that also is the consensus among diplomats even government 
officials grudgingly admit it 
but duartes government considers the guerrilla document tactical 
and insincere a pretense to intensify violence was how the 
official sisal news agency described it 
ms martinez in interviews taped in mexico and broadcast in el 
salvador indicated the rebels had little hope their proposal would 
be accepted by the incumbent christian democrats or the rightist 
republican nationalist alliance 
the alliance known as arena controls the legislature and leads 
presidential polls the leftist democratic convergence is a distant 
third 
arena leaders rejected the rebel proposal out of hand as a 
trap and a sirens song 
the guerrillas said they would back the convergence in an 
election in the past rebels denounced elections as a 
usimposed counterinsurgency plan 
a source close to the guerrillas said the proposal is legitimate 
but that it also is designed to underscore contradictions it 
shows the christian democrats and arena for what they are that they 
are more interested in power than democracy and peace 
major rebel attacks are imminent he said 
state department spokesman charles redman on thursday sought to 
play down duartes rejection of key elements of the proposal in 
comments to washington reporters he emphasized duartes positive 
assessment of the rebels recognition of electoral legitimacy 
any proposal such as this is worthy of serious and substantive 
consideration said redman 
a western diplomat in san salvador said the bush administration 
is trying soften duartes emphatic rejection 
its hard to convince the american congress and people that 
theres a serious government and business class here when in less 
than 24 hours they come out with a flatout no to a significant 
proposal he said 
a labor and farmworkers union linked to the christian democrats 
called thursday for a plebiscite on the plan 
guillermo ungo the convergence presidential candidate told a 
news conference thursday i ask myself what the mothers of the 
tens of thousands of soldiers and guerrillas think of the 
governments rejection of a proposal that could be an important step 
toward peace 
two radio stations on thursday asked listeners to air their views 
on the insurgent proposals they fielded calls from 158 people 
eighty in the informal and unscientific survey expressed support 
for the rebel proposal while 78 said it should be rejected

the ghost of a man deposed three times 
by the military is riding the campaign trail as panamas opposition 
tries again to defeat gen manuel antonio noriega and bring civilian 
rule to this country 
it is going to be the people against the military said 
guillermo endara 52 who is running for president under the banner 
of a coalition formed in memory of the late arnulfo arias madrid 
the elections are scheduled for may 7 
the government candidate to be selected shortly will be backed 
by the resources of noriega head of panamas military 
in traditional panamanian fashion the arias legacy is claimed by 
several political factions anti and progovernment 
arias died in august at age 86 and his burial brought forth the 
largest public demonstration ever of loyalty to a panamanian 
politician 
some of the oppositions leaders have been expelled from the 
country and the endara coalition is counting on arias popularity 
and the appeal of his widow mireya for a strong showing in the 
elections 
politicians and others interviewed last week by the associated 
press said a ticket led by endara a former arias collaborator is 
not the best strategy for victory but they hope to turn the 
elections into a referendum on noriega 
on the ticket as candidates for panamas two vice presidential 
posts are ricardo arias calderon of the small but wellorganized 
christian democrat party and guillermo ford of the liberal 
republican movement 
we do not have any illusion about the elections but they will 
be another chance for the people to show their rejection of the 
military regime said carlos valencia president of the 
industrialists association and a member of the civic crusade an 
organization of civic and independent business groups 
the military closed the offices of the industrialists 
association seven months ago news media favorable to the opposition 
were closed early last year 
opposition leaders say privately they do not expect noriega to 
surrender power if his supporters lose the elections 
but they hope a political event will happen that will bring us 
closer to democracy said one politician who requested anonymity 
maybe they will postpone the elections or noriega will be 
overthrown by other military 
noriega has survived more than a year of us attempts to 
overthrow him including an indictment on federal drugrelated 
charges in florida and sanctions that have battered panamas economy 
he broke a general strike crushed public demonstrations and 
presented himself in this country and abroad as a defender of 
panamanian sovereignty 
noriega says the united states wants him out to make it easier 
for it to renege on the panama canal treaties which call for us 
forces to leave in the year 2000 
he has been in command since 1983 and could run for president as 
a civilian but it is believed noriega will back a civilian from the 
governments revolutionary democratic party 
since taking over noriega has deposed three presidents he 
installed the current president manuel solis palma in february 
last year 
noriega was in charge in 1984 when in the first presidential 
election in 16 years arias lost a close election tainted by charges 
of fraud 
arias was overthrown by the military in 1941 after one year in 
power in 1948 after almost two years and in 1968 after 11 days 
endara and his group were expelled from ariass authentic 
panamanian party by another faction that now is expected to field 
its own opposition candidate 
they the opposition will be divided again said tomas 
altamirano duque editor of the newspaper la estrella and a 
government party congressman 
the government is confident it will win the elections he said

year for mine disasters in communist chinas history an official 
newspaper said saturday

mine accidents

ted bundy was wellliked by many fellow death 
row inmates but some believed that his death might paradoxically be 
a good thing for them two of bundys former inmate neighbors say 
james doug mccray who has been on death row for 14 years said 
some florida state prison inmates expressed hope that bundys death 
last tuesday would satisfy a public desire for executions and cause 
support for the death penalty to recede 
i think over the years with the kill bundy syndrome i think 
what has developed on death row is sort of a belief that if bundy 
were dead then a great number of us would have a chance to live 
because of societys misconceptions that we were a death row of ted 
bundys mccray told the florida timesunion in jacksonville for an 
article published saturday 
another inmate once housed next to bundy michael bruno said 
there were varied opinions about bundys fate 
a lot of people didnt like him a lot of people thought he was 
all right said bruno who has been on death row since october 
1987 really when it comes to sex crimes toward women and 
children its not looked good upon by other inmates 
bundy 42 was executed for the february 1978 murder of 
12yearold kimberly leach of lake city he was also sentenced to 
death for two other murders in florida and authorities say he 
confessed in his last week to more than 20 murders in other states 
in all bundy is a suspect in more than 100 murders and 
disappearances 
both bruno and mccray said they liked bundy and enjoyed living in 
cells next to him mccray said he lived next to bundy for about two 
years bruno said he was housed next to bundy for six months 
bruno 37 said he and bundy would play handball together in the 
prison exercise yard and bundy always was respectful to brunos 
relatives when they came to visit 
although the inmates never discussed bundys cases with him 
mccray and bruno said they were surprised to hear him confess to 
being a killer during an interview taped shortly before his 
execution by that time bundy had been moved to another area of the 
prison 
i find it hard to believe its not the same ted bundy 
bruno said even when he started confessing to all these things i 
couldnt believe it 
mccray 39 who was sentenced for the rape and murder of a 
64yearold woman in 1973 said he would talk into the early hours 
of the morning with bundy and found him to be witty and bright 
rather than the killer he confessed to be in his final days 
the ted bundy i knew here at fsp florida state prison for 11 
years was not that person that committed those crimes mccray 
said i never viewed ted as a seething psychopath 
bundy who once attended law school and worked for the republican 
party in washington state was sometimes harassed verbally by other 
inmates many of whom are black and poor mccray said 
black men viewed ted as being a disciple of the system the 
very system which we are fighting because he had grown up with all 
of the advantages mccray said therefore a grotesque form of 
resentment occurred

first annual plan to resolve the mia issue and the provision of us 
humanitarian aid to the southeast asian nation 
the united states over the past two years has provided more food 
and medical aid to laos and the vientiane government has 
significantly increased cooperation in searching for the missing 
allowing several joint searches of wartime crash sites 
those efforts were criticized friday by former north carolina 
rep william m hendon who said everything the government has 
tried has not for one reason or another succeeded in bringing out 
american prisoners he believes still are alive in indochina a total 
of 2383 americans are listed as mia from wars in vietnam laos and 
cambodia 
hendon of mclean va is traveling this weekend to thailands 
mekong river boundary with laos to continue publicizing a 25 
million reward offered by 21 congressmen to any indochinese who 
returns a pow to american custody 
the word is getting in there we are doing our best to find an 
honorable solution to a very difficult situation he told 
reporters 
tons of intelligence indicated that live americans still are 
held in indochina but excavating crash sites was not the way to go 
about extricating them said hendon who heads the private pow 
publicity fund 
hendon said the united states was very close in 1983 to 
getting pows back following a mission authorized by the white house 
during which he helped bring 225000 worth of medicine to laos in 
exchange for live americans 
the mission failed hendon claimed because public exposures of 
clandestine activities in iran and central america forced the 
administration to abort such dealings around the world the us 
government has criticized private groups illegal forays into laos 
in search of pows 
before the talks the us defense department said the meetings 
would involve scheduling surveys and excavations following a january 
agreement to establish a yearround powmia work plan 
ms isom led the american delegation which included technical 
experts from the us joint casualty resolution center and the us

followers of political cult leader lyndon 
h larouche jr say they will hold a roundtheclock vigil near the 
white house until he is released from federal prison government 
lawyers say that wont happen for at least five years 
larouche 66 a threetime presidential fringe candidate was 
sentenced friday to 15 years for scheming to defraud the internal 
revenue service and deliberately failing to repay loans from his 
political supporters 
evidence showed larouches fundraising activities produced more 
than 30 million and that he failed to repay 294000 in such loans 
he could have received a maximum of 65 years in prison and fines 
totaling 325 million for his conviction on 13 counts of tax and 
mail fraud and conspiracy 
assistant us attorney john markham says larouche will serve a 
minimum of five years in a yetundecided prison before he is 
eligible for parole 
larouche and six associates were transferred in handcuffs from 
us district court to the city jail in this washington suburb 
before being assigned permanently to a federal prison 
the six associates received lesser penalties ranging from three 
to five years imprisonment and fines of 6000 to 11000 for 
their roles in the fundraising scheme 
larouche was convicted by a federal trial jury dec 16 on all 13 
counts of an indictment charging him with tax and mail fraud 
conspiracy it was his first criminal conviction in a long and 
controversial political career 
while chief us district judge albert v bryan jr was imposing 
sentences friday government prosecutors dropped all charges in a 
related case in boston against larouche six aides and five 
political organizations 
the us attorneys office in boston said that case involving 
allegations that larouches 1984 presidential campaign raised more 
than 2 million through credit card and loan fraud was being 
abandoned because of the successful prosecution in alexandria 
larouche attorney odin anderson said all seven defendants are 
appealing bryan denied their request friday to be released on bail 
pending the outcome of their appeals 
before his sentencing larouche told the judge that in effect i 
was consigned to hell because he had rejected a deal offered by 
highlevel figures in the angloamerican liberal establishment 
with an implicit promise of lenient treatment in court 
larouche did not say what the alleged deal involved but said it 
underscored his belief that government prosecutors were seeking to 
eliminate me from the political scene 
bryan snapped that claims of political motivation behind the case 
were arrant nonsense but larouche said it was time for this 
evil and reckless prosecution to be brought to a halt before further 
damage is done to us national security interests 
the judge said he was bothered that none of the defendants had 
conceded wrongdoing or expressed remorse over the millions of 
dollars in defaulted loans they took from larouche supporters many 
of them elderly retirees whose life savings were lost 
one of the seven defendants larouche legal coordinator edward 
spannaus said that remorse should be felt by those who perverted 
our judicial system for political purposes and trampled on the 
constitution 
larouche spokeswoman dana scanlon said a small group of 
demonstrators had begun a nonstop vigil in lafayette park across 
pennsylvania avenue from the white house with a large illuminated 
sign reading pardon larouche she said the sign will be within 
president bushs view from the white house 
in mexico city on friday about a dozen larouche supporters held 
a protest march in front of the monument of independence also known 
as the angel they carried signs that read larouche is innocent

at one end of the exhibit hall the video image of 
former cbs news president van gordon sauter soundlessly hawks

telephone 
at the other end 72yearold retired pennsylvania butcher frank 
maturo makes bloody marys for passersby while his son tries to sell 
their 60second show your minute message on meat 
what both booths at the annual convention of the national 
association of programming executives have in common is few buyers 
they sat next to joan rivers and had their pictures taken but 
most station representatives had already committed themselves to 
syndication hits such as king worlds wheel of fortune or 
tribune entertainments geraldo and had little space on their 
schedules for anything new 
the annual natpe convention a syndicated television bazaar 
typically features more tackiness than trading but this years 
convention reflected a downturn in an industry battling cable and 
video alternatives 
still the exhibit floor of the george brown convention center 
provided a sensory overload of lights glamour and glitter there 
were celebrities showgirls lifesize cartoon characters and live 
animals including a giant albino python helping pitch a program 
called montys traveling reptile show 
this is a shopping mall from hell said ron powers the 
former cbs sunday morning media critic here on assignment for gq 
magazine 
despite the state of the industry natpe had more than 7300 
participants down only slightly from the 7500 of last year 
it was not a good year for both the buyer and seller but what 
did happen here its a chance to get together and cry in each 
others beer so to speak said natpe president phil corvo 
i would say its somewhat more subdued in the last year or 
two said norman horowitz president of mgmua telecommunications 
inc which was offering hotline the game show produced by 
sauters company cable is taking a big bite out of 
broadcasting video is taking a big bite out of everybody so 
that it is somewhat subdued but its a business with a lot of money 
involved and a lot of people are going for it in whatever means 
available to them glitzy booths glitzy presentations last 
year with group one medical we did a cholesterol test and it 
was a knockout 
group one medical was one of a wave of realitybased 
shows offered last year that did not make it through the season 
the talk on the floor is that buyers are very apprehensive this 
year because last year they got burned by usa today said david 
sams coexecutive producer of rollergames one of the few new 
shows drawing any interest this year 
last years convention was abuzz over gtg entertainments 40 
million seeming sure thing usa today the television show a 
daily newsmagazine but the critics rejected it and the ratings 
were disappointing many stations have dropped or moved the show 
reality shows continued to be the order of the day the only new 
genre seemed to be socalled crash tv prompted by the success 
of syndicated wrestling shows 
american gladiators at least offered a peek at its stars 
male and female athletes who will take on competitors in a series of 
trashsport events rollergames had only a brief video clip 
and a slick brochure that promised a combination of roller derby and 
mtv 
the pitch seemed to be working sams said his sales had climbed 
from 57 percent of the country before the convention to about 75 
percent 
its all about hitting a nerve he said its all about 
capturing attention 
corvo predicted that syndication will suffer another down year 
but rebound in 199091 when contracts are up and stations are 
looking to replace programming 
over at the your minute message on meat booth frank maturos 
meatbuying tips played incessantly on a monitor in the background 
while son sam tried to sell the spots and gave thanks they werent

us defense experts lashed out at 
west germany on saturday accusing the bonn leadership of benign 
neglect of chemical weapons controls and a cavalier attitude 
toward its nato responsibilities 
the charges came during an annual conference for nato military 
strategists 
the meeting opened with a cautious speech by defense minister 
rupert scholz in which he gave only a hesitant endorsement to nato 
plans to extend the range of some europeanbased nuclear missiles 
scholz was attempting to straddle the fence between the us 
position that shortrange missile modernization is necessary to 
protect longstanding nato defense strategies and the broadly held 
view among west germans that missile replacement is unnecessary 
because of improving eastwest relations 
but his choice of a middle road was criticized by opponents and 
supporters of modernization and was followed by harsh criticism of 
west germanys behavior in a scandal involving a suspected libyan 
chemical weapons plant 
american charges that west german companies helped build the 
plant in libya have created serious tensions between the two nato 
partners 
us sen john s mccain rariz criticized scholz and the 
government for turning a blind eye to indications which he said 
have long linked west german companies to efforts by libya and iraqi 
to produce chemical weapons 
i know the west german government is denying what went on in 
libya and the foreign minister is claiming to be shocked mccain 
told the gathering of 171 defense experts but it seems 
increasingly apparent that the west german government has been 
denying what it has long known to be the truth 
mccain cast doubt on foreign minister hansdietrich genschers 
claim that he knew nothing of the alleged west german role in the 
libyan plant until november and declared we cannot tolerate 
benign neglect 
west germans were visibly stung by mccains words uniting across 
party lines to deflect the criticism 
egon bahr arms control expert for the opposition social 
democratic party said he was firmly convinced bonn was doing 
its utmost to investigate claims of wrongdoing by west german 
companies 
scholz denied he or other cabinet members had ignored warnings 
a month ago scholz became embroiled in a major political 
controversy in bonn for saying modernization was probably inevitable 
he put himself in for further criticism on saturday by making 
only one oblique reference to the issue in his speech stating that 
shortrange nuclear missiles must be kept modern 
the 1983 nato decision to refit existing shortrange nuclear 
missiles to extend their range beyond the limit of 300 miles is 
increasingly unpopular among europeans who believe that could block 
further arms control progress 
the opening day of the weekend conference churned up a debate on 
the missile replacement proposal and other points of contention 
among the 16 nations of the north atlantic treaty organization 
discussion was entirely dominated by the uswest german 
differences with speeches by the foreign ministers of britain 
turkey and italy largely ignored 
scholz gave american critics an opening by claiming an imbalance 
within the alliance that exposes west germany and other central 
europeans to greater risk than the north american member nations 
alfred dregger parliamentary leader of kohls christian 
democratic party told the americans that alliance burdens are not 
just a matter of dollars 
dregger and social democrat karsten voigt lamented the burdens of 
hosting nato missiles and maneuvers including lowflying fighter 
jet practices which have led to numerous accidents in their densely 
populated country 
the complaints prompted accusations from american participants 
that europeans have not been pulling their financial weight 
edward luttwak of georgetown university told the gathering that 
in the last 20 years other people have been living inside the 
house of strategic security without paying the rent 
us sen warren rudman a new hampshire republican accused 
scholz of wanting to have it both ways in being skeptical of 
soviet disarmament overtures but sensitive to public opinion that 
the kremlin under mikhail gorbachev poses less of a threat to the 
nato alliance 
rudman said the united states devotes up to 60 percent of its 
defense budget to natorelated defense and said the huge federal 
deficit facing the bush administration mandates a more equitable 
spread of the expense 
john tower the us defense secretarydesignate took no part in 
the discussion he was scheduled to speak sunday 
sen john glenn dohio warned that rapidly changing views of 
the german people pose a serious threat to nato and called on the 
bonn leadership to address this problem 
he referred to recent polls showing that most west germans sense 
no serious threat from the east bloc and 80 percent support for 
removal of all nuclear weapons from europe 
the annual munich conference known as the wehrkunde brings 
together military experts from all nato countries for discussions on 
strategy this years topic is alliances in a changing world

plans to place staunch prolifers in top posts 
at the health and human services department could have deep impact 
on family planning fetal research and other key programs say 
activists on the abortion issue 
just about any abortion issue that has to do with the medical 
delivery system will touch hhs in some fashion douglas johnson of 
the national right to life committee said last week following an 
agreement to ensure strong prolife representation in the 
departments top echelons 
the agreement from the administration came in response to concern 
among prolife lawmakers that president bushs nominee for hhs 
secretary dr louis sullivan could be lacking in antiabortion 
fervor 
theres no office aside from the presidency thats more 
influential in advancing the righttolife agenda said sen 
gordon humphrey rnh an fervent advocate of outlawing abortion 
humphrey sen orrin hatch rutah and rep vin weber rminn 
struck a deal last week with the white house they would agree to 
sullivans nomination and bush would fill other top slots at the 
agency with prolifers 
white house chief of staff john sununu later announced that 
sullivan had recommended constance j horner head of the office of 
personnel management as hhs undersecretary 
james o mason director of the centers for disease control was 
sullivans choice fpr assistant secretary for health a position 
that oversees the national institutes of health among other 
agencies 
both are well known as foes of abortion sununu said 
administration sources also said kay james a former spokeswoman 
for the national right to life committee has been recommended for 
assistant secretary for public affairs 
all three would be in positions to make and influence policy 
while congress defines the broad outlines its dictates on complex 
health issues usually leave the department with ample room to 
maneuver in enforcing the law and making rules and regulations 
the system puts considerable power in the hands of department 
officials 
concern among activists over the key positions is sharper than 
usual because the surpreme court recently agreed to hear a case that 
could narrow the legalization of abortion it decreed in the landmark 
1973 roe vs wade decision 
sullivan himself was stung last week when one lawmaker quoted 
the prospective secretary as saying he opposed overturning the roe 
vs wade ruling a capitol hill flareup ensued but sullivan quickly 
quelled the turmoil by meeting with with antiabortion lawmakers and 
assured them he supported bushs prolife position 
sullivans nomination already had raised concerns of 
antiabortion activists earlier when he was quoted in a newspaper 
article as saying he opposed abortion and he favored a womans right 
to choose later he said he supported bushs view that abortion 
should be allowed only in cases of rape incest and danger to the 
life of the mother 
prochoice forces say that even in the reagan administration 
with ties to the antiabortion movement there have usually been at 
least some restraints 
jo ann gasper an abortion foe was fired as deputy assistant 
secretary for population affairs in 1987 when she tried to block 
federal funds for planned parenthood family planning programs on 
grounds the organization also advocates abortion 
that shows the possibilities and the limitations said nancy 
broff legislative and political director of the national abortion 
rights action league it shows that people at that level have a 
fair amount of power to do good or do harm because the secretary 
cant make every decision but it also shows there can be some 
limits on what they can get away with 
those family planning grants are still an important issue at hhs 
after the gasper firing the department rewrote the guidelines for 
the 138 million in grants to deny funding to programs that include 
abortion counseling and referral in their services 
three lawsuits have been filed challenging the regulations two 
federal courts have ruled against the regulations one has ruled in 
favor and appeals have been filed in all three cases 
abortions are covered by the medicaid program the federalstate 
insurance program for the poor that is administered by hhs only if 
the life of the mother is in danger a relatively rare occurence 
in fiscal year 1988 federal medicaid funds covered 84 abortions at 
a cost of 61235 hhs said 
an estimated 15 million legal abortions are performed each year 
abortion foes say that though congress has restricted medicaid 
funding of abortions for the past 10 years hhs administrators have 
some discretion in deciding whether to allow coverage in their 
casebycase reviews

they may not rank with butch cassidy and 
the sundance kid but authorities say theyve uncovered perhaps the 
youngest group of train robbers a ring involving 42 children 
between the ages of 9 and 18 
gadsden county officials said friday they had identified the 
children and six adults from the panhandle community of 
chattahoochee accused of robbing idle boxcars of everything from hog 
livers to car tires 
the thefts mainly took place after school and during 
vacations said deputy jimmy hindman once the adults showed the 
kids what to do it became easy for them 
only five or six people had been arrested by saturday said maj 
aj pickels a spokesman for the county sheriffs department 
pickels said the ring had been in operation since september and 
was responsible for an undetermined amount of stolen merchandise 
what youve got is a few adults who were ringleaders and they 
were using the young people and they were reaping plenty of 
benefits pickels said 
jewelry clothes cases of designer tennis shoes leather hats 
car tires beer wine fruit juices 130 cases of sardines cases of 
frozen pork chops and at least 150 pounds of hog livers were stolen 
he said 
its unbelievable pickels said i think they were just 
using it for their personal use giving it to their friends or 
selling it to their friends 
hindman told the gadsden county times that cases of beer were 
sold for 4 or 5 and wine went for as little as 1 a gallon 
children told authorities they burglarized boxcars parked on 
sidings while workers repaired tracks betwen chattahoochee and 
quincy police said 
authorities arent sure how widespread the thefts have been since 
it takes railroad officials several weeks to learn if shipments have 
reached their destinations intact 
well probably bring it to a head next week sometime said 
pickels who predicted there could be more people involved than the 
ones already identified

the foreign minister has written to 
us secretary of state james baker proposing the two men confer on 
how to prevent libya from producing chemical weapons the ministry 
said saturday 
news of the letter comes amid us accusations that west german 
leaders looked the other way while german companies helped libya 
build a chemical plant allegedly capable of producing poison gas 
west german leaders deny they ignored american charges that 
german firms were involved in the libyan plant and point out that 
prosecutors are investigating a number of companies believed linked 
to the complex 
the letter from minister hansdietrich genscher appeared to be 
part of west germanys efforts to persuade american officials this 
country is seriously concerned that german companies may have broken 
export laws with shipments to libya and other countries 
in his letter to baker genscher proposed joint discussions 
over measures for the prevention of chemical weapons production in 
libya the west german foreign ministry said in a telex to the 
news media 
the statement did not explain what measures those would entail 
but the welt am sonntag newspaper said saturday that chancellor 
helmut kohl plans an act of solidarity with western industrial 
nations to make sure that libya does not receive missing 
construction components and materials necessary for the production 
of chemical weapons 
kohl is making efforts in talks with the allies for such a 
joint initiative welt am sonntag said 
former secretary of state george p shultz said before leaving 
office last week that the libyan plant had not reached the point of 
production and that it might not get there if western companies 
heeded us warnings 
libya claims the plant is intended for the production of 
pharmaceuticals and not poison gases 
welt am sonntag said it got its information from sources in the 
chancellors office the newspaper telexed copies of its report to 
other news organizations in advance of sundays publication 
according to the west german foreign ministry telex genscher 
also has urged that the european economic community launch a joint 
initiative with the goal of preventing the spread of chemical 
weapons 
west germanys export controls have come under increasing attack 
in the past few weeks because of the libyan scandal reports of west 
german help in building a suspected mustard gas plant in iraq and 
alleged shipments of materials that can be used to make atomic bombs 
to pakistan

a member of a small amish community who 
refuses to turn his 6yearold son over to a hospital for cancer 
treatment has been jailed on a contempt of court charge 
danny mast argued that chemotherapy was not helping his son 
amos who has abdominal cancer and that the boy has done much 
better on natural medicine such as herbs and vitamins that he 
learned at a clinic in mexico 
mast who lives 15 miles from elizabethtown in sonora in hardin 
county was jailed friday after a closed hearing before district 
judge janet coleman 
this is not only his decision its the decision of the whole 
group said james gregory a courtappointed attorney for mast 
religion permeates everything they do they believe they are 
better off to trust god then to get back in the chemotherapy which 
they feel would affect the remaining quality of this childs life 
the amish religion teaches separation from the world with plain 
dress and living and little reliance on modern conveniences 
we try to do without what we think we can get along without 
said eli troyer one of the communitys three preachers we do 
things like chemotherapy if we dont find anything better but we 
think we have 
troyer said the chemotherapy was like a poison and made the boy 
worse since beginning the natural medication amos is looking 
better troyer said 
mast declined to comment 
masts only requests at the jail were to be allowed to keep his 
family bible with him and to be put in a cell by himself both of 
which were honored said jailer louis lawson the man was very 
calm very polite very wellmannered 
the childs physician at kosair childrens hospital in louisville 
believes the boy is in danger without a medically proven treatment 
and filed the petition in hardin juvenile court seeking to resume 
therapy in december the hospital contacted the county attorneys 
office again this month because the child had never returned 
at a previous hearing mast produced an xray that he said shows 
his sons tumor had shrunk as a result of the natural treatment 
gregory said the only way mast could be released now is if the 
boy is produced or the case is decided otherwise if the boy dies 
for example 
but the lawyer said mast has told him he does not know where the 
boy is and will not produce his son 
mast is part of a conclave of 15 amish families who moved from 
tennessee to southern hardin county three years ago german is 
spoken in the community and homes lack electricity and running 
water the children attend a oneroom amish school 
state officials say the family has hidden the boy and believe he 
is in another amish community they said he would be taken into 
state custody if he is found and the chemotherapy treatments 
resumed 
however friends and relatives who accompanied mast to the 
hearing said the boy would not be turned over 
masts fatherinlaw monroe miller said he believes his 
grandson is being helped by the natural treatment but that if the 
boy isnt going to recover he should be able to die in peace rather 
than pain 
miller said he was not angered by the court ruling scripture 
says if they strike your right cheek you offer your left he said 
as he climbed into his buggy 
masts wife gave birth to a son wednesday and did not accompany 
her husband to the hearing 
assistant county attorney chris shaw declined to comment on the 
case because it involves a juvenile all records on juvenile cases 
are also closed to the public

a man whose mother hid a note in her 
underwear saying that her son killed her before she was found dead 
two years ago has pleaded innocent to a new indictment charging him 
theres no doubt hes depressed earl gray richard dziubaks 
attorney said after court friday wouldnt you be having to face 
charges again when you know you havent done anything 
dziubak 36 originally pleaded guilty to manslaughter after he 
admitted pushing his mother may hilda speiser 65 during an 
argument at the top of the basement stairs in their home in february 
1987 but experts later differed on whether it was the fall or a 
subsequent drug overdose that actually killed the woman 
dziubak said that after she fell down the stairs she rejected 
his offers of help and walked up two floors to her bedroom she was 
found dead in bed the next day having left a note stating dick 
killed me threw me down basement 
following his guilty plea dziubak was sentenced in june 1987 to 
an 81month prison term ramsey county district judge allan markert 
released dziubak in november 1988 and allowed him to withdraw his 
plea because of the experts conflicting views on what had actually 
killed the woman 
on wednesday a grand jury indicted dziubak on charges of 
seconddegree murder seconddegree manslaughter and thirddegree 
assault 
on friday markert let dziubak remain free without bond because 
the defendant had not fled the state after being released from 
prison had no record of violence and had a job 
gray said he will file a motion to dismiss the indictment for 
lack of probable cause and markert set a hearing date of march 1 
trial was scheduled for april 10

in a startling contradiction of the 
official view of history a politburo member said on saturday that 
the 1956 hungarian revolution was a popular uprising not a 
counterrevolution 
imre pozsgay became the first hungarian leader to publicly 
contradict the official view that the revolution which was 
suppressed by soviet tanks was a foreigninstigated 
counterrevolution designed to subvert the communist system 
pozsgay who heads a communist party panel investigating 
hungarys postwar history made his announcement in a radio 
interview 
his portrayal of the revolution as a popular uprising could 
signal the governments readiness to rehabilitate the men who led 
the upheaval premier imre nagy defense minister pal maleter and 
other top men in the shortlived revolutionary government were 
executed in 1958 and buried in unmarked graves 
in another development rezsoe nyers another reformer and father 
of the 1968 economic reform was quoted as saying he and other top 
officials favor a centerleft coalition to govern hungary after the 
1991 parliamentary elections 
nyers who is also on the politburo and in the government of 
premier miklos nemeth made the statement in an interview carried in 
the latest issue of the vienna news magazine profil to be published 
monday 
the comments by pozsgay and nyers underscored once again 
hungarys current pioneering role in political and economic reforms 
in the soviet bloc 
pozsgay speaking on hungarian radio in the 1968 hours news 
magazine made clear his comments reflect the factfinding work of 
the partys committee carrying out an inquiry into the hungarian 
history of the past 40 years 
but he refrained from commenting on the soviet role in crushing 
the revolution which led to heavy losses of life and a mass exodus 
of hungarians 
the working committe he heads was installed by the partys 
policysetting central committee at a meeting on friday the 
committee said the ruling communist party must radically once and 
for all break away from all remnants of stalinism and sincerely 
reveal the past this being the only way to lay the groundwork for a 
purified socialist policy pozsgay said 
he also noted the forthcoming reburial in marked graves of imre 
nagy and his associates was a humanitarian issue that concerns the 
families and not a rehabilitation as such about which one ought 
not to prophesy 
nagy was right on his 1953 program in the 195455 power 
crisis though a dispute still exists about his 1956 rule said 
the official who was made a politburo member in may 1988 when 
longtime party chief janos kadar was ousted 
but in october 1956 it was a popular uprising against a 
humiliating oligarchic rule a definition that might bring 
politics scholarship and public opinion closer together pozsgay 
said 
he added the term counterrevolution cannot stand its ground 
it is being revised a rethinking in under way while the 
international background is being looked into 
after the 194849 communist takeover in hungary pozsgay 
declared bearings were lost a series of crises ensued failures 
occurred and the dictatorship of the proletariat simply excluded 
the workers participation in handling their affairs following the 
nationalization drive 
pozsgay said the workers councils set up by the 1956 
insurgents gave workers the sense of acting again 
in the future the party must learn to live together with other 
parties proceeding in coalition with them or having them in 
opposition he said referring to a party law to be submitted to 
parliament by aug 1 1989 
nyers a respected economist and himself a onetime social 
democrat expressed similar views in the profil interview he gave 
after a meeting a week ago with austrian socialist party leaders in 
vienna 
nyers was asked whether his ruling communist party should form a 
coalition government with the recently revived social democratic 
party while the smallholders party another reemerging group 
remains in opposition 
he replied that would be conceivable but we strive at present 
for a broad coalition one in which also the smallholders party 
plays a role as a positive center that is a coalition of the left 
and the center 
this nyers explained would not be an allparty government but a 
majority government since other parties may also come into existence 
under a recently enacted law on association political groups may 
be be formed but their registration and activities will be governed 
by the party law to be passed later this year

twentysix years after the world teetered on the 
brink of a nuclear holocaust the soviets cubans and americans who 
guided their nations through the cuban missile crisis still disagree 
who was to blame 
though they smiled and chatted amiably there was much 
fingerpointing during an unprecedented twoday meeting among living 
officials involved in the crisis said one participant 
i am not sure all people have learned all the lessons from the 
1962 crisis theodore sorensen who was special counselor to 
president kennedy said in the session at a trade union center in 
southwest moscow 
although he didnt name names sorensen said some speakers still 
were overly concerned with national selfinterest and 
justification blaming everyone but themselves for letting the 
superpower showdown get out of hand 
there is plenty of blame to be shared by all countries 
represented here today said sorensen now a new york lawyer 
among those around the table were former defense secretary robert 
mcnamara and former national security adviser mcgeorge bundy on the 
american side 
the soviet side included former foreign minister andrei a 
gromyko and anatoly f dobrynin former ambassador to washington 
gromyko and dobrynin did not speak in the public session saturday 
that ended the meeting 
for the first time cubans joined their superpower colleagues in 
discussing the crisis their delegation was headed by politburo 
member jorge risquet who proposed another review session be held in 
cuba 
the focus was on october 1962 when the soviets deployed nuclear 
missiles in cuba and the united states imposed a naval blockade on 
the island and demanded and obtained the rockets removal 
bundy now a new york university history professor said the 
united states and the soviet union should have been more open about 
their intentions the soviets have said they sent nuclear missiles 
to cuba because they feared a us invasion of the island bundy 
said washington never had any such plan and was guilty of a deep 
failure of communication 
it led you to do something we would never even think of 
placing missiles in cuba bundy told the soviets the incident 
showed the danger of excessive secrecy in military matters he said 
there are still some who think secrets are their safety more 
often than not it is the other way around 
in a plea for more openness scott armstrong of a 
washingtonbased research group that obtained declassified us 
government documents about the cuban missile crisis appealed to the 
cubans and soviets to release their files 
armstrong of the national security archive pointed to three 
trunkloads of us documents placed on a nearby table 
risquet said his island had had enough of bullying by the 
superpowers and wanted opinions of small countries such as his to be 
respected 
sergo mikoyan who was executive secretary to his father former 
first deputy premier anastas mikoyan said even in disputes 
involving small countries the superpowers should know it is 
impossible to assume that a regional conflict will remain regional 
vitaly v zhurkin who heads a new soviet institute studying 
europe said the cuban missile crisis was unavoidable because of the 
superpowers approach to resolving conflicts at the time but he 
said the threat from both sides has been reduced because both 
recognize that nuclear weapons are not needed and that the economies 
of both no longer can sustain an arms race

a white offduty police officer was suspended 
after killing a black man in a dispute over the officers 
doubleparked car and a group of elected officials and clergy 
called for a special prosecutor in the case 
i wonder what would have happened if black officers had killed 
an italian grandmother in an italian neighborhood or if 
africanamerican police officers killed a jewish boy in a jewish 
neighborhood or beat an irishamerican to death in an irish 
neighborhood the rev herbert daughtry said friday 
stephen kelley 62 was shot to death monday by officer radames 
ortiz 24 authorities said 
the altercation started when kelley honked his horn at ortizs 
car which was doubleparked and blocking kelleys van outside his 
apartment building in brooklyn witnesses told police 
one of kelleys sons stuart 25 said he heard shots and ran 
outside and that ortiz told him you better watch it or ill 
shoot you too 
ortiz was suspended tuesday without pay and police say a grand 
jury is considering criminal charges against him his sister nancy 
silvestri who also is a police officer was with him and was 
relieved of her gun and given modified duty authorities said 
daughtry was joined at a news conference at the house of the lord 
church in downtown brooklyn by state rep major owens and 
assemblyman roger green 
a spokesman for brooklyn district attorney elizabeth holtzman 
said a special prosecutor wasnt needed because a bureau already has 
been established to investigate alleged misuse of force by police 
officers the law enforcement investigations bureau 
the spokesman glenn goldberg promised a full fair and 
professional investigation

pakistanis voted saturday in national 
and regional elections that are considered the first test of prime 
minister benazir bhuttos popularity since she was elected in 
november 
no violence or other problems were reported when polls closed 
said a duty officer at election commission headquarters 
there was no early estimate of voter turnout said the officer 
who by custom is not named results are expected late saturday or 
sunday 
three million of pakistans 48 million eligible voters were 
entitled to vote for 13 of the 237 national assembly seats and seven 
seats in three of the countrys four provincial legislatures 
earlier saturday the election commission announced one of the 
national assembly seats had been won by a member of ms bhuttos 
pakistan peoples party because it was uncontested 
voting took place in districts where candidates in november 
general elections won more than one seat or the vote was postponed 
because a candidate died 
the outcome cannot dent the position of ms bhutto who heads the 
federal government in islamabad on the basis of her sizeable 
majority bolstered by support from smaller groups and independent 
lawmakers 
at the center of the opposition is ghulam mustafa jatoi chairman 
of the nineparty islamic democratic alliance 
ms bhuttos biggest rival is contesting for the national 
assembly from the rural kot addu district of punjab pakistans 
biggest and richest province and the stronghold of jatois moslem 
coalition 
byelection results will indicate whether the two biggest parties 
have lost or gained popularity since the general elections

a prosecutor who prayed with ted bundy says 
he is quitting the prison ministry program that led him to the 
serial killer because of the disapproval of his constituents 
hundreds of phone calls and letters from people questioning state 
attorney john tanners involvement with bundy before last weeks 
execution have reached the prosecutors daytona beach office 
tanner said the reaction has turned from negative to 90 percent 
positive but some people are discussing a recall attempt 
a small percentage of the public is uncomfortable with it 
said tanner a bornagain christian who exchanged letters with bundy 
for about two years and has been state attorney for about a month 
they feel its somehow inappropriate 
i think public perception and trust is absolutely essential i 
want to keep public confidence in the office 
bundy invited tanner to visit after he wrote as part of his 
prison ministry while bundy was on death row tanner visited him 
about 50 times to pray and read the bible 
tanner asked gov bob martinez to delay bundys execution last

believed to have committed martinez refused and bundy was 
electrocuted tuesday for killing 12yearold kimberly leach of lake 
city before his death he confessed to 23 murders

i dont know of any reasons which would make me particularly

a state medical board committee found 
sufficient evidence to warrant revoking the license of a fertility 
specialist accused of telling women they were pregnant when he knew 
they were not 
a threephysician panel of the board decided at the end of a 
fivehour informal hearing friday that dr cecil b jacobson of 
vienna violated the virginia medical practices act 
the panel will tell the full board that it believes revocation of 
jacobsons license may be justified the final decision would be 
made after the full 16member board holds a formal hearing 
jacobson 52 credited with performing the first amniocentesis in 
the united states also was found to have defrauded six women who 
paid him up to 5000 each for fertility treatments the panel said 
he recently closed his tysons corner clinic 
several former patients who went to jacobson for fertility 
problems and testified friday had tears in their eyes and smiles on 
their faces at the panels finding 
i couldnt figure out what i was doing to kill these babies 
said sharon hayward who owns a printing business in camp springs 
i felt so guilty ms hayward said jacobson told her three times 
that she was pregnant when she was not 
jacobsons attorney tara mccarthy said the accusations from the 
witnesses and the nine lawsuits pending against jacobson were the 
complaints of disappointed women who had difficulty conceiving 
the other side of the coin is that he has treated a lot of 
patients who did get pregnant ms mccarthy said jacobson had 
no comment 
the findings of the informal virginia state hearing friday will 
be sent to jacobson in writing he then may surrender his license to 
avoid further proceedings from the state board 
the board of medicine charged jacobson with injecting several 
patients with a fertility drug on several occasions and conducting 
numerous ultrasound examinations telling them they were pregnant 
when they were not the drug causes symptoms that mimic pregnancy 
such as weight gain and postive urine tests 
jacobson also faces action from a federal agency earlier this 
month the federal trade commission filed consumer fraud charges 
against him alleging that he told potential patients his 
hormoneinjection treatments had resulted in successful pregnancies 
for 80 percent of his patients when in fact no more than 40 percent 
became pregnant 
in all said ftc chairman daniel oliver jacobson treated 
several hundred women who lost a total of from 400000 to 2 
million or more the ftc will be seeking a return of some of all of 
those fees oliver said 
much of fridays testimony concerned jacobsons interpretation of 
ultrasound tests on his patients which seek to examine a pregnant 
womans growing fetus by the use of ultrasonic waves 
jacobson maintained that he detected an embryonic sac in the 
ultrasound pictures indicating pregnancy however he later 
informed the patients that the pregnancy had ended and their bodies 
had reabsorbed the fetus 
jacobson said he is not currently practicing and that he is 
reviewing 25 years of work to prepare defense for multiple lawsuits 
some of the patients complaints were the subject of a 60 
minutes television segment last month

the internal revenue service has joined the fbi in 
an investigation of illegal trading at the nations two largest 
commodities exchanges a newspaper reported saturday 
a squad of 15 irs agents will look for possible income tax fraud 
including the skimming of profits and concealment of income the 
chicago tribune reported 
citing unidentified sources the newspaper said the agents had 
joined the fbi in examining documents obtained by federal subpoenas 
one investigator said some subjects of the inquiry face a dilemma 
in filling out 1988 federal tax returns the newspaper reported 
they must decide whether to record possibly illegal earnings that 
were documented by undercover operatives who investigated the 
exchanges or face charges of income tax evasion the source told 
the tribune 
the chicago mercantile exchange and the chicago board of trade 
were targeted by a twoyear federal investigation in which fbi 
agents posed as traders and secretly taperecorded conversations on 
the trading floor 
the fbi and us attorney anton valukas office refused again 
friday to confirm or deny the investigation was under way 
but published reports say some 200 subpoenas to appear before a 
grand jury have been served on more than 200 prominent brokers 
traders and trading firms some witnesses are expected to cooperate 
broadening the scope of the investigation 
despite the wideranging investigation the mercantile exchange 
and its european partners are moving ahead with plans for a 
worldwide trading system 
globex a project of the mercantile exchange and reuters america 
inc would link investors in north america europe and asia via an 
allnight electronic system for trading futures and options 
contracts on currency futures including the british pound the west 
german mark the swiss and french francs australian and canadian 
dollars and the japanese yen 
full trading worldwide is expected to begin in 1990 exchange 
spokesman andrew yemma said friday 
the system would kick in at 6 pm after the mercantile 
exchange closes at 315 pm and trade electronically with futures 
markets on other continents until 6 am before the exchange 
reopens at 720 am meaning mercantile exchange trading would be 
conducted nearly 20 hours a day 
yemma labeled completely erroneous reports that several 
european financial institutions backed away from the project because 
of the federal investigation 
the new york mercantile exchange voted thursday to join the 
venture 
the commodity futures trading commission the federal agency that 
regulates the industry must approve globex before it can begin 
operations

while staying at the lorraine king was shot to death april 4 
1968 on a motel balcony 
abernathy who succeeded king as president of the southern 
christian leadership conference thanked supporters of the project 
for building a memorial to the life of my dearest friend 
memphis lawyer darmy bailey who led the sevenyear effort to 
preserve the motel called the decision to turn it into a museum a 
victory over the unholy carnage that took place there 
but a small group of protesters nearby said king would have 
wanted to help the poor rather than make a museum some waived signs 
such as memphis dont let his dreams die too 
we feel our taxes could be better spent in some other way that 
would be similar to dr kings believes said a protester jon 
mclaughlin 
the 88 million cost of the museum is coming from the state 
city and shelby county governments part of the motel building will 
be razed and the wing where king stayed will be the centerpiece of 
the museum 
opponents have suggested a homeless shelter or health clinic 
instead bailey said he also favors better housing and health care 
but that the lorraine is needed as a monument to the civil rights 
struggle 
the lorraine began attracting visitors within months of the 
shooting after the motels owner turned kings room into a shrine 
a city report in 1980 said 70000 people visited the site each year 
on organized tours

the turbulent struggles of a youthful paul 
cezanne to develop his artistic style are spotlighted in a new 
exhibition of the french masters early works opening sunday at the 
national gallery of art 
harsh scenes of eroticism and violence appear among the 
portraits landscapes and still lifes in 57 paintings and 15 
drawings from the leastknown period of cezannes art when he 
abandoned law school and began painting in his 20s 
hardly any hint of cezannes future eminence as a major figure in 
the impressionist and postimpressionist movements or his prophetic 
influence on cubism and abstract art is evident in the exhibition 
which will run through april 30 
barbara bush wife of the president was given a private tour of 
the cezanne showing and some other exhibits at the gallery on 
saturday 
the show organized by the british art historian sir lawrence 
gowing debuted at the royal academy of arts in london last april 
and traveled to washington its only us appearance from the 
musee dorsay in paris 
cezanne scholar john rewald told reporters at a national gallery 
preview that the artists early works from the decade of the 1860s 
frequently have been dismissed as inferior to the great canvasses of 
his mature years 
but the early works can stand on their own feet rewald said 
even if he had died before his final period wed treasure him as 
a great artist 
whoever you pick as the father of modern art the first father 
has to be cezanne said gallery director j carter brown 
charles moffett senior curator of paintings at the national 
gallery said the exhibition is a portrait of the artist as a 
young man and gets us into the head and mind of one of the 
greatest painters of all time 
the paintings and drawings were selected from public and private 
collections in the united states europe the soviet union 
australia brazil and canada to complement the show the national 
gallery is displaying 25 later cezanne paintings from its own 
holdings and loans from the white house and three private us 
collections 
the paintings in the auxiliary show are serenely contemplative 
after the emotional thrashing and selfdoubts reflected in some of 
cezannes early works next door and they lead to another room where 
cezanne takes his place with the likes of monet and renoir 
among the later cezanne oils is the national gallerys bend in 
the road painted in the first decade of the 20th century with 
pastel planes that are unmistakable precursors of the cubism of 
georges braque and pablo picasso

fifteen dead sea lions have 
washed onto beaches in and near here since last weekend but 
authorities have been unable to determine what killed the marine 
mammals 
the latest four carcasses like the others appeared to be 
several weeks old and too decomposed to conduct a necropsy to 
determine a cause of death said jim lecky of the national marine 
fisheries service 
two sea lions were found thursday night the third was discovered 
early friday near and a fourth saturday morning and a fourth 
saturday morning all along the shore around huntington beach 
sea lion deaths are pretty common although its a little 
unusual to see this many in this short a time said lecky 
last year 18 dead sea lions were discovered on orange county 
beaches most them washing ashore during the winter 
possible causes of death include drowning in fishermens gill 
nets being shot at sea attacks by white sharks or viral infections

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will 
visit cuba in the first week of april the official cuban news 
agency reported saturday 
the visit was announced on cuban television saturday the prensa 
latina news agency said in an urgent dispatch monitored in mexico 
city 
gorbachev had planned a threeday visit to cuba begining dec 9 
but canceled at the last minute after the devastating earthquake in 
soviet armenia 
cuba sent a relief team to the stricken area and said the 
invitation to gorbachev still was open 
there was no immediate announcement in moscow about rescheduling 
the visit and soviet sources have said the visit has been postponed 
indefinitely 
although cuban president fidel castro has made no secret of his 
disdain for gorbachevs reformist agenda the soviet leaders visit 
was to feature havanas grandest reception for a visiting dignitary 
at least 500000 people were expected to line the route of 
gorbachevs motorcade 
castros rejection of gorbachevs economic reforms which he said 
reek of capitalism have led to speculation about a rift between 
the soviet union and its closest ally in the western hemisphere 
cubas economic performance is poor and the island nation has 
been a financial drain on the soviets at a time when the kremlin is 
trying to channel resources to domestic needs castro also is 
unsympathetic to gorbachevs encouragement of more openness of 
expression 
gorbachev was widely expected to try to persuade castro to soften 
his opposition to the new political thinking in the soviet union 
we are not seeking to worsen our relations with cuba one 
latin american specialist at the kremlin said in december but 
gorbachev is a very persuasive man and he will try to explain his 
intentions 
the source said cuba has become an embarrassment as well as a 
financial drain on the soviet union castro is seen as an exporter 
of revolution a position that runs counter to new soviet thinking 
we are no longer supporting class wars or socialist revolution 
in latin america said the soviet specialist who spoke to the 
associated press in moscow on condition of anonymity

a republican fundraising letter signed by 
party chairman lee atwater criticizes a 50 percent congressional pay 
raise endorsed by former president reagan and president bush but a 
spokeswoman says it was all a mistake 
atwater is not opposed to the pay raise according to 
republican national committee spokeswoman leslie goodman who blamed 
the mistake on republican national committee staffers 
she said atwater had ordered changes in the letter including 
deletion of the two paragraphs of pay raise criticism but staff 
members failed to follow the directions 
the fivepage letter was mailed to prospective contributors and 
found its way into the hands of the democratic leaders 
the letter which appeals for donations and attacks democratic 
liberals went out before president bush endorsed the raise last 
friday calling it overdue but it apparently was written after 
former president reagan formally proposed the large raise in the 
budget he submitted to congress 
it also was mailed before the house republican leadership began 
negotiatons with house democratic leaders last week to allow the 
raise to become law feb 8 without a vote in return for a package of 
severe restrictions on outside income including a ban on speaking 
fees 
the letter tells prospective contributors theres also a move 
afoot to let congressmen enjoy yet another whopping pay raise in 
this kind of atmosphere how can president bush hope to keep your 
taxes low cut the budget deficit and keep prosperity growing across 
the land 
ms goodman said the letter was written while atwater was still 
heading the bush transition team and had not yet been formally 
inaugurated as rnc chairman 
she said it was prepared by republican party staffers under 
former rnc chairman frank j fahrenkopf jr adding it was a staff 
error it was one of those things that slipped atwaters new staff 
requested changes be made before the final version was made out 
this particular one was not 
the white house press office had no comment and referred a 
reporter to the republican national committee 
rankandfile lawmakers would have their salaries raised from 
89500 to 135000 unless both houses of congress vote to reject 
the increase federal judges and top executive branch political 
appointees also would receive 50 percent raises 
at a news conference on friday bush said a raise is overdue 
theres no question about that the reform of the honoraria payments 
for these speeches i think is very very good 
reagans recommendation to congress endorsed the proposal of a 
presidential commission lawmakers especially democrats were 
surprised that reagan did not reduce the amount as he could have 
done under the law 
house speaker jim wright dtexas reportedly has been upset that 
he has taken the brunt of public outrage against the size of the 
raise even after the two republican presidents endorsed it and the 
house gop leadership began negotiating with democrats on the 
financial reforms 
wright spokesman mark johnson said a high ranking member of 
the house democratic leadership whom he would not name complained 
to white house chief of staff john sununu about the letter 
we were subsequently told that atwater was informed of the 
presidents position on this issue johnson said we dont think 
any political effort by the rnc is going to go any further 
the house has taken more heat than the senate for the raise 
because house leaders do not plan to allow a vote the senate will 
have a vote probably meaningless that is almost certain to 
reject the increase 
last week the bipartisan house negotiators reached tentative 
agreement on the outlines of the reform package which would include 
the honoraria ban affecting speeches appearances and articles 
closing a loophole in federal law that has allowed 190 house members 
to stash away more than 39 million in surplus campaign money for 
their personal use limits on travel paid for by special interests 
and restrictions on nonhonoraria income 
majority whip tony coelho and rep vic fazio both dcalif have 
been negotiating the package with two republican counterparts gop 
whip dick cheney rwyo and jerry lewis rcalif

a police officer on saturday scouted a 
central utah site where serial killer ted bundy claimed before his 
execution that he buried one of his victims 
however bountiful police chief larry higgins said that as in 
the case of two unsuccessful forays friday at other locations a 
fullscale search for the remains of debi kent would have to wait 
until warmer weather 
in confessions sunday and early tuesday at florida state prison 
bundy used maps and descriptions to target areas where he buried the 
bodies of three women killed during the mid1970s while he studied 
law at the university of utah 
on friday searchers seeking the remains of 15yearold sue 
curtis were were frustrated by frozen ground and snow cover 
southeast of price lawmen in wayne county reported similar 
conditions near capital reef national park where bundy said he 
buried the body of 17yearold nancy wilcox 
however temperatures near capital reef in southcentral utah 
are generally warmer than the other two sites and wayne county chief 
deputy leon brinckerhoff said a search could begin within a week to 
10 days if the weather cooperates 
if weather permits and the snow melts we want to be right back 
in that area if theres a body there well find it he said 
brinckerhoff added that a rancher in the area remembered seeing a 
man wearing a suit and matching bundys description in the area in 
the mid1970s but didnt think to contact authorities until he 
heard of the execution 
higgins said his officer examined a stretch of us 89 between 
fairview and mayfield in hopes of narrowing the scope of a later 
search for kents remains 
all were really doing is checking out the information provided 
to us by bundy in regard to the location to see if we can locate 
approximately the site he said 
higgins said bundy supplied a detailed description of the 
gravesite but declined to discuss specifics 
were going to have to wait until spring he said but i 
think that weve got a pretty good chance for success and well 
make every effort to find debi kents remains 
in the days before his execution last tuesday bundy 42 
confessed to 23 killings but investigators suspect he may have 
committed more than 100 he has been linked to slayings in utah 
oregon idaho colorado florida vermont new jersey and 
pennsylvania 
bundy acknowledged involvement in eight utah killings and 
mentioned the names of kent last seen in a high school parking lot 
on nov 8 1975 and wilcox who vanished from the salt lake city 
suburb of holladay the previous october 
bundy also said he abducted a girl from the brigham young 
university campus in 1975 and buried her body near price in 
eastcentral utah investigators believe that victim was curtis who 
disappeared from a mormon youth conference at byu in june of that 
year 
but while bundy mentioned eight killings in utah authorities 
have been able to link him through evidence or confessions to only 
five 
besides kent curtis and wilcox investigators believe bundy also 
killed melissa smith 17 of midvale who disappeared oct 19 1974 
and laura ann aime of salem also 17 who vanished 12 days later 
their bodies were discovered in canyons of the wasatch range

yugoslavias premierdesignate ante 
markovic on saturday called for radical marketoriented reforms and 
a completly new type of socialism to overcome the countrys deep 
economic and social crisis 
i consider the openmarket economy to be an ultimate 
achievement of mankind for which no alternative has yet been 
found markovic said advocating closer links with the most 
developed european countries 
he also revealed that this communist country with inflation 
running more than 250 percent and stagnating economic growth is 
again unable to repay foreign debts 
the solution to our problems does not lie in cosmetic changes 
to the existing system markovic said in his speech on state 
television 
we should develop a completely new type of socialism in this 
country with maximum democracy freedom and political 
pluralism markovic said in his first public address since he was 
designated premier by the state presidency 
markovic said he accepted the premiership on the condition he 
have a free hand in choosing his cabinet 
he said it will take at least five years to consolidate his 
reforms 
markovic is formally to remain in office until the end of 
mikulics original fouryear mandate that expires in may 1990 the 
premier designate said he would need a full mandate to implement his 
economic plan 
markovic on march 1 is to succeed branko mikulic who resigned 
with his entire cabinet on dec 30 it was the first federal 
government to step down since the communists took power after world 
war ii 
mikulic resigned following his failure to solve the countrys 
numerous social and economic problems including a dramatic 
escalation of labor and ethnic unrest 
all 23 million citizens of yugoslavia should have a right to 
decide about the future of this country markovic said in a 
clear reference to the yugoslav communist party members who occupy 
all leading economic and political posts 
in may 1987 yugoslavia was unable to repay an installment of 
about 400 million of a shortterm foreign loan without giving 
details markovic said yugoslavia is now faced with a similar 
problem 
unless yugoslavia is able to increase its foreign currency 
earnings to between 25 billion and 28 billion a year within the 
next five years it will not be able to set aside 25 percent of 
that figure to repay its foreign debt and simultaneously ensure 
that its economy continues to function normally he disclosed 
at present the countrys foreign currency earnings are about 11 
billion annually it has to devote about 7 billion annually to 
service and repay its 21 billion foreign debt 
markovic said that joint ventures with foreign partners must have 
absolute priority 
he also called for an urgent introduction of shares and bonds 
private initiative and entrepreneurship in the yugoslav economy 
and an end to state interference in the running of businesses 
other reforms would include the reshaping the banking system 
along western lines creating a capital market and an end to state 
subsidies for moneylosing companies 
markovic said that yugoslav workers in profitable firms should be 
stimulated to work better through higher salaries because the 
impoverished worker is ready to destroy the current system

rescuers on saturday suspended their search for 
about 20 miners buried for a week in a sabotaged peruvian gold mine 
police said 
three miners have been found alive and six bodies have been 
recovered since a rescue began monday at the hillside mine near 
nazca 230 miles south of lima 
official sources now say no more than 30 miners were trapped and 
presumed dead after giving conflicting figures ranging from 15 to 
300 
nazca police said they suspended operations because rescuers were 
endangered by toxic fumes smoke from a stillburning fire and 
feeble tunnel supports that caused several new caveins during the 
week 
the government is evaluating whether to renew efforts after 20 
rescuers were treated for inhalation of smoke and toxic gas in the 
past week said police 
factions battling over a rich gold vein on jan 21 set ablaze 
timbers supporting tunnels and smoke prevented miners from escaping 
the sol de oro mine officials said flames ate through the beams 
and the mine collapsed monday further enclosing victims 
hope was revived briefly tuesday when rescuers reported tapping 
from cavedin tunnels but those sounds have not been heard since 
officials said it is impossible to know exactly how many people 
were trapped because about 900 farmers and other area residents have 
been working the mine independently for more than a year mining 
when and where they like without any control 
commercial mining was halted there 40 years ago because of 
falling profits officials said

president bush on saturday discussed the soviet 
union with former secretary of state henry kissinger and then warmed 
up for an allmale evening of humor by having lunch with a 
businessmens club 
kissinger back from a recent trip to the soviet union said 
leaders there are very relaxed toward the bush administration 
even though the president is calling for a goslow approach to 
expanding ties between the two nations 
kissinger shared his impressions of the soviet union with bush at 
their meeting saturday he said he said the soviets do not see 
bushs plan to review ussoviet policy as a bad sign and are not 
impatient for quick action 
i think they understand that a review has to be undertaken 
he said i have the impression that they have great confidence in 
president bush 
on his second weekend as president bush ventured out of the 
white house for lunch with members of the alibi club a few blocks 
away the club consists of about 50 businessmen and bush has long 
attended its friday lunches said press aide bruce zanca 
the event was switched from friday to saturday because most 
members were in town to attend the evenings annual jokefest with 
the allmale alfalfa club said zanca 
bush has attended the alfalfa dinner in the past along with 
former president reagan and a virtual whos who of administration 
officials business leaders and congressmen of both parties 
bush who in his campaign pledged to be an advocate for womens 
rights planned to attend in the tradition of past presidents 
said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
bushs plan to attend the allmale alfalfa club was criticized by 
ann lewis a womens activist and democratic political consultant 
she called the club an example of how women are excluded from 
chances to make business ties 
the 76yearold club permits no press coverage but the 
washington post in past years has compiled the speeches and ribald 
jokes as relayed by those on hand 
in 1987 members raved about the speech delivered by sen pete 
domenici rariz but sen barbara mikulski dmd was not amused 
domenici had quipped that women would throw their panties at him 
when he spoke on the campaign trail the post quoted him as saying 
it happened again just yesterday i dont know what got into 
senator mikulski 
by the time bush left the alibi club on i street about 100 
people had gathered across the street he gave a wave and they 
cheered 
meanwhile bushs motorcade kept up a new practice for casual 
drives of stopping at traffic lights in the past the procession 
has simply swept through while police halted ordinary motorists 
mrs bush caused a stir when she left the white house grounds 
saturday 
accompanied by about five companians and security personnel she 
decided to walk her english springer spaniel millie when she 
walked out to the front gate onto busy pennsylvania avenue she was 
chased by reporters and camera crews who had been waiting for 
kissinger 
im going for a walk she said as passersby stopped to stare 
im going to do this all the time 
she apparently had planned to cross the street to blair house 
where official white house guests usually stay informed that it was 
closed she turned and went back into the white house grounds 
mrs bush also was given a private tour of a national gallery of 
art showing of youthful works by french impressionist master paul 
cezanne the 57 paintings and 15 drawings the show opens to the 
public sunday 
bush on sunday planned to travel to the presidential retreat at 
camp david md and spend most of the day there 
the president was to be visited at camp david by house speaker 
jim wright dtexas said administration sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity one characterized the meeting as purely 
social and said wrights wife would drive to camp david with him 
since his election bush has made a point of friendly gestures 
toward congress in anticipation of a brewing storm over the federal 
budget the source however said no fiscal discussion was planned 
for the wright visit

those who saw the santa barbara oil spill 
blacken californias coast with sticky goo two decades ago still 
have a residue of bitterness environmental activism and mistrust 
of business and government 
it looked like the world was covered by oil recalled biology 
professor michael neushul of the university of california at santa 
barbara 
it was a shock it was horrible said james bud bottoms 
a sculptor and cofounder of get oil out better known as goo 
everybody stood along the beaches and cried because we thought our 
environment was finished 
goo scheduled a saturday night dinner at the montecito country 
club to commemorate the big spill created when an offshore oil well 
blew out in the santa barbara channel on jan 28 1969 
barry lane a spokesman for unocal corp named union oil co of 
california when well a21 on platform a blew out said the accident 
5 miles south of santa barbara was not a pleasant experience for 
the company 
lane agreed with drilling foes that the accident which saw 
oildrenched birds and beaches televised nationwide and spurred an 
eightyear drilling moratorium off santa barbara helped spur the 
environmental movement 
it was a social disaster it was a governmental disaster 
neushul said it was an industrial responsibility disaster it was 
the beginning of the environmental movement 
yet unocal and its critics still disagree over the amount of oil 
spilled the extent of damage and the likelihood that improvements 
in drilling technology spurred by the spill will prevent another 
such accident 
the spill spewed more than 325 million gallons of oil over 800 
square miles of water covered 100 miles of coastline and beaches 
with a thick tarry black goo smothered thousands of birds fish 
and other sea life and helped trigger a new age of environmental 
awareness a california coastal commission news release said last 
week 
tallies by neushul and his students concluded the spill killed 
9000 birds 88 million barnacles 30000 mussels and 51800 
limpets but they were unable to prove significant numbers of deaths 
among fish whales elephant seals sea lions or plankton he said 
the truth is that it was not an ecological disaster neushul 
said 
lane said unocals best estimate is that 420000 to 840000 
gallons of oil spilled and 30 miles of coastline were covered with 
oil lawsuits stemming from the spill resulted in settlements 
totaling about 16 million he added 
a number of scientific studies make it pretty clear as to what 
the ecological impact was and that is nothing lane said 
others disagreed 
if that was not an ecological disaster there is no such thing 
as an ecological disaster replied goos current president lawyer 
robert hopps 
when the spill happened despite federal and oil company 
assurances to the contrary local residents were furious 
government was taken in by the big oil companies no question 
about that said former goo president and exstate sen alvin 
weingand now 84 
we dont trust our government as much as we used to which is 
great neushul said it means they dont lie to us quite as 
much 
but lane said the spill had a tremendous impact on improving 
drilling technology to make wells more controllable led to improved 
training for oil platform workers and made oil companies averse to 
taking any risks 
unocal district production superintendent jim grimes said that 
since the spill there have been over 900 wells drilled offshore 
california and theres not been another incident like this 
somewhere along the line there should be some confidence we can 
drill without having a disaster 
others are less confident 
with nearly two dozen oil platforms in the santa barbara channel 
today we all live in fear and anticipation that one will be hit 
by a tanker or another blowout bottoms said its like having a 
monster it is a monster a giant oil monster

rebels fired rockets into kabul on 
saturday as more soviet soldiers left the country and a guerrilla 
leader said warplanes bombed villages and killed hundreds to clear a 
path for the red armys withdrawal 
soviet defense minister dmitri t yazov discussed moscows 
withdrawal plans with president najib and other afghan officials on 
friday and saturday in kabul the official soviet news agency tass 
reported 
under a united nations accord the soviets have until feb 15 to 
end their nineyear intervention in afghanistan but diplomats who 
requested anonymity told the associated press the withdrawal should 
be completed within a week 
iran which serves as a refuge for more than 1 million afghans 
said its embassy will remain open and workers on saturday erected 
halfinchthick steel plates around the embassys eightfoot walls 
other moslem and middle eastern countries began planning for 
increased security around their embassies in the besieged capital 
this is not just a concern of the western nations said one 
moslem diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity we could 
count on the soviets for security now we have to figure out what we 
will do when theyve gone 
the soviets have said they intend to keep their mission open but 
moscows east bloc allies were considering closing most 
noncommunist nations have ordered their diplomats to leave 
afghanistan by saturday 
west germany closed its mission a week ago the first nation to 
do so the united states announced thursday that it would withdraw 
its diplomats and britain japan france and austria followed suit 
at a news conference in islamabad the pakistani capital 
burhanuddin rabbani chief of the jamiatiislami guerrilla group 
accused the soviets of sending warplanes into afghanistan to bomb 
villages 
the bombing has been very severe for the last three days 
leaving hundreds of casualties and destroying dozens of villages 
he said 
rabbani appealed to un secretarygeneral javier peres de 
cuellar to stop the destruction 
villages along the strategic 260mile salang highway which leads 
to kabul from the soviet border were among the targets rabbani 
said the road is the main land route for the red armys withdrawal 
western diplomats reported thursday that soviets and the elite 
afghan special guard bombed and shelled villages on the northern and 
southern ends of salang highway on monday 
they quoted eyewitnesses as saying that hundreds of civilians 
were killed in those attacks the area is dominated by guerrilla 
commander ahmad shah masood who belongs to rabbanis group 
the guerrillas backed by the united states and pakistan have 
been fighting the afghan government since a marxist coup in 1978 
they are not a party to the un agreement and are expected to close 
in on najibs government once the soviet withdrawal is complete 
for their part the guerrillas have continued to rocket kabul and 
other major cities they fired four rockets into the capital 
saturday said a un official who requested anonymity he said no 
one was killed in the shelling 
the governments troops fired eight missiles into hills 
surrounding the city there were no reports of casualties 
two soviet military transport planes carrying about 60 passengers 
each flew out of kabul on saturday helicopter gunships escorted the 
aircraft over the snowcovered hills and the planes dropped a 
cascade of flares designed to deflect heatseeking missiles fired by 
the guerrillas 
other soviet transport planes airlifted emergency food and fuel 
to the embattled city 
convoys tailed by tanks hauled flour to silos and fuel to 
gasoline stations where lines as long as a halfmile began forming 
before dawn 
shortages have eased since the soviet airlift began last week 
but many afghans some wearing only light cotton clothing and 
sandals waited for hours in freezing weather for bread and 
gasoline many went home without either

the united nations should arbitrarily set a 
date for resuming persian gulf peace talks despite objections from 
iran iraqs foreign minister said saturday 
tariq aziz called on the un officials to pressure iran into 
returning to the negotiating table 
the secretarygeneral and his personal representative are 
dutybound now to fix a date for resuming the peace talks at a date 
which they find appropriate and they should not allow iran to put 
any preconditions on resumption of talks aziz said according to 
the official iraqi news agency 
tariq aziz comments came at the end of the first day of talks 
with a team of un officials headed by special envoy jan eliasson 
who arrived from tehran friday on a mission to revive the stalled 
negotations 
a spokesman for the un delegation gianni picco would not 
comment on the content of saturdays discussions or say whether the 
facetoface negotiations would resume soon 
we are working to make progress in implementing un resolution 
598 he said referring to the security council resolution that 
outlined a ceasefire and peace treaty in the 8year gulf war 
we will leave no stone unturned in trying to achieve that he 
added 
a unsponsored ceasefire in the gulf war took effect aug 20 
but peace talks that began five days later in geneva broke down 
immediately over the issue of troop withdrawals to prewar borders 
two further rounds of negotiations brought no progress and no 
date was set for them to resume 
earlier this week eliasson held four days of talks in iran with 
officials there 
iran has demanded that before the peace talks resume the two 
sides should agree to full implementation of resolution 598 
including the troop withdrawals 
the un resolution calls on iran and iraq to halt all military 
activities and honor the truce withdraw troops to prewar 
borders exchange around 100000 prisoners of war and start peace 
talks 
iran has accused baghdad of blocking a peace agreement by 
refusing to withdraw from iranian territory but iraq says it will 
not pull out until iran gives up the right to search iraqbound 
ships in the gulf for war cargo

sinhalese extremists shot and killed a 
candidate for next months parliament election bringing to 10 the 
number of candidates slain this month officials said saturday 
punchibanda ratnayake was shot to death friday night in welimadu 
about 75 miles east of colombo police said speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
ratnayake a sinhalese was a member of the opposition sri lanka 
freedom party 
a senior election department official said 10 candidates for the 
feb 15 parliamentary elections have been killed since nominations 
closed jan 6 
police had put the total at 10 before ratnayake was killed but 
the election official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
that was incorrect 
he said six of the slain candidates belonged to the freedom 
party two to the leftist united socialist alliance one to 
president ranasinghe premadasas governing united national party and 
one to the sri lanka tamil congress party 
seven of the victims were sinhalese two were tamils and one was 
moslem 
police blamed the latest killing and most of the others on the 
peoples liberation front an extremist sinhalese group however 
they said two tamil candidates killed in the northern jaffna region 
were victims of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam a separatist 
guerrilla group that has been fighting the government since 1983 
both the tigers and the peoples liberation front have vowed to 
disrupt the elections for the 225seat parliament 
police said the front has killed more than 60 people most of 
them political party supporters in the last three days 
the tigers have rejected the governments offer of partial 
autonomy for northern and eastern sri lanka where most tamils live 
the tigers are seeking an independent homeland for their ethnic 
minority 
the peoples liberation front started attacking the government 
and other sinhalese politicians last year saying too many 
concessions were being made to the tamil minority 
sinhalese make up about 75 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people and dominate the government and military tamils comprise 
about 18 percent and say they are discriminated against by the 
sinhalese 
most tamils are hindus and most sinhalese are buddhists 
the moslems who claim descent from arab traders account for 
about 7 percent of the population 
there is also a tiny christian minority consisting of 
descendants of european colonists and converts among the sinhalese 
and tamil communities

iranian president ali khamenei deplored 
the plight of women in western society on saturday and said their 
real rights are safeguarded only by islam the official islamic 
republic news agency reported 
in stark contrast to the honor and respect accorded to women in 
islam the west has degraded women to the meanest level the news 
agency quoted khamenei as saying 
the agency monitored in nicosia quoted him as saying that women 
in the west have been reduced to mere objects of pleasure 
despite alleged strides toward achieving equal rights 
the iranian president was speaking at the opening of a seminar on 
women held to mark the anniversary of the birth of fatima daughter 
of the prophet mohammed who founded the islamic faith 
khamenei criticized the western culture of permissiveness and 
nudity which gives man a free rein to exploit and insult womans 
personality the agency said 
despite official claims that under the islamic regime iranian 
women enjoy more rights than ever women are still considered 
secondclass citizens in iran and are strictly segregated from men 
in public 
one of the first decrees of the islamic revolution that overthrew 
the westernoriented government of the late shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi 10 years ago was that women should cover themselves from 
head to foot in public 
irans revolutionary leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini also 
reduced the legal age for women to marry from 18 to 13 soon after 
coming to power in 1979 
the tradition of siqeh a form of legalized prostitution 
which was frowned on by the shah and is condoned by the islamic 
government has become common practice in iran 
permitted by shiite islam the largest breakaway sect from the 
orthodox sunni islam the practice of siqeh allows a temporary 
marriage of a night a week a month or a year between men and 
women 
under islam a man is also allowed four wives but a woman is 
only allowed one husband

two nazi war criminals freed after 
43 years of imprisonment in the netherlands were indirectly 
responsible for sending anne frank to the death camps a historian 
said saturday 
but there is no direct link between the dutch jewish girl who 
died in the bergenbelsen concentration camp and the two germans 
said loe de jong considered the nations foremost authority on 
world war ii 
franz fischer 87 and 79yearold ferdinand aus der fuenten were 
deported to west germany on friday the two were highranking nazi 
officials responsible for sending thousands of dutch jews to their 
deaths during world war ii 
only 6000 of the netherlands 150000 jews survived nazi 
persecution 
the group that arrested the frank family in amsterdam 
operated under the command of aus der fuenten and aus der fuenten 
worked under the instructions of fischer de jong told the 
associated press 
it would be correct to say they had indirect responsibility 
for anne franks fate 
de jong is the author of the 14volume history of the kingdom 
of the netherlands in world war ii a governmentcommissioned 
study 
anne frank and her family were arrested by a german police unit 
known as the green police in august 1944 and were first deported to 
the auschwitz death camp in naziheld poland 
anne later was moved to the bergenbelsen concentration camp in 
germany where she died of pneumonia in 1945 at age 15 
from june 1942 until her arrest anne wrote her diary as the 
franks hid in a secret section of an amsterdam canal house closed 
off from the rest of the building by a bookshelf 
the book perhaps the most famous personal document to come out 
of the holocaust was published in 1947 and was turned into a play 
and movie 
fischer ran the haguebased jewish section of the nazi security 
service ss in that capacity he gave guidelines about which 
jews should be rounded up de jong said 
aus der fuenten an ss administrator who ran what was cynically 
called the central directorate for jewish emigration oversaw the 
deportations of thousands of jews from amsterdam rotterdam and the 
hague 
fischer and aus der fuenten were sentenced to death in 1950 but 
their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment a year later 
they were the worlds only war criminals who had been jailed 
since world war ii according to the government which said keeping 
them here any longer would violate the principle of equality before 
the law 
the netherlands has pardoned and freed 107 other war criminals 
who had been sentenced to death

congress is poised to put president bushs 
pledge of bipartisanship to the test as it tackles the years 
overarching foreignpolicy dilemma how to be a world power on a 
limited budget 
along with an agenda that includes placing new curbs on chemical 
warfare escalating the war on drugs around the world and keeping 
an eye on hot spots from central america to the middle east and 
southern africa congress may try to shoehorn growing us financial 
obligations into a shrinking foreign aid bill 
that would be very dangerous in my judgment said rep dante 
fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign affairs committee 
you obviously reduce the influence of the united states theres a 
limit to the influence you can exert without money 
us policymakers have long found direct foreign aid among the 
best tools for extending american influence abroad and encouraging 
behavior friendly to american interests 
persuasion is good but there comes a point where you have to 
discuss programs fascell said in a recent interview we are at 
the very bottom limit it affects posts abroad morale the way 
other nations look at us 
on the other hand foreign aid bills do not enjoy much popularity 
in congress because voters generally are not keen on sending us 
tax dollars to other countries 
some of the money goes for economic development and humanitarian 
aid some 52 billion in the current fiscal year a larger amount 
77 billion is classified as security assistance and includes 
grants of weaponry 
but a severe financial squeeze is on the horizon bush and 
congressional leaders have promised an array of potentially 
expensive new domestic programs from fighting drugs to alleviating 
homelessness at a time of severe budget constraints 
in the foreign aid area an increase in the flow of refugees 
worldwide new united nations peacekeeping forces in southern 
african and afghanistan and new commitments to countries like the 
philippines where the united states maintains military bases will 
put other aid programs into the budget vise 
it is up to fascells committee its senate counterpart and the 
house and senate appropriations committees to design programs and 
policies that will fit into the new downsized budget a process 
that is bound to be painful and strain bipartisanship 
one possible avenue is to emphasize punishments rather than 
rewards in seeking to influence other nations behavior but there 
is broad disagreement on how well economic diplomatic or trade 
sanctions work 
fascell pointed out the drug problem as an example current us 
law calls for the president to certify annually and for congress to 
accept that countries on a state department list of 
drugtrafficking and producing points are fully cooperating with 
antidrug efforts 
such certifications have been hotly debated in the past and 
decertification action even if only threatened has damaged 
relations with friendly countries while pursuing one goal the drug 
war objectives of economic and political stability are lost 
fascell said the certification system may need to be revamped 
and the united states may need to assume more of the responsibility 
for its drug problem 
we cant blame others for our problems he said were the 
problem it isnt them it is affecting our foreign policy 
capability we have to rethink how much of a sanction you can put on 
another government 
among other problems likely to be high on congress foreign 
affairs agenda this year 
ussoviet relations lawmakers are of two minds some worry 
that bush will move too slowly and forfeit opportunities for further 
arms control progress under the moderate leadership of mikhail 
gorbachev others fear that gorbachev is merely taking a breather 
before resuming expansionist policies and that he may be seeking to 
split the nato alliance 
war powers congress and the white house will continue their 
long battle over who has the power to commit us troops to world 
hot spots i can almost guarantee you that unless we find an 
answer the hope and desire of both of us to have a bipartisan 
foreign policy is going to be impossible sen joseph biden 
ddel a member of the foreign relations committee said at a 
recent confirmation hearing for secretary of state james a baker 
iii 
the spread of chemical weapons several members of congress have 
vowed to press for legislation that would penalize companies that 
sell equipment used to produce chemical weapons and to impose 
sanctions on governments that use produce or store poison gases or 
biological weapons 
central america the focus is likely to shift from nicaragua 
where the new bush team seems to be taking a less confrontational 
approach toward the leftist sandinista government to el salvador 
which holds a presidential election in march the rightwing arena 
party which already controls the countrys legislature and in the 
past has been linked with deathsquad activity is heavily favored 
to win the presidency 
panama it has been a year since ruler manuel antonio noriega 
was indicted by a us grand jury on drug charges but sanctions 
have apparently not loosened his grip on the country a 1991 
deadline looms for us approval of a native panamanian commissioner 
for the canal complicated by continued bad relations between the 
two countries 
environmental issues a growing group of senators want to put 
environmental protection on the world agenda hoping to create 
multilateral forums to discuss issues like global warming acid rain

government banned in 1988

a hundred haitian cane 
cutters were crammed like animals into a truck driven by a 
drunken man who drove the vehicle off a cliff survivors said 
saturday the crash killed 48 people 
the central workers union and the majority workers center 
denounced the brutal treatment of haitian cane cutters and accused 
the government of practicing slavery 
officials said it was the worst traffic accident ever in the 
dominican republic which shares the caribbean island of hispaniola 
with haiti 
the truck plunged from a cliff early friday about 22 miles north 
of santo domingo those killed included six children and three women 
in an interview published saturday by the santo domingo newspaper 
ultima hora one of the haitian survivors manuel yang said the 
haitians were recruited near the border by a dominican 
trafficker and smuggled to a military barracks in the dominican 
border town of dajabon 
after being kept prisoners for two days two tall men and two 
soldiers took us out he told the newspaper we were fed and 
loaded on a truck like animals 
ultimo hora quoted yang as saying the truck driver told the 
haitians if they gave him money to buy rum they would not be taken 
to cut cane but rather would be taken someplace else whre there was 
better work 
police on saturday were still looking for the driver survivors 
said he had been drinking when he missed a curve shortly after 
midnight friday and flung himself from the truck which rolled down 
a hill 
red cross workers and soldiers found more than 20 bodies trapped 
under the overturned truck 10 hours after the accident others were 
sprawled around the area 
the 36 people injured were being treated at santo domingo 
hospitals 
every year dominicans recruit about 19000 poor haitians at low 
wages for the tortuous work of cutting sugar cane the backbone of 
the countrys economy 
amnesty international and the international organization of labor 
have accused the dominican government of practicing slavery with 
haitian cane cutters 
before haitian dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled into exile in 
1986 he received more than 1 million a year from the dominicans in 
exchange for haitian cane cutters a practice widely condemned by 
international human rights groups

a group of angolan government troops was 
decimated in early january while setting up a monitoring post in 
southern angola near the namibian border the lisbon newspaper 
reported saturday 
the weekly expresso said the troops were attacked while setting 
up one of the posts designed to monitor an aug 8 ceasefire between 
angola and south africa along the border 
the paper said its information was firsthand from luanda but 
named no sources 
following the attack angola established intense diplomatic 
contacts with south africa to find out the cause of the incident 
but pretoria denied its forces were involved expresso said 
the rebel national union for the total independence of angola 
also has not claimed responsibility for the attack in its regular 
statements issued in lisbon 
angolan officials have accused south africa of continuing to 
supply the rebels through the unpatrolled border section 
pretoria claims the area allows activists of the south west 
african peoples organization to slip in and out of namibia 
the angolan rebels have their main jamba base about 19 miles from 
the namibian border and claim control of the region 
they have warned repeatedly that hostile forces found in the 
area including members of a 10nation un monitoring force would 
be attacked 
angolan military officials have said they would have to send an 
armed contingent into the unpatrolled area to oust the rebels but 
that would allow south africa to accuse them of violating the 
ceasefire agreement 
the agreement states there can be no substantial troop movements 
on either side of the border 
expresso did not say whether the attacked troops formed part of a 
military operation against the angolan rebels 
under accords signed dec 22 in new york by angola cuba and 
south africa pretoria pledged to cease aid to the angolan rebels 
and to give independence to namibia 
in return angola promised to end support to african nationalist 
activists and cuba agreed to withdraw 50000 troops that supported 
angolas marxist government in its fight against the rebels

industry minister ariel sharon said saturday 
there will be no peace in the middle east as long as yasser arafat 
runs around alive and that israel must do more to counteract the 
plo leaders peace initiative 
sharons comments in an interview with israel radio reflected a 
personal opinion that arafat should be killed his spokesman 
moshe behagon told the associated press he says many times that 
if it were possible he would want to kill him 
also saturday defense minister yitzhak rabin said us officials 
support his peace plan that includes elections in the occupied 
territories in exchange for a ceasefire in the palestinan uprising 
israel television reported 
one palestinian protester was reported fatally shot in the 
territories saturday arab news reports said at least 10 people 
including a boy either were shot and wounded or beaten in clashes 
between soldiers and stonethrowers in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
the army confirmed four woundings by plastic bullets 
the death raised to 370 the number of palestinians killed in the 
nearly 14monthold uprising fifteen israelis also have died 
sharons remarks come amid growing debate over the nations 
policy toward the palestine liberation organization and israels 
response to the 13month palestinian uprising in the occupied 
territories 
as long as arafat runs around alive around us there will never 
be peace sharon said no arab leader will be ready to meet with 
us for fear for his life and no palestinian will be ready to talk 
because if he does so while arafat is alive his fate is sealed 
sharon seemed to be alluding to repeated threats from leaders of 
the plosupported uprising against palestinians who cooperate with 
the israelis more than a dozen alleged collaborators have been 
killed during the uprising 
once the nations defense minister sharon was forced from the 
post in 1983 after israels militia allies in lebanon massacred 
palestinians in beirut 
israel denounces the plo as terrorists and refuses to talk with 
it the nation protested bitterly when the united states opened 
talks with the plo last month but there are growing calls for 
israel to change its policy 
rabin a leader of the labor party said he has won support from 
leading us officials for a peace plan he published last week that 
offers elections in the territories in exchange for a ceasefire in 
the uprising israel television reported 
the plan has been rejected by both the plo and underground 
leaders of the uprising in the west bank and gaza strip 
but the television quoted rabin as telling a reporter that us 
officials have indicated that the plan was a possible basis for 
a settlement to the palestinian issue 
however sharon said any attempt in or out of the government 
that tries to explain why we should speak to the plo only paves the 
way for and lends legitimacy to other governments to talk to 
arafat 
arafat began his latest peace initiative in december when he said 
the plo renounced terrorism and recognized israel last week he 
traveled to spain where he was received for the first time by 
western european leaders 
israel radio said a 23yearold died after troops shot him in a 
west bank village near bethlehem the army confirmed the death but 
said it was investigating the circumstances and gave no other 
details 
two other palestinians were wounded in the same clash in the 
village of sureif while two others were wounded in a village near 
the west bank city of nablus the army said 
two palestinian teenagers from the balata refugee camp near 
nablus were also treated for beating injuries to the face said the 
reports and an official at al ittihad hospital in nablus 
at least four other woundings occurred in gaza arab news reports 
said the army confirmed three including that of a 3yearold boy 
from plastic bullets fired at stonethrowing protesters

the government is likely to shed its 
peoples republic designation and adopt its precommunist coat 
of arms the hungarian state news agency mti reported 
a parliamentary committee rewriting the constitution is 
considering the move as well as including human rights provisions 
and political reform in the document that will likely be approved by 
a voter referendum the news agency said late friday 
members of the panel said it was quite superfluous to add 
epithets such as democratic or socialist to the designation 
republic of hungary in a new constitution now being prepared 
mti said friday 
hungarys present official name is magyar nepkoeztarsasag or 
hungarian peoples republic that name will be changed in the new 
constitution mti said 
lawyers on the committee argued the constitution not the 
designation of the state should reflect the democratic and 
socialist system in hungary the news agency said 
lawmakers also proposed that the first chapter of the 
constitution should lay down human rights and obligations mti 
reported 
several deputies said a coat of arms including the st stephens 
crown which is kept in parliament would be the most suitable 
symbol of statehood while others favored the kossuth coat of arms 
which does not contain the crown 
the current hungarian coat of arms was fashioned after the soviet 
model featuring two sheaves forming a circle 
the kossuth coat of arms was used for a while in the wake of the 
1848 uprising against hapsburg rule 
constitutional committee members agreed that the prime minister 
should in future be elected by parliament and be obliged to 
introduce his government to the chamber mti said 
they also supported the idea that the president of the republic 
should have genuine powers but he should not be entitled to dissolve 
parliament because a strong presidential system might lead toward a 
personality cult 
mti quoted justice minister kalman kulcsar as saying that the 
draft of the constitution would be discussed by various 
organizations including alternative groups outside the ruling 
communist party in the coming weeks 
after going before the partys policysetting central committee 
and then parliament on march 8 the text of the constitution will be 
completed by june 8 presented for public debate in the second 
half of the year and again submitted to parliament in december this 
year 
if parliament approves the new constitution it will most 
probably be subject to a referendum mti said

a newspaper report that britain will withdraw more 
than half its troops from gibraltar was described by the ministry of 
defense on saturday as speculative 
early editions of the sunday times said the government would pull 
more than 1000 troops out of the british colony and shut down many 
military facilities there 
it said the foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe would announce 
a study to review british defense commitments during a visit to 
gibraltar on monday 
the paper said defense ministry and foreign office sources 
confirmed a decision had been made to withdraw the troops more 
than half the 1900 british forces based there 
a ministry of defense spokesman said saturday night this 
report is speculative force levels are kept under constant review 
when ministers come to a decision on any change we will make an 
announcement 
the sunday times quoted a ministry of defense source as saying 
now that spain is a member of nato there are insufficient 
military reasons to maintain such a large presence which costs a 
lot of money 
british control of gibraltar is a highly sensitive issue between 
britain and spain which claims that the 22 square mile colony at 
the southern tip of the iberian peninsula is rightfully spanish 
britain which was ceded gibraltar in the 1713 treaty of utrecht 
has used it as a base for nearly 300 years currently for troop 
training and munition stores as well as for an airport dockyards 
and a navy base 
the colonys 28700 inhabitants have made clear they wish

a plo official on saturday 
urged the united states to upgrade its talks with the palestinian 
group and perhaps move the discussions to washington 
we believe the dialogue must be on a higher level that is if 
we wanted to be serious mahmoud abbas a palestine liberation 
organization executive committee member said in an interview with 
the associated press 
abbas also known by his guerrilla codename of abu mazen said 
the plo is trying to upgrade the level of the dialogue and to have 
it held in other places 
asked about alternative venues he saidsuch as washington 
in washington on friday president bush said that it was too 
soon to consider moving usplo contacts to a higher level 
former president reagan in december assigned the american 
ambassador to tunisia robert pelletreau jr to open the dialogue 
the plo has its headquarters in tunis 
the move ended a 13year american ban on contacts with the plo 
the ban was lifted after plo chief yasser arafats explicit 
recognition in december of israels right to exist and his 
renunciation of terrorism 
abbas said the plo leadership had asked pelletreau to fix a date 
for the next uspalestinian meeting which would be the first 
under the bush presidency 
he said that when the issue of terrorism came up at the first 
dialogue session the plo said it was against attacks on civilians 
outside the israelioccupied territories and against killing 
civilians inside the occupied territories the crime committed daily 
by the israeli forces against the palestinian people 
abbas added but our resistance against the israeli military 
occupation will continue and will not be suspended 
he was referring to the 13monthold uprising by 17 million 
palestinians in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip

defending government troops ran out of 
ammunition and abandoned a southern sudanese town besieged by rebels 
for more than nine months the armys general command said saturday 
the army statement said more than 1700 army and rebel troops 
were killed or wounded in the 37week siege of nasir in upper nile 
region 
the statement said the government troops were forced to withdraw 
after bad weather stopped airdrops of muchneeded ammunition and 
supplies since the siege started army aircraft have been dropping 
supplies over the town and bombing rebel camps around it 
in addis ababa sudan peoples liberation organization spokesman 
lam akol said the rebels had captured the strategic town after 
seven days of intensive fighting and that they were in full control 
of the garrison town 
people are now rejoicing and dancing in the streets of the 
city akol said 
six other government garrisons fell in recent months in each 
case the army explained the loss as a tactical withdrawal of its 
forces 
nasir is about 500 miles south of khartoum and 20 miles from 
sudans border with ethiopia which has aided the rebels with 
weapons money and facilities since the uprising began in 1983 
nasirs loss is a major blow to the beleaguered sudanese armys 
war effort western military sources said late last year that in 
rebel hands nasir would become a springboard for attacks on central 
and western upper nile 
the army statement said the sudanese armed forces decided to 
withdraw its troops from nasir effective yesterday friday after 
they ran out of ammunition and it became impossible for them to 
defend the town any further 
it became totally impossible to supply the town with equipment 
and men 
more than 1000 outlaw forces government jargon for bush 
fighters of the sudan peoples liberation army were killed or 
wounded during the siege the statement said it put government 
losses at more than 100 soldiers killed and more than 600 wounded 
army dead included col mahjoub mohammed moussa commander of the 
nasir garrison whose plane crashed last week the statement 
said without giving details neither did it specify whether the 
plane was shot by rebels 
the rebel broadcast from ethiopia claimed that moussa was 
captured when his men fled during the one hour of storm attack 
that finally took nasir spla forces are now in hot pursuit of the 
remnants who fled in disarray in different directions the 
broadcast said 
renegade army col john garang formed the guerrilla army and 
launched his rebellion against the moslemdominated central 
government in early 1983 
rebel operations cover all southern sudans three regions of 
equatoria bahr elghazal and upper nile inhabited mostly by 
christians and animists garang wants economic and administrative 
reforms in the south

nasa said saturday it probably will 
replace at least two of the three liquid oxygen turbopumps on 
discoverys main engines a move that could delay the shuttles late 
february launch until march 
a decision will be made before discovery is rolled out to the 
launch pad a move scheduled for thursday national aeronautics and 
space administration spokeswoman lisa malone said 
it is very likely we will pull at least two of the pumps she 
said 
sources reported that replacing two pumps could mean a delay of 
10 or more days in the planned feb 23 launch 
the problem stems from the december flight of shuttle atlantis 
postflight inspection of atlantis engines disclosed two tiny 
cracks in a bearing assembly in one of the turbopumps engineers 
determined they were caused by stress corrosion apparently 
resulting from moisture that penetrated the metal during the curing 
process 
extensive analysis has not revealed the source of the moisture 
because two of discoverys pumps may have been processed in the same 
manner as the faulty atlantis unit nasa is leaning toward replacing 
them with new carefully inspected pumps 
the third pump may be removed as a precaution miss malone said 
such engine work usually is done when the shuttle is in the 
horizontal position in a processing facility but discovery was 
mated last week with its booster rockets and external fuel tank and 
the turbopump replacement would have to be done while the craft is 
in the vertical position 
technicians have been working on new procedures to do the work in 
that position 
too long a delay in discoverys launch could affect the 
subsequent atlantis mission which is to dispatch a probe to the 
planet venus on april 28 discovery would have to be off the only 
shuttle launch pad by about march 14 if nasa is to maintain the 
april date 
discovery is to carry a crew of five astronauts who are to deploy 
a communications satellite and conduct scientific and medical 
experiments

for a week the owners of pixie a 
normally playful puppy didnt know why she had slowed down and 
would whine anytime she was picked up the answer came when a 
veterinarian removed the 7inch long serrated steak knife the dog 
had somehow swallowed 
if i had known a knife was in her i would have freaked said 
owner tony strollo 
the english bulldoggerman shepherd mix was less than 2 months 
old and weighed just over 10 pounds when she wolfed down the knife 
probably on jan 14 
the knife apparently fell on the floor during a meal and nobody 
noticed strollos wife barbara said no one that is except 
pixie 
teeth marks found later on the knife testify to the fact the 
puppy gnawed at it before she swallowed it 
dr jo ann helm a veterinarian who found and surgically removed 
the utensil jan 21 said the knife lay neatly packaged down pixies 
throat with the handle pushing down on the stomach 
the first signs that something was wrong came when the pup tried 
to cough something up but nothing happened 
then pixie started acted funny she couldnt coordinate her front 
legs and she would give a tiny yelp when people picked her up the 
strollos said 
a first trip to the vet revealed nothing xrays were taken on a 
return visit and clearly showed the knife 
dogs swallow anything pantyhose balls sticks ms helm 
said just like a young human child a puppy explores with its 
mouth

thousands supporting a 
communistdominated trade union marched through the capital saturday 
protesting a labor law package proposed by the centerright 
government that would permit more layoffs 
the estimated 20000 demonstrators waving banners and chanting 
slogans dating from the countrys 1974 leftist revolution filed 
slowly along downtown lisbons main boulevard avenida da liberdade 
and into rossio central square 
they called for an eighthour reduction in the present 48hour 
working week and a 135percent increase in the national minimum 
salary recently hiked to around 200 per month 
the general confederation of portuguese workers cgtp 
portugals most powerful union organized the march and other 
gatherings across the country against laws they claim would allow 
employers to hire and fire at will and deprive workers of job 
security by the spread of temporary contracts 
anibal cavaco silvas social democratic government says the laws 
are necessary that allow employers to dismiss workers for economic 
reasons in order to streamline the work force in portugals 
laborintensive and statedominated economy 
a socialistinspired constitution adopted after the 1974 
revolution currently makes it difficult for employers to dismiss 
workers 
unions and employers associations were initially slated to sign 
an accord on the package monday but the signing was called off as 
neither side could agree to final terms 
the socialistassociated general union of workers ugt had 
worked out an agreement with the government but it was later 
rejected by employers 
both ugt and cgtp unions also object to a wages and prices 
proposal based on what they see as unrealistic government forecasts 
on inflation and have threatened a general strike if no acceptable 
labor package can be found 
the government based last years wage claims on an inflation 
prediction of around 6 percent inflation nearly hit an annualized 
10 percent at the end of december 
cavaco silva points out portugals growth rate of an estimated 
42 percent in 1988 is almost double the european economic community 
average and a 6 percent unemployment rate is relatively low for eec 
standards

legal political wing said the ira killed an exceptional and 
regrettable number of civilians last year 
but gerry adams president of the sinn fein party told 600 
delegates to the annual party convention that his rebuke did not 
mean he was condemning the outlawed ira and its armed struggle to 
end british rule in northern ireland

saturday and two others injured in a bombing attack near the irish 
republic border 
and in london an estimated 2000 demonstrators marked the 17th 
anniversary of bloody sunday when british soldiers fatally shot 
14 people during a roman catholic civil rights protest in northern 
ireland 
sinn fein supports the mainly roman catholic iras fight to unite 
the province with the republic but even some ira supporters have 
criticized the group for blunders that killed at least 20 civilians 
in the past 14 months 
adams earlier this year told the ira to get its house in 
order after one of its bombs killed two of his roman catholic 
constituents in west belfast 
since the last convention there has been an exceptional and 
regrettable level of civilian casualties and fatalities arising from 
ira operations adams said in a keynote speech at dublins mansion 
house 
our dismay our regret and our sympathy with the plight of 
families bereaved by the ira is genuine he said 
martin mcguinness a member of sinn feins national executive 
committee told the conference the ira is trying to resolve the 
issue 
he said the ira dissolved one of its units to punish it after a 
november bombing in enniskillen in which 11 civilians were killed 
earlier senior party official danny morrison said sinn fein may 
set up pirate radio stations in the province to circumvent a 
government ban on interviews with its members news reports said 
sinn fein commands about onethird of the catholic vote in 
northern ireland and won seats on 17 of the countrys 26 local 
authorities in the last elections in 1985 the next local elections 
are in may

policemen were driving down the main street of the village when 
someone standing in the doorway of a pub signaled for them to stop 
not realizing it was an ambush the policemen halted their car 
and one got out to investigate an assailant then threw a bomb at 
the car from the roof of a nearby building wrecking the car police 
said 
one officer died and another was badly hurt in the blast a third 
was injured when scores of people spilling out of a nearby nightspot 
pelted him with bottles as he tried to aid his injured colleagues 
the noisy crowd also attacked army and police arriving on the 
scene but the group was dispersed when reinforcements fired rubber 
bullets police said 
police said the march in london went extremely well and four 
people were arrested for public order offenses chief inspector roy 
symons said about 50 supporters of the extreme rightwing national 
front followed the march but there were no clashes

chicago millionaire noah robinson was 
sentenced to the maximum 10 years in prison saturday after being 
found guilty of a felony in connection with the attempted murder of 
a woman who witnessed a slaying 
robinson halfbrother of the rev jesse jackson and a greenville 
native was charged with murder and conspiracy in the death of leroy 
hambone barber state circuit judge james moore declared a 
mistrial on those counts when the jury failed to reach a verdict 
the jury convicted robinson of accessory after the fact of 
assault and battery with intent to kill in connection with the 
attempted murder of janice denise rosemond 
robinson 45 was accused of hiring someone to kill ms rosemond 
who witnessed the 1986 murder of barber ms rosemond survived a 
stabbing attack 
moore sentenced robinson to 10 years in prison and robinson was 
led away in handcuffs to the greenville county detention center 
ive said all along im innocent of the charges but im 
prepared to take the punishment the court will mete on me 
robinson said during sentencing 
moore declared a mistrial for the four other charges murder and 
conspiracy to commit murder in the barber slaying and criminal 
conspiracy and accessory before the fact of assault and battery with 
intent to kill in connection with the rosemond attack 
solicitor joe watson the prosecutor said robinson will face 
another trial on those charges 
defense attorneys said they would appeal the conviction and an 
appeal bond of 100000 was set moore also reinstated bond of 1 
million on the other charges robinson remained in custody late 
saturday officials said 
robinson was accused of hiring members of the el rukn gang of 
chicago to come to greenville to kill barber a former employee and 
childhood friend 
before beginning deliberations saturday the jury asked the judge 
what would happen if they reached a verdict on only some of the 
charges moore told the jurors a mistrial would be called only on 
those indictments they couldnt decide 
the jury spent 16 hours deliberating the trial began jan 16 
earlier defense attorney robert simone asked that one of the 
jurors be removed because watson had coached the womans children on 
a swim team moore denied the request 
simone said he was really upset about the sentence but said 
there was logic behind that verdict 
i think the jury probably inferred that robinson knew about 
the attack on ms rosemond simone said but they did not reach a 
conclusion that he was involved before or during the incident he 
said 
during the trial watson traced the history of chicagos el rukn 
gang and its ties to robinson 
witnesses testified that robinson was a close friend of jeff 
fort the leader of the gang who is serving time in a texas prison 
on drug charges witnesses also testified that robinson wielded a 
significant amount of power in the organization 
watson told the jury of robinsons stormy relationship with 
barber with whom robinson had physically fought and whom robinson 
believed broke into buildings he owned in chicago 
simone said robinson was a victim of a misguided investigation 
the attorney argued that prosecutors had made deals with known 
criminals who in testifying to save their own skin had 
implicated an innocent man

supplies in outlying alaskan villages 
dwindled saturday when delivery trucks were idled by flat tires 
caused by a brutal cold snap that prompted the governor to declare a 
state of emergency 
the official low for the 12 hours ending at 4 pm saturday was 
69 degrees below zero at farewell lakes near mcgrath the weather 
service said it also received an unofficial reading of 86 degrees

theres no give to the tires at this temperature platten 
said they get a flat spot from sitting and they pop the bead from 
around the rim or crack at the base of the valve stem when you go to 
drive 
the operator of a store at tanana predicted supplies would last 
only a few days longer 
then well be running out of things bread eggs and milk

indoors

below at several locations including the north slope on alaskas 
northern coast officials said 
the national weather service said the extreme cold could continue 
for another week or two in interior alaska meteorologists

a railroad tanker filled with sulfur 
dioxide leaked saturday spewing hazardous fumes with the stench of 
rotten eggs and forcing evacuation of hundreds of people from the 
downtown area for several hours 
authorities said the union pacific tanker car was on a siding 
near the boundary county fairgrounds adjacent to downtown when it 
sprang a two to threeinch hole shortly after 630 am 
an estimated 400 to 500 people some elderly were forced out of 
businesses and homes and sheriffs officers maintained roadblocks 
to keep people out 
residents were allowed to return about 330 pm but were warned 
they should leave again if they smelled any fumes said allen 
chrisman a us forest service official 
things are looking good chrisman said all the folks have 
been returned to their homes 
among the evacuees was boundary county clerk norma estep who 
said there was no panic and praised civil defense personnel who 
responded to the evacuation order 
our emergency crews did an excellent job mrs estep said 
im really proud of them 
the tanker continued to leak saturday afternoon but robert 
heffner of the state communications and poison control center in 
boise said it had been moved about five miles south of town and a 
nearby farm house was evacuated as a precaution 
crews were venting the gas through barrels of lime to neutralize 
the sulfur dioxide chrisman said the crews planned to monitor the 
situation through the night and eventually transfer the material to 
another tank car 
it was pretty thick this morning but its a lot clearer now 
jeannie alonzo a sheriffs dispatcher said late saturday morning 
it just hurt to breath it 
nine people people were treated for minor eye irritation and 
respiratory problems at boundary county community hospital then 
released a nursing supervisor said one person with a history of 
respiratory ailments was admitted for observation 
another person who was downtown at the time of the leak later 
died of a heart attack at the hospital but officials were uncertain 
if the death was related to the leak 
downtown residents were taken to the local high school and to a 
methodist church at the south end of town on a hill sheriffs 
spokeswoman jane kirby said all the evacuees later were moved to 
the church in the town of about 2000 in the idaho panhandle 26 
miles south of the canadian border 
the rupture apparently resulted from a structural failure caused 
by corrosion said scott lund a compliance supervisor for the state 
division of environmental qualitys hazardous materials bureau 
a hazardous materials team from the spokane wash fire 
department was on the scene assessing the danger and beginning a 
cleanup a hazardous materials response team from british columbia 
also was sent along with officials from the state division of 
environmental quality the federal environmental protection agency 
and union pacific 
sulfur dioxide is a heavy colorless suffocating gas used as a 
bleach disinfectant refrigerant or preservative it also is used 
in paper pulping and food processing 
it is liquefied under pressure for shipping heffner said the 
leak sent a bluish plume of vapor into the air but the weight of 
the gas kept it close to the ground 
prolonged exposure to the gas which has a rottenegg smell can 
cause nausea vomiting or even death when mixed with water sulfur 
dioxide forms a corrosive acid but heffner said there did not appear 
to be any immediate environmental danger 
the tanker originated in trail british columbia and was bound 
for trentwood wash near spokane said john bromley a union 
pacific spokesman in omaha neb lund said the sulfur dioxide was 
the property of cominco american

many state and municipal governments say they are confident they 
will escape the effects of last weeks supreme court ruling striking 
down a racial quota system for publicworks contracts because their 
plans are less strict 
boston and atlanta are among the exceptions and officials there 
say some programs may be jeopardized 
the justices by a 63 vote struck down a program in richmond 
va that required whiteowned companies bidding on any city 
contract to set aside 30 percent of the contracts value for 
minorityowned subcontractors 
the ruling said rigid racial quotas must be supported by evidence 
of past discrimination for example that blackowned enterprises 
tried to obtain construction contracts but were denied them without 
such evidence the use of racial quotas violates the 
equalprotection rights of whites the court said

us defense experts lashed out at 
west germany on saturday accusing the bonn leadership of benign 
neglect of chemical weapons controls and a cavalier attitude 
toward its nato responsibilities 
the charges came during an annual conference for nato military 
strategists 
the meeting opened with a cautious speech by defense minister 
rupert scholz in which he gave only a hesitant endorsement to nato 
plans to extend the range of some europeanbased nuclear missiles 
scholz was attempting to straddle the fence between the us 
position that shortrange missile modernization is necessary to 
protect longstanding nato defense strategies and the broadly held 
view among west germans that missile replacement is unnecessary 
because of improving eastwest relations

to the surprise of almost everybody and the 
consternation of more than a few wall street is starting to look as 
though the great bull market of the mid1980s is back 
over the past few trading days stock prices have staged a 
runaway rise on heavy volume that evokes vivid images of january two 
years ago 
in the heady atmosphere that prevailed then the dow jones 
industrial average broke 2000 for the first time and finished the 
month with a net gain of 262 points 
if the market is going to match that performance this month it 
will have to get even hotter than it has been in the two january 
sessions that remain some analysts think it is overdue for a 
breather 
still it has been an impressive performance especially when you 
consider the uncertainty and skepticism that predominated in the 
financial world as the new year began 
to many investors of course the news is exhilarating helping 
to wipe out both the dollarsandcents losses and the unpleasant 
memories created by the crash in the fall of 1987 
to others who had been cautiously waiting for better 
investment opportunities however it has been a nasty surprise 
consider the position in which many money managers at investing 
institutions such as pension funds find themselves 
in the chastened atmosphere that followed the crash they 
carefully marshaled cash reserves as a cushion against further 
trouble ahead thus a lot of people were underrepresented in stocks 
when prices took off again 
when your clients have suffered a drubbing in the market 
collapse how are they going to take it when you tell them they 
missed out on the recovery 
that kind of thinking analysts say has prompted a rush to get 
into the market and helped keep the rally going 
there have been other favorable forces as well including recent 
talk in washington of restoring a tax break for capital gains and 
giving dividends better tax treatment as well 
but the stocks that would benefit most directly from tax changes 
the smaller issues many individual investors like to buy havent 
been the standout gainers in recent weeks 
instead the top performers have been the blue chips and bigname 
technology issues that are the common currency in which the 
institutions deal 
in the past week the dow jones average of 30 bluechip 
industrials jumped 8750 points to 232286 for its best weekly 
showing so far in the rally dating back to late november 
the new york stock exchange composite index climbed 362 to 
16478 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
rose 634 to 39796 and the american stock exchange market value 
index rose 205 to 32157 
volume on the big board averaged 19640 million shares a day up 
from 16140 million the week before 
robert stovall president of stovalltwentyfirst advisors inc 
said catchup buying by investing institutions has been a 
predominant force in the market of late 
the train is leaving the station and they have to get on 
stovall said its just a case of raw supply and demand 
the current resemblance to the early days of 1987 is a bit 
spooky he acknowledged given the vulnerable position the market 
reached that year and the debacle that followed 
i think that anybody who jumps in now is coming late to the 
feast stovall said in this environment its dangerous because 
the fundamentals havent changed very much
