chancellor helmut kohls centerright 
coalition on sunday easily won the first free allgerman elections 
since 1932 buoyed by his popularity as the man who crafted swift 
unification 
in perhaps the biggest surprise the greens environmental party 
of former west germany europes bestknown ecology movement lost 
all their seats only the greens sister party in eastern germany 
won seats in the new parliament 
the balloting capped a breathtaking transformation that began 
with a revolt last year against east germanys communist government 
and led to the merging of east and west germany on oct 3 
east germanys former ruling communist party now called the 
party for democratic socialism won 17 seats in the new german 
parliament but lost much of the support it had earlier this year 
according to final returns 
a jubilant kohl was greeted at his christian democrat party 
headquarters by a throng of wellwishers 
this is a day of great joy he told them this is a great 
success and something to be proud of 
at the headquarters of the rival social democrats the scene was 
somber we have lost the election kohls rival oskar 
lafontaine told his supporters 
according to final results kohls coalition the christian 
democrats its bavarian sister party and the free democrats took 
548 percent of the vote compared to 335 percent for the social 
democrats 
berlin divided until just over a year ago by the berlin wall 
held its own united elections social democrat mayor walter momper 
lost to his predecessor conservative eberhard diepgen of kohls 
party 
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party the 
christian social union increased their parliamentary seats from 
305 to 313 the social democrats who had 226 seats before the 
vote captured 239 
along with kohl foreign minister hansdietrich genscher was 
among the big victors genschers free democrats kohls junior 
coalition partner will increase their representation from 57 to 79 
seats in the 656seat parliament they gained 11 percent of the 
vote 
the free democrats and kohls party have already said they would 
form a new coalition if kohl won 
the poor showing of the greens was one of the biggest election 
surprises final returns said the greens across germany lost all 
but eight of their 48 parliamentary seats in the former west 
germany they garnered only about 48 percent of the national vote 
less than the 5 percent needed for parliamentary representation 
that means the greens main leaders will be excluded from 
parliament 
the greens sister branch in former east germany won about 7 
percent of the vote under onetime special election laws small 
parties in former east germany can enter parliament by chalking up 
at least 5 percent on their home turf 
in west germanys 1987 federal elections the greens won 83 
percent 
the greens who initially resisted swift german unification 
were one of europes first ecology groups whose disarmament 
policies brought them support and seats in the federal parliament 
in the 1980s 
but the greens became rebels without a cause when mainstream 
parties embraced ecology as their own theme and disarmament accords 
began removing nuclear missiles from germany 
the election results include all the votes but the official 
count will be approved later this week 
lafontaine blamed his social democrats loss on kohls ability 
to capitalize on the tumultuous events that began with east 
germanys peaceful revolution in october 1989 and led to 
unification 
there were official events which gave the stage to the 
government and gave the opposition difficulties in articulating its 
program he said 
germany last voted freely as one nation in november 1932 two 
months later hitler was named chancellor and soon drove through 
laws depriving nonnazis of their seats in parliament hitlers 
designs triggered world war ii which laid waste to europe and 
carved two ideologically opposed german nations out of one 
kohl automatically became the leader of all germany when the two 
states merged on oct 3 
even as germans looked to a united future the election was 
shadowed by a reminder of a dark past officials were seeking entry 
to a soviet military hospital near berlin to arrest former east 
german leader erich honecker 
honecker 78 is accused of personally issuing shoottokill 
orders to prevent people from fleeing the communist state he ruled 
with an iron hand for 18 years before being swept from power in 
october 1989 a warrant for his arrest was issued on friday 
the ard network said the social democrats were badly defeated in 
former east germany where they won 25 percent of the vote to 57 
percent for kohls coalition 
east germanys former communists won less than 1 percent of the 
vote in western germany and 95 percent in former east germany 
in berlin last months street battles between police and 
squatters had caused the collapse of the leftist municipal 
government strengthening the conservatives hand 
the christian democrats led by diepgen had played on voters 
fears of growing lawlessness to triumph on sunday they were 
projected to win 401 percent of the vote diepgen said it was 
possible his party would form a grand coalition with the social 
democrats led by momper who was projected to win 303 percent of 
the votes according to the zdf network

the greens of former west germany who 
gained prominence in the 1980s with ecological and antinuclear 
causes were kicked out of the allgerman parliament in sundays 
election 
their sister party in former east germany running together with 
alliance 90 gained eight seats in the new 656member parliament 
according to final results hubert kleinert greens leader in the 
outgoing parliament described the outcome as a debacle 
its a heavy defeat and we all must ask ourselves why this is 
hapenning he said 
the greens who initially resisted swift german unification 
were one of europes first ecology groups whose disarmament 
policies brought them support and seats in the federal parliament 
in the 1980s they won 48 seats in the 1987 election 
but the greens became rebels without a cause when mainstream 
parties embraced ecology as their own theme and disarmament accords 
began removing nuclear missiles from germany 
our themes interest barely anyone said greens leader 
christian stroebele in a first reaction to the ballot results 
the greens in western germany received less than 5 percent of 
the vote the minimum needed to get into the federal legislature 
the greensalliance 90 list in eastern germany took 7 percent 
the alliance includes many prominent members of the prodemocracy 
movement that helped topple the former east german communist 
government last year 
preelection polls a few days before the ballot were still 
predicting that the greens would win about 9 percent of the vote 
they got 83 percent in 1987 
describing the partys campaign as amateurish kleinert 
said the party must fundamentally change if we are still to 
remain a party in the future 
stroebele said the greens will have a chance again once the 
euphoria of german unification dies down 
there is still a place for the greens we must see what 
mistakes we made what we must change he said 
rooted in the student movement of 1968 the antinato greens 
mobilized hundreds of thousands of west germans in massive 
antinuclear protests in the 1980s they first got into the federal 
parliament in 1983 shocking the political establishment 
but the greens leaders later became entangled in bickering about 
the partys course with one wing favoring a more traditional 
approach to politics while the other wanted the group to stay true 
to its roots 
several prominent greens defected to other parties while all 
mainstream parties embraced the environment as a major theme 
under ussoviet agreements nuclear missiles began being 
pulled out of germany leaving the greens without one of their most 
popular campaign themes 
the greens also resisted quick german unification and were the 
only party that voted against the state treaty this summer that 
paved the way for unification

east germanys former communists managed to win 
seats in the united german parliament on sunday but they lost much 
of their remaining support in a nation they once ruled 
the party of democratic socialism the renamed version of the 
party that controlled east germany for four decades won 17 seats 
in parliament according to final results 
it attracted less than 1 percent of the vote in western germany 
and more than 9 percent in eastern germany according to the 
traditionally reliable poll projections 
that was a sharp drop from the 164 percent the party earned in 
march when east germany held its first free elections and chose 
the democratic government that led the nation to unity with west 
germany on oct 3 
party leader gregor gysi put an optimistic spin on the results 
noting that the communists were strong enough to get into 
parliament he said they laid a foundation on which to build 
support in the west 
its not so much the quantity but the quality of support 
he said one now chooses us as the leftist democratic 
alternative 
the party also captured 93 percent of the vote in the berlin 
elections making it the thirdbiggest party in the citys 
legislature according to projections from germanys ard television 
network 
the party was represented in the allgerman parliament formed 
out of the legislatures of the two germanys immediately after 
unity it was apportioned 24 seats based on its level of support in 
the east 
ironically gysis party did better in eastern germany than the 
party containing many of the prodemocracy activists that toppled 
the communists in last autumns peaceful revolt the buendnis 
90greens coalition captured about 7 percent of the vote to gain 
eight seats 
a recent political scandal might have had an effect on the 
former communists drop in support since last march 
the communists are widely believed to still control millions 
perhaps billions of dollars in property and cash accumulated during 
their 40 years in power 
a former party official faces charges he tried to hide more than 
680000 in party assets 
berlins top law enforcement officer interior senator erich 
paetzold said last week that the party still illegally holds more 
than 68 million in bank accounts 
gysi has denied the party is hiding its assets and said he is 
not aware of attempts by officials to move money out of the 
country

occupied kuwait told sunday of long lines for food and of iraqis 
scavenging for scraps thrown away at the airport by departing 
foreigners 
some of the 437 filipinos who arrived here on a flight from 
basra iraq also said iraqi soldiers were still looting groceries 
and homes in occupied kuwait 
they said food prices in baghdad had jumped tenfold because of 
the united nations sanctions imposed following iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
theres so much hunger there lorenza panaranda 30 said of 
conditions in basra iraqs second largest city when we threw 
away our leftovers about 10 iraqis scrambled over our leftovers in 
the trashcan at the airport we left whatever food we had with 
them 
gregorio neri an arabicspeaking mechanic who acted as 
interpreter for the group in iraq said consumers in basra stand in 
line for up to four hours to buy a single loaf of bread 
the life of the iraqis now is hard he said filipino 
lives may be difficult but theirs is miserable i would never 
change places 
willie leola said that when his group which included five 
infants cleared customs at basra airport customs guards asked for 
their leftover baby formula 
the filipinos arrived aboard an iraqi airways jet on a flight 
paid for by the international organization of migration 
an estimated 90000 filipinos were working in kuwait and iraq 
before the iraqi invasion 
miss panaranda who had worked as a sales clerk in kuwait said 
she went to baghdad last month and then to basra for the flight 
she said shoopers waited for hours to buy limited supplies of food 
in baghdad 
there were queues for food all over she said instead of 
rice they eat gruel made of corn she said that in one 
neighborhood shoppers were limited to five kilos of rice per 
month 
conchita balisi 27 a former governess in kuwait said most 
groceries are closed in the occupied city 
some kuwaitis go to saudi arabia to buy food and then sell it 
back in kuwait she said 
lisa santuyo a maid in kuwait said iraqi soldiers were looting 
homes and shops of food appliances and other goods to ship back to 
iraq

a sleek rocket thundered 
into the sky over the central asian desert sunday in a joint 
sovietjapanese mission that carried the first journalist into 
space 
smoke and tongues of flame engulfed the launch pad as the 
150foot rocket lifted off at 113 pm 313 am est hurling 
the soyuz tm11 capsule and its crew toward a rendezvous with the 
soviet space station mir 
toyohiro akiyama the first journalist and first japanese in 
space joined the mission led by soviet cmdr viktor afanasyev and 
flight engineer musa manarov 
japans tbs television company paid the soviets 12 million to 
send akiyama a news director for the network into space they 
took out 22 million in insurance on his life 
all conditions normal said an announcer who gave reports 
every 10 seconds as the rocket soared into orbit in a flawless 
launch 
akiyama was to describe the trip in live radio and television 
broadcasts to tokyo and conduct sleep studies and experiments to 
see how japanese tree frogs cope in a gravityfree environment 
hundreds of foreign journalists watched the launch at the 
oncesecret baikonur cosmodrome 1250 miles east of moscow 
the space venture by tbs japans biggest private television 
company is a watershed for the two countries which never formally 
ended their world war ii hostilities and still dispute ownership of 
some islands off the japanese coast 
if we continue our friendship it would be good cosmonaut 
afanasyev said at a news conference saturday 
afanasyev and manarov will replace two soviet cosmonauts who 
have been in the space station for the past four months afanasyev 
and manarov are expected to stay in space for six months 
the eightday mission was the eighth to hook up with the mir 
space station since it was put into orbit in 1986 
fourteen foreign astronauts have ridden into space aboard soyuz 
capsules but akiyama is the first paying nonscientific passenger 
the flight also will boost the soviet unions twoyear effort to 
commercialize its space program 
the soviets need money akiyama said their space industry 
has to be competitive like the french chinese and americans have 
started to do its quite natural for the russians to start this 
kind of business 
if i work hard and im successful then i expect to get a 
bonus joked akiyama tbs former bureau chief in washington 
if i get space sickness then it should be counted as sick 
leave 
the journalist was carrying three amulets into space given to 
him by his father the prime minister of japan and by the president 
of tbs 
asked before launch what he was looking forward to most upon his 
return in eight days akiyama replied i cant wait to have a 
smoke 
more than 120 tbs reporters cameramen and technicians were 
brought to the cosmodrome to document the flight 
soviet officials went out of their way to open to display the 
cosmodromes huge installations for assembling rockets foreigners 
have been subject to a notsosubtle sales pitch 
we can launch any satellite from any country just bring it 
here said major gen alexei shumilin deputy director of testing 
at the cosmodrome

columbia shot spectacularly through 
a moonlit sky early sunday carrying seven astronauts and an 
astronomical laboratory into space and helping the nations space 
shuttle program end a frustrating year on an upswing 
its like an early christmas present said launch director 
bob sieck it sure goes a long way to erase the disappointments 
that we had this summer 
a soviet soyuz rocket carrying two cosmonauts and a japanese 
television journalist was launched 84 minutes later bringing to 12 
the number of people in space the most ever at one time two 
cosmonauts are on the space station mir the columbia crew hopes to

columbia had been grounded since may by hydrogen leaks and the 
shuttle atlantis was also delayed by leaks the launch at 149 am 
est came on the fifth attempt to put columbia and its astronomy lab 
in space for a 10day mission 
it was spectacular to watch it go up said arthur davidson 
of johns hopkins university principal investigator of one of the 
astro observatorys ultraviolet telescopes were getting a whole 
new look at the universe 
the 100ton spaceship flooded the sky with light visible for 
hundreds of miles as it thundered toward a 218milehigh orbit the 
launch was delayed 21 minutes when the air force which has 
responsibility for range safety sent a helicopter into a layer of 
clouds to confirm that visibility was sufficient 
the unusual helicopter check surprised nasa officials but air 
force col john wormington said afterward that it saved the launch 
from being postponed 
the moon shining through the clouds over the florida coast was 
brightened by the shuttles 700foot pillar of flames 
we really had a light show coming up that was really 
something said columbias commander vance brand at age 59 the 
oldest person to reach space 
it was nasas sixth shuttle flight this year three fewer than 
planned because of the hydrogen leaks that grounded columbia and 
atlantis through summer and early fall atlantis returned from a 
secret military flight less than two weeks ago 
astronomers have been waiting anxiously to send up the 150 
million observatory since the missions original launch date in 
1986 the mission was delayed until this year by the challenger 
accident 
as columbia orbits high above earths distorting atmosphere 
four astronomers on board will operate astros three ultraviolet 
telescopes roundtheclock an xray telescope will be managed by 
computer commands sent from the ground 
the observatory will remain anchored in columbias cargo bay 
throughout the flight and return to earth with the shuttle 
scientists expect to be surprised by many of astros findings 
since ultraviolet light and xrays are invisible from earth 
about 240 objects will be studied including jupiter quasars 
binary stars a supernova and comet levy which is on its way out 
of the solar system

iraq on sunday warned the soviet union that 
it could lose its influence in the arabs world if it sent troops to 
the persian gulf the official iraqi news agency reported 
soviet foreign minister eduward shevardnadze said thursday that 
moscow would send troops if soviets trapped in iraq were 
mistreated the soviets previously had said they wouldnt 
participate in the usled multinational force arrayed against 
saddam hussein

everyone should know that we will not hesitate to use force to 
protect the estimated 3000 soviet citizens still in iraq

further than it has go so far 
the soviets have two warships and a support vessel in the gulf

naval force blockading iraq

arms supplier during the 198088 war with iran the soviets have 
played a key mediation role in the gulf crisis but failed to 
convince saddam to withdraw from kuwait

technicians and oil specialists who have not been able to leave 
iraq

several thousand americans and europeans remain in kuwait and

baghdad on sunday with 15 american hostages whose freedom he 
secured in talks with president saddam hussein airport officials

the iraqi airways plane carrying the 33 hostages landed in amman 
at 134 pm 534 est after a 90minute flight from the iraqi

facilities in iraq and kuwait as human shields against attacks 
by the usled multinational force in the persian gulf 
us embassy officials welcomed ali and the american hostages 
us officials had earlier said alis trip to iraq was private 
the group had originally been scheduled to leave saturday but 
ali decided to stay on hoping to use the good will generated by 
president bushs offer to hold talks with iraq to win the release 
of more americans 
bush offered friday to send secretary of state james baker iii 
to baghdad for talks on resolving the gulf crisis triggered by 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait iraq on saturday agreed to the 
idea of peace talks 
but the iraqis apparently refused to free any more of the 
estimated 330 us citizens still held in iraq at least 100 of 
them as human shields another 600 remain in hiding in kuwait 
ali the former world heavyweight boxing champion spent more 
than a week in baghdad with two aides and two members of the

united germany on sunday held its first 
free elections in 58 years since adolf hitler seized power and led 
the country into world war ii and partition 
the polls opened under dreary skies with snow and light rain 
about 60 million people were eligible to choose the government for 
the newly united nation but initial reports said turnout was low 
germanys leaders were among the first to vote 
chancellor helmut kohl cast his ballot at noon in his hometown 
of oggersheim 65 miles south of frankfurt after attending church 
kohl and his christian democrats are widely favored to win because 
of his strong leadership in uniting the two germanys 
his main challenger leftist social democrat oskar lafontaine 
voted in saarbruecken in southwestern germany the capital of 
saarland state where he serves as governor 
kohl said germans had paid a high price for democracy and urged 
them to vote 
many people fought peacefully for the right to vote freely for 
decades they often suffered prison or worse this right is one of 
democracys most precious treasures kohl said in an interview 
published sunday 
the first projected results were expected at 630 pm 1230 
pm est 30 minutes after the polls close 
the momentous occasion was overshadowed saturday by disclosure 
that an arrest warrant had been issued for former east german 
communist chief erich honecker on charges he gave shoottokill 
orders at the berlin wall 
honecker 78 is accused of personally giving shoottokill 
orders at the berlin wall a city justice official said he said 
the warrant links honecker directly to the deaths of several people 
trying to escape east germany 
honecker ruled east germany for 18 years until a peaceful 
revolution in october 1989 swept him from power the events led to 
the unification of germany on oct 3 
sundays vote puts the final democratic seal on the yearlong 
drama of german unity that abolished the oneparty state of east 
germany and merged it with democratic west germany 
twelve million former east germans were joining 48 million 
former west germans at the polls together they were electing a 
new 656member parliament and the first chancellor of reunited 
germany 
germany last voted freely as one nation in november 1932 two 
months later adolf hitler was named chancellor and soon rammed 
through laws depriving nonnazis of their seats in parliament 
the disastrous defeat in world war ii left germany divided 
kohl who as chancellor guided west germany to unity with its 
eastern neighbor automatically became the leader of all germany 
when the two states merged 
a poll by the respected allensbach institute published saturday 
predicted kohls christian democrats and their bavarian sister 
party the christian socialists would earn 425 percent of the 
vote 
kohls junior coalition partner the free democrats bolstered 
by the growing popularity of their leader foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher were likely to receive 10 percent the poll 
said 
the opposition social democrats still trying to recover from 
their early resistance to quick unification were expected to 
receive no better than 345 percent of the vote the allensbach 
poll indicated no margin of error was given 
confident that voters will confirm the course he steered to 
unity kohl made only onefourth as many campaign appearances as 
lafontaine his social democratic challenger 
voters apparently will not erase communism from germanys 
political scene the party for democratic socialism the 
reformminded successor to east germanys former communist party 
is expected to win seats in the new parliament acccording to the 
allensbach poll 
party leader gregor gysi told his supporters that every vote for 
his group was a vote to uphold socialist ideals his comments 
appeared in a frontpage editorial in neues deutschland the party 
newspaper

secretary of state james a baker iii promised 
saddam hussein on sunday that the united states will not attack 
iraq if iraqi troops are withdrawn from kuwait and western hostages 
are freed 
there has never been any suggestion that force would be used 
if the un resolutions are fully complied with baker said on 
nbctvs meet the press program 
if he complied with the resolutions his reward for that would 
not be a military attack by the united states baker said 
those resolutions call for the unconditional withdrawal of iraqi 
troops from kuwait the release of all hostages and the restoration 
of the kuwaiti government 
a usled multilateral force has arrayed more than 350000 
troops against saddam in the persian gulf us forces now 
numbering more 240000 are expected to swell to around 400000 by 
next month and a un security council resolution passed last week 
authorized force against saddam if he does not pull out of kuwait 
by jan 15 
baker said there was an excellent chance saddam will quit 
kuwait because he knows he would face devastating military action 
if us troops moved against him 
us officials including president bush have voiced serious 
concern about saddams possession of chemical weapons and his 
program to develop nuclear weapons 
while the united states remains concerned about saddams 
weapons baker said we would have to find a way to address those 
issues in the aftermath of a resolution of the kuwaiti crisis 
bush has said he wants baker to travel to iraq sometime before 
jan 15 to have talks with saddam the president has also invited 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to the united states next week 
baker reiterated the us position that he would not negotiate 
on the un resolutions 
us officials saturday also said the talks would not be linked 
with the israeli occupation of arab lands as the iraqi government 
has demanded

accusations that intelligence officers murdered a 
homosexual pastor and recruited male prostitutes to entrap public 
figures are the latest problems for premier michel rocards 
troubled socialist government 
the scandals and allegations that justice minister henri nallet 
broke fundraising laws in running president francois mitterrands 
1988 reelection campaign add to other recent woes student 
protests ghetto riots and rocards narrow defeat by only five 
votes of a noconfidence vote introduced by the opposition 
one opinion poll indicated half the french people believe 
politicians are rather corrupt and onequarter think they are 
liars 
when the left was elected in 1981 they looked much cleaner 
than the right said pascal perrineau assistant director of the 
center for studies on french political life a private think tank 
now many voters are beginning to see the left isnt so 
pure he said they appear to have the same morality as the 
right in the end this only serves jeanmarie le pen 
le pen leader of the extremeright national front advocates 
expelling moslem immigrants and denounces the political 
establishment as corrupt 
the controversy about the intelligence agency renseignements 
generaux general information has fascinated france for months 
the agencys main task is gathering information about threats to 
state security but it also investigates prostitution narcotics 
and whitecollar crime 
on july 19 joseph douce 45 a former baptist clergyman who 
performed homosexual marriages vanished after two men claiming to 
be policemen visited his paris apartment 
three months later a man gathering mushrooms in a forest 
discovered a body halfdevoured by animals an autopsy proved it 
was douce 
the intelligence service had been investigating douce a 
militant homosexual expelled from the french baptist church in 1975 
in connection with a child prostitution ring 
two weeks before the abduction agents fired a shot at the home 
of a man they wanted to infiltrate douces entourage 
a police inquiry led to the questioning of three agents two 
have have been suspended and the third inspector jeanmarc 
dufourg 34 was fired nov 23 after talking about the case in 
several media interviews 
dufourg claimed his superiors ordered him to hire a young 
homosexual to compromise former justice minister pierre arpaillange 
and philippe guilhaume chief of the antenne 2 television channel 
dufourgs allegations led to numerous reports about the 
intelligence service 
it is said to have stolen mail from communist party offices 
planted agents in a conservative partys headquarters and burgled 
the offices of a prominent antiracism group 
interior minister pierre joxe has authorized a parliamentary 
inquiry into the intelligence agency afterward an independent 
body will be created to oversee police activities 
joxe also has faced pressure because of a bestseller by a 
whistleblowing police inspector antoine gaudino 
his book the impossible inquiry alleges that laundered 
money and illegal kickbacks from public works contractors financed 
the socialist election victory in 1988 
the title comes from gaudinos frustrated attempts in 1989 to 
investigate a marseille building scandal 
gaudino wrote that he and his partner discovered notes from 
meetings between socialist party leaders and members of a 
fraudulent political consulting firm 
he said they set up a scheme in which contractors would pay a 
percentage of project costs as campaign contributions to socialist 
candidates 
the book plunged nallet who had just been appointed justice 
minister into controversy 
nallet was mitterrands treasurer in the last nine weeks of the 
campaign too short a time he says to have learned of illicit 
financial activities 
joxe suspended gaudino for grave indiscretion

the united states was not the only western 
industrialized nation to see the gap between rich and poor widen 
during the last decade a government study notes despite critics 
charges that recent government policies contributed to the growth 
of earnings inequality 
according to a study which is forthcoming in the statistical 
publication review of income and wealth the same thing was 
happening in other countries with different policies 
this may suggest that the causes of greater inequality are 
related more generally to phenomena occurring across nations rather 
than to specific factors unique to one country say three census 
bureau economists who authored the study 
the increase in inequality in the united states is well 
documented said gordon green assistant chief of the housing and 
household economic statistics division of the bureau and one of the 
authors of the study 
there has been hardly anything available on other countries 
because the data hasnt been available but the increase in 
inequality occurred elsewhere even though their employment 
experiences were very different and there were policy differences 
and different institutional settings green said 
we havent really pinned down exactly whats going on he 
said and further study will be needed to look into the causes 
maybe it has something to do with the kind of jobs that are 
created and the skill requirements for those jobs 
in its annual report on income and poverty issued in september 
the census bureau said the wealthiest onefifth of families 
received 468 percent of household income during 1989 this was no 
higher than in 1988 but was up significantly from percentages of 
442 percent in 1979 and 43 percent in 1969 
there seems little doubt that the income distribution has 
become somewhat less equal over the past 20 years the bureau 
said in that report it said it did not know why 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the congressional joint 
economic committee said those at the top of the scale are 
receiving an everlarger share of the pie 
the new comparative study says evidence now exists that the 
phenomenon of growing earnings inequality may have an international 
or global dimension 
green was joined in the study by john coder a statistician 
economist and paul ryscavage a labor economist 
they said it did not necessarily reflect the views of the census 
bureau 
the study compares earnings of male heads of household aged 25 
to 54 working fulltime year around in the united states canada 
sweden australia and west germany the figures from the different 
countries were not all for the same year but were all in the 
mid1980s 
in the united states the top 10 percent of households had 228 
percent of the earnings higher than in any other country the top 
10 percent earned 189 percent in canada 18 percent in west 
germany 177 percent in sweden and 174 percent in australia 
the lowest 10 percent of americans earned 34 percent lower 
than any of the other countries except canada at 29 percent 
australia measured 38 percent and west germany 56 percent the 
poor were best off in sweden with 63 percent of the earnings 
the economists then used six different methods of measuring 
income inequality applying them to the same group of workers and 
found that the united states was the most unequal of the five 
countries by four of the methods canada was the most unequal by 
the other two sweden had the greatest equality by all methods of 
measurement 
again limiting their study to male heads of household aged 25 to 
54 the study found that the share of the top onefifth in the 
united states increased from 348 percent in 1979 to 374 percent 
in 1986 while the share of the lowest fifth dropped from 93 
percent to 85 percent in canada between 1981 and 1987 the 
wealthiest fifth increased from 314 to 334 and the poorest 
dropped from 105 to 85 in sweden in the same years the richest 
went from 308 percent to 302 percent and the poorest from 137 
percent to 135 percent 
in australia between 1981 and 1985 the wealthiest went from 
307 to 312 and the poorest from 113 to 105 in west germany 
the gain for the wealthiest between 1981 and 1984 was only 308 to 
316 per cent while the share of the poor dropped only from 128 
percent to 125 percent 
the average rate of employment growth during the periods 
measured was 15 percent in the united states 13 percent in 
canada and 11 percent in australia it was less than half of one 
percent in sweden in west germany employment was declining

becky malka 18 and avisha cohen 18 they were said to have 
slight to moderate injuries the attackers were not named 
becky malka said she and a friend had been on a shopping spree 
when the attack happened 
we got on the bus and behind us were three arabs suddenly 
they shouted allahu akbar and stabbed us they had kitchen 
knives she said 
bystanders and shopkeepers some of them armed tried to beat 
the attackers as they were taken off the bus one man was arrested 
for attacking the injured arab as he was carried away on a 
stretcher 
anyone who tries to attack an injured man whoever that man 
is will be arrested we are not animals said yaacov raz a 
commander of the greater tel aviv police force 
arabs on a tel avivbound bus would have attracted little 
attention since thousands ride in daily from the occupied 
territories to jobs in israel 
yigal marcus commander of tel aviv police said sundays attack 
meant tel aviv has returned to the map 
if anyone thought they the arabs had forgotten tel aviv and 
were only trying to stab in jerusalem reality has slapped them in 
the face marcus said 
in the oct 8 temple mount killings police opened fire on 
palestinian rioters the government put the death toll at 20 but 
the palestine human rights information center has put the toll at 
17

douglas dean stopped in front of the stadium site 
for the 1996 summer olympics and sighed at the sight of crumbling 
homes and crimeridden streets 
people always say whats wrong with the people of 
summerhill they dont have the olympic spirit the former state 
legislator said of his oncethriving black neighborhood why 
should we give up everything when nobody comes to help us 
dean is among many activists who believe the city so proud of 
its olympic conquest since it was chosen in september to play host 
for the games will cover up or bulldoze urban blight before the 
world comes to atlanta in 1996 
they fear builders will raze pockets of public housing and 
crumbling homes to make way for olympic facilities adding to the 
citys estimated 10000 homeless 
summerhill has seen the phenomenon before the city razed 
hundreds of homes there in 1964 for atlantafulton county stadium 
we ha a drugstore a fiveanddime anything you needed right 
here but the stadium kicked it all out said larry swann 52 
who grew up in the area and owns a ramshackle summerhill house 
theres no telling what theyre going to do 
atlanta olympic officials insist their plans call for no home 
destruction but admit the final authority the stillunformed 
atlanta committee for the olympic games could change plans 
were frustrated that we cannot respond with something more 
specific said olympic spokesman bob brennan but we got the 
games 11 weeks ago and theyre going to be six years from now 
we need a little breathing room 
john leak vice president of the businesssupported planning 
group central atlanta progress said a brochure produced by the 
atlanta organizing committee may be a warning the drawings show 
glistening architecture and pristine landscaping but nowhere are 
actual pictures of the innercity areas 
the two most affected areas are summerhill and techwood homes a 
housing project across from georgia tech where the olympic 
village home to 16500 athletes will be built the village later 
would provide student housing for georgia tech georgia state 
university and the atlanta university center according to a 
committee proposal 
if you just take the pretty drawings that now exist and try to 
place them on the sites depicted there are certain buildings that 
are affected he said 
for example the plan shows the olympic stadium built on the 
south parking lot of the existing stadium but drawn to scale it 
would infringe on an existing home for the elderly and a hospital 
looking at that plan you also dont see any provision for 
cars to be parked that naturally makes residents nervous leak 
added somethings got to give 
activists for the poor say the plans are typical of atlanta 
they have accused mayor maynard jackson of trying to push the 
homeless from downtown jackson also supported a recent proposal to 
ban begging although backers of the idea now propose to make 
begging a crime only when the panhandler accosts someone 
this is a city that believes in hiding its poor said sister 
carol schlicksup of people for urban justice the city isnt 
going to let the poor be seen by the world the olympics is going 
to devastate the poor communities 
they keep telling us they have no money to build us the 
emergency singlefamily housing maynard jackson promised us she 
said but when you talk about olympics all of a sudden theres 
lots of money 
central atlanta progress residents and activists have protested 
to brennan that the olympic committee never talked to residents 
before creating the olympic plan 
they also charge the committee gives more consideration to 
richer areas the aoc agreed to move the olympic tennis center out 
of blackburn park after dekalb county residents protested 
its a class thing now said columbus ward president of the 
summerhill neighborhood planning unit the upperclass whites who 
mainly own homes said they dont want it they listened when the 
poor blacks who have mostly rental property fuss they get no 
response at all 
well well stop the stadium if we have to stand in front of 
the bulldozers 
brennan said the tennis center could be moved because 25 other 
communities asked to play host to it 
we have no intention of moving ahead with any plan without 
involving people he said many of these people have lived 
there all their lives are feeling their homes threatened and i 
can appreciate that

thousands of miles apart but united in a similar predicament 
the california and new york state legislatures convene monday for 
special sessions called for midyear patches on leaky state budgets 
in albany democratic gov mario cuomo has proposed sharp cuts 
in state spending to deal with an estimated 1 billion deficit in 
new yorks 50 billion budget for the fiscal year that ends march 
31 
cuomo has called for state worker layoffs mandatory and unpaid 
employee furloughs and cuts in state aid for education and health 
care 
the situation is less serious in sacramento where republican 
gov george deukmejian who leaves office in january wants 1 
billion in cuts as a fiscal cushion in californias 75 billion 
budget without those cuts the budget for the fiscal year that 
ends june 30 could just break even or have a small deficit 
deukmejian has proposed 600 million in public school cuts a 
200 million reduction in the income tax credit for renters and a 
freeze on state hiring and purchases 
for new york this is the third straight year officials have 
faced state budget deficits and next year promises to be no 
better comptroller edward regan has said the state may be facing a 
potential deficit of as much as 3 billion then 
in the past cuomo and the legislature have been quick to turn 
to tax increases to help bail themselves out when they learned that 
spending had exceeded revenues last year new yorkers were hit 
with a 1 billion tax increase package and earlier this year they 
were socked with a record 18 billion in new taxes 
but last month cuomo won reelection to a third term with a 
lower percentage of the vote than expected despite being opposed by 
splintered and poorly funded opposition the potential 1992 
presidential candidate said the message from voters was clear 
they didnt want any new taxes 
that prompted cuomo to come forth with a deficit reduction plan 
that relies almost entirely on spending cuts under the governors 
plan before the legislature the states 9 billion school aid 
package would be sliced by 200 million and social service programs 
would be slashed by 125 million 
it provides for the firing of 2000 state workers and 4000 
other job eliminations through attrition and early retirement 
incentives by the end of the fiscal year 
while legislative leaders have been tinkering with cuomos 
proposals particularly in the politically sensitive areas of 
school aid and health care spending both assembly speaker mel 
miller and senate majority leader ralph marino have indicated they 
dont expect major changes 
quick approval of a cuomodeveloped plan would also leave the 
governor to shoulder most of the blame for politically unpopular 
cuts 
the california special session coincides with the regular 
opening of the regular 199192 session an opening that normally 
consists of swearingin ceremonies 
deukmejian who did not seek a third term this year would like 
lawmakers to approve his fiscal austerity plan before he leaves 
office to assure that his final budget remains in the black 
many legislators particularly majority democrats would rather 
wait until republican govelect pete wilson is sworn in jan 7 
deukmejian has been particularly uncompromising in budget debates 
while wilson has more of a conciliatory reputation 
the problem occurred this fall when tax revenues for the first 
four months of this fiscal year fell more than 400 million below 
estimates because of the faltering economy the budget passed last 
summer had a 13 billion reserve but that is expected to be 
depleted by the reduced revenues 
wilson has remained quiet about the budget a 1 billion fix now 
would help the task he faces just three days after his 
inauguration he must present the legislature with a proposed 
budget for the 199192 fiscal year on jan 10 
the state commission on state finance last week estimated there 
could be at least a 43 billion gap between estimated 199192 tax 
revenues and a currentlevel budget

a soviet rocket rode a 
column of fire into orbit in a pictureperfect launch sunday 
carrying two cosmonauts and a japanese television reporter who 
became the first journalist in space 
the liftoff which also launched a soviet effort to 
commercialize their space program was right on schedule under 
bright sunny skies on the remote central asian steppes of 
kazakhstan 
journalist toyohiro akiyama 48 joined soviet cosmonauts viktor 
afanasyev and musa manarov in the soyuz tm11 space capsule 
akiyama was a passenger under a 12 million contract between the 
soviet union and japans biggest private television company tbs 
underscoring the commercial nature of the mission the soviet 
rocket even had advertising slogans for tbs and other japanese 
companies emblazoned on its sides 
about an hour and a half before the soviet launch the us 
space shuttle columbia blasted off from cape canaveral fla the 
flight nasas sixth shuttle mission this year carried seven 
astronauts and an astronomical laboratory into space 
with two soviet cosmonauts already aboard the orbiting space 
station mir the two liftoffs brought to 12 the number of people in 
space the most ever at one time the columbia crew hopes to 
contact the soviet crew by radio 
the soviet rockets fiery blastoff shook shook a reviewing stand 
about a mile away in this oncesecret space installation 1200 
miles east of moscow 
i feel fine akiyama said minutes before the 113 pm 313 
am est liftoff during the eightday mission he will document 
the experience on radio and television for tbs 
the japanese television company is spending 37 million on the 
entire venture to mark its 40th year on the air according to 
network president izumi tanaka 
more than 120 tbs reporters cameramen and technicians scurried 
about the launch control center and reviewing stand to cover the 
launch even sacrificing a remotecontrol camera next to the rocket 
to watch the flames closeup before it burned 
akiyamas wife kyoko called the blastoff beautiful 
although she earlier said she was nervous 
but when i saw their faces on the television screen i calmed 
down and felt happier she said 
akiyama a tbs news director who quit a fourpackaday 
cigarette habit during the training was asked before liftoff what 
he looked forward to most on his return from the first trip into 
space by a japanese citizen 
i cant wait to have a smoke he said 
akiyama for whom tbs bought a 22 million life insurance 
policy carried stationery a picture of his family and three 
japanese goodluck charms into space 
tanaka the tbs president said the rocket took off just like 
a train on schedule he said akiyama would receive a promotion 
when he got back 
akiyama will return to earth with cosmonauts gennady manakov and 
gennady strekalov the current mir crew they will end a fourmonth 
stay in space and be replaced by manarov and afanasyev who will 
stay aboard the space station for six months 
in addition to live broadcasts akiyama will photograph 
environmental damage on earth and conduct experiments on japanese 
tree frogs to see how they cope in a gravityfree environment 
tbs also hopes to arrange a tlephone call dec 7 between 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and the cosmonauts 
soviet officials and tbs executives have held out the hope that 
the flight could improve ties between the two countries which 
never officially ended their world war ii hostilities 
the commercial contract boosts the kremlins drive to cash in on 
its soyuz space program in the face of critical economic problems 
at home 
despite receiving about 30 million from sponsors for several 
weeks of live coverage and documentaries about the space program 
tbs will not immediately turn a profit on the venture tanaka said 
yes we will lose about 74 million but we consider this 
loss the cost of tbs growth he said 
the mission will be the eighth to hook up with the mir space 
station since it was put into orbit in 1986 
although soviet scientists and 14 foreign cosmonauts have ridden 
into space aboard soyuz capsules akiyama is the first 
nonscientific paying passenger sundays launch culminates three 
years of planning between the japanese firm and soviet officials

president bushs visit to south america this 
week comes at a time when american concerns are turning from the 
cold war to economic cooperation in this hemisphere 
bushs first stop on his weeklong tour was to be brasilia 
brazil following an overnight flight from washington his 
itinerary also includes uruguay argentina chile and venezuela 
at each stop he is expected to hail the evolution to democratic 
rule in latin america and to promote his vision of a 
hemispherewide free trade zone 
after a decade in whcch us hemispheric policy was dominated by 
the political upheaval in central america bush now has the luxury 
of having what us officials like to call a positive agenda in 
his dealings with latin america 
skeptics wonder about the utility of his visit at a time of 
crisis in the persian gulf but bush feels it is important to seize 
on what he regards as a moment of unique opportunity in hemispheric 
relations 
bush was to have made the visit in september but postponed it 
because of the gulf situation secretary of state james a baker 
iii will remain in washington to deal with that issue 
each of the countries on bushs itinerary except venezuela began 
the last decade under military rule and now has an elected 
president venezuela has had stable democratic government since 
1958 
beyond that there is an emerging consensus in the hemisphere 
that radical economic reform is required to help the region escape 
from the lost decade of the 1980s a period in which 
production investment and consumption all fell sharply 
through his enterprise for the americas initiative unveiled 
last june bush is attempting to promote economic growth by 
encouraging more free trade and increased investment countries 
that adopt reform measures would be eligible for debt reduction 
the emergence of democratic governments coupled with the 
phasing out of the cold war and the willingness of most countries 
to undertake painful economic reform has produced an era of 
unusual harmony in us relations in latin america 
there was a similar period in the early 1960s when president 
john f kennedy launched the alliance for progress an ambitious 
social and economic reform program but kennedys death and a wave 
of military coups in latin america took the steam out of the 
alliance and hemispheric relations suffered 
for more the two decades the relationship was afflicted by 
divisive political disputes over such issues as human rights abuses 
and economic nationalism 
during the last decade there was resentment over us support 
for britain during the falkland islands crisis in 1982 and for the 
nicaraguan contras as the 1980s ended hemispheric condemnation 
for the us invasion of panama was widespread 
nowadays the mood between the united states and its neighbors 
to the south is far more relaxed there are fewer divisive issues 
and communist cuba has far less appeal as a model for other 
countries than it once did 
we are at the beginning of a new era says michael wilson 
an associate at the heritage foundation a conservative think tank 
some analysts believe the united states would derive immense 
benefits from an economically prosperous latin america a 
potentially lucrative market for us manufactured exports 
latin america rather than japan holds the key to the us 
trade deficit says peter drucker a professor of the claremont 
graduate school in california 
bush has pleased many latin countries by recognizing more than 
president ronald reagan did the need to combat the drug problem by 
adopting policies that reduce demand at home for many years the 
united states had caused resentment by placing more emphasis on 
efforts to reduce supply in producing countries 
no country has received more attention from the bush 
administration than mexico bush has met six times in two years 
with president carlos salinas including a twoday visit this past 
week in which both stressed their goal of reaching a free trade 
agreement 
both sides agree there is less tension in the relationship than 
at any time in recent memory

they left their homes on a gray misty 
morning to cast ballots for a brighter future even families could 
not agree on the candidates but they all voted for the same thing 
we want to have a better life said hildegard neumann 66 a 
resident of germanys most depressed eastern region life was not 
so good for the past 40 years 
delitzsch is one of scores of smoky smudged cities that stand 
amid sprawling processing plants in the south of what was once east 
germany 
this is saxony state the faintly beating heartland of the 
former nations fading industrial sector it is a stronghold of 
chancellor helmut kohls christian democrats who promise 
prosperity soon 
mrs neumann and her husband kurt voted in sundays united 
german elections for the party they believe will deliver on its 
promise 
we think that the christian democrats are the capitalists 
they are also christians and we need that the retired 
schoolteacher said she stood outside a poll station on a 
cobblestone street made drearier by the fog drifting between 
smogblackened buildings 
her husband marked his 69th birthday sunday unlike many older 
people he was not afraid of the end of communist subsidies that 
gave pensioners some security 
our rent starts to go up in january 15 percent energy and 
bus prices go up he said but im an optimist 
like neumann kathleen bobbe celebrated a birthday on sunday 
her 18th but she said she didnt think she would exercise her new 
right to vote 
i just dont know there are so many candidates said 
kathleen whose immediate goal is to go to a good school that will 
lead to a wellpaying job 
her fathers brother and his two sisters the children of a 
staunch communist gathered with their spouses at his home to 
celebrate kathleens birthday and talk politics most of them 
favored kohl 
kathleens father klaus bobbe lost a factory job but recently 
found work in a metalworking plant in the western german city of 
mannheim he stays in a rooming house and makes an 11hour round 
trip home on weekends 
a lot of people have given up on this area he said 
delitzsch is 12 miles north of leipzig where protests against 
the communist government began last year it is also where the 
rallies for german unity began 
theodor arnold who is married to bobbes oldest sister broke 
with most of the family and voted for the leftleaning social 
democrats 
hes angry that former communists still run the factories he 
also said the social democrats the main opposition party take 
human factors into account 
our prices are now higher than in the west but we still only 
make about a third as much he said 
arnold 40 was 10 years old when his father moved the family 
east from the former west german city of frankfurt the next year 
1961 the communists closed the borders and built the berlin wall 
my father tried to get us all out again he said it 
wasnt too bad he only had to serve five months in prison 
arnold speaks three languages and mimics american rock and roll 
on a guitar he taught himself to play he collects models of 
antique cars studies birds tells ribald political jokes plays 
soccer and holds a university mathematics degree 
he bought a book one thousand entirely legal ways to avoid 
paying taxes to help him understand new western tax laws 
despite education and intellect he toils in a struggling 
aluminum factory 
i was from the west i had family there my father was in 
prison and i always argued with my professors about the 
communists said the father of two girls it was difficult to 
find a job 
despite the social democratic party stickers plastered on his 
tiny east german car it is the more conservative christian 
democrats who deliver the message that captivates his neighbors 
the party dominated east germanys first free national elections 
in march its local elections in may and its state elections in 
october 
on sunday benidikta henger voted for them again in an election 
she said was even more important than the vote for the government 
that led the nation to unity 
in march we knew we were electing a government for only a 
short time said the 23yearold mother of two this one will 
be around for a long time

whiteled government fails to halt chronic violence in black 
townships 
mandela spoke at a funeral for david tshoga who was killed by 
police in an illegal protest march later the 300 people attending 
marched to the northern suburb of emmerentia where tshoga became 
the first black buried at westpark cemetery

in the previous 24 hours 
it said three hacked and stabbed bodies were found in the 
bekkersdal black township southwest of johannesburg while a deputy 
mayor of the khayelitsha township near cape town was stabbed to 
death 
in many townships residents oppose local leaders whom they 
consider collaborators with the government and its apartheid system 
of racial segregation 
five people died in a clash between unidentified groups armed 
with guns at table mountain in natal province and four houses were 
also burned the body of another man with bullet and stab wounds 
was found in the area the report said

freedom party and xhosas and other blacks linked to the anc 
more than 5000 people have died over five years in august the 
black factional fighting spread to black townships near 
johannesburg leaving at least 800 people dead 
both groups oppose apartheid but they differ on the policies of 
a future south african government inkatha favors a free market 
system and promotion of tribal heritage while the anc advocates 
leftist and pantribal policies 
the anc renewed charges this week that security forces have been 
aiding inkatha fighters in the violence around johannesburg 
it provided a videotape to local journalists that reportedly 
showed armed inkatha members getting out of a police vehicle and 
leading a march in zonkizezwe a squatter camp hit by unrest in 
recent weeks 
the government declared zonkizezwe an unrest area thursday

have aided inkatha and challenged the anc to provide proof of 
complicity 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said sunday the inkatha 
members were transported in a police vehicle to negotiate with 
xhosa leaders and police he said xhosa leaders also were 
transported in a police vehicle for the talks 
journalists at the scene told the sunday star newspaper that 
three inkatha members had negotiated with police then left the

officials on sunday sought soviet approval to 
enter a soviet military hospital near berlin and arrest former east 
german communist leader erich honecker on charges of manslaughter 
officials said saturday they had issued an arrest warrant for 
honecker who was ousted last year during the peaceful east german 
revolution that led to german unity oct 3 
the warrant charges that honecker personally signed 
shoottokill orders for guards at the berlin wall during his rule 
it directly links him to the deaths of several people who were 
killed trying to flee east germany officials say 
a soviet diplomat said sunday that german police need moscows 
approval to arrest honecker at the wellguarded hospital compound 
where he has taken refuge with his wife the hospital is outside 
beelitz a town in former east germany in a forest 20 miles south 
of berlin 
some german officials criticized the soviets for not turning 
honecker over immediately there were complaints that the soviets 
were trying to protect their former ally 
valery zhilin who identified himself as a first secretary at 
the soviet general consulate in former east berlin said he did not 
expect permission for honeckers arrest to be granted on sunday 
its a very complicated situation zhilin said in a 
telephone interview it will be decided at the very top 
he said that gen boris v snetkow the commanding officer of 
the soviet forces in eastern germany was away on a business trip 
honecker 78 conferred with his defense lawyers on sunday at 
the hospital complex his lawyers maintain he is too ill to stand 
trial 
the arrest warrant was issued friday and officials began moving 
against honecker on saturday the eve of the first free elections 
in united germany in 58 years 
walter momper the acting berlin mayor told the bonnbased die 
welt newspaper he believed honecker would stand trial in 1991 
some 200 people died trying to escape east germany during the 
28year existence of the berlin wall and the barbed wire barrier 
that separated the two german states 
the soviet union must get used to german sovereignty momper 
said in an interview it cannot protect a german citizen from 
criminal proceedings the soviet union and the other three world 
war ii allies that defeated nazi germany had special rights in the 
divided land until unification when germany regained its 
sovereignty 
honecker became a citizen of united germany when the democratic 
west absorbed the once communist state of east germany on oct 3 
the soviet army cannot act as honeckers protecting power 
said heiner geissler a board chairman of chancellor helmut kohls 
christian democratic union 
testimony by honecker could be potentially embarrassing to the 
soviet leadership 
in a bitter newspaper interview with the eastern berlin daily 
wochenpost two weeks ago honecker blamed soviet authors 
for his downfall on nov 18 1989 
in november honecker told the british weekly the european that 
he was being offered as a scapegoat and said unidentified 
intriguers brought him down 
the adn news agency quoting honeckers lawyers said sunday 
that he denied ever giving an interview to a journalist of the 
londonbased daily and that a conversation he had with the author 
of the article was of a purely private nature 
the news agency adn reported that honecker had not registered 
for sundays national elections and therefore were not eligible to 
vote

i think that makes the case clearly said rep claude 
harris dala who is campaigning for one of the southern regional 
seats on the steering and policy committee we need more 
representation from our region 
i really see a writing off of the south said rep ed 
jenkins dga who was defeated by rep richard gephardt dmo 
last year in the race for house majority leader 
theyll accept a socialist a lot easier than they will accept 
a conservative southern democrat said jenkins referring to 
vermont repelect bernie sanders bid to join the democratic 
caucus 
it is not i dont think a conscious thing but were simply 
not being well represented as a region jenkins said in an 
interview last week 
after jenkins lost his bid for majority leader foley promised 
he would consider southern conservatives when making appointments 
in an effort to provide some additional balance in the 
leadership 
an aide to foley said sunday that a very great attempt has 
been made to do fulfill that pledge he noted that rep beryl 
anthony dark served as chairman of the democratic congressional 
campaign committee 
but the leadership still is cognizant of the desire to have a 
socalled southern leadership person in the smaller circle 
said the aide who spoke only on condition he not be named he said 
the appointment of another southerner to a leadership position is 
also being considered 
the aide and another foley staffer predicted sanders who ran as 
an independent would not be elected to the democratic caucus 
harris in his bid for the steering and policy seat has been 
reminding his southern colleagues that they have little say in 
committee assignments in setting the agenda of the house or in 
scheduling legislation 
our problem in particular is that our folks havent been as 
vocal as those from other parts of the country harris said 
weve got to get in there and work to make sure our voice is 
heard 
southern democrats like harris 50 and jenkins 57 say efforts 
to land new leadership and committee slots for the region are 
particularly crucial now since much of the souths influence in 
congress comes from aging committee and subcommittee chairman 
in the appropriations committee for example the five 
southerners who chair subcommittees range in age from 60 to 81 on 
the taxwriting ways and means committee only six of the 23 
members are from the south and two of those both subcommittee 
chairmen are over 70 
if you look at the numbers and see all the people coming on 
major committees from outside our region theres no question 
theres going to be fewer and fewer southerners in influential 
positions harris said 
jenkins who has argued for years that the south is the key that 
can unlock the white house for democrats said the house 
leaderships failure to include southern conservatives in their 
inner councils can only further erode support for the party in the 
south 
the end result he said is that they can make these 
appointments or they wont have to anyway because it will be all 
republicans

iraq launched surfacetosurface missiles 
sunday in what appeared to be test firings us and british 
military officials said defense secretary dick cheney said they 
may have been scud missiles 
there were reports that allied forces in the persian gulf went 
on alert but us military officials refused to discuss that 
in washington cheney confirmed the firings and said they were 
apparently scud missiles or scud variants he said the test tok 
place entirely within iraqi territory 
he said iraqi president saddam hussein has used scud missiles in 
the past with conventional warheads but he said the missiles 
which have a range of up to 400 miles could conceivably carry 
chamical weapons 
theyre not very accurate accurate enough to hit a city not 
accurate enough to hit a point target cheney said in an 
interview on abctv 
the defense secretary said the last such test launch was in 
april four months before the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
its i think proof again if anybody needed any that he 
does in fact have ballistic missiles and the capacity to use 
them cheney said 
the us militarys general information bureau in saudi arabia 
released a terse statement about the incident 
we received indications this morning that iraqi armed forces 
conducted activity that included the firing of surfacetosurface 
missiles within iraq the statement said the flight path of 
the missiles was away from us and coalition forces 
the us and british officials did not say how many missiles 
were fired or what type they were nor would they say how the 
missiles were detected but they were apparently monitored either 
by us spy satellites or awacs airborne earlywarning radar 
planes which are on patrol around iraq and kuwait 24 hours a day 
none of the allied officials would say whether an alert was 
ordered among the 240000 us military personnel and the 
150000member allied force including 16000 britons massed in 
the region 
we are aware of missile activity within iraq earlier today and 
the necessary precuations were taken by british forces said a 
british defense ministry spokesman in london speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
troops in the region were reported to have been put on yellow 
alert last thursday when the un security council passed a 
resolution giving iraq until jan 15 to leave kuwait or face 
possible military action 
yellow alert status is one category below full combat alert

secretary of state james a baker iii has sent 
a message to his israeli counterpart assuring him that washingtons 
overtures toward iraq do not signify a change in us policy 
israel radio said sunday 
foreign minister david levy who read the message to the cabinet 
during its weekly meeting expressed satisfaction with the us 
clarifications 
there is no change in the united states position there is no 
change in its principles against aggression and there is no change 
in its opposition to any kind of linkage between iraqi aggression 
and the arabisrael conflict levy told israel radio 
but levy also warned that if saddam hussein is allowed to keep 
his weapons of mass destruction he will remain a threat to israel 
the middle east and europe as well as to the worlds economy the 
radio said 
baker apparently sent the message to reassure israel after 
president bush offered to send baker to iraq to discuss a peaceful 
resolution of the persian gulf crisis which began with baghdads 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
bush has also invited iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to 
washington 
iraq accepted the offer but demanded a serious and deep 
dialogue that would include the palestinian question 
saddam has repeatedly declared he would negotiate a withdrawal 
from kuwait if the israelis pull out of the west bank and gaza 
strip which were captured in the 1967 arabisraeli war the united 
states has rejected any such linkage 
science minister yuval neeman from the rightwing tehiya party 
drew criticism for remarks sunday that any usiraq talks would 
threaten israel 
he said an agreement between iraq and the united states would 
come at israels expense and equated a visit by baker to baghdad 
with former british prime minster neville chamberlains meeting 
with adolf hitler in munich prior to world war ii 
at that time chamberlain believed hitler was a rational 
statesman and in 1938 signed the munich pact which surrendered 
parts of czechoslovakia to the nazis without that countrys 
agreement 
i am very much afraid that from a strong posture that bush 
took until now he has now moved into one that could represent 
appeasement neeman said on israel television my impression is 
that if this will be the process then we are in the position of 
czechoslovakia and this is what we have to prevent 
levy said neemans statements were damaging and did not 
represent the opinion of the israeli government the cabinet 
certainly disagrees with them levy said 
bush made his offer last week after the un security council 
voted to authorize the use of military force against iraq if it has 
not withdrawn from the oilrich emirate by jan 15

president mikhail s gorbachev on sunday named 
former kgb general boris pugo as interior minister after relieving 
vadim bakatin of the job in a possible shakeup of the countrys law 
and order ministry 
gorbachev released vadim bakatin from the duties of the soviet 
interior minister in connection with his transition to another 
job the state news agency tass reported 
bakatins replacement must be approved by the supreme soviet 
legislature the report said 
the report did not say whether the 53yearold bakatin was being 
promoted or punished officials have said there has been a sharp 
rise in economic and violent crime stemming from the nations 
political crisis 
gorbachev has been threatening a crackdown for more than a 
month he has also said that he planned drastic changes in the 
government structure especially the council of ministers headed by 
prime minister nikolai ryzhkov the prime minister is widely blamed 
for the failure of the governments economic reforms 
pugo 53 was first secretary of the communist party in the 
baltic republic of latvia in 198488 but was forced out due to the 
growing independence movement there 
pugo becomes the most prominent baltic native in a communist 
party and government leadership that is dominated by russians he 
is not considered popular in latvia however because he was deputy 
chief and chief of the kgb in latvia from 197784 and has resisted 
the baltic drive for independence 
the three baltic republics of latvia lithuania and estonia have 
declared independence this year but gorbachev has refused to allow 
them to leave 
pugo chairman of the communist partys control committee since 
1988 and strong gorbachev supporter was appointed to take 
bakatins place by presidential decree tass reported 
he was named a nonvoting member of the communist party 
politburo in september 1989 but was dropped last july during 
reforms that drastically reduced the power of the party

iraq on sunday issued a strong message to 
the soviet union warning it not to send troops to the persian gulf 
to help the multinational force 
baghdad also told president bush not to use proposed talks with 
iraq on the gulf crisis as a pretext with the american people to 
justify his aggression against iraq 
the statements were among a number of declarations by the 
official iraqi news agency the foreign ministry statecontrolled 
newspapers and parliament they gave the impression of growing 
defiance by baghdad in the face of mounting international resolve 
by washington and its allies to end iraqs occupation of kuwait 
the message to moscow came from the foreign ministry the iraqi 
news agency said it said it was a response to soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadzes statement thursday that everyone 
should know that we will not hesitate to use force to protect the 
estimated 3000 soviet citizens still in iraq 
the same day the soviet union backed a un security council 
resolution authorizing military force to free kuwait if the iraqis 
do not get out by jan 15 
an unidentified iraqi foreign ministry spokesman said 
shevardnadze seems to be looking for a pretext to send troops to 
the region he warned the kremlin to go no further than it has 
gone so far 
the statement made no overt threat against the soviets in iraq 
and said they enjoy full care and security 
the soviets have two warships in the gulf region but they have 
not apparently taken part in the usled multinational naval force 
blockade of iraq the kremlin has said it would not become 
militarily involved unless its forces were under un command 
moscow has a friendship treaty with baghdad and was its main 
arms supplier during the 198088 war with iran 
the soviets have played a key mediation role in the crisis but 
have also become impatient with saddams refusal to withdraw from 
kuwait 
the comments by iraqi officials came as a soviet envoy met with 
senior iraqi officials sunday seeking the release of soviet 
citizens mainly oil specialists and technicians 
there were about 10000 soviets including several hundred 
military advisers in iraq and kuwait before the invasion most 
have been allowed to leave in groups 
iraq has blamed misunderstandings and bureaucracy for the 
delays in evacuating the remainder 
iraqs ruling revolutionary command council said saturday it 
accepted bushs offer to send secretary of state james a baker iii 
to baghdad for talks on the gulf crisis 
but it said the talks must include the issue of israels 
occupation of arab land 
the iraqis have repeatedly linked their occupation of kuwait 
with the palestine issue but the americans have rejected that 
linkage 
first deputy prime minister taha yasin ramadan said sunday that 
the bush administrations desire for talks indicates a retreat 
after grasping that world and arab public opinion uncovered its 
misleading behavior for achieving its own interests the official 
iraqi news agency reported 
the alqadissiyah newspaper stressed that iraq was not 
interested in a proforma meeting which bush needs to overcome 
his domestic problems and which he might use as a new pretext with 
the american people to justify his aggression against iraq 
bushs overture to iraq was widely seen as a move to placate 
congressional critics and others counseling against military action 
that could result in thousands of casualties and create political 
turbulence in the middle east 
bush doesnt appear to have any formula to offer iraq to induce 
it to quit kuwait and has repeatedly stressed that there is nothing 
to negotiate 
he said friday that no big results should be expected from 
any talks with iraq 
more than 350000 troops are in the persian gulf as part of the 
usled multinational force american troops now numbering more 
240000 are expected to swell to around 400000 by next month

the national weather service has fallen short 
of its mission to warn the public of savage weather that claims 
more than 400 lives and causes 6 billion in damage every year a 
newspaper reported sunday 
the federal agency misses twothirds of all tornadoes 
threefifths of all flash floods and 40 percent of severe 
thunderstorms every year the plain dealer reported 
severe storms strike without warning from the weather service 
more than 4000 times and without a preliminary watch 5000 
times each year 
government forecasters failed to issue warnings in two of this 
years most deadly storms in the midwest a flash flood in 
shadyside in june that killed 26 people and tornadoes in northern 
illinois in august that left 29 people dead 
for every five floods that cause at least 500000 in damage 
three occur without any warning the newspaper said 
the newspaper said its investigation was based on an analysis of 
weather service internal computer records and other data including 
statistics assembled from 1987 to 1989 by the services evaluation 
branch which grades forecasting offices and trains personnel for 
the nws office of meteorology 
for the last eight years the agencys own investigations of 
disaster foulups repeatedly have cited the same causes a shortage 
of forecasters obsolete equipment poor communications and in 
some cases incompetence 
as i look through status reports on existing systems i dont 
have a month go by in which we dont have at least a half a dozen 
radars around the country out for a significant period of time 
because of basic components weather service director elbert w 
friday jr told the newspaper 
he offered little hope for quick improvement 
were keeping the weather service tied together now ith the 
proverbial baling wire and chewing gum he said 
the weather service budget has had only slight budget increases 
in recent years and in some spending categories cuts have 
resulted in sharp personnel cutbacks the current 330 million 
operating budget gives the weather service the same buying power it 
had in the 1960s 
experts say that advances in technology allow forecasters to 
alert the public in advance of all severe thunderstorms and nearly 
all floods and large tornadoes the newspaper said 
friday acknowledged that despite antiquated equipment that is 
not to be replaced until 1995 weather offices should be able to 
issue warnings for 70 percent to 75 percent of all severe storms 
including tornadoes thunderstorms and flash floods 
data from the services evaluation branch shows that no warnings 
were issued for 68 percent of all tornadoes and 64 percent of all 
flash floods from 1987 to 1989 fiftyone percent of all flash 
flood warnings were issued after the floods began forecasters 
failed to warn of 17 out of 27 killer floods four of every five 
tornado warnings and six of every 10 flashflood warnings were 
false alarms 
even when tornado warnings were issued the public had only an 
average seven to 10 minutes to get to safety the figures showed 
were not doing too well said meteorologist bill lerner 
one of the weather services official scorekeepers in the services 
evaluation branch 
the weather service has however succeeded in the past 
in february 1982 weather service forecasters in fort wayne 
ind urged the mayor to prepare emergency shelters and fill 
sandbags seventeen days later they predicted a flood within 24 
hours and issued an official warning floods struck as predicted 
killing 12 but 15000 people had moved to shelters and local 
officials credited the forecasters with saving the city 
in addition some of the services 249 forecasting offices do 
better than others the newspaper said 
in shreveport la forecasters have accurately issued warnings 
for more than 80 percent of all storms there said chief forecaster 
ernest ethridge 
by contrast chicagos weather office which failed to warn of 
the aug 28 tornado that killed 29 people has the worst record in 
the nation the newspaper said in the last three years it has 
issued warnings for only 24 percent of all severe storms in its 
jurisdiction

opportunity commission said sunday the federal government will 
begin prosecuting job discrimination cases in which individuals 
used as testers by civil rights groups charge they have been 
illegally denied employment 
the new policy extends the use of testers long a tactic in 
housing discrimination suits to the federal employment bias arena 
for the first time 
its used in housing cases and used by other state agencies 
and i couldnt see why it couldnt be used by the commission 
evan j kemp jr chairman of the eeoc said in a telephone 
interview 
testers or individuals from minority and womens groups 
who historically have been victims of discrimination have posed 
as renters or home buyers to win housing discrimination suits 
the supreme court in 1982 said such activities were legal even 
if the testers did not intend to rent or buy 
however the government never has used the testimony of testers 
to prosecute job discrimination cases 
kemp said the new commission policy announced friday would 
address one of the weaknesses of the eeoc system 
people that apply for a job in answer to a newspaper ad can be 
discriminated against and they wont know it under current 
circumstances kemp said 
the eeoc chairman said he was confident his agency has the legal 
authority to bring the cases because the courts address this all 
the time and make a determination whether an employer has 
discriminated or not 
representatives of the business community could not be reached 
for comment sunday on the new policy 
but stephen bokat of the us chamber of commerce told the 
washington post that proving the case of job bias against an 
employment tester would be infinitely more difficult than it is 
in the housing context 
in housing the only issue is whether someone is financially 
capable of paying the rent on the property or buying a piece of 
property bokat was quoted as saying in sundays editions of the 
newspaper 
in job testing cases there are all sorts of things how 
articulate the person is lots more subjective considerations 
that go into a decision bokat said 
kemp admitted there may be some difficulties in implementing the 
policy and said his agency was still deciding how were going to 
work it 
there are no current tests set up kemp said but the agency 
would initiate proceedings on charges brought by civil rights and 
community groups 
kemp said the policy was prompted by the case brought by city 
and state authorities against a temporary employment agency in new 
york city after a report on cbstvs 60 minutes program showing 
the use of testers 
kemp said he expects the policy to come up during previously 
scheduled meetings with representatives of several womens groups 
on tuesday

polands roman catholic bishops will for 
the first time issue a pastoral letter attacking the antisemitism 
that has darkened the countrys name for centuries 
the letter to be read at all masses on sunday jan 20 is the 
most explicit statement on catholicjewish relations ever issued by 
the polish church 
the move comes as antisemitism is reappearing in the nations 
political life in the postcommunist era it also follows criticism 
from international jewish groups who say they are dismayed by 
church footdragging and concerned about whether its january 
statement will condemn specific antisemitic incidents 
the episcopate commission for dialogue with judaism told the 
official pap news agency saturday that the pastoral letter 
expresses regret over any instances of antisemitism on polish 
soil 
it said the letter recalls polishborn pope john paul iis 
teaching that antisemitism contradicts christian values 
the letter which caps two years of work by the commission and 
is endorsed by the bishops council can be expected to carry 
enormous weight among poles 93 percent of whom consider themselves 
catholic 
the text was not disclosed but the rev stanislaw musial the 
commission secretary recently issued the first statement by a 
ranking church official on polish catholic culpability in the nazi 
extermination of 3 million polish jews during world war ii he also 
spoke of discrimination in poland before and after the war 
for every pole of christian faith who did not stretch his 
helpful hand to you in those days and after who betrayed you to 
the nazis who tried to enrich himself on your fear and 
loneliness for all these we beg your pardon the priest wrote 
in the influential catholic tygodnik powszechny weekly 
sources in polands religious communities acknowledged there was 
disagreement among the bishops about how strong a statement to 
issue 
jewish groups generally praised the latest plans but questioned 
whether they are enough 
i am very glad something like this will be done and i hope it 
will be sufficiently specific to hit the consciences of many of the 
churchgoers said stanislaw krajewski representative of the 
american jewish congress in poland and a leader of its tiny jewish 
community 
but i really hope that some specific things are said that 
jew is used as a word of abuse more generally and that the 
unfortunate issue of who is jewish was so heavily used during 
the presidential campaign 
during the current presidential campaign rumors circulated that 
the catholic prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki was jewish or that 
jews dominated his government 
mazowieckis defeat in the first round of voting nov 25 was 
attributed mainly to discontent with economic reforms however 
the american jewish congress in midnovember questioned the 
delay in issuing the catholic document and said the current 
resurgence of antisemitism in poland has not been sufficiently 
addressed by the church 
jews have lived in poland since the 13th century in the middle 
ages the country was a haven for some jews fleeing persecution 
elsewhere in europe although even then they suffered widespread 
discrimination 
polands 35 million jews were onetenth of the population in 
1939 only about 500000 survived the war 
afterward some were threatened and even killed when coming home 
to recover family property waves of emigration including a 1968 
communistbacked purge have reduced the jewish population to a few 
thousand mostly elderly people

trade ministers searched on sunday for 
an 11thhour miracle to rescue stalled free trade talks but failed 
to make any progress on the biggest stumbling block how to reduce 
costly farm subsidies 
there was some progress reported on another dispute involving 
removing barriers to trade in financial services but a series of 
meetings on the agriculture question yielded no results 
the activity came as delegates from 107 nations prepared to open 
five days of formal negotiations monday in hopes of completing a 
fouryear effort to overhaul the world trading system 
the talks known as the uruguay round for the nation where they 
began in 1986 were being held under the auspices of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade 
australian trade minister neal blewett chairman of the cairns 
group of 14 major farmexporting countries said the entire 
bargaining effort was in deep crisis he said what happens over 
the next 48 hours would likely decide whether the negotiations 
could succeed 
there is a general recognition that agriculture is at the 
heart of the crisis and that blockage is poisoning other parts 
of the negotiations he told reporters 
the cairns group supported by the united states is attempting 
to scale back agriculture subsidies which cost consumers and 
taxpayers 250 billion annually 
however the 12nation european community and japan have 
resisted contending the measures go too far and would cause 
massive political unrest among farm groups in their nations 
us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter held what he termed 
sparring sessions with both ray macsharry the ecs agriculture 
chief and japanese agriculture minister tomio yamamoto he said 
that neither the europeans nor the japanese were signalling any 
willingness to compromise 
unless both japan and the european community begin to 
demonstrate greater commitment to trade liberalization in 
agriculture i see no way of reaching an overall uruguay round 
agreement yeutter said 
the united states and the cairns group are pushing a proposal 
that would cut export subsidies by 90 percent while reducing 
internal farm support payments and barriers to farm imports by 75 
percent 
the united states has also been lobbying heavily to get japan to 
show good faith in the farm area by removing its ban on the import 
of rice a barrier that forces japanese consumers to pay seven 
times the world market price 
without an agreement in agriculture us trade representative 
carla hills said third world nations would walk away from the 
bargaining table dooming the most ambitious reform effort in 43 
years 
on another dispute officials reported some progress sunday in 
an effort to get countries to extend the gatt coverage to trade in 
service industries such as banking and insurance 
canadian trade minister john crosbie told reporters that canada 
with the support of several other countries would put forward a 
proposal monday to address removing barriers in financial services 
he said the measure had the support of both the united states and 
the ec 
but with just five days to go until the negotiations are 
scheduled to conclude friday there were still many blank spaces in 
the draft 291page agreement prompting a growing sense of failure 
we are going to do our best to try to make it work but it is 
going to take an 11thhour miracle said us commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher one of four members of president bushs cabinet 
in brussels for the negotiations 
this is the eighth round of negotiations aimed at lowering 
tariff and nontariff barriers to trade 
the negotiators are also attempting to extend gatts rules to 
trade in services as well as writing rules to govern the theft on 
intellectual property rights principally by third world nations 
such thefts of copyrights and patents cost american businesses an 
estimated 60 billion annually 
in all 107 nations from austria to zimbabwe are involved in the 
negotiations either as fullfledged members of gatt or observers 
a category that includes china

to the soviet people from the people of the 
united states with love read the banners on 40 tons of donated 
food and medical supplies that arrived in moscow sunday 
it was the first of many shipments planned by the 
connecticutbased aid organization americares to help relieve 
soviet citizens faced with barren grocery shelves and severe 
shortages of imported medicines 
soviet television showed soldiers and students unloading cartons 
of medical supplies from the southern air transport cargo plane 
dr vasily drozdov head of the republican childrens clinic 
said the medicine for children under the age of three arrived at 
his hospital late sunday 
the soviet unions chronic shortages of food and medicine have 
worsened dramatically this winter consumers must wait in long 
lines often for as long as three hours for basics such as 
butter sometimes pushing and shoving breaks out over a scarce 
item 
the shortages are caused in part by the countrys transition 
from a centralized planning system to a free market which has not 
yet taken hold the centralized distribution system is breaking 
down in anticipation of changes 
a shortage of foreign currency that forced a cut in imports 
earlier this year has also caused shortages although president 
mikhail s gorbachev has now won promises of billions of dollars of 
new credits and aid from abroad 
in addition the country doesnt have enough rail cars or 
refrigerated trucks to transport food from the fields to markets 
nor are there sufficient storage facilities theft and diversion to 
the black market is rampant 
thus despite normal levels of food production and a spectacular 
grain crop food is not reaching consumers at the usual subsidized 
prices 
prime minister nikolai ryzhkov gave a televised address after 
the evening news sunday calling on people to work together to 
overcome the food crisis 
everyone is pulling in different directions he said 
referring to individual republics and regions that are refusing to 
sell their food to other districts 
soviet television said americares plans to send 450 tons of food 
and medicine americares representative ty cordova said he would 
stay and supervise up to the last shipment to ensure the supplies 
are not lost in the black market or in the constant breakdowns of 
the soviet cargo transport system 
drozdov said his clinic so far had received only medicine and 
no food we dont really need food at the moment nutrition at 
the clinic is all right he said 
doctors from the mayo clinic in minnesota and memorial 
sloankettering cancer center in new york city traveled with the 
americares staffers and will discuss further supply needs with 
soviet medical specialists 
americares representatives in the united states said an 
80000pound shipment of food and medical supplies was to be given 
to the clinic and two orphanages in moscow another 250000 pounds 
of supplies is scheduled to be sent to the soviet union on dec 26 
a spokesman for americares said saturday 
since the armenian earthquake two years ago americares has sent 
at least 15 shipments of aid to the soviet union 
another planeload of food arrived from germany on friday for 
distribution among hospitals and orphanages italy and austria have 
also promised food and medical supplies

saddam hussein said in a television interview aired 
sunday that he believes the chances of war in the persian gulf 
stand at fiftyfifty but that he is open to talks 
the iraqi leader also said iraq does not posses nuclear arms 
and he defended the holding of foreign hostages 
the interview with the french network antenne 2 was the first 
saddam has granted to a foreign television network since the un 
security council last week adopted a resolution authorizing force 
against iraq if its troops remained in kuwait as of jan 15 
the iraqi president repeatedly refused to respond to questions 
about a possible iraqi withdrawal from kuwait which his forces 
have occupied since aug 2 
but in the interview taped in baghdad saturday saddam said he 
was ready to talk with us officials if they came in a spirit of 
dialogue and did not set preconditions 
he said the holding of an estimated 3000 western hostages was 
one of the means that we think is capable of preventing war 
he said if the united states wanted the hostages freed it 
should pledge that it will not resort to force prior to march 25 
the iraqi president had offered earlier to free all the hostages 
between christmas and march 25 if nothing happens to mar the 
atmosphere of peace 
the antenne 2 interviewer asked saddam about the chances of war 
in the region fiftyfifty the iraqi leader replied 
elaborating on that he cited the us offer to send secretary 
of state james a baker iii to baghdad for talks 
if they want to make this meeting a raal path toward dialogue 
then we are closer to peace he said 
but if they want to make this meeting nothing other than a 
formal exhibition for the american congress the american people or 
international public opinion simply to give themselves good 
conscience to say there weve tried to dialogue with iraq 
without iraq renouncing its positions in that case were closer 
to war 
saddam denied that his government possessed nuclear weapons but 
said he would let the world know if that were the case 
but we dont possess nuclear arms he said 
us officials have raised the possibility of iraq developing 
nuclear capability in coming years and said that would be one 
reason to move against saddam

us and philippine negotiators will 
tackle the difficult issue of compensation when they resume talks 
this week on the future of six american military bases in this 
country 
in preparation for the talks which filipino sources say will 
resume tuesday us officials restricted the movements of the 
40000 us troops pentagon civilians and military dependents 
living here 
last may communist rebels killed two us airmen near clark air 
base on the eve of an opening round of talks despite a standing 
threat from the new peoples army there were no attacks against 
americans during later sessions in september and november 
at issue in the talks is the future of clark air base the subic 
bay naval base and four smaller installations the americans hold 
under an agreement that expires in september 
foreign secretary raul manglapus the chief philippine 
negotiator has demanded philippine control over clark and the 
smaller bases next year 
but the government has left open the possibility of extending 
the us stay at subic considered the most strategic installation 
for 57 years filipino officials have said they might let the 
americans keep access to clark on a commercial basis 
chief us negotiator richard armitage has acknowledged the 
american military presence will be scaled down under any new 
agreement but us officials would like a phasedown period to 
vacate the bases followed by an arrangement under which the 
americans maintain a residual presence 
philippine officials say the upcoming round will discuss how 
much the americans will pay for use of the facilities us sources 
familiar with the talks say the philippine panel has so far not 
raised the compensation issue or given any indication of what it 
considers an acceptable figure 
in 1988 the reagan administration agreed to seek 960 million 
in aid over two years for use of the bases through 1991 
but last year congress cut the bush administrations aid 
request for the philippines provoking charges that the united 
states had reneged on its pledge 
the philippines would like the new agrement to include 
ironclad guarantees of aid american officials have consistently 
refused to go beyond a pledge to exert their best efforts to 
meet aid targets 
this time we are not talking about an executive agreement but 
a treaty and the best efforts device is not applicable 
manglapus said in a recent interview 
an acceptable compensation arrangement is considered critical to 
prospects for approval of the new agreement in the philippine 
senate 
under the 1987 constitution any new agreement must be covered 
within a formal treaty ratified by twothirds of the 23member 
philippine senate 
previously the status of us bases was formalized under an 
executive agreement between chief executives of the two countries 
last week an informal survey conducted by senate president 
jovito salonga found 12 senators opposed to allowing the americans 
to stay beyond the september deadline that would be enough to 
defeat any agreement allowing us forces to remain 
but diplomatic observers believe an acceptable compensation 
package perhaps including trade concessions rather than cash 
would sway enough senators to win agreement 
compensation has become all the more urgent for the philippines 
because of the countrys economic crisis worsened by the rise in 
world petroleum prices and the effects of an earthquake that killed 
nearly 1700 people last july 
finance secretary jesus estanislao and others fear that the 
americans would not exert their influence with the international 
monetary fund and other lending institutions on behalf of this 
country if no agreement on the bases can be reached 
in addition recent surveys show growing probases sentiment 
among the 61 million filipinos if the final package appears 
favorable to the philippines some senators may switch their stand 
rather than face the electorate in the 1992 elections after voting 
to shut down the installations

thousands of marine reservists 
uprooted from their homes and families accepted their pending 
participation in operation desert shield with a mixture of 
resignation and understanding 
we all signed up for it and now weve got to do it said 
22yearold lance cpl kevin nobis of waterloo iowa 
between 10000 and 12000 of the 43000 marine corps reservists 
in the united states will call this eastern north carolina base 
home during an intense training period before their likely 
deployment to the middle east later this month said lejeune 
spokesman maj jay farrar 
the first group arrived nov 26 and the camp lejeune military 
processing center has inoculated shaved shorn and dogtagged 
about 1000 a day since 
this event is brought to you by saddam hussein reads a sign 
inside the center just above a cartoon depicting the iraq leader in 
a gun sight 
we sent out roughly 10000 marines when this began farrar 
said now were bringing that many through again 
about 80 percent of the marine reserves called to action will 
join with active duty troops for two to four weeks training 
people think the reserves are just weekend warriors but we 
really train hard and we know how to do the job we just need some 
practice lance cpl richard nordenbrook 21 of fairfax va 
said sunday at an antitank missile practice range 
people always talk about them being weekend warriors said 
active duty marine lt mike nosbisch 24 of buffalo ny but 
theyve got a mission here too and that mission is to go to war 
whether or not people want to hear that thats what it is 
about 50 men trained with live missiles for the first time since 
the reservists arrived a week ago 
as the reserves sat nearby observing the exercise mortar shells 
exploded about 1000 meters out into the practice range providing a 
smoke screen as two armored trucks carrying antitank tow missiles 
raced out of hiding and into position 
the reservists sat out of the action but if the camp lejeune 
unit goes to saudi arabia their newest members will go right along 
with them 
if my country needs me then im here said nordenbrook 
none of the active duty troops want to go either but none of us 
are complaining

the earth stood still sunday as usual 
the only thing moving was the stream of jumpy residents fleeing in 
fear of an earthquake 
new mexico scientist iben browning projected a 5050 chance of a 
major temblor along the new madrid fault for the five days that 
began saturday the faults southern end is under this town of 
about 3200 people it runs northeast to cairo ill 
browning 72 bases his theory on the gravitational pull of the 
sun and moon which he says will be particularly strong during the 
period 
on the basis of that dozens of people have packed their things 
and left town 
scientists have scoffed at his projection but these same 
scientists say an earthquake is likely someday 
so even skeptical residents like convenience store cashier 
rheba womack arent taking any chances 
if this doesnt happen i dont want to hear anything else 
about earthquakes mrs womack said 
a few hours later on saturday night mrs womack and her 
husband scott left town joining the temporary migration 
those who stayed prayed 
bless all of us oh father that are upset about the 
earthquake said ira whitfield when he oened sunday school at 
st john missionary baptist church 
church deacon sterling ivy said he had expected the crowd to be 
smaller than usual it was what with some people suddenly out of 
town and others afraid to leave their houses 
the same concern has closed schools in parts of tennessee 
arkansas missouri kentucky and illinois for a few days early this 
week 
judy byrd of evansville ind isnt waiting for local school 
administrators to decide though she said she doesnt believe 
earthquakes can be projected her 11yearold son wont be in 
school monday 
he asked me if he could stay home mrs byrd said at this 
age they really worry about everything war an earthquake water 
the environment i figured if he really was that worried about it 
it should be up to him 
other people were looking for a more precise warning 
in illinois st clair county residents were watching cats 
dogs and cows for signs of nervousness 
if we notice any exceptional behavior we will not hold school 
monday said superintendent bill gullick of the countys marissa 
community unit school district 40 
the chinese have been using that method to anticipate 
earthquakes for more than 1000 years gullick said 
some people here have chosen to stay put what theyre afraid 
of they say is worse than any earthquake looters and bad 
publicity for the town 
police officer jay woods said looting hasnt been a problem 
especially with a lot of people gone 
i stopped a lady for speeding last night and she said 
officer im just in a hurry to get through marked tree 
woods couldnt bring himself to write her a ticket he said 
while residents wrestled with their anxieties about whether to 
stay or go emergency experts in arkansas were busy sunday planning 
for an earthquake they could believe in 
in an earthquake disaster drill planned long before brownings 
projection officials were assessing an imaginary toll of death and 
destruction from a hypothetical earthquake on paper the quake 
laid waste to much of the northeastern part of the state 
the drill involving the arkansas national guard and other state 
and federal agencies was based on a worstcase scenario of an 
earthquake measuring 76 on the richter scale 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph 
the makebelieve quake hit friday by sunday according to the 
drills script the toll in eastern arkansas had reached 4950 
dead 25097 seriously injured and 98020 left homeless 
realistically we would still be in a search and rescue mode 
said gary talley of the arkansas office of emergency services 
which coordinated the drill

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki on 
sunday urged supporters of his failed presidential bid to vote for 
lech walesa but called for creation of a new political party to 
oppose the solidarity leader in the future 
in the face of the irresponsibility that may endanger poland 
and everything we have been struggling for 10 years we should cast 
our ballots in favor of mr walesa said mazowiecki at the 
founding of the new union of polish democracy 
the prime minister referred to the campaign of stanislaw 
tyminski the wealthy emigre who came from obscurity to reach the 
presidential runoff election on sunday dec 9 
this does not mean an agreement with his vision of democracy 
in poland and his style of action mazowiecki said of walesa 
mazowiecki was an adviser of walesas for nine years until 
becoming the east blocs first noncommunist prime minister in 
august 1989 mazowiecki has said he will leave office when the new 
president is chosen 
despite his thirdplace showing in the first round of the 
presidential elections nov 25 the prime minister received a 
heros welcome from about 1000 supporters at warsaw university on 
sunday 
he was cheered for five minutes in the crowded hall when he 
appeared and frequently was interrupted by applause as he spoke to 
the audience that included members of his election campaign 
committees 
we didnt win mazowiecki said but our rationales exist 
and are deeply rooted in the society our most important task today 
is to keep together those millions of friends and to create a 
political formation i am convinced that we will be a key 
element on the polish political scene 
the party later was officially founded by acclamation by members 
of mazowieckis campaign committees and representatives of two 
other promazowiecki groups present the citizens movement for 
democratic action and the forum of the democratic right 
meanwhile walesa adviser zdzislaw najder addressing a 
conference of local citizens committees criticized mazowieckis 
camp for having denigrated the solidarity leader as unpredictable 
and unsteerable in the first round 
in other political developments walesa remained in warsaw after 
a saturday evening news conference with tyminski and planned to 
attend the funeral of a roman catholic bishop tyminski scheduled 
an evening rally in the northeastern city of bialystok 
earlier tyminski went to the 10th anniversary gathering of the 
communistbacked union of rural youth in warsaw among guests at 
the gathering was waldemar swirgon a former central committee 
secretary and leader of the main communist youth organizations in 
the late 1970s and 1980s the official pap news agency reported 
tyminski has been criticized for ties to the former communist 
elite in poland walesa has termed his candidacy an attempted 
counterrevolution but tyminski says he accepts support from 
various quarters 
a scheduled nationally televised debate between walesa and 
tyminski on sunday night did not take place tyminski had insisted

five college students were surprised 
shivering and shaking when they emerged unscathed after being 
trapped by a flash flood for more than seven hours in the depths of 
a milelong cave 
we were all very scared scott baisch a senior at syracuse 
university said sunday we thought we would die there 
baisch and four companions had entered onesquethaw cave located 
in an isolated area about 10 miles southwest of albany about 2 
pm saturday 
they became trapped a little more than two hours later when a 
beaver dam on a tiny lake about three miles from the cave entrance 
burst sending a torrent of water cascading down a stream bed and 
into the 50footdeep cave 
the cave began to flood when the three men and two women were 
about threequarters of the way in 
the students had last been seen entering the cave early saturday 
afternoon by another party of spelunkers from massachusetts who 
alerted police after the dam burst 
state police divers and other rescuers entered the cave early 
saturday evening but were turned back by high water after 
exploring nearly 500 feet 
divers and experienced spelunkers eventually made it in as far 
as 850 feet but the searches were called off temporarily about 9 
pm while authorities worked feverishly to shore up the dam with 
shale to prevent it from collapsing again 
we all thought we were going to drown said lynn cowan a 
student at columbia university who said shes through spelunking 
at first i just panicked i had never really considered that i 
could die this young 
besides baisch and cowan the group consisted of laura selicaro 
and nicholas springer both syracuse students and peter bowie a 
student at cornell university 
the five who said they huddled in a pile to stay warm and 
exercised periodically to ward off hypothermia walked out shortly 
after 11 pm as search parties were awaiting the goahead to 
reenter the cave 
horns from several emergency vehicles blared in celebration and 
about 100 rescue workers cheered the students were taken to local 
hospitals observed for exposure and released 
they knew what happened with the water coming in and they 
just waited it out like they should have and just walked out 
said rick russo of albany county dive rescue they were more 
apologetic than anything when they walked out and saw everybody 
around 
they kept saying were sorry and we said its no 
problem youre alive

japanese and the first journalist of any nationality traveled 
into space as a paying passenger aboard a soviet rocket 
television reporter toyohiro akiyamas company tbs paid 12

altogether on the project in the streets of tokyo japanese 
clustered around television sets the company had placed at

with singleminded determination and a huge infusion of cash 
the company assigned 270 staffers to the story 170 in the soviet 
union and 100 in tokyo many employees wear badges reading earth 
we love the projects slogan 
with so much money and effort being expended tbs offered what 
amounted to saturation coverage 
television viewers saw akiyama board the craft and heard him say 
his farewell a quick ittekimasu the standard japanese phrase 
on setting out that translates roughly as back later 
he made his first report two hours after the launch 
right now i am flying over the soviet union it is becoming 
evening what i can see from the window is darkness there is a 
hazy blue earth below blackish dark blue the earth is blue 
after all he said 
although much of tbs coverage of akiyamas trip will be 
exclusive other stations were being supplied with footage for news 
purposes 
the japan broadcasting corp the national public television 
network showed the liftoff on its evening news but led off its 
newscast with another story japanese hostages families visiting 
them in iraq

berlin voters on sunday gave conservatives the 
upper hand in the first allberlin elections in 44 years according 
to computer projections 
the voting marked the final return of berlin to the citys 4 
million people after decades of serving as a pawn of the 
superpowers 
where soviet soldiers once faced off against us british and 
french forces across the berlin wall there is now one united city 
both the zdf and ard tv networks projected that the christian 
democratic union under former mayor eberhard diepgen would win 
401 percent of the vote and take first place 
but the party needs support to form a majority in the city 
government diepgen said his party might try to form a grand 
coalition with the leftist social democrats who were projected 
to win 303 percent of the vote for second place 
a difficult negotiating period is in the offing said the 
ard television network 
last months street battles between berlin police and squatters 
caused the collapse of the leftist coalition that had governed the 
city the local greens the environmentalists had accused social 
democratic mayor walter momper of sending in police units to oust 
the squatters without consulting the coalitions junior partners 
the christian democrats in turn had played on voters fears of 
growing lawlessness 
berlins results reflected the nationwide voting trends which 
gave a resounding victory to the leader of the christian democrats 
chancellor helmut kohl 
we have another large reason to be happy kohl told cheering 
supporters in bonn and thats the result in berlin 
up until last fall the authoritarian communist party had ruled 
in east berlin 
democratically elected governments governed west berlin under 
the protection of the victorious world war ii allies france 
britain and the united states 
berlin has been the focus of many of the problems of german 
unification which has strained housing and social services people 
in former east berlin are demanding a quick improvement of their 
dismal standard of living 
in berlin we have to solve a lot of the problems of the 
growing together of the two countries more quickly than 
elsewhere diepgen said there is social tension

a general strike on sunday idled israels 
airports curtailed radio broadcasts and shut schools offices and 
clinics in a dispute over tax increases and the minimum wage 
more than 500000 israeli government employees heeded the strike 
call by the histadrut labor federation after the cabinet added a 
5percent levy to income taxes to finance soviet immigration the 
levy was part of a broader package of austerity measures 
flights carrying immigrants were to be diverted to military 
airfields said israel army radio which was not affected by the 
walkout workers in essential services heeded government 
backtowork orders 
officials of the jewish agency which sees to bringing the 
immigrants to israel stayed on the job saying they did not want to 
add to the newcomers difficulties 
originally the strike was supposed to last 24 hours but after 
overnight negotiations broke down in disagreement sunday morning 
union leaders said it would continue until a settlement was 
reached 
the main dispute is a government plan to cut the minimum wage by 
about 20 percent from 520 a month to 417 and a 20 percent tax on 
pension savings 
these are painful issues the workers cannot be pushed to the 
wall said yisrael kessar general secretary of the histadrut an 
umbrella organization for most of the nations workforce 
aryeh stein a spokesman for the clerks unions said the 
pension taxes in effect meant an additional 5 percent pay cut to 
wage earners seeking to maintain their pension levels 
we dont object to the special levy for immigrants but this 
should be instead of other taxes and not in addition to them 
stein said in an interview 
prime minister yitzhak shamir urged negotiations to continue 
through sunday to resolve the dispute 
the histadrut represents about 15 million workers but those 
employed in private business were exempted from striking keeping 
most banks open and public buses running

secretary of state james baker a iii assured 
iraq on sunday the united states will not attack that nation if 
saddam hussein withdraws his troops from kuwait and frees the 
western hostages 
baker who is preparing to visit iraq before jan 15 for talks 
on the gulf crisis made the promise to saddam the iraqi 
president while insisting there will be no negotiating on the 
substance of the un resolutions calling for iraq to get out of 
kuwait 
an iraqi official hinting that a resolution was possible to the 
increasingly tense international standoff over kuwait said his 
country was willing to discuss all the issues 
previously saddam has claimed that kuwait had been annexed as a 
new province of iraq 
as he left washington sunday evening for brazile president bush 
declined to respond directly to reporters questions about details 
of pending talks im very pleased with the way its going but 
well see was his only response 
if saddam meets the un conditions withdrawal from kuwait 
freedom for hostages and the restoration of kuwaits legitimate 
government then there can be discussions of iraqi grievances 
against kuwait baker said on nbctvs meet the press program 
he said talks should be between kuwait and iraq which claims 
kuwait is siphoning oil from an oil field along their common 
border iraq also contends it was denied a viable port on the 
persian gulf when kuwait was created in 1961 
moreover baker said the united states would not launch an 
attack against iraq to drie saddam from power if the un 
conditions are met 
theres never been any suggestion that force would be used if 
the un resolutions were fully complied with baker said 
that would give some assurance it seems to me that if he 
complied with the resolutions his reward for that would not be a 
military attack by the united states baker said 
iraq on saturday said it was willing to receive baker as long as 
the talks were tied with a resolution of israels occupation of 
arab lands but baker rejected that demand 
baker called the issues two entirely different questions and 
were not here to link them 
the un security council passed a resolution last week setting 
a jan 15 deadline for the use of force against iraq if no saddam 
doesnt withdraw from kuwait and baker along with defense 
secretary dick cheney and national security adviser brent 
scowcroft on sunday elaborated on bushs efforts to find a 
peaceful solution to the crisis 
aside from offering to send baker to baghdad bush said friday 
he would ask iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz to come to 
washington next week for talks on the gulf 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas suggested sunday 
that congressional leaders also go to iraq to show support for 
bushs efforts 
baker said officials were discussing arrangements for the 
baghdad and washington meetings assuming that the meetings are 
going to take place 
bushs diplomatic gesture followed a week of hearings on capitol 
hill during which several former highranking military officers 
urged the administration to show restraint and give economic 
sanctions against iraq more time to work the hearings resume 
monday with testimony by the administration 
but baker said there was an excellent chance saddam would 
withdraw from kuwait once he understands the depth of opposition to 
him 
a usled multinational force has arrayed more than 350000 
troops against saddam in the persian gulf us forces now 
numbering more than 240000 are expected to swell to around 
400000 by next month 
abdul amir anbari the iraqi ambassador to the united nations 
was asked if his country was prepared to talk about withdrawing 
from kuwait 
we would be willing to talk about all the issues that exist in 
the region he said on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
program 
our president made it quite clear that there is no 
exception and we make no reservation and no condition he said 
when pressed on the issue 
some american officials have questioned whether the middle east 
will ever be safe as long as saddam remains in power possesses 
chemical weapons and is encouraging a nuclear program 
cheney on the abc said the overall focus of us policy is 
the longterm proposition if saddam hussein is not stopped its 
the prospect of having a man who has acquired an enormous force 
he said 
in august bush said some countries around the world hope 
saddam would be overthrown by his own people and he has said that 
iraqs nuclear program is a threat 
while the united states remains concerned about saddams 
weapons baker said we would have to find a way to address those 
issues in the aftermath of a resolution of the kuwaiti crisis 
the three us officials raised doubts about the sanctions 
against iraq which sen edward kennedy dmass a member of the 
senate armed services committee has encouraged 
i want to see sanctions work kennedy said on nbc they 
are effective i believe we can avoid war and i believe it is 
important we do avoid war

rebel leader idriss deby entered the 
capital in triumph sunday and vowed to establish a new government 
conflicting reports emerged over the fate of deposed president 
hissene habre 
a libyan news agency said habre was killed near the sudanese 
border but diplomats and other sources said habre and his family 
flew in a military plane to cameroon west of chad before dawn 
saturday neither report could be independently verified 
deby who helped habre lead a coup in 1982 arrived in ndjamena 
in a black mercedes escorted by allterrain vehicles he refused 
to recognize the remnants of habres government as the countrys 
legitimate authority but declared his patriotic salvation movement 
would institute a democracy 
there were no immediate reports of deaths in the takeover but 
the french relief agency doctors without borders said it treated 
120 people hurt in rioting saturday 
my worry is not to be president of the republic said deby 
who served as habres chief military adviser from 1982 to 1989 
this country must become democratic pluralist the moment has 
come to lay down our arms 
deby did not rule out being president but said the decision 
would rest with his party he said he wants to meet with alingue 
bawayeu president of chads national assembly and the 
highestranking politician left in the capital 
deby also urged reconciliation with goukouni oueddei the 
president he and habre toppled in 1982 oueddei is exiled in libya 
on sunday deby met french ambassador francoisxavier gendreau 
the ambassador however declined to say whether he tried to 
persuade deby to negotiate with bawayeu 
last year habre accused deby of plotting a coup and deby fled 
to sudan and organized a rebel movement against his onetime ally 
the official libyan news agency jana said habre and several 
aides had been killed between tine and oum chalouba in eastern 
chad the site of heavy fighting between government soldiers and 
rebel fighters last week 
the reports by news media on the escape of habre with his 
family on board an aircraft to a neighboring country were not 
true said jana monitored in rome the news agency cited no 
sources and did not say when habre had been killed it provided no 
further details 
but a patriotic salvation movement communique claimed habre had 
sought refuge in maroua cameroon about 185 miles south of 
ndjamena 
nothing confirms that he died in any fighting french 
foreign minister roland dumas said in paris during a televised 
interview i even have information to the contrary 
diplomatic sources also said most of habres cabinet ministers 
left the capital by vehicle 
though the rebels have been armed by libya in the past it is 
unclear how much help they have received recently from tripoli 
libya has denied any involvement in the rebels recent offensive 
in its dispatches sunday however the libyan news agency jana 
called habre a brigand and hailed the victory of the rebels 
habre was an obstacle in the way of national reconciliation 
between chadians and an obstacle to good neighborliness and the 
bonds of history and common suffering between libyans and 
chadians jana said in the commentary 
about 1000 civilians cheered deby as his mercedesled motorcade 
pulled into the place des martyrs the central square in the city 
of 400000 people others waved and cried out from the streets the 
capital was calm after being pillaged saturday by looters and army 
deserters 
debys secondincommand bada maldom arrived at the head of an 
army of 200 men earlier sunday 
he held several hours of talks with bawayeu at a hotel before 
deby arrived no details of the talks were disclosed but they were 
presumed to concern a handover of power 
under chads constitution bawayeu leads the country in the 
presidents absence 
the rebels meanwhile spread throughout the city taking 
control of public buildings and key intersections 
theyve moved in and theyre beginning to take over key 
points around the city a us embassy official said on condition 
of anonymity theres an effort to exert public order 
three companies of foreign legion soldiers landed in ndjamena 
on sunday reinforcing frances total troop strength in its former 
colony to 1800 men this north african country has about 52 
million people 
before the arrival of the bulk of debys rebels sunday the 
legionnaires appeared the sole sign of authority maldom asked 
french commanders permission before entering the city 
on saturday the legionnaires organized chad government troops 
led by officers sympathetic to deby to impose an overnight curfew 
and disarm looters 
most looters were renegade soldiers or civilians who had picked 
up weapons thrown down by thousands of army deserters saturday 
france has deployed soldiers in chad under a defense treaty 
they have taken no part in the fighting which paris views as a 
chadian affair 
the legionnaires organized the evacuation of 948 foreigners to 
paris on two flights sunday most of the evacuees were french 
nationals but about 50 american dependents were on the flights

columbias astronauts thrilled to 
finally be orbiting earth activated telescopes inside the space 
shuttle sunday for more than a week of probing galaxies quasars 
and other hot turbulent objects 
the shuttle roared to life at 149 am est sunday and streaked 
through a moonlit sky after six months of trying to get off the 
ground three hours later the sevenman crew began the daylong 
process of getting the 150 million astro observatory ready for 
operation 
its like an early christmas present nasa launch director 
bob sieck said at a postlaunch news conference its been a goal 
all year to get astro and columbia on orbit you could say it 
took all year to get there but were there and were sure happy 
about it 
it was the fifth launch attempt for the mission first scheduled 
for 1986 but postponed by the challenger accident fuel leaks 
halted three countdowns including the first one in may and 
telescope problems ended another 
thick clouds on sunday threatened to cause yet another delay 
the air force which is responsible for range safety dispatched a 
helicopter to assure visibility would be sufficient that check 
postponed liftoff 21 minutes 
less than 1 hours after columbia lifted off a soviet rocket 
hurtled into orbit with two cosmonauts and a japanese television 
journalist who will join two other men at space station mir 
twelve people consequently are now in space the most at one 
time and the americans are hoping to communicate with their soviet 
and japanese counterparts by ham radio during the mission 
scientists who have been working for years on the astro project 
said they could hardly believe it when columbia finally took off 
we were so used to not getting it off the idea that its 
actually been launched and its up there orbiting the earth is 
amazing said arthur davidsen of johns hopkins university 
principal investigator for one of the telescopes 
were working minor problems and were delighted to be working 
them after 11 years believe me said mission scientist ted gull 
the first difficulty involved the instrument pointing system for 
the three ultraviolet telescopes the systems star trackers failed 
to work properly in a stowed position but appeared to operate well 
after being elevated in the cargo bay said mission manager jack 
jones 
later in the day one of the three trackers had trouble 
detecting dim stars and was being readjusted to use brighter 
objects for calibration purposes 
the pointing system was used only once before for solar 
observations in 1985 numerous problems were encountered during 
that mission known as spacelab2 
i had visions of spacelab2 dancing in my head 
astronautastronomer robert parker told mission control 
there were some telescope problems later most of which were 
resolved quickly and a computer terminal in the flight deck was 
turned off after columbia commander vance brand smelled something 
burning the computer is believed to have overheated 
scientists still hoped to make their first scientific 
observation by early monday among the early targets are capella a 
nearby star in the constellation auriga with an ultravioletoozing 
corona and a supernova remnant in the constellation vela that is 
considered a bright xray source 
columbias seven astronauts are splitting 12hour shifts during 
the 10day mission the first shuttle trip in five years devoted 
entirely to scientific research 
parker and the three other astronomers on board will operate the 
ultraviolet telescopes roundtheclock the xray telescope will be 
managed by computer commands sent from goddard space flight center 
in greenbelt md 
the observatory will focus on about 240 highenergy objects in 
space such as quasars a supernova and even a comet as columbia 
orbits 218 miles high ultraviolet light and xrays emitted from 
such objects cannot penetrate earths atmosphere and thus are 
invisible from the ground 
scientists expect to improve their understanding of the 
socalled invisible universe by measuring ultraviolet and xray 
radiation in addition to stars and galaxies astro will examine 
jupiter as well as comet levy which is moving rapidly out of the 
solar system 
after a year of frustrations two leaky shuttles a flawed 
mirror on the hubble space telescope overhauled space station 
designs the astronomy mission is helping nasa finish the year on 
an upswing it is the third shuttle flight in as many months a 
pace not seen since 1985 
the soviet rocket which also launched a soviet effort to 
commercialize its space program lifted off from the remote 
central asian steppes of kazakhstan 
journalist toyohiro akiyama 48 joined soviet cosmonauts viktor 
afanasyev and musa manarov in the soyuz tm11 space capsule 
akiyama was a passenger under a 12 million contract between the 
soviet union and japans biggest private television company tbs 
akiyama a tbs news director who quit a fourpackaday 
cigarette habit during the training was asked before liftoff what 
he looked forward to most on his return from the first trip into 
space by a japanese citizen 
i cant wait to have a smoke he said

european community finance ministers sunday 
gave broad support to a proposal for a strong politically 
independent european central bank 
basically the general idea of the draft statute was supported 
by finance ministers today deutsche bundesbank president karl 
otto poehl told a news conference 
the draft statute sets price stability as its primary goal it 
says both the future european central bank and the national central 
banks should be free of any political influence 
the finance officials didnt take any vote however at the 
informal gathering sunday they forwarded the document for 
consideration at an ec summit in rome beginning dec 14 
the meeting was also attended by european central bank 
governors who had drafted the statutes last month 
the meeting marked the european debut of the british chancellor 
of the exchequer norman lamont lamont succeeded john major who 
last week became prime minister 
lamont told reporters following the meeting that he was 
hopeful a compromise might be reached at the rome summit but 
he maintained britains reserve against a single currency and a 
single european central bank 
prime minister margaret thatcher resistance to moves toward 
european unity helped push her from power last month 
at sundays meeting lamont said there are an immense number 
of very complicated issues to be steered through but added that 
there was sufficient ground for a constructive discussion 
its just my belief that we can find some common ground he 
said 
other officials at the meeting said they noted a change in the 
british position but it remained unclear whether it was a change 
in form or substance 
a number of issues remain yet to be settled however including 
the authority of the european central bank to independently conduct 
an exchange rate policy through interventions in the currency and 
monetary markets 
poehl downplayed the disagreement on this issue 
we all agree that price stability should be the main 
objective and not exchange rate stability poehl told the news 
conference 
the draft statute also states that official reserves of the 
national central banks would be transferred to the european central 
bank 
the central bank would be established during the socalled 
second phase toward economic and monetary union of the 12 ec 
members which will start jan 1 1994 
the rome summit will start drafting changes to the treaty of 
rome needed for the creation of an economic and monetary union the 
summit will also discuss the process toward political union in 
europe

mark david chapman who shot john lennon to 
death 10 years ago wants the world to know hes sorry 
you cant judge a mans life by one act before i became the 
man who murdered john lennon i was basically a decent person 
the rochester democrat and chronicle reported in its sunday 
edition 
chapman whos serving 20 years to life for killing the former 
beatle was interviewed in his isolated cell at attica state 
prison 
im not an evil person he said like everybody theres a 
small part within me thats evil and thats what took over in my 
case my energies turned foul and went toward something 
destructive 
chapman said he suffered years of mental dissolution before 
killing lennon little people would speak to him giving him 
advice on how to run his life he said 
chapman said he first got the idea for killing lennon when he 
came across a beatles picture book in a honolulu library 
i was looking for a way to vent all the disappointment my 
anger my rage he said a complete failure in my owns eyes 
and i came across the book i opened the book and i saw him 
put yourself where i was i saw him on the roof of the gabled 
luxurious dakota apartment and i became hurt enraged at what i 
perceived to be his phoniness 
chapman was lying in wait for lennon outside the dakota a 
famous apartment building in new york city dec 8 1980 when the 
musician and his wife yoko ono were coming home from a latenight 
recording session 
when his limousine pulled up he got out and he looked at me 
im sure he remembered me said chapman who earlier in the day 
got the star to sign a copy of the ne double fantasy album 
i walked back into the driveway and took the combat stance 
just the way id practiced in my hotel room 
chapman recalled standing there with a voice inside his 
head whispering do it do it do it 
as he walked past i aimed right at his back and i pulled the 
trigger five times he said 
chapman said he has come to feel great remorse for killing a man 
he still looks upon as a seeker of truth 
it was an end of innocence for that time and i regret being 
the one that ended it

saddam husseins armies rattled nerves around the persian gulf 
sunday with the first test of surfacetosurface missiles since the 
invasion of kuwait and iraqs president said the chances of war 
are 5050 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii said the 
united states would not attack iraq provided iraqi troops are 
withdrawn from kuwait and foreign hostages are freed 
iraq which has been sporadically releasing captives let more 
go on sunday fifteen freed americans flew out of iraq to amman 
jordan with former world heavyweight champion muhammad ali who 
secured their release in talks with saddam 
a spokesman for the boxer said he planned to return to baghdad 
on christmas eve to try to bring out more of the hundreds of 
remaining captives who were stranded when iraq invaded small 
oilrich kuwait on aug 2 
also in amman jordanian foreign minister marwan kassem told 
kuwaiti leaders that jordan favors the total withdrawal of iraqi 
troops from the emirate according to kuwaiti reports and a senior 
jordanian official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a statement signed by former kuwaiti parliamentarian ahmad 
alrabee said the meeting was a step towards improving 
relations between the two nations 
king hussein has criticized iraqs invasion of kuwait but has 
failed to strongly condemn it like most countries there was also 
speculation some supplies were shipped through jordan to iraq in 
violation of the unbacked trade embargo 
the kuwaiti delegation which includes lawmakers journalists 
and writers was scheduled to meet king hussein and other state 
officials 
iraq meanwhile told the soviet union that it could lose its 
influence in the arab world if it sent troops to the persian gulf 
that was apparently in response to a warning from soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze who said last week moscow would send 
in soldiers if soviet citizens trapped in iraq were harmed 
the official iraqi news agency quoted an iraqi foreign ministry 
spokesman as saying shevardnadze seems to be looking for a 
pretext to send troops to the region 
more than 350000 troops are in the persian gulf as part of the 
usled multinational force american troops now numbering more 
240000 are expected to swell to around 400000 by next month 
the us military refused to say whether the american forces 
went on alert sunday when iraq launched surfacetosurface missiles 
in what appeared to be test launches 
the missiles were fired and landed in iraqi territory us 
military officials in saudi arabia said in a statement 
the officials refused to say how the missiles were detected but 
they apparently were monitored either by us spy satellites or 
awacs airborne earlywarning radar planes which are on patrol 24 
hours a day 
the military statement did not say what kind of missiles were 
involved but defense secretary dick cheney interviewed in 
washington by abctv said they were scud missiles or scud 
variants he said it was the first such firing since april 
cheney said saddam has used the missiles which have a range of 
350 to 400 miles with conventional warheads in the past but he 
said a scud could conceivably carry chemical weapons 
the iraqi testfiring came at a time of already heightened 
tensions the forces in saudi arabia were reported to have been put 
on yellow alert one category below full combat alert last 
week after the un security council approved a resolution 
authorizing use of force against iraq if it does not withdraw from 
kuwait by jan 15 
saddam in an interview broadcast sunday by the french 
television network antenne 2 repeatedly refused to answer 
questions about the possibility of a pullout from kuwait 
in the interview the first granted to a foreign television 
network since the un resolution was passed he was asked what the 
chances were of war breaking out 
fiftyfifty he replied 
but he said he was ready to talk with us officials if they 
came to baghdad in a spirit of dialogue that was in apparent 
reference to an offer by president bush last week to send baker to 
iraq for talks 
iraq accepted but said it wanted to talk about the arabisraeli 
conflict too the united states has refused to link any resolution 
of the gulf crisis with the palestinian question 
baker said sunday that if saddam complied with un resolutions 
passed since the crisis erupted four months ago he would have no 
reason to fear attack 
there has never been any suggestion that force would be used 
if the un resolutions are fully complied with the secretary of 
state said in an interview on nbctv 
those resolutions call for the unconditional withdrawal of iraqi 
troops from kuwait the restoration of the kuwaiti government and 
the release of all hostages 
the 15 americans freed sunday were among 47 foreigners 
including belgians britons and canadians freed separately by iraq 
who arrived in amman aboard an iraqi airways flight 
all the americans had been held at strategic sites in iraq and 
kuwait as human shields against any attack by the multinational 
force 
in other developments 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz met with yasser arafat 
chairman of the palestine liberation organization the iraq news 
agency said only that they discussed developments in the arab 
arena 
eight british women and one dutch woman left london sunday 
bound for baghdad where they hope to win the release of their 
husbands the british government discourages such trips but 
similar missions have met with success 
filipinos returning from iraq and occupied kuwait told of long 
lines for food and of iraqis scavenging for scraps thrown away at 
the airport by departing foreigners some of the filipinos also 
said iraqi soldiers were still looting groceries and homes in 
occupied kuwait
