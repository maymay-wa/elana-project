a fort worth bishop has called for 
recognition of a church within a church as a haven for 
conservative episcopalians opposed to such socalled liberal trends 
as the ordination of women 
let us firmly declare and commit ourselves to the episcopal 
church and to the provinces of the anglican communion that it is 
our will to be the church within the church the rt rev 
clarence pope jr said thursday 
pope bishop of the diocese of fort worth and president of the 
evangelical and catholic mission addressed nearly 1200 delegates 
at the opening session of the episcopal synod of america on 
thursday 
pope is president of the evangelical and catholic mission and 
he and other bishops in the mission called the synod last year 
after the rev barbara harris was consecrated as the first female 
bishop in the episcopal church 
the bishops called ms harris election the final crisis 
pope and other speakers contended that segments of the episcopal 
church are abandoning the biblical faith through decisions to 
ordain female priests and bishops and efforts to relax moral 
teachings on sexuality and marriage 
we must do all we can to remain within this church and do all 
we can to transform this church said the rt rev johndavid 
schofield of the diocese of san joachin fresno calif if it 
will not be permitted then we will have to take the next step when 
it comes 
pope said the episcopal churchs laws do not prevent the 
traditionalists from forming a voluntary association and he called 
for the acceptance of the new organization as a way for 
traditionalists to stay within the church 
we seek nothing more and nothing less than to provide a way to 
maintain and propagate the gospel of jesus christ through the 
unchanged tradition of the historic church society we 
believe is hungry for this kind of church and gospel neither of 
which is subject to the shifting sands of this present age pope 
said 
popes proposal would create a voluntary organization that would 
allow traditionalist bishops and priests to visit parishes 
traditionalist bishops a small minority in the 29 millionmember 
episcopal church say the church has lost 1 million members in the 
past two decades because of liberal changes including the 
ordination of women

the state of california should share the huge 
cost of cleaning up the stringfellow toxic waste site a project 
with a potential price tag of up to 740 million a jury decided 
friday 
the sixmember federal jury did not determine how much the state 
should contribute to the cleanup of the riverside county hazardous 
waste site leaving that decision to us district court judge 
james ideman 
the decision came after less than a day of deliberations 
the stringfellow site opened in 1956 and received an estimated 
34 million gallons of acids pesticides and other toxic materials 
before it was closed in 1972 
the panel ruled the state was liable because it supervised 
construction of the toxic landfill delayed cleanup activities and 
allowed a dangerous condition to exist on public property 
the jurors also found the state liable for maintaining a 
nuisance and breaching its duty to deal with toxic contamination 
but ruled the state was not negligent in choosing or designing the 
site in the early 1950s or for failing to remedy the toxic 
contamination 
the decision pleased lawyers for jb stringfellow jr owner of 
the quarry that contained the dump and 14 users of the landfill who 
were all found liable to share cleanup costs by ideman 
we believe the implications of todays ruling is that the 
state will bear the lions share said attorney michael kahn 
stringfellow 62 of costa mesa said he was delighted with the 
jurys decision i feel better he said its the first time 
anyone had heard my story 
deputy attorney general don robinson said the verdict favored 
the state because it rejected the plaintiffs claims the state was 
negligent in choosing and designing the dumpsite and that it 
allegedly failed to remedy problems that became apparent in the 
1970s 
robinson hinted that an appeal was possible saying that he felt 
the jury would not have found the state liable at all if retired 
judge harry peetris who presided over the factfinding hearing 
had not refused to instruct the jury on several legal defenses 
possibly applicable to the state 
it is the opinion of the attorney generals office that these 
defenses would have barred any finding of liability against the 
state on the portion of the verdict that dealt with those 
theories robinson said 
during the twomonth proceeding deputy attorney general barbara 
noble told the jury operators of the stringfellow site were to 
blame because they allegedly failed to follow design specifications 
in a key area of the dump site 
the alleged error allowed toxic materials to overflow barriers 
and spread into groundwater supplies she said 
stringfellow attorney christopher bisgaard said his client 
initially balked at the idea of putting the toxic dump on his 
property but relented after state officials allegedly promised to 
help build and operate the dump 
bisgaard said state geologists erroneously determined in 1955 
that the quarry was located above an impermeable granite bedrock 
suitable for safe dumping 
barry p goode attorney for rohr industries one of the 
companies that dumped chemicals at the stringfellow site said the 
jury decision shifted blame from companies that merely accepted 
state assurances the site was safe 
we were found liable without having done anything wrong 
goode said

psa the los angeles department of airports and a security company 
contending they were negligent in allowing burke to board the jet 
bound for san francisco with a loaded gun 
the airline airport agency and ogden allied aviation services 
corp contend burke was solely responsible for the fatal crash

he was fired by a man he allegedly shot in the passenger section of 
the plane before he entered the cockpit and fired on the flight 
crew 
julian andrew hayes jr a pilot and former air traffic 
controller testified as an expert witness for the plaintiffs using 
a recording of the cockpit crews conversation with an air traffic

about 350000 in flight insurance from a terminal vending machine 
before boarding the airliner

while some city slickers may think real 
cowboys are an endangered species cowboy poets know better 
sixteen cowboy poets participated in fridays national cowboy 
symposium and celebration reciting verses about bull riding the 
cowboys changing way of life and the barren land they try to tame 
as long as there are cows and people eat hamburgers there 
will be cowboys and my audience will exist said baxter black 
who quit his work as a cattleman and veterinarian in the early 
1980s to become a fulltime cowboy poet 
the poems were melancholy and humorous john underwoods had 
plenty of whimsy one verse was about a dream of a scientifically 
enhanced steer with eyes a big a truck headlights each horn 
weighed a thousand pounds 
cowboy poetry is looking at our flaws and foible and laughing 
at ourselves said black i try to nudge that fine line between 
good taste and throwing up in your hat 
black recites his poems which run as long as 10 minutes from 
memory almost effortlessly however on a recent appearance on the 
johnny carson show he was so nervous he considered using a 
teleprompter 
but i decided no thats not the cowboy way he said

a government watchdog says 16 trillion in 
private pension funds are subject to potential fraud and abuse 
because of loose regulations and lax enforcement of federal pension 
laws 
labor department inspector general j brian hyland said in a 
report to congress on friday that the problems that leave the 
pension system open to abuse are much like those that triggered the 
savings and loan crisis 
unless congress acts quickly to strengthen the laws and require 
the government to improve oversight of pension funds the potential 
exists for a nightmare that would dwarf the sampl crisis hyland 
said in the report 
as unfortunately has been demonstrated by the recent savings 
and loan crisis government regulation of an industry does not 
ensure that invested assets are protected he said 
the report drew immediate criticism however from a research 
group that follows employee benefit programs and from the labor 
department itself which said the pension laws have been 
strengthened in recent years and are under constant review 
i think he is very dramatically overstating any problems 
said dallas l salisbury president of the employee benefit 
research institute he said that as a result of the 1974 law 
governing pensions the funded status of the private pension 
system has improved dramatically in each of the last 15 years 
also a spokeswoman for the federal agency that insures private 
pension funds said hyland appeared to be exaggerating the 
governments and taxpayers potential liability in the event of 
a major pension funding crisis the likelihood of which she said 
was remoter than remote 
but hyland while not alleging any specific abuses said 
existing laws and regulations allow employers and pension fund 
managers to hide abuses from the government he said understaffing 
at the labor department leaves the government little chance to 
catch offenders 
the department hyland said has just 300 people to monitor and 
enforce the nations central pension law and lacks a system to 
detect when reports pension funds are required to file are 
delinquent 
permissive regulations allow fund administrators and their 
accountants to omit from reports information that could alert the 
government to fraud abuse and mismanagement said the inspector 
general 
hyland said his and other reviews of enforcement of the 1974 
employee retirement income security act have found a striking 
number of parallels to the current savings and loan crisis 
particularly in the failure of managers and private accountants to 
pinpoint and report significant management and operations problems 
the labor department attacked that assertion saying the 
analogy between the sampl crisis and erisa is a faulty one on the 
one hand over recent years sampls were largely deregulated while 
pension rules have become more stringent 
but hyland said the 100 billion the congressional budget office 
estimates it will cost american taxpayers to rescue savings and 
loans would appear a bargain should a similar crisis wrack a 
significant number of the nations 870350 private pension funds 
and a sizable portion of their 16 trillion in assets 7000 for 
every man woman and child in the united states 
the burden of insuring and protecting failed benefit plans 
will fall upon all taxpayers not just plan beneficiaries and 
parties since the pension benefit guarantee corp is the final 
insurer of these plan assets hyland said unless steps are 
taken now todays sampl bailout may become tomorrows erisa 
nightmare 
jane hoden a spokeswoman for the pension guaranty corporation 
said the agency believed the protections of erisa while not 
abusefree were strong enough to prevent a crisis in the private 
pension system 
most pension plans are well managed and well funded ms 
hoden said the likelihood of something like that happening is 
remoter than remote 
in the unlikely event of a total or neartotal collapse of the 
private pension system pgbc would be liable for its assets plus 
its line of credit with the federal treasury now 100 million ms 
hoden said 
the agencys assets now total 26 billion and are expected to 
top 10 billion in the next decade she said the government is not 
bound to back the agency beyond the limits of the credit line 
unlike its responsibility to cover all insured bank deposits if the 
government agencies that insure them run short of cash ms hoden 
said

the agriculture department is opening up 
millions of acres of erosionprone land for hay cutting and 
livestock grazing to help farmers in droughtstricken areas 
usda announced the assistance on friday saying producers in 
more than 500 counties in 16 states currently could be eligible 
livestock producers have exhausted stocks of hay that were 
carried into winter and they are now faced with another dry 
spring agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said so theyre 
out of hay and short of grass 
the land being made available is part of a conservation reserve 
program that pays people to take their most erosionprone land out 
of production for at least 10 years and improve it by planting 
grasses and trees 
the haying assistance would be authorized county by county in 
states where a livestock emergency has been declared currently 16 
states mostly in the midwest and great plains according to usda 
tighter restrictions would be placed on livestock grazing on the 
socalled crp acres it would be allowed only after a visual 
inspection of the land by the soil conservation service to ensure 
it would not suffer any damage 
the 16 states are kansas missouri iowa nebraska oklahoma 
texas california colorado florida illinois minnesota new 
mexico new york north dakota south dakota and wisconsin 
county offices of the agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service must seek authority for the haying and grazing 
privileges kelly shipp yeutters press secretary said about 570 
counties in the 16 states were eligible currently to apply for the 
crprelated assistance because they had received livestock 
emergency declarations additional counties and states could become 
eligible later 
as of last year 28 million acres nationwide 19 million of 
those in the 16 states had been enrolled in the conservation 
reserve program which was established by the 1985 farm law as a 
way to reduce erosion and trim overproduction on marginal land the 
government paid 14 billion in yearly rental payments to producers 
participating in the program 
fridays announcement is the latest federal aid made available 
to farmers facing crop and livestock losses from lingering drought 
conditions it followed yeutters visit to iowa earlier this week 
and earlier visits to nebraska and kansas 
usda last month authorized livestock grazing and hay cutting on 
land taken out of production under this years commodity programs 
but put off a decision on conservation reserve acreage in 
addition livestock and poultry producers have been allowed to buy 
surplus governmentowned grain at discount prices 
these restrictions will apply to the crp assistance 
rental payments to producers next year will be cut 50 percent 
for those who cut hay or graze livestock nationwide annual 
payments averaged 48 an acre last year 
no crp land with grasses planted after july 1 1987 will be 
eligible 
only one hay cutting will be allowed and none permitted after 
july 15 at least three inches of stubble must be left and a 
onefourth of each field must be left untouched to provide cover 
for wildlife 
local ascs operations will determine how long grazing will be 
permitted on crp land as well as the number of livestock no 
grazing will be allowed after aug 1

most savings and loan associations will have 
to increase the amount of capital they keep in reserve the 
government says 
the increase is required by current regulations that tie the 
capital standards to the industrys annual profitability 
as a result the federal home loan bank board said friday that 
minimum requirements for most savings and loans will rise from the 
current 344 percent of liabilities to 375 percent at the start of 
next year 
the regulations would gradually increase capital requirements to 
6 percent 
the rules however are likely to be superseded by legislation 
under consideration in congress that would overhaul sampl regulations 
and require thrift operators to put more of their own money at risk 
to stay in business 
the tougher capital requirements proposed by president bush as 
part of his sampl bailout package have been the subject of intense 
debate on capitol hill with differences between house and senate 
proposals likely to be ironed out by a joint conference committee 
under the changes announced friday by the bank board sampls in 
the standard group which includes healthy thrifts and covers 
about 80 percent of the industry would see their capital 
requirements rise to 360 percent on july 1 and to 375 percent 
next january 
capital requirements vary case by case for sampls in the lower 
group made up of thrifts experiencing financial difficulty or 
under federal supervision but their required capital would rise 
by 019 percent on july 1 and another 018 percent next january

senate judiciary committee joseph biden says 
the american bar association may have too much influence in the 
selection of federal judges a position that puts him in partial 
agreement with conservative critics 
in some respects the abas standing committee has become 
larger than life biden said friday at a hearing of his 
committee he was referring to the abas standing committee on 
federal judiciary 
surely the judiciary committee has over the years given the 
aba standing committee an exalted status he said but biden also 
said that the abas opinion on judges was sought in the past 
because cronyism and not competence was all too often the reason 
for choosing a nominee 
biden spoke the same day that attorney general dick thornburgh 
told reporters he considered his dispute with the aba over judicial 
selection to be settled 
thornburgh told reporters he regarded an agreement reached with 
the bar group last month to be dispositive of this issue 
conservative senators have been smoldering ever since four of 
the standing committees 15 members voted to find thenjudge robert 
bork unqualified for a seat on the us supreme court 
joined by a number of other lawmakers conservative senators 
have been calling for an overhaul or even an end to the process 
under which the committee meets behind closed doors and does not 
explain how it arrives at its conclusions or how the individual 
committee members voted 
the system sen gordon humphrey rnh told the judiciary 
committee is a moldering corrupted malodorous old relic which 
should be given a quick burial for the sake of public health 
sen orrin hatch rutah told the judiciary committee it is 
no longer appropriate that this one private organization be granted 
a status not accorded to any other group 
it exercises a virtual veto over judicial nominees hatch 
said 
but sen howard m metzenbaum dohio scoffed at what he called 
conservative concerns over the abas liberal focus he said he had 
been an aba member for decades and theres no question about it 
i would put the aba on the conservative side 
who are you kidding metzenbaum said this is the 
hierarchy of all the big corporate law firms in the country 
under the new agreement with the aba the group promised to drop 
a disputed paragraph from a brochure outlining its methods of 
reviewing potential nominees for the federal bench 
the paragraph to be erased says political or ideological 
philosophy are not considered except to the extent that they may 
bear upon other factors 
far from barring consideration of politics critics say the 
paragraph specifically opens the door to such inquiries 
aba officials also promised to refrain from weighing the 
ideology and political philosophy of potential candidates for judge 
whose names are sent to it for review by the department of justice 
the officials however made a point of adding they had never 
considered those factors in their evaluations 
names of potential federal judges are sent to the president by 
senators and other influential officials before they are nominated 
by the president they are evaluated by the administration and 
investigated by the fbi 
since 1953 the government also has maintained an arrangement 
under which potential candidates are screened by the aba the major 
professional association of the nations lawyers before the 
president sends their names to capitol hill for confirmation by the 
senate

wellesley college commencement to take precautions against crime 
but not to be ruled by fear

to her in 1974 two days before she graduated from wellesley 
on my way home from a rehearsal right here in the parking lot 
of my new boston apartment i was raped she said 
i cannot tell you why black teenagers in new york would abuse

sexually abuse a mentally impaired girl they had gone to school 
with all their lives estrich told the 511 graduates of the 
allwomen college 
and you do not need me to remind you about locking doors and 
traveling in twos and not taking unnecessary risks i can only

the energy department is taking a second look 
at the possibility of a geological fault near the nevada site where 
the nations first permanent dump for highlevel nuclear waste is 
planned 
the department which previously had concluded there was no such 
fault sent a team of scientists to nevada last month to review 
existing data on the question to make sure we didnt overlook 
something department spokeswoman ginger king said friday 
the review was prompted by the nuclear regulatory commission 
which raised questions about the departments decision to dismiss a 
1982 study that reported the possible fault said carl gertz 
manager of the yucca mountain project the name for the planned 
dump 
there doesnt appear to be a fault gertz said in a 
telephone interview but its not possible to know for sure until 
the department begins actual digging work that work cant start 
until nevada grants certain permits he said 
the site borders the nevada test site where underground nuclear 
tests are conducted 
the nrc which must approve a license for the waste repository 
also recommended more extensive study on whether the site contains 
significant amounts of gold gertz said 
any gold mining activity could disrupt the repository but gertz 
said preliminary energy department studies indicated no significant 
amounts of any valuable minerals at the site which is about 100 
miles northwest of las vegas he said additional studies were 
planned but that the nrc wanted even more 
the dump is intended to entomb 70000 tons of highly radioactive 
waste from commercial nuclear reactors and from the energy 
departments nuclear weapons plants numerous sites were under 
consideration early in the decade but in 1987 congress decreed 
that the search would be limited to yucca mountain 
the nevada state government strongly objects to the project and 
has accused the energy department of disregarding the 1982 study 
that said there may be an uncharted fault parallel to the ghost 
dance fault which cuts through the site 
in a letter to gertz on tuesday the nevada nuclear waste 
project office said the 1982 report contains strong evidence of 
a fault intersecting the area where two exploratory shafts would be 
drilled earthquakes could destabilize the holes 
the state contends that if the additional fault were confirmed 
it would disqualify yucca mountain as a waste dump because the 
energy departments site criteria rule out sites with underground 
facilities closer than 100 feet from a fault 
the nrc raised a similar point according to sue gagner a 
commission spokeswoman she said the department was told in a 
meeting in early may that it looks like they may be violating 
their own criteria she said the nrc would publish a lengthy 
analysis of the energy departments preliminary site study in july 
gertz said a team of researchers would spend the next two months 
reviewing all the existing scientific data on the possible 
existence of an uncharted fault but that the key to ending the 
debate was getting started with exploratory drilling 
rather than rehash all their old data we want to get on the 
mountain he said 
king said energy secretary james watkins had begun reviewing the 
project plans and schedules in light of nevadas objections and a 
series of delays in the program that have drawn the ire of the 
congress and the nuclear utility industry she said watkins had not 
yet come to any conclusions about possible changes

the district of columbias nonvoting 
congressional delegate whose office personnel practices are under 
preliminary investigation by the justice department says he has 
done nothing to violate the law or the rules of congress 
in a statement friday to reporters walter fauntroy complained 
about justice department leaks concerning the probe and said he is 
cooperating fully with authorities 
he also said the associated press has consistently filed 
misleading stories over the past six months 
in declaring his innocence fauntroy also said the justice 
department has subpoenaed personnel records that are not in my 
possession nor mine to give 
fauntroy a nonvoting democratic delegate to the house said 
attorney general dick thornburgh simply must get control of his 
agency he urged thornburgh to appoint an independent counsel to 
look into the news leaks that have provided the ap with material 
for some of its stories 
the ap reported last november that thomas savage the son of 
rep gus savage dill was on fauntroys payroll from sept 8 
1987 to june 13 1988 and that for a portion of that time he also 
was campaigning for election to the illinois legislature the ap 
also reported that in his election petition savage said he resided 
in chicago 
in his statement fauntroy said ap had failed to report that 
savage was placed on an unpaid leave of absence for the 10 weeks 
that he was in chicago campaigning for a state office 
aps original story on nov 29 1988 reported that house 
records showed savage had been on an unpaid leave of absence for 
six weeks during that period house records that could resolve the 
discrepancy were unavailable late friday

communist authorities since 1981 
urban was the point man for seven years in the governments 
campaign against the solidarity union movement and he was among

independents the other seats are reserved for members of the 
communist party and its allies 
as government spokesman urban gave his first news conference in 
december 1981 on the day the government imposed martial law and 
suppressed solidarity the independent union movement subsequently 
was outlawed but was legalized again in april following 
negotiations that also set the framework for sundays elections

the former head of a former union 
now he is running for a sejm seat in warsaws centercity

a divided swiss socialist party 
gathered today to discuss an extraordinary proposal disbanding 
this neutral nations 625000member army 
about 1000 delegates were to decide the partys official stand 
in a nov 26 national referendum on dismantling the army the 
proposal for unlateral disarmament is given no chance at the polls 
but the socialists position on it could have an impact on the 
countrys 30yearold coalition government 
the proposal has drawn fierce reactions from the socialists 
three centerright partners in a governing alliance often cited as 
a prime factor in switzerlands political stability 
a leader of the conservative swiss peoples party christoph 
blocher has said an antiarmy decision by the socialist party 
congress should spell the end of the government coalition 
switzerlands army has not fought a foreign war for five 
centuries but western military experts have rated it as one of the 
worlds besttrained and most highly motivated forces 
the socialists right wing and trade union leaders were seeking 
a resolution to keep the army the left wing was inclined toward 
dismantling the army 
party president helmut hubacher predicted that the meeting 
which was to open in bern today would decide not to issue a 
recommendation that too would provoke criticism from the 
centerright 
the antiarmy proposal was authored by socialists and religious 
pacifists they collected 113000 signatures backing a proposed 
amendment to the federal constitution saying switzerland has no 
army and deleting all references to defense needs under the 
system of direct democracy in this nation of 42 million voters 
the signatures were enough to force a nationwide vote 
even supporters admit the proposal has no chance of winning and 
was mainly meant as a prodisarmament demonstration but it has 
posed a predicament for the socialists switzerlands 
secondlargest political party ever since being officially 
submitted three years ago 
in its platform the party endorses switzerlands armed 
neutrality but it has a record of being critical about the defense 
budget and procurement plans 
hubacher 63 a former infantry private urged unsuccessfully a 
clear position against the proposal which he called a rotten 
egg 
it is an illusion to think we should set an example and 
disarm he said in an interview it is not we who are a threat 
to the world but the big powers 
the two socialist members of the sevenmember federal executive 
foreign minister rene felber and finance minister otto stich also 
have spoken against the proposal senior party members warned that 
supporting the proposal would boost conservative groups that split 
from the main party in recent years 
but warnings have not stemmed a surprisingly strong pacifist 
groundswell in the party particularly among the young and in urban 
regions 
at the special congress the partys future defense concept is 
the only point on the agenda 
recent public opinion polls suggest that about one of four 
voters might sympathize with the zero option women appear to 
oppose disbanding the army more than men though feminist groups 
favor the proposal 
polls are not always reliable in multilingual multicultural 
switzerland but even the conservative neue zuercher zeitung 
newspaper in a recent editorial conceded a declining trend in 
popular support of the army 
protests have been growing against lowflying combat planes 
projects to expand army exercise grounds and noise from mandatory 
regular target practice by militia members at the countrys 2500 
shooting ranges 
but most swiss remain opposed to a farewell to arms in the 
country where the military has a long tradition 
i understand every voting citizen who may be tempted to use 
this occasion for venting personal anger at the army or the defense 
department defense minister kaspar villiger was quoted as 
telling the independent basler zeitung newspaper 
but this time we are closely watched from abroad and 
therefore it is particularly important to make plain as firmly as 
possible that we remain committed to armed neutrality and to the 
defense of our country

the man likely to succeed jim wright as 
house speaker believes both parties are tired of partisan 
mudslinging and is pledging to use his ties to democrats and 
republicans to improve the atmosphere in congress 
rep thomas s foley dwash spoke critically friday of the 
ethics war sweeping congress in recent months but foley known as 
a consensus builder also praised the work of the house ethics 
committee which comprises six democrats and six republicans 
the committee has won a broad degree of public respect in the 
manner in which its handled the difficult issues before it 
foley said what we are talking about is the use of ethics issues 
as a tool or instrument of recrimination partisanship 
its not the ethics committee its the members on either side 
who are trying to come up with some concept of abusive charges 
foley the house majority leader said members of both parties 
are guilty of using ethics issues for recrimination and 
partisanship 
i think the vast majority of members on both sides of the 
aisle are tired of that sort of tactic he told reporters at the 
bank of america headquarters following a private luncheon with 
california democrats 
the 60yearold foley said he hopes to restore the publics 
confidence and mutual respect in congress 
we have to reach out on both sides of the aisle to try and 
change the mood of bitterness which exists to some degree and 
hard feelings which exist to some degree in both parties and get 
back to a mood of mutual respect and conciliation which can and 
must be the basis of any effective parliamentary body he said 
first elected to congress in 1964 foley has been described by 
colleagues in both parties as the ideal leader to bring a 
bipartisan spirit back to congress in the wake of resignations by 
wright dtexas and house majority whip tony coelho dcalif 
foley provided no specifics on how he plans to fight resentments 
and abuses in both parties 
but he said he hopes to create a task force to examine issues 
like the code of conduct ethical standards and whether to limit or 
abolish fees representatives receive for speeches and appearances 
coelho recently acknowledged that he failed to report a loan 
from a savings and loan whose chief executive helped set him up in 
a junk bond deal he said last week he is quitting congress rather 
than endure an ethics investigation like the one that felled wright 
wright resigned wednesday following a yearlong 15 million 
investigation by the house ethics committee that led to charges he 
violated house rules in 69 instances

a sailor who survived the uss iowa explosion 
says he heard his friend and crewmate talk of suicide but never of 
blowing up a ship 
nbc news reported earlier friday that investigators of the iowa 
explosion are focusing on clayton hartwig who was one of the 47 
sailors to die in the blast april 19 
nbc said hartwig was often despondent and aloof and that he 
reportedly told a witness if youve got to go go in a blast 
you go quick you go painless 
but hartwigs friend gunners mate 3rd class kendall truitt 
said on abcs nightline that he didnt take hartwigs talk of 
suicide seriously 
the way he described you know killing himself would have 
been just simply to walk off the ship truitt said he never 
talked about an explosion 
truitt said he remembered that hartwig was a little down but 
it was over a year and a half ago he had at one point talked 
about suicide but it wasnt very serious i think we all talk 
about suicide at least once in our life and at the time the 
divisions were razzing him about how close friends we were 
nbc said hartwig 25 was the last man to touch the gunpowder 
that exploded in the ships second turret on april 19 
nbc reported a witness told investigators that hartwig showed 
off a 15 timer available in hobby stores and said that if it were 
rigged to a battery it could set off the ships gunpowder and start 
a chain of explosions 
but truitts attorney ellis rubin said on nightline that 
he believed the explosion may have been caused by an inexperienced 
crew working with gunpowder that he contended was unstable because 
it was stored improperly 
last week navy investigators said the gunpowder had been stored 
at unusually high temperatures at one point but they also said 
that would not have affected its stability 
rubin also said he had talked to an iowa crewman who remembered 
hearing someone say shortly before the blast tell them were not 
ready yet 
navy spokesman lt cmdr chris baumann said he could not comment 
on the network report and expressed regret that leaks about the 
investigation were distressing relatives and ships crew 
hartwig could have inserted a homemade detonator between bags of 
gunpowder in the breech of the turrets center 16inch gun nbc 
said navy explosive experts have successfully tested a similar 
timing device in a simulation the network added 
cbs also reported that a witness told investigators that hartwig 
had shown him a timing device and said words to the effect that he 
could blow the ship up the network said no remnants of a timer 
were found but firefighting may have washed them away 
investigators reportedly said such a device could have given off 
smoke or made a noise that could have served as a warning to other 
sailors it had been known earlier that the last words of sailor 
richard lawrence spoken into a internal ship telephone were 
weve got a problem in here 
a different voice was heard saying something that sounded like 
smoke smoke smoke help help nbc said 
many sailors bodies were found in defensive positions hunched 
over with their arms covering their heads the network said 
in addition nbc said investigators found that hartwig had 
written letters that spoke of his death and the destruction of the 
second turret the network quoted sources as saying they believed 
hartwig lived in a fantasy world and told relatives of an upcoming 
transfer to london that the navy said he had not been given 
nbc said truitt was heard by two other sailors as saying 
immediately after the blast i cant believe he actually did it 
truitt said on nightline that he did not recall making such 
a statement and added he hartwig never talked about blowing up 
a ship or anything 
truitt has asked the navy for an apology for linking his name to 
the criminal investigation of the explosion rubin said friday at a 
news conference if the navy wants to reveal it they will and 
theyre going to hes going to be cleared 
responding to rubins comments baumann said friday night how 
can we clear him we havent accused him of anything 
he read from a navy statement that said the navy recognizes 
with regret the additional anguish press reports from some 
unidentified sources have placed on the families of deceased iowa 
shipmates as well as the crew itself 
we wish to assure these families the navy remains committed to 
a thorough and complete investigation and hopes that a responsible 
public understands the need for discretion until all the factors 
can be amassed and evaluated 
baumann said rubins comments were the gist of why were 
putting this out

a state department official is backtracking 
from his denial that a plan was carried out to link aid to honduras 
with help to the nicaraguan contra rebels and a house subcommittee 
chairman says he will ask more questions about the plan 
michael g kozak assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs testified on april 25 that the plan was 
disapproved at the objection of the state department on the 
grounds that conditionality linkage between us assistance and 
any honduran assistance to the contra resistance was contrary 
to us policy 
the whole proposed linkage that was included in the plan was 
disapproved was not made there was no discreet emissary 
kozak told the house appropriations subcommittee on foreign 
operations chaired by rep david obey dwis 
but in a letter to obey this week kozak said i certainly did 
not intend to imply by these statements however that decisions to 
provide assistance to honduras on an expedited basis were not 
thereafter made or carried out 
kozak had testified that an admission of facts agreed to by both 
sides and used in former national security council aide oliver 
norths trial was misleading among other trial documents was a 
feb 1985 memo initialed by president reagan and approving a plan 
to link more than 110 million in extra aid to honduras support 
for the contra rebels 
thenvice president bush traveled to honduras and met with 
president roberto suazo cordova but bush has said he did not 
discuss any possible quid pro quo with suazo 
after examining the secret documents used to draw up the 
admission of facts obey wrote kozak that his testimony did not 
seem to jibe with the documents 
obey said friday that kozak wrote back to say because i am 
responding from the perspective of the department and my own 
personal knowledge i cannot speak to documents from other agencies 
or the thoughts and actions of persons other than myself 
a separate letter to obey from assistant secretary janet mullins 
said information about nondepartmental personnel and activities 
should be sought from other appropriate sources which she did 
not specify 
obey said kozaks letter to him seemed to indicate that his 
original testimony left the wrong impression 
his letter without specifically reversing that simply said 
im sorry if we left the impression that the plan was not carried 
out obey said 
obey said he believed theres absolutely no question that it 
was carried out the documents laid out the plan the additional 
assistance we know did arrive 
kozaks letter will lead to more questions that will be 
addressed both to the state department and the white house 
including questions about aid to other central american countries 
obey said 
last month obey threatened to hold up 700 million in aid for 
latin america unless administration officials concede they misled 
lawmakers about us efforts to win thirdcountry help for the 
nicaraguan rebels 
kozak did not return a message left at his home phone friday 
night

chinese riot police fired tear gas saturday on 
crowds near tiananmen square in a renewed attack against 
prodemocracy students occupying the central square witnesses also 
reported at least 30 people were beaten by police outside the 
beijing hotel 
about 700 to 800 riot police used tear gas to clear an area 
around the entrance to the communist party headquarters at 
zhongnanhai just west of the square they also attacked students 
and others with truncheons 
about 5000 troops meanwhile confronted and were quickly 
surrounded by crowds outside the great hall of the people who were 
defying martial law restrictions imposed last month by premier li 
peng 
the troop advance came hours after larger contingents of 
soldiers were driven back by throngs of people who implored the 
soldiers not to crush the studentled movement for democractic 
reform that began in midapril 
on the west side of the great hall opposite from the square 
crowds quickly grew into the thousands and blocked the troops from 
advancing onto changan avenue the main street running past the 
square 
a city bus was moved in front of the troops to impede their 
advance large crowds stood on top of the bus and inside it 
about a halfmile to the west near zhongnanhai students and 
others were throwing rocks at riot police who were armed with 
truncheons and knives 
one man his chest bloodied said he had been beaten by police 
chinese witnesses said riot police also battled crowds shortly 
after noon outside the beijing hotel to the east of the square 
they said about 30 people have been beaten by police carrying 
truncheons before the police had left the area and headed toward 
the north away from the square 
meanwhile an official report said three people were killed when 
struck by a police car in an accident friday night students linked 
the deaths to their demonstrations and called for a general strike 
in protest 
troops on saturday moved against students whose defiance of 
martial law and occupation of beijings vast square for weeks have 
spurred a power struggle among chinas rulers 
the military advances began about midnight and ended in 
disarray more than eight hours later soldiers still straggled 
away from the city center to the outskirts where about 200000 
soldiers were reportedly camped 
soldiers advanced down changan avenue the capitals main road 
but thousands of students and residents used trucks buses and 
their bodies to stop them in front of the beijing hotel several 
hundred yards east of the square 
other troop convoys coming from other directions also were 
halted 
the middle of the square remained calm with the ode to joy 
from beethovens ninth symphony blaring over student loudspeakers 
more than 2000 people surrounded two unmarked buses one 
carrying about 40 soldiers and the other supplies including 
automatic rifles 12 miles west of tiananmen 
some of the people broke into the supply vehicle and removed 
several automatic rifles one equipped with a bayonet and 
displayed the weapons on a table set up on top of the bus 
a banner draped on the bus read these are the angels of peace 
sent by li peng government to protect the people of the capital 
the crowd alternately cheered and jeered the soldiers as they 
moved away from the square shouts of what do you think youre 
doing and are you of the people filled the balmy night 
said one soldier if im going to die i want to die on the 
battlefield not on changan avenue 
earlier about 3000 student bicyclists headed from the square 
to protest an incident in which a police vehicle ran into a crowd 
the bicyclists turned back when they heard that advancing troops 
were seen on the other side of the square 
governmentrun beijing radio reported saturday that three people 
were killed in the accident the official beijing daily newspaper 
said saturday that two people were killed and two were seriously 
injured 
the newspaper said the police car was traveling too fast on wet 
pavement but gave no other details witnesses said the accident 
occurred at about 11 pm friday 
they were not the first deaths linked to the demonstrations it 
was reported about two weeks ago that a soldier was killed in a 
traffic accident involving troop movements connected to the 
protests 
the beijing independent student union in an announcement on the 
square called for a general strike and a demonstration later 
saturday to protest the deaths

china in 1983 and three others began a hunger strike atop the 
martyrs monument in support of the students 6week campaign for 
democratic reforms 
li declared martial law on may 20 to quell the burgeoning 
studentled protest movement but the declaration only triggered 
greater support for the students 
the number of student protests inside the square had declined 
dramatically in the past week with about 10000 maintaining a 
roundtheclock vigil but friday evening huge masses again 
converged on the plaza the symbolic heart of china 
the students who have gained considerable support from ordinary 
citizens are demanding more democracy an end to official 
corruption 
communist party chief zhao ziyang a reformer who advocated 
concessions to the students has reportedly lost his post and is 
under house arrest

in 1980 five ardent us environmentalists 
went on a hiking and camping trip into the pinacate mountains of 
sonora mexico 
when they returned they had founded a radical activist movement 
earth first epitomized by a noholdsbarred slogan no 
compromise in the defense of mother earth 
with a clenched fist as its logo earth first mounted 
letterwriting efforts staged protests filed suits made threats 
and used theatrical and guerrilla tactics in a variety of battles 
against developers and the lumber and oil industries 
the group has no formal structure no official leaders no 
officeholders no dues no bureaucracy just committed supporters 
it has about 50 chapters worldwide including the korago tribe 
in the solomon islands of the southwest pacific where tribesmen 
burned a logging camp to the ground several years ago 
members adhere to the uncompromising philosophy espoused by the 
most highly profiled of its founders david foreman of tucson who 
was arraigned friday before a federal magistrate and charged with 
conspiracy to sabotage nuclear facilities in arizona california 
and colorado he was freed on a 50000 bond 
three other earth first activists mark leslie davis 39 marc 
baker 37 and margaret millett 35 were ordered held without 
bail foreman is charged with conspiracy the other three face a 
count each of conspiracy and three types of property destruction 
baker davis and millett were committed to attacks on the palo 
verde and diablo canyon nuclear complexes of wintersburg ariz 
and san luis obispo calif respectively and the rocky flats 
nuclear weapons center near denver according to fbi testimony 
based on taperecorded conversations 
assistant us attorney roger dokken told the federal magistrate 
that foreman was the ringleader 
mr foreman is the worst of the group dokken said he 
sneaks around in the background he was the financier the leader 
sort of the guru to get all of this going i dont like to use the 
analogy of a mafia boss but they never do anything either they 
just send their munchkins out to do it 
if convicted foreman faces five years in prison and a 10000 
fine the others each could be sentenced to 35 years and fined 
80000 the fbi said 
earth first adheres to a concept called deep ecology which 
maintains wilderness endangered species and wild plants and 
creatures should be preserved for their own sake 
in a december interview foreman said the groups job is to 
challenge people to live up to higher standards 
i think we redefined the debate he told the arizona daily 
star the media had stopped covering the environment because it 
was boring we made it interesting again 
demonstrations led by earth first included one at the grand 
canyon where members performed a skit in antiradiation suits to 
protest against a proposed uranium mine 
members dressed as birds squirrels and coyotes dropped dollar 
bills on federal park service officials heads during a phoenix 
hearing on flights over grand canyon 
they also staged a diein at the phelps dodge corps now 
closed smelter in douglas where members wearing gas masks climbed 
the smokestacks in opposition to the air pollution it caused 
there have been confrontations such as where foreman put his 
chest against the front of a moving pickup truck in trying to block 
construction of a logging road in oregons siskiyou national forest 
foreman published a book in 1985 titled ecodefense a field 
guide to monkeywrenching which reportedly has sold more than 
11000 copies it is an illustrated and detailed primer on how to 
battle timber and landdeveloping interests 
his book offers instructions on such actions as putting spikes 
into trees to discourage loggers with chain saws knocking 
bulldozers and helicopters out of order by putting sand in engine 
oil pulling up survey stakes and trap lines downing billboards 
cutting fences closing wildernessarea roads and toppling 
powerline towers 
its genesis and that of earth first was a 1975 novel by the 
late edward abbey the monkey wrench gang about a group of 
ecoraiders who unsuccessfully plot to blow up the glen canyon 
dam that blocked the colorado river and created lake powell

barbara ricks finds it altogether fitting 
to be shipping millions of books each year from mississippi the 
state with the highest illiteracy rate to countries where books 
are a scarce commodity 
starting with a single shipment to liberia in 1983 ricks has 
sent more than 2 million books to countries in africa asia and 
latin america 
her nonprofit company books for the world which has won state 
department praise operates from yazoo city a small town 40 miles 
northwest of jackson in the impoverished delta area where she grew 
up 
mississippi seems an unlikely place for the exportation of 
books ricks said echoing comments she has heard time and again 
from book publishers whom she approaches for donations and from 
foreign embassies she contacts to determine which books are needed 
the statement doesnt bother her 
it makes me feel special if i can dismantle stereotypes 
again said ricks a black woman 
ricks who obtained her doctorate in music at michigan state 
university had completed a twoyear education program at harvard 
in 1983 when she was approached by owen cooper the late founder of 
books for the world 
cooper the president of mississippi chemical corp and vice 
president of the baptist world alliance tapped ricks to take over 
the agency 
former president carter has become the agencys honorary board 
chairman 
an estimated 27 percent of adult mississippians are functionally 
illiterate the highest rate in the nation and its school dropout 
rate is also among the highest but in many third world countries 
even the literate often cant read 
if there are people in mississippi or california who dont 
have books its not because books arent available its a social 
problem ricks said at monrovia college in liberia where she 
visited in 1983 ricks met students who had been to college but 
had never had books they could take home and read sometimes a 
single textbook must serve a classroom full of students 
the state department leery of publishers who dump books in the 
third world to turn print overruns into tax deductions has helped 
ricks work in africa 
we felt there was a great need in africa and the initial 
shipments were very popular said allison rosenberg deputy 
assistant secretary of state for african affairs 
books for the world asks foreign educators what kinds of books 
they need then sends a sample copy of every title before shipping 
tons of books that arent wanted rosenberg said 
ricks will take a twoweek tour of 18 african countries 
beginning june 15 and the us embassies in those countries have 
helped her make appointments with potential recipients 
ricks said her office operates on a shoestring textbook 
publishers are approached for donations corporations moving large 
shipments of merchandise are asked to slip in a load of books 
charitable groups such as the ymca and world vision that operate in 
the targeted countries help in distribution 
her office includes another fulltime staffer and volunteers 
from a prison workrelease program 
linda helms education coordinator for the carter center at 
emory university in atlanta said carter visited uganda last summer 
and wanted to find out how the center could ease the severe book 
shortage there 
we made many many phone calls to people to try to find out 
how to do this find out about the problems we might encounter 
helms said we found out books for the world has already put this 
into motion and has done very well with it

a communist party struggling to keep 
itself and polands economy afloat is competing against an 
invigorated solidarity slate of candidates in an election seen as 
the freest in eastern europe in four decades 
the elections sunday for seats in the current onehouse 
parliament and a new senate are also viewed as a huge gamble for 
both sides 
about 80 percent of polands 27 million eligible voters are 
expected to vote 
campaigning ended friday with solidarity leader lech walesa 
taping a television message and gen wojciech jaruzelski the 
polish leader delivering a rare television address 
walesa urged restraint on both sides and said many people in the 
government were worried about the elections outcome 
we are running very aggressively and proposing clear 
solutions he said a lot of people with other political 
concepts have not seen such a thing before and they are scared 
he said solidarity and the communist party face hard work in 
finding solutions to polands economic and social problems 
we are all learning on both sides walesa said we 
shouldnt give way to emotions because emotion could destroy 
us 
jaruzelski made a similar appeal 
this is first of all a dispute about poland about what she 
will be like tomorrow a year from now he said 
an intention to revile those representing different or 
independent views a push for a crushing victory this is not a 
good road playing with fire is not allowed choosing the road of 
hostility tension and upheavals would be deadly to poland 
in apparent acknowledgment that solidarity would win a great 
many seats he called for a broad postelection coalition 
party candidates and their allies are guaranteed 299 seats in 
the sejm or 65 percent solidarity candidates are contesting the 
other 161 seats and all 100 places in the senate which will be the 
first freely chosen legislative chamber in the communist world 
for the communist party the results could reveal an 
embarrassing lack of popular support as it begins a fouryear 
transition leading to democratic elections for the entire 
parliament 
solidarity could be hurt by apathy particularly among the 
young and may lose support when it enters the parliament and 
assumes at least some responsibility for the painful economic steps 
ahead 
whatever the risks solidarity spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz 
said friday it is a breakthrough because these elections are an 
institutionalization of the opposition and the opposition as a 
political force 
walesa who entered negotiations with authorities in february 
hoping to regain solidaritys legal status emerged two months 
later with the large step toward democracy in poland he is not a 
candidate but he is directing the opposition campaign 
jaruzelski also is not running but the government majority in 
the sejm is expected to elect him to the new office of president 
during the campaign candidates devoted little attention to the 
grim economic problems which include probable sharp rises in food 
prices to encourage farmers to produce in an environment of 80 
percent inflation polands high foreign debt also is problematic 
39 billion 
josef czyrek no 2 in the politburo was asked in an interview 
friday how much the party has changed with free elections his 
reply 180 degrees 
czyrek conceded solidarity had a better chance at a senate 
majority and expressed concern about wellknown party figures 
running for uncontested seats in the sejm they will lose if they 
get less than 50 percent approval 
especially unnerving to the party is the possibility that voters 
may reject en masse the 35 prominent communist or allied 
politicians on the unopposed national list for the sejm 
it would be humiliating if people such as czyrek premier 
mieczyslaw f rakowski or interior minister czeslaw kiszczak lost 
although they would not be forced to leave office 
much of the lastminute party propaganda on state television has 
emphasized the national list includes those who agreed to the 
talks that legalized solidarity and brought about the elections

in virginia where tobacco is king and the 
crops green leaves cover the landscape in the summer a law to 
restrict public smoking is almost unthinkable 
but supporters of a statewide limit on lighting up cigarettes 
cigars and pipes in stores offices and other public places plan to 
meet with representatives of the tobacco industry next month in an 
unprecedented effort to reach a compromise over the failed clean 
indoor air bill of 1989 
we did agree that there would be no smoking at the meeting 
said anne donley executive director of virginia gasp group to 
alleviate smoking in public i think its certainly historic that 
the tobacco industry is sitting down and talking with health groups 
about this 
paige sutherland the tobacco institutes regional director 
said were willing to consider some type of restriction on 
public smoking at the statewide level in lieu of any additional 
ordinances at the local level 
the industry that supports virginias leading agricultural crop 
mounted a massive offensive at the general assembly session earlier 
this year to defeat a proposal to limit public smoking 
the bill proposed by sen thomas j michie jr and delegate 
bernard s cohen would have banned smoking in elevators and 
hospital emergency rooms and required nosmoking areas in large 
grocery stores and government buildings 
but lawmakers pressed by a 100000plus lobbying campaign by 
tobacco backers turned down the plan and instead passed a oneyear 
moratorium effective july 1 on local nosmoking ordinances that 
apply to private industry 
according to sutherland antitobacco advocates are hounding 
local government bodies to adopt something before the july 1 cutoff 
on tuesday the newport news city council approved an ordinance 
that limits smoking in stores theaters restaurants and other 
public places portsmouth city council is considering passing such 
an ordinance before july 1 
about a dozen localities already have such regulations 
ms donley said she believes the tobacco industry would like to 
see the moratorium extended indefinitely but she said business 
groups such as retailers hotel and restaurant operators are 
keeping an open mind 
sutherland said complaints that tobacco companies have been 
unyielding in opposition to smoking restrictions are unfair 
were always portrayed as the bad guy he said thats 
simply not true 
were reasonable business people our product is legal and it 
makes a substantial contribution to the economy he said were 
willing to meet with them and get down to trying to hammer out an 
accord 
the meeting tentatively has been set for june 20 in the downtown 
richmond office of anthony f troy a lawyer and former state 
attorney general who is a lobbyist for the tobacco institute 
sutherland said an industryprepared draft of proposed 
legislation would be given to michie and cohen at the meeting

the voluntary decision by alars 
manufacturer to take the chemical off the us market drew praise 
from the nations apple belt as the best way to win back consumers 
uniroyal chemical co continued to defend the chemical as safe 
but said friday that continued use on apples raised public doubts 
about the safety of americas food supply the chemical has been 
labeled a possible carcinogen although tests are continuing 
we should be hopeful and expect this will be the beginning of 
restoring consumer confidence said john mcalister a spokesman 
for selahbased tree top inc the nations largest apple juice 
maker 
but other industry figures said the action is unlikely to help 
the current crop which has turned into a financial disaster 
prices have fallen 40 percent to below the cost of production 
and washington state has 33 million more boxes of apples in 
storage than at this time last year that includes an unknown 
quantity of alartreated apples that may have to be dumped 
it wont make any difference for this year but it certainly 
should help us as far as sales for next years crop said bill 
dewitt of the wenatchee valley traffic association which charts 
apple sales 
washington state produces about half the nations apples and has 
about 12 million of the 42pound boxes in storage 
apple growers and processors nationwide had pleaded with 
uniroyal to withdraw alar public fears had cost each group an 
estimated 100 million in sales so far this year industry groups 
estimate 
the voluntary withdrawal by uniroyal which is based in 
middlebury conn means consumers will be guaranteed that this 
falls apple crop will be alarfree said tom hale of the 
washington state apple commission 
sales of daminozide which is sold under the name alar would 
continue to about 70 foreign markets including some that export 
apples and apple products to this country uniroyal said 
supplies of the chemical held by us customers may be returned 
for refunds the company said 
the environmental protection agency said late friday it has 
reached agreement with uniroyal on a plan to monitor the removal of 
alar from the us market although it is still legal to use the 
agency also said it will notify foreign governments about agency 
concerns about alar 
the epa has said it plans to ban use of daminozide in food 
products because tests in laboratory animals have linked a 
byproduct of alar with cancer after the chemical is heated final 
action on the proposed regulation is not expected until late 1990 
uniroyal has disputed the findings and company vice president 
james wylie said friday we want to emphasize that we have not 
changed our opinion about the safety of daminozide 
the epa estimates that from 5 percent to 15 percent of the us 
apple crop is treated with alar a growth regulator that improves 
the apples appearance and gives it a longer shelf life 
the alar issue was ignited by the private natural resources 
defense councils report that concluded that eating alartreated 
apples increased cancer risk especially in children 
the findings have been disputed by the apple industry and 
several federal agencies including epa declared apples safe to 
eat

with much fanfare authorities sunday are opening 
a sevenmile stretch of interstate 90 that has the dubious 
distinction of being the most expensive segment of freeway ever 
built 
it is part of a 146 billion highway project for the 
mushrooming seattle metropolis to build roads that probably will be 
badly congested by the time they are completed in 1994 
for the time being the new link between seattle and bellevue 
across lake washington brings welcome relief from the twicedaily 
creep across the lakes two existing fourlane spans that become 
jammed by fenderbenders 
commuters also say goodbye to an infamous i90 lane that 
switched direction depending on the commute with no barrier to 
separate traffic motorists tagged it the death lane 
the completed segment includes a floating bridge a 
tripledecker tunnel with one level for bicycles and pedestrians 
and a concreteslab roof over sections of the highway that will be 
landscaped as parks 
the freeway proposed in 1957 drew the wrath of residents who 
wanted to protect neighborhoods and of environmentalists 
in 1971 planners agreed to scale back the project and build 
tunnels on the seattle side of the lake but an environmental 
impact statement wasnt approved until 1979 
by then federal money had dried up and it wasnt until 
congress raised the gas tax in 1982 that funds became available 
construction began in earnest the next year 
so far 860 million has been spent the balance of the money 
will go to reopening and linking up one of the old bridges located 
to the south of the new structure as well as other additions 
at about 200 million a mile the freeway has set a record for 
costliness but one that will soon fall to a project at i90s 
other terminus boston according to seattle project manager brian 
henkel 
that 44 billion project will rebuild interstate 93 through 
downtown boston and construct a third harbor tunnel to link i90 
with logan international airport 
despite a major crisis every second day henkel said he is 
on time and 16 million under budget the project includes the 
worlds largest softground tunnel 1500 feet long and 63 feet in 
diameter henkel said 
henkel said he still sees vestiges of the rancor that surrounded 
the project 
but now its almost opposite to the earlier emotion of make 
the freeway as difficult as possible to get on and maybe they wont 
build it he said now they say i live in seattle and work 
on the eastside and theres no way i can get on i90 conveniently 
king county east of lake washington has grown in the past two 
decades from small towns and farms to a suburban area of 360000 
people another 275000 are expected by 2020 said mike smith 
senior transportation planner for the puget sound council of 
governments 
the county which includes seattle has a population of about 
14 million studies have shown the population of king and 
surrounding counties will grow by about 500000 in the next decade

36 other schoolchildren officials said 
fortyone people including four adults and 37 schoolchildren 
from whittier elementary school in boulder were aboard the bus

mountain canyon road 
skid marks left along the canyon road by the bus indicate that 
it slid out of control for at least 1000 feet before it went over

the student yearbook at a catholic high school 
was recalled after officials discovered the books contained sexual 
innuendo and insults directed at faculty members 
seniors at st ignatius high school were told unless they 
returned their yearbooks they could not go to graduation 
ceremonies sunday while underclassmen were told they could not 
advance to the next grade if they failed to return the books the 
rev robert welsh school president said friday 
thirtyeight of the 800 books printed remained unaccounted for 
friday night welsh said 
there were unacceptable captions and unacceptable stories 
welsh said there were sexual references and there was also bad 
taste and rather insulting remarks to the faculty 
welsh said six of eight seniors who worked on the yearbooks 
apologized to faculty and staff friday afternoon some parents 
accompanied the students he said 
i would say the faculty accepted the apology as a catholic 
school we feel we are called to forgive those who ask for 
forgiveness welsh said 
he said no disciplinary action would be taken against the six 
students 
the plain dealer reported today the captions were apparently 
written after the yearbooks adviser had been injured in a car 
accident 
the yearbook staffers later showed the adviser phony page 
proofs which the teacher approved then the students sent the real 
pages to the publisher the newspaper said 
there are 277 seniors among the 1200 male students at st

baileys the venerable chain of ice cream parlors 
where the hot fudge sundae was invented is trying to make a 
comeback under new ownership after a disastrous experiment in 
yuppie marketing 
last year five of its seven stores closed including the 
landmark location in cambridges harvard square where the mahogany 
paneling and marble table tops were ripped out for a pizzeria 
the 116yearold chains former owner joey crugnale admits he 
goofed in trying to remake baileys as an upscale spot for people 
in their 20s and 30s 
it was a mistake from the beginning he said but im not 
ashamed of it i learned a lot from it 
michael mazzaferro one of three brothers who bought the 
business in november for an undisclosed price said he hopes to 
reopen stores in boston and cambridge within the next few years 
i think the company lost its focus and it became more of a 
luncheon stop as opposed to an oldfashioned candy store and ice 
cream parlor he said we want to restore it to its roots 
the mazzaferro family which has been making candy in 
massachusetts since the 1950s already is turning out baileys 
fudge at the rate of 20000 pounds a year 
that would gladden the heart of sarah dow the bookkeeper to 
founder john bailey when he retired in 1900 she became the shops 
owner and took a gamble that made dessert history 
she put 6 ounces of ice cream in a 5ounce dish and poured one 
and a half ounces of hot fudge on top of it and it dripped down 
onto the silver dish frank wyman jr a former baileys owner 
said with reverence beautiful concept beautiful product 
later baileys supplied mailorder chocolates to theodore 
roosevelt calvin coolidge and john f kennedy joseph kennedy sr 
the late presidents father was among the many boston brahmins who 
kept his candy preferences on record at the flagship store on 
temple place at the edge of the boston common 
shortly after crugnale bought the chain in january 1987 for a 
reported 15 million he announced plans to open more than 100 
stores throughout new england in seven or eight years 
but one of his first moves was to decide there was just no 
future in the oldfashioned menu of sandwiches like chopped ham 
and pickles peanut butter and bacon and datenut bread and cream 
cheese 
although little old ladies who had been faithful customers 
for decades implored him to reconsider crugnale said he held firm 
the entrepreneur 37 had made a fortune with a yuppie trendy 
gourmet ice cream chain called steves and a yuppie trendy 
gourmet pizza chain called bertuccis 
so he ignored the old ladies and pulled the same trick with 
baileys 
it didnt work 
when crugnale sold the chain to the mazzaferros last fall it 
was down to two stores both in the suburbs 
crugnale who had built steves ice cream from one store to a 
national chain of 26 before selling out in 1983 says he was 
probably overconfident when he took over baileys 
i thought i was superman i did steves i could do 
anything he said 
though humbled by his failure with baileys crugnale has made a 
roaring success of bertuccis now a chain of 12 pizzerias in 
massachusetts and rhode island 
baileys was a business we shouldnt have been in he said 
bertuccis is one im much more comfortable with

bankruptcy 
eastern said friday it will eliminate vacations for the rest of 
the year cut management pay by 20 percent and require nonunion 
employees to work 50 hours a week for 40 hours of pay 
meanwhile a judge in new york gave an investor group friendly 
with striking employees until monday afternoon to refine a buyout 
proposal the group is led by chicago commodities trader joseph 
ritchie 
us bankruptcy judge burton r liflands decree surprised 
observers who thought he would dismiss the ritchie proposal as 
financially inadequate and vague 
but david i shapiro the courtappointed examiner for eastern 
told lifland he was impressed by a new version of the plan under 
which the unions would risk 175 million to 200 million of their 
wages over six months 
eastern sought protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws 
five days after pilots and flight attendants joined striking

one of the arab worlds bitterest rivalries 
seems headed toward resolution following a bearhug in morocco 
the hugger was libyan leader moammar gadhafi who a few days 
earlier had threatened to boycott the arab league summit meeting at 
casablanca if egypts hosni mubarak showed up mubarak was the one 
hugged 
that was may 23 
since then invective has halted from both sides of the 
egyptianlibyan border now open for the first time in more than a 
decade 
unannounced egypt canceled military exercises scheduled this 
week in the desert between cairo and libya and is expected to 
reduce forces concentrated there since the early 1970s 
further a libyan aircraft has landed at cairo international 
airport for the first time in years with a promise of regular 
commercial service starting monday 
and col gadhafis cousin and intelligence chief ahmed gaddaf 
dam spent two days in cairo including a meeting wednesday night 
with the egyptian president 
if the drama plays out libya the united statess most strident 
arab enemy soon could restore relations with egypt one of 
washingtons best friends in the region 
on wednesday mubarak told journalists that relations between 
the two countries are on the threshold of a new era based on a 
right foundation of frankness 
several newspapers reported gadhafi would visit egypt some 
saying he would drive to alexandria 300 miles east of the border 
it would be just like him said a foreign ministry source on 
condition of anonymity but we shouldnt jump to conclusions we 
should take it easy and not forget that gadhafi can just as 
suddenly change his mind 
makram mohamed ahmed a magazine editor and mubarak confidant 
wrote that it is realistic to expect the reopening of borders and 
airports but difficult for varying reasons to talk about plans 
for the far future 
the first major strains in relations occurred in 1972 when 
gadhafi proposed a merger of the two north african neighbors that 
was rejected by mubaraks predecessor anwar sadat the break 
occurred in 1977 with a brief border war after sadat accused 
gadhafi of sponsoring terror bombings in egypt 
mubaraks government has charged gadhafi with several attempts 
to assassinate libyan dissidents in egypt several of whom 
coordinate antigadhafi campaigns from their egyptian exile it 
also suspected but was unable to prove that libya laid mines in the 
red sea in 1984 
libya still has no embassy or diplomatic interests section in 
cairo and libyan dissidents while not knowing what to expect 
still receive police protection 
gadhafi has asked mubarak to send home the exiles many of them 
thriving businessmen 
egypt has refused 
libyan exiles had transmitted messages of defiance to their 
countrymen back home on radio cairos voice of the arabs a source 
at the official radio service said however that the station 
stopped its antigadhafi rhetoric shortly before the casablanca 
summit 
in libya the official news agency jana also has changed its 
tone 
on thursday it distributed a report of a telegram to gadhafi 
from a prominent sudanese politician congratulating yourself and 
the arab nation for normalizing brotherly relations with egypt 
and since the summit meeting jana has called the egyptian 
president mubarak instead of its usual term albarek an 
insulting term describing a kneeling camel

the prosecutions star witness in the 
cotton club murder case testified that two bodyguards bragged 
about killing producer roy radin 
the surprise testimony friday prompted the judge to halt a 
preliminary hearing under way to determine if enough evidence 
exists for trial 
william rider said two defendants bragged to him about the radin 
murder and one of them said he enjoyed shooting the big fat jew 
angry defense lawyers interrupted riders testimony objecting 
that they had not been told about at least 10 statements he had 
made in less than an hour on the stand friday 
the lawyers accused prosecutors of hiding incriminating 
information which is prohibited under california laws deputy 
district attorney david conn insisted he had disclosed the gist 
of the statements but municipal court judge patti jo mckay said 
that was insufficient 
she stopped the hearing and ordered prosecution investigators to 
appear in court monday to disclose everything they know about 
riders planned testimony if more material is uncovered she said 
she would grant the defense a continuance 
rider hustler magazine publisher larry flynts brotherinlaw 
and former chief of security implicated two of flynts former 
bodyguards william molony mentzer and alex lamota marti who are 
charged in the may 1983 radin murder 
riders claim that the two confessed to him triggered charges in 
the sixyearold murder in october he also implicated reputed drug 
dealer karen delayne greenberger and former paramount pictures 
chief robert evans who has refused to testify citing fears he 
might incriminate himself evans is not charged 
mrs greenberger who is charged in the murder introduced radin 
and evans in a deal to finance the movie the cotton club 
riders new statements from the witness stand were more detailed 
than those he had given before he said marti and mentzer boasted 
to him in may or june 1983 about the radin murder 
it was sometime before the body was found and after the 
killing he said recalling a conversation with mentzer at 
flynts house 
what did mr mentzer say asked conn 
only that he had just done a hit and dumped the body up by 
where we went target practicing said rider 
radin disappeared on may 13 1983 his body was found a month 
later in a dry riverbed about 65 miles north of los angeles he had 
been shot repeatedly in the head 
in june rider said mentzer and marti brought him a newspaper 
article about the discovery of radins body and said it proved they 
were telling the truth he said they referred to radin by the 
nickname rodan and offered more details 
mr marti said that in reference to mr mentzer getting the 
courage to shoot mr radin that he had to drink a bottle of wine 
before mr marti shot first and emptied his gun into mr radin and 
mr mentzer followed suit said rider 
what else did mr marti say asked deputy district attorney 
david conn 
just that he hated jews and he enjoyed shooting the big fat 
jew said rider 
rider who is being paid 3000 a month as a protected 
prosecution witness has said he fears he will be killed because of 
his testimony 
also charged is robert ulmer lowe who is fighting extradition

authorities say the corrupting power of drugs 
and a belief in witchcraft led to the downfall of a federal agent 
involved with a cult of ritual killers 
salvador vidal garcia alarcon 39 was indicted friday on drug 
trafficking charges the nineyear veteran of the federal judicial 
police pleaded innocent in 7th federal criminal court if 
convicted he faces a term of of seven to 25 years in prison 
in a lengthy statement given earlier to police vidal garcia 
said his contact with the sect was limited to religious matters he 
explained he had been possessed by spirits all his life and sought 
relief from their disrupting powers from the godfather of the cult 
adolfo de jesus constanzo 
vidal garcia described the spirits as useful in helping the 
victims of black magic but said they were also potent and 
troublesome he said he could only get relief from someone with 
magical powers greater than his own 
he said constanzo would perform spiritual cleansings 
involving animal sacrifice 
constanzo had a lucrative practice as a clairvoyant and 
cleanser in mexico city cleansing is designed to remove a 
hex or evil spell and is widely practiced in mexico 
vidal garcia also said he attended black masses and cult 
initiations 
deputy federal attorney general javier coello trejo said vidal 
garcia a member of the federal drug task force had been an 
excellent officer who was wounded several times in the line of 
duty 
his belief in witchcraft and the corrupting influence of drug 
money brought about his downfall coello said 
we dont believe he was responsible for any of the 
homicides coello said 
one cult member told authorities vidal garcia knew that 
constanzo followers had murdered and dismembered a transvestite in 
mexico city in 1988 
another sara aldrete villareal the sects alleged high 
priestess said constanzo told her he killed two men as a favor to 
vidal garcia their bodies were among the 15 discovered in 
matamoros in april 
vidal garcia has been held in the eastern penitentiary in mexico 
city since he was arrested earlier this week 
he was not charged in connection with the murders in matamoros 
or mexico city or with other crimes alleged against the sect 
authorities would not say if he will remain on the police force 
until his case is resolved 
the indictment accuses vidal garcia of stealing 44 pounds of 
cocaine from a dentist last year in guadalajara along with 
constanzo and constanzos righthand man who posed as us drug 
agents 
constanzo a 26yearold cubanamerican and his lieutenant died 
may 6 in a shootout with police in mexico city 
cult members told police that vidal garcia used his position as 
a federal agent to protect the smugglers coello insisted vidal 
garcia is the only federal agent linked to the cult 
among the cults victims was mark kilroy a 21yearold 
university of texas premed student he was kidnapped tortured and 
mutilated in what sect members say was a ceremony to invoke magical 
protection for the narcotics business

major goal is to create one christian church that cares about the 
whole world 
our highest allegiance is not to one denomination or one 
nation the rev patricia mcclurg said friday at a symposium on 
the future preceding tuesdays start of the 201st general assembly 
of the presbyterian church usa when we are doing our work

question why did the bureaucrat cross the road 
answer because the underground passage built by the city and 
state from opposite directions didnt meet in the middle 
only in chicago could we be building our tunnel and they be 
building their tunnel and i guess we missed mayor richard m 
daley joked friday about the pedway linking city hall and the state 
of illinois building across randolph street 
but he got serious when he told reporters he was demanding a 
full report on who was to blame for the mixup and why the city has 
agreed to pay for about 240000 worth of corrections 
the states portion was a few inches too far east of the citys 
eight to be exact and a few more inches below nine 
the problem started when the city hired contractors to dig its 
half of the pedway and the state contracted with other people to do 
their half the result was a fouryear delay in opening the tunnel 
the opening is now set for september 
the mixup sounds like an episode from a comic opera but at 
least one taxpayer is not amused 
the city screwed up or the state screwed up but either way 
us taxpayers get the bill so whats new said james mcgee 
standing outside city hall and in front of a plywood wall erected 
to keep pedestrians from the work site 
i came down here to get my vehicle sticker and im glad i did 
the way the city is throwing away money added mcgee a 
meatcutter itll probably cost me more next year 
the city appropriated 240000 to cover the cost of correcting 
the mistakes said mayoral spokeswoman marj halperin a published 
figure of 309000 included money spent on noncorrective work she 
said 
the changes include a new steelframe skeleton to accomodate a 
stairway instead of a ramp and the addition of an elevator stop at 
city hall to give the handicapped the same access to the pedway 
that was lost when the ramp had to be scrapped 
to put it simply we planned a 100footlong ramp from city 
hall into the pedway said john c hill the citys coordinating 
architect but we had to scrap it because hooking the segments as 
they sit right now would leave a slope too steep for the state code 
regarding handicapped access 
that meant abandoning a lot of what was there and redoing it 
we were both supposed to come in at 22 feet 4 inches below ground 
level and somebody didnt hill concluded 
that somebody isnt the state insists capital development board 
spokeswoman mia jazo 
we dont want to get into any more fingerpointing she 
said but our portion is exactly where it should be

thailand will test all apples imported 
into the country following the discovery that some apples from the 
united states and other countries contained excessive levels of the 
chemical alar a thai food and drug administration official said 
today 
pakdee pothisiri said the agency has fixed the maximum safety 
limit of alar the trade name for daminozide and used to regulate 
the ripening of apples at 20 parts per million those found to 
exceed this level will be taken off the market he said 
the united states is the largest apple exporter to thailand 
in washington uniroyal chemical co announced friday that it 
was voluntarily halting domestic sales of the chemical because it 
wanted to calm consumer fears 
the environmental protection agency has said it plans to ban the 
use of daminozide in food products because tests in laboratory 
animals have linked a byproduct of alar with cancer after the 
chemical is heated final action on the proposed regulation is not 
expected until next year 
some apples from the united states canada and australia 
recently tested by health inspectors had a higher content of alar 
than this level pothisiri said 
local newspapers said apple sales in thailand have recently 
dropped by 80 percent following warnings from the public health 
ministry about apples contaminated with excessive alar

the new 355 million skydome stadium is the 
latest symbol of torontos rise to major league stature but it has 
also led to questions about traffic congestion crime and urban 
woes in canadas largest city 
residents have poured civic pride into preparations for this 
evenings gala for the worlds first stadium with a retractable 
roof but many residents wonder how this fastgrowing city can 
handle more downtown crowds 
the concerns however go much further than downtown to address 
the quality of life throughout the booming metropolitan area which 
has reached a population of nearly 4 million decades sooner than 
expected 
were really to some extent choking on our growth said john 
bossons an economics professor at the university of toronto who 
long has been involved in municipal issues weve been too 
successful in a sense 
he recalled a transportation study of five or six years ago that 
projected a metropolitan population of 4 million by the year 2011 
five million people in metropolitan toronto which had half that 
many residents in 1971 now seems more appropriate for 2011 
the 60000seat skydome at the foot of the landmark cn tower 
will be the home of the toronto blue jays of baseballs american 
league and the canadian football leagues toronto argonauts 
the skydome roof was designed to open or close in 20 minutes 
but inspectors found exposed wiring missing sprinklers and faulty 
fire prevention devices among 150 deficiencies an operating permit 
finally was granted thursday but critics say deficiencies remain 
in the stadium which they call another example of development run 
amuck 
critics also predict that fans will swamp already crowded 
streets and highways with the extra traffic to the complex 
toronto has prided itself on keeping residential neighborhoods 
near downtown its public transit system still is considered a 
model movie set designers have to scatter garbage on the streets 
when trying to make toronto look like an american city 
not short on civic cheer the city is seeking the 1996 summer 
olympics and a worlds fair for the year 2000 
pat petersen director of the urban studies program at the 
university of toronto said residents are troubled at their 
recollections of a calmer different toronto 10 or 15 years ago 
it isnt that its bad its just becoming a city she said 
supporters of a movement that promises to firmly regulate 
development won a majority of city council seats in a municipal 
election late last year 
it was very very clear in the election that people were 
really concerned about what they perceive as a decline in the 
quality of life bosson said 
were a city at the crossroads jack layton one of the most 
visible council members said in an interview i think the city 
has been a little too smug in thinking of itself as such a 
success 
he said the housing problems in toronto should be getting more 
attention than stadiumbuilding 
a newspaper poll of 1800 people taken for a 10part series in 
the toronto star last month found that 356 percent of city 
residents were more afraid of walking alone at night than five 
years ago and 48 percent more afraid of riding the subway alone at 
night 
we still brag that canadas largest city doesnt have half the 
problems that are sucking the life out of urban america the 
series wrote but suddenly we arent so sure that it cant happen 
to us 
housing costs have soared in the economic boom that has lasted 
through most of the decade pushing the average cost of a toronto 
home to more than 232000 and making affordable housing a 
prime city issue 
the only other canadian city that even comes close is vancouver 
where the average price has risen to 176700 the average housing 
price in montreal is 92600 and in edmonton alberta 71600

opec ministers say discussions have 
barely begun on whether to produce more oil at a time when prices 
of a barrel have surged 40 percent since november 
nigerian oil minister rilwanu lukman the president of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries said officials 
discussed the whole agenda during private talks friday he 
would not elaborate 
the ministers of the 13nation group were meeting privately 
today to try to work out a production agreement for the last half 
of the year their formal strategy session begins monday 
most ministers appear unwilling to adopt tactics that could 
upset what has been a surprisingly strong market so far this year 
indeed some officials say the ministers may decide to roll over 
the current agreement for another six months 
in november the ministers agreed to curb their production and 
set a cap of 185 million barrels a day they settled on a 
benchmark price of 18 a barrel 
since then the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by 
opec has shot up rising more than 40 percent to nearly 1770 a 
barrel 
west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude has been 
trading around 20 a barrel 
prices have been pushed up not only by opecs output cuts but 
also by accidents in oilproducing areas they have combined to 
trim the supply of oil on the world market 
in their bargaining the ministers will discuss whether to 
maintain their output cap or lift it to 195 million or 20 million 
barrels a day as several countries have requested 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab

president bush plans to press 25 us cities 
to begin converting to alternative fuels as early as 1992 to battle 
urban smog a newspaper reported today 
the most stringent of the four options bush is considering would 
require that 50 percent of all new cars trucks and buses in the 25 
cities be required to run on alternative fuels by 1995 the los 
angeles times reported 
the least stringent option would require only buses and official 
automobiles in those cities to use alternative fuels but would 
accelerate the deadline to 1992 the times said 
the cities were not identified in the 42page white house 
document prepared by the presidents domestic policy council and 
obtained by the times but the cities would include los angeles 
new york chicago houston denver and other major urban areas the 
times said 
the presidents alternative fuels plan represents the central 
element of his effort to revive and overhaul the federal effort 
stalled under the reagan administration to combat pollution in 
major cities 
alternative fuels including compressed natural gas methanol 
and ethanol burn more cleanly than gasoline and reduce the 
production of ozone the major component of smog 
even the stringent pollutionreduction plan outlined for the 
president would leave 23 cities in violation of federal air 
standards by the year 2005 last summer 81 cities fell short of 
the federal standards 
the cost of the various proposals was not outlined in the 
document presented to bush but estimates range from 21 billion 
to 46 billion the times said 
the report says that the use of alternative fuels would 
obviate the need for other more costly automobile controls on 
emissions controls such as changes in tail pipes and fuel pumps 
have been strongly opposed by us auto makers 
the report also suggests that cities be given the opportunity to 
opt out of the alternative fuels requirement if they can find 
other was to reduce smog substantially 
the report was presented to bush before he left last weekend for 
europe it faces final review monday during a meeting of the 
domestic policy council

activists demonstrating this weekend at 
the seabrook nuclear power plant say the imminent start of atomic 
testing at the reactor should help their cause 
now its beginning to sound real before it was sounding kind 
of nebulous wes crocheron of the antinuclear clamshell alliance 
said friday night as the first demonstrators began trickling into 
this seacoast town 
people are fired up against the nuke especially now that they 
got the lowpower testing license crocheron said 
the nuclear regulatory commission gave seabrook a lowpower 
testing licence last week the first atomic chain reaction is 
expected at the reactor by the middle of next week 
the alliance was planning a major rally today at hampton beach 
state park on the crowded beach peninsula less than two miles from 
seabrook that is a focal point of the struggle over whether the 6 
billion reactor ever will operate commercially evacuation plans 
for the beaches and communities up to 10 miles away from the plant 
must be approved before the plant may operate commercially 
on sunday the activists plan a mass civil disobedience action 
at the plant site clamshell spokesman paul gunter said at least 
300 to 500 people already had undergone nonviolent civil 
disobedience training and more training sessions were being held 
throughout the weekend 
on friday superior court judge vincent dunn denied seabrook 
town officials request for an injunction against sundays 
demonstration 
seabrook police chief paul cronin indicated friday police may 
arrest demonstrators before they reach the plant gates on sunday

clinicians are preserving transplant organs for 
longer periods in an improved chemical solution that is healthier 
for patients and gives doctors more leeway in scheduling surgery 
this solution is clearly better than whats been available 
its a major advance in transplantation said dr robert gordon 
associate professor of surgery at the university of pittsburgh 
the biggest impact has been in liver transplants where half of 
all organs go to waste because of logistical and organizational 
problems said the university of wisconsins dr folkert belzer 
who developed the solution 
his mixture previously available to select transplant centers 
on an experimental basis was approved for general use last month 
by the us food and drug administration 
the solution includes hormones amino acids and sugars it 
prevents tissue swelling and cell deterioration from the time the 
organ is removed from a braindead victim until it is transplanted 
under the older preservation method livers were chilled and 
flushed with eurocollins solution a mix of electrolytes and 
glucose 
with the older solution surgical teams had to spring into 
action as soon as donor organs were found and transplant candidates 
had to live near the center transplants often began in the middle 
of the night with one operation sometimes starting as soon as 
another finished 
organs regularly were turned down because of a lack of doctors 
or surgical space 
this is the first time weve ever been able to do a liver and 
pancreas electively belzer said friday at the annual meeting of 
the american society of transplant surgeons 
the wisconsin solution called viaspan and marketed by du pont 
has allowed for greater sharing of organs last fall for example 
a liver was shipped from toronto to paris and successfully 
transplanted another was shipped from the united states to brazil 
its also enabled doctors to trim livers for young recipients or 
split them for two patients when necessary 
studies in the united states and europe have found livers can be 
preserved safely outside the body for as long as 36 hours with the 
solution compared to a maximum six to eight hours with other 
methods said dr james southard of the university of wisconsin 
pancreases have been stored for as long as 29 hours with the 
solution southard said 
the preservation time for kidneys remains about the same 30 to 
40 hours regardless of which solution is used southard said but 
studies show recipients of kidneys preserved in the wisconsin 
mixture do not return as often to dialysis because of organ 
rejection and other problems

conservative episcopalians reacting to 
the election of the first woman bishop have created a new 
association to transform their denomination 
nearly 2000 people attended the founding meeting of the 
episcopal synod of america friday the delegates adopted a 
constitution friday and planned to end their meeting today 
the dissident church members said they were displeased with 
loosening strictures on marriage tolerance of homosexuality 
feminist theology revisions of liturgical language to be 
genderinclusive and what they saw as slackening standards of 
personal morality in the episcopal church 
if we remain a church within the church our goal isnt to be 
a small cell but to be a witness to hopefully transform our 
religion said bishop david schofield of the episcopal diocese of 
san joaquin in fresno calif 
but members of the new church say they do not intend to break 
with the nearly 25 millionmember episcopal church which has lost 
about a quarter of its members since doctrinal controversies 
reached their peak in the mid1970s the church is one of 27 
branches of the 70 millionmember anglican communion worldwide 
bishop clarence pope of fort worth was elected president of the 
new association he said the episcopal churchs laws do not prevent 
the traditionalists from forming a voluntary association and he 
called for the acceptance of the new organization as a way for 
traditionalists to stay within the church 
twentyone other episcopal bishops 16 of them retired have 
endorsed the synod 
leaders of the fort worthbased evangelical and catholic 
mission a traditionalist group called the synod after the rev 
barbara harris was consecrated as the first female episcopal bishop 
last year in massachusetts 
this year we will have women bishops next year theyll delete 
a book or two from the new testament said oswald clark a lay 
member of the general synod church of the church of england the 
substance of the question remains the same on what ground do you 
stand 
the new synod passed a resolution recommending usage of the 1928 
book of common prayer which is discouraged by the church 
alongside the 1979 revision

prime minister sousuke uno and his cabinet today 
convened for the first time but doubts remain whether the public 
will be satisfied by what opposition politicians called a stopgap 
government 
parliament elected uno as japans 47th prime minister friday to 
replace noboru takeshita who resigned because of an 
influencepeddling scandal unos appointment ended the governing 
liberal democratic partys fiveweek search for a candidate 
untainted by the scandal 
the new government was formally approved by emperor akihito in 
an afternoon ceremony at the imperial palace in central tokyo the 
first meeting of unos 21member cabinet followed at the prime 
ministers official residence 
opposition political parties and many analysts said they expect 
uno to last only a few months perhaps departing this summer if the 
liberal democrats fare poorly in an election expected in july for 
half the seats in the upper house 
during an 80minute news conference after his first cabinet 
meeting however the 66yearold former foreign minister said he 
expected to be a success it is not an interim cabinet and i can 
tell you that it will be a cabinet which will be highly 
appraised he said 
uno said he had changed some of the party practices and declared 
that all the cabinet members agreed to put priority on carrying 
out various reforms 
asked if he would be influenced in any way by former prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasone the longtime leader of the party 
faction in which uno was a senior member uno reminded reporters he 
quit the faction upon assuming the premiership and that nakasone 
resigned from the party because of the scandal 
i highly admire the former prime minister for his achievements 
but ill do it my own way uno said 
uno has pledged a clean start for japanese politics which 
have been stained by the scandal in which recruit co an 
information services conglomerate tried to buy favors from senior 
politicians and bureaucrats 
the most pressing task for uno will be to reverse low public 
approval ratings for his party before next months elections for 
the upper house of parliament the liberal democrats have 
controlled both houses of parliament since 1955 but political 
observers say the party could lose its hold on government as a 
result of the recruit scandal 
unos choice as party secretary general ryutaro hashimoto told 
reporters on friday he had received 17000 in 198586 from the 
recruit co the new chief cabinet secretary masajuro shiokawa 
said he gave an unsigned receipt to another liberal democrat who 
used it to divide a large donation from recruit among several 
receipts to skirt legal reporting requirements 
the makeup of the new uno administration which contains six of 
the same cabinet ministers who served under takeshita raises the 
strong suspicion that the liberal democrats have learned nothing 
serious from the recruit scandal the daily japan times wrote in 
an editorial today 
of the 17 politicians or aides involved in purchases of cutrate 
stock offered by recruit 13 were liberal democrats

syrian gunners blasted the christian 
heartland with 400 howitzer shells today and five artillery rounds 
crashed into moslem west beirut in another violation of a 
ceasefire called three weeks ago 
police said they could not determine the source of fire on west 
beirut but the moslemrun voice of the nation radio station blamed 
christian army units of gen michel aoun it was the first time 
that west beirut has been shelled since an arab league ceasefire 
was called may 11 
although syrian gunners had been harassing the christian 
heartland with daily shelling todays barrage was the most severe 
in three weeks it engulfed the coastal stertch north of beirut 
the presidential palace in suburban baabda and the nearby hadath 
and kfar shima districts 
no casualties were reported mainly because most of the shells 
crashed into the christian and moslem neighborhoods at dawn while 
people were indoors 
an aide to aoun said we wont remain idle if the ceasefire 
violations persist the general is not prepared to accept the 
intensifying shelling 
we will be forced to fire back he said on condition of 
anonymity 
he denied the army had fired on west beirut today he accused 
syrian gunners of hitting the christians and the moslems so that 
our citizens in the western sector would have the impression that 
we are shelling them 
the aide said christian gunners would not take any action until 
after a meeting sunday in casablanca morocco of a committee the 
arab league appointed to seek a solution to the crisis in lebanon 
peace will prevail if the leaders adopt a clear decision on 
consolidating the ceasefire and lifting the blockades the aide 
said if they fail to stop the syrian violation of the ceaefire 
then we will have to fire back 
the latest round of fighting in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
began march 8 when aoun ordered a blockade of illegal ports run by 
moslem militias south of beirut the syrians and moslems retaliated 
by shelling the christian heartland then blockading the 
310squaremile enclave

the salesmanartist who painted the first 
cocacola wall sign was no rembrandt but 95 years later his work 
is getting about as much attention from restorers as any 
masterpiece 
preservationists alison free and aggie ferguson have put in a 
month of painstaking work on the side of young brothers pharmacy in 
cartersville about 30 miles northwest of atlanta to bring to 
light what atlantabased cocacola executives agree is the first of 
its kind 
restoring the large redandwhite sign which says drink 
cocacola was the idea of the pharmacys owner dean cox who 
said townspeople had told him he had a historic treasure under 
layers of paint on the stores wall 
id heard the rumor for years cox said and then i 
finally got confirmation from cocacola that this was the first 
painted wall sign 
cocacola representative randy donaldson said the original sign 
was painted in 1894 by salesman james couden who set the precedent 
for what later became a standard offer sell cocacola in your shop 
and the company would paint your wall for free 
couden was a salesman first and painter next donaldson said 
friday night so his sign is not quite up to specs the letters 
are kind of squashed 
ms free described them as chunky and said she found another 
feature that attests to coudens amateur status as a painter 
he left the i out of drink she said it looks like he 
left it out and then stuck it back in there its crammed up with 
the n 
she and miss ferguson who operate a restoration company called 
signs of the times had a difficult time getting to the point where 
they could critique the sign they said what they had thought would 
be a fiveday job ended up taking almost 30 
the task was made difficult because they could not be sure that 
the cocacola sign was the first paint put on the brick wall 
if we had taken all the paint off except the bottom layer in 
the beginning we could have lost the sign miss ferguson said 
so they used heat guns and spatulas to chip away at a section of 
the wall that held a modern cocacola sign after going through 
layer after layer of cocacola advertising they found the original 
sign 
after the oldest cocacola sign was exposed the painters worked 
at matching the original colors they plan to repaint it next week 
the extra work boosted the cost of the restoration project cox 
said the final bill will be 8000 to 10000 he is paying most of 
the tab but donaldson said cocacola will pay part 
i hope the state will put up a historical marker cox said 
but if not i will or maybe cocacola will

president bush says he brought a 
message of hope back from his triumphant weeklong trip to 
europe but says he doesnt expect soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev to respond soon to arms control initiatives embraced by 
nato nations 
theres no grand design out there right now now we just want 
to move forward bush told reporters 
the president went for an earlymorning jog near his oceanside 
estate and told reporters he had trouble sleeping first waking up 
at 3 am and then rising at 445 am 
the president planned to go fishing today in his boat and was to 
meet in the afternoon with senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine and maine gov john s mckernan 
asked if hed heard yet from gorbachev the president shouted as 
he jogged past a group of reporters no phone calls yet 
he is scheduled to return to washington on sunday 
at an arrival ceremony at nearby pease air force base in 
portsmouth nh on friday bush declared we must stay on the 
offensive we must now get to work to end the cold war 
i am now returning from europe with a message for the american 
people a message of hope bush told a jubilant gathering 
attended by a welcoming crowd of several thousand invited guests 
many of them schoolchildren we have a great and historic 
opportunity to shape the changes that are transforming europe 
bush basking in praise from allies of his proposal for dramatic 
troop reductions in europe and for resolving a nato dispute over 
shortrange missiles told reporters on air force one shortly 
before his arrival that he had not heard directly from gorbachev on 
the proposals 
he added you dont expect an instant answer but im 
confident we will and i hope its positive 
it will be a while until a formal soviet response he 
suggested 
on prospects of a summit meeting this year with the soviet 
leader bush said ive always felt that we eventually will get 
together and should 
but the president gave no clues on when such a meeting might 
take place and dismissed suggestions that he and gorbachev might 
cross paths when bush returns to europe next month for the 
sevennation economic summit of industrial democracies in paris a 
trip that will also take him to the warsaw pact countries of poland 
and hungary 
i think the first priority is to follow through on the 
collective decision that nato has takenso weve got some work to 
do to make this nato decision into a reality but im determined to 
kick our bureaucracy and the nato bureaucracy as best i can to 
push it forward bush said 
after arriving in this seacoast resort the president 
immediately headed out into the atlantic on his 28foot speedboat 
fidelity on a fishing trip spending about two hours out 
before rain and a smoking engine forced him to return to port he 
pointed gleefully to a mackerel that his fishing party had caught 
as he returned to the marina where he keeps his boat 
bush had no public appearances planned before he returns to 
washington on sunday afternoon 
in his arrival remarks bush said his proposal for conventional 
arms cuts in europe which would include the withdrawal of 30000 
us troops was bold but fundamentally fair 
at the summit bush proposed a drastic reduction in eastwest 
conventional forces in europe and said the cuts should come by 1993 
at bushs urging nato nations also agreed to a compromise 
settlement of a dispute over shortrange nuclear missiles that will 
enable the weapons to be put on the negotiating table after a 
conventional arms deal is completed the united states and britain 
had voiced skepticism of such negotiations while west germany 
wanted them immediately 
bush said the compromise demonstrated that nato could manage 
change while remaining true to the strategy of deterrence which has 
kept the peace for the past 40 years 
in his talk with reporters on air force one bush was asked if 
he felt his assertiveness in seeking to seize the initiative from 
gorbachev by proposing new disarmament initiatives in europe had 
won him new respect at home 
mentioning comedian rodney dangerfield whose complaints about 
not getting respect became a classic comedy line bush said you 
mean like rodney dangerfield kind of thing ive not suffered from 
lack of respect 
but bush allowed that he felt pretty good about the events 
of the past few days

president lee tenghui said today that if 
taiwan wants to regain international recognition it must admit that 
the communists rule mainland china 
lees statement was the first public acknowledgment by a 
taiwanese leader that the communists control the mainland 
he made it at the opening session of a threeday congress of the 
governing nationalist party which has ruled taiwan since the 
nationalists lost the mainland to the communists in a 1949 civil 
war 
we should have the courage to face the situation that for the 
time being we are unable to exert effective rule over the 
mainland lee told delegates who included aged nationalist 
officials who fought in the war 
however he refused to relinquish the nationalist claim to the 
mainland 
there is only one china and the country will be reunified 
eventually the ultimate goal of our foreign policy is to keep the 
nations sovereignty intact he said 
lee also reiterated what is popularly known as taiwans three 
no policy toward the communists no official contacts no 
compromise and no talks 
his address was considered a veiled criticism of the partys 
conservative old guard whose refusal to acknowledge communist rule 
of china has been blamed for taiwans diplomatic isolation 
only 23 countries recognize the nationalists compared to 136 
that have diplomatic ties with china 
lee said he believes a more flexible and pragmatic foreign 
policy will encourage many countries to readjust their 
shortsighted china policy and recognize his nationalist 
government 
the nationalists he said continue to support a studentled 
democracy movement in china because the protesters are linked to 
us by blood in their fight for freedom democracy and survival 
also today the partys newly appointed secretarygeneral james 
soong told delegates taiwan never will use force to reunify china 
the reunified china we are seeking shall be guided by the free 
will of all the chinese and the principles of democracy said 
soong

hundreds of people ate hot dogs and 
listened to music today at a party thrown for the city where pan am 
flight 103 tumbled to earth but relatives of crash victims said 
the good time was in bad taste 
ed blaus a 14yearold from sicklerville nj who suggested 
the idea for the party to lift the citys spirits said he was 
surprised to learn the party had been dubbed eds party 
i just want all the kids to come here and enjoy themselves 
because they missed christmas and everyone should have a 
christmas he said 
a bomb on board flight 103 exploded over lockerbie four days 
before christmas killing all 259 people on the plane and 11 on the 
ground burning wreckage from the new yorkbound boeing 747 
destroyed several lockerbie homes 
relatives of some victims said the party was in poor taste 
i have been talking with a number of those people bereaved by 
this outrage and without exception they are saying that holding 
this party is repugnant and abhorrent jim swire spokesman for 
the uk familiesflight 103 group said today 
swires daughter died in the explosion 
blaus who read about the bombing in the newspapers and in 
letters from lockerbie pen pal david stewart said he first wanted 
to send presents to lockerbie but his idea just grew 
i wrote to pan am because i thought that everyone should have 
a christmas no matter what i just wanted them to send presents 
over and they said they would help me he said 
but it just got bigger and bigger i never thought it would be 
called eds party but here i am and i am going to eat pizza 
pan am flew blaus his parents and three brothers to lockerbie 
but pan am has said it was not organizing the party 
community leader alex mcelroy said the party was supported by 
most local people not to cause distress or anguish but to prove 
to themselves and the world that whereas we mourn those who died 
they are determined to repair their town rebuild shattered lives 
and ensure a special and sacred place in their hearts for the 270 
people from 24 nations who died 
complaints from relatives of the victims led the disney 
organization to cancel plans to send mickey mouse to the party and 
the hebrew national company decided against supplying hot dogs

a previously unknown moslem group 
today claimed it planted a small bomb that exploded in front of the 
us agency for international development 
the homemade bomb which caused no injuries apparently was 
intended for the neighboring indian high commission 
police said it was hurled from a moving vehicle friday after 
riot police fired tear gas and bullets to disperse 500 moslem 
demonstrators trying to march to the indian high commission 
moslems accuse indian peacekeeping troops of failing to prevent 
clashes between tamils and moslems in which at least 13 people were 
killed last month most tamils are hindu and both groups are 
ethnic minorities among the majority sinhalese buddhists 
newspaper offices today received statements from the noorul 
islamic liberation front claiming responsibility for the bomb 
police said they have not heard of the group 
indian troops were sent to northern and eastern sri lanka in 
1987 to enforce a peace accord to end a tamil separatist revolt 
moslems accuse the tamils of trying to force them as well as 
the sinhalese out of eastern province the provinces population 
is equally divided among the three ethnic groups tamils account 
for 18 percent and moslems 7 percent of sri lankas 16 million

the oncebustling christian enclave 
north of beirut is a ghost town daily shelling by syrian forces 
has driven most residents underground and sapped the life from the 
region once known as the monte carlo of the middle east 
the barrages have eased since the arab league called for a 
ceasefire may 11 but a gas shortage has paralyzed the region 
adding to the problems of a christian population outnumbered and 
outgunned by syria and its allies 
if its not shelling its gas and if its not gas its 
something else said samira khater a secretary 
an air of stupor hangs over the 310squaremile enclave home to 
about 1 million christians 
there is hardly any traffic business is slow factories that 
survived 11 weeks of ferocious shelling limp along with skeleton 
staffs and whatever fuel they can scrounge 
restaurants are lucky if they get 10 customers a day half the 
shops hidden behind sandbags and earthfilled oildrums are 
shuttered 
the night life that once throbbed in the clubs bars and 
restaurants along the mediterranean coastline is dead 
the famous casino du liban where oilrich sheiks and high 
rollers from around the world gambled is closed 
it was a regular target for syrian gunners who have battled the 
forces of christian leader gen michel aoun since march 8 in some 
of the most savage battles of lebanons 14yearold civil war 
some 360 people have been killed and nearly 1400 wounded 
mostly civilians 
the christians are tired and dispirited struggling to cope with 
a grim fatalism 
the syrians maintain their blockade of the christian enclave 
ringed on its landward sides by hostile moslem forces 
small cargo ships run the gauntlet of shellfire to bring in food 
and ammunition for the christians so there is no shortage of those 
items but the blockade runners dont try bringing in gas 
it only takes one hit to blow up a ship loaded with fuel a 
police spokesman said 
supermarkets bulge with imported goods pink chamapagne 
passion fruit tea 10 brands of whisky cookies chocolates hams 
cheeses 
fruit and vegetables are in short supply but available for a 
price before the fighting most produce came from 
syriancontrolled areas now they are smuggled in at night by mule 
train from the north 
the enclaves fuel reserves went up in flames when a syrian 
barrage blew up the seaside dora depot in east beirut two months 
ago 
the french lebanons colonial rulers until 1943 and the 
christians traditional protector shipped in 4000 tons of fuel to 
reactivate closed power plants a few weeks ago 
but theres precious little gasoline around only about 
onefifth of filling stations bother to open 
police said two people have been killed and 10 wounded in 
gunfights over gas 
a worker at one filling station who did not want to be 
identified said it opens only when the army can send a tank to 
maintain order 
thats why people have to wait for days in front of the 
stations and all they get in the end is 10 liters a little more 
than two gallons he said 
gas costs about 350 for 5 gallons but on the black market 
the same amount is going for 50 a months wages for many 
lebanese 
filling station owners pump out the gas from their tanks and 
sell it on the black market for 10 times the price said one 
motorist 
long lines of cars some extending for a mile sit outside many 
stations 
at first everyone used to wait for days in their cars even 
during the shelling grocer samir madi said now we take turns 
to wait for a station to open 
when it does whoevers keeping vigil telephones everyone else 
and they all rush to the station 
the casualties and damage wrought by aouns war of 
liberation to drive the syrians out of lebanon has turned many 
christians against the man many hail as their hero 
aoun has used the christian people said one young man who 
declined to be identified hes led them into a dark tunnel of 
hunger death and siege because of his personal ambition to become 
president

president bushs breakneck timetable 
for wrapping up a conventional arms agreement with the soviet union 
may be too optimistic given the complexity of the negotiations 
analysts say 
but they say the presidents sweeping proposals for slashing 
troops and weapons in europe will broaden eastwest bargaining at 
the vienna arms talks and ensure that an eventual accord will be 
wideranging 
it will be a more comprehensive set of negotiations and a more 
comprehensive agreement said richard fieldhouse a research 
fellow at the stockholm international peace research institute in 
sweden 
that also means he said it will be more difficult 
bush wants the talks brought to an early and satisfactory 
conclusion within six to 12 months and their results implemented 
no later than 1993 
john cross deputy director of the londonbased international 
institute for strategic studies said the bush initiative 
produces better prospects than hitherto for striking an arms 
control bargain 
but he cautioned it will be impossibly hard without an 
enormous amount of good will between the east and west 
negotiators to bring the talks to an end a year from now 
bushs unveiling of the plan at a summit of the north atlantic 
treaty organization was an attempt by the west to seize the arms 
control initiative from soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
it also let the leaders of the 16 nato nations emerge from their 
40th anniversary celebration united 
they got their act together and confirmed they have very much 
more in common on what really matters said cross 
the presidents bargaining offer calls for sharp cuts in soviet 
and american troops stationed in europe and in tanks artillery and 
other conventional or nonnuclear arms 
moreover bush said the united states in a turnabout would be 
willing to negotiate reductions in combat aircraft and helicopters 
the inclusion of aircraft analysts say will expand the 
discussions to an important area of concern but it also will make 
the talks tougher because of the difficulty in defining attack 
planes 
bush also urged that the two sides agree to destroy all weapons 
that are singled out for reductions and that the troops be 
disbanded 
his proposal was unanimously adopted by the other 15 delegates 
at the meeting at nato headquarters in brussels 
they agreed to let experts take a look at the plan and draw up a 
detailed offer to put on the bargaining table when talks resume in 
september the conventional forces in europe negotiations began 
last march between the nato nations and the sovietled warsaw pact 
they cover the region spanning the atlantic ocean to the ural 
mountains in the soviet union 
analysts had predicted the discussions would last several years 
at least previous negotiations dragged on 15 years with no 
agreement 
fieldhouse said its clear enough that the two alliances have 
similar enough objectives and enough common ground to reach an 
accord 
such an agreement said cross would reduce substantially the 
military threat in europe but not erase the military might 
the soviet union he said will remain a powerful force and nato 
will have enough strength to mount a defense if needed 
under the american plan troop densities would be thinned 
bush proposed that both sides reduce their troop strength in 
europe to 275000 on each side that would mean a cut according to 
us estimates of 350000 for the soviets and 30000 for the 
united states 
natos opening position would require the warsaw pact to big 
massive cuts in main battle tanks artillery and armored troop 
carriers considered key forces in an invasion or surprise attack 
the west would make smaller trims of 5 percent to 10 percent in 
those categories 
the nato allies want the east bloc nations to clip their forces 
to a level equal with the west and below natos current holdings 
bushs arms control offer helped solve a bitter alliance dispute 
over the future role of shortrange nuclear weapons in europe 
germany had demanded that nato enter early talks with the 
soviets on reducing tactical nuclear missiles in europe 
the united states and britain argued attention should first be 
placed on the soviet unions enormous superiority in nonnuclear 
weapons 
the leaders final statement said they would be prepared to 
discuss a partial reduction in battlefield nuclear missiles but 
only after implementation of a conventional arms accord was under 
way 
by underscoring the word partial the united states and 
britain were able to halt at least temporarily a german push for 
elimination of all those weapons 
bowing to german pleas the allies also agreed to put off key 
decisions on introducing and deploying a more powerful generation 
of shortrange nuclear missiles until 1992

soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev is the most popular foreign leader west germany has known 
and rates much higher than chancellor helmut kohl according to 
poll results released saturday 
the der spiegel newsmagazine which conducted the poll said the 
only west german politician more popular than gorbachev is 
president richard von weizsaecker 
it augurs well for the soviet leaders june 1215 visit to this 
country but could be ominous for kohl who faces federal elections 
in 1990 
the magazine asked 2000 west german voters to rate gorbachev 
and west german politicians on a popularity scale from minus five 
to plus five 
gorbachev received 22 while kohl was rated at minus 06 
president bush who paid a 25hour visit to west germany last 
week received 07 while french president francois mitterrand also 
lagged behind gorbachev with 17 
even john f kennedy and charles de gaulle at their peaks were 
not as popular as gorbachev der spiegel said 
only weizsaecker fared better than gorbachev the magazine said 
but it did say what rating he received the presidency is a mostly 
ceremonial post in west germany 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher who has been leading 
west german calls for closer ties to the soviet union and more 
disarmament talks received a 14 rating 
der spiegel said even west germans who usually vote for kohls 
conservative christian democratic union rated gorbachev nearly as 
high as the chancellor giving kohl 20 and gorbachev 19 
among those voters 95 percent find gorbachev farsighted 94 
percent think he is full of ideas and 95 percent say he is 
hardworking the magazine said 
a parallel survey was conducted for the magazine by the 
sociology institute of the soviet academy of sciences which polled 
1000 moscow citizens 
only 59 percent of those polled in moscow said they are 
convinced gorbachevs reform policies will succeed the magazine 
said in the west german poll 82 percent said they believe 
gorbachev will succeed 
according to der spiegel 76 percent of muscovites queried 
replied that perestroika will not be supported by the population 
any more if the supply situation does not improve 
it said 61 percent of moscow residents polled think the soviet 
economy is in bad or very bad shape 
der spiegel released a summary of the survey results in advance 
of the magazines publication monday

pope john paul ii pleaded for the 
reconciliation of all christians on his arrival today in iceland 
which has 1800 roman catholics among its mainly lutheran 
population of 244000 
starting the second leg of a fivenation scandinavian tour in 
one of the most unpolluted countries of the world the pope also 
noted that people everywhere are beginning to recognize that the 
pursuit of materialism is threatening the environment 
he also said people throughout the world are increasingly aware 
that peace among nations can only be the fruit of a just economic 
and social order 
prime minister steingrimur hermannsson welcomed him at keflavik 
airport on a grey and chilly day saying the pope was received as 
a true servant of the god in whom we believe regardless of the 
church to which we may belong 
christianity was established as the official church in iceland 
1000 years ago but roman catholicism was vanquished by the 
protestant reformation in the 16th century 
the pope said part of this 24hour visit to iceland would seek 
to encourage the good relations which have developed between 
iceland catholics and the members of other ecclesial communities 
despite the tragic divisions which have long separated 
christians all of us must try to live in fidelity to the lords 
will to be instruments of his reconciliation to maintain the 
unity of the spirit in the bond of peace 
at the airport the pope kissed the ground as soon as he stepped 
off his plane a gesture he makes in every country he visits for 
the first time 
a crowd of youngsters waved icelandic flags and the pope kissed 
two young girls who presented him with flowers in the red blue and 
white colors of icelands flag 
the pope flew to this northernmost capital in the world just 
below the arctic circle from tromsoe norway where he extolled 
marriage and strong family values in a country where many couples 
live together without getting married 
police took into custody four people as the pope celebrated mass 
in the market square of tromsoe which is 200 miles north of the 
arctic circle two women were detained for protesting closer 
relations with the catholic church and two men criticized the 
vaticans human rights record 
police estimated fewer than 1000 people attended in one of the 
smallest crowds at an openair mass on the popes 42 foreign trips 
speaking from a wooden altar john paul touched on an issue of 
concern to the churches in scandinavia where about 50 percent of 
the couples never marry and most children today are born out of 
wedlock 
the love of a married couple unites them but it also enables 
them to become cooperators with god in giving life to a new person 
he said speaking in english 
thus they establish the most basic of human communities the 
family which he said was a fundamental gift 
catholic officials have complained of the difficulty of 
encouraging traditional values in a secular atmosphere 
john paul also is visiting finland denmark and sweden on his 
10day tour only about 1 percent of scandanavians are catholic 
lutheran churches are taxfinanced and part of the state 
bureaucracy

one congressman compares the atmosphere in the 
house these days to the bloody battlefields of world war i where 
sticking your head out of the trench might get it shot at 
another calls up the memory of dirty tricks used by the nixon white 
house to wage political warfare 
an evil wind is blowing says a democratic chairman jack 
brooks of texas a republican vin weber of minnesota talks of the 
outbreak of ethics war jim wright in shedding the 
speakership said mindless cannibalism had been let loose 
last week house members found that the political ground rules 
seemed to be shifting the underlying habits of accommodation and 
accord were giving way to a cutthroat partisanship so intense it 
worried some 
louis stokes dohio a former ethics committee chairman said 
if the new mood persists the end result will be to destroy this 
institution as we know it today 
lee hamilton dind said the republicans should stop the 
war if its that because the major concern we ought all to have 
at this point is the institution 
what was new was the prospect of a siege of retribution in the 
house the use of ethics charges as a political tool 
thats not the tradition in the past when the house censured 
members for violating the rules it did so as an institution acting 
as a whole against the transgressions of an individual 
democrats say they see the hand of newly installed republican 
whip newt gingrich of georgia wrights tormentor behind the 
events which put them in disarray last week some suspected they 
were witness to and victims of a campaign that had its 
inspiration outside the house 
the fear is that it is in the hands of the lee atwaters of the 
world said leon panetta dcalif thats the concern 
atwater an aggressive political infighter was a key strategist 
in president bushs campaign last year bush installed him as 
republican national chairman and atwater has set out to end 35 
years of democratic domination of the house 
republicans scoff at the cries of foul play mickey edwards of 
oklahoma said in an interview that if there is poison in the air 
its source was the heavyhanded tactics by wright as speaker 
stacking committees restricting debate maneuvering the minority 
into defeats 
wright would use the rules in any way he could to manipulate 
the outcome of a vote edwards said republicans and many 
democrats felt that it wasnt just a matter of getting outvoted 
it was a matter of not even having a fair shot 
when wright said last week he was sorry if he had contributed to 
the houses bitterness that was ludicrous said edwards he 
was responsible for it more than any human being 
but edwards added that his fellow republicans may be off on a 
dangerous game republicans have not cornered the market on 
morality 
and republican weber said his party has no appetite for 
escalation there is a strong sense that we dont want to start 
ethics wars he told the washington post i dont expect any 
republicans to file charges against democrats 
on the other hand republican bill green ny said ethics is a 
legitimate political issue after all he said youve had two of 
the top three democrats here resign 
if the democrats want to stop what jim wright called the 
mindless cannibalism the place to begin is to call off their 
vendetta against newt gingrich said guy vander jagt of michigan 
chairman of the republican congressional campaign committee 
the democrats believe this is a concerted planned 
coordinated effort said steny hoyer dmd of the republican 
hardball it is a continuation of the 1988 campaign 
the reference of course was to events which caused wright to 
renounce the speakership and his seat after a long ethics 
investigation led the ambitious rep tony coelho of california 
the no 3 democrat to resign from congress rather than face an 
ethics investigation and led fbi agents to question william h 
gray dpa during the memorial day weekend about allegations of 
financial impropriety 
the fbis visit occurred at an awkward time for gray seeking to 
move up in the democratic hierarchy he is a candidate for coelhos 
old job of whip 
hoyer said it all brought to mind tactics of the nixon era 
the nixon years showed us the ability to use executive apparatus 
in political campaigns 
panetta called up the image of world war i trench warfare he 
said he saw a world war i mentality at play in the use of 
ethics charges to savage the democrats 
if the geteven mood prevails gingrich stands out as the 
democrats tempting target a democratic irritant in the best of 
times gingrich is facing an investigation by the ethics committee 
on complaints much like those that brought wright down 
members of both sides who want a truce look to the suretobe 
next speaker democrat thomas foley of washington he was 
universally praised as a conciliator an intellectual fairminded 
and evenhanded if he wants to add peacemaker to those accolades 
opportunity awaits his elevation tuesday to speaker

trademark for the trade union born in gdansk nine years ago 
in his campaign stop solidarity candidate benedykt 
pszczolkowski called for reforms ranging from better treatment of 
farmers to reductions in the bloated communistled government 
but facing more than 70 farmers in the community center friday 
he was careful to avoid raising too many expectations in advance of 
sundays elections for the parliament and a new senate 
we arent making promises that the economy in poland will 
suddenly start to thrive said the thin bearded candidate 
dressed in a natty sport coat at the end of a frenzied twomonth 
campaign 
the people who control the farms dont know the problems for 
example theyre still buying machines that are too big for small 
operations said the candidate himself a farmer with 60 acres in 
the town of pszczolki gorne 18 miles away 
pszczolkowski 38 is hitting emotional issues in a country 
where most farms remain in private hands despite the communist 
system 
he is well aware that party officials also have been making the 
rounds of hundreds of villages nationwide promising to cure 
chronic shortages if theyre given another chance to govern 
shortages in this country of 38 million people are a daily curse 
of life they range from spare parts for tractors to food and vital 
parts for dental care 
they are telling fairy tales the solidarity candidate said 
of the communist party candidates 
speaking from a makeshift podium of two tables pushed together 
and covered by an aging green satin cloth pszczolkowski said 
police should spend more time fighting crime than hunting down 
unauthorized newspapers 
stanislaw weglowski 51 one of two other solidarity candidates 
appearing at the campaign stop called for legal and economic 
reforms 
the factories are running at about 60 percent of their 
capacity because there is a shortage of raw materials said 
weglowski a parliament candidate 
he also called for more housing better education and public 
access to the statedominated mass media 
the candidates are bound to find that demanding sweeping reforms 
in virtually all aspects of public life is easier than implementing 
them 
solidarity chief lech walesa has reminded his supporters that 
plenty of hard work remains after sundays voting and the 
runoff elections on june 18 
when pszczolkowski and the other candidates finished their 
presentations they opened the floor to questions 
one farmer wanted to know whether it was true as staterun 
radio reported that only criminals and communist party rejects 
joined solidarity another testily asked whether solidarity is a 
union or a political party 
a third man asked why the candidates failed to mention the 
working class another jumped up and said the questioner was a 
local official who gained office through the party system 
later the solidarity candidates headed nine miles down the road 
to their final stop the village of sochocin 
about 150 farmers crowded into the community center to listen to 
the same speeches and pose many of the same questions as the 
farmers in ojrzen 
communist party candidates have been keeping a much lower 
profile 
most people are for solidarity said retired farmer sabina 
walczewska as she sat in a wooden cart drawn by a tractor 
everyone here says with solidarity things are going to change for 
the better maybe whether things really will be better no one 
knows 
the 73yearold woman her hands calloused from years on the 
land without modern machines said she plans to vote for solidarity

may rains have eased farmers worries 
about another drought and have lowered grain prices but consumers 
can probably still expect the biggest rise in food prices in eight 
years economists say 
its 200 percent better last year was grim says doug 
miller who farms 350 acres in st joseph county in northcentral 
indiana 
generous spring rains provided a breather from drought in the 
midwest and sent grain prices tumbling on commodity markets but 
they havent come close to replenishing parched soil deep down or 
washing out predictions for a food price increase of up to 7 
percent 
the drought of 88 reduced corn yields 30 percent nationwide and 
soybean production 20 percent then a dry winter coupled with 
dust storms and subarctic freezes devastated winter wheat 
production with 39 percent of that crop now deemed either in poor 
or very poor shape as the harvest approaches 
then came the rainy spring conditions have been so wet that 
planting has been delayed in such 1988 drought battlegrounds as 
indiana and ohio and the rain ensured that seeds that had been 
planted got the chance to germinate 
were not desperate says agronomist garren benson at iowa 
state university the pressure is off for the time being 
drought still plagues some parts of the country but with the 
rain weve had in the corn belt we know it certainly isnt going 
to be like last year says economist ralph parlett at the 
economic research service of the us department of agriculture 
the rains also have taken the edge off a droughtinspired rally 
in grain markets where prices rise when a scarce supply is 
forecast and fall with each bit of good news from the fields the 
rising dollar also has been a factor in depressing grain prices 
on the chicago board of trade contracts calling for september 
delivery of this summers crop fell 9 percent for corn and almost 
12 percent for soybeans between may 5 and friday 
at the height of the 1988 drought corn for september 1988 
delivery reached 364 a bushel on friday the september 1989 
contract closed at 242 soybeans peaked at 1070 a bushel 
nearly a year ago but wound up last week at 650 
but while the drought scare has diminished and commodity prices 
are retreating economists are not rushing to rein in forecasts of 
rising prices at supermarkets and restaurants 
the usdas economic research service recently revised upward its 
forecast for the consumer price index for food to a climb of 4 
percent to 7 percent in 1989 in november it had predicted a 3 
percent to 5 percent increase in 1989 food prices 
if inflation for food surpasses the 41 percent level of each of 
the past two years it will hit the highest mark since the 78 
percent level of 1981 
parlett says drought aftereffects from 1988 are partly to blame 
with rising costs for feed grain egg production was cut back 
pushing prices higher processed vegetable supplies also are tight 
because of the drought 
the droughts lingering effects on pastures in cattle country 
also are taking their toll on food prices by boosting feed costs 
and forcing ranchers and farmers to reduce herds the 995 million 
head of cattle in the united states as the year began was the 
lowest since 1961 
to help beef producers the agriculture department on friday 
announced steps to make some erosionprone land available for 
grazing and hay cutting 
factors unrelated to the drought that are contributing to higher 
food prices include strong consumer demand and rising energy costs 
which increase processing and transportation expenses 
sung won song chief economist at the norwest corp in 
minneapolis said may rains have not changed his inflation outlook 
the drought outlook for this year is yet to be seen song 
said 
many regions are still powder dry below the top inches of soil 
he noted subsoil moisture is rated inadequate in at least 80 
percent of kansas and the dakotas more than 90 percent of northern 
missouri and virtually all of iowa and nebraska 
for corn and soybeans june is a crucial month because it 
normally is one of the wettest times of the growing season a dry 
june spells trouble in july and august when such row crops are 
developing quickly and need plenty of moisture 
we had a lot of rain in the spring now its so dry i keep 
planting hoping its going to rain said former major league 
pitcher jim catfish hunter now a soybean farmer at hertford 
nc we dont need 4 or 5 inches we just need a little bit 
and in kansas rains were too little and too late to save much 
of the winter wheat crop central north central and northeast 
parts of the state still are plagued with drought 
a lot of people are thinking the drought is over says jack 
may meteorologist in charge of the topeka office of the national 
weather service in may we had normal precipitation and one 
month of normal precipitation does not a drought break

the fbi is sending an agent to the site of the 
august plane crash that killed pakistani president mohammad zia 
ulhaq and us ambassador arnold raphel an agency official 
confirmed 
the agent will be sent within a week nearly 10 months after the 
fbi was initially shut out of the investigation said oliver b 
revell executive assistant director for investigations 
the aim will be to seek evidence at the site where the plane 
went down aug 17 killing the two officials and 27 others 
including brig gen herbert m wassom the chief us defense 
representative to pakistan 
pakistans official report on the crash has been under review by 
the fbi since october it concludes that sabotage was the cause but 
does not pinpoint those responsible 
revell said the fbi has completed its review of the report 
we have conducted all of our interviews of us participants 
and witnesses and we are dispatching an agent to go onscene to 
conduct an onscene evaluation and we will go from there he said 
he said the decision to keep the fbi out of the investigation 
appears to have come from within the national security council 
the pakistanis as we understand would have agreed for us to be 
there but it was never presented to them he said 
i personally believe that this was a very unique situation a 
very sensitive location with a us ally teetering on the brink 
revell said people who did not know the requirements of the 
antiterrorism law made a decision without understanding the 
ramifications of the decision 
in more recent terrorist incidents there has been cooperation 
between the state department and the fbi he said 
rep bill hughes dnj has been critical of the fbis 
exclusion from the investigation saying it is the only agency with 
the expertise to determine whether zia and raphel were victims of 
terrorism 
pakistan is one of the key diplomatic posts said hughes 
everybody said right away we couldnt rule out sabotage a proper 
criminal investigation was not carried out whether for national 
security reasons a turf battle an understanding with the 
pakistanis or an absolute blunder 
hughes had known raphel a native of atlantic city nj and 
highly respected member of the diplomatic corps 
i met arnold before he went to pakistan hughes said he 
was probably one of the rising stars 
hughes crime subcommittee has been trying to determine why the 
state department on aug 21 at first granted and then denied the 
federal bureau of investigation permission to investigate the crash 
its not the first time ive seen potential criminal 
investigations thwarted hughes said its obvious somebody 
bungled the job 
in this instance nobody brought in any criminal 
investigators no forensics experts no autopsies were done on the 
pilots he said they did find foreign substances on the plane 
components suitable for a mediumsize incendiary device which are 
not explained away

when 12000 people gather sunday for the biggest 
aids conference ever they will hear grim reports on the social and 
economic toll of the epidemic but little encouragement about the 
medical race to stop it 
the fifth international conference on aids is a gathering of all 
of the bigname researchers and physicians as well as their 
supporting casts who this decade have made aids a profession and 
livelihood as well as a tragedy 
the obvious and easy discoveries have been made so the product 
of the conference will be thousands of updates on the painstakingly 
tiny steps necessary for science to learn to thwart the aids virus 
and repair its destruction 
no clearly superior successor to azt the only approved aids 
drug is expected to emerge from the 4500 planned presentations 
nor is there likely to be an effective vaccine to protect people 
from catching hiv the aids virus 
i am not expecting any big announcements out of this 
conference unfortunately in terms of new drugs capable of making 
a real difference over the next two years said dr mark wainberg 
of mcgill university i think we will see a lot of leads for the 
future but i dont think it likely we will have major cures or 
vaccines announced 
in 1985 3200 people gathered in atlanta for the first big aids 
meeting at the time 9000 cases of aids had been reported in the 
united states expected at the montreal meeting which runs through 
friday are 10000 aids experts 1000 reporters and 1000 
exhibitors the total of us aids cases is nearing 100000 
with the growing numbers has come a realization that acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome is far more than a medical problem 
although 65 percent of the presentations will concern the 
biological and medical intricacies of aids this years conference 
is the first to put a major emphasis on other aspects of the 
epidemic including its psychological impact costs ethical 
dilemmas education and legal questions 
we encourage this marrying of disciplines said dr alastair 
j clayton director general of the federal center for aids in 
ottawa we are trying in this conference to keep the behavioral 
and biomedical sciences working together we all want to control 
the spread of hiv infection in our society and use every means we 
can 
among other things the meeting will hold sessions on aids 
legislation around the world the hospital costs of the disease 
the role of churches how companies deal with the disease whether 
hivinfected people should be allowed to adopt children and 
whether such peoples infections should be kept confidential if 
they are sexually irresponsible 
ivan head the conference chairman said the decision to open 
the gathering to nonmedical subjects was made even before last 
years annual meeting in stockholm sweden at the urging of its 
cosponsor the world health organization 
there was a recognition that at the present pace of scientific 
research there is likely to be considerable delay until we can 
come to terms with the virus in a scientific fashion said head 
who is chairman of canadas international development research 
center in the interim we have to recognize these societal 
concerns 
however some researchers are uneasy about the vast scope of the 
meeting and the blurring of its focus on science 
wainberg who is coordinating the meetings research 
presentations said that scientists undoubtedly will learn more 
about the ethics and economics of aids and its impact on third 
world countries 
but he added i am afraid we may reach the conclusion that we 
tried to do too much this meeting has tried to be all things to 
all people there is a part of me that feels uneasy about it but 
well see 
dr richard morisset of montreals hoteldieu hospital the 
program chairman agreed this is a familiar complaint but he 
added there will be more papers and posters in biomedicine than 
at any other meeting i think the criticism is unimportant

the soviet people have long thrived on 
socalled black humor biting satire that make light of some of the 
more onerous aspects of a life characterized by shortages and 
corruption 
now the editors of the leading soviet humor magazine 
krokodil have published an englishlanguage collection of 
satirical cartoons the magazines editor aleksey pyanov says he 
hopes will help destroy the myth that soviet people are gloomy 
withdrawn and stern 
the weekly krokodil reaches an enormous audience in the 
soviet union with a circulation of 53 million by comparison 
time has a circulation in the united sates of 47 million and 
newsweek 33 million 
the wideranging collection of 185 cartoons from krokodil 
covering topics from marital humor to environmental problems is 
being made available to american readers in the book soviet 
humor 
the most poignant sketches ones that may surprise western 
readers are those depicting social problems such as alcoholism or 
prostitution the housing shortage lethargic bureaucrats and 
workers 
all are topics that krokodil embraced satirically before it 
was politically safe to tackle them directly in official soviet 
newspapers 
several selections reflect the terror of stalinism when a 
midnight knock at the door could mean a oneway ticket to siberia 
in one a wife consoles her husband that a noise from the next room 
is not the police its just burglars 
in another three road workers idle beneath a sign alerting 
motorists to beware of roadwork in the final frame the laborer 
depicted in the sign climbs down and bends his back to work to the 
amazement of the idlers 
americans with memories of a bad restaurant meal might identify 
with the krokodil cartoon of a slovenly chef handing a plate to 
a waitress with the comment palm this off on somebody i am 
afraid to taste it 
another cartoon helps explain shortages in soviet restaurants 
as the manager leaves loaded down with fish ham and other 
goodies the chef calls to the waitress klava the boss has left 
for the day take all the meat and fish items off the menu 
a number of cartoons are more tragic than funny a woman walks 
down the street carrying groceries in one hand and leading a child 
with the other the childs far hand is raised grasping a shadow 
of a man who with his other hand clutches a halfempty bottle of 
vodka

a woman who plucked out a teenagers 
eye during an exorcism wont have to go to jail after all says the 
judge who sentenced her last year to a sixmonth term 
district judge mike mcdonald ordered andrea cowan who was 
convicted in june 1988 of cruelty to a juvenile to buy an 850 
artificial eye for the boy 
mrs cowan was pregnant when mcdonald sentenced her in october 
1988 and he said she would not have to go to jail until after she 
gave birth 
in the meantime mcdonald said friday the prosecutor urged him 
not to send mrs cowan to jail she has expressed remorse and her 
probation officer describes her as an ideal candidate for 
probation the judge said 
mrs cowan could have been sentenced to 10 years in prison on 
the cruelty charge 
mcdonald said he originally ordered mrs cowan to serve jail 
time as well as doing 300 hours of community service and paying 
nearly 4000 in restitution to punish her for committing a crime 
in the name of christianity 
in this day of the various scandals which have been widely 
publicized the last thing the christian cause needs is this type 
of additional adverse publicity mcdonald said at the time

chinese troops fired on protesters and smashed 
through barricades with tanks to reach tiananmen square early 
sunday at least 13 people were reported killed and scores injured 
a doctor at a small hospital near where the clashes occurred 
said about 100 people were treated for injuries and that 12 had 
died a soldier was killed in another part of the city when he was 
run over by a tank racing to the square 
thousands of troops armed with rifles marched up the east side 
of the vast square which has been occupied by prodemocracy 
protesters for three weeks until saturday the tense standoff had 
been generally peaceful even though the students were repeatedly 
ordered to leave the square and end the protest 
students threw bottles and other objects at soldiers who 
advanced saturday night while troops beat those who obstructed 
their path with sticks 
another group of more than 1000 troops gained a foothold on the 
southwest corner of the vast square while throngs of students and 
supporters tried to block their movement 
a tank pulled up next to the great hall of the people on the 
western side of the square but it was besieged by crowds pelting 
it with rocks 
another tank roared down changan avenue the main street from 
the east followed by thousands of shouting people on bicycles 
other tanks crashed through barricades in the west 
the street where the gunfire took place was speckled with blood 
crowds broke up the pavement to throw stones at the troops and set 
one military bus on fire 
late saturday a convoy of at least 40 trucks with several 
thousand troops broke through the barricades set up by people and 
began moving slowly down changan avenue toward the square 
shortly after 1 am sunday noon edt saturday troops broke 
through a flaming barricade at the xidan intersection about one 
mile west of the square 
a man at the intersection about a mile west of the square 
received a gunshot wound in the chest as truckloads of troops 
rammed through barricades set up by citizens a medical student on 
the scene said the mans heart had stopped beating and there was 
little hope for his survival 
about 6000 people trying to block the path of the troops were 
beaten by riot police and troops and attacked with tear gas 
citizens had set fire to public buses parked across the road but 
the army trucks slammed through 
at least five people were taken away after being hit by the fire 
in the initial incident more than a dozen others were bleeding 
from wounds suffered when troops beat people in the crowd 
one 28yearold worker hit by a bullet in the leg said the 
government is fascist how can they do this to me how can they do 
this to the people 
the attack on protesters first began about 8 pm saturday when 
thousands of beijing citizens trying to push the troops back began 
hurling stones police retaliated by attacking people with 
truncheons and electric cattle prods firing tear gas and finally 
opening fire 
about 5000 troops made a dash for the square from the east 
earlier in the evening but they were turned back and headed up a 
side street 
one student speaking in a cracked voice over a loudspeaker on 
the square urged students not to leave and said we chinese will 
persist to the end if we die at tiananmen square then so be it 
about 200000 people were gathered on the square to protect the 
thousands of students who have staged a prodemocracy sitin there 
since may 13 
the prodemocracy protests began on april 15 with a simple call 
by students for talks on increasing social freedoms and ending 
official corruption they peaked during the week of may 15 when 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev visited the country and up to 
1 million poured into the streets 
the government declared martial law on may 20 and troops 
attempted to advance on the square but they were driven back by 
masses of average citizens sympathetic to the protesters 
the protest led to a power struggle in the government with 
hardliners such as senior leader deng xiaoping and premier li peng 
apparently winning control 
the shooting saturday night came after an earlier attempt to 
quell the protests failed earlier in the day hundreds of police 
had fired tear gas on crowds for the first time in seven weeks of 
prodemocracy protests 
witnesses said riot troops beat at least 30 people east of 
tiananmen square but hundreds of thousands of people took to the 
streets to protect the students 
a detachment of 5000 troops surrounded by taunting crowds one 
block off the square began hitting people with belts during the 
short fracas people burst into tears and the crowd shouted you 
cant hit the people 
security forces made predawn and afternoon advances on the 
square but failed to dislodge the students who have occupied the

eighteen years after authorities say john 
e list methodically shot his family to death people here see an 
end to the tale that has haunted this quiet wealthy suburb 
the former sunday school teacher was arrested in richmond va 
last thursday where he had been living with a second wife of four 
years and working as an accountant 
nearly two decades of leadchasing in every state europe and 
south america were terminated by a simple anonymous tip following a 
broadcast of the case on the television show americas most 
wanted 
police chief anthony scutti said the murders left a black mark 
on the town of 32000 25 miles from new york city the arrest 
helped fade that mark 
if they had a giant microphone in town you would have heard a 
giant sigh of relief scutti said when the chief went to an 
awards dinner the night of the arrest he was greeted with a 
spontaneous standing ovation 
i think that reflected the feeling of all of us he said 
on dec 7 1971 police who had been alerted by worried 
neighbors found the bodies of lists wife and three children lying 
on sleeping bags on the ballroom floor of the familys 18room 
mansion cloths covered the faces of helen 45 patricia 16 john 
jr 15 and frederick 13 the body of lists 85yearold mother 
alma was found in an upstairs closet 
all five had been shot in the head they apparently had been 
dead nearly a month list who had held jobs as an accountant and 
insurance salesman and was apparently beset by financial and family 
problems had vanished 
in many ways the list case worked its way into the towns 
consciousness teenagers seeking excitement would cruise by the 
house until it mysteriously burned down a year after the deaths 
almost every year newspapers would run articles on the crimes 
anniversary 
and people remembered 
scutti then a sergeant recalled bringing patricia list to the 
stationhouse late one night several months before her death she 
had slipped out the window and was going to meet a friend 
lo and behold he comes in at 230 in the morning dressed in a 
business suit to pick up his daughter scutti said list scutti 
said sometimes dressed the same way to mow his lawn 
claudia haller remembered being interviewed by list for a 
teaching job at the primary school connected with the redeemer 
lutheran church 
the redbrick slateroofed church where list taught sunday 
school was just about the only community tie he had church was a 
constant he used pastors as references for jobs and a gun permit 
three weeks before the crime list met his second wife at a denver 
church function in 1977 authorities said i felt that he was a 
very intellectual man he was just very calm and collected you 
could see he was a very religious man too mrs haller said he 
was also a private man given to eating lunch alone at work said 
westfield detective lt bernard tracy 
now that one mystery lists whereabouts has been solved 
another remains why 
list left letters as yet undisclosed to his pastor and others 
explaining his actions list reportedly believed his family was 
falling away from their religion and had to be killed for their own 
good 
a newspaper at the time included quotations from brenda taylor 
helen lists daughter by a previous husband who had died in the 
korean war miss taylor said the marriage with list was filled with 
tension because her mother was psychologically unstable and had a 
drinking problem 
lists lutheran pastor in rochester ny during the early 
1960s said more tension was created by mrs lists comparison of 
the meek list with her first husband a strong military man 
toward the end mrs list was bedridden for months and lists 
financial problems were mounting he was upset with his daughters 
desire to become an actress and attachment to a young man 
considered in the wrong crowd said james moran police chief 
at the time 
the young man for several years left flowers at the familys 
grave in fairview cemetery where a single headstone records lists 
wife and children 
i hope it ends for him more than it does for us said mark 
pletscher of fanwood who was two years behind john jr in school 
i hope he comes to grips with this whole thing

iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini recovering from surgery for bleeding in his digestive 
system has developed a complication tehran radio reported 
saturday 
the radio gave no details of the deterioration in the 
86yearold spiritual leaders condition but urged the nation to 
pray for his recovery 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia contained a statement from 
khomeinis office that said 
at 300 pm 730 am edt on saturday a complication arose 
in the imams condition which the doctors are trying to control 
we urge the nation to pray for the imams health and hope that 
their prayers will be answered 
the deterioration in khomeinis condition followed reports over 
the past five days that he was making a normal recovery 
khomeini underwent surgery 11 days ago to control intestinal 
bleeding 
a few days after the operation tehran television also 
monitored in nicosia said a slight cardiac complication had 
arisen but that it had been relieved the next day 
khomeini is referred to by iranians as the imam or spiritual 
leader 
on thursday khomeini was allowed out of bed in a tehran 
hospital and visited with friends and relatives outside the 
building the television said it showed film of the revolutionary 
patriarch sitting outside performing his prayers the report quoted 
doctors as saying khomeinis condition was very satisfactory 
and that he was expected to make a complete recovery 
irans main opposition group the mujahedeen khalq or peoples 
holy warriors said in a statement earlier this week that khomeini 
suffered a heart attack last saturday the statement said the heart 
attack came five days after he underwent surgery on the duodenum 
part of the small intestine close to the stomach the mujahedeens 
claim could not be independently confirmed 
khomeini reportedly has been ailing since he had a heart attack 
in 1986 
since then he has rarely been seen outside his home in the north 
tehran suburb of jamaran 
khomeini the son of a religious leader from a village southwest 
of tehran taught for years at qom the center of shiite teaching 
in iran 
he attracted attention for his independentmindedness and stern 
moral example and soon became a focus for opposition to the 
monarchy in iran 
he was sent into exile in november 1964 first to turkey then 
to iraq where he settled in the shiite shrine city of najaf he 
later moved to france 
khomeini emerged in 1978 as the moral leader of a burgeoning 
revolution against the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi that was 
organized through irans shiite clergymen and their followers 
he returned to tehran in february 1979 after the shah fled the 
country and became the supreme head of irans islamic revolution 
for life 
khomeini developed into a skilled politician balancing the 
different iranian factions against each other but never losing his 
power as leader of the theocratic state 
when irans eight year war with iraq ended in a unsponsored 
ceasefire in august there was speculation khomeini would back 
more moderate members of the iranian regime in their efforts to 
rebuild the warravaged country 
but his radicalism reemerged in february with a purge of those 
members of the hierarchy and a call for the death of british author 
salman rushdie for his irreverant portrayal of islam in his novel 
the satanic verses

on west beirut since the arab league called the may 11 ceasefire 
but the spokesman warned we wont remain idle if the 
ceasefire violations persist

determine who fired on the moslem sector but moslemrun voice of 
the nation radio blamed aouns army

north of beirut the presidential palace and nearby districts 
in west beirut shells exploded along the seaside raouche

we will have to fire back he added 
king hassan ii of morocco will host the talks with king fahd of 
saudi arabia and algerian president chadli bendjedid an arab 
league summit gave the three men six months to stabilize the may 11 
truce and find a political settlement to lebanons 14year civil 
war 
the daily annahar newspaper said the three plan to set up an 
office in beirut 
it said their foreign ministers will hold talks in baghdad

liberation to drive out of lebanon some 40000 syrian troops

the soviet union on saturday accused britain of 
bugging its trade delegation building in london and the apartments 
of soviet diplomats 
the foreign office denied the allegation which further strained 
relations between the countries 
two weeks ago britain accused eight soviet diplomats and three 
journalists of spying and expelled them the soviet union responded 
with identical charges and expulsions 
soviet diplomats said at a news conference at their embassy on 
saturday that construction work on the trade delegation building 
revealed that it was honeycombed with bugging devices planted 
in the concrete walls and even deep underground 
soviet ambassador leonid zamyatin went to the foreign office in 
the afternoon to deliver a vigorous protest the diplomats said 
the soviets claimed the electronic devices were so powerful that 
they would harm the health of soviet citizens and britons living 
nearby he did not explain how 
first secretary alexander smaguin said some of the alleged bugs 
were discovered very recently 
they were discovered during maintenance and repair work 
carried out over some period of time by soviet construction 
workers he said 
obviously these devices could only be installed during the 
contruction of the building about 15 years ago said nickolai 
kossov another first secretary 
the soviets displayed photographs of the alleged eavesdropping 
devices graphics of where they were found and examples of the 
devices themselves 
reporters and photographers later were taken by bus to one of 
the diplomats flats where the devices were allegedly found 
a statement issued by soviet counselor gregory karasin said 
facts show that in great britain there remain active forces keen 
on bringing our relations back to the times of the cold war 
reanimating the enemy image of the soviet union 
he said the surveillance amounted to rude intrusion in private 
lives of soviet citizens working in britain 
by expert opinion the mode of operation of many of the 
discovered devices involved the use of highpowered directional 
radio emissions damaging to the health of both soviet personnel and 
british people living locally karasin said 
after zamyatins 10minute meeting with sir patrick wright 
permanent secretary at the foreign office the department issued a 
statement that said wright was certain the british government had 
nothing to do with any bugging devices found on soviet property 
devices of this sort are widely available both in this country 
and indeed in moscow the statement said

oxford graduates in their black academic 
robes gathered among the universitys ancient spires on saturday 
and elected irish poet seamus heaney to the prestigious post of 
professor of poetry 
heaney an awardwinning poet and favorite of the universitys 
arts establishment was born in northern ireland and lives in 
dublin and the united states where he is a professor at harvard 
university he is 50 
none of the poets was present when the announcement was made 
outside the universitys divinity school 
heaney who won 316 of the 485 total votes cast thursday and 
saturday had always been heavily favored for the professorship 
one of the universitys least arduous posts it requires three 
lectures for each of its five years 
heaney could not be reached for comment telephone calls to his 
office in boston went unanswered and his home telephone number was 
not listed 
the highly regarded and popular poet was nominated by oxford 
novelist dame iris murdoch by three previous holders of the 
professorship and by oxfords most influential english literature 
specialists 
in addition to his poetry heaney has published books of 
literary criticsm and has long experience teaching a member of the 
irish academy of letters he became boylston professor of rhetoric 
and oratory at harvard in cambridge massachusetts in 1985 
competition for the professorship though dignified has been 
intense 
charles h sisson a 75yearold poet author and translator was 
a notable contender and garnered 96 votes 
an attentiongetting outsider was 30yearold rastafarian reggae 
poet benjamin zephaniah who was a candidate for the post of writer 
in residence at cambridge universitys trinity college in 1986 and 
only narrowly missed 
he had the backing of younger graduates but as columnist andrew 
brown wrote in the independent newspaper dialect is notoriously 
difficult to transliterate in english so his work looks no 
more than silly on paper but that is not how he is to be judged 
he is said to be very impressive in live performance brown 
added 
zephaniah won 60 votes 
he was followed by duncan mccann with nine votes mccann lost 
to current professor peter levi five years ago 
mccann was so indignant at being referred to as the barroom 
poet because of his nomination by friends from the kings arms in 
oxford that some papers took to calling him not the barroom 
poet 
in addition to the three lectures the poetry professor gives 
each year he must judge three english poetry and essay 
competitions for students and give a public oration every other 
year 
from the establishment of the professorship in 1708 until 1972 
the oration had to be delivered in latin a task which alone might 
merit the professors annual stipend of 4960 
but in 1972 roy fuller got away with delivering his in english 
and successors have followed suit levi delivered his last oration 
in verse 
previous sitters in the illustrious poetry chair have included 
wh auden robert graves and edmund blunden

a mahogany desk and bookcase made in the 1760s 
sold at auction saturday for 121 million setting a world record 
for a piece of furniture christies auction house said 
the chippendale secretary was bought by harold sack a new york 
dealer after a threeway bidding contest that lasted about a 
minute said dana micucci a spokeswoman for christies 
it was a very dynamic event people rushed up to sack and 
basically the sale stopped while they applauded him she said 
the desk made for nicholas brown of rhode island is attributed 
to john goddard a renowned cabinetmaker from newport ri nine 
known goddard sixshell secretaries are known to exist 
the desk soars to a dramatic 113 inches the upper section is 
divided into three blocked cupboard doors each carved with a 
shell the lower case has a slant lid blocked and carved with three 
shells 
this particular piece is probably the consummate example of 
18th century american furniture said dean failey head of 
christies american decorative arts department it is perhaps 
americas finest contribution in the history of furniture making 
the auction house had predicted that the desk would sell for 3 
million to 5 million the 121 million includes christies 10 
percent commission 
the previous record for a piece of furniture was held by marie 
antoinettes console table which sold for 297 million last 
november in london the 121 million is the highest price paid for 
any art object other than a painting according to the auction 
house 
goddard made the desk for brown and his wife whom he married in 
1762 brown family correspondence indicates the family made its 
fortune in shipping and commerce in providence ri 
the desk remained in the brown family until december 1988 when 
a descendant and namesake of the original owner retired capt 
nicholas brown of baltimore donated it to the john nicholas brown 
center for the study of american civilization in providence 
the center sold the piece of furniture because it needed funds 
to repair its headquarters the nightingalebrown house where the 
family lived until 1983 said robert p emlen executive director 
of the center

four years after he was ousted in a palace 
coup sudans former president gaafar nimeiri spends his time in 
large slightly decrepit villa plotting to seize power again 
he has aged visibly and put on weight during the years as a 
political outcast in cairo the villa and the guards patrolling it 
with automatic weapons are courtesy of the egyptian government 
which granted nimeiri political asylum after he was stranded in 
cairo by his defense ministers coup 
nimeiri had just returned from an aidseeking visit to 
washington on april 6 1985 when gen abdulrahman swareddahab 
sided with civil disobedience campaigners to oust him 
nimeiri had been in power 16 years 
during a rare interview friday the former strongman wore a 
white suit instead of the military uniform or traditional flowing 
white robes he favored as president of africas largest country 
he spoke of his anger at his defense ministers betrayal his 
life as an exile the government of thieves ruling his country 
and his advice to sudanese supporters take over the power 
the 59yearold nimeiri said he socializes mostly with sudanese 
who live in egypt or visit cairo and has little contact with his 
egyptian benefactors other than requesting renovations for the 
villa 
his kinky hair has turned almost totally white behind his 
receding hairline his waistline has expanded into a pot belly 
nimeiri claimed overwhelming support in sudan and urged his 
countrymen to overthrow prime minister sadek mahdi elected in 1986 
in balloting overseen by swareddahabs transitional military 
government 
i have felt hurt by the news i get from sudan and about the 
suffering of the sudanese people nimeiri said 
those who were deceived now call for the regime of gaafar 
nimeiri i have received numerous letters and people all 
asking me to save sudan after it has fallen in a deep abyss as they 
put it 
sudan was near bankruptcy when nimeiri was overthrown and 
little has changed experts blame a succession of weak coalitions 
reticence to undertake reforms and work decisively to end a civil 
war that began in 1983 
sudanese appear disillusioned by mahdis lack of progress and 
some have been heard to speak wistfully of the nimeiri era but 
there is no visible support for the ousted president on the streets 
nimeiri insisted in the interview that the sudan he ruled was 
among the worlds most democratic and prosperous countries but in 
1985 thousands of sudanese danced in the streets after 
demonstrations against high prices islamic law and nimeiris 
ironfisted security policies led to the coup 
similar demonstrations have rocked the country this year and 
under pressure from the military mahdi was forced to form a 
broaderbased coalition and prepare to negotiate with the rebels 
mahdis government has convicted several members of nimeiris 
military regime for corruption and has a standing request that 
egypt return the field marshal for trial president hosni mubarak 
has refused invoking egypts long tradition of providing political 
asylum 
nimeiris presence in cairo has strained egypts relations with 
its southern neighbor 
twice the former leader has broken his hosts ban on political 
activity in 1985 he sent recorded messages to sudan urging people 
to restore his power 
this year he has given a handful of interviews and admitted 
sending tapes and written speeches to sudan to mark the 20th 
anniversary of his seizure of power 
nimeiri said cairo has expressed displeasure but the pressure 
on me from the sudanese people does not allow me to keep my word to 
the egyptian government 
i am not urging the people to overthrow the government i am 
urging them to take over the power

the soviet union convened a fulltime legislature 
saturday after eight days of raucous parliamentary debate which 
president mikhail s gorbachev said showed how his reforms activate 
people 
at its first session the 271member soviet of the union one of 
two chambers of the supreme soviet legislature chose economist 
yevgeny m primakov as chairman and proposed creating four 
commissions and 14 committees including one to oversee the kgb 
secret police 
primakov said the committees are modeled in part on the us 
congress 
the meeting broadcast to the nation brought the soviet union 
into the second phase of its adventure in democracy the larger 
congress of peoples deputies the parliament adjourned until 
monday after boisterous debate that brought up a catalogue of 
problems with gorbachevs perestroika or restructuring of soviet 
economy and society 
during the days of the congress work i became sure that 
perestroika changes people fast the 58yearold soviet leader 
told legislators saturday he said the 2250 deputies most elected 
in competitive balloting for the first time in 70 years are 
wonderful people different people dissimilar people very 
interested in things starting to change in the country for the 
better 
how these perestroika processes bring out crystallize these 
new cadres he said 
the soviet of the union met for just one day the other chamber 
the soviet of nationalities meets monday and a joint session is 
scheduled tuesday to consider the communist partys nomination of 
politburo member nikolai i ryzhkov to continue as premier 
the two chambers replace a larger parliament that automatically 
approved government decisions 
primakov urged the new supreme soviet to exercise real control 
over executive organs 
vice president anatoly i lukyanov said the committee on defense 
and state security which will oversee the kgb will meet less 
frequently and have fewer members than others 
roy a medvedev a legislator and historian who has written 
extensively about dictator josef stalins secret police and mass 
terror said the committee can demand explanations of any kgb 
official and recommend changing kgb decisions but he said it was 
too soon to tell if it can exercise true control over the secretive 
agency 
everything depends on its composition if it is made up of 
people who are not independent who are timid people people 
who dont have enough will or intellectual abilities then of 
course it will be a committee that cant completely carry out its 
functions medvedev said in an interview 
kgb chairman vladimir a kryuchkov said thursday he supports 
legislative authority over his agency 
some parliamentarians have expressed concern that few 
progressiveminded people have been elected to the supreme soviet 
saturdays session was much tamer than the congress but dissent 
was evident 
marju lauristin from the grassroots peoples front of estonia 
joined two lithuanians in abstaining in the primakov vote because 
she said he did not reject description of the soviet union as an 
empire or power baltic activists want a degree of sovereignty for 
the 15 soviet republics 
there were no votes against primakov he was the only candidate

hundreds of people turned out to labor 
with shovels and bare hands for their moment of fame as builders 
of the worlds longest sand sculpture 
after crews worked much of the day under a hot june sun a 
surveying company certified friday that the sand castle measured 
15063 feet giving the crew a good shot at getting into the next 
guinness book of world records 
the centerpiece of the project a 15foothigh castle with the 
logos of corporate sponsors had been built earlier in the week by 
two leading sand sculptors todd vanderpluym and mark altamar 
then volunteers made two long long wings on the building friday 
following guide lines painted on the beach and taking care to 
sculpt the sand and not just pile it up 
festival chairman mary snipesphillips said the surveyors 
findings along with videotape photographs and volunteers 
signatures will be sent to the guinness book of world records 
the castle would appear to easily beat the 10760footlong sand 
millipede built along south padre beach texas in march 1987 
which is listed in the 1989 guinness book 
estimates of the number of folks manning the shovel brigades or 
otherwise helping on the project ranged up to 2000 
its tough but i think well make it said one volunteer 
richard lamb 
the castle was called the neverending fantasy and included 
sculptings of a jet plane a jungle lagoon golf course a shark 
and a castle turret topped with a tiny cocktail umbrella 
the project was part of the citys sixday sun fun festival 
which opened on friday by saturday much of the castle remained 
but the tide had already begun to wash away parts of it

on a lava field where christianity was 
proclaimed in iceland nearly a thousand years ago pope john paul 
ii appealed saturday for christian unity and primacy of moral 
values 
the pope focused on the weakening of family life and 
reconciliation among christians in this country where 2300 of the 
244000 people are roman catholic and where more people play than 
worship on sundays 
iceland was the second stop on the popes fivenation visit to 
scandinavia a lutheran stronghold where the 16th century protesant 
reformation swept away catholicism and the current affluent

new prime minister sousuke uno promises to reform 
the scandaltainted government but he faces the task of fixing a 
factious political system that not only helped cause his countrys 
crisis but also put him in power 
soon after uno was chosen by the governing liberal democrats to 
replace outgoing prime minister noboru takeshita as party 
president the former foreign minister promised to carry forward 
political reforms with all my loyalty and strength 
he said the reforms include abolishing the liberal democrats 
rival factions which create formidable power blocs but force 
leaders to raise huge sums of money to support their followers 
political activities 
that need for money is believed to have led the party leadership 
into seeking the quick profits and large donations offered by 
companies such as recruit co the publishing conglomerate sold 
stock at cutrate prices to politicians and bureaucrats it hoped to 
influence they made handsome profits after the stock went public 
and the scandal forced takeshita out of office 
i agree with those who say these are not times to be forever 
building factions uno told reporters friday but analysts say 
that exorcizing the party of its blocs would be a monumental task 
and perhaps an impossible one for uno the first president in the 
34year history of the liberal democratic party to have no faction 
of his own to fall back on 
nearly all legislators from the party are divided into six major 
factions the largest headed by takeshita that have typically 
been allotted power in the party and cabinet roughly equal to their 
number of seats in parliament faction loyalty usually decides how 
individual lawmakers will vote on important issues 
leading the second and thirdstrongest factions are outgoing 
party secretary general shintaro abe and former finance minister 
kiichi miyazawa who have both been implicated in the recruit 
scandal 
though uno stressed that he did not ask each faction to submit a 
wish list for posts in his cabinet an accepted party practice 
the factional balance of power clearly figured in his appointments 
joining uno at the helm of the governing party are keijiro 
murata of the abe faction kiyoshi mizuno of the miyazawa 
faction and ryutaro hashimoto of the takeshita faction 
the new 21member cabinet including uno has six members from 
takeshitas faction five from miyazawas four each from abes and 
former prime minister yasuhiro nakasones and one each from smaller 
factions 
uno resigned from the faction that was until wednesday headed by 
nakasone whose 198287 tenure covered the period when the recruit 
scandal developed deeply embroiled in the affair nakasone has 
given up leadership of his faction the liberal democrats fourth 
largest and resigned from the party 
the faction is expected to remain intact under new leadership 
concern remains over whether uno will be independent of 
takeshita and nakasone who will retain his seat in the lower house 
he will be a takeshita puppet because that is where he will 
get his support said political analyst and author asao 
yamaguchi yamaguchi said that without a faction of his own uno 
has no clear power base and will be forced to rely heavily on those 
who do 
there has been no change at all in the basics or the liberal 
democrats attitude yamaguchi said the party is now and 
always will be a coalition of factions they like it that way 
to end a rift in 1987 nakasone handpicked takeshita as his 
successor and it was widely believed that takeshita in turn 
promised to pass the reins on to abe his close friend abe too 
tainted by recruit money to replace takeshita now reportedly hopes 
to succeed uno when the recruit dust settles 
at a news conference on saturday uno denied his government was 
only an interim one it is not an interim cabinet and i can tell 
you that it will be a cabinet which will be highly appraised he 
said 
the most pressing task for uno will be to reverse low public 
approval ratings for his party before next months elections for 
the upper house of parliament the liberal democrats have 
controlled both houses of parliament since 1955 but political 
observers say the party could lose its hold on government as a 
result of the recruit scandal 
of the 17 politicians or aides involved in purchases of cutrate 
stock offered by recruit 13 were liberal democrats

moslem guerrillas killed five people 
and wounded six in a rocket attack on kabul on saturday and 100 
more people were killed in fighting in the cities of jalalabad and 
kandahar the government said 
it urged prime ministr benazir bhutto of pakistan to use her 
trip to washington this week to persuade the united states to cut 
off arms supplies to the guerrillas and help negotiate an end to 
the 11yearold afghan war 
the attack on kabul started early saturday with one rocket 
hitting near a kindergarten then continued through the night in 
one of the most intense attacks in more than a month 
military observers said the rockets were fired from the 
surrounding hills and appeared to be within close range but they 
could not give the distance the armed forces responded by firing 
artillery and machine guns into the hills the 12 rockets that fell 
saturday raised to 23 the number that have hit kabul since 
thursday the foreign ministry said twelve people were killed and 
13 wounded in the earlier attacks ministry spokesman mohammad nabi 
amani said 
he said fighting between the guerrillas and forces of the 
sovietbacked government occurred in the besieged eastern city of 
jalalabad and the southern city of kandahar and that at least 100 
people died and 36 were injured 
the report could not be independently verified 
before saturday the insurgents who are based in pakistan had 
said an attack on kabul was imminent but amni scoffed at their 
claims saying the fractious resistance was incapable of mounting a 
real offensive on the city 
some time ago they said they would carry out an extensive 
attack on kabul but they have been unable to carry this out a 
rocket fired from 25 miles away cannot be considerd an attack he 
said 
the guerrillas rockets with a range of 1535 miles are 
generally fired by remote control from the mountains that ring the 
city they often land in residential areas rather than hitting 
military or government intallations 
amani said four civilians were killed and six wounded in 
jalalabad a city 75 miles east of kabul that has been under a 
guerrilla siege march 7 afghan soldiers killed 72 guerrillas and 
injured 21 in an operation to clear the insurgents from the city 
and the areas near the airport amani said 
in the southern city of kandahar once afghanistans 
secondlargest city one civlian was killed and two injured by 
rockets he said government troops retaliated by attacking rebel 
positions 20 miles from the city and killing 23 guerrillas and 
wounding seven he said 
elsewhere five rockets slammed into the southern garrison town 
of khost amani said but there were no casualties 
amani urged the bush administration to reconsider its policy 
toward afghanistan and cut off the flow of weapons to the 
guerrillas 
the afghan government hopes a policy change will be made 
during ms bhuttos visit to united states this week he said 
ms bhutto has called for a political settlement to the afghan 
war but also has said peace talks should not include members of the 
ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
president najib recently has stepped up his call for peace talks 
and offered to negtotiate with the opposition and its western 
backers without conditions 
why does the united states not help restore peace instead of 
supplying more arms to the enemy amani said is a country that 
calls itself an advocate of human rights to act like this we 
consider this irresponsible 
the united states has said it will continue to supply weapons to 
the guerrillas as long as the soviet union continues to aid najibs 
government

nancy reagan reported saturday that life after 
the white house has its drawbacks 
in the white house when you needed a plumber you could 
always get one in private life you have to wait a little 
longer mrs reagan observed with a rueful smile 
the former first lady speaking publicly in washington for the 
first time since she and president reagan left for california more 
than four months ago offered a few insights into her old and new 
lives at a library of congress and random house forum on first 
ladies 
looking back mrs reagan told the audience that although the 
position of first lady offers a tremendous platform ironically 
in some ways a first lady loses her freedom of speech 
there were things i longed to say over those eight years 
mrs reagan said evoking a laugh from the crowd but i couldnt 
at times it wasnt appropriate and at other times it would have 
further complicated by husbands life 
the former actress recalled that in her first stage role she 
played a young woman that had been kidnapped and held in an attic 
with only a chance to utter one line 
there were times in the white house when i felt i was in the 
attic again mrs reagan said it was very frustrating 
mrs reagan is wrapping up her memoirs which will be published 
by random house in the fall while in washington the former first 
lady was also scheduled to appear at the american booksellers 
association to help tout her book 
entitled my turn the former white house resident promised 
it would deal with the major controversies of her eightyear 
tenure such as the renovation of the white house the new nancy 
reagan red china her use of astrology her battles with chief of 
staff donald regan and her stormy relationship with soviet first 
lady raisa gorbachev 
asked if there were any scoops in the volume she replied with a 
smile the title says it all 
the first lady said that while there is a certain dignity to 
holding silent she has turned to writing a book for her own peace 
of mind that of her children and in order to help set the record 
straight 
i felt i could start rebuilding a private life by writing 
about some things she said 
but when asked if shed ever offer her original personal 
diaries to be donated to her husbands presidential library a 
horrified look crossed mrs reagans face 
i certainly hope not i mean there are some things to be 
kept private she responded as the crowd erupted in chuckles and 
applause

wounded an israeli man saturday when he refused orders to stop his 
motorboat in egyptian waters israeli police said 
eyptian and israeli officials gave differing accounts of the 
incident 
foreign ministry spokesman allon liel said israel asked egypt 
for a clarification of the incident which occurred in the gulf 
of aqaba near israels red sea resort of eilat and egypts taba 
beach 
an egyptian coast guard official told the staterun middle east 
new agency the boat violated egyptian territory and that egypt had 
protested to israel the report said coast guard officials fired 
warning shots but it did not mention any casualties 
israels southern police district spokesman shalom ben himo said 
shlomo yisraeli 42 a resident of eilat was fishing in his motor 
boat when an egyptian patrol demanded he stop for identification 
he continued to move ben himo said the egyptians shot a 
few warning shots in the air and he was struck by a bullet in the 
leg 
israel radio said yisraeli was on the boat with his two children 
and a guest he refused to stop because he was in egyptian waters 
and his guest did not have a passport the radio reported 
it said yisraeli was shot in the leg and stomach and began 
losing large amounts of blood 
he was treated on the spot by an egyptian medic the patrol then 
let the boat dock at taba and yisraeli was transfered to an israeli 
hospital where he was in serious condition the radio reported

israelis was in october 1985 when a paramilitary egyptian police 
officer went berserk and killed seven israeli tourists at the red 
sea resort of ras burka

of the sinai desert in the 1967 middle east war the area is 
adjacent to the israeli town of eilat

in favor of democracy i deeply deplore the decision to use force 
against peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss of life 
bush said 
earlier bush had issued no formal reaction to the violence in 
beijing and white house aides had said the administrations 
comments would be made by secretary of state james a baker iii in 
washington baker was also sharply critical of the chinese action

president bush appealed saturday for a return 
to the path of reform and nonviolence while the ugly and 
chaotic crackdown on beijings prodemocracy demonstrators was 
called extremely deplorable by secretary of state james a 
baker iii 
bush issued a lateafternoon statement from his oceanside home 
in kennebunkport maine saying it was clear that the chinese 
government has chosen to use force against chinese citizens who 
were making a peaceful statement in favor of democracy 
i deeply deplore the decision to use force against peaceful 
demonstrators and the consequent loss of life the president said 
we have been urging and continue to urge nonviolence 
restraint and dialogue bush said tragically another course 
has been chosen again i urge a return to nonviolent means for 
dealing with the current situation 
he said the united states and china had build a constructive 
relationship over the last two decades through great efforts by 
both sides 
bush added that closer ties had benefitted both nations i 
hope that china will rapidly return to the path of political and 
economic reform and conditions of stability so that this 
relationship so important to both our peoples can continue its 
growth 
bush newly returned from a weeklong trip to europe initially 
issued no formal reaction to the military crackdown on chinese 
student demonstrators white house aides had said administration 
comment would come from baker 
in washington baker appeared on cnns newsmaker saturday 
and said that excessive force should not be used by the chinese 
government 
his appearance was interrupted by live telephone updates from 
reportrs on the scene observing violence in tiananmen square 
as the reporters relayed information that troops had opened fire 
on the demonstrators and that many people had been wounded the 
secretary could hear the sound of ambulances echoing in the 
background 
baker responding to the reports said the united states 
believed it would be unfortunate indeed if the army of the people 
were used to suppress the people 
its very important that excessive force not be used that 
would unfortunately appear to be the case baker saidthis will 
disturb the united states government and will disturb the american 
people considerably 
the secretary hinted that there could be repercussions to the 
chinese governments use of violence 
its important that the chinese people not lose the social and 
economic progress the developments theyve made socially and 
economically over the past decade baker said 
asked whether the united states should be sharing military and 
scientific technology with a government that shoots its own people 
baker responded 
lets see how this most recent and extremely deplorable 
development unfolds lets see what happens over the course of the 
next few days before we start hypothesizing about what we might or 
might not do in the future he said 
however sen jesse helms rnc said he would begin 
working with my colleagues to ensure that as a first response 
against this brutality all us military cooperation and sharing 
of technology with the communist government of china be terminated 
immediately 
it was the first violence to mar the weekslong prodemocracy 
demonstrations in china 
baker who appeared on the television show at midday said he 
had been in touch with bush and the us embassy in beijing during 
the previous hour 
but the official said he could not confirm the reports of deaths 
in the tiananmen square demonstrations 
unfortunately the situation in china is turning ugly and 
chaotic said baker 
baker noted that shooting has occurred in the square and that 
the embassy had asked its personnel to leave the are 
it is a situation that is not a happy one it is indeed 
turning quite ugly baker said 
the police contingent guarding the chinese embassy in washington 
appeared to be a little larger than usual saturday afternoon but 
there was no sign of activity outside chinese students studying in 
the united states had demonstrated outside the embassy last month 
in support of their colleagues in beijing 
the secretary said the united states has expressed its concern 
to the chinese government that the utmost restraint be used 
he took care to note that the chinese have exercised a 
significant amount of restraint during the past month that the 
demonstrations have gone on 
baker added that there have also been reports that molotov 
cocktails have been used in the most recent outbreak of violence 
and he indicated that restraint also should be observed by the 
demonstrators 
both sides have exercised a significant degree of restraint 
it is our hope that they will return to restraint baker said 
the secretary observed that a power struggle was going on in 
china but refused to offer any administration evaluation of the 
events 
id rather not go into any details of whos up and down 
baker said 
he said that while the administration had some opinions on 
it such comments would be interpreted as interfering in the 
internal affairs of another nation 
baker said the administration could only wait and see how it 
develops 
i dont think we should sit here today within hours of the 
first significant use of force against peaceful demonstrations 
and try to hypothesize about what that will mean baker said 
we will have to see what will happen lets see what 
happens now as we move forward were not sure what course this 
will take even now baker said

gov michael s dukakis said saturday his greatest 
regret in losing the presidential race was allowing george bush to 
malign massachusetts and swore to give the republicans a dose of 
their own medicine 
dukakis stopped just short of apologizing to the 4000 democrats 
gathered for the state partys annual convention though he has 
been under attack since coming home in defeat to face a mounting 
budget deficit many of the delegates said no apology was needed 
fiorello laguardia the late great mayor of new york used to 
say when i make a mistake its a beaut dukakis told the 
crowd and i made some beauts in the course of the campaign 
but what i regret most of all is that george bush didnt only 
succeed in painting a distorted picture of mike dukakis and what i 
stood for he also managed to put you down in the process 
dukakis said 
he put down this great commonwealth and its people he 
added and i let him get away with it and i shouldnt have 
during the presidential race the bush campaign attacked 
dukakis environmental record by drawing attention to the pollution 
in boston harbor and sought to discredit the economic 
massachusetts miracle 
delegates interrupted the speech repeatedly with applause some 
waved signs that read proud of michael dukakis 
dukakis then lambasted the republicans with caustic wit that 
supporters might have wished hed inflicted on george bush 
theres a party whose idea of public safety is seabrook a 
party whose environmental hero is james watt and whose program for 
cleaning up boston harbor was one boat ride last fall he said 
theyd probably make frank lorenzo secretary of labor he 
added earning a big laugh from labor delegates sporting hats and 
pins attacking the besieged eastern airlines owner 
dukakis has said he will not run for reelection for governor 
next year but hasnt ruled out another bid for the presidency in 
1992 he promised to keep massachusetts democratic in 1990 
lets shake off the doubts and the disclaimers he said 
lets give the republicans a dose of their own medicine 
reaction to the speech was divided with some saying dukakis 
should have offered more than a tepid apology and others 
maintaining an apology would only give dukebashing critics 
more ammunition 
i think it was an important apology said us rep chester 
atkins chairman of the state democratic party atkins said the 
governors decision to own up to the mistakes that have been 
made was the first step to restoring credibility 
us rep barney frank said while dukakis acknowledged mistakes 
in his campaign he did not take responsiblity for the deficit that 
mushroomed while he was away on the campaign trail 
i think it would have been better to acknowledge error on the 
financial situation as well frank said 
while dukakis was at the podium however some delegates were 
sizing up the floor where three potential democratic candidates 
for governor were trying to drum up support 
i think the bashings over said state rep susan tucker 
dandover hes on his way out and people recognize that the 
emphasis is on whos going to replace him

federal prosecutors declined to charge sen 
brock adams dwash with sexual assault because the young woman 
involved acknowledged that she pursued a meeting with him that 
night and did not leave after he made sexual advances according to 
a newly released letter 
the prosecutors also cited a lack of physical evidence or 
corroborating testimony for her account 
in response to a freedom of information act request by the 
associated press the us attorneys office released a copy a 
sept 1 1987 letter explaining the outcome to lawrence baskir 
attorney for kari tupper 
the letter was signed by charles h roistacher executive 
assistant to thenus attorney joseph digenova 
a former legislative aide and the daughter of longtime adams 
family friends ms tupper now 27 said in september of last year 
that adams now 62 had drugged and fondled her march 27 1987 in 
his washington dc home while his wife was away 
ms tupper said she had accepted an invitation to go to a 
restaurant with adams after determining to tell the senator to stop 
propositioning her 
adams has denied all her allegations but said he made a mistake 
letting her spend the night at his house 
roistacher wrote baskir 
she told the police that she has known senator adams for many 
years as a family friend she said that senator adams made sexual 
overtures toward her for several weeks if not longer 
nevertheless she arranged to have dinner alone with him when he 
did not appear she drove alone to his house arriving after dark 
there she had several drinks and by her account remained in 
his house and had another drink even after his conversation became 
explicitly sexual she went to the bathroom and recalls wondering 
whether name deleted by the government to protect privacy of 
third party would learn that she had been there she recalls 
little else except that she awoke the following morning to find 
that someone had removed her clothingsenator adams she said 
was lying by her side fondling her 
roistacher added that she did not report the incident to police 
for three days declined to identify her assailant until june and 
gave differing statements to police 
of the drugging allegation roistacher said no objective 
evidence supports your supposition about the drugging except ms 
tuppers symptoms the morning after which seem equally consistent 
with excess consumption of alcohol over the course of an evening 
a hospital test the day after showed no evidence of drugging 
although baskir had claimed her account was corroborated 
roistacher replied this abundant evidence does not consist of 
eyewitness testimony about the crime nor of physical scientific 
or medical evidence but the subsequent repetition of her story to 
close friends and relatives

for jurors in the twoweekold perjury trial of 
former republican rep pat swindall a familiar question is taking 
shape what did he know and when did he know it 
at issue is what swindall knew about money broker mike 
martinez actually undercover internal revenue service agent 
michael mullaney and where martinez claimed he got his money 
swindall negotiated with the agent for 850000 for home 
construction over one month in 1987 
swindall is accused in the 10count indictment of lying to a 
federal grand jury in february 1988 under the cloud of the 
indictment he lost his bid for a third term to democrat ben jones 
onetime star of the dukes of hazzard television show last 
november in a district in atlantas suburbs 
if convicted he faces 10 months to five years in prison on each 
count 
the jury in the case has heard audio tapes and seen videotapes 
in which swindall at various times acknowledged that drugs were 
the likely source of the money martinez had 
in those conversations mullaney also told swindall that the 
deal involved washing of cash and the congressman proposed 
receiving the money through a mortgage company created for the 
purpose by swindall associate charles lechasney a cuban emigre who 
has since been convicted of money laundering 
the tapes are the backbone of the governments case as 
prosecutors try to prove that swindall lied when he testified he 
did not recall discussing the illegal nature of the money handling 
and that he didnt recall being told the money was narcotics money 
among other allegations 
swindalls lead attorney richard hendrix says he will prove 
that lechasney was psychotic liar who deceived swindall into 
thinking the deal for 850000 from mullaney was all right while 
deceiving the agent into thinking swindall was a crook 
in crossexamination over three days last week hendrix hammered 
at mullaney over statements the agent himself made in the tapes 
mullaney told swindall at one point the money was flight 
capital then said at another point that it was not and could 
be anything 
flight capital is money sent out of troubled areas by wealthy 
people seeking to invest or store it in a stable country like the 
united states 
and more than two dozen times hendrix forced mullaney to 
concede that he did not know what kind of tale lechasney was 
telling swindall 
mullaney the governments first witness in the case was on the 
stand more than six days going onebyone over tapes of 16 
conversations he had with lechasney about the swindall deal plus 
five with the congressman himself and two meetings with both men 
tapes the jury saw or heard include one of a meeting between the 
three on sept 13 1987 at a posh west virginia resort 
martinez told swindall clearly i violate some currency 
laws and my gut feeling is there has to be narcotics dollars 
in there it is not flight capital 
anything you tell me is told in total confidence swindall 
replied 
later swindall said i am basically using charles as my 
buffer what i have to say is i borrowed money from 
gulfstates lechasneys company 
on sept 23 swindall indicated he knew lechasney would handle 
the cash in circumvention of bank reporting laws 
charles is going to ensure that basically the money is 
funneled in a way so that there are no reports filed mullaney 
said 
yeah im protected that way swindall replied 
finally as the deal collapsed on sept 26 swindall told the 
agent he would acknowledge an assignment of assets through 
lechasney to martinez but he could not accept the cash directly 
because i would then be laundering yalls money 
but hendrix in crossexamination repeatedly asked mullaney why 
he had misled the congressman when he told him flatly the money 
is flight capital 
as opposed to being laundered out of some drug scheme 
swindall said 
i would assume so the agent replied 
mullaney testified that he was portraying a drugmoney 
launderer and such a person would fudge details of the deal when 
talking on the telephone

thousands of smiling flagwaving poles gathered 
at their nations consulates in the united states on saturday to 
vote in the freest elections behind the iron curtain in 42 years 
for the first time were voting with pleasure ada cichy 
said as she stood in the entry hall of the consulate here 
polish diplomatic and contract workers and immigrants who remain 
polish citizens also flocked to consulates in new york and 
washington to vote a day in advance of sundays elections in poland 
the elections are the result of an agreement between the 
communist government and the solidarity trade union in which 
solidarity was given legal status after a sevenyear ban 
ballots from about 600000 poles abroad will be counted in a 
single district in the middle of warsaw which has only 140000 
eligible voters 
ninety percent of the people are going to vote for 
solidarity cichy said in chicago the party doesnt stand a 
chance 
the us results are not expected to be known until sunday 
morning at the earliest 
hundreds of people here greeted each other in polish on saturday 
as they waited in long lines under gray skies and frequent heavy 
rains a nearby bus shelter was plastered with posters for 
solidarity candidates 
these are our historys first really democratic elections 
said vice consul robert michniewicz the voters are excited and 
really happy ive seen a lot of smiles on their faces 
about 4000 people had turned out by early evening a sharp 
contrast to previous elections that typically drew only about 200 
people michniewicz said 
balloting was slowed by the small number of poll workers and a 
shortage of voting booths crowds of people sat in stairways and 
around coffee tables to mark paper ballots 
in new york hundreds of people crowded into the ornate 
consulate on madison avenue in midtown manhattan 
this is pure satisfaction said jack piotrowski of butler 
nj who emigrated from poland six years ago if it was the old 
kind of voting i wouldnt be here 
by early evening 5000 people had voted said mieczyslaw 
gorajewski an official poll watcher there 
busloads of people arrived from connecticut new jersey and 
massachusetts and hundreds came by subway a group of about 50 
from boston marched up a madison avenue with a solidarity flag 
it is amazing a polish miracle said tomasz zalewski of 
brooklyn an official poll watcher for solidarity 
in washington where few poles live about 175 people had turned 
up by noon said an embassy official who declined to give his name 
not everybody supported the balloting outside the chicago 
consulate jozef losiak handed out pamphlets urging a boycott 
these are not truly democratic elections losiak said for 
the first time the communist government is going to have a moral 
legitimacy in the eyes of the people we only want 100 percent free 
elections 
under the pact between the opposition and the government 65 
percent of the seats in polands 460member lower house or sejm 
are reserved for the communist party and its allies balloting for 
the new senate is wide open 
others in the united states urged fellow poles to vote wojtek 
sawa the host of a polishlanguage radio program in chicago 
handed out lists of the names of solidaritybacked candidates sawa 
called a boycott ridiculous 
for the first time in 45 years the people have a chance to 
gain some ground he said by not taking advantage of that we 
wouldnt gain anything

eds party planned as a step 
toward getting on with life brought some unwelcome notoriety 
saturday to the town where pan am flight 103 crashed 
lets party said ed blaus 14 of sicklerville nj for 
whom the event was named 
to some relatives of the 270 people killed by the terrorist bomb 
that felled the boeing 747 on dec 21 a party seemed 
inappropriate especially because of pan ams involvement 
londons daily telegraph called it a bizarre attempt to make 
up for the airliner disaster leaving the towns leaders 
defensive saturday 
given the circumstances of this town the party is unusual 
but it is being supported by the vast majority of the local people 
not to cause distress or anguish but to prove to themselves and the 
world that whereas we mourn those who died they are determined to 
repair their town rebuild shattered lives and ensure a special and 
sacred place in their hearts for 270 people from 24 nations said 
alex mcelroy chairman the local community support agency 
response was enthusiastic with families and groups of children 
heading toward the football ground as early as 9 am for a day of 
hamburgers hot dogs bagpipes and rock bands in the sun all wore 
red eds party badges to distinguish townspeople from reporters 
this is their town and their party mcelroy told a news 
conference 
pan am was not represented 
ed blaus said he had written asking the airline to send 
christmas presents to the children of lockerbie 
the first he heard of a party he said was when pan am invited 
him his parents and three brothers 
moses kungu a lockerbie pharmacist and regional councilor said 
pan am raised the idea of a summer christmas but townspeople 
suggested the party instead 
the idea is not pan ams it is from the community kungu 
said 
joe horgan of west point pa a member of the victims of pan am 
103 group was quoted by the dumfries and galloway standard as 
saying it is good for them to have a party but pan ams 
involvement is despicable we see this purely as a public relations 
exercise on their part 
about 20 relatives and friends of victims gathered outside pan 
ams new york headquarters saturday to protest the airlines role 
in the party 
im outraged said a tearful florence bissett whose 
21yearold son kenneth was killed in the bombing how can they 
do something like that picnic where bodies were found 
susan cohen of port jervis ny said we feel pan am should 
be putting its money into security not parties 
scottish police say they believe the plane was blown apart by a 
bomb hidden in a radiocassette player in the hold 
complaints from relatives led the disney organization to cancel 
plans to send mickey mouse to the party and the hebrew national 
company decided against supplying hot dogs 
the party doesnt mean that we are going to forget what 
happened on dec 21 but everyone must remember that it is 
primarily for the children said elma brockbank of lockerbie 
there is a feeling that perhaps the americans havent thought 
enough about our children after all they were looking forward to 
meeting mickey and minnie mouse she said 
kungu said children between 8 and 14 were affected most by the 
tragedy especially in the rosebank neighborhood where the planes 
engines jammed into the ground 
bodies were scattered all over the place children have seen 
that he said 
among special guests was syracuse university football coach dick 
mcpherson invited because several syracuse university students 
died in the bombing 
why am i here people are telling me that we can help said 
mcpherson who brought helmets and other american football 
equipment to show the children 
if they ask you to do something if you dont youre damned 
and if you do perhaps youre damned as well he said 
alan nicol who brought his two children said the party was a 
day for the children to remember and a day when everyone has got 
together on a happy occasion when we can begin to put the past 
behind us

the swiss socialist party decided saturday not to 
back a movement to dismantle the countrys army averting a crisis 
for the 30year coalition government 
after intense debate at a socialist congress in bern delegates 
voted 583 to 370 against taking any stand on a nov 26 national 
referendum on the proposal to disband switzerlands 625000member 
army 
socialist party president helmut hubacher had called the 
proposal a rotten egg and urged the party to take a clear stand 
against it 
the proposal has drawn a fierce reaction from the socialists 
three centerright partners in a governing alliance which is cited 
as a prime factor in switzerlands political stability 
a leader of the conservative swiss peoples party christoph 
blocher had said an antiarmy decision by the socialists should 
spell the end of the government coalition 
after the vote however blocher said the socialists should 
remain in the alliance 
the strongest reaction to the vote came from the free radical 
democrats switzerlands largest party which called for talks 
between the four parties on the socialists role in the government 
its official statement said the vote called into question the 
socialists commitment to switzerlands armed neutrality 
the third partner the christian democrats also criticized the 
socialists they said the socialists had lost credibility in 
deciding to take no stand 
saturdays special congress revealed deep divisions among the 
socialists themselves rightwing members and trade union leaders 
oppose the disarmament plan while young party members are 
particularly important in a pacifist groundswell 
even though delegates at the congress in the swiss capital 
decided by a majority of 213 against making a recommendation on 
referendum a surprising majority of 641 to 259 said they 
personally backed the noarmy proposal 
the antiarmy proposal was put forward by socialists and 
religious pacifists who collected 113000 signatures forcing the 
referendum the proposed amendment to the federal constitution says 
switzerland has no army and deletes all references to defense 
needs 
recent public opinion polls suggest that about one in four swiss 
voters might sympathize with the zero option 
protests have grown against lowflying combat planes and noise 
from militia target practice at the countrys shooting ranges 
but most swiss seem to oppose a farewell to arms in this country 
where the military has a long tradition even though the army has 
not fought a foreign war for five centuries

a car believed to have plunged into the great 
miami river when a temporary bridge collapsed was pulled from the 
river saturday with a body inside 
the body was the second found in the river since the may 26 
collapse of the onelane temporary us 52 bridge the body of 
helen c zorn 52 of the cincinnati suburb of green township was 
found floating in debris tuesday about five miles downriver from 
the bridge 
hamilton county authorities said this week that mrs zorns 
daughter terry siemon 27 was believed to have been with mrs 
zorn when the bridge collapsed 
sheriffs officers however could not immediately confirm that 
the body recovered saturday was that of ms siemon even though the 
car was identified as the one occupied by the mother and daughter 
said sheriffs spokesman frank weikel 
the body was taken to the hamilton county coroners office in 
cincinnati for identification weikel said 
professional divers working with a crane operator about 75 yards 
down river from the collapsed bridge located the submerged car the 
crane then dragged it out of the water 
later in the day heavy rain began falling on the site 12 miles 
west of cincinnati and the search for more victims was called off 
for several days until the river level drops back down weikel said 
strong underwater currents during the past week have frustrated 
recovery efforts which prompted sheriff simon leis jr to hire 
divers who have experience in underwater investigation at accident 
sites 
searchers using a sonar imaging device have been unable to find 
a second vehicle either a van or pickup truck that two witnesses 
reported seeing fall from the bridge 
there are no missingperson reports that came in on the van 
that supposedly went down so were beginning to think there was no 
van weikel said

cash in on what he calls the worlds first computer sport the 
game called battletech center is a mix of disneylike 
environmental fantasy and flight simulator technology he said 
players sit in four cockpits and must act as a team in a 
strategic video game simulating ground or air battles 
the desire to be tom cruise in top gun or luke skywalker in 
star wars to not have to live that experience vicariously i think 
thats a very common fantasy weisman said i wanted to create 
something that kids think about and use some strategy instead of 
just their trigger finger 
it took him eight years to develop the game and he is 
negotiating for lease space to open a battletech center in chicago 
by the end of the year players would pay 6 for a halfhour game

retiring surgeon general c everett koop said 
saturday the us health care system is unfair to millions of 
americans and he called for the appointment of a presidential 
commission to draft a plan for change 
in a commencement address to 2200 graduates of the university 
of massachusetts at boston koop catalogued the ills of the medical 
delivery and insurance system laying particular emphasis on 
inequities 
our current system of health care is not fair its not just 
and its not the morally strong system this country deserves he 
said 
the 72yearold koop who is retiring this year after eight 
years as surgeon general cited estimates that 37 million americans 
about 15 percent of the population have no health insurance 
while millions of others have only partial coverage 
he said health care costs have been rising at two to three times 
the rate of inflation as a whole and public expectations of 
medical care are fast outracing our ability to pay for them 
the former pediatric surgeon also was critical of both doctors 
and hospitals saying he did not foresee the medical profession 
achieving any success in selfregulation he noted that many 
hospitals have tried to cut the number of indigent patients they 
treat 
i say theres something terribly wrong with a system of health 
care that spends more and more money to serve fewer and fewer 
people he said 
koop provided no specific recommendations for reform however 
beyond suggesting the appointment of a presidential commission 
he did not call for national health insurance even though he 
was introduced by sen edward m kennedy dmass a strong 
supporter of that concept 
he also steered clear of the term socialized medicine saying he 
favored a laissezfaire marketplace and a competitive economy 
one of the problems of the current health care system he said is 
that it is distinguished by a lack of competition in price 
quality or service 
we need a presidential commission the bluest of blueribbon 
panels to consider the future of health care in america he said 
koop suggested that the panel include health care professionals 
insurance industry representatives and members of congress 
while the creation of a more equitable health care system will 
be a major task for america koop said it is something we 
need to prove to ourselves and the world if the nation is to 
retain its moral strength

more than 4000 antinuclear activists 
saturday staged the biggest rally against the seabrook nuclear 
plant in 11 years a prelude to a civil disobedience protest 
planned for sunday 
traffic lined a highway that runs by the seaside plant and many 
of the cars sported antiseabrook signs at hampton beach state 
park less than two miles from the plant protesters heard speakers 
denounce seabrook and promise to continue fighting to prevent it 
from operating commercially 
seabrook opponent steve comley drew cheers when he told the 
gathering he had hired planes pulling antinuclear banners to fly 
over the beach saturday and about 40 miles up the maine coast to 
president bushs home at kennebunkport maine on sunday bush was 
spending the weekend there 
the nuclear industry and some of the people in washington 
believe this fight is over comley said ill tell you were 
just starting 
the antinuclear clamshell alliance is organizing the protests 
which it hopes will be the biggest since may 1977 when 1414 
people were arrested at the seabrook site about 2500 arrests have 
been made in protests at the plant since construction began in 1976 
saturdays rally had the largest turnout since a 1978 protest 
that drew an estimated 18000 people 
officials in neighboring massachusetts also have sought to block 
the plant by refusing to cooperate with emergency evacuation 
planning despite the opposition seabrook won its lowpower 
testing license from federal regulators on may 26 nearly three 
years after the 6 billion reactor was completed 
plant officials have begun preparing for the first atomic chain 
reaction by tuesday or wednesday plant spokesman ron sher said 
sher who stopped by the rally said the protesters represented 
a vocal minority 
but the majority of people in new hampshire massachusetts and 
the rest of new england recognize that nuclear power is a viable 
energy alternative and seabrook is ready to produce electricity 
and it can make an important contribution sher said 
the plant first must win federal approval for evacuation plans 
for crowded summer beaches and communities up to 10 miles away 
the truth is you cannot evacuate hampton beach and the other 
beaches and protect the people attorney robert backus who has 
represented antiseabrook groups since 1972 told the crowd 
the truth is we dont know what to do with nuclear waste 
backus said the truth is that the plant is uneconomic 
before the weekend at least 300 to 500 people went through 
training sessions on nonviolent civil disobedience clamshell 
spokesman paul gunter said the sessions continued saturday 
on sunday some activists planned to climb fences surrounding 
the 715acre plant site and others planned to sit down outside 
gates some protesters also planned to go to a railroad siding at 
the plant to recreate an august 1976 protest in which 18 people 
were arrested the first group civil disobedience against a us 
nuclear power plant 
earlier in the week superior court judge vincent dunn let the 
town charge the organizers a 300 fee and 3600 bond for an 
assembly permit clamshell members said they couldnt and wouldnt 
pay 
since a town ordinance bars gatherings of more than 25 people 
without a permit the activists said they planned to march to the 
plant on sunday in groups of fewer than 20

protest the inauguration thursday of the president alfredo

just as important as dismantling the ussupported nicaraguan 
rebels 
he has pledged not to negotiate changes in the political system 
with the rebels but has offered talks instead on integrating them 
into civilian life 
in their statement the rebels said they stood ready to 
negotiate a political solution to their nineyear war against the 
usbacked government but they said cristianis proposal did not 
offer them a chance to do so and that it was an invitation to 
surrender 
the rebel communique instead invited el salvadors political 
parties to sponsor a peace dialogue 
the rebels said the new president had been trying to project 
an image acceptable to the united states and the european 
community but the content of his speech was predominantly 
confrontation strictly faithful to the politics and economics of 
arena

sandinistas have often denied such charges claiming they provide 
only moral support 
cristiani praised a central american initiative aimed at 
negotiating peaceful solutions to conflicts in nicaragua and el 
salvador the accords call for demobilizing the nicaraguan rebels 
who now live in border camps in neighboring honduras

dawn broke sunday over a battlescarred tiananmen 
square with tanks and rifletoting troops ruling the vast expanse 
occupied the day before by students seeking a freer society from 
their communist rulers 
a low cloud of smoke covered much of the 100acre square as 
bonfires set during the nights confrontation continued to smolder 
hundreds of helmeted troops were deployed on the monument to 
revolutionary heroes in the squares center and thousands more at 
important intersections nearby tanks moved into place on what had 
hours earlier been a ragtag squatters camp of tents for the 
prodemocracy students 
the battle for tiananmen was primarily fought in the streets 
leading to the square where scores of people fell trying to 
prevent columns of troops and armored military vehicles from moving 
on the students 
gunfire could be heard from several sides and tracers zipped 
through the sky above mao tsetungs mausoleum one of the main 
monuments to chinese communism in the square torched buses and 
army vehicles on the streets around tiananmen billowed acrid smoke 
troops first entered the square from the south when a column 
trotted toward the student encampment about 1 am noon edt 
saturday they took up positions to the east after a brief 
skirmish involving clubs and sticks with students 
more soldiers were deployed in front of the great hall of the 
people to the west and a huge convoy with armored vehicles rolled 
down changan avenue to the north side 
the few thousand students remaining in the square stayed calm as 
they quietly gathered on the steps of the heroes monument im 
not afraid several said as the heavily armed troops encircled 
hundreds of supporters continued to mill around the square many 
dressed more for a summer outing than a military battle 
loudspeakers blaring government and student announcements 
engaged in a noisy propaganda battle throughout the night 
the government is corrupt youve been tricked the students 
roared the staterun speaker warned that troops would use every 
means at their disposal to clear the square and that remaining 
students would bear responsibility for the consequences 
at 4 am the lamposts that dot the square went ominously dark 
and the student loudspeaker played the internationale the 
socialist anthem a taiwan singer staging a hunger strike for 
democracy took the microphone and proclaimed weve achieved a 
big victory were not afraid to die but weve already lost 
too much blood 
after the lights went back on a half hour later a voice vote by 
the students showed most wanted to leave the square to avoid 
further bloodshed 
they quickly filed out under the banners of their schools 
carrying the quilts and padded jackets that offered warmth during 
the 22day sitin neither the students nor the beijing residents 
who arrived to show support could control their tears 
go with us they told their supporters who applauded the 
students as they retreated as they sobbed many students defiantly 
shouted we shall return and flashed vforvictory signs

down trees tore off doors and damaged many homes and about 80 
percent of the businesses in this northcentral new jersey 
township about 40 miles west of new york city officials said the 
plant makes gunpowder for military and commercial uses 
theres absolutely nothing there but dirt and it doesnt even 
look that there was a building there said val mazzucca a 
witness who flew over the site in a helicopter several hours after 
the blast all of the trees are blown over on the sides it looks 
like mount st helens 
three of about 40 buildings at the 6squaremile complex were 
destroyed four others had fire damage and several others were 
partly damaged plant manager dick best said he said he did not 
know the cause of the blast 
it was a chain reaction he said i dont know how and 
why 
about 30000 jersey central power amp light customers in a 10mile 
radius of the blast site lost power for two minutes after the 
blast said eunice mackie a company spokesman 
salvatore rappa said he was working inside the finishing area of 
the plant when he heard an explosion 
all i know is that the lights flickered on and off throughout 
the whole building and in about 15 seconds there was the first 
explosion rappa said everyone hit the deck and there was a 
major panic 
about 50 employees were working on the overnight shift best 
said there apparently were no lifethreatening injuries 
a supervisor for dover general hospital said 12 hercules 
employees had been brought in nine of them and about half a dozen 
townspeople were treated and released and three employees were 
admitted with injuries ranging from back pains to a concussion

an explosion on feb 22 1985 at the companys sayerville 
plant about 20 miles to the southwest killed an employee and 
injured four other people 
best said the material that exploded sunday was a smokeless 
propellant used in shotgun shells 
he said that to limit damage the plant is divided into 
compartments that each contain no more than 1000 pounds of 
gunpowder the gunpowder plant is located in a somewhat isolated 
area near several small towns 
there are windows blown out throughout the area said sgt 
mike hass of the randolph police department about three miles 
from roxbury township police said they received about 200 damage 
reports 
were assisting standing by at the businesses in terms of 
looting that may occur hass said 
roxbury fire chief john ward said a fire caused by the blast was 
put out by 8 am 
a resident of flanders about five miles away from the plant 
said he was awakened by four loud explosions 
it blew me right out of bed said john larson at 505 one 
went off then three more went off the blinds blew right out from 
the window 
jay brown who lives half a mile from the plant said we saw 
the flames go up and then we heard an explosion the first one felt 
like an earthquake the second one blew out the windows of my house 
and busted the garage door right off the frame 
rudy spagnola a state farm insurance co agent with an office 
in a shopping center about a mile from the plant said the 
explosion shook the blinds at his house in morristown 13 miles away

smoke from burning vehicles cast a pall over 
tiananmen square sunday morning after violence that will leave a 
permanent scar on china 
the numbers of dead and wounded from military attacks on 
demonstrators were estimated in the hundreds massive arrests are 
inevitable along with purges in the communist party leadership 
the military action made it clear the government was willing to 
use brutal force against mainly unarmed and peaceful demonstrators 
to ensure the privileges and power of an aging leadership and to 
perpetuate the political system 
deng xiaoping chinas 84yearold senior leader may have 
forfeited his place as one of the 20th centurys great statesmen 
his 10 years of economic reforms tarnished by his willingness to 
have blood shed rather than relinquish political power 
premier li peng who refused to meet with students and discuss 
their pleas for greater democracy and instead declared martial law 
in beijing on may 20 has won the odium of millions 
other elder leaders who dredged up their hardline ideologies 
rather than listen to the pulse of the nation also will be known as 
men who sanctioned the killings of young idealists 
the peoples liberation army betrayed the chants of the students 
that the peoples army loves the people reflecting the 
respect many chinese had for the army until sunday morning 
the crushing of the protests reaffirmed dengs philosophy that 
political stability is crucial for economic modernization and 
social unrest is intolerable 
but his quest for stability may be in jeopardy military force 
will not quiet the resentment of official corruption expressed by 
the students at tiananmen 
troops in the streets may drive antigovernment and antiparty 
expressions underground for a while but they cannot eradicate them 
student leaders referring to government suppression spoke of a 
long winter coming that will affect the nations faltering 
economic plans 
with the government divided and weakened by strife problems of 
inflation unemployment and labor unrest will be unattended 
if the conservatives push through their purge of communist party 
chief zhao ziyang and other moderates who opposed the crackdown 
china could be deprived of a generation of creative and progressive 
thinkers 
the flow of desperately needed foreign investments will suffer 
because of the political crisis tourism will decline 
china and the united states long at odds over human rights 
issues could be heading for cooler relations that will involve 
us willingness to provide technology and economic assistance 
president bush said saturday he deeply deplored the decision to 
use force against peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss 
of life 
chinese leaders often note chinas 4000year history and say 
the chinese have the wisdom and patience to outlast crises of the 
moment 
but chinese observing the rapid changes in the soviet union and 
eastern europe will not be satisfied with reciting catechisms of 
communism and the evils of bourgeois liberalization 
chinese need only look back at the last tiananmen incident on 
april 5 1976 to note that violence can destroy those who initiate 
it 
on that date a radical clique seeking to cement its power 
ordered out military units that killed about 100 people who had 
gone to the square to mourn the late premier chou enlai horror 
and anger at the killings led to events that brought about the 
downfall of the radicals six months later and the emergence of deng 
xiaoping

a ruptured pipeline spilled about 13200 
gallons of crude oil into the yampa river home to two endangered 
species of fish officials said 
the amoco pipeline co line near here broke open early friday 
said moffat county sheriff jeff corriveau it was discovered when 
an oil slick was spotted on the yampa three miles below the point 
where the pipe crosses the northwestern colorado river 
amoco officials immediately turned off the pumps to the 6inch 
diameter line stopping the flow of oil within a few hours said 
jerry white the companys area manager in casper wyo 
amoco officials estimated that about 300 barrels or about 
13200 gallons spilled into the river crews were immediately 
dispatched to throw oilcollection booms across the river 
the spill is in the no 1 area for the colorado squawfish 
which is endangered said state fish and wildlife service biologist 
harold tyus in the next few weeks the squawfish will be in the 
peak of their spawning season 
the endangered humpback chub also swims in the yampa as do game 
fish such as pike trout and catfish 
the 106mile pipeline links an oilfield near craig with storage 
tanks near wamsutter in south central wyoming it was built 45 
years ago and rebuilt in 1986 and is pipeline is buried 3 feet 
underground 
i dont think theres any suggestion of sabotage but were 
investigating and cleaning up at the same time white said 
the oil traveling downstream at about 4 mph is expected to 
reach the yampas confluence with the green river late saturday or 
early sunday jim knoy of the us environmental protection 
administrations denver office said saturday 
the oil will have to pass through rapids which will help break 
it up knoy said 
knoy said that if amocos estimate of the spills size was 
correct no longterm cleanup will be needed 
the cause of the rupture was being investigated officials said

the military suppression in china organizer alfred lui told the

chinese consulate weeping as the protesters played a recording of 
what they said were telephone conversations with relatives and 
friends in beijing as they witnessed the army sweep of tiananmen 
square 
we are very disappointed and angry with the chinese 
government said richard leung a protest organizer and student 
at the university of californialos angeles we urge the us 
authorities to make every effort to support human rights and stop 
the bloodshed 
president bush said in a statement from kennebunkport maine 
saturday i deeply deplore the decision to use force against 
peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss of life he called 
for nonviolence restraint and dialogue 
it was early sunday in beijing 13 hours ahead of the eastern 
united states when chinese troops stormed through masses of 
prodemocracy protesters in tiananmen square shooting and beating 
hundreds of people at least 500 were reported killed 
in st paul about 250 chinese students marched around the 
minnesota capitol wearing black armbands and green and white 
ribbons a chinese symbol of mourning they bowed their heads in 
memory of the slain 
at a rally at louisiana state university medical center gan xia 
ge a 31yearold graduate student said im worried about my 
brother the army is just shooting people he may be dead 
id like to be there with them but i think we can also do 
something here in america said philip lam a los angeles

judith shapiro a scholar who met husband liang heng in china 
during the 1970s and wrote two books about that country with him 
said the violence created a serious potential for civil war 
i think that until today many students and intellectuals 
believed that the communist party was genuinely trying to reform 
itself from within ms shapiro said 
but with the results of todays actions the chinese party has 
lost any semblance of legitimacy for these people these people 
feel deeply betrayed theyre deeply angry said ms shapiro who 
works for the foreign policy research institute a think tank in 
elkins park pa 
the crackdown could badly damage chinas ability to attract 
needed dollars through tourism exports and investments a 
professor said 
its not hard to imagine that a lot of people are going to be 
reluctant to put money into china now for obvious reasons tufts 
university political science professor don klein said in boston he 
noted that the united states is second only to japan in providing 
tourists to china which he said netted 2 billion from that 
industry last year 
the connecticut house of representatives interrupted a debate on 
a prison overcrowding bill to stand in silence as a salute to the 
chinese students rep richard tulisano told the hushed chamber in

a cbs news correspondent and cameraman were 
detained by the chinese army while an nbc news crew had to dodge 
police and bullets during the bloody suppression of the protest in 
beijing early sunday 
it was not immediately clear whether any of the journalists were 
formally arrested or were being detained to prevent coverage of 
chinese troops that stormed tiananmen square killing and wounding 
scores of people 
its been very intense and tragic theyre seeing acts of 
heroism that i dont think anyone expects to see in a lifetime 
joseph angotti senior vice president of news for nbc said of 
journalists at the scene 
ive never heard the kind of strain in peoples voices ive 
heard today a lot of fear is coming through on the phone lines 
he said 
angotti said an nbc cameraman and sound man were unable to 
contact the network for more than four hours after they got caught 
in the chaos while recording events on the southern end of the 
square 
they got trapped on one side of the square angotti said 
they literally had to go block by block taking cover in houses as 
they went along because police kept clearing the streets they were 
shot at twice by police before they could get a couple of miles to 
the hotel 
cbs news correspondent richard roth and cameraman derek williams 
were apparently taken away by the chinese army shortly after 4 pm 
as they described the assault on the square said cbs news 
spokesman tom goodman 
were making every effort to locate them but its very 
difficult he said 
when cbs last heard from roth he was describing the scene at 
the square 
ok weve got to get out of here roth said in an 
increasingly shaky voice they the army are going after derek 
theyre ripping away his camara they are coming for us we are 
trying to get away 
goodman said the sound of gunfire was then heard in the 
background and roth could be heard over his cellular telephone 
which was left on saying either oh no oh no or ill go 
ill go 
two chineseamericans in roths crew dexter leong a soundman 
and robert lum an assistant were able to blend in with the crowd 
and returned to cbs headquarters in beijing goodman said 
leong reported that none of the four were injured and another 
cbs correspondent later said he believed roth and williams were 
taken into the great hall by members of the chinese army 
leong later said we were filming the event suddenly army 
soldiers appeared five feet behind us they just grabbed the 
camera yanked it down about five seconds after they grabbed they 
camera they began to shoot into the crowd 
laura wessner an abc spokeswoman said all their broadcast crew 
members were safe 
everything is fine all our crews are fine she said 
she said chinese authorities have not taken action to prevent 
the crews from doing their jobs 
a cable news network producer donna liu was carrying 
videotapes through tiananmen square sunday as the troops moved in 
when she was approached by military officials who demanded that she 
turn the tapes over 
her tapes were taken away and she slipped away before she 
could get into any trouble with the authorities said rob golden 
assistant foreign editor at cnns atlanta headquarters 
the cable news program has two correspondents and three crews in 
beijing golden said the correspondents have been working out of 
their hotel room while the crews were out in the square during the 
massacre 
to make up for the lack of video footage cnn has been using 
still photographs taken by one of the crew golden said 
its probably one of the most emotional days any of our people 
have been through over there angotti said

voting residence a move he would be required to make by november 
if he is to become a candiate for mayor in the citys 1990 
elections 
jackson will probably move into the house in august or 
september said a source close to jackson speaking on condition of 
anonymity

finished jackson said of course yes 
asked if he intends to make it his legal residence and to 
register to vote in the city jackson answered we have not made 
such a decision 
jackson has said repeatedly that he is in washington several 
times a week and he wants to live in the house rather than stay at 
a hotel 
washington mayor marion s barry has the object of criminal 
investigations involving drugs and has been beset by a series of

cracks found in the ceilings and floors 
of two test rooms in an underground nuclear waste repository could 
cause problems with worker safety and waste retrieval a technical 
oversight expert said saturday 
the us department of energy however had anticipated the 
cracks in the waste isolation pilot plant test rooms in 
southeastern new mexico and is still aiming for a september opening 
date said ben mccarty an agency spokesman 
wipp is a doe project designed to store plutoniumcontaminated 
waste related to defense 2150 feet below the surface in ancient 
salt beds 26 miles southeast of carlsbad 
lokesh chaturvedi deputy director of the environmental 
evaluation group which is helping to monitor the project said the 
cracks pose two potential problems worker safety and the ease 
with which waste can be retrieved from the site if there are 
problems 
four test rooms each 300 feet long 33 feet wide and 13 feet 
high were excavated in march and april 1983 researchers are 
using the rooms to study the the behavior of salt collapsing around 
55gallon drums of nuclear waste chaturvedi said 
soon after the rooms were excavated it was found that the 
rate of collapse was three to four times higher than predicted 
he said 
that was a good sign because the faster the rooms close the 
faster the waste will become entombed chaturvedi said the drums 
are expected to corrode away in 20 years he said 
but in 1985 a 4inchwide crack appeared walltowall in the 
floor of one of the rooms when 3footdiameter holes were being 
drilled chaturvedi said 
that was of concern because it showed salt moved in fast but 
it was cracking because of impurities in the salt he said 
then in 1987 the doe found two continuous fractures above the 
roofs of two other test rooms one about 3 feet above the ceiling 
and another about 7 feet above chaturvedi said 
it posed dangers to workers who had equipment in the room so 
the doe decided to clear out the rooms or have limitedaccess 
rooms said chaturvedi who learned about the cracks may 2 
mccarty said the rooms are supposed to come down its just an 
experiment he said 
wendell weart chief wipp scientist for sandia national 
laboratories said the anticipated desirable effects of socalled 
salt creep have been considered and retrieval is still assured 
mccarty said analysis of the cracking was not included in a 
supplemental environmental impact statement because there are 
established mining procedures to prevent problems from the cracks 
the procedures includied reinforcing the two rooms with the most 
recent cracks with rock bolts no waste will be placed in the 
unbolted rooms mccarty said 
weart said the rock bolts will assure that no loose slabs of 
salt could fall and breach a waste drum assuring adequate 
stability through the retrieval period 
chaturvedi however contended that if doe officials put 
thousands of drums in the rooms to be taken out there might be 
a problem in retrieving the waste because one cannot be absolutely 
be certain that rockbolting will keep the ceiling as well as the 
floor from buckling 
the doe has a fiveyear experimental and operational phase in 
which to put waste in the rooms and take it out 
the whole thing lies on the doe plan do they want to place 
waste temporarily instead of permanently if they were simply to 
make the decision permanently then we would not have to worry 
about these questions he said 
chaturvedi said his group would simply like the doe not to put 
a large quantity of waste underground without first making certain 
that they need to leave it there 
his group funded by the doe is charged with technical 
evaluation of wipp for the health and safety of the public and the 
environment

a man convicted of bilking hundreds of people 
of 20 million through a pyramid scheme received a 15year prison 
sentence with an unusual 10year probation but promised investors 
theyd get their money back 
authorities however said the reimbursement plan that stephen 
l smith proposed friday was just another attempt to mislead 
investors in his sh oil and gas exploration company 
circuit judge j tim strickland in bartow sentenced smith on 
wednesday to 15 years in prison and banned him from owning an 
expensive home driving an exotic automobile or doing consulting 
work for 10 years after his release 
smith 38 will also be prohibited from making more than 30000 
a year during the probation and must give lectures on the evils of 
whitecollar crime at colleges and high schools 
smith who has also been sentenced to 10 years behind bars on 
federal bank fraud violations could be released from prison after 
four years 
his attorney montjoy trimble of lexington ky said he would 
appeal stricklands probation sentence 
smith pleaded guilty in march to 98 state felony charges he was 
accused of cheating about 700 investors out of 20 million between 
1979 and 1987 through a 125 million pyramid scheme 
a creditors meeting at bankruptcy court in tampa on friday 
marked the first time that smith answered questions from both 
investors and investigators since the state closed sh oil in 
december 1987 
smith promised 50 investors who attended that he would provide a 
reimbursement plan to handle any and all alleged shortfalls 
youve had since sh oil was closed 
smith didnt elaborate on the plan during the meeting but said 
it was designed to refund lost investments within 10 to 15 years 
he said the plan would pay investors 1 to 15 million annually 
for nine to 14 years then pay them a lump sum of 115 million to 
18 million in 10th or 15th year 
attorney allan watkins hired to help sh oils federal trustee 
called smiths plan ouija board economics 
terry smith the trustee administering 10 million to 15 
million worth of seized sh oil assets said the reimbursement plan 
is taking assets and playing investment games with them 
i say just give the money back to creditors and let them 
manage their own money terry smith said 
stephen smith filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy feb 24 he claimed 
assets of about 15 million and liabilities of about 250 million 
smith who remains free on 350000 in state and federal bonds 
is scheduled to report to saufley federal prison near pensacola on 
wednesday his attorney said

prostitution and prejudice against homosexuals 
are hindering efforts to control the spread of aids in developing 
countries a group of international health workers said saturday 
they spoke in montreal where the fifth international conference 
on aids opens sunday and 12000 delegates are expected to attend 
prostitution has been a major factor in the wildfirelike 
spread of aids through central africa said chandra mouli head 
of an aids education project in zambia 
because of high levels of unemployment young women often 
have no practical alternatives to prostitution 
the world health organization has received reports of 23000 
cases of aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome in africa 
but many cases are not reported and the figure is believed to be 
closer to 100000 
poverty also has contributed to the large numbers of male 
prostitutes in thailand according to natee teerarojjanapongs a 
thai specialist 
he said there have been few attempts to educate thailands 
homosexuals and test them for the presence of the virus of the 
deadly disease 
norma kaminsky a costa rican community health worker said that 
in latin american countries most aids victims have been homosexual 
men and hemophiliacs 
central and south american countries have reported 11000 aids 
cases to the world health organization the number of aids victims 
in the united states is nearing 100000 
ms kaminsky said poor relations between police and latin 
american homosexual communities have hampered the detection and 
prevention of aids 
lack of trust in the authorities has been a major obstacle 
she said homosexuality has been repressed by the police gay 
bars have been closed and gays have been pursued 
a governmentsponsored television campaign in chile to educate 
the public about aids encountered strong social opposition said 
alonso de la carrera a santiagobased health worker 
when the messages were broadcast in march following long delays 
they were aimed exclusively at the heterosexual population and 
contained no concrete information on prevention of aids he said 
african governments are struggling to control the aids epidemic 
the health workers from that continent said 
a study in the kagera region of northwestern tanzania found 
4000 orphans were aids carriers said dr fj owenya a red cross 
worker 
he said that in addition to prostitution in the region the 
common practice of sharing of unsterilized instruments such as 
razor blades and safety pins to pierce ears has contributed to the 
spread of aids

caught in the middle of a drawbridge while it was raised forcing 
him to hang by his fingertips as his chair plunged into the water 
witnesses and authorities said 
charles hisoire 38 grabbed the edge of the bridge and hung 
over the intracoastal waterway for about two minutes before he was 
rescued by a man riding his bicycle home 
i went running like crazy said the rescuer marek 
dabrowski 46 who added that at first he thought the man had 
fallen into the water 
but when i got there he was hanging on by his fingers i 
grabbed his forearm then lifted him out by the collar and belt 
before the bridge went back down 
hisoire said he heard the drawbridge bell ring but was 
distracted because he had been talking with a fisherman he had 
almost made it to the center of the span when the tender began 
raising the middle bridge a police report said 
i started yelling and screaming and waving my hands so the man 
in the shed would see me hisoire said friday but he kept 
raising the bridge and i kept on sliding down 
the tender thomas goss said he checked the bridge before 
raising it and did not see anyone an 8foot sign may have 
partially blocked his view police said 
i never saw that man before in my life until that bridge was 
closed goss said 
hisoire who was paralyzed from the waist down in january after 
he fell from a wall onto a concrete walk said he was thankful that 
dabrowski happened along 
police agreed 
if that bridge would have closed it would have amputated his 
arms said palm beach sgt mike galvin he would have fallen 
into the water and we would have never found him

a us magistrate friday ordered three 
environmental activists held without bail in an alleged conspiracy 
to sabotage nuclear plants in three western states but released 
the man described as their guru 
us magistrate morton sitver released david foreman 42 the 
founder of the radical activist group earth first on a 50000 
unsecured bond after a 2hour detention hearing 
sitver ordered mark leslie davis 39 marc baker 37 and 
margaret peggy millett 35 all of prescott held for trial 
foreman a tucson resident is charged with conspiracy while the 
other three face a count each of conspiracy and three types of 
property destruction 
sitver said davis and mrs millett were flight risks as well as 
dangers to the community and he called baker dangerous 
in arguing for foremans detention assistant us attorney 
roger dokken claimed the activist was the ringleader 
mr foreman is the worst of the group dokken said he 
sneaks around in the background he was the financier the leader 
sort of the guru to get all of this going i dont like to use the 
analogy of a mafia boss but they never do anything either they 
just send their munchkins out to do it 
defense lawyers said the alleged conspirators always notified 
the public during what they called monkeywrenching operations 
a reference to a book written by the late edward abbey describing a 
fictional plot by ecoraiders to blow up a dam 
foremans attorney richard sherman of jackson wyo said he 
was gratified by foremans release but added that all the 
defendants should have been treated with the same consideration 
apparently the magistrate felt they were a danger to society 
i respectfully disagree he said 
baker davis and millett were committed to attacks on the palo 
verde and diablo canyon nuclear complexes of wintersburg ariz 
and san luis obispo calif respectively and the rocky flats 
nuclear weapons center near denver according to fbi testimony 
based on taperecorded conversations 
fbi agent lori bailey testified that davis baker and mrs 
millett took an undercover agent to a spot near wenden ariz 
about 75 miles west of here late tuesday to practice knocking down 
metal powerline towers 
the tower they chose provides power for a pumping station of the 
central arizona project which carries water from the colorado 
river to arizonas interior 
fbi agents on the ground and in a us customs service 
helicopter arrested davis and baker at the site but mrs millett 
slipped through and escaped miss bailey testified 
foreman was arrested wednesday morning in tucson and mrs 
millett was arrested in prescott wednesday afternoon miss bailey 
said 
the fbi had been investigating the alleged conspiracy since a 
may 1986 attempt to shortcircuit palo verde powerlines by throwing 
metal cables across hightension wires she said 
miss bailey testified that the undercover agent accompanied 
davis to tucson several times and saw foreman give davis 580 and 
later 100 to use in training two or threeperson groups for the 
strikes 
foreman opposed the idea of knocking out a cap pumping station 
as a useless goad against public sentiment but was enthusiastic 
about hitting nuclear facilities miss bailey said 
the magistrate set foremans surety bond for 50000 but 
accepted his signature for release sitver also ordered foreman 
who has written a field manual called ecodefense a field guide 
to monkeywrenching to supply names and addresses of any of his 
publishers 
foremans book offers instructions on such actions as toppling 
powerline towersw putting spikes into trees to discourage loggers 
with chain saws and knocking bulldozers and helicopters out of 
order by putting sand in engine oil 
but the book carries a disclaimer of being for entertainment 
purposes only saying no one involved with the production of 
this book encourages anyone to do any of the stupid illegal 
things contained herein

distinction of being the most expensive segment of freeway ever 
built 
it is part of a 146 billion highway project for the 
mushrooming seattle metropolis to build roads that probably will be 
badly congested by the time they are completed in 1994 
for the time being the new link between seattle and bellevue 
across lake washington brings welcome relief from the twicedaily 
creep across the lakes two existing fourlane spans that become 
jammed by fenderbenders 
commuters also say goodbye to an infamous i90 lane that 
switched direction depending on the commute with no barrier to 
separate traffic motorists tagged it the death lane 
at about 200 million a mile the freeway has set a record for 
costliness

can probably still expect the biggest rise in food prices in eight 
years economists say 
its 200 percent better last year was grim says doug 
miller who farms 350 acres in st joseph county in northcentral 
indiana 
generous spring rains provided a breather from drought in the 
midwest and sent grain prices tumbling on commodity markets but 
they havent come close to replenishing parched soil deep down or 
washing out predictions for a food price increase of up to 7 
percent 
the drought of 88 reduced corn yields 30 percent nationwide and 
soybean production 20 percent then a dry winter coupled with 
dust storms and subarctic freezes devastated winter wheat 
production with 39 percent of that crop now deemed either in poor 
or very poor shape as the harvest approaches

the germans thought the diminutive horse soldiers 
with oriental features were devils when they first invaded europe 
in the 5th century with attila the hun at their head 
nine centuries later the middle east recoiled in horror as 
another eurasian horde led by tamerlane razed cities and stacked 
human skulls into towering pyramids 
the chinese even built the great wall of china in the 3rd 
century to keep out the havocwreaking warriors 
but scholars say the eurasian nomads were not the simple 
barbarians history often has portrayed them as situated along key 
trade routes linking asia and europe the nomadic tribes had a 
class system and customs and invented saddles the game of polo 
and bowstringed instruments 
they created their own culture in spite of being viewed as 
barbarians by the sedentary population said dr vladimir 
basilov chief curator of the soviet exhibit nomads masters of 
the eurasian steppe which opened june 4 at the denver museum of 
natural history 
we shouldnt think that they just rode with their animals 
dirty and joyful with their food again they created their own 
culture 
the exhibit which covers a 3000year span of the nomadic 
culture represents the largest cultural exchange in the field of 
natural history between the united states and the soviet union 
featuring nearly 1400 artifacts the exhibit began its us 
tour in february at the natural history museum of los angeles 
county it will remain in denver through sept 10 and will make 
its final stop at the smithsonian institution in washington the 
exhibit also has been shown in japan finland and london 
the artifacts were collected from eight museums across the 
soviet union and include some that never have been displayed in the 
soviet union museum officials said 
basilov who has worked on the project for about 10 years said 
the three us sites were chosen because they were large enough to 
accommodate the exhibits size 
from mannequins modeling brilliantly colored clothing to a tiny 
bronze lock molded in the shape of a deer the exhibit provides an 
unusual glimpse into the nomadic culture 
among the artifacts is a fullsize suit of golden armor 
complete with headdress that was uncovered in the tomb of a 
warrior there are examples of weaponry cooking and eating 
utensils carved from wood and gourds and small wooden trunks 
the yurt a rounded tentlike structure with a wool covering to 
keep out the rain provides a look at the nomadic home life 
inside the tent is divided for men and women in the traditional 
setup 
delicate carved jewelry and a silverandgilt saddle arch and 
other ornaments also are in the display 
roaming along the eurasian steppe a grassland area ranging from 
northern china to europe the nomadic tribes thrived from 800 bc 
into the early 20th century some of the wellknown leaders were 
attila the hun and kublai khan and tamerlane descendants of 
genghis khan 
the tribes moved animal herds from pasture to pasture and 
traveled along the silk road a major trade route used to transport 
silk and other goods from china to india and the middle east 
museum officials said the nomads have been credited with helping 
develop economic trade and sharing ideas on religion art and 
technology 
they invented their own dwellings that could be transported 
from one place to another basilov said they thought about the 
possibility to make everything they possess light not heavy not 
breakable so convenient to their way of life 
among their inventions were the trousers saddles and harnesses 
for horses and bowstringed instruments the curator said 
although there still are nomads living in the soviet union and 
parts of mongolia basilov said they have settled into a more 
sedentary lifestyle such as sheepherders moving their flocks 
between permanent dwellings 
but the way of life still has the flavor of their own essence 
of culture some elders that live today remember that in their 
youth they had this way of life he said 
basilov received his doctorate in anthropology from the 
mikloukhomaclay institute of ethnography in moscow part of the 
academy of sciences of the soviet union he has held several 
positions including senior researcher and scientific secretary at 
the institute currently he heads the institutes department of 
central asian and kazakhstan research 
he believes the exhibit is unique because its message is that 
the nomads were not just barbaric tribes 
although basilov has worked on the project for more than a 
decade it still fascinates him the more you work the more 
interest you have in different fields of this very interesting 
culture

like the bubbling lava burps and smoke plumes of 
a sleepy volcano the dormant corporate takeover business is 
showing signs of preeruption life 
the biggest belch came from financier carl icahn who dumped his 
173 percent stake of texaco inc this past week for 207 billion 
cash in one behemoth trade 
it took three big wall street brokerages to handle the record 
block of 4232 million shares sold for 49 each the deal riveted 
attention on icahn and raised speculation he would use the money to 
buy or threaten to buy another big company 
a flurry of speculative buying in usx corp stock suggested that 
piggybacking investors reckoned icahn would chase the oilsteel 
giant one of his old targets he remains a significant stockholder 
in usx 
the icahn news was all the more dramatic because it came against 
the background of a slump in the mergers amp acquisitions business 
this year after a frenzy in 1988 
securities data co a research concern that follows takeover 
activity says the value of deals tumbled to 7436 billion in the 
first quarter of this year from 13717 billion a year earlier 
icahn of course declined to disclose his takeover agenda but 
the cunning investor has become known for bold and unpredictable 
moves that sometimes have stupefied followers and critics alike 
more than three years ago he outfoxed texas air corp chairman 
frank lorenzo to acquire trans world airlines later he stunned the 
airline business by making a lastminute though unsuccessful run at 
usair group inc 
contrary to widespread expectations icahn not only has kept twa 
but evidently turned it into a moneymaker he even has ordered a 
fleets worth of new airbus jetliners contradicting some union 
claims that he wouldnt invest money in twa which has some of the 
industrys oldest jetliners 
at the same time however icahn has been using twas assets to

financial analysts and investors who proclaimed 
a couple of months ago that interest rates were peaking are feeling 
pretty good about themselves right now 
since late march longterm interest rates in the government 
securities market have fallen from roughly 93 percent to 85 
percent 
as for shortterm interest rates yields on threemonth treasury 
bills have dropped over the same period from 94 percent to 86 
percent 
the nations major banks which have raised their prime lending 
rates by stages from 85 percent to 115 percent since early 1988 
now seem poised to lower them by at least half a percentage point 
all they are awaiting analysts say is the slightest signal 
from the federal reserve that it is ready to begin relaxing its 
credit policy in response to evidence that the economy has slowed 
the latest exhibit for that case came friday when the labor 
department reported employment growth of 101000 in may only about 
half of what private economists had forecast 
janet norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics 
said what expansion occurred during the month was very slow and 
limited to just a few industries 
the news helped propel the stock market to new highs since the 
1987 crash extending a rally that began last november 
the market is going up for the right reasons declared 
stephen leeb in his investment advisory letter indicator digest 
in the past two weeks evidence has begun to mount that the 
economy is decelerating in an orderly fashion making a soft 
landing an increasingly likely prospect 
michael sherman at shearson lehman hutton inc foresees this 
sort of soft landing script interest rates continue downward 
as the inflation rate settles back to an annual rate of about 4 
percent in the second half of the year 
the fed would certainly ease within the next month or so he 
added and the stock market would continue to rise outperforming 
cash instruments as investors appraised lower interest rates and a 
continued high level of corporate profits 
many investors evidently saw similar visions in the past week 
bidding up stocks to new recovery highs after a brief round of 
selling following the memorial day holiday on monday 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed friday at 
251783 up 2306 from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 218 to 
18149 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
rose 642 to 45163 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 446 at 36047 
volume on the big board averaged 19415 million shares a day up 
from 16979 million the week before 
amid the growing number of enthusiasts talking up the 
possibility of record highs in the dow before the year is out 
there are still quite a few doubters 
just suppose some ask that lower interest rates encourage the 
pace of the economy to pick up again and inflation comes back to 
haunt the markets just when that demon was supposedly subdued 
recent euphoria has tended to overlook a few unpleasant 
details says richard hoey chief economist at drexel burnham 
lambert inc 
we suspect that the antiinflationary struggle in the us is 
less of a complete victory than the current consensus believes 
before that battle is won he says rates may well climb back above 
their recent highs 
and that is likely to lead he maintains to a hard landing 
in other words a recession in 1990
