socialist parties have agreed to back 
christian democrat patricio aylwin to form a united front for 
chiles opposition in presidential elections set for december 
president augusto pinochet the general whose military government 
has ruled this south american nation since a 1973 coup has said he 
will not run for the presidency but will remain as commander of the 
army 
the army on friday threatened the use of legitimate force if 
needed to keep pinochet as its commander after the elections 
leaders of the prosocialist party for democracy and two major 
factions of the divided socialist party held ceremonies friday to 
announce their support of aylwin 70 
its not just a president we are going to elect said ricardo 
lagos head of the party for democracy we are going to elect the 
man who will rebuild a democratic system trampled by a 
dictatorship 
aylwin a lawyer and former senate president predicted victory 
in the dec 14 election his centrist christian democrats form 
chiles largest political party 
im sure we will triumph he said in a speech accepting the 
socialists support im sure we will have a government of 
democratic reconstruction 
pinochet had been expected to run for president but legal 
experts said the constitution written by his military government 
barred him because of a clause prohibiting a president from seeking 
reelection 
last tuesday pinochet publicly declared he would not be a 
candidate but he also said he would not relinquish command of the 
powerful army 
conservative and propinochet groups are split over possible 
candidates the main contenders are sergio jarpa leader of the 
centerright national renovation party and former finance minister 
hernan buchi who is pinochets choice but has not agreed to run 
the christian democrats socialists and party for democragy are 
the major forces in a 17party opposition coalition a coalition 
leader claudio vazquez said aylwin would be formally nominated on 
july 4 
leaders of the communist party and other farleft parties that 
are outside the coalition have said they will not present an 
opponent to aylwin but will run their own candidates for congress 
coalition members have been negotiating on a single slate of 
candidates for the senate and house of deputies 
aylwin said his platform will include the prosecution of those 
responsible for human rights violations during the years of military 
rule he called rights abuses an open wound that will not heal 
until the truth is discovered 
pinochet scheduled the election after voters in a referendum 
last october overwhelmingly rejected a military proposal that the 
general remain in power until 1997 the elected government is to be 
installed march 11 1990 with the president serving a fouryear 
term 
the constitution bars the new president from replacing any of the 
existing armed forces commanders for up to eight years 
a statement by the army command in santiago said friday it has 
the mission of safeguarding the constitutional order either 
through representations or in their absence through the use of 
legitimate force

the peoples liberation army which crushed 
chinas prodemocracy movement is expected to play an increasingly 
important role in civilian politics 
it was lack of army support that doomed communist party general 
secretary zhao ziyang when he challenged senior leader deng 
xiaopings condemnation of student protesters for a freer society 
now that at least 150000 soldiers are stationed in and around 
beijing to enforce martial law cultivating the army will be a 
necessity for any replacement for zhao and prospective successor to 
the 84yearold deng 
which way the army will throw its support and whether it will 
stand united behind one candidate have become key questions but 
most foreign diplomats and military experts say they can do little 
more than guess 
one problem is that normal diplomatic and military contacts have 
been interrupted by the fighting in beijing outsiders have been 
reduced to watching which generals appear on television and reading 
between the lines in their speeches 
another is that the military stands outside the political 
dichotomy of liberals and conservatives defined by their stands on 
the speed of economic reform and degree of cultural freedom the 
military has its own priorities including stability and maintaining 
a political atmosphere in which the army has high status 
political initiatives are unlikely to come from the rank and 
file many of whom are illiterate and subjected to heavy propaganda 
young officers with relatively liberal educations might support 
reformers such as zhao but have little power 
the key players will be senior officers in their 50s and 60s who 
owe their positions to deng and are desirous of promotion and 
national stability 
by and large the conservatives seem to meet their interests best 
right now although longterm stability under a leadership that 
continues to repress the citizenry is dubious 
in the latest move army propaganda chief shao huaze took over as 
editor in chief of the partys official newspaper the peoples 
daily the paper said today that shao replaced tan wenrui who 
resigned for health reasons 
zhaos problems with the military began well before weeks of 
student protests for which he expressed sympathy threw the party 
leadership into crisis 
zhao was part of chinas rising young generation of leaders 
in their 50s and 60s who unlike deng and those in their 80s were 
not army officers in the pre1949 civil war and world war ii their 
rise was interpreted as part of a natural evolution from the heavily 
ideological politics of a revolutionary leadeship toward a more 
pragmatic and even technocratic government style 
but the status and budget of the military eroded steadily under 
the new leaders as funds were shifted from defense to economic 
development deng approved the shift but it appears zhao took the 
blame 
dengs personal power base was in the red army in which he 
served as political commissar during the 1930s and 1940s when it 
fought the nationalist government and japanese invaders he made 
zhao a vice chairman of the central military commission which he 
heads and which sets military policy 
the army reportedly remained lukewarm toward zhao who was more 
comfortable meeting diplomats and playing golf than visiting the 
troops when zhao cast his vote against a crackdown on the 
protesters and publicly blamed the growing chaos on deng not one 
army official rose to zhaos support according to foreign diplomats 
there clearly was opposition to orders to shoot the crowd 
protecting the students some units sat on the sidelines throughout 
the battling and never joined in there were reports never 
confirmed of individual soldiers or small groups firing on other 
soldiers who shot civilians 
but there were no reports of units opposing the political shakeup 
or contemplating an antideng coup 
clues in the official media indicate dengs candidate to succeed 
zhao is qiao shi a member of the partys top decisionmaking group 
he also lacks a military background but he may have an alternative 
acceptable to the senior officers he is believed in charge of 
chinas internal secret service and at one point was reported to 
oversee the peoples armed police which has links to the army 
there are no indications the army is preparing to throw up its 
own candidate the military has not put forward a political 
candidate since marshal lin piao fell from grace as mao tsetungs 
prospective heir in 1971 after allegedly plotting a coup 
one lesson may be drawn from the armys performance of the past 
few weeks even in the face of the hardest choice many soldiers 
probably have ever had to make to disobey orders or to shoot at 
people who had been giving them drinks and food for days as they sat 
parked in trucks around beijing discipline and unity prevailed 
when it comes time to rally behind a successor to deng the army 
likely will act as one

a pair of worn faded overalls has caused 
a flap at city hall where the mayor wants a councilman to pay more 
attention to his appearance 
after councilman andrew jackson mcknight showed up recently at a 
city council workshop in overalls mayor david head issued a memo 
asking councilmen to dress properly when representing richwood a 
small town about 50 miles south of houston 
the memo mentions no names but head said it was directed at 
mcknight his memo does not ban jeans but asks that they be clean 
and in good shape 
while im sure that faded overalls and tshirts are 
comfortable i feel that they have no place in the council 
chambers head wrote 
hell will freeze over before i let anyone tell me how to 
dress mcknight said its nobodys business how a person 
dresses if someone wants to come down there in rags thats his 
business 
he intends to wear his overalls to the july 11 council meeting 
mcknight 54 said he has only worn overalls once since being 
elected in may and that was because he didnt have time to change 
after taking care of some goats at his farm 
but head said mcknight has shown up at city hall wearing tshirts 
with holes around the neck and cares little about his appearance 
when representing the city 
mcknight lost an election to head in 1988 but won a council post 
by a slim margin as a writein candidate in may head 50 stepped 
down from his council post to run unopposed for mayor in may

congressional leaders say newly declassified 
pentagon figures on the cost of the b2 stealth bomber bolster their 
argument against spending for the costly program 
the department of defense has produced a b2 program that wont 
fly financially rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house 
armed services committee said friday after the estimates were 
released 
members of congress are balking at spending 41 billion this 
year for sdi strategic defense initiative he said 
it is not realistic to think we can spend twice as much per 
year on a plane 
according to the pentagon the radarevading plane will cost 
about 24 billion over a threeyear peak spending period the 
estimated cost for the bomber in fiscal 1990 is 47 billion 
including 2 billion in research development testing and 
evaluation and 27 billion in production 
estimated costs in fiscal 1991 total 53 billion with costs in 
peak years of fiscal 1992 at 78 billion fiscal 1993 at 84 
billion and fiscal 1994 at 77 billion 
recent estimates have shown the aircraft will cost between 500 
million and 650 million a copy the figures released friday showed 
the pentagon has invested about 224 billion in the program and 
total cost to complete the project would be about 70 billion 
the defense department plans to purchase 132 of the planes 
including three in fiscal 1990 five in fiscal 1991 10 in fiscal 
1992 21 in fiscal 1993 and 24 in fiscal 1994 
rep charles bennett dfla a member of the house panel who had 
called for the pentagon to publicly release the cost figures on the 
aircraft said publication of the figures means will make congress 
take an even closer look 
i was shocked at the amount of money bennett said this 
early on we will look at it with more care and more scrutiny 
the full house armed services committee meets tuesday and will 
take up the 1990 national defense authorization act 
opposition to the aircraft has grown in congress with lawmakers 
arguing that production should be suspended because the bomber has 
yet to undergo flight testing 
in an appeal to defense secretary dick cheney sen john glenn 
dohio a former astronaut and test pilot said pursuing production 
of the bomber violates the rule fly before buy 
the bomber program has been buy it and then well see how it 
flies glenn said in a letter to cheney 
the defense secretary at a hearing thursday indicated initial 
tests of the aircraft would be conducted by the end of the summer 
in his fiscal 1990 budget cheney had proposed pushing back 
production of the b2 a year to 1993 
in response to glenns criticism pentagon spokesman pete 
williams said this week that cheney is thinks the b2s longrange 
capabilities and its stealth capacities make it an important 
strategic asset to the united states 
so he plans to continue right on with that and he reaffirmed 
his strong support for the b2 program williams said

senate passage of an unprecedented childcare 
package sends the debate to the house where republicans and the 
bush administration promise to fight anew for a plan without the 
billiondollar subsidies being pushed by democrats 
weve made a significant step toward providing affordable safe 
care for american children and equal economic opportunity for 
american women senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
said friday just before the measure passed on a voice vote 
with 175 billion in direct subsidies for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 and more than 2 billion a year in tax credits the 
senate package represents the greatest government effort ever to 
address childcare needs of working parents and its first major 
effort since an emergency plan adopted during world war ii 
action on child care is expected to accelerate in the house next 
week and republicans vowed to fight for legislation far different 
from the senates plan 
this is just a first step and a very short step said senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas im going to encourage the 
administration not to view what happened in the senate as final 
with the white house raising the possibility of a veto democrats 
too said they hoped to strike a compromise although they are not 
willing to abandon the subsidy approach 
we are quite willing to hear the administration to listen to 
their suggestions and their recommendations said sen edward m 
kennedy dmass 
it appeared early friday that partisan bickering would threaten a 
twoweek senate recess but republicans after losing several 
attempts to significantly change the democratic bill relented and 
struck a deal with majority democrats on a timetable to end the 
debate 
only a handful of senators remained when the measure passed the 
leadership had agreed to the voice vote so those lawmakers who had 
to catch flights out of washington would not be recorded as absent 
for the vote 
democrats characterized the legislation as historic and a 
longoverdue effort to support lowincome parents who must work but 
cannot find affordable child care 
the real winners the children are closer to a safer more 
effective and affordable childcare program said kennedy 
the measure was the product of an unusual alliance between 
liberal democrat christopher dodd of connecticut and utah republican 
orrin hatch whose conservative credentials helped democrats brush 
aside many republican attacks on the plan 
this is a monumental achievement hatch said 
despite changes designed to accommodate bush dole said the 
measure contained nothing for the president of the united states 
bush spokesman marlin fitzwater added that despite the addition 
of provisions bush favored the bill remained a candidate for a 
veto 
in addition to the 175 billion authorization for childcare 
subsidies the measure includes three taxrelief provisions designed 
to help low and moderateincome families pay for child care and 
health insurance for their children 
one would supplement the existing earned income tax credit to 
provide up to 750 more for parents whose annual incomes are less 
than 10000 and have two or more children under age 5 parents 
could receive a 500 credit for one eligible child 
the second taxrelated provision allows those who qualify for the 
existing dependent care tax credit to get 90 percent of their credit 
up front a move designed to give cash to families who are eligible 
for the credit but cannot take advantage of it because they dont 
make enough to owe federal taxes 
the third provision which republicans vigorously opposed would 
provide parents with annual incomes of less than 12000 with a tax 
credit of to 500 to pay 50 percent of the cost of buying health 
insurance for their children

two top officials in the new york regional office 
of the department of housing and urban development regularly 
solicited charitable donations from the people they regulated the 
new york times reported in its saturday editions 
some of the builders housing managers architects lawyers and 
local housing authority directors approached by joseph d 
monticciolo the previous new york hud administrator and geraldine 
mcgann the current one told the times they felt that agreeing to 
requests to buy tickets or make donations would improve their 
chances when it came to securing hud financing 
does it help you id say yes said joseph barry a builder 
in hoboken nj with several hud projects who has given generously 
its perceived as the cost of doing business with hud in the 
current political climate said robert mckay director of the 
council of large public housing authorities 
it is a violation of the federal ethics code to use public 
office or official title for private gain even if the money goes 
to charity according to mary brunette a spokeswoman for hud 
secretary jack f kemp 
no one has suggested that the money raised at the charity 
testimonials was misused 
but brunette said hud employees should not use their positions 
to solicit contributions even for a charity from the business and 
governmental community that theyre working with violations can 
result in dismissal 
monticciolo who ran the departments office that includes new 
york new jersey puerto rico and the virgin islands from 1981 to 
1988 and mrs mcgann the administrator since june 1988 did not 
respond to telephone messages left at their homes the times said

the erotic department store remains open for 
business today its supposedly sizzling saleswomen talking sex 
by phone under no less an authority than the us supreme court 
their taperecorded portrayals of sexual encounters part of a 
multibilliondollar business known as dialaporn were ruled 
constitutional within some restrictions by a unanimous high court 
friday 
the decision based on the first amendment guarantee of free 
speech rejected a federal law that sought to ban telephone 
pornography outright obscene messages can be banned the court 
said but simply indecent ones cannot 
its fantastic the first amendment will not be put down 
said gloria leonard publisher of the sex magazine high society and 
a leading dialaporn entrepreneur we feel very triumphant 
but telephone pornography opponents claimed victory too 
many many of these messages are obscene said len munsil 
lawyer for the childrens legal campaign in phoenix 
as such he said they fall under the remaining ban 
the debate began in 1983 when the courtordered breakup of the 
telephone company gave independent companies the right to operate 
information services callers pay the fee usually up to a few 
dollars on their phone bill in exchange they can hear women or 
men make suggestive comments 
the problem curious children were calling the numbers umpteen 
times racking up enormous phone bills 
parents were not amused neither were organizations such as 
munsils which has been mounting lobbying and courtroom campaigns 
to have dialaporn banned as a corrupting influence on minors 
theres no way to discriminate between adults and children in 
the listening audience said munsil and its quite clear that 
these messages are harmful to children 
beyond citing protections of free speech ms leonard pointed to 
dialaporns financial success as evidence that it meets community 
standards of acceptability at its peak a number of years ago we 
were getting half a million calls a day she said 
while ms leonard said her business is off dramatically down to 
perhaps 5000 calls a day she attributes that to a proliferation 
of competitors not any lessened interest in sex talk 
there are dozens if not hundreds of these numbers in every 
city she said this stuff has really taken off on a 
momandpop basis 
but a source in the justice department speaking on condition of 
anonymity said many of the dialaporn services appear to have 
corporate links 
the opportunity for profit is great all thats required is a 
contract with the local phone company for an information service 
number often given under the 976 exchange a switchboard 
capable of handling many calls at once and women and men willing to 
be recorded making suggestive words and noises 
some of the services provide live telephone contacts 
although complete figures havent been compiled court records 
say 180 million dialaporn calls were placed in new york in 1984 
california has 204 separate dialaporn services making up 25 
percent of its information service numbers 
nationwide the industry did an estimated 2 billion in business 
last year 
congress asked the federal communications commission to look into 
restricting dialaporn in 1983 and last year the federal lawmakers 
decided to ban the services outright 
although the court rejected the ban on messages that are only 
indecent other restrictions are possible 
diane killory the fccs general counsel said the commission 
likely will revive a plan to require access codes scrambled 
messages or credit card payment for dialaporn the principle is 
that children lacking the codes unscramblers or credit cards 
could not make the calls 
other steps are possible in california for example pacific 
bell will cut off 976 access to customers who request it and 
800000 have done so 
and the ban on obscene messages remains in effect although the 
difference between obscenity and indecency can be a difficult one to 
draw 
i dont believe that what we do is obscene ms leonard said 
and if it is its yet to be proven

malayan railway for 37 cents continue to pour in from abroad the 
transport ministry said today

including its rolling stock land buildings and trucks it also has 
debts of about 407 million

white house aides gave broad assurances 
congress was receiving relevant documents in the irancontra affair 
even though the white house had little involvement in reviewing the 
material says a senate intelligence committee report 
the report issued friday says lawyer john nields didnt learn 
until august 1987 that white house counsel hadnt been involved in 
reviewing for relevancy the national security council files of 
oliver north 
instead the white house counsels office had relied entirely on 
the fbi 
he expressed his outrage at this since he did not view this as 
sufficient compliance with congress requests said the report 
the white house representatives repeated their contention that the 
committees had in fact been given all the relevant documents in 
north office 
the 51page study concludes that white house aides made repeated 
and broad assurances that they were receiving all white house 
documents that were relevant the white house staff in fact 
had no way of knowing if other documents congress needed werent 
being selected 
the intelligence panel issued the report after looking into the 
handling of documents after six important memos were produced at the 
trial of north which the investigators had either not seen or seen 
in different versions 
the process of getting documents was very very haphazard and 
fairly chaotic said sen william cohen rmaine 
we have a situation where theres a lot of fault to go around 
on all sides said cohen rmaine vice chairman of the 
intelligence committee he was a member of the congressional panel 
which investigated the irancontra scandal in 1987 
the committee found no evidence to suggest that the documents 
relating to an arrangement under which honduras would support the 
nicaraguan contras in exchange for expedited us aid had been 
deliberately and systematically withheld by the white house 
but david boren dokla the committee chairman said he could 
never rule out completely the possibility that someone could 
have removed documents from certain files to prevent finding them in 
any of several searches 
one key memo a feb 19 1985 message to president reagan from 
thennational security adviser robert mcfarlane missed during 
document searches turned up last month in a box of papers at the 
reagan library in california the memo recommends a letter be sent 
to honduran president roberto suazo stating the united states 
deep conviction to support the contras along with a promise to 
defend honduras against any incursion from nicaragua 
the memo strongly suggests the kind of quid pro quo 
arrangement with honduras that has been denied by president bush it 
was not turned up during two searches of nsc files but was found in 
an informal heads of state file at the presidential library that 
has never been searched by investigators the report said

the battered tanker exxon valdez was pulled 
cautiously toward california today leaving behind stained 
shorelines and angry feelings from the nations worst oil spill 
i must say were not sorry to see it go gov steve cowper 
said at a news conference in juneau 
the 987foot vessel was stopped briefly for a scheduled look at 
its hull and video cameras were used to ensure that the punctured 
hull was sound before the damaged ship was towed into the often 
stormy gulf of alaska en route to a san diego drydock and more than 
25 million in repairs 
the 2500mile trip is expected to take about 20 days 
the exxon valdez rammed bligh reef on march 24 dumping almost 11 
million gallons of heavy north slope crude oil into the waters of 
prince william sound after the accident authorities pumped the 
remaining oil from the ship into other tankers 
the spill killed thousands of birds and sea mammals and spoiled 
hundreds of miles of coastline it also dealt a severe blow to 
alaskas 2 billion fishing industry forcing officials to ban 
postpone or restrict fishing 
the vessel unceremoniously lifted anchor friday and came under 
tow behind two 7000horsepower oceangoing tugboats 
a third tug was attached to the tankers stern a salvage boat 
trailed not far behind 
two escort vessels loaded with 9000 feet of containment boom and 
each carrying an oil skimming vessel with 4000 barrels capacity 
brought up the rear 
al kapp skipper of the journeyman out of california posted a 
handlettered sign on the side of his boat as he ushered the exxon 
valdez away thanks a lot exxon the sign said 
speaking by radio to a nearby media vessel kapp said fishing 
closures have hurt its disrupted my life its disrupted our 
industry 
progress initially was slow and the tanker moved only about two 
miles in the first two hours said exxon spokesman henry beathard 
the speed is expected to increase to about 5 mph 
coast guard spokeswoman brenda toledo said a light film of oil 
was reported on the water near the tanker as it got under way the 
source of the sheen was unclear she said adding not much oil is 
necessary to make a sheen were talking pints not gallons she 
said 
seven exxon officers and four salvage experts were aboard for the 
trip to san diego officials said 
the skeleton crew will monitor air pressure in the vessels cargo 
tanks conduct inspections and be ready to help with the ships 
engines should the vessel run into trouble 
exxon and the alyeska pipeline service co have been criticized 
for their slow handling of the spill during its first few days 
today oil with a sludgelike consistency can be found 700 miles 
from the reef 
the tankers former captain joseph hazelwood has pleaded 
innocent to three felony counts of criminal mischief and 
misdemeanors including negligent discharge of pollutants and 
operating a vessel while drunk he is free on 50000 bail

dorcas r hardy says she is stepping down as 
head of social security satisfied the agency she modernized and 
streamlined sometimes in the face of sharp congressional criticism 
is in good shape 
but she warns that while overall public confidence in the program 
is justifiably high policies using social security trust funds to 
underwrite other government programs and reduce the federal budget 
deficit are fueling a lack of confidence in the program by 
younger workers 
social security continues to be misunderstood by 
beneficiaries taxpayers and elected officials alike and most 
younger workers do not trust that the government will preserve 
social security for their golden years she said in her letter 
of resignation to president bush on friday 
hardy said she has confidence in the future of the social 
security program but thats not to say everybody does 
and she said many workers are discouraged by a provision 
covering the working elderly that withholds 1 for every 2 they 
earn over 8880 a year a provision she has worked to repeal 
hardy 42 had sought to remain in the social security post she 
has held for three years but told the associated press the bush 
administration indicated to her she would be replaced 
the administration is expected to nominate gwendolyn king a 
former legislative aide to sen john heinz rpa who later headed 
the office of attorney general dick thornburgh when he was governor 
of pennsylvania according to sources who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
hardy said she will leave july 31 and plans to host a weekly 
syndicated television program about finances and explore other 
options in the private sector 
hardys tenure was marked by efforts to streamline and modernize 
the agency despite declines in staffing but critics on capitol hill 
said service at the agency has deteriorated 
among the criticisms against her was that new services she 
introduced have been implemented poorly and resulted in worse 
service to the public for example a tollfree telephone service to 
provide information to individuals on their benefits has come under 
fire for a high rate of busy signals and inaccurate information is 
given to callers 
a senate committee earlier this year asked whether social 
security was violating privacy rights through its practice since 
halted of verifying millions of social security numbers for private 
companies engaged in checking credit ratings 
and a house government operations subcommittee in march began an 
inquiry into whether hardy combined business trips with vacations 
and political campaigning for members of congress 
sen david pryor dark chairman of the special senate 
committee on aging and one of hardys harshest critics in congress 
said he hoped new leadership can recapture the original spirit of 
the agency to provide compassionate service to our most vulnerable 
citizens 
but hardy said the agency now has a plan that will lead a solvent 
trust fund into the next century and the vast majority of the 
public is very pleased with the service social security provides 
a trust fund that was considered shaky before she took office now 
has enough money to pay benefits until at least the middle of the 
next century according to a social security administration report 
in april 
she takes credit for modernizing the agencys massive computer 
operations launching the 800 telephone service and providing to all 
workers social security benefit estimates upon request 
all this has been accomplished despite an imposed 20 percent 
decrease in staffing in which 63000 jobs were eliminated through 
attrition she said 
when she was named to head social security by president reagan in 
1986 she became the first woman to head the agency 
she worked for reagan on welfare issues when he was governor of 
california and she was an assistant secretary at the department of 
health and human services during his first presidential term before 
being named to the social security post

some senators are impatient with what they see 
as slow progress toward peace in el salvador and believe a cut in 
us military aid could promote a settlement with leftist guerrillas 
but the state departments top official for latin america 
bernard aronson says a sharp aid reduction would play into the 
hands of extremists and increase violence 
aronson testified friday before the senate appropriations 
subcommittee on foreign operations making his congressional debut 
as assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
most senators at the hearing expressed opposition to 
administration policy asserting that 5 billion in us aid to el 
salvador in less than a decade had produced minimal progress they 
noted the civil war in el salvador continues and argued the 
activities of rightist death squads are on the increase 
sens mark hatfield rore and tom harkin diowa said they 
would seek legislation requiring that 50 percent of the 85 million 
military aid planned for el salvador be withheld for six months 
the money will be released only if the administration certified 
the salvadoran government is making progress toward a settlement 
with leftist guerrillas 
harkin said a number of salvadorans identified with death squad 
activities who had lowered their profile for a time are now back in 
the good graces of the rightist arena party which took over the 
government three weeks ago after its electoral victory in march 
subcommittee chairman patrick leahy dvt described us policy 
toward central america as a costly bloody failure and said a 
new policy for el salvador in particular is needed 
but aronson warned against suspending aid to el salvador because 
it would cost the us influence with the government at least twice 
during the hearing he cited the precedent of guatemala recalling 
that after us military ties to that nation were suspended in 1977 
under president jimmy carter there was a marked increase in the 
number of political killings 
in the absence of a restraining us influence he said the 
guatemalan military killed everybody in sight 
aronson a democrat with a conservative foreign policy outlook 
was treated more respectfully by the subcommittee than his 
predecessor elliott abrams who alienated many lawmakers with his 
combative approach 
but aronson took strong exception to a statement by harkin that 
the administration closes its eyes and ears to the threat from the 
right in el salvador 
aronson said admonitions to salvadoran leaders for improvement in 
the protection of human rights are carried frequently by 
administration officials 
he challenged assertions by democrats on the panel that 
administration policy has produced no gains in el salvador he noted 
that despite the lack of a democratic tradition in el salvador five 
national elections have been held since 1982 and that politically 
motivated killings have dropped sharply over the years

federal engineers say crash tests of 19 cars 
show drivers of the chevrolet astro van have the greatest chance of 
head injury in an accident 
the vans manufacturer general motors corp said the federal 
tests arent a valid indicator of crashworthiness 
the astro van was among 12 vehicles listed in the third round of 
crashtest results released friday by the national highway traffic 
safety administration the vehicles were tested under nhtsas 
program to provide consumers a guide to the safety of 1989 vehicles 
results of seven other vehicles had been released previously 
gm said the federal test results do not reflect the actual 
safety performance of these vehicles on the road because the test 
is done on only one vehicle 
the vehicles were smashed at 35 mph into a fixed barrier and the 
stresses that resulted were measured by sensors on humanshaped 
dummies protected by seat belts or other crashprotection devices 
nhtsa engineers reported stresses on the head as an index called 
the head injury criterion the higher the index the greater the 
likelihood of injury 
the astro van crash test produced a head injury criterion of 
1849 for the driverside dummy in the astro van nhtsa said the 
figure was more than double the head injury criterion recorded in a 
test of the mitsubishi van the only other van tested this year 
the mitsubishi had a head injury criterion of 805 nhtsa said 
federal regulations require cars on the market to produce a head 
injury criterion no greater than 1000 in tests conducted by the 
automakers the public tests done by nhtsa and the mandatory tests 
to meet safety regulations are not considered comparable because the 
automakers tests are done at 30 mph 
other new test results by weight class produced these driver head 
injury criteria 
subcompact cars mercury tracer 4door hatchback 940 
compact cars ford probe 2door hatchback 970 
large and midsize cars chevrolet caprice 4door sedan 1328

nhtsa said small differences in test results arent considered 
significant

congressional leaders are pressing president 
bush for tough action against china but the white house is appealing 
for patience saying it will be a long time before washington and 
beijing return to normal relations 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush in a 
meeting with senators friday asked for their understanding that 
he was trying to do the best job possible to express the concerns of 
the united states government the outrage of american people in 
terms of what they had seen there and at the same time to preserve 
our relations as best we could 
sen joseph biden ddel said bush asked for our patience and 
forbearance 
chinese authorities this week executed 27 people charged with 
taking part in prodemocracy demonstrations 
on capitol hill calls continued for a stronger white house 
response sen robert c byrd dwva said i believe the 
president must take tough action and block trade with and new 
investments in china right now he added that there are some 
values which take precedence over commerce 
the stark barbarism of the communist regime is unforgivable to 
all civilized people byrd said 
the dust has settled on the blood of peaceful demonstrators 
and the regime wantonly spills fresh blood on top of old it 
executes its young on the altar of old mens egos and fears america 
cannot possibly be in the position of rewarding appearing to 
reward or in any way countenance these acts byrd added 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine who has called 
on bush to be more forceful in denouncing the chinese governments 
actions attended the white house meeting but did not speak to 
reporters afterwards 
at the white house biden said bush did not suggest lawmakers 
should mute their criticism of his policy and he made it very 
clear that he believed that it was appalling what was happening in 
china in terms of human rights 
he quoted bush as saying there was a long road that was going 
to have to be traveled in that relationship and that we shouldnt 
move precipitously 
fitzwater said bush in referring to a long road was talking 
about the events that have taken place there and the amount of 
time that anyone can foresee before we would have a return to a 
normalcy or anything like we had before 
unlike some of his congressional colleagues biden withheld 
criticism or suggestions about bushs policy 
i dont believe that we should suggest to the president 
precisely what he should do biden said i think what we should 
do is make it clear to the president and make it clear to the 
chinese that there isnt any option that is beyond consideration 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio said i think the president was 
saying that its very simple to take a precipitous action break 
relations with china but the longrange interests of the united 
states require delicate appropriate judgmental handling of the 
situation 
sen john kerry dmass said the acts of the chinese government 
against its own citizens must be met by an unrelenting and 
unmistakable willingness to change immediately and significantly the 
status quo of our relationship 
the bullets aimed at prodemocracy students workers and 
teachers are also aimed at us kerry said each shot that takes 
a life when met by silence indifference or sense of impotence 
also takes with it a piece of who we are and what we are supposed to 
stand for

a 12foot bronze sculpture of a blackfoot 
indian chief with outstretched arms welcomes visitors to the 
eiteljorg museum of american indian and western art he carries no 
weapon only a feather in his right hand 
harrison eiteljorg would not have it any other way 
in this museum you will not see one battle scene said 
eiteljorg whose voluminous private collection becomes public when 
the museum opens today 
the indians had a beautiful art or religion whatever you want 
to call it they worshiped the sun the rain their crops and 
fields they never killed except for their own needs i wanted the 
museum to show that it has a romantic feeling about the western 
indians and their life 
the museums collection of primarily 20th century paintings and 
bronzes chronicles the westward movement of american settlers and 
the indians way of life 
eiteljorgs collection is among the best displays of southwestern 
art in the nation said dean krakel former director of the cowboy 
hall of fame in oklahoma city 
he bought early and he bought well before the boom in 
prices he said 
the best of the eiteljorg collection centers on the taos ten a 
colony of artists founded by joseph henry sharp that settled in 
taos nm 
from sharps colorful oil taos indians to victor higgins 
the blue shawl each is a memento of eiteljorgs many visits to 
taos and the southwest 
the collection also includes works by more wellknown western 
artists such as charles m russell frederic s remington and 
georgia okeeffe 
other artists featured in the museum are thomas moran whose 
watercolors were used to lobby congress to create yellowstone 
national park and alfred jacob miller the earliest known artist to 
paint the american fur traders during their heyday 
eiteljorg who studied art at indiana university and whose 
germanborn mother was an artist married the daughter of a southern 
indiana coal company owner and later took over the business 
the fortune he amassed in coal and real estate allowed him and 
his second wife sonja to acquire their vast art holdings it 
includes an impressive collection of african art and costumes which 
will go on permanent display at the indianapolis museum of art in 
1990 
his western art however was too significant to place within 
another museums walls 
city and state leaders invited eiteljorg four years ago to build 
a museum on the outskirts of white river state park just west of 
downtown indianapolis a 125 million grant from lilly endowment 
and 15 million from eiteljorg financed its development and 
construction 
the 25000 square feet of gallery space house a rotating exhibit 
of eiteljorgs 240 western paintings 149 bronzes and 740 indian 
artifacts mostly from the southwest plains and the northwest coast 
indian cultures 
michael duty the museums executive director said his goals 
include developing the museum into a repository and research 
facility for woodlands indians who once roamed indiana and 
surrounding states 
we must also become spokespersons for trying to protect indian 
burial sites trying to afford them the kind of respect that i think 
they have not always gotten he said 
perhaps the museums most significant contribution is the respect 
it demands of western paintings and sculptures long considered the 
backwater of american art duty said 
western imagery is so pervasive in advertising movies and 
television that people find it hard not to get the two confused 
he said western art has a real place in american art

the supreme court has left separate messages 
for congress and sexually oriented telephone services to congress 
you cant kill dialaporn to the multibilliondollar industry 
clean up your act 
the courts unanimous decision friday said congress went too far 
last year when it passed a law banning all sexually oriented phone 
message services 
only obscene messages not messages that merely are indecent 
may be outlawed the court said it said a blanket ban would violate 
freespeech rights 
a phone conversation like an explicit movie or centerfold in an 
adult magazine may or may not be obscene thats for a jury to 
decide on a casebycase basis 
material deemed to be indecent rather than obscene is protected 
under the constitution 
the court acknowledged that congress has a legitimate interest in 
preventing children from being exposed to even indecent messages 
but the justices said they are unpersuaded nothing less than a total 
ban will prevent kids from gaining access to such messages 
in other decisions the court 
ruled 54 in a virginia case that states are not obligated to 
provide free lawyers for death row inmates who lost an initial round 
of appeals 
said by an 81 vote the justice department has a legal 
obligation under the freedom of information act to supply a weekly 
tax magazine with copies of all federal trial court opinions and 
orders in tax cases 
made it more difficult by a 72 vote in an ohio case for older 
workers to prove their employers are guilty of illegal age bias in 
the handling of pensions and other fringe benefits 
in the dialaporn case the court said the federal 
communications commissions effort to use technology to restrict 
dialaporn messages to adults might work resulting in only a few 
of the most enterprising and disobedient young people gaining 
access to such messages 
paul maurer a spokesman for the cincinnatibased national 
coalition against pornography urged people to pressure telephone 
companies to drop dialaporn services 
the ruling maurer said gives citizens a chance to really 
speak out whether they want this stuff in their community 
the ruling does not directly affect any states regulation of the 
dialaporn business but state laws deemed too similar to the 
federal law could be challenged on the same constitutional grounds 
the court rejected industry arguments that the disputed law 
impermissibly imposes a national standard for what is obscene based 
on the least tolerant community 
the argument is that a phone message originating in a city such 
as new york which tolerates numerous sexually explicit businesses 
could be prosecuted and judged under the community standards of a 
small town in rural america 
the court said thats a problem with which the dialaporn 
industry itself must wrestle 
the courts three most liberal justices in freedomofexpression 
cases william j brennan thurgood marshall and john paul stevens 
voted to strike down the federal law even as it applies to obscene 
material 
dialaporn companies make their services available to callers 
through 976 exchanges 
the telephone company typically charges callers according to 
percall rates retaining a portion of the charges and giving the 
rest to the dialaporn company 
the same 976 exchanges also are used for other noncontroversial 
types of messages such as sports scores time checks and weather 
reports 
born in 1983 the dialaporn industry matured quickly by 1984 
according to court records some 180 million calls were placed by 
customers in new york alone the industry reportedly topped 2 
billion in income last year

activists commemorated the murders 25 years ago 
of three young civil rights workers by vowing to fight in their 
spirit to strengthen voter registration and reverse the effects of 
supreme court decisions on affirmative action 
but relatives of the slain workers said they were disappointed 
president bush did not commit himself to new civil rights 
legislation 
bush told family members of michael schwerner and andrew goodman 
both white new yorkers and james chaney a black mississippian 
that the men killed by ku klux klansmen in philadelphia miss were 
heroes 
we can erect no greater monument to their memory than to ensure 
that the arrogance and bigotry that took their lives never again 
exists in america bush said in a statement released at the white 
house 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president is 
waiting for a justice department review of the new supreme court 
rulings before making any commitment to action 
the families were on a bus caravan from philadelphia miss to 
washington and new york to commemorate the june 21 1964 
disappearance of the men who had been conducting a black voter 
registration drive in neshoba county 
their bulletriddled bodies were found buried in an earthen dam 
near philadelphia miss and the fbi found that the ku klux klan 
had killed them 
rita schwernerbender who was married to schwerner told 
reporters she was disappointed bush was noncommittal when they asked 
him to back bipartisan legislation to deal with the supreme court 
cases that have so badly eroded civil rights in this country 
at a ceremony at the capitol she charged the justice department 
the supreme court and congress stand in the way of a suitable and 
fitting memorial to those who participated in the civil rights 
struggle 
so long as the justice department argues before the supreme 
court for a narrowing of the laws so long as the congress and 
the president fail to commit themselves to the needs of the poor 
housing education medical assistance there is no honor shown to 
the civil rights participants she said 
ben chaney brother of the slain james chaney told about 300 
people in the capitols statuary hall we have to remember they 
didnt volunteer to die 
we need immediate passage of federal legislation that 
eliminates all the barriers to voting chaney said 
this present majority on the supreme court is far more 
dangerous than bull connor with a fire hose said benjamin hooks 
executive director of the naacp referring to the birmingham ala 
city officials actions against civil rights demonstrators 
hooks also vowed legislative remedies to reverse supreme court 
rulings or well have demonstrations thatll make what happen in 
china look like childs play he said raising the threat of 
thousands of protestors converging on the capital

this weekend to decide whether dutch brewery tycoon alfred h 
heineken can tear down a 70yearold villa surrounding his 
multimilliondollar piedaterre at this luxury resort

allow him to tear down the villa and replace it with an annex to his 
own place

an austrian industrialist by renowned german architect heinrich 
tessenow in 1917 is a bunker and a revolting yellow 
monstrosity 
hans rutishauser chief curator of monuments of grisons the 
canton that includes st moritz has said the villa is unique and 
original and should come under official protection

an oil tanker hit an offshore rock friday 
afternoon and leaked about 1 million gallons of heating oil into the 
atlantic ocean the coast guard said 
the 560foot tanker world prodigy carrying 76 million gallons 
of no 2 heating oil struck a rock at brenton reef immediately 
south of newport at 440 pm said petty officer ellen harrington 
of the coast guard office in boston 
the ship bound for providence was pulled off the rock almost 
immediately and anchored nearby the leak was stopped at about 910 
pm after about 1 million gallons of oil had leaked harrington 
said 
the navy began replacing booms around the ship which sails under 
a greek flag with a containment curtain shortly after 10 pm 
theyll determine overnight what the immediate environmental 
concerns are and place booms around those areas she said 
like a boom the plastic curtain is deployed around the spill 
with its bottom weighted to keep it under water and its top 
suspended by buoys to contain the oil 
some of the oil was washing up on castle hill beaches early 
saturday said gov edward d diprete 
he said the ships captain told him he had made a mistake in not 
having a pilot on board and also in plotting the course 
president bush sent environmental protection agency administrator 
william reilly interior secretary manuel lujan and other white 
house advisers to the scene early saturday and they met diprete 
shortly after midnight and planned to tour the affected area 
arthur markos dipretes chief of staff said state officials are 
considering legal action but plan no criminal charges our bay is 
very important to us were a very small state he said 
michael a annarummo deputy director of the state department of 
environmental management said coast guard divers had reported 
finding two huge holes in the ship 
theres a long 150foot knifelike gash and divers are now 
talking about a wider gash lower on the ship annarummo said 
annarummo said state officials were confident they had enough 
booms to contain the spill and said it was a lucky that the spill 
was heating oil 
its a light fuel oil annarummo said the plus of that is 
you dont get the heavy staining or coating or adhesion it breaks 
up easier and evaporates 
harrington said the slick was moving east parallel to the shore 
and away from the mouth of narragansett bay but annarummo said 
sensitive wildlife areas in the bay could be in danger by morning 
that tides going to change on us he said 
there were no immediate reports of injuries or harm to wildlife 
the coast guard said the ship is owned by ballard shipping but 
did not know who owns the cargo 
brenton reef a nautical landmark where americas cup yacht races 
were held for many years is within sight of the shore and of the 
main shipping route into narragansett bay the cause of the accident 
was not known she said 
coast guard lt alan brown said the spill should be a lot easier 
to contain than the crude oil spill that devastated alaskas prince 
william sound last winter when the tanker exxon valdez struck a rock 
near the port of valdez 
with any luck at all the seas are calm enough that well be 
able to boom all around it brown said nothing like alaska 
where it got out of hand before anyone was there 
because the site is in the populous northeast it will take much 
less time to get booms and cleanup equipment into place he said 
the odor of the spilled oil wafted through this affluent resort 
city boy its enough to knock you off your feet said rhode 
island secretary of state kathleen s connell who lives near the 
shore in suburban middletown 
the alaska spill occurred march 23 when the tanker exxon valdez 
ran aground on bligh reef a wellmarked navigation hazard about 25 
miles south of valdez the 987foot tanker had just picked up a full 
load of 113 million gallons of oil at valdez the northernmost 
icefree port in the united states and the southern terminus of 
alaska pipeline 
at one point the tanker was spilling 20000 gallons of oil per 
hour into pristine prince william sound 
exxon later fired the tankers captain joseph hazelwood after 
tests revealed his blood alcohol level was above legal limits more 
than nine hours after the accident he faces criminal charges 
including reckless endangerment and operating a vessel while drunk 
exxon later was criticized because no containment booms were put 
around the tanker until more than 11 hours after the wreck 
bush initially rejected requests by alaska officials to 
federalize the cleanup efforts insisting that exxon could do the 
job but on april 7 he ordered the military to join the cleanup 
effort

a driftnet fishing agreement between the 
united states and japan averted a us embargo of japanese fishery 
imports but sparked criticism in congress 
the commerce department announced the oneyear agreement friday 
days before a june 29 deadline 
rep jolene unsoeld dwash called the pact disappointing sen 
frank murkowski ralaska said he had serious doubts about the 
agreement 
it certainly isnt the agreement we were looking for said 
unsoeld a member of the house marine and fisheries committee i 
think our fishermen had hoped for a lot more 
piracy of our fish will continue said rep john miller 
rwash also a member of the fisheries panel pointing to 
evidence of past behavior 
the japanese use the nets for squid drift nets are smallmesh 
nets that can stretch more than 30 miles long hanging in the water 
and snaring virtually any mammal bird or fish that comes in 
contact officials said that on any given day the nets can cover 
more than 30000 miles of ocean 
the commerce department has said the nets poses a threat to the 
marine environment and the west coast us fishing industry 
the oneyear agreement confirmed in an exchange of letters 
between commerce and state department negotiators and the japan 
fishing agency calls for some monitoring of the japanese fishing 
fleet in the north pacific 
but japan is not required to make any commitment about revising 
or curtailing its use of drift nets 
this agreement achieves a real commitment rather than a vague 
promise that major advances in japanese fleet monitoring and 
enforcement will take place on a multiyear basis commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher said in a statement 
if this progress is reflected in results we will have achieved 
an important balance between our fishing trading relationship and 
our environmental responsibilities 
greenpeace spokesman alan reichman said from seattle that the 
environmental group was concerned that this deal simply isnt 
going to go far enough in setting the level of observer 
participation and other measures that would set a foundation for a 
ban in the future 
brian gorman spokesman for the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration said japan as recently as last month was unwilling 
to accept any proposal he said the settlement was hastened by the 
threat of trade sanctions against japan along with south korea and 
taiwan on fishery products imported into the united states 
the drift net act of 1987 gave the commerce secretary until june 
29 to reach an agreement 
under the agreement up to four research fishing vessels will be 
allowed to accompany japanese fishing fleets which consist of about 
460 vessels 
the research vessels three from japan and one from canada 
will be equipped with transmitters so data can be collected to 
determine who catches what and where gorman said 
japanese and american observers also will be placed on japanese 
vessels so the location of the vessels can be determined

here are highlights of the childcare packaged 
passed friday by the senate changes are likely when the house takes 
up the bill 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the legislation authorizes 175 billion in federal subsidies for 
child care in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 money that still 
must be appropriated seventy percent of the money would have to be 
used to help parents pay for child care twentytwo percent is 
earmarked for state programs such as grants to and training of 
childcare providers the remaining 8 percent would be used for 
states to administer the programs states which certified that 
availability of child care was more of a problem than affordability 
could reduce to 65 percent the amount for parents and increase to 27 
percent the amount used on state programs

there are three tax breaks for lowincome and moderateincome 
families 
child health credit parents with annual incomes of less than 
12000 could receive a tax credit of up to 500 to help pay the 
cost of health insurance for their children families with annual 
incomes of 12000 to 18000 would get a smaller credit this 
credit would first be available in 1991 
refundable dependent care credit beginning in 1992 families 
who now are eligible for the existing dependent care tax credit 
could receive 90 percent of their credit up front through monthly 
installments in their paychecks refundable means the measure is 
designed to provide the money to families who are eligible but do 
not get to take advantage of the credit currently because they do 
not make enough to owe any federal income taxes against which the 
credit would be applied 
supplemental earned income tax credit the existing credit would 
provide families with annual incomes of less than 10000 with a 
500 credit for a child under the age of 5 and a 750 credit if they 
have two or more eligible children the credit available beginning 
in 1991 would be phased out for families with annual incomes in the 
1000015000 range

line with guidelines included in the measure these include 
firstaid and other training of childcare providers and inspections 
of institutional childcare settings immediate family members of 
children who provide child care for them are exempt from any state 
training requirements also social security recipients would have 
any childcare earnings exempted from outside earnings limitations

the federal aviation administration is taking 
action to stop airline manufacturers from placing exit doors too far 
apart 
the association of flight attendants praised fridays order 
which limits doors to within 60 feet apart saying it will stop 
boeing plans to remove middle doors over the wings of future jumbo 
jets 
but a boeing spokesman in seattle david jimenez said the 
aircraft builder already has abandoned any plans that would put exit 
doors in its planes further than 60 feet apart 
the faa said its order will hold the line on the growth of 
distances between airliner exit doors noting that one unidentified 
model was planned with exits more than 80 feet apart 
the new regulations published in fridays edition of the federal 
register take effect in 30 days and apply to all newly 
manufactured airplanes of older type designs after oct 16 1987 
when the rule was first proposed the faa said 
the rule also will prevent any modification of existing designs 
that would increase the distance between doors beyond 60 feet and 
prohibit us airlines from using foreign airplanes that have exit 
distances exceeding the new standard the agency said 
the faa said it is forming an advisory committee to set standards 
based on how quickly passengers can exit from the doors rather than 
on arbitrary distances between doors the committee is to make 
recommendations by july 1991 
the flight attendants group in a prepared statement said 
boeings plans would have created a 72foot distance between some of 
the planes exit doors 
the association had urged congress to save 747 exits over the 
wing saying passengers in many crashes have been unable to reach 
exits in postcrash fires 
jimenez said boeing had planned to remove two of the 10 exit 
doors on new 747s but abandoned the plan prior to the faa order he 
said the new order would not affect any boeing model 
previous faa rules have required require at least one exit door 
for every 55 seats 
the faa said all narrowbody airplanes and most widebody planes 
already conform to the new distance limit

a ball bearing manufacturer has agreed to pay 
the government 143 million to settle claims the company 
overcharged the pentagon and the connecticut man who initiated the 
charges will get a more than 1 million slice of the settlement 
the justice department said friday that george g butenkoff a 
former regional salesman for industrial tectonics inc of dexter 
mich will receive 142795240 
under a provision of the false claims act individuals can bring 
fraud suits on behalf of themselves and the government and are 
entitled to a percentage of any money the government receives 
justice department spokeswoman amy brown said butenkoffs 
settlement award is the largest of its type since the law was 
revamped in 1986 
butenkoff of east windsor conn did not return repeated 
telephone messages friday 
butenkoff filed suit in november 1985 in us district court in 
hartford conn accusing industrial tectonics of overcharging pratt 
amp whitney aircraft for ball bearings delivered to the air force and 
overcharged westinghouse for bearings used in nuclear reactors by 
the navy the military received the hardware between 1979 and 1985 
the justice department said 
the government joined the suit in january 1986 and 
investigations by defense contract audit agency supported the 
claims the department said 
robert l way a spokesman for axel johnson inc a new york 
company that purchased industrial tectonics in december 1982 said 
most of the alleged overcharges occurred before the company was sold 
and all came before axel johnson changed management at the michigan 
plant 
way said butenkoff filed the suit after he was fired but he 
declined to discuss the circumstances around the dismissal 
way also said the settlement in large part comes from the 
former owner whom he declined to identify 
the justice department said other claims against industrial 
tectonics remain and will be resolved in administrative proceedings 
the department said those claims are expected to bring the 
government more than 6 million 
way said the company denies the remaining claims

the bush administration will continue with its 
cautious approach towards iran despite concern about the improvement 
in relations between the moslem fundamentalist nation and the soviet 
union 
we and others will find it difficult to understand efforts to 
move close to a regime that continues to support international 
terrorism and hostagetaking state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler said 
we are watching closely the evolution of the soviet 
relationship with iran she said 
iran and the soviet union ended almost a decade of chilly 
relations by signing a longterm cooperation pact friday with the 
possibility that an arms deal may follow 
the pact was signed at the end of a visit to moscow by the 
speaker of irans parliament hashemi rafsanjani a communique 
issued by both sides said the two nations agreed to build and 
develop good neighborly relations on the principles of equality 
rafsanjani the acting commander of irans armed forces is the 
highest ranking iranian official to visit moscow since the 1979 
revolution that crushed the iranian communist party and sent mobs 
into the streets shouting death to america death to russia 
a senior us official told journalists friday he thought the 
soviets were reverting to type in their dealings with iran 
the official who refused to allow his name or title to be used 
explained he believes the soviet moves harkened back to a tendency 
to try to take advantage of western governments 
the united states severed relations with iran in 1980 five 
months after militants seized the us embassy in tehran president 
bush has said iran must renounce terrorism and help free americans 
held hostage in lebanon before relations can be resumed 
secretary of state james a baker iii told the house foreign 
affairs committee this week the united states is concerned about 
the possibility of weapons transfers 
we indicated our concern across the whole spectrum of questions 
involving proliferation of missiles and chemical technology baker 
said about his meeting in moscow last month with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
he said us policy toward iran would be guided by developments 
in that nation not by irans relationship with the soviet union

the senate angered over this weeks supreme 
court ruling that burning the american flag is constitutionally 
protected free speech passed legislation aimed at making 
desecration of the flag unlawful 
sen joseph biden ddel had the measure tacked onto an 
unrelated child care bill late friday 
im confident its constitutional biden chairman of the 
senate judiciary committee and a leading congressional liberal told 
his colleagues 
the move in the senate came as several lawmakers introduced 
constitutional amendments in the house following the supreme court 
decision house speaker thomas s foley dwash said such attempts 
should be taken cautiously and that it would be extraordinarily 
slow to amend the first amendment to the constitution which is 
at the heart of our constitutional liberties and freedom 
biden said his simple legislation could accomplish the same aim 
as a constitutional amendment 
the bill reads whoever knowingly and publicly mutilates 
defaces burns displays on the floor or ground or tramples upon 
any flag of the united states shall be fined not more than 1000 or 
imprisoned for not more than one year or both 
bidens bill is identical to the federal statute on flag 
desecration except it removes the words cast contempt 
the majority supreme court opinion reasoned that a texas statute 
on flag desecration violated the first amendment because it was 
aimed at protecting against acts toward the flag which would be 
offensive to others bidens measure would treat desecration as an 
act of vandalism without considering whether anyone was offended by 
the act presumably answering the courts first amendment concerns 
the house may consider next week a resolution similar to the one 
passed by the senate this week expressing opposition to the view of 
the court 
rep henry hyde of illinois a senior republican on the house 
judiciary committee said he was also exploring ways of getting 
around the decision without a constitutional amendment possibly by 
taking away from the supreme court jurisdiction over lawsuits on 
flag desecration 
i think the mood of the house is to do something effective and 
not just pass resolutions condemning the burning of the flag he 
said a new law would be simpler than a constitutional amendment he 
said

soviet union and the oppressive economic system senior leader deng 
xiaoping has tried to reform those who have died for freedom in 
china will truly have died in vain nixon said in an article

bingzhang to court over bank transactions the rift has kept china 
spring on the sidelines during the student protests that culminated

founded by wang in 1983 the group has been dogged by controversy 
throughout its existence members of the standing committee often 
change and critics frequently accuse it of accepting funds from 
taiwans ruling party the kuomintang

china to smuggle out manuscripts by fang and some of chinas leading 
political prisoners giving the group stature at its zenith china 
spring claimed 50 branches on five continents

cardinal timothy manning a champion of the 
poor and oppressed during his 15 years as roman catholic archbishop 
of los angeles has died of spinal cancer at 79 
he died friday at the norris cancer hospital of the university of 
southern california said aj antczak managing editor of the 
tidings the diocesan newspaper 
mannings successor archbishop roger mahony was at mannings 
side when he died we were praying the litany of saints when he 
peacefully slipped away mahony said 
mahony who compared mannings life to that of father junipero 
serra the 18th century priest who founded the missions in 
california said it was as if we were just adding his name to that 
long list of heroic and saintly men and women to whom we commended 
his spirit 
a native of ireland manning arrived in the united states in 
1928 although he retired as archbishop in 1985 he observed the 
55th anniversary of his ordination as a priest on friday antczak 
said 
manning was a man of great strength courage and compassion 
former president reagan said in a statement he enriched the life 
of thousands who are better because of his good work 
mayor tom bradley ordered flags at city buildings flown at 
halfstaff in mannings honor 
manning after serving two years as a bishop in fresno became 
archbishop in 1970 taking over from cardinal james francis 
mcintyre whose final years in los angeles were filled with discord 
in 1970 minority catholics complained of alienation weekly 
during protests in front of st basils catholic church 
young priests and nuns often found themselves at odds with the 
hierarchy and quietly referred to the chancery as the fortress 
manning moved his residence to st vibianas church in the skid 
row section of los angeles he established ministries for blacks and 
hispanics and began a priests senate to give the clergy greater 
say an interparochial council extended the participation to the 
parish level 
manning also visited with local protestant and jewish 
congregations 
he assured vietnam war protesters they could declare themselves 
conscientious objectors and often spoke against the nuclear arms 
race saying in 1981 the cry of the poor for bread has been 
answered by warheads 
in 1983 he petitioned then secretary of state george shultz to 
halt the deportation of salvadoran refugees 
his social liberalism was matched by a theological conservatism 
he denounced abortion as murder and announced that any catholic who 
cooperated in an abortion would be excommunicated from the church 
bishop john ward who served as mannings auxiliary bishop said 
of manning he was an outstanding princely gentleman the perfect 
priest who was devoted to his work with priests and people alike 
after ordination in 1934 he went to rome for postgraduate 
studies at the gregorian institute in rome he received a doctor of 
canon law degree in 1938

the seabrook nuclear power plant has 
suspended lowpower testing indefinitely after federal regulators 
shut down the reactor because of a malfunctioning valve 
rep edward j markey dmass a leading seabrook opponent said 
friday that top nuclear regulatory commission regional officials 
told him an nrc official had to grab a control room operator to get 
him to shut down the reactor thursday 
what we have here is a situation where the seabrook reactor 
operators were not able to follow their own procedures and an nrc 
official in the control room first having given a verbal 
instruction had to physically grab one of the seabrook operators to 
ensure that procedures would be followed to shut the plant down 
immediately markey said in a telephone interview 
that didnt happen seabrook spokesman rob williams said 
williams said operators already were aware of the problem when 
the nrc official spoke up and three minutes later decided to shut 
down the reactor no one was grabbed he said 
the commission believes operators waited several minutes too 
long before shutting down the reactor at 1236 pm thursday plant 
executive edward brown said in a statement 
we did not strictly adhere to our test procedures in response 
to temperature and pressure changes in various systems brown said 
at no time was there a risk to plant systems or the general 
public seabrook spokesman ron sher said 
nrc spokesman frank ingram said seabrooks lowlevel testing 
license is not affected by the incident and the commission wont 
say operators made a mistake 
ingram said brown agreed that the plant will delay resumption of 
lowpower tests until operators pinpoint why the valve malfunctioned 
in the nonnuclear area make any necessary repairs and review the 
actions with nrc staff 
ingram said he had no idea how long the process would take 
a decade behind schedule the bitterly contested plant won 
permission to conduct lowpower tests earlier this month the tests 
began june 13 and had been running smoothly 
dianne dunfey a member of the antiseabrook clamshell alliance 
said her group thinks the situation is more serious than seabrook or 
federal officials have said 
our feeling is that for the nrc characteristically 
irresponsible in their handling of problems of this nature to take 
this step indicates a very serious breach by operators dunfey 
said 
gov judd gregg said he was undisturbed by the situation 
it is also reassuring to know that the nrc is taking the 
necessary steps to ensure safe operations if appropriate procedures 
at the plant were not followed he said

abducted at random and tortured 
circuit judge michael zoghby gave benjamin franklin cox jr the 
maximum prison sentence friday calling the 1981 beating and hanging 
death of a 19yearold michael donald a heinous senseless 
killing 
the punishment should fit the crime he said 
cox a 28yearold truck driver was convicted of murder may 18 
as an accomplice in the donald killing another klansman was 
convicted of murder earlier and sentenced to death a third pleaded 
guilty to federal civil rights charges and became a prosecution 
witness a fourth awaits trial 
a lawsuit stemming from donalds death resulted in a landmark 
judgment that bankrupted one klan organization the united klans of 
america the 7 million judgment was assessed by a federal court 
jury in a lawsuit filed by donalds mother beulah mae donald she 
died last year 
donald was chosen at random from a city street and slain in a kkk 
revenge plot on march 21 1981 according to testimony

another klansman to provide the 22caliber pistol used in donalds

and sentence he told the judge cox was a model father a model 
citizen who has led an exemplary life 
although cox did not participate in the killing and had no prior 
criminal convictions district attorney chris galanos said to place 
him on probation would be a sham and a slap in the face of every 
black human being in this country 
zoghby said he understood that coxs role was limited but 
he said the whole incident itself was a heinous senseless crime 
that bespeaks of a page in history best to be put behind us never

like to say im not guilty of murder 
handcuffed and led away by deputies cox kissed his wife gail 
his mother collapsed in her husbands arms crying oh god

meeting on march 18 1981 where killing a black was suggested 
local klansmen were angered over a mistrial in the case of a black 
man charged in the slaying of a white birmingham police sergeant

gun shop operators are having trouble keeping gun 
locks and safety boxes in stock following passage of a bill that 
could send adults to jail for leaving guns within childrens reach 
the florida legislature was called into special session this week 
after a string of accidental shootings left three children dead the 
shootings reversed longstanding opposition to toughening the 
states liberal gun laws 
we used to sell maybe four or five trigger locks for every 100 
guns said ray ribas assistant manager at tamiami gun and range 
shops in miami now it seems everyone wants one 
gun locks work by immobilizing the trigger some consist only of 
plastic straps while lockandkey units sell for 8 to 12 some 
gun owners are opting for more costly vaults with a key or 
combination lock 
theres a whole new awareness about guns and that can only 
lead to less accidents said ribas 
wjnoam in west palm beach distributed more than 500 gun locks 
free last week at two shopping malls 
people have been calling the station asking where they can get 
more said wjno producer rebecca wynne people are very aware of 
the new law 
southern gun and tackle a floridabased nationwide gun 
distributor said gun lock orders have more than doubled in the past 
month 
weve proposed to the dealers that they offer the lock with 
every gun they sell said al russell manager of the companys 
purchasing department 
under the statute gun owners who fail to secure loaded weapons 
in homes or businesses could face a thirddegree felony charge if a 
child 15 years old or younger shoots someone the charge carries a 
maximum prison sentence of five years and a 5000 fine 
lesser penalties would apply if the child brandishes the gun in 
public or threatens others with the weapon 
the bill was drafted with the help of the national rifle 
association and would take effect oct 1 once signed by gov bob 
martinez police officers and military personnel are exempted as are 
cases in which the guns were obtained illegally such as a burglary 
a call for similar guncontrol action was made friday by 
wisconsin lt gov scott mccallum following shootings involving 
children in that state 
master lock co one of the nations largest gun lock makers 
distributes 220000 to 250000 locks each year said spokesman tom 
campbell at the companys milwaukee headquarters he said sales were 
increasing 
unfortunately sales increases often follow catastrophes such 
as accidental shootings he said 
ive always encouraged my customers to buy trigger locks it 
took killings to convince some people they are really needed said 
buddy cook manager of gunrunner inc in tallahassee 
at wain roberts firearms in st petersburg clerk darin paulton 
said a case of 24 trigger locks used to last about six months 
weve sold four cases since word of the law first came out 
he said these things sold very sparingly before now they are 
really moving

the pittston coal group inc has 
rejected an offer by the governor to mediate negotiations in an 
attempt to end the 2monthold united mine workers strike 
west virginia gov gaston caperton issued the invitation friday 
to umw president richard trumka and paul douglas head of pittston 
coal groups parent company to mediate the strike talks 
the umw accepted the offer within hours of capertons speech at a 
national coal association meeting but douglas declined the 
invitation friday night asking the governor instead to urge umw 
leaders to halt the strike 
douglas said pittston could not accept a condition caperton had 
set for the talks at his mansion the governor had asked coal 
companies to promise not to ship coal for pittston while it is 
engaged in the negotiations 
such interference with business relationships can play no 
constructive role in any attempt to resolve the dispute and is in 
fact counterproductive douglas said 
douglas also said collective bargaining mediated by the federal 
mediation and conciliation service from which the umw withdrew june 
7 was the proper forum for resolving the strike 
caperton set three other conditions for the talks that both 
sides negotiate in good faith that more than 44000 miners in 10 
states end wildcat strikes and that legal action against the union 
be dropped 
the umwa welcomes gov capertons offer to play a positive role 
in ending this dispute trumka said as i have repeatedly said 
i am ready to go anywhere at any time to meet with paul douglas and 
his management team to negotiate a mutually beneficial end to the 
unions dispute with pittston 
about 1900 umw workers in virginia and west virginia went on 
strike against pittston on april 5 when the company imposed a 
contract after 14 months of fruitless negotiations it requires 
overtime and sunday work and cuts medical benefits to retirees 
after a june 11 rally at the west virginia capitol which 
caperton attended wildcat strikes began spreading through coal 
country idling 44000 workers in 10 states 
the walkout continued mostly unabated friday despite several 
companies winning backtowork court orders against umw members 
whose contracts forbid sympathy strikes 
us district judge dennis knapp in charleston postponed separate 
hearings for five companies who asked that the umw and its members 
be held in contempt for ignoring backtowork orders 
union lawyer chuck donnelly said the judge suggested the 
postponement because of the logistical problems of 18 separate 
hearings in one day and indicated he wanted to give the umw and 
pittston time to consider capertons proposal 
a federal court in virginias western district issued an order 
friday finding umw members at island creek operations there in 
contempt for defying a backtowork order any union member who 
ignores the courts order and fails to report to work beginning 
monday will be fined 100 a day 
a federal judge in indiana signed an order friday directing umw 
leaders to appear at a hearing next week to answer contempt charges 
for refusing an order to return to work 
backtowork orders also are being sought by companies in alabama 
and pennsylvania and consolidation coal co has said it plans to 
seek similar legal action in illinois and ohio 
about 100 miners returned to work in st clairsville ohio and 
no new walkouts were reported friday 
in johnstown pa roving pickets turned away about 600 united 
steelworkers members at a bethlehem steel corp plant that makes 
railroad coal cars the company said bethlehem steel owns 
bethenergy mines 
the estimated number of miners involved in unauthorized walkouts 
according to union and industry officials are west virginia 
16000 illinois 8500 pennsylvania 6900 alabama 5000 ohio 
2560 kentucky 2325 indiana 1750 virginia 755 missouri

dorcas r hardy says she is stepping down as 
head of social security satisfied the agency she modernized and 
streamlined sometimes in the face of sharp congressional criticism 
is in good shape 
but she warns that while overall public confidence in the program 
is justifiably high policies using social security trust funds to 
underwrite other government programs and reduce the federal budget 
deficit are fueling a lack of confidence in the program by 
younger workers 
social security continues to be misunderstood by 
beneficiaries taxpayers and elected officials alike and most 
younger workers do not trust that the government will preserve 
social security for their golden years she said in her letter 
of resignation to president bush on friday 
hardy said she has confidence in the future of the social

the dropout rate was halved after this 
boston suburbs officials lavished attention on potential dropouts 
offering daycare centers vocational training for the disabled and 
night classes for working teens 
the secret is a kid cant drop out without going through a 
long program of helpproviders said schools superintendent robert 
ricci on friday its nothing that hasnt been done but most 
districts arent that flexible theres a blueprint here for urban 
districts 
ricci calculated the dropout rate by following a group of 
students from ninth grade through the day they should graduate the 
traditional method is to compare senior classes from year to year 
by tracking ninthgraders the schools can more accurately assess 
whether programs are working experts said 
in quincy they apparently work 
the 198788 class graduating lost 197 percent of its students 
this years graduating class was down by just 109 percent a loss 
of 70 students out of 643 potential graduates 
the success in retaining students came from a simple formula 
said ricci they get a lot of attention and a lot of 
alternatives 
any eighthgraders thought to be potential dropouts receive 
special counseling to help them make the transition to high school 
this is followed up through their ninth grade school year 
potential dropouts are usually a year or more older than their 
classmates behind in basic skill levels or from families that are 
poorly educated school officials said 
quincy offers schooling for teenage mothers by providing day 
care for their babies and vocational training for the disabled 
the school schedule can be adjusted to the students needs 
including parttime work combined with courses for credit at a 
junior college or in cambridge at the harvard university extension 
program 
students can work during the day and study for a general 
equivalency diploma or a ged at night 
if these inducements dont work and a student is determined to 
drop out he is encouraged to take the ged exam if he passes he 
can receive his diploma on graduation day if not he can take 
courses to help him pass 
quincy is a largely bluecollar city of 89000 people just south 
of boston its public schools serve 8000 youngsters the district 
consists of two high schools and one vocational school the program 
was developed through policy changes and some reorginzation 
resulting in no significant budget increase 
the quincy results drew applause friday from others concerned 
with dropout prevention 
brandeis university professor andrew hahn a labor market 
specialist concerned with the problems of urban education praised 
the quincy program 
the dropout problem is something a lot of people are dealing 
with when you lose half your ninthgrade class in some of our 
nations largest cities your community is going to suffer hahn 
said the best dropout prevention program has the top 
administrators involved what is so notable about quincy is that 
the superintendent is so passionate about it 
in major cities the attrition rate can be 40 percent to 60 
percent school officials said 
halving a dropout rate is impressive said michele cahill of the 
academy for educational development an international educational 
consulting firm in new york city that works with more than 40 urban 
school districts on dropout prevention 
what it seems like theyre doing that theyve put in a really 
good exit intervention ms cahill said 
she said researchers are finding that its the comprehensive 
programs that work

zhao ziyang moved into the political spotlight as 
a disciple of senior leader deng xiaoping successfully installing 
economic reforms in sichuan province and bringing a progressive 
style to the chinese leadership 
but with his ouster today as general secretary of the communist 
party zhao ended up with the same fate as his predecessor 
stripped of power and disgraced for sympathizing with students 
seeking democratic reforms 
in his tailored western suits zhao once represented the 
emergence of a new brand of leader in china a change from the 
revolutionary heroes who founded the communist state in 1949 to a 
new generation showing more interest in economic results than 
marxist ideology 
zhao 69 took over as acting communist party chief in january 
1987 after the ouster of hu yaobang who also was considered too 
sympathetic to student protesters calling for political reforms 
nine months later zhao formally was named party chief 
hus death on april 15 set off the student demonstrations in 
beijing now zhao too has fallen from favor after showing support 
for some of the demands of students and opposing the decision to 
declare martial law in the capital zhao has not been seen in public 
since may 19 a day before martial law was imposed 
while tens of thousands of students occupied tiananmen square 
last month zhao told visiting soviet leader mikhail gorbachev that 
chinese people could enjoy genuine democracy under the 47 
millionmember communist party he also said political and economic 
reform should proceed at an equal pace 
like deng zhao was purged during the 196676 cultural 
revolution accused of being a capitalist sympathizer in 1967 he 
was dragged from his home in the southern city of canton guangzhou 
and paraded through the streets with a dunce cap on his head 
but he came out of the internal exile that followed to 
energetically carry out dengs marketoriented reforms measures 
designed to rebuild and modernize a country that had fallen apart 
during the extreme leftism and repression of the cultural revolution 
in 1975 zhao became governor of sichuan the countrys most 
populous province he dismantled communes and allowed peasants to 
till private plots 
the reforms ended food shortages that had people at the brink of 
starvation under zhao the central province harvested bumper yields 
deng brought zhao to beijing in 1980 as a member of the partys 
policymaking politburo and vice premier six months later be became 
premier and served in that post until picked to head the communist 
party 
he traveled widely throughout the world and earned a reputation 
as an urbane and selfassured chinese leader who was tough at the 
negotiating table 
zhao was born in october 1919 the son of a wealthy landowner in 
central chinas henan province as with most chinese leaders few 
details of his family life are known 
he has been married twice and has four sons and a daughter zhao 
liang who studied in hawaii in 198183 he told reporters that he 
worked 10 hours a day jogged in the morning and argued with his 
family at the dinner table he also regularly played golf a sport 
once condemned in china as a luxury 
zhao joined the communist youth league in 1932 and became a full 
party member in 1936 13 years before the communists came to power 
after chasing the chinese nationalists from the mainland he headed 
the communist party in his native county for most of the 193745 war 
between china and japan 
while serving as a regional party official in the 1950s he 
orchestrated a purge in southern guangdong province against cadres 
accused of corruption ties to nationalist taiwan and opposition to 
land reform 
in 1957 zhao oversaw a rectification campaign in which 
80000 officials were banished to the countryside where they worked 
and faced criticism for their past actions 
zhao disappeared for four years after being purged at the start 
of the cultural revolution finally reemerging as party secretary 
in inner mongolia in 1971 
duing those chaotic years he appeared opportunistic at one 
point he called for exposure of dengs alleged crimes in an 
apparent act of selfpreservation not uncommon in chinas tumultuous 
politics 
by the time deng reappeared and consolidated power in 1978 zhao 
was firmly tied to the reformers 
we must not bind ourselves as silkworms do within cocoons he 
said in a 1979 speech all economic patterns and conventions which 
hold back the development of productive forces should be abolished

prodemocracy movement 
shanghai party chief jiang zemin named today to replace zhao

zhaos in november 1987 last year he gave up his post as mayor of 
shanghai chinas largest city with a population of 12 million to 
become party secretary of the city 
like conservative premier li peng jiang represents the new breed 
of chinese leader a technocrat loyal to the party and to senior 
leader deng xiaopings policies of economic pragmatism 
as mayor of shanghai he aggressively promoted the city as a 
financial center and an attractive location for foreign investment

trainee in a car factory around 1955 
jiang was born july 1926 in yangzhou city near shanghai he

purged from office during the 196676 cultural revolution in 1980 
he reemerged as a senior official in the state administration 
commission on import and export affairs and the state administration 
commission on foreign investment 
he went on to be named minister of the electronics industry and 
in 1985 returned to shanghai as mayor and deputy secretary of the 
party committee 
in 1986 during student demonstrations in shanghai he went to 
his alma mater and seeing a poster with chineselanguage excerpts 
from lincolns gettysburg address surprised students by reciting in 
english from the speech 
he told students they knew the words but not the essence of the 
us presidents speech and later criticized them for 
superficial knowledge of the west 
according to official profiles jiang also reads romanian french 
and japanese he is said to be fond of music and literature 
he is reportedly the soninlaw of li xiannian chinas former 
president li is one of the oldguard conservatives who supported 
deng in the current suppression of dissent

the new owner of the dallas cowboys football team 
isnt getting many cheers for a plan to outfit the teams 
cheerleaders in skimpier uniforms 
several of the teams cheerleaders say they had learned they 
might be required to wear spandex cycling shorts and halter tops 
they said that they also were asked to act as hostesses at parties 
fraternize with the team and appear in beer commercials 
more than a third have walked off the squad in protest but 
cowboys owner jerry jones said friday the furor is a 
misunderstanding and he hasnt changed any rules or policies 
he said violations of the cheerleading squad policies that 
prohibited drinking in uniform and fraternizing with players would 
no longer result in automatic expulsion 
lets count on the judgment of these wonderful people said 
the arkansas oilman who bought the team earlier this year lets 
not depend on rules 
but he did concede that a change was being considered in the 
cheerleaders familiar uniforms of white hot pants gogo boots 
blue shirts tied at the midriff and fringed vests 
the dallas times herald asked its readers to call in their 
opinion of new outfits for the cheerleaders the question was 
should jerry jones change the cheerleaders uniforms and make them 
fraternize with the team 
more than 93 percent said no 
only 208 callers sided with the cowboys owner while 2808 called 
in to say he should leave the uniforms alone 
as far as the cowboys cheerleaders are concerned they are the 
best in the united states and the rest are some of the cheapest 
said lee daniels 65 of dallas i hope they keep the uniforms and 
morals up and keep it just like its been for years 
cornell hill 37 of dallas took exception to the cheerleaders 
current look 
the uniforms look like a private school or something he 
said 
cheerleader director debbie bond has resigned and 14 veterans 
said they would leave with her the 23 new members have until monday 
to decide whether to stay 
several cowboys cheerleaders said conditions had become too lax 
since jones bought the team in february firing longtime coach tom 
landry the same day under former owner hr bum bright squad 
members were not allowed to drink or even be photographed with 
someone holding a drink while in uniform

hundreds of supporters of opposition 
leader aung san suu kyi violated martial law by taking to the 
streets of burmas capital a day after she was criticized by the 
government sources said today 
fridays gathering was one of the largest assemblies by 
opposition supporters since military commander gen saw maung seized 
power last september and his troops crushed dissent by killing 
hundreds of people

demand an end to a quarter century of military control of the 
government 
one burmese witness reached in rangoon said hundreds of

party of defying martial law and organizing antigovernment 
demonstrations he said the party must bear the consequences of

chinas communist party today ousted party chief 
zhao ziyang blaming him for the turmoil caused by the prodemocracy 
movement and for dividing the party 
zhao 69 an architect of a decade of economic reform was 
replaced by jiang zemin the shanghai party leader who cracked down 
on demonstrations in his city jiang is also considered an advocate 
of economic modernization 
the replacement of zhao as general secretary of the 47million 
member party was announced in a communique by the official xinhua 
news agency a change in party leadership had been rumored since the 
military assault in beijing on june 34 left hundreds and perhaps 
thousands of prodemocracy supporters dead 
jiang has taken a hard line in dealing with the protests since 
then he moved swiftly to end large protests that broke out in 
shanghai and three men were executed last week in shanghai for 
participating in riots a total of 27 people have been executed 
nationwide 
zhao is believed to have been purged for opposing senior leader 
deng xiaopings use of troops to quell student protests in beijing 
zhao has not been seen in public since may 19 and his whereabouts 
were unknown today 
the communique issued after a plenary session of 276 regular and 
alternate members of the partys central committee said zhao had 
unshirkable responsibilities for the recent political turmoil 
stemming from huge prodemocracy demonstrations in the capital and 
many other chinese cities 
it accused zhao of supporting the turmoil and splitting the 
party it said zhao caused serious losses to the cause of the 
party 
the report on zhao was read by premier li peng the conservative 
who triumphed over zhao in a party power struggle stemming from the 
protests 
the communique said zhao was dismissed as general secretary from 
his post in the 17member ruling politburo and its standing 
committee from membership in the 175member policymaking central 
committee and first vice chairman of the central military 
commission he had served as premier before he was named party chief 
in january 1987 
jiang 62 served as mayor of shanghai chinas largest city 
from 1985 to 1988 when he moved over to head the communist party in 
the city he entered the politburo where he was a collegue of 
zhaos in november 1987 
the communique said nothing about filing criminal charges against 
zhao who has been accused of supporting a counterrevolutionary 
rebellion 
the communique acknowledged that zhao did something beneficial 
to the reform the opening of china to the outside world and 
economic work it said the party will look further into his 
case 
the central committee also decided to remove hu qili 60 from 
the politburo standing committee hu is considered a moderate who 
also opposed the introduction of martial law in beijing 
jiang is a technocrat who speaks russian and english in 
shanghai he has actively worked to restore the citys reputation as 
a financial center and to attract foreign investment to revive its 
industrial base 
some earlier reports had suggested that qiao shi a politburo 
member in change of internal security would be named to replace 
zhao 
the party also expanded the politburo standing committee from 
five to six members replacing zhao and hu with jiang tianjin mayor 
li ruihuan and economist song ping head of the party organization 
department 
it also announced a reshuffling in the partys fourmember 
secretariat removing zhao allies rui xingwen and yan mingfu and 
replacing them with li ruihuan and politburo alternate ding guangen 
the secretariat is responsible for daytoday operations 
the new standing committee members are all regarded as strong 
advocates of chinas opendoor economic policies with the outside 
world they are also likely to back dengs attempt to unify the 
party behind his hardline stance toward activists and other critics 
the communique said the politburo met from monday through 
wednesday and the central committee which must make all formal 
decisions on leadership positions held its session on friday and 
today 
the leadership changes have been expected since may when the 
prodemocracy student demonstrations split the party leadership and 
triggered a power struggle between moderates and hardliners 
deng 84 came down on the side of the hardliners deciding to 
declare martial law in beijing on may 20 and ordering the military 
attack on the city 
earlier today authorities announced an army propaganda 
specialist has taken over as editor in chief at the official daily 
of the communist party in a reshuffling of the newspapers 
management 
the foreign affairs office of the peoples daily said shao huaze 
director of the propaganda department of the peoples liberation 
army had replaced tan wenrui as chief editor of chinas leading 
paper 
the office also said qian liren director at the daily had left 
his post he was replaced by gao di a senior official at the 
central party school of the party central committee 
both qian and tan resigned because of health reasons the office 
said without elaborating 
the replacements at the peoples daily came as the party stepped 
up its propaganda campaign to defend the suppression of 
prodemocracy activists

a ceasefire went into effect today in 
angola ending 14 years of civil war that killed tens of thousands 
of people and entangled the worlds superpowers as well as cuba and 
south africa 
however the marxist government and the usbacked rebels must 
still carry out difficult talks to make the pact a permanent peace 
rebel leader jonas savimbi and moscowtrained president jose 
eduardo dos santos of angola signed the truce and sealed it with a 
handshake late thursday at an african summit in zaire 
savimbi who left for home friday to tell his forces to prepare 
for peace said before departing i was not born to make war at 
all cost 
savimbis army has controlled most of southeastern angola for 
years administering schools and hospitals in rural areas occupied 
by up to 3 million of the countrys 9 million people 
savimbi son of a parttime protestant preacher told the zairian 
news agency he was prepared to work without preconditions with 
dos santos government 
president mobutu sese seko of zaire a savimbi ally credited with 
a prominent role in the reconciliation will mediate future 
negotiations the conservative mobutu is to meet president bush in 
washington on thursday to discuss peace in southern africa said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the summit of 20 african leaders in zaire was the first meeting 
between dos santos 47 and savimbi since the former allies in a 
struggle for black rule went to war in 1975 as portuguese colonizers 
left angola 
their agreement took many people by surprise as recently as 
monday angolan foreign minister afonso van dunem said his 
government would not negotiate with the rebels 
savimbi born in 1934 leads the national union for the total 
independence of angola unita a socialist group backed by china 
south africa and washington it has fought to share power with dos 
santos marxist popular movement for the liberation of angola which 
is backed by cuban forces and receives arms mainly from the soviet 
union 
despite thousands of foreign troops having supported both sides 
neither the government nor the rebels came close to delivering a 
knockout blow in the war 
the ceasefire follows a usbrokered regional peace accord 
signed in new york in december under that earlier pact south 
africa agreed to grant independence to namibia angolas southern 
neighbor and halt aid to savimbis guerrillas in exchange for 
withdrawal of the 50000 cuban troops backing dos santos 
government however savimbi was not party to that agreement 
his future role in angola was not clear 
the portugese news agency lusa said today that savimbi could 
become angolas representative to the united states for a period of 
two years the agency quoted unidentified angolan officials as 
saying savimbi could be named special counselor to washington 
angola has been pushing for diplomatic recoginition by the united 
states there was no indication savimbis possible appointment would 
lead to recognition and there was no independent confirmation of 
the lusa report 
zambian president kenneth kaunda said savimbi will go into exile 
under terms of the new pact but did not provide details reports in 
zaire said savimbis exile would be temporary 
rebel sources in washington however said savimbi would stay in 
angola 
mobutu said savimbi reaffirmed that he had no intention of 
participating in the next government 
the accord calls for reintegration of rebel forces into angolan 
society and the creation of a national reconciliation commission 
under mobutus chairmanship however it set no time or place for 
the commission to begin its work and did not specify who would 
represent the rival angolan parties 
the portuguese news agency lusa reported friday that the two 
sides would meet in the next few days in zimbabwe it gave no 
details

hu qili rose quickly to the pinnacle of chinas 
leadership under the wings of former communist party chief hu 
yaobang a man he once was expected to succeed 
but hu was purged from the party today in disgrace along with 
party chief zhao ziyang both branded as too lenient on the 
studentled democracy movement the government crushed earlier this 
month 
two years ago at the relatively young age of 58 hu was promoted 
to the communist party politburos standing committee an elite 
group of five to six people who make up the most powerful 
decisionmaking body in china 
hu gained prominence in the mid1980s for championing the 
economic reforms initiated by senior leader deng xiaoping and 
traveling throughout the country urging people to help change china 
we should be bold enough to break with some specific 
conclusions already proved through practice to be outdated or partly 
incorrect he said in a speech in april 1986 only by doing so 
can we uphold and develop marxism and push forward the socialist 
cause 
starting in 1985 as he worked his way up from the partys 
central committee to the politburo hu began making public 
appearances and joined some important missions abroad he also began 
standing in for senior leaders in dealings with visiting foreign 
dignitaries 
hu visited yugoslavia and west germany and he joined hu yaobang 
communist party chief at the time on a tour of five south pacific 
nations the two men are not related 
as the reform movement gained momentum hu solidified his 
standing under the tutelage of hu yaobang prompting speculation 
that he might succeed his mentor as party general secretary 
then came the student unrest that led to hu yaobangs ouster in 
1987 and criticism that he appeared too sympathetic to protesters 
demanding political reforms hu qili distanced himself from hu 
yaobang and later in the year became a member of the politburos 
standing committee but he had lost the prominence he gained as a 
champion of dengs fastpaced reforms 
branded a capitalist follower during the 196676 cultural 
revolution hu was exiled to the countryside his political comeback 
began in 1972 when he reappeared as a party functionary in ningxia 
when deng came to power in 1978 hu was summoned to beijing as 
communist youth league secretary and vice president of the 
prestigious qinghua university in 1980 hu was elected mayor of 
tianjin chinas thirdlargest city and served as director of the 
partys general office in 198284 
he joined the partys central committee and the secretariat in 
1982 
an engineer and graduate of qinghua hu is married with two 
children he was born in 1929 in the central province of shaanxi 
in addition to pushing for reforms hu supported chinas efforts 
to open itself to the outside world 
referring to party debate over the opendoor policy he said in a 
1985 interview i think it is very necessary for us to try to 
identify problems and overcome them in a timely fashion we need 
finetuning from time to time

a woman accused of walking her dog in a 
sly and vindictive manner across her neighbors lawn has agreed to 
pay compensation 
this is what could be described as a neighbors dispute that 
had got out of hand john mccann the prosecuting counsel told 
magistrates on friday 
the court in solihull a suburb of birmingham heard that 
winifred burrows 71 and lillian priddy 74 had discovered holes 
in the lawn bordering their prizewinning garden 
seeking confirmation of their suspicions they staked out the 
yard one february night and said they saw judith abercrombie 48 
strutting across their grass in highheeled shoes 
when confronted mccann said mrs abercrombie said to her dog 
come on lets go back and do it again 
mrs priddy and mrs burrows called the police who came to mrs 
abercrombies home and asked her to come to the station no 
chance she allegedly responded and was arrested 
the prosecution case is that it was an act of intent it was 
not an accident or recklessness and there have been ongoing 
problems between the two parties mccann said 
a charge of causing damage was dismissed when mrs abercrombie 
agreed to pay 50 pounds 78 compensation to the sisters and to 
post a bond of 200 pounds 310 to keep the peace for two years 
i accept there was a confrontation on the night of feb 8 but 
i have always denied and maintain my denial that i committed any 
criminal offense she said afterward 
mrs burrows and mrs priddy donated the damages to the police 
benevolent fund in gratitude for the support of the police 
we hope this will be the end of the matter mrs priddy said 
quite frankly we feel sorry for her

iran should be governed by a threemember 
advisory board chaired by ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis son ahmad 
an editorial in a governmentrun newspaper said today 
the governing board also should include president ali khamenei 
and parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani said the tehran times 
editorial which was carried by the staterun islamic republic news 
agency 
the editorial said ahmad khomeini should be chairman of the board 
because he was close to his father the architect of irans 1979 
islamic revolution and familiar with his thinking 
this will surely enable the leader ayatollah khamenei who 
himself has been a very close aide and disciple of the imam not to 
lose sight ever of the late imams trend of thought and action 
the englishlanguage editorial said iranians referred to khomeini 
as the imam or supreme spiritual leader 
khamenei 49 was chosen to succeed khomeini as the countrys 
supreme leader a day after khomeini 86 died of a heart attack june 
3 khameneis second term as president expires in october and the 
constitution bars him from running again 
rafsanjani the 55yearold parliament speaker and commander of 
the armed forces is the only announced candidate in the july 28 
presidential elections 
the younger khomeini 43 had no formal political role but served 
as his fathers chief assistant 
the iranian news agency monitored in nicosia said the editorial 
referred to economic and other unspecified problems the country 
faces 
with the experienced aides in different areas the leadership 
can most definitely speed up the realization of the divine goals of 
the islamic revolution the paper said 
there was speculation before khomeini died that the council he 
set up to choose his successor would appoint a committee in his 
place but the majority selected khamenei

destiny of the party and the state comrade zhao ziyang made the 
mistake of supporting the turmoils and splitting the party and he

the nature and consequences of his mistake are very serious 
although he did something beneficial to the reform the opening of 
china to the outside world and the economic work when he held 
principal leading posts in the party and government he obviously 
erred in guidelines in the party and practical work 
especially after taking charge of the work of the central 
committee he took a passive approach to the adherence to the four 
cardinal principles and opposition to bourgeois liberalization and 
gravely neglected party building cultural and ethical development 
and ideological and political work causing serious losses to the 
cause of the party 
in view of comrade zhao ziyangs serious mistakes listed above

most of the defendants belong to the minority shiite moslem sect 
in predominantly sunni moslem kuwait 
the case was first reported when the indictment was released in 
march but authorities never said when the defendants tried to 
overthrow the government 
they include 18 kuwaitis believed to be of iranian descent two 
iranians nine iraqis two lebanese the briton and one person whose 
country of origin was unknown the defendants included engineers 
teachers computer specialists electricians laborers and a former 
police officer 
they were charged with belonging to illegal groups that sought 
to demolish the social and economic fabric of the country 
spread destructive ideologies and defame the emir sheik jaber 
alahmed alsabah 
the indictment said they used public statements and writings 
sketches and pictures in their activities 
only 20 of the defendants appeared before the court during the 
trial which began on may 13 
court chairman mohammed albannai sentenced them during a public 
session attended by relatives of the defendants the defendants 
present smiled broadly but made no comment 
kuwait was a repeated target of terrorist attacks during the 
eightyear iraqiran war the attacks were blamed on iran 
predominately shiite and opposed to kuwait for backing iraq 
one case involved an attempt on the life of the emir in may 1985 
when a boobytrapped car rammed into his motorcade and exploded he 
escaped with minor injuries but five people were killed 
relations between kuwait and iran have improved since a 
ceasefire in the iraniraq war went into effect in august but the 
latest case underscored kuwaits determination to keep monitoring 
the shiite minority

crews worked today to contain 1 million 
gallons of heating oil that spilled from a tanker and created a 
fivemile slick that began washing up on the rhode island coast 
white house officials arrived just hours after the 
providencebound tanker world prodigy carrying 76 million gallons 
of heating oil struck a rock at brenton reef in rhode island sound 
about 430 pm friday 
just a few hours later oil spilled in a collision of an oil 
tanker and a tugboat at the mouth of the houston ship channel at 
galveston bay texas the accidents came three months after nearly 
11 million gallons of heavy crude oil gushed into alaskan waters 
from the tanker exxon valdez causing the nations worst oil spill 
army helicopters surveying the rhode island shore this morning 
confirmed that oil was washing ashore near jamestown said robert l 
bendick jr director of the state department of environmental 
management 
bendick said curiosity seekers in jamestown who were hampering 
cleanup efforts were removed from the towns picturesque beach 
across the harbor from newport 
the spill occurred one mile south of newport and by today it was 
five miles long no harm to wildlife was immediately reported but 
all of the states beaches were closed today 
the department of environmental management said they would remain 
offlimits until the oil had been cleaned up 
boaters also were asked to stay in port we dont want boats 
churning up the oil slick said stephen g morin chief of the 
departments emergency response team but the organizers said the 
salem pro sail series will continue as scheduled today at the 
newport yachting center the competition began june 21 and is set to 
continue until sunday 
vice adm clyde t lusk jr of the coast guard said a team from 
mobile ala and special skimmer ships were brought in to combat 
the spill 
nine of the ships 27 tanks were damaged said coast guard capt 
eric williams of the marine safety office in providence 
tim morgan a diver who surveyed the hull of the 530foot tanker 
said there is a 200footlong gash as wide as five feet along one 
side there are about 150 feet of dents and smaller holes on the 
other side he said 
the damage is so extreme its impossible to seal the vessel off 
with any kind of soft patches morgan said 
the coast guard began unloading the world prodigy about 220 
am and williams said the work could take up to a week 
cleanup crews initially strung booms around the slick and later 
replaced them with booms with deeper skirts to pool the oil said 
lusk 
the white house criticized for its response to the alaskan 
spill reacted swiftly to the rhode island accident president bush 
dispatched interior secretary manuel lujan and william reilly head 
of the environmental protection agency to the scene 
its a big spill and in a very important place reilly said 
at a news conference about 2 am after federal officials met with 
gov edward diprete narragansett bay is one of the crown jewels 
of the countrys ocean resources 
richard dreedan a bush assistant at the scene said the 
president has determined to do everything possible to respond to 
this situation adding weve obviously learned something from 
that situation in alaska 
the providence port where the ship sailing under a greek flag 
was heading is about 25 miles from newport via narragansett bay 
which feeds into the providence river 
john civic who lives near narragansett bay witnessed the 
accident 
im looking and this guy was barrelling along and boom he just 
stopped dead in the water he was moving pretty good faster than 
most he said 
officials said the magnitude was far less than the valdez 
disaster in march the amount was less and no 2 heating oil is 
lighter and easier to recover than the crude oil that poured into 
prince william sound 
there still will be a mess on the beach it still will have to 
be sucked up with absorbent pads but at least its not like valdez 
where you have to sandblast it steam it off the rocks said morin 
the odor of the spilled oil wafted through this tony seaside 
resort where the shoreline is dotted with mansions 
boy its enough to knock you off your feet said rhode 
island secretary of state kathleen s connell who lives near the 
shore 
the ships master was identified as iakovas georgudis by chief 
warrant officer jerry alfred of the coast guard in newport 
diprete said the skipper told him no pilot was aboard the tanker 
at the time of the crash he said the captain also said he made a 
mistake in plotting the ships course 
marine safety office officials said the ship had not come quite 
close enough to the bay to require a pilot but that the ship so 
close that it was unwise of the captain to operate without one 
its kind of a gray area out there said chief warrant 
officer jerry alfred a marine safety investigator 
the governor said the state planned legal action although he 
said it was too soon to talk about criminal charges 
there was plenty of ocean there there was no reason this 
terrible tragedy had to happen diprete said 
brenton reef is a nautical landmark where americas cup yacht 
races were held for many years 
the tanker began its journey in bourgas bulgaria on the black 
sea according to lloyds of london the coast guard said the ship is 
owned by the greekbased ballard shipping co but did not know who 
owns the cargo

turks to flee bulgaria 
the protest in taksim square was organized by the governing 
motherland party and the opposition social democrat and true path 
parties

and banners hung from surrounding buildings denounced bulgaria and 
its leader todor zhivkov protesters carried banners saying end 
bulgarian cruelty freedom for turks in bulgaria and the 
new hitler zhivkov 
political leaders addressing the rally protested the expulsion of 
ethnic turks by bulgaria the crowd chanted slogans such as 
murderer zhivkov army to sofia and we want guns against 
bulgaria 
in 1984 bulgaria began forcing ethnic turks to adopt bulgarian 
names and forbidding them to speak their language or practice their 
religion 
thousands of turks began leaving bulgaria after zhivkov said may 
29 that any bulgarian citizen including the 1millionstrong 
turkish minority could leave the country three weeks later 
250000 turks had applied for passports and 150000 of them 
reportedly received them immediately

the association of immigrants from bulgaria and sevket yilmaz 
chairman of turkeys largest labor federation condemned the 
bulgarian oppression and expressed solidarity with ethnic turks 
they said turkey was ready to accept all ethnic turks who wanted 
to come and they called on the international commnuity for support 
more than 60000 ethnic turks have crossed into turkey over the 
past month bringing whatever belongings they could carry 
bulgarian officials say seven people died in violent clashes with 
security forces in may but western diplomats in sofia estimate at 
least 30 ethnic turks were killed and up to 5000 expelled 
immediately after the clashes 
premier turgut ozal has called on bulgaria and the united nations 
to guarantee that ethnic turks who want to leave bulgaria can do so 
in peace but sofia rejects a un discussion of its turkish 
minority insisting that such an ethnic group no longer exists in 
bulgaria

for selling software in china are on the back burner 
at an agriculture department laboratory in fort lauderdale fla 
a scheduled research trip to china by an aquatic weed specialist has 
been put on hold 
but in foxboro mass executives of the foxboro co are in 
nightly touch by telephone and fax machine with chinese colleagues

at the sackler gallery for asian art in washington and at the 
columbus ohio museum of art people are lining up to view chinese 
art exhibits and plans for more such exhibitions are under way 
and in new york the national council of churches has begun 
orientation sessions for 19 new teachers to teach english in chinese 
schools 
the warming of us chinese relations which began with pingpong 
diplomacy has blossomed into a patchwork of cultural and scientific 
ties about 14 billion a year in twoway trade and investment of 
some 34 billion in china by about 300 companies an estimated 
300000 americans visited china last year and more than 50000 
chinese came to the united states approximately 62500 chinese 
students have enrolled in american schools since the beginning of 
the thaw in the early 1970s 
president bush is being criticized by some in congress for not 
acting more forcefully against the repressive tactics of beijing 
and was quoted by a senator friday as saying there was a long road 
that was going to have to be traveled in that relationship and that 
we shouldnt move precipitously 
roger sullivan president of the uschina business council 
supported the presidents goslow approach but said trade relations 
between the two countries will nevertheless be cut back 
considerably 
hes not cutting the ties but the chinese are doing it 
themselves very clearly sullivan said in an interview 
china and the united states at odds since the communist takeover 
of the mainland in 1949 began their rapprochement with an exchange 
of table tennis teams in 1971 president nixon followed up with a 
visit to beijing in 1972 and diplomatic relations between the two 
countries were restored in 1979 
the effort that has been done since nixons time till now is 
just going down the drain said south kousoum deputy director of 
the asianpacific american chamber of commerce 
q soft the virginia computer software firm had reportedly been 
exploring the possibility of selling its services to the chinese 
national transportation system 
because of what happened in china in the last few weeks that 
definitely puts china on the back burner for us said rawlein 
soberano director of program development for the company we are 
not going to pursue it more actively until the political stability 
there is firmly established and things improve that would encourage 
us to pursue a viable business activity with that country 
gerald gleason a foxboro vice president said its shanghai 
factory employing about 500 people to make control systems for oil 
refineries and power plants had turned a profit every year but the 
first since it opened six years ago as a joint venture with a 
chinese company 
everything was normal right up until a few weeks ago he 
said the week after the shootings in tiananmen square the company 
withdrew the american executive who is deputy general manager of the 
plant the other american employe on the scene the chief engineer 
was already back in foxboro on an assignment connected with his work 
for the chinese plant the mens families were also brought out 
they are still in foxboro 
but they are in communication with the plant every night by 
telephone fax or telex and are participating in decisions and what 
have you and the plant is running in a more or less normal phase 
gleason said 
gleason said he anticipated a good chance of normal operation 
although everything is problematical 
there is certainly a continuing risk that some sort of 
sanctions could develop that would make it difficult for us to 
operate because of the pressure both from the left and the right in 
the congress on the president he said the presidents present 
position would not seem to threaten ventures such as ours 
from san francisco larry miller a spokesman for bechtel said 
its two major projects in china had not been affected one is a 
nuclear power plant at daya bay about 50 miles up the coast from 
hong kong for which it is providing management services during 
construction the other is the 640 million hotel it is building in 
shanzhen the company transferred the four americans in its beijing 
office to shanzhen after the disturbances and miller said a 
decision is planned during the coming week on whether to send them 
back meanwhile a chinese company in a joint venture with bechtel 
is keeping the beijing office open 
the united states and china opened a research laboratory in 
beijing in december to help find natural enemies of insects and 
weeds that threaten crops in the two countries officials said the 
chinese academy of agricultural sciences was expected to send 
scientists to the fort lauderdale lab this year 
everything as far as i know is on hold until we receive word 
ted center a research entomologist at fort lauderdale who is the 
lead scientist for biological control projects on aquatic weeds 
said we had planned to have one of our scientists over there in 
july and that trip has been canceled pending further developments 
nobody really knows what is going to happen 
other joint uschinese scientific projects include research on 
rangeland weeds that are common in both countries and an 
arrangement by the energy department and the chinese academy of 
sciences to study the greenhouse effect

two moderate earthquakes shook residents 
awake early today but no damage or injuries were reported a 
spokeswoman said 
two temblors each measuring 41 on the richter scale of ground 
motion struck five miles north of the town of jackson said pat 
jorgenson a spokeswoman for the us geological survey in golden 
colo 
well it really shook i mean you know the windows rattled and 
you could just feel it said joanne cross who works at the wort 
hotel in jackson i thought is somebody having a fight upstairs 
and breaking the furniture or are we having an earthquake it was 
just a little hard to really tell 
the first jolt hit at 325 am mdt and the second temblor shook 
the area at 425 am mdt ms jorgenson said 
it was not immediately known whether the second shaker was an 
aftershock of the first quake she said 
a fault system has not yet been identified in the area of the 
temblors although there have been earthquakes there in the past 
she said 
it has been some time since they have had any of this 
magnitude ms jorgenson said 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude or the height of quakegenerated shock waves recorded 
on a seismograph 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight damage 
in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 6 
severe damage

each day hundreds of trucks 
buses and cars are in line at this border checkpoint filled with 
ethnic turks leaving this communist country in hopes of finding 
civil and religious freedom 
i have left all my wealth behind my house my cattle 
everything said a farmer from the southeastern town of haskovo 
spreading his arms in despair as he waited with thousands of others 
to cross into turkey 
many may face unemployment deprivation and an uncertain future 
in turkey which has millions of citizens working in western europe 
because they cannot make a living at home 
but the turks are leaving bulgaria anyway driven by centuries of 
mutual suspicion an assimilation campaign and fears that arose 
after violent clashes with security forces in may killed at least 
seven ethnic turks 
foreign observers in bulgarias capital sofia say the 
emigration of the moslem turks could be disastrous for both 
countries and a serious challenge to the 35year rule of bulgarian 
leader todor zhivkov 
entire villages have been vacated some factories have no workers 
and crops are left in the ground causing enormous damage to the 
bulgarian economy according to a government adviser who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the exodus began after zhivkov announced may 29 that all 
bulgarian citizens including the 1 million turks could leave the 
country 
three weeks later a quarter of a million turks had applied for 
passports and 150000 of them had received one according to deputy 
foreign minister ivan ganev 
the rush to the passport office followed last months clashes 
between security forces and ethnic turks protesting the assimilation 
campaign which began in 1984 the campaign forced all turks to 
adopt bulgariansounding names banned their language in public and 
restricted their rights to practice the moslem religion 
the bulgarians say seven people died in the unrest western 
diplomats in sofia estimate at least 30 ethnic turks were killed 
there always has been a mutual suspicion between bulgarians and 
turks rooted in 500 years of ottoman rule in bulgaria yet despite 
their lingering resentment of turks many ethnic bulgarians 
privately concede that the campaign to force turks to adopt 
bulgariansounding names was a mistake 
emotions are inflamed by a diplomatic war of words in which 
bulgaria and turkey have blamed each other for starting the current 
problems 
they whipped up a mass psychosis ganev said of the turkish 
government western diplomats in sofia while strongly critical of 
bulgarias actions concede that turkish radio broadcasts urging the 
ethnic turks to put up moral and spiritual resistance to the 
bulgarians campaign do little to ease tensions 
in public both bulgaria and turkey have voiced willingness to 
hold talks but sofia rejects any agenda that includes discussion of 
a turkish minority it insists no longer exists in bulgaria 
by june 22 55000 ethnic turks had crossed into turkey on their 
new passports clutching any belongings they could carry 
hundreds of trucks buses cars and trolleys loaded with 
everything from household equipment to bedding and furniture jammed 
the kapitan andreevo border post in recent days with passengers 
waiting up to three days to cross 
bulgarian drivers who refuse to drive across forced families out 
of the vehicles making them walk into turkey with their belongings 
a couple searched desperately for their son in the confusion a 
frail whitehaired woman lay limp on a makeshift sickbed in the 
back of a car 
in a small town en route to kapitan andreevo about 200 people 
waited outside a bank to withdraw money they are buying whatever 
they can because they are allowed to take along only a limited sum 
when crossing into turkey a bulgarian explained 
why leave in such haste for an uncertain future 
above all the names said a turkish woman they dont 
allow us to use our language and they are destroying our mosques 
she added refusing to give her name 
she said she knew of people in her native area of kardzhali an 
ethnic turkish region in southeastern bulgaria who were fined for 
using the turkish language 
i was given only three days to leave my home said a gaunt 
man from the northern shumen area 
an old woman carrying an oil lamp told a bulgarian reporter 
nearby im sure there wont be any electricity at the place in 
turkey where i will go 
several emigrants interviewed in the presence of bulgarian 
reporters apparently feared reprisals when talking to a westerner 
some said they were leaving only on an excursion 
but the amount of luggage indicated they did not plan to return

the shutdown of the rancho seco nuclear plant 
in california the first forced by a voter initiative is adding 
to the industrys ills but analysts doubt it will set off a chain 
reaction of plant closures 
rancho seco began shutting down just hours after residents in the 
sacramento municipal utility district voted june 6 to pull the plug 
on a 15yearold plant that suffered a history of expensive 
breakdowns and poor management 
antinuclear groups hailed the ballot result and some suggested 
it could prove a catalyst for citizen initiatives against other 
nuclear plants but early indications are that the fallout will be 
much less dramatic 
the circumstances with rancho seco were unique to rancho seco 
so were not going to have a domino effect said scott denman 
director of the safe energy communication council a 
washingtonbased group opposed to nuclear power 
he added however that because it focused on the economics of 
nuclear power the rancho seco campaign may lead to broader interest 
in alternative sources of energy such as solar power and efforts 
to make more efficient use of all energy supplies 
thus in the longer run he said the rancho seco vote may prove 
to be a milestone 
we tend to think its the last flapping of the tail after the 
fish has been pulled from the water he said 
industry supporters say rancho seco was an aberration noting 
that 15 other citizen initiatives against nuclear power prior to the 
rancho seco case failed they see no indication that the public 
wants to throw out nuclear power 
we think that rancho seco was not a vote against nuclear power 
but a vote against the way that plant was run by upper management 
said scott peters a spokesman for the us council for energy 
awareness a pronuclear group 
the nuclear industry has been stagnating for more than a decade 
partly because of public wariness about safety and partly because of 
economic problems no utility has ordered a new nuclear plant since 
1978 and many nuclear supporters agree with critics that no orders 
are likely before the turn of the century 
i dont know of a single chief executive officer in our 
industry that would bet his company on a nuclear plant said 
william mccollam jr president of the edison electric institute a 
trade group of privately owned utilities 
he called the rancho seco vote not good for the public 
perception of nuclear power 
many nuclear plants are run efficiently but those that are not 
have blackened the industrys image 
rancho seco had a poor record producing less than 40 percent of 
the electricity that would have resulted from unfailing yearround 
operation far below the industry average the utility district had 
to double its rates over the past four years to pay for plant 
improvements that cost more than the reactor itself 
john ahearne a former chairman of the nuclear regulatory 
commission said he didnt expect the rancho seco vote to trigger a 
rash of citizen moves against nuclear power he said the shutdown 
exposed an important weakness in the industry the inability or 
unwillingness to force a poorperforming plant to change its ways 
the industry knew very well that this was a terrible plant 
he said yet it turned a blind eye and in effect allowed nuclear 
critics to strengthen their hand 
several other us nuclear plants are suffering from poor 
performance and the nrc which regulates the nations 109 operating 
reactors says its losing patience with some of the laggards 
earlier this month the nrc raised the possibility of taking the 
extraordinary step of closing down two reactors at the turkey point 
power station in florida because of poor performance the reactors 
have been on the commissions list of worstrun nuclear stations 
since it began the rating system in 1986 
in maryland the calvert cliffs nuclear plant has fallen into a 
rapid decline less than two years ago it was given rave reviews by 
an international inspection team now it is listed by the nrc as 
among the worstrun us plants the plant shut down its two 
reactors in may because of mechanical problems creating a revenue 
drain and prospects of power shortages in the baltimore area 
despite these and other problems the nuclear industry faces a 
less vocal public opposition than in the immediate aftermath of the 
1979 reactor accident at three mile island in pennsylvania which 
was the most severe in us history 
there is relatively little organized campaigning for example to 
close turkey point or calvert cliffs even the peach bottom nuclear 
plant in pennsylvania which was closed down for about two years by 
the nrc after control room operators were discovered sleeping on the 
job in 1987 faces little local opposition

students who study hard monday through friday 
and then party all night on weekends may lose much of what they 
learned during the week according to a sleep researcher 
carlyle smith a professor of psychology at trent university in 
peterborough ontario said that retaining of new complex knowledge 
is a fragile thing that can be disrupted even by mild sleep 
deprivation during critical nights just after learning the 
information 
it appears skewing the sleep cycle by just two hours can have 
this effect said smith this means that the sleep periods 
following a class or a study period can be as important to learning 
as the book work itself he said 
watching a long late movie the night following a class and 
then sleeping in the next morning will make it so youre not 
learning what you thought he said youll not lose it all 
just about 30 percent 
in a paper prepared for presentation saturday at the annual 
meeting of the association of professional sleep societies smith 
said he researched the effects of sleep deprivation on learning by 
controlling the sleep of four groups of students after they had all 
been taught a complex logic game and a list of paired words 
one group was deprived totally of sleep for the night after 
learning the task that same night another group was awakened 
whenever they slipped into the deep phase of slumber called rapid 
eye movement sleep or rem another group was awakened during sleep 
periods that were not rem and the fourth group was allowed to sleep 
normally 
when tested a week later on the paired words there was no 
learning deficit among any of the groups but when tested on the 
complex logic game the groups deprived of all sleep or of rem sleep 
all showed a learning deficit of 30 percent when compared to the 
other two groups 
smith in an interview said that his earlier studies have shown 
that this same experiment conducted on the sleep cycle the third 
night after learning a task gives about the same results sleep 
deprivation the second night after learning however seems to have 
no effect 
this means he said that the students who party all night on 
friday after a tough week in school will lose 30 percent of the 
learning they acquired on wednesday and on friday if they also lose 
sleep on saturday then thursdays learning is also affected 
theres a vulnerable time period after learning said 
smith it has something to do with processing the material 
he said studies monitoring rem sleep have shown steep increases 
in the length of such sleep on the first and third nights after 
learning a major task the brain he said apparently needs these 
periods of rest to properly sort and store the information for later 
recall if the brain is deprived of these rest periods then about a 
third of the knowledge is lost forever 
complex tasks that require logical application of rules to new 
situations are the most critically affected he said this would take 
in such subjects as math physics chemistry and foreign language 
wordbased learning seemed little affected smith said

in her native china 14yearold artist wang yani squatted barefoot 
on the smithsonian gallery floor and demonstrated with lightning 
brush and ink strokes why she is called a very rare phenomenon 
anywhere in the world 
it took the slight muscular girl in jean shorts slightly more 
than a halfhour to fill her 8footby4foot sheet of paper with 
pigments and ink which she dripped poured smeared dabbed and 
delicately brushed as she danced back and forth 
in yanis hands the brush sings and the ink dances said one 
observer 
yani created a scene of two playful black monkeys her favorite 
animals gathering pears under the gaze of flitting songbirds and 
plump dour hens 
she called it the happy partners in the orchard stamped it 
with her name seals in red and shyly smiled for the first time as 
the hushed crowd surrounding her in the arthur m sackler gallery 
burst into applause 
im finished she said through an interpreter im very 
happy 
her display of extraordinary artistic talent took place at a 
press briefing last week before a collection of 69 of her paintings 
goes on display sunday for a fourmonth engagement at the sackler a 
smithsonian museum of asian art 
the show yani the brush of innocence will appear at the 
nelsonatkins museum of art in kansas city mo from dec 16 to 
jan 28 and will be seen at the asian art museum in san francisco 
next march 7 through april 29 
the exhibition was organized by the nelsonatkins museum and is 
sponsored by the chinese ministry of culture the chinese 
governments violent crackdown on prodemocracy student 
demonstrators in the past three weeks did not disrupt plans for the 
show as some sackler officials had feared yani and her father flew 
here from beijing without incident 
i have not felt there is going to be any effect on yani in the 
future said her father artist wang shiqiang 44 
museum director milo beach said yani is a true prodigy whose 
fresh spontaneous paintings of childlike humor and grace have an 
ability to communicate that is not limited by geography or age 
she is the youngest artist to be honored with a oneperson show 
in smithsonian history beach said 
jan stuart a chinese art expert at the sackler said a prodigy 
of yanis gifts in the visual arts is a very rare phenomenon 
anywhere in the world 
born in a small village in rural guiangxi province in southern 
china yani started painting when she was 2 her works were 
exhibited in three chinese cities when she was 4 and since have 
been displayed in japan west germany singapore hong kong london 
and st petersburg fla 
she has turned out an estimated 10000 paintings but never had 
formal art training she said she once took art classes in school 
but my work was disagreeable to my teacher so i stopped going 
her father who is an oil painter has refused to coach yani and 
even abandoned his own painting a few years ago to make sure she was 
not influenced by his own style of western realism teaching may 
spoil her innate creativity he said 
nature was her teacher said ms stuart yani said she was 
intrigued by the animals at the local zoo especially the monkeys 
who are like children playing in kindergarten in the mountains and 
gardens near her home 
the exhibition starts with her brushandink portrait of a 
kitten done at age 3 and includes a 35foot handscroll titled a 
hundred monkeys which she painted at age 9 as she grew older 
yanis subjects have broadened to include her friends yanis 
party flowers the lotus flowers are so pretty and 
landscapes later more complex works include last night i dreamt 
i saw the racing egrets 
most of yanis paintings are stored in her home and none has been 
sold privately although 44 of the works that her family gave to the 
chinese government were sold to collectors most of them in west 
germany for an undetermined sum 
yanis father says he was told that four small yani paintings 
given to the chinese postal service for a postage stamp design in 
1983 were sold to an unknown stamp collector for 13000 
yani will return to the sackler in september to give painting 
demonstrations for art teachers and school children she will take 
her paintings back to china but may leave an original with the 
sackler a museum spokeswoman said

anthony m kennedy in his first full term as a 
supreme court justice is providing a consistent crucial fifth vote 
to what has become a muscular conservative majority 
hes the tiebreaking vote in almost every important issue in 
which the supreme court finds itself split said a delighted 
daniel popeo of the conservative washington legal foundation 
patricia ireland of the national organization for women said 
what we feared has borne out justice kennedy so far has proved a 
disaster 
the courts 198889 term is entering its final week and several 
important decisions are pending two will give kennedy a chance to 
cast his first votes on the issues of abortion and churchstate 
relations the court is closely divided on both 
but kennedys voting pattern already is established and it 
offers some surprises 
perhaps most remarkable is that kennedy statistically is a more 
faithful voting ally of the courts conservative leader chief 
justice william h rehnquist than is antonin scalia a fellow 
appointee of former president reagan 
scalias judicial philosophy has been viewed as being far more 
ideologically conservative than kennedys 
but of this terms signed decisions not reached by a unanimous 
court kennedy and rehnquist voted together in 90 percent scalia 
and rehnquist were together in 86 percent 
the number of 54 decisions to date this term is 27 down from 
the 41 recorded during the 198687 term when kennedys seat was 
occupied by the nowretired lewis f powell 
but of 33 key decisions tracked by the associated press 14 have 
come on 54 votes 
the courts most difficult and important decisions often come as 
its term winds down in june and this year has been no different 
of 15 key decisions announced this month the court has split 54 
in 12 of them kennedy joined or led the majority in 10 of the 12 
in those the court 
made it more difficult for minorities and women to prove 
onthejob bias by using statistics 
expanded the power of white men to challenge courtapproved 
affirmative action plans helping minorities and women as unlawful 
reverse discrimination against them 
shielded states and state officials from some civil rights 
lawsuits 
made it more difficult to sue cities when their employees 
violate someones civil rights 
limited the scope of a key civil rights law ruling that it does 
not apply to racial or sexual harassment in employment 
ruled that states may not be sued under a federal law aimed at 
bettering the educational opportunities of handicapped people 
said federal prosecutors may seize the assets of suspected 
criminal defendants even if those assets were going to be used to 
hire a lawyer 
ruled that states are not obligated to provide free lawyers to 
death row inmates who lose their initial round of appeals 
in two of junes 54 decisions kennedy joined the courts 
liberal wing to rule that burning the american flag is a 
constitutionally protected form of political protest and that states 
may be sued in federal courts for monetary damages in some 
environmental cases 
scalia also was a member of the majority in the flagburning 
decision but the usually liberalvoting john paul stevens joined 
rehnquist and justices byron r white and sandra day oconnor in 
dissent 
in most of the june 54 votes the majority consisted of kennedy 
rehnquist scalia white and oconnor 
the flagburning vote aside popeo said kennedy is all that we 
would have expected from bork and more 
reagans nomination of conservative robert h bork to the supreme 
court was rejected by the senate in 1987 the presidents second 
choice judge douglas h ginsburg had his nomination withdrawn 
after news reports that he smoked marijuana while a law professor at 
harvard 
because of his demeanor kennedy might accomplish much more 
than bork popeo said he is quietly effective a builder of 
coalitions 
ms ireland of now agreed saying kennedy is a bork with a 
better style 
the term red neck justice meted out with country club style 
seems to fit she said

the justice department is conducting a criminal 
investigation of a kansasbased company accused of stealing oil from 
indianowned wells a senate committee spokesman says 
the probe stems from information about koch industries inc 
gathered by a special investigating committee of the senate select 
committee on indian affairs spokesman sam hirsch said friday 
this has been referred to the us attorney confirmed koch 
spokesman george pearson 
he said however that koch officials and representatives of the 
us attorney in oklahoma city okla would meet before a formal 
investigation begins 
they the us attorneys office will have to make a decision 
on whether to prosecute said pearson director of public 
relations for koch 
he said they may drop the probe after hearing kochs side of the 
story he said no date had been set yet for the meeting 
assistant us attorney nancy jones in oklahoma city said her 
office could neither confirm nor deny the existence of an ongoing 
investigation 
the special senate committee focused on koch the countrys 
largest independent oil purchaser at a may 10 hearing in which 
witnesses said koch employees purposefully mismeasured oil from 
wells on indian lands 
in a 57page statement issued june 8 koch said the committee 
unjustly defamed koch and caused severe damage to its reputation 
and business 
the lengthy document reviewed point by point the accusations 
against the 49yearold oil company which is based in wichita 
it said the figures the committee used in its allegations were 
inaccurate and that comparisons with other companies were based on 
noncomparable statistics 
the committee stands firmly behind the findings released in its 
may hearings hirsch said the committees investigators caught 
koch employees in the act of stealing oil on six separate occasions 
koch gaugers and supervisors also admitted to committee 
investigators that it was company policy to mismeasure oil he 
said 
hirsch said documents the committee subpoenaed from koch and 
almost 30 other companies corroborated the committees findings 
he said koch executives were presented the findings during closed 
depositions and their responses were cited in the public hearings 
koch was also given the opportunity to testify in our public 
hearings but they would have been subject of course to cross 
examination by the attorneys who conducted our investigation said 
hirsch company representatives did not testify at the public 
hearings 
hirsch said the committee would review kochs june 8 statement 
before making its final report sometime this fall 
the special committee has been investigating all areas of indian 
affairs and came upon the koch case while probing federal agencies 
assigned to protecting indian lands 
pearson said the company never received a formal informal 
verbal or written invitation to testify 
when asked if the company requested an opportunity to speak 
pearson said koch did not feel it would be in its best interest to 
appear at the hearing because of its format 
we can be hurt at a hearing he said they the committee 
cant be 
in congressional hearings witnesses usually submit lengthy 
written statements for the record and then are asked to summarize 
their comments followed by questioning from the members of congress 
and staff 
pearson said that unlike in a court of law those being 
questioned have limited means to defend themselves and could be 
greatly damaged if the hearing were televised 
in its june 8 statement koch said the committee used anecdotal 
evidence which was misleading at best and false at worst at the 
hearing 
of witness mary limpy a homeless cheyennearapaho koch said 
her problems obviously lie elsewhere and to suggest to this poor 
lady that koch is at fault is the height of demagoguery 
the woman claimed her financial problems stemmed from infrequent 
low royalty payments and that the leases on the wells in which she 
had part interest were sold to koch 
we heard that the well had been capped for two years but that 
someone was stealing our oil because people saw trucks coming and 
going from the allotment limpy said in her testimony 
pearson said tenneco owned the leases and koch bought the oil 
from tenneco he said the wells were never capped 
he also pointed out that many people had interests in the wells 
and limpys share was a small fraction of the amount tenneco paid 
out to those people explaining her small payments 
two other witnesses thurmon parton and arnita parton gonzalez 
testified their royalty checks dropped from 3000 to 1000 a month 
when koch became involved with their leases according to the 
companys statement the brother and sister saw an increase in their 
payments 
koch officials blamed a dissident family member william i koch 
for the trouble saying he had a vendetta against koch 
industries 
one of the witnesses who testified was an investigator who had 
worked for william koch but a spokesman for william koch said the 
senate committee made the first contact 
in their zeal to get an oil company and particularly one that 
was politically unimportant the staff obviously seized upon the 
distorted information provided by william i koch embellished it 
with incorrect numbers and by withholding or ignoring evidence 
favorable to koch produced a totally unfair and onesided 
hearing koch asserted in its statement

richard m nixon has praised president bushs 
measured response to the deadly crackdown on democracy 
demonstrators in beijing urging the white house to stand firm 
against a strange coalition of chinabashers who want harsh us 
action 
nixon who as president reopened the door to china in 1972 said 
punitive policies would be popular politically and satisfying 
emotionally but would have no impact on chinas hard line communist 
leaders and would dash prospects for economic progress and eventual 
political reform 
if in our anger we drive china back into the shadows of the 
soviet union and the oppressive economic system deng xiaoping has 
tried to reform those who have died for freedom in china will truly 
have died in vain nixon said in an article written for the los 
angeles times syndicate and distributed by his office 
nixon said his journey to china in 1972 was denounced by both the 
right and the left and bush now faces criticism on both sides too 
those on the far right who oppose any relations with china will 
demand economic and diplomatic sanctions he said so will the 
human rights lobby which calls for punishing every regime that does 
not live up to our standards regardless of our interests or those of 
the millions living under those regimes whom sanctions would hurt 
the most 
the bush administration should continue to ignore these 
extremist voices and stay the prudent course it has already set 
he said 
bush has suspended military aid and limited contacts with the 
chinese government but has resisted demands in congress for more 
stringent sanctions secretary of state james a baker iii told a 
house committee that bush is taking targeted steps avoiding 
inflammatory rhetoric and preserving options for future action 
nixon said that is the correct course the chinese got along 
without the west for a quarter century and they could do so again 
he said if we force them back into their angry isolation from the 
west we risk prompting a potentially disastrous entente between the 
two great communist powers 
the expresident said that would serve moscows interests but no 
others he said soviet president mikhail gorbachev knows well that a 
freeze between washington and beijing would hasten the thaw he seeks 
with china 
whatever happens in the future it is imperative that 
sinoamerican relations remain strong so the united states can help 
maintain the balance among china japan and the soviet union 
nixon said 
he said some americans have gone overboard on china seeing 
rapprochement as a romance 
china has a limitless capacity to fascinate he said but 
it is not disneyland it is as it has been since 1949 a communist 
dictatorship held together by brute force 
no one who knows china should be surprised when its leaders 
turn to violence to pursue their political goals nixon said 
they have done far worse before tiananmen square

sen lloyd bentsen said saturday he will 
propose cutting the surtax medicareeligible americans pay for the 
new catastrophic illness insurance and said the senate finance 
committee also will consider making the program voluntary 
despite opposition from the bush administration bentsen says 
hes backing a substantial cut in the medicare catastrophic 
socalled supplemental premium that is based on income 
the finance chairman raised the possibility of cutting the tax 
several months ago if projections of large surpluses in the 
catastrophic fund were borne out however he previously had stopped 
short of saying he actually would propose a rollback 
enacted less than a year ago the catastrophic tax has been under 
heavy fire from many older americans in upperincome ranges and 
those who receive catastrophic insurance protection paid by the 
current or former employers 
bentsen said the panel will meet in july to consider reducing the 
tax as well as making catastrophic health care coverage voluntary by 
linking it to part b of medicare the physician payment program 
that is financed 75 percent with general federal tax money 
since enacted this year the catastrophic tax is estimated to 
produce a surplus of 2 billion to 4 billion bentsen said 
i just dont think that the government ought to be making a 
profit off of the patients or the beneficiaries of this program or 
to use that surplus to try to balance the budget said the texas 
democrat 
so ive set a hearing for july that will cover these points and 
to decide whether it should be made voluntary again and in turn 
ill be recommending a substantial cut in the premium bentsen 
said 
under the senates original plan beneficiaries would have been 
able to drop medicare coverage of physician fees and catastrophic 
insurance but by the time the bill was finally approved the 
catastrophic coverage was mandatory 
bentsen has yet to announce his position on the issue of making 
catastrophic coverage optional 
the surtax this year is 15 percent of a medicare beneficiarys 
federal income tax of 150 or more 
it is currently estimated that 59 percent of all beneficiaries 
will pay no supplemental premium in 1989 above the 4 basic fee 
bentsens office said 
only 56 percent will pay the maximum surtax set this year at 
800 bentsens office said 
the surtax is scheduled to be phased in through 1993 by then it 
could reach 28 percent of a beneficiarys federal income tax of 150 
or more 
during the five years ending in 1993 the congressional budget 
office now estimates the surtax is likely to bring in about 10 
billion more than is expected to be paid for catastrophic benefits 
but administration officials have cautioned that the surplus may 
never exist because the new program of catastrophic drug benefits 
starting in 1991 could cost far more than previously estimated

on the surface it is life as usual in beijing 
beneath the surface there is fear of sudden arrest of the knock 
on the door that means imprisonment or worse here is a report on 
beijing by an ap correspondent who reported on the prodemocracy 
demonstrations and the army crackdown

tiananmen square has been scrubbed clean of the 
blood and ashes that stained it the night of june 34 when 
thousands of soldiers crushed studentled protests for a freer 
society 
the only signs of the violence are watchful soldiers brandishing 
automatic rifles bullet holes in walls and scars left in the road 
by marauding army tanks 
the burnedout hulks of hundreds of public buses and army trucks 
have been towed away new flower beds and freshly painted traffic 
dividers and garbage bins adorn the 100acre square still closed to 
the public 
many chinese say its only window dressing 
on the surface its calm but below that its very tense 
said a college student in beijing who participated in the 
demonstrations at tiananmen many people are worried they might be 
arrested like me 
more than 1600 have been arrested since the crackdown began and 
27 people have been executed 
the government has demonstrated an ability for surveillance never 
so chillingly revealed in 40 years of communist rule television 
news has shown secretly shot videotapes of people authorities say 
spied for taiwan chinas longtime enemy 
most scenes were of tiananmen square where the accused were 
shown watching marches along with hundreds of thousands of other 
people 
the message seemed to be that anybody could be on those tapes 
and anybody could be charged with being a counterrevolutionary 
resignation and sullen indifference have replaced the grassroots 
fervor that initially stopped the tanks of the peoples liberation 
army from advancing on beijing 
many businesses still are running at halfpace and much of 
beijings usual floating population of 1 million peddlers and 
outsiders looking for work has retreated to the countryside 
only about half the normal number of people are here said a 
sales clerk at the dongan market on the normally jammed wangfujing 
shopping street nobody is coming in from the provinces 
tibetan merchants who once hawked monkey skulls tiger and bear 
paws and other animal parts for medicinal uses outside a foreigners 
compound have disappeared 
scarlet banners calling for people to support the communist party 
and respect the army flutter from hotels construction cranes and 
overpasses 
a month ago westerners in beijing were symbols of freedom and 
hope 
america is great people would say heartily flashing 
thumbsup signs your democracy is the best in the world 
crowds would part to let foreign journalists see insulting 
caricatures of chinese leaders or photograph corpses after the june 
34 violence which official chinese reports say killed 200 to 300 
people including many soldiers chinese witnesses and western 
intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as 
3000 
an ap reporter who was chased and shot at by two soldiers for 
photographing marching troops was cheered by a crowd when he emerged 
from a parking lot where he had been hiding behind a van 
now foreigners are shunned 
commuters wheeling their bicycles past memorials for two soldiers 
killed in the crackdown edged away uneasily when an american 
approached large signs tell how the two soldiers were thrown off 
bridges and when they didnt die set on fire by angry mobs 
witnesses said one soldier had shot to death a child and the 
other had shot unarmed adults 
please dont sit here a customer at an allnight restaurant 
asked a westerner they see us talking to you and theyll haul us 
in 
the proprietor of a nearby restaurant was bolder inviting an 
american to sit down and chat moments later a platoon of soldiers 
marched by and its officer said get these tables off the 
sidewalk theyd better be gone when we come back 
let them come back what do we care said the manager but he 
moved the tables 
most people have become accustomed to the soldiers who stare 
blankly out from under their helmets as they stand guard at street 
corners or patrol boulevards and back alleys 
im just eating i dont care about them said a young man at 
a restaurant on changan avenue beijings main thoroughfare they 
mind their business and i mind mine 
newscasts continue to show army officers workers and even 
students denouncing the prodemocracy movement and there are signs 
the propaganda campaign is working 
there were a certain number of bad elements on the streets 
said a 67yearold man who has been repairing shoes on sidewalks for 
50 years the soldiers arent after me theyre not after you 
theyre after the evildoers 
but nonbelievers are legion 
not a single shot was fired in the square and not one person 
died there said a hired driver reciting the government line 
thats all were allowed to say 
those who were on the streets or within earshot of the thunderous 
rifle reports of june 34 say they will never forget 
this used to be our square of democracy a college student 
said looking across tiananmen toward the great hall of the people 
now its their square of dictatorship

a us military court on saturday 
sentenced an army soldier to 30 years in prison for passing 
sophisticated defense secrets to communist east germany 
spec 4 michael a peri had pleaded guilty to espionage charges 
during his courtmartial and could have received a maximum sentence 
of life in prison 
the judge col craig c jacobsen said during sentencing that 
under a pretrial agreement peris term would be reduced to 25 years 
for good behavior during the first three years of confinement 
peri 22 of laguna niguel calif showed no emotion as jacobsen 
read the sentence the soldiers parents fred and winnie peri 
bowed their heads 
after the sentencing peri was led in shackles to a van that 
whisked him away officials said he would be taken to a detention 
center in mannheim 
the case automatically goes to a review panel and must be 
approved by the us armys 5th corps which has clemency power and 
can reduce the sentence 
the courtmartial also stripped peri of his rank ordered that 
all pay and benefits be forfeited and gave him a dishonorable 
discharge 
peri had also pleaded guilty to several lesser charges including 
being absent without leave and entering a restricted zone without 
permission 
in final arguments saturday chief prosecutor maj michael d 
graham said peri just flat sold out his country 
he kissed off his friends he kissed off his family he kissed 
off his unit and then he kissed off his country graham said 
peris civilian defense lawyer michael christensen countered 
he had courage to come back to face a life sentence and is 
probably as courageous as any soldier in battle 
in testimony friday peri broke down in tears and pleaded for 
forgiveness he said he received no money from the east germans 
when his courtmartial opened wednesday peri pleaded guilty to 
charges he gave crucial information on us electronic defense 
capabilities to east germany 
peri worked as an electronic signal interceptor in the s2 
intelligence section of the 11th armored cavalry regiment in fulda 
part of the us armys v corps he disappeared from his unit feb 
20 and crossed the border into east germany with a small computer 
and discs containing classified information 
peri voluntarily returned march 4 and was arrested 
in court friday peri said he came back because i couldnt 
handle leaving my parents behind my friends behind taking what i 
had coming was better 
under questioning from his military attorney maj william g 
stokes peri cited job pressures and a lack of privacy in army life 
as the reasons for his actions stokes declined to comment on the 
sentencing after saturdays hearing 
peri said that during his stay in east germany communist

a stringent air cleanup plan considered by 
some a model for the nation has been shelved at least temporarily by 
state officials who fear it wont work unless it gains wider support 
the state air resources board citing mistrust between regional 
air quality officials and business and environmentalist leaders 
voted 61 friday to postpone action on the plan for 60 days 
im troubled by the perceptions of this plan i continue to hear 
from business and local government said jananne sharpless the 
boards chairwoman 
the plan would cut emissions from vehicles businesses and 
residences about 80 percent in an effort to make the air in southern 
california healthy again by 2007 it would also place restrictions 
on the use of such consumer products as aerosol sprays and barbecue 
lighter fluids 
officials of the south coast air quality management district 
which encompasses los angeles county and three counties to the south 
and west have estimated the plan would cost 26 billion a year 
business estimates have placed the cost as high as 12 billion 
in delaying a vote the board ordered the district to outline how 
it plans to account for the costs businesses will face the board 
also wants to know how cities and counties will be persuaded to 
cooperate in enforcement 
we have to ensure this plan can be implemented ms sharpless 
said we want a plan that works 
if adopted by the state board appointed by gov george 
deukmejian the plan also would require approval from the federal 
environmental protection agency 
ms sharpless who is deukmejians environmental affairs 
secretary said the governor did not advise her to reject the plan 
but said he wanted the concerns of business better addressed 
the governor is concerned about the impact on the economy

residents of denvers northern suburbs are 
coexisting a little more uneasily with rocky flats nuclear weapons 
plant these days but say an investigation at the facility is cause 
for concern not hysteria 
were all concerned naturally said omar joseph who has 
lived and worked in arvada for 23 years what are you going to do 
as a citizen you just hold your breath and hope for the best 
were not panicky by any means said earl mcguire of 
broomfield we are mad for the simple reason that i think were 
being lied to 
the investigation was made public june 6 when 75 fbi and 
environmental protection agency agents raided the plant 16 miles 
northwest of denver the onscene inquiry wound up last week 
authorities have said it will take at least six months to analyze 
the evidence collected during the twoweek search 
an affidavit filed in denver us district court alleges that 
hazardous wastes were burned illegally in a plant incinerator and 
were dumped late last year into creeks feeding into water supplies 
for broomfield westminster thornton and northglenn 
a group of 16 antinuclear and peace organizations has demanded 
that gov roy romer close the plant other groups such as the 
denver medical society supported romers successful effort to give 
the state authority to more strictly monitor the plant which is 
under federal contract 
the probe has had little visible effect on daytoday life in the 
nearby suburbs of broomfield westminster and arvada where 155000 
of metropolitan denvers roughly 16 million residents live 
but people in those suburbs are concerned particularly about the 
safety of their water city leaders and residents say sales of 
bottled and distilled water systems are up 
my gut feeling is that the people in broomfield have accepted 
it and the city has been very responsive said marty miller 
editor of the weekly broomfield enterprise newspaper im getting 
more letters over an animal impound issue we have here than over 
rocky flats 
weve been in broomfield since 1964 and weve known rocky flats 
has been there all along said resident larry cooper our water 
supply is always in jeopardy because we are so close to it 
i really expected a lot more panic he said everybody is 
concerned everybody knows rocky flats is there lets make sure we 
know what theyre doing there and lets clean it up 
i think theres a group that certainly is concerned about the 
overall environmental safety taking a waitandsee attitude to see 
what the investigation will produce said westminster city manager 
bill christopher there also is a silent element that is not 
expressing concern not jumping up and down not demanding the 
closure of the plant not very concerned with whats been in the 
media 
there also is a very small vociferous group that is demanding 
the closure of the plant and weve heard from those people for the 
last few years he said 
established in the early 1950s the plant a large complex of 
buildings surrounded by a buffer zone the whole site covering 11 
square miles manufactures triggers for nuclear weapons it has 
been a source of controversy in the metropolitan area for two 
decades 
whenever public safety concerns surfaced the federal government 
reassured the public that the facility posed no health threat a 
wave of concern erupted in 1957 when a fire and explosion in a 
plutoniumreprocessing building released an undetermined amount of 
plutonium into the atmosphere and again in 1969 when a fire caused 
about 70 million in damage 
in the 1970s thenjefferson county health director dr carl 
johnson began studies of the plants impact he later published 
papers in which he claimed the cancer rate among nearby residents 
shot up in the 1960s and 1970s 
today about 5000 people work at the plant and many live in the 
nearby towns which were established primarily as bedroom 
communities recently the towns have taken steps to attract 
business and industry and diversify their economic base the plant 
is managed by rockwell international corp for the department of 
energy 
the news of the latest investigation initially triggered hundreds 
of calls to the broomfield city offices which opened a hotline to 
reassure citizens that tests proved the water was safe but a week 
or so later no one addressed the issue during a city council 
meeting 
mcguire said he purchased bottled water after learning of the 
alleged contamination but his family is returning to tap water 
because of uncertainty over what type of elements are in bottled 
water 
laurie kappler who has lived in broomfield for five years and 
has drunk tap water during that time said its not going to make 
a difference to buy bottled water now 
as far as what has happened we will probably go on living our 
lives the same way as before said david smith president of the 
broomfield chamber of commerce as far as business and economic 
development is concerned the damage has been done 
were not born with four arms out here he said this is 
not a war zone

chinas communist party fired its moderate leader 
zhao ziyang on saturday and replaced him with a shanghai party boss 
who moved swiftly to quell prodemocracy protests in his city 
the new general secretary of the 47millionmember party is jiang 
zemin 62 a universityeducated technocrat who has served as mayor 
and party secretary of shanghai chinas largest city 
the first three executions following the crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement occurred in shanghai 
the party also purged hu qili who shared the 69yearold zhaos 
sympathy for the studentled movement for a freer society and served 
with him on the politburo standing committee the nations 
highestranking political body 
zhaos status had been in limbo for more than a month he was 
last seen in public when he met with student protesters whose 
7weekold movement was crushed in a crackdown that began june 3 
the partys 276member central committee also removed zhao from 
the 17member ruling politburo and its standing committee from the 
175member policymaking central committee and from the central 
military commission 
he apparently was allowed to keep his party membership 
a party communique released by the official xinhua news agency 
said that at a critical juncture involving the destiny of the 
party and the state comrade zhao ziyang made the mistake of 
supporting the turmoils and splitting the party and he had 
unshirkable responsibilities for the shapingup of the turmoils 
the party said it will maintain its policies of reform and 
greater openness with the rest of the world it also pledged to work 
for greater democracy and an end to corruption the main demands of 
the student protesters 
the report on zhaos ouster was read by his rival premier li 
peng who joined with senior leader deng xiaoping to consolidate the 
power of hardliners determined to use force to crush the 
prodemocracy movement 
zhao reportedly was stripped of power after opposing dengs 
decision to declare martial law in beijing on may 20 zhao was last 
seen in public the day before when he made a dramatic tearful 
visit to students on a hunger strike in tiananmen square 
the partys communique said he took a passive approach to 
opposing bourgeois liberalization or support of western ideas and 
gravely neglected party building 
it acknowledged however that zhao did something beneficial to 
the reform the opening of china to the outside world 
the communique did not accuse him of being a 
counterrevolutionary a charge leveled at many of the 1800 
civilians arrested since the crackdown began the government has 
executed 27 of them 
zhao gained national acclaim with his rural reforms in sichuan 
province in the late 1970s he became a deng protege and was named 
premier in 1980 he was appointed party general secretary in 1987 
succeeding the late hu yaobang 
hu another deng protege was purged following accusations that 
he was soft on student demonstrations hus death april 15 triggered 
the latest round of demonstrations 
jiang a university graduate who spent time in the soviet union 
in the 1950s and speaks russian and english served as electronics 
industry minister and in various other technical posts before being 
named mayor of shanghai in 1985 he relinquished that position to 
become shanghai party secretary last year 
like zhao he is comfortable around foreigners and has backed 
chinas opendoor policy by working to attract foreign investment to 
help revitalize shanghais antiquated industrial base 
politically however he is considered a hardliner 
during the student protests he tried to censor shanghais world 
economic herald then chinas most liberal newspaper and he moved 
quickly to stifle unrest in shanghai that followed the military 
crackdown in beijing 
jiang is believed to be the soninlaw of li xiannian a former 
president and one of the old guard hardliners who rallied behind 
dengs decision to suppress the student movement with force 
jiang also joined the politburo standing committee which was 
expanded from five to six members 
replacing zhao and hu qili were jiang tianjin mayor li ruihuan 
and economist song ping who heads the party organization department 
the other members of the standing committee are qiao shi the 
party security man who had been widely pegged to succeed zhao 
conservative economist yao yilin and premier li 
the party shakeup was not expected to have any immediate effect 
on its policy of promoting foreign investment and expanding chinas 
economic relations with other countries 
the central committees communique said china must not return 
to the old closeddoor path 
while it said the party must work for democratic and legal 
reforms it demanded loyalty to conservative ideals the party must 
carry out education in patriotism socialism independence and 
selfreliance plain living and hard work and oppose bourgeois 
liberalization in real earnest the committee said 
the communique said the politburo met from monday through 
wednesday and the central committee which makes all decisions on 
leadership positions met on friday and saturday

before turning the gun on himself a 
14yearold boy wrote a note to his mother saying that shooting his 
12yearold brother to death was a nightmare authorities say 
mom i accidentally shot clay its a nightmare so i killed 
myself read the note that damien bienash left on the back of a 
cash register receipt on the dining room table 
the oneline statement was found when the boys mother judy 
bienash 36 returned home thursday afternoon and found the bodies 
of her sons damien and clay 
police and rock countys chief deputy coroner richard messner 
concluded that the deaths were a murdersuicide although friends and 
relatives of the victims disputed the notion 
authorities said a quarrel over baseball cards may have led 
damien to shoot his younger brother with a gun that had been a gift 
to the older boy from his father 
there are only two people who could tell us why it happened 
and they are both dead police lt larry loveland said 
but christine dunham an aunt said friday that the incident 
was an accident a total accident it is not like them at all 
they loved each other too dearly they always looked out for each 
other 
according to police reports clay was shot basically square in 
the face indicating the shot from damien may have been aimed a 
knife was found near clays right hand and there were signs 
including a large fan that was tipped over that indicated there may 
have been a struggle messner said 
a number of baseball cards were found on the floor near clays 
feet 
police said the boys were quarreling over baseball cards before 
their mother left earlier in the day 
clay apparently was an avid baseball card collector 
loveland said and damien grabbed a handful of them that may not 
have been the cause of the shooting but thats the last thing the 
mother saw 
apparently they had had altercations off and on messner 
said i think they were awfully good kids but had altercations a 
little more often than normal 
messner said a singleshot 20gauge shotgun a gift to damien 
from his father was used in the shootings the parents are 
divorced the boys aunt said the boy had taken a hunter safety 
course 
the deaths coupled with a shooting in milwaukee on thursday 
evening in which a boy critically wounded a friend while playing 
with a gun led to renewed calls at the state capitol for a 
floridastyle gun law 
the law passed last week in florida after a spate of child 
shootings there imposes penalties on adults who allow loaded weapons 
to come into the hands of children and allows authorities to 
prosecute the adult for a felony if a childs play with a weapon 
results in death or injury

pressure on syria to lift its siege of the christian enclave

aoun ordered a blockade of illegal ports run by syrianbacked 
militias south of beirut 
syria keeps 40000 troops stationed across 70 percent of the 
country under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate 
moslem and christian governments have been competing for power in 
lebanon since september when outgoing president amin gemayel named 
aoun head of an interim christian cabinet

pledged allegiance to acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni

a volunteer firefighter says he and a 
friend firebombed a small chemical plant with gasoline they got from 
the fire station because they believed the plant was harming the 
environment 
he said in a police affidavit that he did not intend for the 
blaze to get out of hand 
michael a legge 19 a probationary volunteer for the bethany 
fire department was in jail saturday unable to post 40000 bail 
his friend brian s golembowski 22 a selfemployed landscaper 
also of bethany was free after posting 30000 bond following their 
arraignment friday on charges of firstdegree arson conspiracy to 
commit firstdegree arson and firstdegree reckless endangerment if 
convicted they could face maximum prison terms of from 12 to 46 
years and fines of 21000 each 
neither man has yet entered a plea golembowski has denied parts 
of legges version given to police 
the fire early monday at carbolabs inc in rural bethany spewed a 
cloud of noxious smoke that forced the evacuation of as many as 200 
people and sickened 14 firefighters who were treated for 
respiratory complaints one firefighter was hospitalized 
the arsonists did more environmental damage in one hour than we 
did in 22 years of business said dr philip pivawer a carbolabs 
owner 
legge who lives threequarters of a mile from carbolabs said in 
the affidavit that he telephoned state police to report the fire as 
soon as he got home early monday morning because he did not want the 
fire to get out of hand 
legge was questioned by state police after the resident trooper 
in bethany identified his voice on the tape recording of the call 
made to report the fire the trooper recently had arrested legge for 
an unspecified offense 
golembowski told police he was with legge when he prepared 
several homemade bombs known as molotov cocktails but he said he 
refused to take part in the firebombing or to even drive legge to 
the laboratory as legge said occurred 
attorney steven ecker who represented golembowski at his 
arraignment told the court that what might have begun as a game 
or a prank indeed escalated into something serious 
legge said in the affidavit that before making the molotov 
cocktails they went to the fire station to pick up a twogallon can 
of gas used to run emergency generators a search of legges home 
turned up two red gas cans marked bvfd for the bethany volunteer 
fire department

the united states must step up its attention to 
such environmental issues as drought management infrastructure 
repair global warming and solid waste disposal to mitigate the 
pollution that threatens its people an administration report says 
we must do better president bush said putting in a plug for 
recycling of wastes in a message accompanying a report by the white 
house advisory council on environmental quality 
the 420page report urged movement on the controversial issue of 
global warming on which some in the administration have cited 
differing scientific opinions and shown reluctance to accept dire 
predictions regarding the socalled greenhouse effect 
the report put together over a twoyear period and forwarded to 
congress late friday states that the government might find it 
necessary to plan future projects considering climate change even 
before all the uncertainties are known 
bush said significant strides have been made by the federal and 
local governments as well as the private sector to address 
pollution and environmental degradation with such steps as auto 
emissions standards 
but we can do better he wrote in a message to congress 
that is why we are committed to cleaner air in the nations 
cities he said noting that he has proposed a clean air package 
to deal with acid rain airborne toxics and autoproduced smog 
in addition he said this country must make every effort to 
stem the rising tide of garbage and industrial waste through a more 
aggressive use of waste minimization and recycling practices 
bush said recycling should start with separation of garbage in 
homes and in local communities 
the report an assessment of the nations environmental status 
for the years 198788 drawn from a variety of agency and military 
studies and scientific reports makes clear the bush administration 
will not assume the full burden of environmental protection it 
calls on state and local governments as well as business to share 
the responsibility 
for instance more than half the nations municipal landfills 
make no attempt to control water pollution resulting from the 
runoff of rain water from their sites the report says less 
than half impose restrictions on receipt of bulk liquid wastes 
these and other practices suggest that a large portion of landfilled 
municipal solid waste ends up in places where it might contaminate 
ground water 
it notes further that the country has thousands of old dumping 
sites in the middle of residential areas and that the federal 
governments superfund cleanup program will share responsibility for 
only a handful of them 
regarding the nations infrastructure the report says such 
facilities as navigation channels and ports flood control works 
mass transit systems water supply wastewater and solid waste 
facilities are barely adequate to fulfill current requirements and 
insufficient to meet the demands of future economic growth and 
development 
given the experience of the 1988 drought in which extensive 
dredging and water control management was required to keep inland 
waterways open for commerce the report notes that formal planned 
drought management has not been a major federal focus and that it 
will be an important water resources issue in the future 
the report takes a cautious approach to the greenhouse effect in 
which carbon dioxide and other gases in the earths atmosphere trap 
radiant heat near the planets surface in addition to natural 
buildup the gases have increased dramatically because of burning 
coal oil and gas as well as the destruction of tropical rain 
forests 
in light of the massive economic upheaval that would be caused if 
the government found it necessary to declare war on the greenhouse 
effect the administration has taken the position that evidence is 
inconclusive on whether the trend is as serious as some analysts 
have found 
noting the disagreements the ceq report says the scientific 
evidence is evolving on the extend of global warming and its 
potential impact on weather patterns 
it may be necessary however to plan future projects 
considering climate change even before all the uncertainties are 
known the report said in the interim support of necessary new 
research and thorough evaluation of ongoing and completed research 
is needed 
the threemember council on environmental quality was established 
in 1970 to advise the president on environmental matters and has few 
statutory powers one of president reagans first acts was to slash 
its staff and the council did little during his presidency 
bush so far has not shown an inclination to raise the councils 
profile however environmentalists were heartened when the 
president tapped michael r deland to be its new chairman he was 
the boston area administrator for the environmental protection 
agency and is known as a strong environmentalist

56hour 2030mile trek from the southeastern city of sao paulo to 
natal federal police officer luis fernando borges santos told the 
associated press by telephone from estancia 
they were riding along a high ridge when the road simply gave 
way beneath them said borges santos who assisted rescue workers 
at the scene a hole the diameter of two buses opened up and 
sucked them down the drop its pitch black out on that highway 
the drivers probably never saw a thing 
its a miracle anyone survived at all he said 
one driver was killed and the other was pulled from the wreckage 
by rescue workers santos said 
a rescue team of 50 civil and federal police and firefighters was 
digging through the mud in search of bodies and possible survivors 
weve pulled 31 mutilated corpses from the mud and we think 
there must be dozens more buried underneath said santos he said 
no foreigners were on board the buses 
tv film footage on globo tv the nations largest commercial 
network showed helmeted rescue workers with spades and hoes hacking 
through earth and pulling mudcovered bodies from the wrecks 
firefighter carlos enrique de oliveira told the ap that heavy 
rains in the region over the past week probably caused the highway 
to fall away 
that region is hilly and the earth beneath on both sides of the 
drop that runs alongside the highway was already loose and 
crumbling said de oliveira the rains turned the ground into 
putty

in 20 years of running roughshod through new york 
as a tenants rights activist bruce bailey turned landlords into 
enemies he turned drug dealers into enemies but he also turned 
friends into enemies 
one of his enemies murdered and dismembered bailey on june 14 
police are still trying to determine which one 
we know there are a lot of people who dont like him said 
detective chief joseph g demartino who is heading the 
investigation into the slaying that ended baileys twodecade tenure 
as an upper west side gadfly 
bailey 54 was on his way to a tenants organization meeting when 
he disappeared parts of his body were found a day later in several 
garbage bags in the bronx with his limbs and head severed police 
acting on a tip searched a staten island landfill saturday for the 
head 
one fact is crystal clear to those who knew bruces life and 
work this is no random act of violence said a statement issued 
by his wife nellie hester and their two children this was a 
deliberate political murder no different from the acts of a death 
squad in el salvador 
we strongly believe that some real estate thug found as all 
the others have that bruce couldnt be bought couldnt be 
frightened couldnt be discouraged but he could of course be 
killed 
his slaying produced an outpouring of grief and support from some 
of the people he assisted a bouquet of five roses was left outside 
the door of the columbia tenants union which bailey headed 5 
roses from apt 5e read the card 
he saved our building and many others the building was a 
disaster before he came in and he helped us put it back together 
said esther bishop of the 125th street tenants group that bailey was 
scheduled to meet the night he was killed 
while bailey was praised by many others suggested his protenant 
work was just a way of exploiting an issue for personal gain 
bailey has been in new york since his college years when he 
transferred to columbia university after a year at ohio state 
university he joined the columbia tenants union in manhattan a 
short time later at the time of his death he was its chairman and 
only paid staff member 
when bailey first became active in tenants rights you could 
count on bruce to show up with the troops recalled former state 
assemblywoman marie runyon a onetime bailey associate who wound up 
at odds with him 
he soon gained a reputation as someone willing to take on a 
fight organizing rent strikes filing lawsuits and ripping 
landlords as vicious and treacherous as they battled 
headtohead 
but there was a darker side to bailey he was accused of 
antisemitism by holocaust survivor and fellow columbia union member 
john ranz who was later shoved down a staircase by two men at 
baileys order bailey was convicted of the crime and given a 
sixmonth sentence which he never served 
bailey was also the target of a probe by the state attorney 
generals office after tenant union members alleged that he was 
misusing funds of the notforprofit organization no charges were 
ever filed 
while his work initially focused on columbia universityowned 
buildings bailey had expanded his efforts to include buildings in 
drugravaged sections of the city harlem and washington heights 
were also included 
bailey began infuriating drug dealers used to operating without 
any interference the day he disappeared bailey had been in 
suburban scarsdale trying to persuade a landlord to evict drug 
dealers from a manhattan building 
it wasnt surprising to anyone who knew bailey that he took them 
on the same way he handled everyone else 
bruce was not wellliked by anyone except the tenants he was 
working for said attorney douglas kellner who represented 
tenants in six baileyorganized buildings 
and kellner like the bailey family believes his friends life 
work might have led to his death when he was informed about 
baileys disappearance kellner immediately thought the worst 
i was very concerned because we were working on several 
projects where landlords were capable of using violence he said

william althaus the republican mayor of 
york pa spoke too soon when he explained last week why city 
leaders of both parties agreed on the need for higher federal taxes 
and why their annual meetings had become such dull bipartisan 
affairs 
theres always a little partisanship he said but not as 
much as there used to be the cuts in federal programs for 
cities over the past seven or eight years have pulled us together 
by the conclusion of the annual us conference of mayors a few 
days later in this historic seaport they still agreed on taxes and 
urban spending but partisanship had flared openly in a way not seen 
among the local leaders since the early years of the reagan 
administration 
the leading republican mayors didnt bother to show up for a 
closing news conference they were licking their wounds from a 
bruising battle over electing future leaders for the group that saw 
althaus the loser of an unprecedented partylines vote 
and their meeting seemed to demonstrate that political bitterness 
after the upheaval in house leadership will spread to other levels 
the mayors meeting had slid into partisan argument with the 
arrival of republican national chairman lee atwater who said he had 
targeted the new york mayoral race as a way to establish a 
political beachhead in the cities 
even some republican mayors were left complaining about its 
partisan tone and that it was the kind of speech appropriate for gop 
workers not a gathering of mayors where the majority was 
democratic 
new york city mayor edward i koch arriving the next day hadnt 
sat down yet when he unleashed a bitter assault on atwater calling 
him a amoral pathological and engineer of vile tactics 
democratic national chairman ron brown followed with an attack on 
atwater as purveyor of oil spill tactics taking politics to 
its worst extreme 
but democratic mayors were left with a dispute among themselves 
too and it cut to the heart of how they want to be advocates for 
the nations urban problems in the bush administration 
the incoming president of the conference kathryn whitmire of 
houston used the meeting to voice optimism about the bush 
administration being more attentive to urban problems than the 
mayors feel reagan was she said of the bush administration 
officials who spoke after hearing from them we are optimistic 
that our issues will be on their agenda 
but the mayors who select their president two years in advance 
pushed aside althauss republican candidacy to be future president 
of the group and elected bostons ray flynn who is among the 
sharpest critics of the bush administration among the mayors 
that there was a contested election at all was unprecedented in 
the long history of bigcity mayors meetings flynn immediately made 
clear he didnt think whitmire would be a tough enough critic of the 
administration and that the debate had been over how agressive 
bigcity mayors want to be in pressing their case with washington 
where whitmire had praise for the bush officials flynn said 
pointedly i didnt think they had much to say about anything we 
cant sit back and applaud that kind of rhetoric theres too 
much of one big happy family 
lost in the mayors meeting was any real airing of the scandals 
plaguing the department of housing and urban development the agency 
that handles most federal urban spending and which is engulfed in 
allegations of political favoritism fraud and embezzlement from the 
previous administration 
whitmire who is in a tough reelection battle in bushs home 
town said she wasnt interested in debating any past abuses and 
would look to the future 
flynn said revelations that the limited money for housing may 
have been squandered just leave everybody depressed there was 
also much concern voiced privately that the investigative trails 
would lead into other hud programs popular with mayors 
former secretary sam pierce who directed hud throughout the 
reagan administration has never been popular with mayors and he 
had no defenders at this meeting 
hud has not been very sensitive to americas cities flynn 
said anybody tht says hud has been in the corner of americas 
cities for the last eight or nine years doesnt know what theyre 
talking about

floridas second annual alligator 
hunt has drawn more than 20000 applicants or about three times 
what last years hunt drew 
we were a little bit surprised i estimated we would get 
double but not triple last years applications said dennis 
david alligator program coordinator for the florida game and fresh 
water fish commission 
david said 20361 people applied before the june 15 deadline 
leaving about 80 hopefuls for every permit to be granted 
the commission brought back gator hunting in limited numbers 
after a 25year ban when alligators were counted as an endangered 
species they now number over a million and have become a nuisance 
in some areas 
about 250 to 300 trappers will be randomly selected by a 
computerized lottery for the 30day hunt in september 
last year a computer sorted through 5800 applications to select 
the 238 trappers that were given hunt permits 
hunters are allowed 15 gators each florida residents selected in 
the lottery must pay a hunt license fee of 250 the fee for 
outofstate residents is 1000 
last years trappers bagged 2988 alligators 582 alligators 
short of the hunts allotted amount 
the game commission made one significant rule change for the 
second hunt after receiving complaints of brutality toward 
alligators trappers are now required to kill their captured quarry 
immediately instead of binding live alligators until they are 
delivered to a meat processor

the defense department is investigating the 
billing practices of the boeing co on research and development 
costs for government contracts the company said 
meanwile a separate investigation by state and federal 
inspectors is focused on health and safty concerns at topsecurity 
boeing facilities 
boeing spokesman paul binder declined to provide details of the 
billing practices probe but he did confirm friday that an 
investigation is under way 
we have supplied documents and we are cooperating in the 
investigation he said 
the seattle postintelligencer reported in saturdays editions 
that it has obtained internal boeing memos that say the company is 
under subpoena from the defense department to preserve certain 
documents between jan 1 1979 and aug 31 1988 
the subpoena is currently so broad that virtually all boeing 
aerospace and electronics contracts proposals associated files 
technical documentation working files notes etc can be subject 
to being requested by the government the memo said 
it was dated june 7 and distributed to key employees telling them 
that none of the documents in question should be destroyed or 
removed 
a memo dated june 13 named the target as the sea lance program 
an antisubmarine weapon boeing is developing for the us navy the 
postintelligencer reported 
both memos referred to the probe as a criminal investigation by 
the defense department 
this year boeing was awarded 85 million for research and 
development of the sea lance a conventional warhead being developed 
to attack submarines at long range from surface ships and other 
submarines 
the sixyear contract potentially worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars was first signed in 1986 
boeing which receives billions of dollars from the federal 
government for defense contracts annually is routinely audited by 
the departments defense contract audit agency if irregularities 
are found in any procedures the agency can refer the matter to its 
own investigative branch or to the appropriate armed service 
scott reedal agent in charge of the defense departments defense 
criminal investigative service in seattle declined to answer 
questions regarding the investigation 
bill whitlow an analyst with dain bosworth in seattle said 
boeing is considered an ethical defense contractor but he said 
that doesnt mean the company would be immune from improper billing 
theres always a risk that somewhere in the many programs they 
have and the thousands of people involved that someone is going to 
slip up he said 
in another development a seattle official in the federal 
occupational safety and health administration said the health and 
safety investigation has been under way since may 18 
richard terrill assistant regional administrator for osha 
declined to say what prompted the investigation at the boeing 
developmental center binder the boeing spokesman said the company 
strives to have a good health and safety program 
its almost a given that theyre going to find something wrong 
they dont come in to tell us whats right he said 
steve valandra spokesman for the states industrial safety and 
health division said osha was asked to help perform the safety and 
health review with state officials because state officials have had 
trouble getting security clearance in the past

jiang zemin the new leader of the worlds largest 
communist party has been a leader in efforts to open chinas 
economy to the world but he opposes political reform 
jiang 62 on saturday was named general secretary of the 
47millionmember communist party of china he replaces zhao ziyang 
who was ousted in disgrace for expressing sympathy for the 
prodemocracy movement 
jiangs selection to the nations most powerful post came as a 
surprise to many china watchers although he has the experience and 
the right political stance for the job he lacks a power base 
his base is his popularity but in china thats not enough 
said one chinese source in hong kong who is familiar with jiangs 
family he has no organizations behind him like the military or 
the state security organs 
if the senior leaders want him to do something hell have no 
choice 
jiang has been party secretary of shanghai chinas largest city 
and a member of the 17member politburo the partys top 
decisionmaking body 
from 1985 until last year he was mayor of shanghai aggressively 
promoting it as a financial and foreign investment center and 
tackling the daunting transportation and housing problems of the 
city of 12 million 
jiang is politically hardline and economically liberal said 
the chinese source 
he likes good food and dresses well too he is very smooth 
very suave a likable man 
among the joint ventures jiang has brought to his city are the 
shanghai hilton one of chinas most luxurious hotels he has also 
worked with prescott bush brother of president bush to establish a 
golf course in shanghai the source said 
jiang made an impressive showing last month when he played host 
to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev during gorbachevs visit to 
the city the two talked about economic reforms 
he has a combination of suaveness but also a history of 
managing difficult situations that undoubtedly recommended him for 
this job said lynn white an instructor at princeton university 
and visiting scholar at the university of hong kong who spent the 
second half of 1988 in shanghai 
white said jiang lost some popularity among shanghai citizens for 
representing beijing at least as well as he represented them 
and for his recent moves against the world economic herald chinas 
most liberal newspaper before it was shut down in may 
jiang moved swiftly to arrest protesters and quell demonstrations 
that broke out in shanghai after the military crackdown in beijing 
on june 34 the first chinese condemned for participating in the 
protest movement were three shanghai men who were executed wednesday 
the chinese source said jiang was supported by his two relatively 
liberal predecessors zhao and the late hu yaobang and has always 
had a good relationship with intellectuals 
his ties with zhao and intellectuals were strained however 
after jiang moved to censor the world economic herald and its editor 
qin benli the source said 
jiang was born in july 1926 in yangzhou city near shanghai and 
joined the communist party in 1946 
a year later he graduated from the electrical machinery 
department of jiaotong university in shanghai 
he worked as a trainee at an automobile factory in the soviet 
union in 1955 then returned to china the next year to become deputy 
chief engineer for dynamic mechanics at a plant in northeastern 
china and deputy director of the shanghai electrical equipment 
research institute 
jiang like most bureaucrats of his generation apparently was 
purged from office during the 196676 cultural revolution he 
reappeared in 1980 as a senior official in the state administration 
commission on import and export affairs and the state administration 
commission on foreign investment 
he went on to be named minister of electronics industry and in 
1985 returned to shanghai as mayor and deputy secretary of the party 
committee 
in 1986 during student demonstrations in shanghai he went to 
his alma mater and seeing a poster with chineselanguage excerpts 
from lincolns gettysburg address surprised students by reciting in 
english from the speech 
but he also told students they only knew the words and not the 
essence of the american presidents speech and later criticized 
students for their superficial knowledge of the west 
the source in hong kong said jiang has limited understanding of 
russian according to official profiles he reads romanian french 
and japanese and is fond of music and literature 
he is said to be the soninlaw of li xiannian chinas former 
president and one of the old guard hardliners who have supported 
senior leader deng xiaoping in the suppression of dissent

the government raised gasoline prices 10 
percent saturday and blamed the increase on marxist guerrillas whose 
twoyear sabotage campaign has cost the oil industry 375 million in 
lost export revenues 
union leaders said the move would increase inflation one 
opposition politician said the government should halt terrorism not 
raise prices 
the increase boosted the average price of regular gasoline from 
195 pesos 52 cents to 215 pesos 57 cents a gallon and premium 
gas from 243 pesos 65 cents to 267 pesos 75 cents the minimum 
wage is 32000 pesos 85 a month 
there was no other alternative left to avoid depriving the 
government of the resources needed to pay for social programs 
energy minister oscar mejia vallejo said in a nationwide television 
broadcast announcing the increase 
colombias rich eastern oil fields are jointly operated by the 
stateowned conglomerate ecopetrol which holds 50 percent of the 
shares and occidental and dutch shell which control 25 percent 
each 
since the guerrillas of the national liberation army began their 
sabotage campaign the oil industry has reported 104 terrorist 
attacks 
the guerrillas want the government to nationalize the assets of 
occidental and dutch shell and have said the attacks on oil 
pipelines will continue until the government allows a public debate 
on nationalization 
earlier this week comptroller general rodolfo gonzalez said he 
favored a dialogue with the guerrillas that would include ways of 
improving the revenues colombia receives from its partnership with 
occidental and dutch shell 
mejia vallejo estimated export revenue losses at 375 million 
since the guerrilla attacks began two years ago just as colombia 
began exporting oil 
the latest and most devastating dynamite attack knocked out the 
pump station at covenas port on june 16 halting daily exports of 
200000 barrels 
repairs are not expected to be completed until at least midjuly 
most of the guerrilla attacks have occurred on the 487mile 
pipeline between oil fields in cano limon near the venezuela 
border and covenas port 
about 420000 barrels of oil have spilled over the mountainous 
region since the guerrilla attacks began according to mejia vallejo 
several union leaders said saturday the increase in gasoline 
prices will worsen inflation already running at an annual rate of 
136 percent 
another critic was bogota mayor andres pastrana of the 
opposition conservative party impotent before terrorism the 
government has decided to pass on to the colombian people the cost 
of this madness he said

river the locals understandably got concerned 
i think its going to die fretted vincent perez 15 as he 
stared down into the murky waters the only thing you see in here 
is garbage cars and shopping carts 
the shoreline at east 96th street was filled friday with police 
journalists and concerned citizens all peering offshore 
i called 911 said john soto 41 who lives nearby id 
hate to see a dolphin get killed by these speedboats and circle line 
boats 
those who know say the dolphin seemed to be doing just fine 
one expert said the visitor can easily dodge boats as long as its 
sonar is working and louis garibaldi director of the new york 
aquarium figures the dolphin is contentedly feasting on marine 
munchies such as black bass and herring which also yes its true 
live in the waterway 
garibaldi said a staff member came to the area wednesday when the 
dolphin was first reported sighted 
it looks like its most likely a whitesided dolphin he said 
it appears in good health and has no trouble swimming 
his staff advised police and others to leave the dolphin alone 
and he noted that harassment of a marine mammal is against federal 
law 
a woman who answered the phone at the aquarium saturday said that 
officials there are monitoring the dolphin but she wasnt sure if 
they had seen it saturday

plo chief yasser arafat on saturday 
offered to mediate a political solution to the civil war in 
neighboring afghanistan a guerrilla leader said 
after a 30minute meeting with arafat at islamabad international 
airport guerrilla leader gulbadin hekmatyar said the provisional 
government established by the insurgents will vote on arafats offer 
hekmatyar is foreign minister of the government which the 
usbacked moslem guerrillas plan to install in afghanistan if they 
oust the marxist government 
arafat later told pakistans national assembly i have 
discussed with all the parties to this conflict our own 
initiative he did not elaborate 
a spokesman for the palestine liberation organization said 
earlier that arafat supported a neutral government made up of 
technocrats and independent of the communists or the moslem 
insurgents 
in the past guerrilla leaders have rejected the neutral 
government proposal 
but the plo representative in pakistan ahmad abdul razzaq al 
salman said it is very important that they change their views 
the guerrillas began fighting in 1978 after the communists took 
over in a coup soviet forces entered afghanistan a year later to 
bolster the communist government and stayed for nine years 
moscow completed the withdrawal of its troops in february 
the soviets are gone said ahmed abdul karim elhih 
palestinian consul general in pakistan the reason to fight is 
over 
however the guerrillas who have headquarters in pakistan and 
iran say the war will continue until they oust the afghan 
government 
they have refused to negotiate with president najib and his 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
in a release issued late saturday by the guerrillacontrolled 
afghan news agency hekmatyar said he told arafat the soviets should 
stop supporting najib and sending weapons to his forces 
i also told him that the mujahedeen do not accept the idea of 
sharing power with najib hekmatyar said 
but elhih said the insurgents should relent why not talk to 
your enemies if you have courage to fight you should have courage 
to talk he said 
he said both sides had approached arafat about mediating and that 
the plo leader met earlier with representatives of najib and the 
guerrillas 
arafat who was welcomed at the airport by prime minister benazir 
bhutto previously visited pakistan in march then he laid the 
cornerstone for a palestinian embassy and met with guerrilla leaders 
guerrilla sources said at the time that the meeting accomplished 
little arafat urged the insurgents to push for a political solution 
to the war instead of a military one 
the guerrillas rejected the idea 
during this pakistani visit arafat also discussed the 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip telling the national assembly it will end only after israeli 
troops withdraw 
he called on the united states to press for an international 
peace conference with the plo as a full partner in negotiations 
israel has rejected such a proposal 
ms bhutto said following arafats speech it is clearly not 
the palestinian people who want to see the conflict continue but it 
is those who do not believe in freedom and peace who have used arms 
to terrorize 
a plo official said ms bhutto made a personal donation of 
50000 to the uprising in april

the damaged tanker exxon valdez was towed 
saturday through the often stormy gulf of alaska but there was no 
sign of stress at critical points and no significant dribbling of 
residual oil near the ship 
the 897foot tanker ran aground three months ago on bligh reef 
ripping large gashes in its hull and releasing nearly 11 million 
gallons of heavy north slope crude oil into prince william sound 
causing the nations worst oil spill 
the vessel was refloated two weeks after the accident and towed 
25 miles to an already soiled anchorage near naked island there 
divers and salvage crews made it seaworthy for the 2500mile trip 
to a san diego shipyard where it is scheduled for 25 million in 
repairs two oceangoing tugs began towing the huge tanker out of 
alaska waters early friday 
the procession was halted about four hours friday night for a 
final coast guard inspection before leaving the hinchinbrook 
entrance and proceeding into open water officials said 
the strain gauges aboard the vessel showed no stress joe 
tucker an exxon spokesman in valdez said saturday there was no 
trace of oil on or near the boat 
observers who earlier had watched the procession lift anchor 
under gray and gloomy skies reported a light film of oil trailing 
the virtually empty tanker but the coast guard released a statement 
prepared by exxon that generally discounted the seriousness of those 
observations 
a light sheen was observed coming off the exxon valdez for a 
few minutes after the ships departure said coast guard 
spokeswoman brenda toledo who quoted from the statement 
it was believed that most of that sheen was a biomass 
microorganisms or algae plus an insignificant amount of oil 
that washed out of the open tanks during turbulence as the vessel 
got under way the statement said 
the sheen was very thin too thin for skimmer boats to pick up 
officials said some of it was recovered by absorbant pads 
officials said 
the coast guard has said this was not considered serious and 
not unexpected toledo read 
all discharge has stopped she said there has been none 
since the initial startup 
the vessels have been moving at about 6 knots and were to slow to 
an average speed of 5 knots as they continue toward southern 
california officials said

a tiny rotating blade device was inserted 
surgically and used to slice away plaque to unclog a patients heart 
artery in a firstofitskind procedure a doctor at st luke 
medical center said 
cardiologist frank cummins said lawrence alfson 58 was the 
first patient in medical history to undergo an atherectomy in which 
an experimental blade device is used to clear plaque from a blocked 
heart artery 
cummins said he inserted the tiny blade device which was 
attached to a long tube into an artery in the patients leg and 
maneuvered it carefully to the heart 
the rotating blade sliced away the plaque which was then sucked 
out of the artery by a vacuum attached to the device the procedure 
successfully restored blood flow to alfsons heart cummins said 
the hope is that if you actually remove the plaque from the 
artery it wont narrow down again cummins said 
alfson said he had bypass surgery 10 years ago and a vein from 
his leg was grafted to the heart since then he has twice undergone 
angioplasty the use of a balloon to open the clogged blood vessel 
alfson said the experimental atherectomy took about two hours 
friday and was relatively painless he remained hospitalized 
saturday but the st lukes declined to release a condition report

last year southern africa was 
ablaze with wars in angola mozambique and namibia that all seemed 
to defy a solution today namibia is on the road to independence 
angola has a ceasefire and there are moves afoot to begin peace 
talks in mozambique 
each conflict has been fueled by separate forces but a common 
ingredient for the improved regional climate has been south africas 
campaign to mend relations with its longhostile neighbors in black 
africa 
since august south africa has 
withdrawn its troops from angola where they fought 
intermittently since 1975 alongside the rebels of the national union 
for the total independence of angola unita the rebels and the 
marxist angolan government reached a ceasefire agreement last week 
that took effect saturday 
begun implementing a unsupervised independence plan in 
namibia the territory south africa has ruled for 74 years 
held a series of toplevel meetings with mozambique and offered 
financial assistance to help repair the countrys wardevastated 
economy 
blackruled nations remain skeptical of south africa saying the 
countrys policy of apartheid at home and its destabilization 
campaign abroad caused the regional turmoil 
but there has been a sharp reversal in the political tides since 
the middle of 1988 when conflicts dating to the 1960s and 1970s 
appeared ready to escalate again 
those who were part of the problem yesterday are now part of 
the solution mozambican president joaquim chissano said friday 
night after returning from an african summit in zaire where the 
angolan ceasefire was announced 
to make myself clear i dont think the south africans will go 
back on their word in angola or namibia chissano was quoted as 
saying by the national news agency aim 
in may 1988 the heaviest fighting in the angolan war was 
reported around the southeastern city of cuito cuanavale angolan 
government troops backed by cuban soldiers fought the combined 
unitasouth african forces to an apparent standoff 
the cuban troop strength in angola had surpassed 50000 and south 
africa acknowledged 3000 soldiers moreorless based in angola 
faced with an expensive openended conflict and mounting white 
casualties south africa apparently decided to leave angola peace 
talks between south africa angola and cuba but not unita began 
in late may 1988 
south africa completed its withdrawal from angola in august in 
december the three countries signed a regional peace accord that 
called for south africa to halt aid to unita and to grant 
independence to namibia in return cuba has agreed to a phased 
troop withdrawal 
unita meanwhile continued to fight for a powersharing 
agreement until the ceasefire was announced zambias president 
kenneth kaunda called the agreement a great moment for africa 
the rival angolan parties still face difficult negotiations but 
a commission elected at the summit plans to oversee the integration 
of unita into the current oneparty state 
in namibia a 23year bush war waged by the southwest africa 
peoples organization or swapo against south african rule appears 
over 
an estimated 10000 swapo supporters celebrated the accord on 
saturday with a rally and swapo leaders said that we must now 
wage peace 
south africa announced saturday it was down to 1500 troops in 
namibia a week ahead of the un deadline under the territorys 
independence plan south africa had an estimated 50000 soliders in 
namibia before the independence plan took effect april 1 
the independence plan almost fell apart the day it began when 
more than 1000 swapo guerrillas crossed into northern namibia in 
violation of the regional peace agreement 
more than 300 guerrillas and 27 securityforce members were 
killed but the fighting has stopped and preindependence elections 
are planned for november independence is expected to come early 
next year 
zambias kaunda one of south africas harshest critics in the 
past said black african states would consider strengthening ties 
with south africa if namibian independence goes smoothly 
with tangible successes in angola and namibia southern african 
leaders have turned their sights toward the regions most active 
conflict mozambique where the marxist government has fought the 
rebel mozambique national resistance since 1977 
zimbabwes president robert mugabe whose troops support 
mozambican government forces said the plan to end the angolan war 
could have parallels for mozambique 
although the two wars differ in some ways the angolan peace 
talk principles deserve the attention of the mozambicans he was 
quoted as saying friday by zimbabwes ziana news agency i am sure 
something will unfold soon 
mozambiques chissano said he hoped the angolan agreement would 
encourage the rebels to take up an amnesty offer in effect since 
january 1988 
more than 3000 rebels out of a force estimated at 12000 to 
22000 already have accepted the offer according to government 
figures 
on saturday chissano said president mobutu sese seko of zaire 
had agreed to act as a mediator between the government and the 
guerrillas the portuguese news agency lusa reported 
chissano has refused to negotiate with the rebels but his 
government has quietly encouraged unpublicized talks between local 
church leaders and the rebels according to sources in mozambique

the arrest of highranking military officers inside 
cuba appear to be linked to a recent drug case here a federal 
prosecutor said 
meanwhile the bush administration is considering lodging a 
formal request with cuba to interview gen arnaldo ochoa one of the 
officers charged in that country the miami herald reported saturday 
cuba says ochoa and 10 other officers and government officials 
worked with the colombiabased medellin drug cartel taking money 
from traffickers to allow them to use the island as a way station 
for smuggling into the united states 
us prosecutors say the names of some of the officers now in 
custody in cuba surfaced in a 1987 probe of a smuggling ring that 
culminated in two indictments and a 1988 trial 
it is clear that these cuban arrests are substantially 
connected to information generated at this trial said us 
attorney dexter lehtinen he refused to identify the officers 
one of the miami cases involved hugo ceballos a venezuelan who 
was convicted on a 10count indictment last year that accused him of 
bringing cocaine through cuba to the florida keys 
in march reinaldo ruiz and three others pleaded guilty to a 
related 27count indictment they are awaiting sentencing ruiz 
allegedly headed a caribbeanbased smuggling ring that involved 
cuban military officials 
the only cuban official publicly named in the ruiz case was 
fidel an apparent reference to castro who ruiz on a 
secretly recorded videotape claimed was pocketing bribes from 
smugglers to use cuban territory 
the money went right in fidels drawer ruiz boasted to an 
undercover agent on the tape he also said he landed at military 
airports and had drugladen boats escorted through cuban waters by 
military torpedo boats 
the information revealed by ruizs guilty plea may have had 
reprecussions inside cuba lehtinen said 
that information was quite good and probably embarrassed the 
cuban government lehtinen said they have arrested some of the 
people identified in that case 
during the investigation an undercover agent flew into cubas 
varadero air base escorted by cuban migs and used cuban military 
frequencies according to federal authorities 
the miami herald reported saturday that the bush administration 
is considering a request to cuba to allow us investigators to 
question ochoa 
quoting unidentified us officials the herald said justice 
department and drug enforcement administration investigators are 
interested in matching the cuban information with their own files

the communist leadership chose prominent 
reformer rezsoe nyers as party chairman on saturday and appointed 
him to a new fourman ruling body that is dominated by advocates of 
democratic change 
the action by the policymaking central committee erodes the 
power of party general secretary karoly grosz who sought a middle 
ground between hardliners and reformers 
the central committee created a fourmember presidium comprised 
of nyers grosz and two other prominent reformers politburo member 
imre pozsgay and premier miklos nemeth spokesman laszlo major said 
in a statement relayed on radio television and the state news 
agency mti 
the four will lead the party on a provisional basis until a 
crucial party congress set for oct 7 when communists will choose 
who will lead the party as hungary prepares for its first free and 
competitive elections next year 
the choice of a leader at the congress is considered crucial to 
the partys attempts to hold power when the elections are held 
the promotion of nyers to the largely symbolic party chairmanship 
and the inclusion of nyers pozsgay and nemeth in the presidium 
indicate reformers won a protracted internal battle with 
conservative communists 
nyers an economist inherits the chairmanship from janos kadar 
who was named honorary party chairman when grosz took over as 
general secretary just 13 months ago kadar 77 leader of hungarys 
communists for 32 years was stripped of the chairmanship last month 
grosz has lost standing recently as the split between reformers 
and hardliners left him little middle ground several party reform 
groups called publicly for his ouster 
but only four of the 92 speakers at the closeddoor central 
committee session demanded grosz step down major said and he 
retained his title of general secretary 
his inclusion in the new leadership suggested the reformers had 
been forced to compromise with disgruntled conservatives who are 
still powerful in the party 
the first act of the new leadership late saturday was to revamp 
the nineman party politburo expanding its membership to 21 and 
renaming it the political executive committee mti said 
the makeup of the new politburo also struck a balance between 
reformers and conservatives including all nine members of the old 
body along with important reformers such as foreign minister gyula 
horn 
reformers showed their strength in achieving the ouster of janos 
berecz a former chief ideologist who lost his politburo seat in 
april from the influential rank of central committee secretary 
berecz will head a new party ideological institute major said 
saturdays changes seemed designed to prevent an open party split 
before the oct 7 party congress 
the reformers believe that only the communists most democratic 
policies give the party hope of emerging as the strongest force in 
next years elections a split now could ruin the partys chances at 
the polls against opposition groups 
hungary also is trying to boost its image in the west as a stable 
economic partner before president bush visits next month 
the communists are negotiating a timetable and regulations for 
the elections with the opposition and promised last week that the 
opposition would be able to review proposed election laws before 
they are considered by the communistdominated parliament 
nyers was also named to head the partys delegation to the talks 
pozsgay and two moderates make up the rest of the delegation mti 
said 
the promotion of nyers 66 seals a stunning comeback in east 
bloc politics after pioneering economic reforms in the late 1960s 
nyers was ousted from the politburo in 1973 after apparently pushing 
too hard for more changes 
nyers made it back to the politburo when grosz took over in may 
1988 at the head of a revamped leadership that also gave pozsgay a 
politburo seat 
it was not immediately clear how much power nyers will have as 
party chairman he told the independent daily mai nap on friday that 
he would not want to be a mere symbolic figure if given the post

hundreds of people lined the shore on 
saturday clutching binoculars to see if their fears of an 
environmental disaster in rhode island sound had been realized 
what they saw a wounded oil tanker barely a mile offshore 
listing and ringed with coast guard boats left many with feelings 
of resignation or anger 
diane collins sat on a lonely rock outcrop alternately staring 
at the world prodigy which leaked more than 1 million gallons of 
heating fuel when it struck a reef friday and scanning the water 
hoping not to see any of the fuel washing ashore 
im pretty devastated myself because if something hurts the 
earth it hurts me too i worried about the alaska one too but 
this is right on our doorstep she said 
at a nearby state park spectators were lined along the road by 5 
am watching the process of unloading the tankers remaining oil 
if the oil comes in on our beaches there goes the beaches 
said joanne burns 
her husband bryan who said he could remember three or four 
tankers running aground during the past 50 years was resigned to 
it as long as youre going to have an economy 
but thats a little close his wife said pointing to the 
ship 
word that the greek captain had failed to pick up a harbor pilot 
before navigating the treacherous entrance to narragansett bay 
sparked some anger 
guys like that ought to hang i have no mercy for people like 
that said steve ellis of newport 
the ship was not inland far enough to require a pilot but some 
officials said it was unwise of the captain to operate without one 
its kind of a gray area out there said chief warrant 
officer jerry alfred a coast guard marine safety investigator 
when the valdez happened i said to myself its a wonder it 
doesnt happen around here with all the traffic that comes up and 
down the bay ellis said but its probably going to happen 
again some day with this coastline the way it is and the amount of 
traffic 
i think they learned a lot from the valdez that its not wise 
to sit around and wait for the company to clean it up 
the water is literally orange in some places where the waves 
are breaking said chip young a spokesman for the environmental 
group save the bay

today seems to be a business as usual day said rosenberg 
a lot of people dont even know the spill is around here 
he said theyre on vacation either theyve been out all morning 
and havent listened to the news havent picked up a paper or 
maybe they arent as concerned about this as we would like to think 
they are 
gov edward d diprete said he thought the effects of the spill 
on tourism would be temporary 
by and large it should not affect tourism he said 
the marriott and the sheraton islander both located in downtown 
newport were fully booked manangers said

the nations only law requiring aids 
testing for a marriage license needs only gov james r thompsons 
signature to be off the books 
the legislature sent a repeal measure to thompsons desk on a 
3323 senate vote late friday 
a spokesman for thompson said the governor had not decided 
whether to sign the bill which was approved in the house last month 
on a 6548 vote 
sen william marovitz the bills sponsor said that louisiana 
the only other state to have adopted such a law already had 
repealed its statute he also noted that such groups as the illinois 
state medical society were opposed to the testing requirement 
this is a lowrisk population marovitz said referring to 
couples applying for marriage licenses 
the state department of public health said that through midjune 
44 people had tested positive for exposure to the aidscausing virus 
out of an estimated 221000 marriagelicense applicants who have 
been tested since the requirement started in january 1988 
this is not good public health policy marovitz said the 
key to this disease is education getting people to come in 
voluntarily and be tested 
theres nothing in the law should we pass this bill that will 
bar someone from having an aids test he said 
critics countered that the premarital tests help monitor the 
spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome and reduce the chance 
of children getting the disease even though those testing positive 
for the aids virus can still marry 
that child is an innocent and we have a right to protect the 
children said sen adeline geokaris 
you eliminate the testing program you eliminate public 
awareness said sen jack schaffer i think we ought to keep the 
test going frankly i hope it never shows up a lot of positives 
the measure would also repeal the requirement that couples be 
tested for syphilis before getting married 
a study by public health officials estimated that the cost that 
engaged couples had to pay for testing and associated doctors 
visits was about 25 million over six months last year or 312000 
for each of the eight cases of infection identified during that 
period 
the authors of the study also noted that the state was losing 
thousands of dollars in revenue becauses illinois couples were 
traveling to neighboring states to get married to avoid paying for 
the aids tests

a black washington priest who announced plans 
to form a separate black catholic church said saturday he has been 
forbidden to celebrate mass or other church rites 
rev george stallings said he also was fired from his job as 
washington archdiocesan evangelist stallings said the notice was 
contained in letters from cardinal james hickey of the district of 
columbia archdiocese 
stallings said hickey told him i must urge you in the 
strongest possible terms to turn away from this fatal course 
stallings said he expected harsh criticism from hickey and other 
church officials because the move represents a schism with the 
organized roman catholic diocese stallings said hickeys letters 
labeled the move a significant step toward separating yourself 
from the catholic church 
stallings has not received any communication directly from the 
vatican said an associate who asked not to be identified stallings 
said however he was surprised by the wording of hickeys letters

charging the church with ignoring the spiritual and cultural 
needs of black parishioners stallings last week announced plans 
to form a new black congregation 
stallings said saturday he still plans to hold the first services 
of the new church july 2 we will consider it a catholic 
service he said 
stallings also said he plans to hire a bodyguard although he has 
received no specific threat i have no other choice but to think

israeli authorities claimed saturday that a us 
relief worker kidnapped in the gaza strip cooperated with his 
captors and a news report said officials were considering taking 
action against him 
chris george 35 codirector of the save the children 
foundation was freed friday about 30 hours after he was seized by 
gunmen he strongly criticized his captors 
repeated phone calls to georges home and office went unanswered 
saturday 
a close associate of georges at save the children who requested 
anonymity said george was away for the weekend and unavailable for 
comment on the israeli claims 
the associate said the government allegations and news 
organizations requests for comment had been relayed to george who 
was aware that a statement is expected from him 
reports that george was being investigated were broadcast 
throughout the day on governmentrun radio 
it is clear that george did not stage the kidnapping itself 
but he apparently cooperated with the abductors from the moment he 
was taken a senior israeli security official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the official said george named one of his abductors but declined 
to provide descriptions of the two others 
george told reporters after his release that he knew only one of 
his captors 
israel televisions arabiclanguage broadcast said security 
authorities were considering taking unspecified measures against 
george whom the radio described as being hostile toward israel 
leonard l lefkow a us embassy spokesman said he was unaware 
of the investigation and added this would be an israeli matter a 
matter for the israeli government 
george said he was lured outside his organizations gaza field 
office by three palestinian gunmen and taken away in a car 
george who spoke to reporters outside his home in the west bank 
town of ramallah after his release friday denounced the kidnapping 
as not only immoral but also a criminal act 
he said the kidnappers told him he was taken because he was a 
wellknown and important american and kept him locked in a room 
during the kidnapping but did not abuse him 
george whose group works with palestinian refugees identified 
one of his kidnappers as mohammed abu nasr 
he has come to the office for the last two years he wanted 
help in building a playground in the jabaliya refugee camp and we 
have considered the project but the work that he had done on the 
playground was stopped by the israeli authorities so the project did 
not get anywhere george said 
an israeli army statement blamed the kidnapping on terrorists 
linked to the plo the palestine liberation organization denied it 
was involved and had urged his release 
israeli security officials claimed george cooperated with his 
captors efforts to seek the release of jailed palestinian activists 
george said earlier his captors were demanding that israel 
release seven senior palestinian activists 
before releasing george the abductors gave him a 13page letter 
saying they carried out the abduction to draw world attention to the 
plight of the palestinian people and urging president bush to meet 
with plo chairman yasser arafat 
it was signed by abu nasr described as a 39yearold palestinian 
who was released from an israeli jail in 1985 in a prisoner swap in 
gaza palestinians said he is not known to be affiliated with any 
political faction 
israeli television in a report saturday night quoted security 
officials as saying they were checking the possibility george 
assisted his abductors in presenting their demands and even 
expressed identification with their stand

west virginia gov gaston caperton says 
he will continue his efforts to end a 2monthold strike of the 
pittston coal group despite the companys decision to reject his 
offer to help 
caperton on friday offered to mediate negotiations between united 
mine workers president richard trumka and pittston co chairman paul 
douglas 
douglas declined saying federal mediators would be better suited 
to handle negotiations federal mediators had been meeting with both 
sides before the union dropped out of the talks on june 7 
im deeply disappointed that pittston coal has decided not to 
accept our offer to assist in seeking a solution to the coal 
strike caperton said in a statement issued late friday 
but i am not ready to discontinue my efforts to end the 
conflict between pittston and the unite mine workers it has too 
farreaching an effect on too many families and communities for me 
to give up 
trumka had agreed to the meeting before douglas turned down the 
offer 
union miners went on strike at pittston operations in virginia 
and west virginia on april 5 last week the umw also began a strike 
at the companys kentucky holdings 
at issue are wages and benefits the 1900 striking miners contend 
are unfair 
pittston is one of the relatively few mining companies that does 
not currently have a umw contract 
capertons offer also was aimed at ending wildcat walkouts by 
44000 miners in 10 states at companies that do have umw contracts 
those strikes which the union says it has not sanctioned have 
spurred sporadic incidents of violence though the situation saturday 
was generally calm 
many mining companies shut down for two weeks in the summer as 
part of their contract with workers one vacation period began 
saturday morning and ends july 9 two other vacation periods are to 
follow companies chose one of the three periods 
vacation shutdowns mean wildcat strikers will get a break since 
there wont be anyone working at the mines to picket said 
district 17 field representative harold porter 
pittston has staggered vacations so its mines continue running 
he said 
the estimated number of miners involved in wildcat strikes 
according to union and industry officials are west virginia 
16000 illinois 8500 pennsylvania 6900 alabama 5000 ohio 
2560 kentucky 2325 indiana 1750 virginia 755 missouri 
350 and tennessee 200

coast guard and cleanup crews battled 
strong wind and rough water saturday to survey and try to contain a 
250000gallon oil spill from a barge ruptured in a collision in the 
houston ship channel 
the winds of more than 15 mph with higher gusts prevented workers 
from surrounding the barge with containment booms until late 
morning chief petty officer mark kennedy said 
he said the panamanianregistered motor vessel rachelb collided 
around 620 pm friday with one of three barges being driven by a 
tugboat owned by coastal towing investigators have not determined 
who was at fault for the accident 
the collision ruptured and emptied three of 12 tanks on one of 
the barges and each tank was holding about 2000 barrels or 84000 
gallons of heavy crude oil kennedy said 
the first major oil spill in eight years in the ship channel came 
just a few hours after 1 million gallons of heating oil spilled from 
a tanker off rhode island 
after the remaining oil was pumped out of the damaged barge and 
it was towed away saturday authorities reopened eight miles of the 
channel they had closed from the area where it begins running inland 
to houston from upper galveston bay the 40footdeep channel 
continues through the bay southeast to galveston on the gulf of 
mexico 
the accident occurred in the bay where the ship channel 
intersects with the bayport channel as the tug headed inland and 
the other vessel a tanker whose cargo was not determined headed 
outbound officials said 
the tug operator fearing a worse spill if the barge overturned 
maneuvered it after the accident out of the deep channel until it 
was grounded in shallow water official said 
when the weather finally allowed a coast guard helicopter flight 
late saturday morning the aerial look showed the slick stretching 
two miles to the galveston bay shoreline between red bluff and the 
bayport channel kennedy said it was nearly continuous and about a 
mile wide at its widest point he said 
the barge owner hired a contractor garner environmental to 
contain and clean up the spill kennedy said workers laid booms 
around the barge and also to direct the flow of the spill away from 
shore and into the bayport channel 
it looks pretty good at this point if we can get it contained 
within bayport channel it should be fairly easy to clean up 
kennedy said some of the slick is already being driven into that 
area by the winds and rains so theyre just trying to funnel it all 
in 
kennedy said there had been no reports of damage to fish and 
wildlife 
fortunately this is an area of the bay where there are not many 
environmentally sensitive areas he said adding that the flow of 
the spill apparently did not endanger shrimp grounds or oyster beds 
in the bay 
the last major spill in galveston bay occurred in 1981 when the 
olympic gloria dumped about 7000 barrels of oil after a collision 
with a tanker

ribbons of heating oil drifted at least 20 
miles and washed onto rhode island shores saturday from a tanker 
that grounded in one of three accidents that together spilled as 
much as 335 million gallons of oil 
in the delaware river near wilmington del a uruguayan oil 
tanker carrying 28 million gallons of industrial heating oil ran 
aground saturday morning and its crew reported the spill as 16 
million gallons 
todd nelson a coast guard spokesman said there was no way to 
know exactly how much spilled because a significant amount of oil 
may have sunk we are going to go with that because we want to be 
ready to respond to a worstcase scenario 
in the houston ship channel at galveston bay texas about 
250000 gallons of heavy crude oil spilled from a tugdriven barge 
damaged in a collision with a cargo vessel friday evening 
the rhode island accident spilled 1 million to 15 million 
gallons of fuel authorities said 
together the accidents were the worst setback for the oil 
shipping industry since nearly 11 million gallons of heavy crude oil 
gushed into alaskan waters from the tanker exxon valdez causing the 
nations worst oil spill 
as workers began the delicate task of unloading the damaged 
tanker at the mouth of narragansett bay officials closed beaches 
and shellfishing beds and promised a criminal investigation 
im real angry said gov edward diprete who called out 
national guardsmen and prison inmates to help with the cleanup 
this amounts to gross negligence no question about it he said 
the greek tankers captain admitted making a mistake in plotting the 
530foot ships course before hitting wellmarked brenton reef in 
rhode island sound on friday afternoon 
the fuel that leaked from the tanker world prodigy off newports 
southern tip ranged from a light film to a thicker coating that 
turned the surf orange 
the oil which spread primarily north and west formed ribbons 
here and there that were difficult to track and contain said 
capt eric williams of the coast guards providence marine safety 
office some had been found in greenwich bay an inlet about 20 
miles north along narragansett bay 
the oil washed onto a sandy beach at beaver tail state park and 
rocky shores south of jamestown across from newport said chip 
young of the environmental group save the bay 
authorities closed several beaches along the bay and atlantic 
ocean coasts and banned shellfishing fishing and swimming in the 
bay because the light oil was potentially toxic said robert l 
bendick jr director of the state department of environmental 
management 
cleanup crews strung absorbent booms at sensitive coves and 
inlets extending a containment effort that began friday when booms 
were dropped around the ship the light refined oil dispersed 
rapidly which hastened evaporation but meant more booms more 
people its a logistical nightmare said george wilson vice 
president of clean harbors a cleanup company 
diprete called out 200 national guardsmen and 120 state prison 
inmates to help 
interior secretary manuel lujan part of a team sent by president 
bush to tour the area and assess the spills impact said 
technology is just not up to the job 
it could have been a lot worse than it was lujan said in a 
telephone interview upon his return to washington it was a big 
spill but im very pleased overall we do learn things and what we 
learned from the alaska spill was that a quick response is the best 
response 
things are very much under control now he said weve got 
it contained the ships not leaking anymore 
crews began unloading onto barges the estimated 55 million 
gallons of oil still on board the world prodigy pumping raised the 
ships bow from about 18 inches above the water to 8 or 9 feet 
coast guard officials said 
workers hoped to have the oil pumped out of the tanker in three 
days williams said 
its a very delicate balance right now you dont know what 
other internal damage has been done to the tanks said lt phillip 
biedenbender an offloading specialist with the coast guard 
thomas connell a spokesman for state attorney general james 
oneil said his office was preparing search warrants for the ship 
which was under federal control and would start a grand jury 
investigation monday 
diprete said lawsuits were more likely than criminal charges 
the result may have been criminal but the evidence that is 
there would point toward civil action he said 
in delaware nelson said the most immediate problem was that the 
oil has sunk 
we believe that theres a significant amount of oil that is 
below the surface this is so close to the weight of water that it 
may travel several miles before it surfaces 
theres just no possible way to contain that oil he said 
nelson said cleanup crews on the delaware will have to track the 
oils path as best they can and attack it when it surfaces 
containment booms were placed along creeks tributaries and bird 
sanctuaries around the spill in delaware new jersey and 
pennsylvania officials expressed relief that the oil was refined 
and therefore not as toxic as it could be 
lujan also toured the delaware spill at president bushs request 
that was supposed to be as big as the one in rhode island we 
flew over the whole river by helicopter but it didnt seem that 
extensive he said there is a lot of speculation that perhaps 
it is not even 200000 gallons its not a terrible one 
in texas the response to the friday night spill in the upper 
portion of galveston bay was hampered by high winds and seas spawned 
by numerous thunderstorms officials said 
but chief petty officer mark kennedy said the choppy conditions 
spawned by a tropical depression in the gulf of mexico were actually 
helping the cleanup efforts by saturday afternoon 
coast guard officials got their first aerial view of the 
milewide spill late saturday morning when winds receded enough to 
allow helicopter travel gusty winds and choppy water returned later 
in the day 
workers constructed a boom around the mouth of bayport channel in 
an effort to capture most of the slick which stretched two miles to 
the shoreline kennedy said

the military announced saturday it will shoot 
down private planes violating cuban air space on grounds they 
probably are engaged in drug smuggling 
an armed forces announcement also said a military honor tribunal 
was scheduled to convene sunday in the case of division gen arnaldo 
ochoa sanchez a decorated combat veteran accused of having links 
with a colombian cocaine cartel 
both announcements were published in granma the official 
newspaper of the ruling communist party 
earlier this week granma published a lengthy report of a drug 
scandal that led to the arrests of ochoa a brigadier general two 
colonels a lieutenant colonel a captain and a major 
the report on aircraft said cuba has been hospitable to caribbean 
air traffic but it now must act to stop drugsmuggling planes from 
using its airspace 
private aircraft often violate cuban airspace and refuse to 
land despite repeated warnings the statement said such 
irregular flights can only be explained as drug trafficking 
activity 
we will be obliged to shoot however disagreeable it might be 
at whatever aircraft refuses to obey orders to land for 
inspection it added

has been granting overflight permission almost automatically to 
commercial and private planes it also has allowed unauthorized 
flights to pass through its airspace for a variety of reasons

ochoa will go before a 47member military tribunal accused of 
disgracing the nation by allegedly collaborating with colombias 
medellin cartel in smuggling cocaine to the united states 
he was arrested june 12 cuba reported after his arrest that 10 
other military officers and government officials were accused of 
accepting bribes from drug traffickers 
us prosecutors have said the names of some of the officers 
became known during an investigation in miami of a cuban smuggling 
ring that led to two indictments and a trial in florida in 1988 
it is clear that these arrests of the cuban officers are 
substantially connected to information generated at this trial 
us attorney dexter lehtinen told the associated press in miami 
he did not identify the other officers the miami herald said the 
bush administration may ask cuba for permission to interview ochoa 
ochoa and the other defendants are accused of letting smugglers 
use military airports and of escorting drugladen boats through 
cuban waters 
us authorities said an undercover agent in the 1987 
investigation flew into cubas varadero air base escorted by cuban 
migs and used cuban military frequencies 
granma acknowledged on thursday that president fidel castro 
ordered the investigation that led to ochoas arrest after the us 
charges that cuba was being used as a transshipment point for 
cocaine 
the scandal the first public admission that cuba has been 
touched by the drug trade created an uproar in havana people 
mobbed news vendors saturday buying copies of granma before they 
could even reach the newsstands 
ochoa 57 is a veteran of the cuban revolution and was a field 
commander in angola in 1987 and 1988 he is one of only five 
officers to receive the medal of the hero of the republic of cuba 
granma in its report saturday portrayed him as a man obsessed 
with money and said a true revolution will never permit impunity 
we shall wash in an exemplary manner outrages like this one 
granma did not say if the military tribunal would meet in public 
session but an official of the foreign ministry said it must be 
in a large place because of the great interest this has generated 
the newspaper said among the members of the honor tribunal are 
four division generals 31 brigadier generals a vice admiral and a 
rear admiral 
the tribunal to be headed by division gen ulises rosales de 
toro will make recommendations regarding ochoa to the communist 
party and the government granma said 
one of the miami cases involved hugo ceballos a venezuelan 
convicted on a 10count indictment last year that accused him of 
bringing cocaine through cuba to the florida keys 
in march reinaldo ruiz and three others pleaded guilty to a 
related 27count indictment and are awaiting sentencing ruiz 
allegedly headed a caribbeanbased smuggling ring that involved 
cuban military officials 
the only cuban official publicly named in the ruiz case was 
fidel a possible reference to castro who ruiz on a secretly 
recorded videotape claimed was pocketing bribes from smugglers 
using cuban territory 
the money went right in fidels drawer ruiz boasted to an 
undercover agent on the tape he also said he landed at military 
airports and had drugsmuggling boats escorted through cuban waters 
by military torpedo boats

environmentalists and timber industry 
officials were unable to reach an agreement saturday over the 
conflicting needs of loggers and spotted owls 
members of oregons congressional delegation and gov neil 
goldschmidt spent the day questioning representatives from both 
sides environmentalists and loggers are battling over the future of 
oregons old growth forests where the dwindling population of 
northern spotted owls nest 
meanwhile at the state capitol a few blocks away hundreds of 
loggers millworkers and their families rallied in support of the 
timber industry 
many wore yellow ribbons symbolizing their view that the 
industry is being held hostage by environmental lawsuits over the 
spotted owl 
as far as theyre concerned if we turned the whole damned 
state into a park that would be dandy said state rep peg jolin 
whose husband works in sawmill 
estimated to number fewer than 6000 in the northwest the owl 
hunts and nests almost exclusively in the old growth forests that 
produce the logs most prized by the timber industry proposals are 
being considered that would designate the spotted owl a threatened 
species 
at the owl summit the timber industry found an ally in 
goldschmidt when he called for legislation to prohibit legal 
challenges in court once the administrative process was exhausted 
over national forest planning 
sen bob packwood rore opposed the idea saying the massive 
exxon valdez oil spill might have been averted if environmental 
groups hadnt been barred from court challenges over the alaska oil 
pipeline 
sen mark hatfield chairman of the meeting was unable to get 
the two sides to agree about how much old growth is remaining the 
timber industry maintains there are 75 million acres of old growth 
in oregon and washington the wilderness society says it is more 
like 21 million acres 
is there any way we can get these groups together to stipulate 
with some kind of consistency hatfield asked 
during the meeting larry tuttle oregon director of the 
wilderness society agreed to closely examine millions of acres of 
timberlands that lie between the old growth estimates in an effort 
to help free up some timber for immediate use 
goldschmidt challenged whether environmentalists were truly 
willing to compromise 
is it really possible for you folks to engage in a serious 
discussion of timber supply goldschmidt asked you keep taking 
away from the base 
the meeting was called by goldschmidt rep les aucoin dore 
and hatfield rore the wood products industry is the biggest 
single industry in oregon

government and rebel forces honored the 
first day of a truce saturday in the 14yearold war between the 
marxist government and westernbacked rebels a government official 
said 
hostilities have ceased but it is necessary to keep vigilance 
and be ready for combat so that the peace that has been launched 
becomes real and lasting interior minister francisco magalhaes 
paiva said 
angolans crowded around newspaper stands in luanda the capital 
looking for more details of the ceasefire accord that went into 
effect saturday two days after it was signed by president eduardo 
dos santos and rebel leader jonas savimbi 
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said it 
was difficult to tell if the ceasefire was holding because most 
fighting has been concentrated near the namibian border about 600 
miles south of luanda 
the rebel radio carried an announcement that the ceasefire was 
in place and angolas state radio broadcast an appeal to troops to 
put down their weapons 
the peace accord was reached thursday in gbadolite zaire during 
a summit of 20 african leaders 
vice foreign minister venancio de moura told luandas diplomatic 
corps on saturday that savimbi had tacitly accepted in gbadolite 
to voluntarily and temporarily withdraw his forces from angola 
diplomats said 
one diplomat also said de moura told them that savimbi wants to 
be a special counselor to the us government 
the portugese news agency lusa on saturday quoted unnamed angolan 
officials as saying savimbi could become angolas representative to 
the united states for a period of two years 
angola has been pushing for diplomatic recognition by the united 
states there was no indication the appointment of savimbi whose 
guerrilla movement was backed by the united states would lead to 
recognition 
media coverage of the gbadolite summit here was sparse and most 
angolans were unaware of the terms of the pact which calls for 
integration of rebel forces into angolan society and the creation of 
a national reconciliation commission headed by president mobutu sese 
seko of zaire 
zairean vice premier nimy mayabika delivered a message to dos 
santos on saturday and said he was in luanda to accelerate the 
implementation of the principles agreed on at gbadolite 
the guerrilla movement the national union for the total 
independence of angola controls areas in southeastern angola 
occupied by up to 3 million of the countrys 9 million people the 
group is known by its portugese acronym unita 
in reports on statecontrolled radio and television savimbi was 
referred to saturday as unita president in the past he was 
referred to as traitor judas or bandit leader 
the gbadolite summit was the first meeting between dos santos and 
savimbi since the battle for power broke out in 1975 shortly after 
angola gained independence from portugal 
mobutu long a savimbi ally and credited with a prominent role in 
the truce is to meet president bush in washington on thursday to 
discuss peace in southern africa said white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater 
unita backed by south africa and the united states has been 
fighting to share power with dos santos marxist popular movement 
for the liberation of angola which is supported by cuban forces and 
soviet arms 
the ceasefire follows usbrokered regional peace accords 
angola signed in new york in december with cuba and south africa 
under the accords south africa agreed to allow angolas southern 
neighbor namibia to gain independence under a un plan and halt 
aid to savimbis guerrillas in exchange cuba agreed to a phased 
withdrawal of its estimated 50000 troops backing dos santos 
government unita was not party to the agreement

the us air line pilots association says canadian 
investigators relied on fabricated and erroneous evidence when they 
probed the 1985 gander crash that killed 256 americans 
the charge is contained in a letter sent this week to the 
canadian aviation safety board which investigated the crash of the 
arrow air dc8 carrying us troops home for christmas from a 
peacekeeping mission in the middle east 
canadian investigators used a computer simulation to reconstruct 
the planes flight path which gave crucial support to the 
investigators theory that wing ice caused the aircraft to stall and 
crash after takeoff on dec 12 1985 
but harold marthinsen director of accident investigation for the 
us association said in the ninepage letter that he suspected the 
simulator used manufactured data 
it should be clear they simply conjured up their trajectory 
with faulty or perhaps more to the point fabricated data 
marthinsen said this simulation represents technical 
dishonesty at its highest 
in washington officials of the pilots association were 
unavailable for comment saturday 
the letter comes at a critical point in the saga of the worst 
aviation disaster in canada 
the canadian federal government is to receive a report within the 
next week from an independent investigator former supreme court 
justice willard estey appointed in march estey will appraise the 
probe and suggest whether a judicial inquiry is warranted 
a majority of five canadian investigating board members concurred 
with a final report issued in december but four dissenters said the 
plane did not stall and concluded an onboard explosion was probably 
at fault 
in his letter marthinsen wrote we have over 20 years of 
experience reading out hundreds of metal foil flight recorder 
tapes 
in all these years we have not seen such abuse of data as in 
this investigation the letter said the flight recorder was put 
in airplanes as a tool to assist accident investigators to arrive at 
the true causes of accidents they were not intended to allow 
conjecture which suddenly changes to factual conclusions 
the crash killed all eight crewmembers and 248 us military 
personnel on their way to ft campbell ky

president daniel ortega saturday 
defended the expropriation of three major sugar production 
facilities saying they planned to halt production 
the expropriations have been sharply criticized by the private 
sector 
the superior council of private business has accused the leftist 
sandinista government of forcing nicaragua into total 
radicalization and the nicaraguan union of agricultural producers 
formally broke ties with all governmentsanctioned unions and 
government agencies 
the government seized the sugar concerns wednesday saying they 
had adopted irresponsible attitudes in the face of the economic 
crisis confronting the country 
ortega saturday accused the business council and the sugar 
concerns of planning to halt production and said they were 
agents of the terrorist policies of the united states 
government 
on june 22 the government also took over three coffee 
plantations owned by its critics ortega accused the growers of 
trying to sabotage an economic austerity plan to reduce inflation 
which last year topped 20000 percent 
as part of the plan the sandinista government earlier this week 
ordered a 110 percent devaluation of the cordoba currency which 
sent prices of consumer goods and services skyrocketing 
at a meeting sunday in matagalpa 80 miles north of the capital 
coffee growers unanimously decided to withdraw from the national 
coffee commission they said the panel made up of government and 
private representatives had ruined the industry 
coffee like sugar is one of nicaraguas main export items and a 
principal dollarearner 
in june 1988 the sandinista government confiscated the san 
antonio sugar plantation and mills one of nicaraguas largest 
industries

an oil tanker from uruguay ran aground 
early saturday spilling as much as 16 million gallons of heavy 
industrial heating oil in the delaware river just south of here the 
coast guard said 
the ship has told us 16 million gallons said todd nelson 
a coast guard spokesman we are going to go with that because we 
want to be ready to respond to a worstcase scenario 
nelson said there is no way to know exactly how much has spilled 
because a significant amount of oil may have sunk the ship was 
carrying 28 million gallons 
earlier the coast guard had estimated between 100000 and 200000 
gallons of refined no 6 industrial heating oil had leaked from the 
presidente rivera 
claymont is just upriver from wilmington the most populated city 
in delaware wilmington does not get its drinking water from the 
delaware river 
blobs of oil roughly 1 feet to 10 feet in diameter were beginning 
to surface saturday night as far as 6 miles upriver and 7 miles 
downriver from the spill nelson said 
the first priority was to unload the ships cargo so that it 
could be floated back into the rivers channel with the high tide 
sunday morning nelson said workers could not unload the ship fast 
enough to meet the 7 pm high tide saturday 
after floating the ship workers can then concentrate on the 
cleanup he said 
the oil is not particularly toxic and we were told by our 
environmental people to be at least as mindful of doing physical 
damage to the marshes when placing the booms as being worried about 
any longterm damage from the oil said capt larry murdock who 
supervised the cleanup 
containment booms were placed along creeks tributaries and bird 
sanctuaries around the spill murdock said officials started with 
marshes on the new jersey side of the river because they thought the 
tide would take the oil in that direction 
the oil was already collecting on the delaware side of the 
shoreline nelson predicted it could pose a serious threat to birds 
were afraid its just a matter of time until birds are 
affected nelson said 
murdock said the cause of the accident was under investigation 
coast guard officials had not determined whether the leak had 
stopped 
interior secretary manuel lujan got an aerial tour of the spill 
and said it didnt appear as extensive as he had been told but the 
head of the environmental protection agency william reilly also 
toured the site and said the reason it didnt look so bad was likely 
because most of the oil had sunk 
its maddening and its frustrating said andrew altman who 
was among about 100 people who gathered to look at the dirty water 
america is drunk on oil and the government is asleep at the 
wheel 
the grounding at 445 am ripped open two tanks that contained a 
total of 5 million gallons on the bottom of the ship murdock said 
the remaining oil in the two tanks was being transferred to a 
barge alongside the vessel 
murdock said the ship was carrying 28 million gallons to sun co 
at marcus hook pa south of philadelphia claymont del is just 
south of the pennsylvaniadelaware border and across the river from 
new jersey 
although the ship was headed upstream murdock said it was 
pointed downstream after the accident the bow turned after running 
aground leaving the entire ship wedged on a sandbar 
coast guard lt jim weakley said the captain of the ship is raul 
de barrat weakly said a local river pilot was on board but he had 
no information on who was piloting the ship at the time of the 
accident 
weakley said sun oil hired a pollution cleanup contractor about 
540 am and that a coast guard pollution investigative team 
arrived at 630 am the coast guard boat arrived at 650 am 
it is a typical response time weakley said 
murdock said any crew members subject to the investigation would 
be investigated for drug or alcohol use

commander of the naval aviation schools command capt cl 
lavinder was officially reprimanded prior to his retirement and

navywide review of hazardous training and resulted in changes in 
procedures at the navy rescue swimmer school including a ban 
against touching students by instructors 
a pathologist concluded that mirecki had a phobia about being 
dragged underwater which triggered heart failure before he drowned

scandal that forced two cabinet ministers to step down 
a leftist coalition an alliance of the greek communist party and 
the eurocommunists rejected mitsotakis proposal to form a 
temporary coalition government to bring socialist officials accused 
of wrongdoing to trial before calling new elections 
in a powerbrokers position after receiving 28 parliamentary 
places leftist coalition leaders said they would also turn down 
papandreous overtures

composed of nonpolitical personalities acceptable to all political 
parties

parliament is scheduled to convene then it is dissolved and a 
caretaker regime takes over to lead the country to general elections

blaspheming islam with his novel and ordered him killed khomeini

serious we acknowledge and apologize for 
but the newspaper said it was proud of publishing the interview 
which it reported was a reprint of an interview with an american 
journalist

edge of the most hideous literary controversy of our time

journalists throughout the world have been trying to track down 
rushdie

sunday article a lurid and sensationalized account of the 
earlier interview
