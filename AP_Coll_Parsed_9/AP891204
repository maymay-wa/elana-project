a year after an earthquake smashed 
northwestern armenia into rubble the city of leninakan is a 
shantytown of mud and memories 
the garapetyans do laundry by boiling their clothes in a bucket 
on a tiny wood stove the stove also heats a makeshift cabin they 
built from remains of their former apartment building next door 
far above rain lashes the wallpaper of their old living room on 
the fourth floor which was exposed when the side of the building 
sheared off 
were afraid of living in a large building again meruzhan 
garapetyan said 
popular songs speak of the disaster of dec 7 1988 when an 
earthquake measuring 69 on the richter scale killed at least 
25000 people and destroyed the homes of 500000 more 
oh earthquake what have you done one asks why did you 
leave so many parents without their children you covered them 
with stones and dirt and left their parents in tears 
the armenian relief agency search says 20000 people still are 
missing 2000 of them children daily life is slogging through 
mud relying on relatives and wondering when normality will return 
a quake of 71 magnitude in the san francisco area on oct 17 
killed only 66 people damage was estimated at 7 billion but much 
of the destruction was cleared and service restored within weeks 
in leninakan armenias secondlargest city vartan oganisyan 
and his family of five live in a shack made from bits of sheet 
metal wood scraps tar paper and salvaged window frames 
other families crowd into halfshattered buildings construction 
huts army tents round mongolian yurts abandoned railway cars and 
even gasoline tanks fitted with doors and windows a few open 
cooking fires can be seen in the twilight 
electrical power is intermittent as armenia enters the bitter 
soviet winter 
children bundle up for classes in temporary unheated buildings 
they wake up crying at night and run from classrooms in fright at 
the slightest noise 
after school they play earthquake recreating the disaster 
in the muddy streets 
hundreds of people go to the huge city cemetery after work many 
graves are marked only by the flowers relatives leave 
sofik torunyan who lost both children was there on what would 
have been her daughters 20th birthday with a cake fashioned from 
carnations 
oh my young daughter oh my love she wailed holding onto 
a friend why didnt i die too so i would not have to live 
without you 
people struggle on helping each other hospitality and pride 
remain 
a dozen families share the only bathroom on their block that 
still works a boy paints the window frame in his familys shack 
visitors are offered coffee and sweets but often there is no 
electricity to boil water 
maria tumanyan who lives in the ground floor of a severely 
cracked fivestory building insists that were making great 
progress she concentrates on the vast stretches cleared of 
broken concrete and twisted metal not the rubble remaining 
the town of spitak was leveled kirovakan and 300 villages were 
shattered 
in leninakan which had 235000 residents the quake destroyed 
99 ninestory apartment buildings 10 schools and every factory 
officials said 
reconstruction has lagged badly nikolai i ryzhkov the soviet 
premier said in november that the crash program to rebuild in two 
years already was a year behind schedule meaning virtually nothing 
had been accomplished 
residents blame disorganization central plannings failure to 
supply enough building materials and a twomonth blockade of 
armenia by ethnic enemies in neighboring azerbaijan 
many foreigners building schools and hospitals went home because 
supply shipments were held up on rail lines in azerbaijan 
by early november only three new buildings had been completed 
all by the army for the army 
karlin ambartsumyan chairman of the city communist party 
committee still hopes to move 4000 families into a vast new 
suburb before years end but even that would be only onefifth as 
many as planned 
for now ambartsumyan is concentrating on getting the remaining 
homeless among the 190000 people now living in leninakan into 
construction huts and other temporary housing and getting heat for 
them before winter 
svetlana asaturyan lives in one such hut generously called a 
little house in russian but in reality a tworoom insulated 
packing crate 
she and her family of five must haul water from a block away 
use nearby bushes as a toilet and travel to a relatives place for 
showers her washing flaps over a sea of mud 
mrs asaturyan is grateful however because they used to be in 
the remains of the towel factory where she once worked and where 
30 of her coworkers were killed 
her little house like thousands of others showed up 
without a door window glass heater wiring or furniture it was 
vandalized en route apparently by azerbaijanis whom the armenians 
accuse of stealing or destroying relief supplies 
when asked about the soviet leaderships promise to rebuild in 
two years mrs asaturyan said ill be glad if i get a home 
within five years 
about 20000 of the homeless are scheduled to receive apartments 
in the new suburb as sections are completed over 18 months a 
forest of 129 cranes towers over the site and buildings faced with 
local salmoncolored stone gleam in the sun 
because ninestory apartment blocks shoddily built of preformed 
concrete panels collapsed in the quake the new buildings are made 
by assembling vaultlike precast rooms foreman gennady pogosov 
said none is more than four stories high 
in may a commission of the ruling politburo blamed most of the 
deaths on shoddy construction and gave its findings to prosecutors 
no charges have been filed said haik minasyan an armenian 
government spokesman 
only a few projects are under way in the city itself on the 
central square a statue of vladimir i lenin looks over a scene of 
devastation a ruined school department store government 
building post office shops and a sock factory 
cafes and movie theaters are gone so are most food stores and 
shopping sometimes amounts to picking over piles of cabbages and 
potatoes at what remains of the bus station 
ambartsumyan said experts had ruled out reconstruction on half 
the original city lots because the ground is too unstable

his family hasnt seen araik sukasyan 
since the earthquake destroyed his school a year ago but they 
speak of him celebrating his 13th birthday soon and hope a moscow 
psychic can tell them where 
we wait to find him alive said his mother galine weeping 
as she pulled out araiks school portrait she hopes publicity will 
bring word from someone who has taken him in if that happened 
the fourth grader vanished in the rubble of school no 9 along 
with more than 500 other people when the earthquake hit leninakan 
during school hours dec 7 1988 
authorities say it killed 25000 people but the armenian relief 
agency search says 20000 more still are missing including 2000 
children 
they are not counted on the list of the dead or on the list of 
those evacuated said ashot georgyan director of the search 
office in yerevan capital of soviet armenia he said he had no way 
of knowing how many of the 20000 were dead and how many were just 
separated from their families 
we are now continuing the search for children particularly 
orphans who were sent in groups to various points in the soviet 
union and are still there in sanatoriums and resorts georgyan 
said 
many parents like the sukasyans believe officials may have 
lost track of some evacuees 
larissa vagashakovna head of the moscow office of search said 
she had asked in vain for state television to show pictures of the 
missing children 
its impossible to forget the faces of these parents she 
said they havent found the corpse and they havent found the 
child where have they disappeared to 
araiks sister narina also was in school no 9 when it 
crumpled she escaped and when her mother came running from home 
narina cried momma i am alive but i cant find my brother 
for a month after the earthquake the sukasyan family watched 
workers claw through the concrete and dust that had been school no 
9 
searchers found the bodies or identifiable parts of bodies of 
420 students and 26 teachers there was no sign of 100 others 
including araik 
there were people where they found only one leg and 
identified the shoe or the skirt and they buried that said lida 
grigoryan a teacher at another school and a friend of the family 
the sukasyans searched hospitals opened every one of thousands 
of coffins at the cemetery and telephoned relief agencies in 
yerevan and moscow 
they found no sign of their son and cling to the hope that 
someone took him away 
in moscow there is a woman who can see where someone is by 
looking at his picture we hope she can help araiks mother 
said then she was worried again because reports say the psychics 
powers only work with an original photograph 
this is a copy she said staring at her sons young 
serious face

how do hardworking mature university of 
cincinnati law students relax after a hard day of studying for 
final exams 
the favorite is playdoh law library secretary carol moore 
said monday we go through a lot of playdoh they say its 
really relaxing 
the colorful modeling clay is in the law librarys toy room an 
area stocked with marbles puzzles board games and far side 
cartoon books as well as coffee and food 
it began three years ago and reopened wednesday in the 
librarys urban morgan human rights room for the schools 2week 
final examination period 
its just really to relieve tension and stress ms moore 
said its a chance to do something besides study and hit the law 
books 
playing battleship or marbles in the toy room was often the only 
relief for students who studied as much as 20 hours a day for final 
exams said kim holling who graduated from the law school last 
year 
after you study all day theres just a point where you cant 
study any more and cant absorb any more she said this sounds 
pretty childish but we did those things 
the toy room was the idea of law librarian taylor fitchett who 
started similar toy rooms at the university of alabama and tulane 
university ms moore said 
she said to me the second year she was here i think we 
should have a play room for the students and i said just what 
am i supposed to do ms moore said she said we should get 
some puzzles and coloring books and i said are you serious 
ms fitchett was out of town monday and unavailable for comment 
ms moore said the library hasnt heard any complaints about the 
toy room 
but she said one problem can be how the playdoh is used she 
said the colorful modeling clay was used after the cincinnati 
bengals victory over the cleveland browns on sunday to modify a 
statue of president william h taft a graduate of the school 
i came into the library this morning and he had on a bengals 
helmet and i said oh no she said 
ms moore said the library plans to keep the toy room open only 
during test periods despite students pleas 
theyd like us to have it all year long but its too much of 
a mess she said

its the laugh that obnoxious giggle 
that ends in a fullfledged snort thats the mark of true nerd 
jeremy kahn has it naturally he is the founder president and 
ideological spokesman for the newly formed society of nerds and 
geeks or song at harvard university 
if veritas truth is the motto of harvard and vanitas 
is the motto of the harvard lampoon then the slogan of song is 
veritas is more important than vanitas explained kahn 20 a 
junior majoring in math 
the kind of people were looking for are very interested in 
what theyre studying not as worried about like what other 
people think about them said kahn who punctuates his sentences 
with like a lot 
truth is more important than to look good he added 
everyone knows or has known a nerd or a geek a nerd was that 
brainy math major in college the one with the thick glasses the 
perpetual pocket calculator and plaid shirt the geek is the guy 
or gal who wore mismatched socks or strange color combinations 
and walked to the beat of a drummer no one else heard 
nerds however go on to invent amazing new machines and make 
millions on the patents geeks go on to found new companies and 
become the ceo featured on fortunes cover for maverick style 
nerds and geeks always have the last laugh 
will nerds inherit the earth no but they might just save it 
according to kahn 
the first step he says is to help take the stigma off students 
who live to study not party song organized in midoctober by 
kahn aims to do that with meetings speakers and other activities 
basically its putting academics ahead of social life 
with about 35 members song meets weekly and fosters discussions 
on how to study better and improve academic standings 
we talk about like why grades are important to us or how 
we see relationships which may seem strange for nerds and geeks to 
talk about said kahn and he laughed that nerdy laugh 
future plans for song include lectures offbeat dances for 
those slightly out of step and a special procrastination hot 
line this would involve a kind caring and generous 
counselor to talk with students who simply cant get down to work 
i think students procrastinate more than anyone else its 
amazing how much time i spend procrastinating kahn said a hot 
line could get students on the road to recovery in 10 minutes 
theyd be sitting down and getting to work 
kahn had been thinking about organizing some kind of club since 
he entered harvard freshman year i found myself very isolated 
for the first time in my life i could not concentrate on studies 
no organization that would like help me concentrate on studies 
so he thought up the name society of nerds and geeks registered 
it with the proper harvard authorities and began having meetings 
most members are math majors but other disciplines are represented 
as well such as sanskrit 
the clubs graduate student adviser leonid fridman has written a 
nerd manifesto about the dangers of antiintellectualism yet 
the alumni adviser is the assistant coach of the harvard wrestling 
team demonstrating that nerds and jocks arent necessarily 
mutually exclusive 
the role of women in song isnt any different from that of 
men we are equal opportunity nerds said freshman kate tulenko 
an 18yearold biochemistry major 
theres a funny saying going around harvard blessed are the 
nerds and geeks for they will become trendsetters kahn said and 
then he laughed like nerd

a showdown between three 
pentecostal ministers and a prosecutor over the confidentiality of 
a burglary suspects confession in church ended when the man 
pleaded guilty to grand larceny 
larry yost who was to have gone on trial today entered the 
plea monday under an agreement reached at a hearing before morgan 
county circuit judge thomas steptoe yost 35 had been charged 
with the more serious crime of breaking and entering 
its over with said a jubilant rev shirley hiles we 
dont have to testify nor do we have to refuse to testify 
yosts hearing came after steptoe refused for the second time to 
excuse mrs hiles 51 her husband the rev jack hiles the 
58yearold founder and pastor of the word of deliverance 
association and the rev wilda maconaughey from subpoenas issued 
by county prosecutor charles trump iv 
yost a berkeley springs carpenter who has been held at the 
eastern regional jail in lieu of 15000 bond since january was 
sentenced to a year in the county jail with credit for time served 
im happy the whole church is happy yost said in a 
telephone interview from jail i didnt want to see the ministers 
go to jail and i should be out in a month if everything goes 
right 
last december a sobbing yost interrupted a service at the 
church confessing that he didnt try to stop the breakin at his 
uncles building supply store 
the ministers had said trump wanted them to testify at yosts 
trial and maintained authorities had crossed the boundary between 
gods work and their own 
steptoe first refused to block the subpoenas nov 15 ruling 
that state law does not protect confessions made to clergy the 
state supreme court last week refused to hear the ministers 
challenge 
west virginia and new hampshire are the only states that do not 
protect confessions made to ministers or priests in criminal cases 
said richard gay the ministers lawyer west virginia however 
does allow statements made to clergy about divorce proceedings to 
be kept secret gay said 
yost said earlier that just before christmas he told the 
congregation that he watched and did nothing as another man broke 
into his uncles store last december he denied having a role in 
the robbery 
it was such a burden on my heart i just had to go to my 
church and get it off my chest yost said 
gay said another attorney has contacted him about drafting 
legislation to protect clergy and penitents in similar situations 
i was disappointed the supreme court didnt take this 
opportunity to examine the issue he said its a fundamental 
issue that cries out to be heard 
the us constitution provides for freedom of religion gay also 
argued that the state constitution prohibits anyone from being 
subpoenaed jailed or arrested based upon a religious belief 
the importance of protecting confessions made to clergy has been 
recognized since the days of the roman empire according to the 
rev james burtchaell a roman catholic professor of theology at 
the university of notre dame 
society has said that it is of paramount importance that 
people be able to confide in clergymen or attorneys or their 
doctors without fear of it being disclosed said burtchaell who 
has taught a course preparing seminarians to hear confessions 
however burtchaell added that the ministers case may have been 
weakened because yost gave his confession publicly 
public confession of sins is a basic tenet of the pentacostal 
church jesus never took anyone aside and had them confess their 
sins in private mrs hiles said 
hiles said the churchs jail ministry had been hurt since 
inmates heard of the subpoenas 
they dont know if they can trust us anymore hiles said 
theyre saying why should i tell you anything if i do they 
might force you to say it in court

house banking committee chairman henry b 
gonzalez having aired the collapse of lincoln savings and loan 
association is considering probing an even more politically touchy 
case linked to president bushs family 
among the institutions that could be spotlighted next by the 
committee are silverado savings and loan association of denver 
declared insolvent by regulators in december 1988 
neil bush the presidents son served on silverados board of 
directors resigning just after his father won the republican 
nomination in 1988 and only four months before the sampls seizure 
in a drive to oust top thrift regulator m danny wall gonzalez 
conducted six public hearings this fall focusing on regulators 
delay in acting against the irvine califbased lincoln which is 
expected to become the nations largest sampl failure at a cost to 
taxpayers of 2 billion 
at the last hearing just before congress recessed for 
thanksgiving gonzalez dtexas vowed to continue the probe when 
legislators return in january expanding it to include other 
notorious examples of abuse 
we had scores of lincolns and were going to look into 
them lincoln is just the first because it was the biggest he 
said 
in response to a question from a reporter gonzalez said 
silverado could be among the failures highlighted at a future 
hearing committee aides have been gathering material on the case 
silverado was declared insolvent by thrift regulators on dec 9 
1988 and taxpayer costs could run as high as 500 million 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp now part of the 
federal deposit insurance corp attributed the failure to 
substantial dissipation of assets due to alleged violations of 
laws rules and regulations 
according to government sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity regulators are investigating to determine whether to 
file a civil suit against silverados former officers and 
directors which would include neil bush 
a new investigative book on the sampl crisis inside job by 
stephen pizzo mary fricker and paul muolo cites links between 
neil bush a director from 1985 until august 1988 and a major 
customer of silverado 
bushs oil and gas company jnb exploration had a 1 million 
line of credit at cherry creek national bank which was owned by 
bill walters who received more than 40 million in loans from 
silverado according to the book 
silverado also had business ties to larry mizel a prominent 
republican who raised 1 million for ronald reagans 1984 campaign 
james moroney a former analyst for the federal home loan bank 
of topeka alleges that regulators held off action against 
silverado because of its political connections the book says 
aides to gonzalez said no decision has been made about whether 
to air the silverado case in public hearings the lincoln sessions 
even though they targeted wall a republican proved more 
embarrassing for democrats because they highlighted the efforts of 
five senators four of them senior democrats to intervene with 
regulators on lincolns behalf 
the president thus far has praised gonzalez for his bipartisan 
conduct of the hearings and said he has not closed the door on 
ousting wall aides to wall speculate that gonzalez may be holding 
out the possibility of silverado hearings as part of his bid to get 
rid of the regulator

it isnt any noisy latenight parties at 
bachelor john shumates home that have his neighbors whispering 
its what he keeps in his front yard 
like the lifesize elvis presley bust with purple pompadour 
bolted atop a tall pedestal guarded by a grinning redbearded 
gnome holding a sign reading long live the king 
or that plastic palm tree festooned with blinking blue lights 
that decorated shumates front porch last christmas opposite a 
plastic santa claus whose fat belly was illuminated with a flashing 
light bulb 
passersby also are transfixed by the concrete venus de milo and 
pink flamingo the plastic madonna blessing the concrete rabbit 
squirrel and penguin 
and the little concrete toddler shyly clutching a teddy bear 
and sucking on its fingers while its diapers fall down its one of 
shumates favorites 
its the most horrifying thing ive ever seen he says with 
a chuckle its just awful 
shumate a 42yearold architect and avid collector of lawn 
ornaments delights in adorning the yard of his modest bungalow in 
this washington suburb with the sort of truly tasteless schlock 
that makes urban sophisticates wince 
i saw this stuff when i was a kid growing up in the 
philadelphia suburbs he said it was humorous to me even then 
whats interesting about the 50s was the junky stuff the cars 
the lawn sculptures the furniture its so bad its good 
shumate had only a few pink flamingos when he bought his 
arlington house three years ago perhaps it was the house with its 
original pink aluminum siding from the 1950s that inspired shumate 
to begin collecting in earnest 
his favorite haunt is harpers lawn ornaments a twoacre mecca 
for kitsch hunters in rural harrisonburg va it was there that he 
found his 32 elvis bust among the tons of concrete birdbaths 
jesus figures antlered stags and naked ladies 
things were relatively quiet around here until i put up 
elvis shumate said it became a landmark overnight at first 
my neighbors didnt know what to think but they finally figured 
out my sense of humor and now they enjoy it 
shumate is a cadillac freak too hes owned six of them the 
latest parked in his driveway is a monstrous 1975 model 
fleetwood original avocado green paint wide white sidewalls 
license plates that read gross xs for gross excess and a 
caution i brake for elvis bumper sticker 
i consider that to be one of my lawn sculptures he says 
down in his basement shumate keeps the trashy stuff he hasnt 
decided where to display in the proper mockserious style 
including a concrete cherub with a large fish draped over its 
shoulder and your generic babe with a bunch of grapes sprayed 
with gilt paint 
on a shelf are airbrushed wall squirrels a pink coffee mug 
with pelicanshaped handle a blue plastic shark that shumate once 
hung from the rearview mirror of his old powderblue caddy 
this is what yuppies put in their kitchen window as a joke 
he said disdainfully they have no real commitment to lawn 
ornaments if everyone thinks its a joke it doesnt count its 
not really fun

president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev left their weatherblown summit talks offering 
visions of a dawning era of lasting peace with the remnants of the 
cold war giving way to a better world 
they announced no breakthroughs sunday on issues that divide 
their countries such as central america and naval disarmament but 
said that was not the point of their openagenda dockside 
encounters 
in their parting remarks both chose to emphasize mutual 
aspirations 
we sought the answer to the question where we stand now 
gorbachev told reporters many things that were characteristic of 
the cold war should be abandoned the arms race mistrust 
psychological and ideological struggle and all that all that 
should be things of the past 
trading relaxed banter at the firstever joint news conference 
of soviet and us presidents bush and gorbachev repeatedly echoed 
each others words as they described their talks and their hopes 
for the future 
i couldnt have asked for a better result out of this 
nonsummit summit bush said it was a noagenda meeting and 
yet it was a meeting where were discussed as the chairman said 
many many subjects so i think if a meeting can improve relations 
i think this one has 
the next chance comes in june when a fullscale bushgorbachev 
summit is scheduled for washington 
the fireworks missing in the superpower talks were supplied 
sunday night in a loud and colorful display over the grand harbor 
of valletta the capital of this mediterranean island nation 
gorbachev meanwhile headed for moscow to meet with his warsaw 
pact allies while bush traveled to brussels to brief the nato 
allies 
tonight we stand at the crossroads of history on our way to a 
europe made whole and free bush said when he arrived in 
brussels today as the sun broke through the clouds there at 
malta we could see both a new world taking shape a new world of 
freedom he said 
gorbachev said he was encouraged and inspired by the reforms 
sweeping stalinstyle communism from eastern europe he said the 
changes stem from the desire of these peoples to ennoble their 
societies to make them more democratic humanitarian to open up 
the rest of the world 
and in a postsummit interview broadcast on soviet television 
he had praise for bush 
i must say im glad i found a lot of realism in bushs 
attitude and i felt his desire his effort to understand the 
processes under way exchange opinions to work out approaches 
gorbachev said the dialogue actually surpassed my expectations 
the weather in malta was less congenial what was planned as an 
offshore summit alternating between us and soviet warships never 
came off 
saturday afternoons session was canceled when bush could not 
get off the guidedmissile cruiser uss belknap because of 60 mph 
winds and high seas 
the two rounds of talks that did take place were both moved to 
the soviet cruise liner maxim gorky docked at marsaxlokk bay 
several hundred yards from the naval vessels neither leader ever 
made it to the missile cruiser slava intended to be the soviet 
summit site 
gorbachev suggested cutting naval forces on the two sides but 
bush whose largeship navy predominates said he was disinclined 
to think that this is an area where we will have immediate 
progress 
the leaders also restated their positions on central america 
bush complained about nicaraguan and cuban supplies of sovietbloc 
weapons to rebels fighting the rightwing government in el 
salvador while gorbachev said the sandinista government in 
nicaragua had given assurances such shipments had stopped 
i dont believe that the sandinistas have told the truth to 
our soviet friends bush said 
us officials said moscow could benefit from cuts in tariffs on 
soviet exports to the united states and american support for its 
participation in the 97nation general agreement on tariffs and 
trade in exchange for relaxing emigration restrictions on soviet 
jews 
the leaders also ordered their officials to speed up 
negotiations on treaties to cut conventional arms in europe and 
longrange nuclear weapons in hopes of signing both next year 
an unprecedented joint news conference at the conclusion of the 
summit was not part of the initial plans it developed when both 
leaders stayed to respond to questions after making their 
statements and unfolded in a relaxed almost teasing atmosphere 
while the two were discussing the possible reunification of 
germany gorbachev said he and bush had exchanged messages on the 
question 
the president wrote in english and i dont read english i 
answered him in russian and he doesnt read russian but we 
agreed said gorbachev 
no matter what it said bush added

soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev sets out from his first superpower summit meeting with 
president bush to lead his warsaw pact alliance into a new era of 
cooperation with the west or risk being left behind and alone 
as he and bush parted after two days in the mediterranean 
gorbachev headed home for a meeting with a dramatically different 
and more westwardlooking warsaw pact leadership than when members 
last convened in july 
the communist bloc alliance has become less communist and less a 
bloc presenting gorbachev with the challenge of leading the 
transition he described from a kremlindominated military alliance 
to a new political association guiding east europe in its rush to 
erase the lines that have divided east and west for 45 years 
culturally and geographically moscows warsaw pact partners are 
closer to the west than the vast soviet union straddling europe and 
asia and as they turn away from the kremlin to face the west 
gorbachev may find it increasingly difficult to drive his 
stubbornly backward society at a quick enough pace to catch up 
at his joint news conference with bush closing their first 
summit meeting gorbachev declared himself encouraged and 
inspired by the changes that have swept hardline communists from 
power in poland east germany czechoslovakia and bulgaria 
the changes he said show the desire of these peoples to 
ennoble their societies to make them more democratic and 
humanitarian and to open up to the rest of the world 
but they also dramatically alter the kremlins once dominant and 
domineering role in the alliance 
for the first time since the pact was signed in the polish 
capital in 1955 in response to the formation of the north atlantic 
treaty alliance one of the leaders present polish prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki will be a noncommunist 
mazowiecki a leader of the independent solidarity labor 
movement suppressed with soviet support in 1981 was elected in 
august to head east europes first noncommunist government in four 
decades 
and on the eve of the summit the leadership of east germany at 
the heart of the strategic alliance was wrenched by its second 
spasm in recent weeks as communist leader egon krenz and the 
partys entire top echelon abdicated to a 25member panel of 
reformers in a desperate effort to salvage some measure of support 
for the communist party 
krenz relinquished the party post he had held less than six 
weeks and although he retained the largely ceremonial title of 
president it was not immediately clear who would represent east 
germany at the moscow meeting 
several other east european leaders including petar mladenov of 
bulgaria and karel urbanek of czechoslovakia are attending their 
first warsaw pact leadership meeting 
and for the first time since the alliance was formed the head 
of the polish communist party now out of power apparently wasnt 
invited at all 
nicolae ceausescu who continues to rule romania with the iron 
hand once rewarded by moscow is the only east bloc leader who 
rejects the democratically inspired reform movement with the 
recent fall of orthodox communist leaders like erich honecker in 
east germany and milos jakes in czechoslovakia he is likely to 
find himself more isolated than ever as he sits down with the new 
generation of east european leaders

before the dockside summit this tiny 
island nation suffered from an identity crisis maltese passports 
even included a map to show doubtful foreigners that the country 
exists 
but that was before president bush and soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev came to malta and put this rocky mediterranean 
archipelago back on everyones map 
the passports will be changed shortly after the first of the 
year said a slightly embarrassed richard cachia caruana the aide 
to the prime minister who was in charge of organizing maltas part 
in the summit 
that was a lack of selfconfidence by the previous 
government he said shaking his head its degrading 
any lingering doubts by the maltese about their countrys 
identity seemed to have been dispelled by the superpower summit by 
the words and images beamed abroad by about 2500 journalists 
covering the george bushmikhail gorbachev talks 
for malta itself the summit has been very positive it has 
shown malta can cope even with the necessary organization for a 
summit like this prime minister edward fenech adami said in an 
interview after the summit closed sunday 
some people were skeptical that malta could do it i think we 
proved ourselves he added 
not even the fierce december gale that drove the summit at sea 
to the side of a pier could dampen the enthusiasm of the prime 
minister 
well i dont mind the weather at all if anything it has 
proved i was correct when i suggested that the meetings should not 
be held in marsaxlokk but in some other bay such as grand harbor 
which is more protected than marsaxlokk bay he said 
cachia caruana said the soviets and americans first planned to 
hold the summit at sea perhaps in maltese territorial waters but 
that the prime minister had convinced them of the hazards of 
december 
within 24 hours we made the point that this is december and 
that these things can happen he said 
still he acknowledges the images of thunderous waves crashing 
against the rocks below the 16th century fortifications of the 
capital valletta wont help the islands winter tourism 
in terms of what we had hoped to achieve overall the tourism 
objectives probably will not be met said cachia caruana but 
our principal objective especially in the united states was name 
identification 
just being at the center of the world stage for two days in a 
way helped give us that anyway 
cachia caruana said malta wants to base its growth on business 
not just tourism and thats why the summit will help 
our greatest objective is dragging the economy into the last 
decade of the 20th century he said 
still in those first few hours after the departure of the 
leaders of the united states and the soviet union the chief 
maltese organizer of the summit was relieved that it was over 
its been a hell of an experience we had a situation here 
where the journalists outnumbered the army by twotoone said 
cachia caruana 
its back to business as usual tomorrow we will assume it was 
a dream and forget all about it

recent japanese purchases in manhattan have made 
some people nervous despite a foreignbuyer tradition that started 
when dutch settlers snapped up the island for 24 worth of knives 
fabric and trinkets 
officials say a majority of manhattans buildings still are 
owned by americans and japanese are not even the largest foreign 
landlords some find the alarm over japanese purchases puzzling 
i dont know whats behind this xenophobia said rosemary 
scanlon an economist for the port authority of new york and new 
jersey everyone seems to have been jolted awake to find were 
not the only large economy in the world 
several organizations have tried to estimate foreign holdings in 
manhattan commercial real estate but no one really knows the 
figure said edward s gordon head of the real estate firm that 
bears his name 
when a foreigner buys a piece of property he doesnt declare 
im a foreigner said marie hill a researcher for the real 
estate board of new york the owners name may be piccadilly 
properties but theres no legislation requiring them to sign in as 
british 
foreign investments often are made through part ownerships 
joint ventures and convertible mortgages which can further cloud 
an owners identity on a mortgage the address might simply say 
return to curacao said ms hill 
when mitsubishi estate co announced in october it was spending 
846 million for a controlling interest in the company that owns 
rockefeller center local wits said sumo wrestlers would soon take 
over the centers ice skating rink 
on a more gloomy note sen joseph lieberman dconn said of 
the christmas treelighting ceremony at the center in midtown 
manhattan that great national celebration is actually occurring 
on japanese property 
but noted ms hill the british and the dutch have been 
buying in this country for a long long time and it seems safe 
to say that worries about foreigners buying up manhattan are 
exaggerated 
for all the publicity the amount of foreignowned real estate 
here is still pretty modest said scanlon its not such a big 
deal 
according to the port authority during the past 15 years 
foreigners have acquired about 64 million of manhattans 335 
million square feet of prime office space or 19 percent this 
includes canadians 73 percent japanese 54 percent british 
27 percent and dutch 14 percent other foreigners have bought 
more than 2 percent 
the citys largest single foreign landowner is olympia amp york of 
toronto which shrewdly began buying in the depressed market of the 
mid1970s and now owns about 25 million square feet of office space 
worth billion of dollars 
since 1986 japanese investors have jumped into commercial real 
estate snapping up the exxon citicorp mobil abc and paine 
webber buildings they also bought hotels including the algonquin 
the stanhope the intercontinental and the essex house 
but they have been even more active elsewhere in 1988 when 
japanese investors bought 83 billion in us real estate twice 
as much of that was in california as in new york state 
more than half the office buildings in downtown los angeles are 
foreign owned according to the real estate firm of cushman amp 
wakefield even in atlanta a city that was never a magnet for 
foreign investment 12 percent of the office space is owned by 
foreigners and some experts say that could rise to 50 percent by 
the year 2000 
foreign investment in manhattan office space will surely 
increase swedes and koreans are said to be next in line for some 
prime buildings but business executives at least arent worried 
in a survey released earlier this year 55 percent of corporate 
executives said foreign investment helped the us economy and 31 
percent said it was little cause for alarm 
only 10 percent of real estate executives said foreign 
investment severely threatened the us economy 
in fact foreign investment is crucial to new york said ms 
scanlon noting that foreign money helped the city rebound from its 
fiscal crisis a decade ago 
its important for the citys economy that investment come 
in she said its not so important where it comes from

here is the text of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs statement sunday at the conclusion 
of his twoday summit meeting with president bush 
there are many symbolic things about this meeting and one of 
them it has never been in history that the leaders of our two 
countries hold a joint press conference this is also an important 
symbol 
i share the view voiced by president bush that we are satisfied 
in general with the results of the meeting we regard this informal 
meeting the idea of it was an informal meeting and the idea 
belongs to president bush and i supported it that we would have 
this informal meeting without restricting it to any formal agenda 
to have a free exchange of views because the time makes great 
demands to our countries and this increases the responsibility and 
the role of our two countries and i can assure you that in all our 
discussions and our discussions lasted for eight hours in 
general this responsibility on both sides was present 
our meeting was characterized by openness by a full scope of 
the exchange of views today it is even difficult and perhaps 
there is no sense to explain the entire range of issues that we 
have discussed i wish to say right away nevertheless that on all 
the major issues we attempted in a frank manner using each sides 
arguments to explain our own positions both with regard to the 
assessment of the situation and the current changes in the world 
in europe and as regards disarmament issues we addressed the 
geneva negotiating process the vienna process and also 
negotiations on the elaboration of the chemical weapons ban all 
those questions were considered thoroughly 
the president and i myself also thought it necessary to 
exchange views on our perception both from moscow and washington 
of the hot places on our planet and this exchange of views was 
very significant and thorough we reaffirmed our former positions 
that all those issues acute issues must be resolved by political 
methods and i consider that this was a very important statement of 
fact 
we not only discussed problems and explained our positions i 
think that both sides had many elements which if they are taken 
into account in our future activities activities of both 
governments then we can count on progress this concerns the 
subject of the reduction of strategic offensive arms by 50 percent 
and we have an optimistic assessment of the possibility to move 
even next year to the conclusion of the vienna treaty we both are 
in favor and this is our position naturally we can be 
responsible only for our position we are in favor of signing this 
document at the summit meeting 
this time we discussed much bilateral relations and i on my 
part would like to note many positive elements and points which 
were contained in statements and words by president bush thus i 
would say that in all directions of the political dialogue of our 
discussion including bilateral relations we not only confirmed 
the consistency of our political course the continuity of our 
political course and i should say although we had an informal 
meeting we met only for the first time with president bush in his 
capacity and the confirmation of the continuity of the course is 
an important element 
what is also important is that during this informal meeting we 
have laid the foundation for increasing this and i believe that in 
the first place it serves the interest of our both countries and 
also the interests of the entire world community well we have 
made our contact a good contact the atmosphere was friendly 
straightforward open and this enabled us to make good work in 
our position the most dangerous thing is to exaggerate and that 
is always that we should preserve elements of cautiousness and i 
use the favorite word by president bush laughter 
our world and our relations are at a crucial juncture we should 
be highly responsible to face up to the challenges of todays 
world and the leaders of our two countries cannot act as a fire 
brigade although fire brigades are very useful we have to keep it 
in mind also this element was also present 
i would like once again to thank the president for the idea of 
holding this meeting with which we are satisfied i hope and i 
would like to thank the people and the government of malta and to 
express the words of appreciation and gratitude for their 
hospitality thank you mr president for your cooperation

here is the text of president 
bushs statement at the conclusion of his twoday summit meeting 
with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
ladies and gentlemen president gorbachev has graciously 
suggested i go first and i dont think anyone can say that the 
saltwater gettogether was anything other than adventure at least 
out in the harbor here 
first i want to thank prime minister eddie fenech adami and 
the people of malta and others for their warm and gracious 
hospitality i want to thank the captain and crew of the uss 
belknap for the great support that theyve given us i think they 
were wondering if i was about to become a permanent guest and a 
special thanks to the captain and crew of the soviet cruise ship 
maxim gorky for their hospitality and also thanks to the captain 
and crew of the soviet naval cruiser slava who had been so 
hospitable to many on the american side 
i first approached chairman gorbachev about an informal meeting 
of this kind after my trip to europe last july the amazing changes 
that i witnessed in poland and in hungary hopeful changes led me 
to believe that it was time to sit down with chairman gorbachev 
face to face to see what he and i could do to seize the 
opportunities before us to move this relationship forward he 
agreed with that concept of a meeting and so we got rapid 
agreement 
and i think that the extraordinary developments in europe 
since the time that the meeting was proposed only reinforced the 
importance of our getting together so im especially glad we had 
this meeting and we did gain a deeper understanding of each 
others views we set the stage for progress across a broad range 
of issues 
and while it is not for the united states and the soviet union 
to design the future for europeans or for any other people i am 
convinced that a cooperative ussoviet relationship can indeed 
make the future safer and brighter 
and there is virtually no problem in the world and certainly no 
problem in europe that improvement in the ussoviet relationship 
will not help to ameliorate a better ussoviet relationship is 
to be valued in and of itself but it also should be an instrument 
of positive change for the world 
for 40 years the western alliances stood together in the cause 
of freedom and now with reform under way in the soviet union we 
stand at the threshold of a brandnew era of ussoviet relations 
and it is within our grasp to contribute each in our own way 
to overcoming the division of europe and ending the military 
confrontation there weve got to do more to ameliorate the 
violence and suffering that afflict so many regions in the world 
and to remove common threats to our future 
the deterioration of the environment the spread of nuclear and 
chemical weapons ballistic missile technology the narcotics 
trade and our discussions here will give greater impetus to make 
real progress in these areas 
theres also a great potential to develop common opportunities 
for example the soviet union now seeks greater engagement with 
the international market economy a step that certainly im 
prepared to encourage in every way i can 
as i leave malta for brussels and a meeting with our nato 
allies i am optimistic that as the west works patiently together 
and increasingly cooperates with the soviet union we can realize a 
lasting peace and transform the eastwest relationship to one of 
enduring cooperation and that is a future that is worthy of our 
peoples and thats the future that i want to help in creating and 
thats the future that chairman gorbachev and i began right here in 
malta 
to gorbachev thank you sir for your hospitality

catfish farming has had some flipflops over 
the years but agriculture department experts say it looks good over 
the long pull 
for that matter fish farming in general aquaculture is the 
fancy name is expanding and shows promise if growers and 
processors can hone their marketing skills 
catfish are the main items in us aquaculture output but 
trout salmon crawfish and other species are also growing 
according to david j harvey of the departments economic research 
service 
but there are problems for example catfish farmers have 
boosted production so rapidly that sometimes the demand lags 
supplies in october for example production was estimated at 317 
million pounds live weight that was up 21 percent from 262 
million pounds a year earlier 
prices received by growers averaged 64 cents per pound down 19 
percent from 79 cents in october 1988 
harvey said aquaculture in the united states is still a young 
and growing industry that is still going through adjustments that 
may become even more important in the 1990s 
a number of forces will contribute to the continued growth of 
us aquaculture harvey told last weeks usda outlook conference 
first the interaction of worldwide population growth and the 
biological limits of what our oceans can supply should increase the 
demand for farmraised fish he said as the capturefisheries 
industry approaches maximum harvest rates for more and more 
species added pressure will be placed on aquaculture to become a 
major source of seafood production 
harvey said one sign of the pressure on commercial fishing the 
capture fisheries is the growing number of harvesting 
restrictions being placed on species around the world 
another factor is the growing public concern about pollution of 
ocean and fresh water resources this should strengthen 
aquacultures position as an alternate source of seafood produced 
under closely watched conditions he said 
however aquaculturists must make the public aware of how 
their products differ from those of the capturefisheries 
industry harvey said to avoid consumer resistance to their 
products due to pollution concerns producers must maintain high 
quality standards be sensitive to consumer fears about 
contaminated products and be able to document the safety of their 
products 
the ongoing emphasis on nutrition also should help boost seafood 
consumption he said 
other factors that may influence us seafood consumption 
include the general aging of americans and the rising percentage of 
nonwhites 
both these groups older people and nonwhites in the past 
have consumed seafood at higher rates than the general 
population harvey said one usda study combining changes in 
age race and income estimated that seafood expenditures for fish 
products would increase 274 percent between 1980 and 2005 well 
above the projected increases for beef pork or poultry 
harvey said if legislation is passed to require federal 
inspection of seafood products it would boost consumer confidence 
in the safety of us seafood but would probably add some expense 
to processing and marketing 
the basic technologies are now in place for the expansion of 
the domestic aquaculture industry but producers will have to 
successfully deal with a variety of issues that may impact future 
growth he said the rate of growth for most aquacultural 
species may depend on the industrys success at marketing its 
products to a larger group of consumers

weary network crews trudged home today after 
following their anchormen from czechoslovakia to rome to malta 
where they covered a summit whose storms threatened to upstage the 
superpowers 
at one point saturday night cbs anchor dan rather warned that 
if the weather doesnt improve this things going to be a 
wreck 
but from the tv standpoint the only thing wrecked at the summit 
was a small studio cnn had built near marsaxlokk bay overlooking 
the harbor site of the shipboard meetings of president bush and 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
a cnn spokesman said the structure was demolished by saturdays 
storm which forced the cancellation of the days second planned 
meeting of the two leaders and sent network staffs scurrying to 
reshape their coverage 
cnn anchor bernard shaw had to remain with the other anchors in 
the city of valetta six miles away but that was only one of cnns 
problems 
saturdays 60 mph winds blew down and damaged a cnn satellite 
dish knocking out cnns signal for eight hours but a spokesman 
said no transmissions had been planned during the period of the 
blackout which began at 9 pm est 
the storm also briefly affected abc rain shorted out an 
electrical connection at the start of anchor peter jennings live 
summit report from malta during the first of two world news 
tonight broadcasts that abc sends its affiliates each night 
but the maltese connection was quickly restored jennings came 
back on with his report eight minutes later 
the storm didnt much affect cbs and nbc coverage of saturdays 
summit to which the four us networks brought a total of nearly 
200 staff members 
on sunday the weather was much better but an electronic 
problem caused a translation problem for nbc and cnn during the 
live telecast of the superpower leaders joint news conference 
aboard the safely docked soviet luxury liner maxim gorky 
the soviets provided the tv pool feed for broadcasters and an 
audio channel offering a simultaneous english translations of 
gorbachevs remarks 
however during the last half hour of the session an electronic 
glitch knocked out the englishlanguage channel cbs and abc had 
translators standing by so viewers didnt miss anything 
nbc hastily summoned a soviet official on malta but missed 
eight minutes of translation 
cnn went the long way for help after 13 minutes in which shaw 
recapped summit news while gorbachev was speaking an american 
womans voice was heard translating the soviet leaders comments 
she was siobahn darrow translating from cnn headquarters in 
atlanta a cnn spokeswoman said 
the summit capped a busy week for the networks during which 
their anchors were based in prague rome and in the case of abc 
west germany

during frequent visits to nancy 
cruzans hospital bedside her father patiently recites the 
braindamaged womans legal situation she cant reply but joe 
cruzan says he knows her wishes 
he says the nancy he knew lover of laughter and life would 
rather die than linger in her persistent vegetative state 
incapable of interacting with her environment and possessing no 
thoughts no emotions 
i dont think this is a decision for every family but it is 
the right decision for us because we feel that is what nancy would 
want said the 55yearold sheet metal worker 
nancy cruzan 32 a former employee of a cheese factory has 
been in this condition since a 1983 car wreck kept alive with a 
feeding tube surgically implanted in her stomach she stays at 
taxpayer expense at the missouri rehabilitation center a state 
institution in mount vernon 
on wednesday her parents will be in the us supreme court 
listening again to the legal questions father shares with daughter 
in the quiet of her hospital room 
ive told her what the legal process is cruzan said ive 
said nancy i know this is scary because i think everyone to a 
certain extent fears death its an unknown thing 
the case marks the first time the court has considered when it 
is appropriate to stop medical treatment to pull the plug on a 
life 
cruzan and his wife joyce acting as nancys courtappointed 
guardians want to remove her feeding tube a missouri judge ruled 
they could but the state supreme court overturned that ruling in 
november 1988 
missouri law allows people under certain circumstances to refuse 
medical treatment but not food and water among the issues in the 
cruzan case is whether family members can make such a refusal on 
behalf of an incompetent relative and whether food and water 
provided through a surgically implanted tube constitutes medical 
treatment 
the parents say they should have the final word about whether 
their daughter lives or dies they also say the state has no right 
to force unwanted treatment on nancy and that she has not lost her 
constitutional rights including the right to privacy because of 
her condition 
missouri attorney general william webster counters that the 
state supreme court was correct in saying the parents cannot 
terminate the use of the feeding tube 
its a question of whether the court will articulate a new 
constitutional right for the family he said we dont think 
the remedy the family is seeking is found in the united states 
constitution 
the most famous righttodie case was never taken up by the 
nations high court in 1976 the new jersey supreme court ruled 
that joseph and julie quinlan had a right to take their comatose 
daughter karen ann off a respirator and the federal justices 
declined to review the decision ms quinlans respirator was 
removed but she continued to be fed through a tube she lingered 
nine years before dying in 1985 at age 31 
as the cruzan case goes to washington nancy lies in a bed her 
body stiff and her hands so bent they resemble claws the 
fingernails digging into her wrists if they go untrimmed 
doctors say nancy could live 40 more years if she is given food 
and water cruzan says nancy wouldnt like that prospect he hopes 
the justices will agree 
i feel like if they make a common sense judgment they will 
rule in our favor he said from his home in carterville in 
southwestern missouri i do feel optimistic 
its something that has to be done something to achieve the 
goal we have set out to achieve he said 
the cruzans attorney bill colby also expects to prevail 
this is hopefully the end of a long long road but the family 
has been willing to travel that road because they are doing what 
they know as only a family can know that nancy would want it has 
been an agonizing ordeal

the federal prison system is 56 percent over 
capacity with more than twice as many inmates as in 1980 when the 
system was less than 1 percent above capacity a congressional 
report says 
federal prisons contained 24162 inmates in 1980 but the number 
mushroomed to 48017 by 1989 said the report sunday by the general 
accounting office congress investigative arm 
the 70 institutions operated by the federal system were designed 
to hold a maximum of 30860 prisoners 
the report was requested by rep charles rangel dny and 
sen sam nunn dga 
even under a federal bureau of prisons plan to increase capacity 
by 109 percent to 64400 inmates within the next five years the 
system is still projected to be operating at 30 percent over 
capacity the report said 
and authorities are projecting an inmate population of up to 
147000 in the federal system within a dozen years the report said 
it also contained these other findings 
just 19 percent of prisoners counted in may 1989 were serving 
time for violent offenses 
the price tag for expanding the prison system is 51340 a bed 
forty percent of inmates entering the system had a moderate or 
serious substance abuse problem 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids represents a 
potentially serious and costly problem for the prison system 
the report also said state prison systems are operating at 23 
percent over capacity with a total of 577000 inmates it said that 
as of april 35 states and the district of columbia were operating 
under court orders or consent decrees related to crowding 
rangel chairman of the house select committee on narcotics 
said in a statement that until we get at the root causes of drug 
abuse homelessness joblessness lack of education lack of 
health care and above all poverty we are likely to see continued 
record overcrowding no matter how many prisons we build 
he said it is clear that most criminals are not being 
rehabilitated by prison but instead are back behind bars within 
three to five years that is a very expensive process he said 
i recognize that it may not be politically popular but we 
have to provide alternative programs for nonviolent offenders with 
education rehabilitation job training and drug treatment to 
generate better citizens instead of more hardened criminals 
rangel said 
nunn said key reasons for the mushrooming prison population are 
mandatory sentencing and stricter parole practices 
because prison overcrowding is often a key factor in increased 
prison violence and disciplinary problems we must have a better 
handle on how to deal with the growing number of people entering 
the prison systems nunn said

north dakotans take a tradition of 
political orneriness to the polls tuesday in a special election 
that will decide seven referendums including higher taxes 
gambling and sex education 
the debate has focused on whether to sustain the legislatures 
decision to raise taxes on income sales and gasoline a move 
opponents contend will drive people and businesses out of a state 
already in an economic slump 
it also has pitted gambling opponents against the attorney 
general and the state health department against a parents group 
troubled by proposed mandatory health instruction in the public 
schools 
its certainly been a difficult campaign said gov george 
sinner who has held dozens of public forums urging voters to 
uphold the tax increases 
over the years north dakota voters have used referendums to 
block construction of a state office building reverse a college 
name change and sustain a ban on municipal parking meters 
however they havent had to vote on so many referendums at one 
time since june 1919 when voters approved seven bills said 
secretary of state jim kusler one established the bank of north 
dakota which remains the nations only stateowned bank 
sinner a democrat won his second term last year with 60 
percent of the vote against a republican candidate who pledged not 
to raise taxes 
this fall he threw himself into the lead role of campaigning 
for the tax bills that would raise the sales tax from 5 percent to 
6 percent the gasoline tax from 17 cents to 20 cents a gallon and 
the income tax from 14 percent to 17 percent of a taxpayers 
federal tax bill 
if i dont keep this state with a good future im going to 
consider my job and my work as a failure nothing else seems to me 
to be any more important than that and politics be damned 
sinner told reporters 
the governor has used the specter of increased property taxes 
and drastic cuts in education and social services if voters reject 
the tax measures last week in bismarck he appeared on stage with 
two men in wheelchairs who spoke about their fears of cuts in 
state humanservices spending 
kent french a bismarck businessman who has led the fight 
against the tax increases says the governor is exaggerating their 
possible impact 
its time for state government to make spending choices the 
same way families have had to do french said their choice has 
been to raise taxes and thats got to stop 
in addition to the three separate referendums on taxes voters 
must decide whether to approve the sex education issue a mandatory 
seatbelt law a retirement program for legislators and 
legalization of video gambling machines they also were considering 
a proposed constitutional amendment to reorganize state government 
attorney general nicholas spaeth is advocating the gambling 
machines as an honest alternative to pull tabs pullapart paper 
tickets that players draw at random from a jar in hopes of picking 
one carrying a cash prize 
but introduction of the machines is being fought by opponents of 
statesanctioned gambling including former gov arthur link and 
pull tab manufacturers who fear the machines will cut into their 
market 
it certainly hasnt been a political success for me to endorse 
the concept of electronic gaming but i think its the right thing 
for north dakota spaeth said last week 
debate over the health curriculum has centered on whether 
information about aids and other sexually transmitted diseases 
belongs in public schools the law under challenge in the 
referendum would mandate health education in every school 
including information about sexually transmitted diseases it 
leaves decisions on details largely to individual districts 
an opponent joanne bergstedt a registered nurse from the 
western north dakota community of hazen contends the teaching of 
sexual abstinence should take precedence over instruction on the 
use of contraceptives as a way of preventing disease 
the opponents are looking for bogymen under every stone 
countered dr stephen mcdonough an official of the state health 
department he said the education program will emphasize abstinence 
polls indicate voters are leaning in favor of the seat belt and 
health education laws but against electronic gambling and the 
legislative retirement program 
the polls initially showed overwhelming opposition to the tax 
increases but they have shifted in favor of tax advocates as the 
election nears and both sides predict a close result 
its going to go right down to the wire french said i 
just pray to god it doesnt snow on december fifth

serious security lapses involving large 
amounts of plutonium were noted in an inspection earlier this year 
of a federal nuclear weapons laboratory in california a 
congressional report says 
the report released sunday also said the energy department from 
1982 through 1988 misled the president in its annual reports to 
the white house about the adequacy of measures to protect 
weaponsgrade nuclear materials from potential theft or sabotage 
the report included a declassified transcript of a closed 
hearing last july in which several senior energy department 
officials testified on security and safeguards weaknesses in the 
nuclear weapons production and design complex the hearing was held 
by the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations 
the panel is investigating the departments nuclear weapons 
facilities which have been wracked by allegations of health 
safety and environmental violations some key plants have been 
closed temporarily 
according to the hearing transcript edward j mccallum 
director of the energy departments weapons security evaluations 
office was highly critical of nuclear materials protection at 
lawrence livermore national laboratory near livermore calif 
the livermore lab has come under fire in recent years for 
illegal drug use by some employees alleged ethics and 
conflictofinterest violations by senior lab officials and charges 
of theft of government property from the facility 
the lab is run for the government by the university of 
california 
one passage from the mccallum report said security systems at a 
livermore building in which weaponsgrade plutonium is handled do 
not provide assurance that the highly radioactive material is 
adequately protected from theft or sabotage 
also it said the security system was unreliable in detecting 
contraband at entry gates and intruders at specially protected 
areas with access to nuclear materials 
under questioning from rep gerry sikorski dminn mccallum 
said these security lapses involved quantities of plutonium greater 
than 45 pounds which is enough to build a nuclear bomb 
another part of mccallums report said the lab sometimes allowed 
category one quantities of plutonium to be left unattended in 
rooms without security alarms mccallum told sikorski this was a 
serious breach of security 
mccallums report was based on an inspection last april and may 
of livermore and the departments regional office in san francisco 
which oversees the labs operations 
among other disclosures in the subcommittee report 
among all the 26 weapons facilities and regional offices 
inspected for security and weapons materials protection safeguards 
by mccallums office over the past year livermore ranked the 
lowest 
the oak ridge tenn and las vegas nev regional offices 
used private contractors in some cases to screen and interview 
weapons plant employees seeking security clearances these 
contractors did not actually grant any clearances but their role 
nonetheless was contrary to department policy officials said 
the department acknowledged that it lacks the resources to 
complete investigations of suspected security violations by some 
weapons employees who currently have access to classified material 
this violates the departments own policy mccallum wrote in his 
report and does not provide assurance that only eligible 
individuals are granted continued access to security interests 
the hearing also disclosed that the san francisco regional 
office had chosen not to include the plutoniumhandling building in 
its own most recent inspections of livermore donald w pearman 
jr acting manager of the san francisco office told the panel 
that because of this omission he was not aware of the plutonium 
safeguards problems at the time of the mccallum inspection 
in a later written response to energy and commerce committee 
chairman john dingell dmich energy secretary james d watkins 
called the omission a serious oversight watkins also said the 
san francisco office had changed its inspection methods to include 
an intensive annual survey of all lab facilities 
in the subcommittee report released sunday dingell said annual 
reports to the president from the energy secretary had offered a 
misleading account of the level of protection being afforded 
special nuclear materials and nuclear facilities

a gallon of gasoline cost about a halfcent 
less at the nations pumps during the past two weeks due to the 
traditional fallwinter decrease in driving according to an 
industry analyst 
the average servicestation price of gasoline including taxes 
was 10697 per gallon as of dec 1 according to a trilby 
lundbergs biweekly survey of 13000 stations 
the previous retail average was 10751 per gallon 
this continues a downward price trend that has prevailed ever 
since late may except for two very small upward price moves ms 
lundberg said sunday she said the decline can be attributed to 
decreased driving that normally occurs at this time of year prices 
were cut to spur sales 
prices per gallon at selfservice pumps as of dec 1 were 9510 
cents for regular unleaded 11271 for premium unleaded and 9646

randall dale adams who was freed from prison 
after his case was documented in the movie the thin blue line 
said it felt strange to return to the city where he was convicted 
of killing a policeman 
adams first return to dallas since his release from state 
prison last march was because of a benefit dinner for an 
organization that investigates the cases of people who may have 
been wrongly convicted 
adams who now in columbus ohio spent 12 years behind bars for 
the 1976 shooting death of the policeman 
being back here is a little strange you can understand that 
the last time i was here i was pretty anxious to leave adams 
said saturday night at the dinner for justice denied research inc 
the thin blue line questioned the testimony of prosecution 
witnesses in the case a state appeals court later overturned the 
conviction and authorities chose not to seek a retrial 
adams was beginning a 12day tour of italy this week to 
correspond with the european premiere of the thin blue line and 
speak at an annual meeting of amnesty international 
adams accompanied by his mother mildred adams said he stopped 
in dallas to encourage the efforts of justice denied research 
which is led by jim humphreys 
humphreys obtained information that was instrumental in the 
release of lenell geter an engineer from south carolina who spent 
two years in texas prisons for a robbery before another suspect was 
identified

karen prince always planned to use her legal 
training to help the disabled but the deaf rutgers university law 
student found she also needed her skills to help herself 
ms prince a 39yearold thirdyear law student who represented 
herself in a court hearing won a court order forcing the 
university to supply her with class notes 
her victory was one of two last week that upheld rights of the 
disabled a federal judge ruled that a school district in white 
plains ny must supply a signlanguage interpreter for deaf 
parents at schoolsponsored parents conferences 
both lawsuits were filed under the federal rehabilitation act of 
1973 which says any organization receiving federal aid cannot 
discriminate against the handicapped 
we have two examples of recipients of federal financial 
assistance which refused to provide services of meaningful 
access to the programs said marc charmatz attorney for the 
national association for the deaf legal defense fund which brought 
the new york case in both cases the court recognized that the 
deaf parents or the deaf student were denied meaningful access 
the new york case is the first of its kind in the country 
according to charmatz coupled with the new jersey case it 
provides leverage to force school districts to comply with the 
federal guidelines he said 
this is an illustration of what school districts must do 
charmatz said 
ms prince said her case marks the first time federal civil 
rights provisions have been used to force a university to supply 
assistance for a deaf student 
when she began taking classes at the camden campus in 1986 she 
said the university agreed to provide notetakers and interpreters 
for every course 
since then ms prince has filed two civil rights claims 
contending the university failed to live up to its promise in one 
instance she rejected notes she said were illegible 
in the latest battle a judge ordered the school provide 
notetakers and issued a temporary restraining order barring 
rutgers from holding two classes unless ms prince received 
transcribed notes within 24 hours of each class 
audrey blackburn associate dean of student affairs said the 
university late last week hired a court stenographer to take notes 
for four onehour lecture sessions the service costs about 1400 
she said 
the university has spent about 10000 a year to provide 
signlanguage translators and notetakers for ms prince school 
officials said school spokesmen have said they have had trouble 
finding qualified candidates 
the law requires that one exert reasonable efforts and i 
believe i did above and beyond that blackburn said 
ms prince the only deaf student attending the 700student law 
school expects to graduate this semester which ends dec 22 
my first year i almost quit three times she recalled in an 
interview done with an interpreter and through ms princes 
lipreading ability it was so horrible i just stuck it out 
her determination earned her classmates admiration 
i have a great amount of respect for the fact that shes come 
to law school and overcome her handicap thats kind of 
impressive said ross gigliotti 24 a thirdyear student from 
cherry hill 
ms prince began losing her hearing during her last two years of 
undergraduate study at the university of delaware and became deaf 
in 1972 
she learned sign language at gallaudet college in washington 
dc and later worked as a legal secretary and researcher a 
strong interest in political science and tougher legislation to 
help the disabled spurred her interest in law school 
ms prince said she is considering setting up practices in 
several legal areas public interest civil rights or contract law 
i have a very strong interest in education and education of 
the handicapped she said that comes from what ive seen in 
how hard it is to get an education

the american medical associations top executive 
said he made mistakes in approving two moneylosing internal 
financial deals but denied that the resulting controversy spurred 
him to retire 
i accept responsibility for the errors and the changes that 
are needed to prevent their recurrence ama executive vice 
president dr james h sammons told the opening ceremony of the 
groups midyear meeting 
sammons and dr john j ring chairman of the board of trustees 
said in speeches to the ama house of delegates that sammons plans 
to retire at the end of his current contract were known months ago 
the 425 delegates are meeting through wednesday to set ama 
policy on numerous national healthcare issues but the internal 
financial controversy has captured much of their attention the 
chicagobased ama is the nations largest organization for doctors 
with nearly 300000 members 
the controversy centers on revelations this fall that sammons 
approved a 353000 reimbursement to a former ama executive for 
losses in a 1987 highrisk stock market fund and a 1985 loan to 
another ama executive to buy a highprice condominium during the 
latters divorce 
the executive involved in the stockmarket loss has promised to 
pay back the money with interest the recipient of the 1985 loan 
later defaulted costing the ama 50000 to foreclose 
ring told the delegates an investigation is continuing and a 
full report will be made to the house of delegates he said the 
board would take steps so that this will not happen again 
the board on saturday issued a report saying sammons acted 
within his authority in the two deals but failed to follow the 
usual fiscal policies and procedures 
ama spokesman mark stuart said trustees declined to elaborate 
the board also said it had accepted sammons plan to retire 
effective march 31 1991 
stuart said it was unclear why the board had included the 
retirement plans in the report on the deals sammons who is widely 
respected for rescuing the ama from financial disaster when he took 
the job in 1974 plans to give up daytoday management of the ama 
at the end of next year 
the board report also proposed a restructuring of its committees 
and hiring of an outside accounting firm it said the board would 
set tighter fiscal limits on the authority of the executive vice 
president but did not elaborate 
the house of delegates also will consider a resolution passed 
last month by the washington state medical association urging 
sammons be placed on administrative leave until the investigation 
is completed 
on sunday secretary of education lauro cavazos asked the 
physicians for help in improving and restructuring the nations 
education system he asked the physicians to help raise public 
awareness of the nations educational shortcomings 
during the meetings the ama delegates also will consider 
reports and resolutions that would 
acknowledge a patients right to basic and essential health 
care 
establish policies regarding maternalfetal conflict such 
as when an expectant mother refuses medical treatment that would 
benefit her fetus 
encourage healthinsurance companies to develop reducedcost 
coverage for nonsmokers 
urge a lowering of the bloodalcohol level to 005 percent for 
determination of drunken driving 
work toward listing tobacco as a contributing factor on death 
certificates

east germanys fledgling opposition movement 
is splintered into at least five groups and lacks the kind of 
charismatic leader found in poland or czechoslovakia 
despite often diverging goals everyone agrees on the need to 
strip the communists of their 40year grip on absolute power and to 
hold the nations first free elections even the communists 
the communists and their allies keep stealing and adopting our 
positions to make themselves seem like a new and more trustworthy 
force complains lutheran pastor rainer eppelmann an opposition 
leader 
unlike its communist neighbors the east german opposition has 
no major figure like lech walesa or vaclav havel and no patron like 
the roman catholic or protestant churches east germanys 
bestknown opposition figure is new forums baerbel bohley a 
44yearold east berlin artist and painter 
and while solidarity had years of struggle that also let the 
polish opposition finetune its platform east germanys 
prodemocracy forces suddenly have been thrown into the breach 
the groups have been operating completely in the open for only 
two months and free elections could be held as early as autumn 
opposition leaders are scheduled to meet the communists on dec 7 
to discuss the nations future 
the activists have made a series of sometimes divergent demands 
they range from a better environment to a free choice on unity for 
the two germanys some disagree on unification and on whether to 
make the statecontrolled economy more marketoriented 
new forum is the largest group with about 200000 members and 
made up in large part of young street protesters other groups 
include the 150member greens party the social democrats 
democracy now and eppelmanns demokratische aufbruch which means 
democratic start or awakening 
eppelmann a genial lutheran cleric in jeans and running shoes 
said the countrys only hope lies in a multiparty system embracing 
the communists their allies and the new opposition parties 
the established ones cant go it alone and the new groups 
cant do it alone he said there will have to be a grand 
coalition of internal reason 
just where that coalition would head remains unclear and even 
eppelmann acknowledges its difficult to say if there is room for 
all the envisioned participants in the new government 
there has to be a pluralistic spectrum of organizations where 
we can then develop a majority said local new forum leader 
christoph poehlmann in east berlins pankow district and there 
can only be majorities when there is diversity first 
but poehlmann acknowledged the time for just asking questions 
is behind us there is growing support for running candidates 
right now it is uncertain whether the opposition will run as 
one group or as scattered forces against the communists 
replacing the communists with another bloc that lays claim to 
power and perhaps to truth in a monolithic way is not our goal 
poehlmann said during a weekend meeting 
in one sense new forum despite massive publicity and support 
is having growing pains in changing from a market place for ideas 
to a true political force 
the basic idea of new forum was to think about what we can do 
in this country where can it go do we want to be like the west a 
consumer society said new forum cofounder luise schramm that 
process continues in eight weeks you cant reach conclusions 
new forums leaders want to keep some components of east 
germanys socialist structure while warning that growing talk of 
reunification threatens to derail the reform process in the country 
of 165 million people 
a public opinion poll published by west germanys stern magazine 
said if elections were held now new forum would be the winner with 
22 percent of the vote the communists would be in third place 
behind the communistallied liberal democratic party stern said 
mounting an election campaign in a western sense would be amost 
impossible in a country where essentials like typewriters and 
photocopying machines are in short supply and where the national 
telephone system seems on the verge of collapse 
the opposition also is likely to find itself being courted and 
perhaps partially coopted by the communists themselves 
ingo klein a member of new forum and the communist party said 
east germany is suffering from a lack of new concepts that 
brought the opposition into being in the first place 
klein estimated that 10 percent of new forums members belong to 
the 2million strong communist party adding he looks forward to 
a government of all the important forces that unite this country 
klein a 39yearold university economist insists there will be 
no contradication in his dual membership even when new forum runs 
candidates against the communists 
i wouldnt be the servant of two masters he said with a 
smile saying he can still support both groups

with the completion of its first 
multiparty election ever this island of 20 million people already 
credited with an economic miracle is poised for a political one 
but the challenges are great 
the political equation of taiwan was rearranged over the weekend 
observers hailed the vote as a step forward for democracy even 
though it was marred by allegations of widespread votebuying a 
nationalist setback redistribution of political power read one 
newspaper headline 
most stunning indeed were the losses suffered by the 
nationalist party which has ruled taiwan for 40 years after 
fleeing a communist takeover on the chinese mainland nationalist 
candidates polled 58 percent of the popular vote down from 70 
percent in 1986 
next in line came the strong showing of a feisty 2yearold 
opposition party which won important posts in local elections and 
gained in the national legislature 
this is a glorious victory said opposition leader tsai 
shiyuan 
the democratic progressive party of which tsai is deputy 
secretary general garnered 33 percent of the vote and independent 
allies swelled its total to nearly 40 percent two years ago it 
won 22 percent 
much of the partys support came from native taiwanese who make 
up about 80 percent of the population but were displaced 
politically when the nationalists seized power in 1949 
a third development was the relatively free debate in the 
campaign one candidate a former dancer ran on a platform of free 
love she lost 
others openly risked charges of sedition when they called on 
taiwan to declare itself independent from china and abandon the 
dream of recovering the mainland at least 20 of 32 members of a 
proindependence group won seats in various contests 
taiwans rapid economic growth in the 1970s created an 
increasingly sophisticated population which chafed at laws that 
could jail men and women for speaking their minds 
several years after the 1975 death of autocratic president 
chiang kaishek the nationalists began experimenting with 
political reform martial law was lifted in 1987 after 38 years 
limited press freedoms were granted political parties were 
legalized 
but many said reforms came too slow and the vote saturday 
appears to be a rejection of the pace of change in a political 
system that still perpetuates nationalist rule 
television and radio remain under nationalist control and were 
criticized throughout the campaign for antiopposition reporting 
even if the opposition won every vote it could not have 
challenged nationalist control the 256seat legislature and the 
electoral college are dominated by hundreds of elderly nationalists 
elected for life on the chinese mainland in the late 1940s and 
frozen in office to support the partys claim to be the legitimate 
ruler of all china 
despite the problems the oppositions made huge gains 
in the legislature the opposition and its allies won at least 
21 seats up from 12 seats for the first time in taiwans history 
the opposition can introduce legislation because 20 cosponsors are 
required for each bill 
the opposition also captured six of the countrys 16 county 
executive posts and other local seats with these victories the 
opposition is presented with the challenge of proving it can run a 
local government and solve environmental problems and a 
skyrocketing crime rate 
the opposition also can move to limit the farreaching control 
of the nationalists over everyday life 
a model cited by many is an independent candidate who was 
elected as county executive of ilan in 1986 and is dismantling the 
nationalist party machine in his district 
surveillance files kept on government employees were burned 
pictures of nationalist leaders were taken down political 
indoctrination is being reduced in the schools and a nuclear power 
plant backed by nationalists was stopped 
one of the first things i will do is demolish the nationalist 
party headquarters said you ching in a speech to supporters 
after he won the executive seat in taipei county then you will 
be able to walk your dogs on the property 
still pundits have warned opposition candidates not to push the 
nationalists too far too fast 
although possibilities for a conservative backlash appear 
slight the nationalists might be tempted to pass legislation 
limiting the power of the local governments and negating opposition 
gains 
such tactics could spark unrest among the people allegations of 
voterigging during the election caused thousands to surround 
county offices early today about 10000 protesters who accused 
the nationalists of vote fraud ended a 30hour siege of a 
government office in southern taiwan 
for the nationalists the election challenged an aging party 
that has grown somewhat fat on the luxury of oneparty rule 
we calmly accept an upset party secretary general james 
soong said after a hastily held meeting of party leaders sunday 
we shall continue with reforms and improve what we did not do 
well 
some in the party have called for faster political reforms 
the vote shows the people demand change said cl chiou a 
political science professor the nationalists must bend with the 
wind

mayorelect david dinkins said he was not 
worried by a federal probe into a stock transfer to his son said 
to be part of a larger investigation into a cable television 
franchise 
im confident this inquiry will reveal that theres nothing 
with which i need to be concerned dinkins said sunday those 
of us in public life are subject to criticism and scrutiny of all 
sorts over time 
dinkins said the investigation stems from a suggestion by his 
defeated opponent in the nov 7 mayoral election republican 
rudolph giuliani who said during the campaign that the stock deal 
should be examined 
charles stillman an attorney for dinkins described the federal 
investigation as rudy giulianis last hurrah giuliani is the 
former manhattan us attorney 
the daily news reported sunday that andrew maloney us 
attorney based in brooklyn is investigating the transaction of 
stock by dinkins to his son david jr 
investigators are trying to determine whether dinkins 
transferred inner city broadcasting corp stock to his son through 
a genuine transaction in 1985 how much the stock was worth and 
whether all due taxes were paid the news reported 
inner city owns several radio stations and one of its 
subsidiaries has a substantial interest in queens innerunity cable 
systems a cable franchise inner citys chairman former manhattan 
borough president percy sutton is a longtime friend of dinkins 
dinkins has said he first acquired stock in the privately held 
company in 1972 and his holdings grew to 588 shares largely 
through stock splits 
after his election as manhattan borough president in 1985 
dinkins said he began transferring the stock to his son to avoid a 
conflict between his position on the city board of estimate and the 
boards role in regulating cable television 
ann driscoll a spokeswoman for the us attorney characterized 
the investigation as a preliminary inquiry into some financial 
transactions she refused to elaborate 
during the campaign it was revealed that dinkins had not paid a 
gift tax dinkins released a handwritten note dated oct 30 1985 
in which his son agreed to buy the stock but dinkins declined to 
release financial or corporate records that might further document 
the transaction 
as part of the investigation the news said the age of the 
paper and ink are being tested to determine whether the note was 
written in 1985 or during the campaign there also are plans to 
analyze the handwriting the newspaper said 
the citys department of investigation is conducting a separate 
previously disclosed probe into whether dinkins filed misleading 
financial disclosure forms pertaining to the stock

its monopoly on power gone the 
communist party is on the run looking desperately for new strength 
in the forthcoming political battle for control 
communists were the vanguard of reform during the illfated 
prague spring under alexander dubcek until the spontaneous 
freedom movement was squelched by soviet tanks in 1968 
but new forces seem to be in charge this time around 
the future requires giving up the monopoly of power new 
party leader karel urbanek said last week 
a 77yearold veteran communist says its hard to foresee any 
kind of real political comeback for the party now that the lies 
and incompetence are here for everyone to see hear and read about 
the man requesting anonymity said only a miracle can save 
the communist leadership from collapse now that the 2weekold 
peaceful popular revolt has shaken it to the core 
in a stormy party central commitee meeting nov 24 former 
premier lubomir strougal called the demonstrations an expression 
of civil dissatisfaction with us our way of leadership and rule 
let us admit our share of responsibility the party daily 
rude pravo quoted him as saying 
days later the party decided to revise its stand on the 1968 
warsaw pact invasion part of its speedy move to jettison the 
leaders and policies of the last 21 years 
those aging party members who carried the torch of real 
socialism from the 1948 communist takeover until november 1989 
have been spared a younger communist generations worries about the 
partys future 
im of the opinion that the entire communist party should be 
disbanded and possibly associate under a different name if we find 
the right program and people willing to do it vit spanhel 43 a 
communist journalist told the associated press 
that has already happened in hungary where the unpopular 
communist party dissolved itself last month and christened a new 
ruling party the socialists as part of its attempt to save 
itself from overwhelming defeat in free elections next year 
with a membership of 17 million roughly one in every six 
czechoslovak adults is a communist the party is still the best 
organized political force in the country 
it may be hit by massive defections now that its power is 
eroded but it still has control of thousands of offices and 
factories and many of the people who run them 
vaclav havel the countrys leading dissident and the unofficial 
leader of the civic forum opposition coalition says that by 
comparison his group is composed of political amateurs 
the countrys socialist party and peoples party formerly 
docile communist allies have now begun to flourish in the new 
atmosphere of free speech membership applications are pouring in 
but both parties still remain comparatively tiny forces of less 
than 50000 members 
a broad spectrum of several independent parties similar to that 
in hungary is expected to emerge before free elections take place 
probably late next year 
czechoslovak wits are beginning to mourn the easy target they 
found in the communists for 40 years 
hinting at the clumsiness of former leader milos jakes and the 
depressing obscurity of the new communist chief the writing on the 
subway wall said last week 
milos come back urbanek is no fun

former us attorney general 
ramsey clark says it will be difficult to find a competent lawyer 
to defend an american woman accused of hiding weapons for leftist 
guerrillas 
clark said sunday that the woman jennifer jean casolo had 
decided to stand trial in the case rather than be deported 
he said that even with a good lawyer it would be extremely 
difficult if not impossible for ms casolo to get a fair trial 
amid the pressure of war and the near paranoia about foreigners in 
el salvador 
ms casolo was due to be arraigned today he said most likely 
before a military tribunal he was not sure precisely what charges 
would be filed 
authorities say they uncovered a huge guerrilla arms stash 
buried in her yard clark said ms casolo didnt know the munitions 
and explosives were there 
ms casolo who represents a san antoniobased ecumenical group 
called christian educational seminars is deeply committed to her 
work in el salvador he said 
the formeer attorney general who has been retained by ms 
casolos family but is not licensed to practice law in el salvador 
said he had hoped ms casolo would agree to be deported rather than 
tried but that is not the case 
every heart has to be somewhere and her heart chose el 
salvador he said she doesnt want to go home 
clark said ms casolo has begun a ministry inside the jail where 
she has been held since her arrest nov 26 
ms casolo 28 a native of thomaston conn moved into the 
house in may but was not at home for long periods of time 
including all of september clark said 
ms casolos friends say she is being framed to justify a 
government crackdown on churches and humanitarian groups that came 
in reaction to a threeweekold guerrilla offensive 
the rebel farabundo marti national liberation front has denied 
any connection with ms casolo who was known for her work guiding 
visiting church groups and congressional aides 
the rightist government has imposed a state of siege that 
suspends most constitutional rights and the national assembly has 
passed a severe new antiterrorism law 
the bill has not yet been signed by president alfredo cristiani 
ms casolo came to el salvador in 1985 after working for two 
years with central american refugees in seattle 
authorities say they found more than 20000 rounds of ammunition 
for ak47 assault rifles 213 blocks of tnt detonators 106 60mm 
mortar rounds and other munitions buried in her yard 
ms casolo is being held in a cell with two other women clark

eden pastora the sandinista 
revolutionary hero turned contra rebel leader has ended eight 
years of exile and told supporters that neither moscow nor 
washington should influence managua 
the legendary fighter known as commander zero was mobbed on his 
arrival sunday at the airport in the nicaraguan capital 
a caravan of vehicles carried him and supporters to the former 
national palace where he and about 20 fighters in 1978 held 
legislators hostage until thenpresident anastasio somoza released 
50 sandinista prisoners including daniel ortega and tomas borge 
now the president and the interior minister 
i have come to take over the palace thats called nicaragua 
pastora told several hundred supporters who cheered wildly at the 
reference to the bold exploit that made him known worldwide 
pastora said the social christians not the leftist government 
or the usbacked opposition coalition are the true followers of 
nicaraguan nationalist hero augusto cesar sandino 
we are antiimperialist with moscow and we are 
antiimperialist with washington pastora told the crowd at the 
adjacent plaza of the revolution 
pastora scoffed at sandinista accusations that he betrayed the 
revolution when he left them to fight in 1983 with the usbacked 
contra rebels 
he said the sandinista commanders are the true 
counterrevolutionaries because their standards of living now are 
much higher than most nicaraguans 
pastora also said that although he personally respected 
opposition presidential candidate violeta chamorro her 14party 
national opposition union was made up of opportunists and followers 
of the late somoza 
pastoras reception at the airport organized by two factions of 
the social christian party was the largest by far for any of the 
many exiled leaders who have returned to nicaragua this year to 
join the political fight against the sandinistas 
on the way downtown pastora waved tentatively at people 
standing on sidewalks waiting for buses many of whom stared back 
with blank expressions 
standing with pastora were erick ramirez of the social christian 
party and mauricio diaz of the peoples social christian party 
two months ago diaz threw his support behind ramirezs 
presidential candidacy after splitting from ms chamorros 
coalition 
pastora has run a fishing cooperative in neighboring costa rica 
since he ended three years with the contras and quit the armed 
struggle against the sandinistas in 1986 
when the sandinistas came to power in 1979 in a popular revolt 
that forced somoza to flee the country pastora was named vice 
minister of defense and enjoyed wide popularity 
but the man who called himself a nationalist was at odds with 
his more radical leftist comrades and grew disillusioned with the 
sandinista revolution some say he grew bitter because he was not 
made defense minister 
pastora distanced himself from the sandinistas in 1981 then 
dropped from sight 
he emerged in 1983 and said he would fight the sandinistas but 
he constantly criticized his contra colleagues saying they 
misspent money 
the contras welcomed the propaganda coup provided by his 
defection but also eyed him suspiciously because of his independent 
streak and former sandinista ties 
pastora survived a 1984 bomb explosion that killed four people 
including an american journalist during a news conference in his 
jungle hideout on the costa rican border 
in 1986 the cia withdrew financial support for pastora and soon 
after he quit the fight

arrive has evolved in another way too it has become something 
of an advocacy force for a highrisk population without a voice 
since the start of 1988 intravenous drug users have accounted 
for more of the aids cases reported in the city than any other 
group in an anonymous random sampling about 35 percent of state 
prison inmates tested hivpositive 
arrive helps students draw up resumes and look for jobs 
especially in drug and aids counseling it gives out subway tokens 
and offers a 24hour source of support even to those who return to 
drugs 
we have to deal with the fact that theyre going to experiment 
and they will be pulled back into old behaviors said josepher 
sometimes the streets win thirtyseven percent of those who 
entered arrive didnt graduate according to figures from its first 
five groups of students dropout figures arent available for its 
two most recent groups including one that graduated friday 
some graduates get stipends to help others through the program 
in august one helper was shot to death in harlem 
many students left jail to find the streets changed filled 
with younger faces and more violence revolving around crack 
ive gotten a lot of feedback from our students that they feel 
like outsiders said joseph turner an arrive trainer 
producing a lot of discomfort for people whove had a history of 
substance abuse will drive them back to the drug 
those who stick it out are often people whove shown their 
strength before earl ray got himself off speedballs a mixture of 
heroin and cocaine at age 24 at 30 he was ordered imprisoned for 
nine years for manslaughter once inside he sent himself back to 
school 
now he works for narcotic and drug research inc which runs 
arrive going to prisons to recruit prospective students he lives 
with a sister whos on crack his brother is an intravenous drug 
user 
i knew that i would either come back out here and be part of 
the problem or part of the solution ray said 
jenny melendez 35 freed herself from a whirlpool of cocaine 
alcohol and compulsive gambling 
i used to gamble my food stamps she said she joined arrive 
with her husband who is in a drugrehabilitation program at home 
she tells their six children ages 4 months to 16 years what she 
learns at arrive 
i want to go to school and teach children about aids she 
said i want to spread what i learned 
arrive is funded by the national institute on drug abuse and 
the students are part of an experiment that will compare them with 
other excons who get less treatment or no treatment at all all 
told a research subject can earn 280 for completing the program 
its enough to bring people in but not enough to keep them says 
wexler people who dont get motivated who dont get connected 
they just leave 
it helps that the teachers know well where the students have 
been josepher says he and turner spent time in jail and used drugs 
one of the main problems in the beginning is imparting to them 
visions of hope said turner 
ive got to teach them about selfrespect said josepher 
ive got to help them to see that theyre selfdestructive and 
this translates into anger directed at themselves

hospital patients face a greater risk of 
infection or inappropriate surgery because many hospitals arent 
meeting quality standards according to the head of a group that 
monitors healthcare facilities 
more than a third of us hospitals failed to meet quality 
standards designed to guard against inappropriate surgery 
unnecessary blood transfusions and poorly coordinated treatment in 
special coronary and intensivecare units according to a report in 
sundays chicago tribune 
the report also found that more than 40 percent of hospitals 
were cited for violations of safety standards ranging from 
inadequate electrical wiring to improper disposal of hazardous 
waste 
the report was based on surveys of 5208 facilities collected 
from 1986 to 1988 by the joint commission on accreditation of 
healthcare organizations which sets quality standards for 
healthcare facilities 
the chicagobased commission said it had not analyzed the data 
to determine how many violations were major 
but the commissions president dr dennis oleary said 
compliance problems mean that there is a greater risk of a bad 
outcome such as infection in the hospital or a transfusion 
reaction or a surgical misadventure 
we consider that to be serious he said 
oleary said more and more hospitals are letting their buildings 
run down because of financial pressures do hospitals have 
adequate resources to really comply with the standards maybe 
not oleary said 
the tribune reported that the commission found that 
fiftyone percent of hospitals did not have adequate procedures 
for reviewing surgery to determine whether it should have been done 
and whether it was done correctly 
fiftysix percent did not properly monitor and evaluate how 
well the medical staff in different departments gave care 
fifty percent did not properly monitor what happened to 
patients in special intensivecare and coronarycare units 
thirtyfive percent did not always review blood transfusion 
procedures to determine whether a patient needed a transfusion and 
whether whole blood or blood components should have been used 
blood components carry less risk of infection from viruses that 
cannot be detected by current screening tests such as hepatitis c 
about fivesixths of the nations hospitals are surveyed by the 
joint commission whose seal of approval qualifies them to get 
medicare and medicaid reimbursements without an extra government 
inspection 
barry bader a quality consultant based in rockville md said 
the pattern of problems indicated that physicians are increasingly 
reluctant to review each others care in the hospital either 
because of the time required or the fear of lawsuits 
that doesnt mean patients are getting poor care only that 
hospitals often are uninformed about what kind of care they are 
giving bader said 
dr sidney wolfe director of the washington dcbased public 
citizen health research group said the commission should publicly 
disclose its compliance data for individual hospitals 
if youre going to be a regulatory agency you have to let the 
public know what youre finding wolfe said

borders to the west opened 
today and czechs and slovaks crossed over them by the thousands as 
their countrys communist authorities allowed the first 
unrestricted travel in decades 
maybe this is truly freedom said stanislaw balaz who drove 
through the bratislavaberg crossing with his wife and 14yearold 
daughter en route to vienna 42 miles away 
the new openborder policy took effect at midnight balazs car 
was among more than 100 lined up at the crossing when the 
czechoslovak and austrian border guards shook hands then opened 
the barrier at 1204 am 
czechoslovak border guards reported a relatively light flow of 
traffic at the 20 rail and road crossings to austria throughout the 
morning probably a reflection of today being a regular working 
day 
austrian border officials said about 900 czechoslovak cars had 
passed through the bratislavaberg crossing by noon 
at other crossings the number of czechoslovaks traveling to 
austria was much smaller 
instead of a storm just a breeze the austria press agency 
headlined a report referring to the unexpectedly low number of 
visitors 
the news agency said most of the czechoslovaks were sightseeing 
and few had enough convertible currency for shopping 
however for those who had lined up at the bratislavaberg 
crossing the mood was ebullient as the barrier lifted 
this is an indescribable feeling said jan spurny 25 as he 
and his brother dusan drove their yellow wartburg sedan onto 
austrian territory 
television lights and a small crowd of wellwishers with a sign 
reading welcome to austria greeted the new arrivals 
the communist government announced thursday that all obstacles 
to travel to the west would be removed it was among the 
concessions granted after weeks of prodemocracy demonstrations by 
hundreds of thousands of people 
the move came after the east german government spurred by 
similar mass protests announced nearly one month ago that it was 
opening its western borders including the berlin wall 
in czechoslovakia travel regulations introduced in 1987 had 
made visits to the west easier for czechoslovaks than for most 
citizens of other sovietbloc countries but there were still 
formidable bureaucratic obstacles 
before the borders opened today those seeking to go west needed 
a passport they also needed authorization from the police from 
their workplace or school and in some cases from local communist 
party officials to get an exit visa they also had to have 
invitations from relatives or friends in the west 
now they need only to show their passports and fill out a brief 
questionnaire giving their names addresses the country they will 
visit and the duration of their stay 
only one czechoslovak soldier was on duty at the bratislavaberg 
crossing of a twolane road when the first austriabound cars 
arrived about 10 pm 
dusan spurney 22 said im just going to drive across and 
then drive right back i just want to see if it works

anyone brave or foolish enough to 
venture outside in the countrys swankiest district was a target 
even nuns were shot at in makati today where fighting between 
rebel and loyalist soldiers pinned down hundreds of foreigners for 
a third day insurgent snipers had sheltered themselves in 
apartment buildings and hotels 
canadian ambassador andre simard said the rebels were using 
americans japanese and others as human shields in their 
flagging 4dayold coup attempt 
at least three people were reported slain in makati today and 15 
wounded including one american in the fighting earlier 
spokesmen for the makati medical center said 10 people were killed 
they said the discrepancy was due to an error in records 
hundreds of rebel soldiers swarmed into makatis commercial 
district saturday turning about 20 luxury hotels and highrise 
apartment and office complexes into snipers dens 
they shot at anyone venturing outside 
literally were in the middle said barbara julich a new 
york businesswoman trapped in the intercontinental hotel were 
now low on food there are babies in the building and there is no 
baby food and the mothers are hysterical 
we saw were a group of nuns trying to walk where the tanks 
are they were eventually shot at and took cover 
jerry huchel spokesman for the us embassy estimated 210 
americans in three luxury hotels in the battle area he said that 
did not include scores of other americans who may be living in 
expensive apartments nearby 
its not a hostage situation but they just cant leave 
he said 
the presence of the foreigners and residents has prevented 
government forces from waging an assault to wipe out the last 
pockets of resistance and officials believe the standoff could 
last for days 
ambassador simard blamed the rebels for keeping the foreigners 
in the area home to the countrys two stock exchanges and its most 
exclusive boutiques theyre certainly using these people as 
human shields in my view he said 
electricity was cut briefly today after a stray bullet knocked 
out a transformer 
the japanese newspaper asahi said all 600 guests at the nikko 
manila garden hotel were herded into the basement sunday when 
rebels entered the building to demand food it was not clear if 
they were still there 
asahi said about 300 japanese were trapped in makati hotels and 
another 300 were living in apartments in the area 
my advice to them is to stay away from windows stay in your 
room and keep good courage said west german ambassador peter 
scholz we have to live out this phase

a swedish court today identified a 
palestinian living in sweden as a suspect in the bombing of pan am 
flight 103 and approved the seizure of evidence during a raid on 
his apartment last week 
the district court granting a request by scottish detectives to 
authorize the seizure of 15 bags of clothing said it found 
mohammed abo talb is suspected in scotland of murder or as an 
accessory to murder 
the court said the clothing taken one week ago from abo talbs 
apartment can be presumed to carry significance for the 
investigation and the seizure was therefore legal 
it was believed to be the first time a suspect has faced a court 
proceeding for the explosion dec 21 1988 of the pan am flight 
over lockerbie scotland that killed 270 people 
abo talb 35 was in jail awaiting a verdict on separate charges 
of murder and attempted murder for complicity in a series of bomb 
attacks in scandinavia and holland in 1985 and 1986 one bomb in 
copenhagen killed one person and wounded more than 20 
abo talb a former activist in the palestine popular struggle 
front group was linked to flight 103 when it was established that 
he was in malta two months before the explosion 
investigators reportedly traced clothing bought in malta to the 
suitcase which they believe also contained the bomb 
the pressuresensitive bomb apparently was transported in the 
suitcase from malta to frankfurt where it was put on board the new 
yorkbound flight according to the investigators reported theory 
seven swedish policemen and three scottish detectives raided abo 
talbs apartment last monday apparently searching for clothing 
that could be linked to the shreds found in lockerbie 
on friday the public prosecutor acting on behalf of the 
scottish detectives asked the court to sanction the seizure as 
legal 
under swedish law evidence taken for a police investigation 
outside sweden must be authorized by a court the court also must 
approve its removal from the country 
the decision which was printed and distributed at the 
courthouse by a clerk said that any property removed from sweden 
must be returned at the end of the investigation 
it also confirmed a previous decision to classify the court 
records in the case as secret 
jamila mograbi abo talbs exwife who still lives with him 
said detectives took all the familys clothing and she said she 
had to borrow clothes from friends for herself and her two children 
speaking to reporters on friday she said the policemen 
searching the apartment questioned her for one hour and that she 
was called to an uppsala police station later in the week for 
further interrogation 
according to court documents abo talb was born in lebanon 
served in the egyptian army and underwent training in the soviet 
union in handling antiaircraft missiles 
he deserted in 1970 to join the popular struggle front a 
radical offshoot of the palestine liberation organization he 
returned to the soviet union for further training in 1980 
abo talb immigrated to sweden in 1986

premier hans modrow who is emerging as east 
germanys top political figure is a reformminded communist long 
shunned and criticized by the former hardline leaders 
many see modrow 61 as east germanys equivalent to soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev whose domestic programs of greater 
openness and economic restructuring caught on among the east german 
public 
modrow was elected premier or head of government on nov 14 
after years of waiting as local party leader in dresden he was 
named today to handle any communist party issues that arise during 
the current warsaw pact summit in moscow 
it was also modrows duty to inform the edgy moscow leadership 
about the growing upheaval in east germany where the soviets have 
nearly 400000 troops 
despite the clear signs of ascent it is still too early to 
predict who will finally come out on top as east germany goes 
through widespread and seemingly uncontrollable changes 
the communist party which still counts an estimated 2 million 
members is preparing for an emergency session on dec 1517 that 
will elect a new leadership but even then with party support 
dropping and a greater risk of a breakup the communists future is 
increasingly clouded 
modrow himself has been among those giving a gloomy assessment 
of the partys chances saying the communists would get no more 
than 20 percent of the vote if promised free elections were held 
today 
the premier in his inaugural speech to parliament on nov 17 
appealed for more private enterprise to help rescue the countrys 
troubled economy 
modrow said east germany is open for proposals on joint 
ventures investment transfer of profits and environmental pilot 
projects all of which address some of the concerns of western 
businesses looking for openings in the east german market 
he called for a better socialism with more supplies of 
consumer goods for the nations 165 million people he rejected 
talk of german reunification as dangerous and unrealistic while 
calling for increased treaty links between the two countries 
long known as an antiestablishment communist modrow was the 
target of an inquisition led by then hardline leader erich 
honecker 
the attacks temporarily derailed his career as a nationwide 
leader forcing him to stay as local party chief in his power base 
of dresden 
in june central authorities singled him out for rare public 
criticism saying he had failed to control bourgeois and enemy 
views in dresden after a large demonstration of citizens 
demanding freedom of travel to the west 
an engineer by trade and the holder of a university economics 
degree modrow already has wielded far more clout as premier than 
his colorless predecessor willi stoph 
many east germans as well as soviet officials made plain they 
would have preferred modrow in the post of communist party 
secretary but the job went to honecker protege egon krenz on oct 
18 
as 10000 demonstrators rallied in east berlin on sunday many 
carried placards saying all of the top communist leaders should 
quit except modrow 
with krenz now out that leaves open the possibility for a 
modrow shot at the top party job if the structure stays the same 
there are already growing warnings about a possible breakup of the 
troubled party while many say a name change at least is possible 
married and the father of two children modrow began his party 
career as chief of the communist youth organization in east berlin 
from 1953 to 1961 he won election to the 163member central 
committee in 1967 and became dresden party secretary in 1973 
modrow won massive support in dresden in part because he 
rejected party perks and insisted on living in a normal apartment 
his wife reportedly waited in lines at stores like other local 
homemakers 
the premier stunned east berliners by walking home rather than 
being driven after his nov 17 speech in parliament

the israelibacked south lebanon army 
militia today pounded two shiite moslem towns with artillery fire 
killing four people and wounding 18 police said 
the bombardment just north of israels selfdesignated security 
zone coincided with renewed fighting between the two main shiite 
militia factions in the southern villages of sohmor and yohmor 
police said at least 20 people were killed or wounded in the 
hostilities between the proiranian hezbollah or party of god and 
the amal militia the police report did not provide a casualty 
breakdown

fighting 
the two factions are locked in a 2yearold struggle for 
control of lebanons 12 million shiites who make up the countrys 
largest single sect 
by police count at least 535 people have been killed and 1490 
wounded in amalhezbollah clashes since may 1987 
today was the third consecutive day the towns of nabatiyeh and 
neighboring kfar rumman which have a combined population of 
140000 have come under sla artillery fire five people have been 
killed and 38 wounded in the violence 
the sla said in a statement broadcast by its voice of the south 
radio station that the bombardment was in retaliation for assaults 
by shiite guerrillas saturday and sunday in which three sla 
militiamen were killed and five wounded 
the lebanese government instructed un ambassador rashid 
fakhoury to lodge a complaint with the security council about the 
sla attacks 
a foreign ministry statement said the lebanese government 
reserved the right to ask for a security council debate of the 
brutal attacks by israel and its surrogates in south lebanon 
the sla and israeli troops patrol israels selfproclaimed 
security zone israel carved out the area in 1985 when it withdrew 
the bulk of its occupation army from lebanon 
the enclave designed to serve as a buffer against crossborder 
raids into northern israel covers 328 square miles

opposition leaders urged people to 
stage mass demonstrations today to protest a new cabinet that did 
not meet their demands thousands of czechs and slovaks poured 
across the nations newly opened borders 
the opposition civic forum also threatened a general strike to 
protest the government named sunday all but five of the new 
cabinets 21 members are communists 11 members including premier 
ladislav adamec are holdovers 
civic forum denounced the appointments and called for new 
protests today on wenceslas square the center of two weeks of 
prodemocracy demonstrations that forced the communists to bow to 
demands for reform 
there were no demonstrations by early afternoon 
in the past nine days the communist party has seen its 41year 
monopoly on power removed from the constitution been forced to 
oust hardline leaders and reversed 21 years of policy by admitting 
that 1968s sovietled invasion that crushed reform was a mistake 
today the government lifted virtually all restrictions on 
foreign travel and border guards reported a light but steady flow 
of traffic at the 20 rail and road crossings into austria it was 
the first unrestricted travel in decades 
maybe this is truly freedom said stanislaw balaz who drove 
through the bratislavaberg crossing with his wife and 14yearold 
daughter en route to vienna 42 miles away 
the openborder policy took effect at midnight and by noon 
about 3000 czechoslovaks had crossed into austria border guards 
said traffic may have been relatively light because today was a 
workday lack of hard cash might also have kept travel light 
striking students whose protests of police brutality at a nov 
17 demonstration sparked czechoslovakias peaceful revolt greeted 
radio reports on the cabinet with derisive laughter at their 
headquarters 
they dropped plans to end the strike and return to classes today 
the call for a new protest and civic forums general objections 
to the new government were printed in staterun dailies only one 
newspaper the trade union daily prace carried the threat of a 
general strike 
peter miller a civic forum spokesman at pragues ckd heavy 
industry factory said there would be a general strike next monday 
unless a new government is announced by dec 10 
its the only way for citizens to show what they want said 
miller one of several opposition representatives interviewed on 
state television 
theater director miroslav machacek representing striking 
actors said artists were ready to back a general strike 
we have to fight to the end until we are certain that the 
path to freedom in this country is irreversible he said 
strike committees at enterprises nationwide have remained on 
alert since last week when millions followed an opposition call to 
strike for two hours to show they reject oneparty rule 
the next day adamec agreed to drop the communist partys 
leading role from the constitution and form the first coalition 
government in 21 years 
petr pithart a civic forum representative said the opposition 
wants to replace foreign minister jaromir johanes a holdover 
criticized for his defense of harsh human rights policies and 
energy minister antonin krumnikl held responsible for widespread 
pollution 
the opposition also seeks new laws that would guarantee 
democratic rights of assembly association and a free press and 
pave the way for free elections 
first deputy premier bohumil urban in announcing the new 
government team at a news conference said all the demands of 
civic forum could not yet at this stage be respected 
some of the unmet demands included a civilian defense minister 
and a noncommunist head of the interior ministry which is in 
charge of police 
the five noncommunists included three people without party 
affiliation and one person each from the socialist and peoples 
parties traditionally allied with the communists but more 
independent in recent months 
josef hromadka a highranking leader of czechoslovakias 
protestant church became one of seven deputy premiers 
communist authorities have traditionally kept a tight rein on 
religion exercising veto power over all church appointments in 
this nation which is 65 percent roman catholic 
gen miroslav vacek became defense minister and communist 
frantisek pinc a political unknown who had served as director of a 
nuclear power station was named interior minister 
at its first meeting the new government condemned the 1968 
warsaw pact invasion and appointed johanes to negotiate with moscow 
on the future of the estimated 80000 soviet troops stationed in 
czechoslovakia since 
the move was clearly intended to try to gain suport from a 
population that was horrified by the invasion and hated the leaders 
installed by moscow afterwards to crush the prague spring 
reforms 
the last of those leaders left in power is president gustav 
husak who indicated as he swore in the new cabinet on sunday that 
he may step down 
i dont have any ambitions to remain in my function he 
said according to the state news agency ctk he added however 
that a decision to quit would come only after consultations between 
political and oppposition groups 
the opposition has demanded his resignation by next sunday 
adamec johanes and communist party chief karel urbanek left 
sunday for moscow where warsaw pact leaders are meeting 
each country that took party in the 1968 invasion has now 
officially criticized its participation

whos a who 
thats the question the editors of whos who in america must 
decide as they prepare listings for the 199091 edition of the 
reference book 
actor eric roberts will be listed in the new whos who but mr 
t star of the canceled ateam tv series will not be baseball 
slugger jose canseco of the oakland as is a who but national 
league rookie of the year jerome walton the chicago cubs 
centerfielder is not 
walton was rookie of the year true explained john l 
daniels product manager for whos who in america but you dont 
know what about his sophomore year what if he fizzles 
once someone is listed its for life until retirement until 
someone asks to be left out or until conviction for a serious 
crime daniels said 
sometimes the editors look the other way at a conviction as in 
the case of watergate convicts john ehrlichman hr haldeman and 
charles colson who continue to be listed 
thousands of questionnaires were mailed this fall from whos who 
headquarters in this northern chicago suburb to nobel laureates 
federal judges movie stars fortune 500 company officials 
newspaper editors junior partners in major accounting firms 
upandcoming lawyers and others 
researchers at the headquarters comb through newspapers 
magazines and corporate reports for prospective listees 
we try to be as objective as we can be in our standards 
daniels said we try to quantify quality 
those who return the questionnaires providing information about 
their accomplishments memberships education and the like are 
guaranteed a place among the 79000 people to be listed in the new 
edition due out in september 1990 
daniels said the expected return rate is only 12 percent to 14 
percent years ago as many as 20 percent returned the 
questionnaires 
he said the rate has dropped because people are confused by the 
proliferation of such books many of them vanity press 
publications that charge for a listing 
in contrast whos who in america a publication of 
macmillan inc makes clear in its preface that its entries dont 
have to buy the book 
daniels said he receives up to 50 unsolicited nominations for 
new entrants each week either from admirers or the wouldbe 
personalities themselves 
the publication has been in business since 1899 new editions 
are published every two years 
albert nelson marquis a chicago publisher founded the 
publication after seeing a similar book in britain the idea was 
not to confer celebrity status on certain people but to provide a 
useful reference book to businesses and libraries 
the book does have a history of keeping a who or two out 
frank lloyd wright was refused a listing for years because 
marquis objected to the architects unsettled married life 
marquis also barred 1930s hollywood star mae west from the big 
red book that prompted her to respond well the old boy who 
publishes that isnt in my little black book either

sales of new homes edged down 05 percent in 
october the sixth monthly decline of the year but a major 
improvement over the previous month the government reported today 
the commerce department said new singlefamily homes were sold 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 649000 units in october 
after a 102 percent plunge in september 
the september decrease was revised downward from a 14 percent 
fall originally reported last month 
fixedrate mortgage interest rates fell to 982 percent by the 
end of october after rising into the double digits in september 
analysts had said the lower rates would lead to an improvement in 
the housing industry 
the national association of realtors reported last week that 
sales of existing homes remained steady in october at their highest 
level since last january and nar chief economist john a tuccillo 
said then that home financing conditions probably will stay quite 
favorable in the months ahead 
the housing industry was among the hardest hit when the federal 
reserve pumped up interest rates last year to slow the economy and 
thus contain inflation but as inflationary pressures cooled the 
fed has permitted gradual decreases in rates since the beginning of 
the summer 
the realtors association reported today that its index measuring 
the ability of the typical american family to buy an existing home 
rose in october to its highest level in eight months because of 
stable rates and a drop in the median home price 
the real estate group said the index rose to 1061 from 1035 
in september and the highest since it measured 1067 last february 
that means a family with a median income of 33365 had 1061 
percent of the income needed to buy a medianpriced existing home 
costing 92100 
the median means that half of the families earn more and half 
less or that half the homes sell for more and half for less 
the commerce department report today said the median price of a 
new home was 127900 in october up 53 percent from 121500 in 
september the average price of a new home was unchanged at 
151900 
newhome sales for the first nine months were down 44 percent 
from the same period in 1988 
sales rose 478 percent in the northeast but fell 247 percent 
in the west the south posted a 57 percent increase while the 
midwest recorded a 37 percent gain 
the realtors meanwhile said a family in the northeast earning 
the median income of 37329 had only 761 percent of the income 
needed to buy medianpriced existing home costing 143300 
in the west a family earning the median income of 35299 had 
741 percent of the income needed to buy a home priced at 142200 
in the south a family earning the median income of 30533 had 
1074 percent of the income needed to buy an 83400 home while a 
midwestern family earning the median of 33511 had 1375 percent 
of the income needed to purchase a home priced at 70900

prime minister zeid bin shaker resigned 
today and king hussein named his court chief mudar badran to form 
a new government official sources reported 
the new cabinet will have the task of negotiating with jordans 
new parliament including islamic fundamentalists on legislation 
an official at the prime ministers office speaking on 
condition of anonymity said bin shaker 55 a distant cousin of 
the king will take over as royal court chief 
the appointment of badran 55 who has the reputation in the 
arab world of being a strong persuasive politician came as a 
surprise most observers had expected bin shaker to stay on and 
form a new cabinet 
badrans appointment signaled concern over the deterioration in 
jordans relations with neighboring syria over syrias military 
occupation of lebanon 
the official told the associated press that a new cabinet will 
have to seek a vote of confidence in parliament within 30 days 
the new cabinet will include former ministers some members of 
the royally appointed senate and some of the newly elected 
80member chamber of deputies he said 
under jordans constitution bin shakers government had been 
expected to resign following the nov 8 parliamentary elections 
the first nationwide poll in 22 years amid king husseins move 
toward wider democracy 
bin shaker formed his transitional government april 27 following 
a wave of riots in southern jordan over price hikes in basic food 
commodities and fuel at least nine people were killed 
he was charged with overseeing the general elections and halting 
a sharp slide in the economy that has cut per capita income from 
2000 a year to about 1200 
badran is known to sympathize with extremist moslem factions 
including the moslem brotherhood movement which won 25 seats in 
parliament in the recent elections nine other fundamentalists also 
won the election 
the new government will have to negotiate with the 
fundamentalists to pass its own legislative program through 
parliament which approves all laws and has the power to dismiss 
prime ministers and their cabinets 
but ultimate authority remains in the hands of the king who has 
the power to dissolve parliament and rule by decree

the supreme court in an important banking 
industry case agreed today to decide whether us banks with 
branch offices overseas must pay depositors after foreign 
governments seize or freeze those accounts 
the court said it will review rulings that required citibank to 
pay depositors 
robert h bork whose supreme court nomination was defeated by 
the senate in 1987 is representing citibank 
in the appeal acted on today bork said billions of dollars are 
at stake there are more than 900 branches of us banks operating 
in 73 countries with some 225 billion in deposits 
the case acted on today stems from economic troubles in the 
philippines in 1983 
wells fargo asia limited in singapore deposited 2 million with 
the citibank branch in manila in june 1983 the money was to be 
repaid with interest six months later 
but on oct 15 1983 the philippine government of ferdinand 
marcos who was deposed and fled to hawaii in 1986 froze the 
accounts of foreign banks the move prevented citibank from 
repaying the manila deposits to wells fargo 
wells fargo sued to recover the money and citibank later paid 
it 934000 citibank withheld the balance of the original deposit 
a federal judge in 1987 ordered citibank to repay the balance in 
1987 and the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld the ruling 
last july 
the appeals court relied on an agreement between the two banks 
that suggested citibanks home office in new york city had the duty 
to pay the money 
the bush administration urged the supreme court to review 
citibanks appeal in the philippine case and to rule in the banks 
favor justice department lawyers offered their views at the 
request of the high court 
the case is citibank vs wells fargo 881260

usbacked afghan insurgents said 
today that an afghan army general and three guerrilla commanders 
were killed in fighting outside that nations eastern city of 
jalalabad 
guerrilla sources also claimed to have crushed a major offensive 
by the communist government to retake strategic positions outside 
kabul the afghan capital 
midia a news agency run by various guerrilla factions reported 
that brig gen ghulam haider was killed saturday when moslem 
insurgents launched an artillery attack on army headquarters in 
jalalabad 
guerrillas said haider was the third afghan army general to be 
killed in fighting in the past month 
the guerrilla news agency claimed three government army officers 
were captured and a fourth defected during fighting outside 
jalalabad 
the insurgents have been trying for nine months to capture the 
strategic city 
the guerrillas also said three of their key commanders were 
killed during the past week 
they said khalid a commander who uses only one name died when 
he stepped on a mine outside jalalabad while trying to retrieve the 
bodies of some fighters killed in an earlier clash 
guerrilla sources said khalid was a leader in offensives earlier 
this year that eventually gave the insurgents control of the 
45mile strategic highway leading from jalalabad to the pakistan 
border 
the guerrilla news agency said commander abdul matin was hit in 
an artillery attack near rodat about 24 miles west of the pakistan 
border 
it said commander zarab gul khomeni died along with five rebels 
during a weekend attack on government positions near surkhrud six 
miles west of jalalabad 
the city has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting in 
the guerrillas 11yearold war to overthrow successive communist 
governments in kabul 
the insurgents began their battle for the city last march about 
three weeks after the last soviet soldiers left afghanistan their 
departure ended nine years of soviet military intervention 
kabuls ruling communists control most of afghanistans cities 
and the insurgents control most of the countryside

government troops led by afghan defense minister gen shahnawaz 
tanai tried unsuccessfully to rout insurgents from posts at 
chakaray and illajay outside kabul 
the fighting which reportedly was centered about 18 miles 
southeast of kabul could not be independently confirmed

used antiaircraft weapons to shoot down a government transport 
plane saturday the report did not say how many people were on

the supreme court today left intact a ruling 
that limits the power of states and their citizens to block 
shipments of hazardous waste from other states 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by alabama 
officials who failed to prevent shipments of hazardous waste from 
an abandoned texas chemical refinery to alabama 
alabama officials said they were denied a fair opportunity to 
oppose the shipments 
the plans for removing the waste to alabama were approved by the 
us environmental protection agency under the socalled superfund 
law of 1980 aimed at helping clean up toxic waste 
the epa included an abandoned geneva industries inc 
petrochemical plant in houston among priority sites to be cleaned 
up the site is contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs 
and other toxic chemicals 
epa officials in 1986 in cooperation with texas officials 
approved removal of the waste to another location 
texas officials signed a contract with chemical waste management 
inc cwm to have 47000 tons of the waste shipped to the 
companys treatment facility in emelle ala 
alabama officials led by gov guy hunt said they unlawfully 
were denied a chance to participate in the process that led to the 
selection of the emelle facility 
a federal judge temporarily blocked the shipment of the waste 
but the 11th us circuit court of appeals overruled the judge in 
april and permitted the waste to be deposited at the alabama site 
the appeals court noted that the emelle facility is licensed by 
alabama and the federal government to handle such toxic wastes 
the appeals court added that federal laws controlling disposal 
of toxic substances ensure that cwms toxic waste storage and 
treatment facility poses the least possible risk to human health 
and safety 
the appeals court also rejected arguments that the constitution 
and federal laws guarantee alabama citizens and officials the 
opportunity to express opposition to such shipments before they 
take place 
the bush administration supported the appeals court ruling 
justice department lawyers noted that the superfund law was 
amended in 1986 to bar challenges to cleanup decisions until after 
the cleanup is completed 
the law does not preclude challenges such as the one made by 
the alabama officials the government said it only delays them 
until after remedial action has been taken and thus the law is 
clearly constitutional

the supreme court today agreed to hear 
arguments favoring states rights and consider limiting the federal 
governments power to control water used by hydroelectric dams 
the court said it will hear a california appeal supported by 
more than 40 states 
the waterrights dispute pits the federal energy regulatory 
commission against californias water resources control board the 
bush administration sided with the federal commission and 
environmentalists supported the state agency 
the commission in 1983 licensed construction of a hydroelectric 
power project on rock creek a small tributary of the american 
river near placerville calif 
the dams owner rock creek limited partnership plans to 
generate electric power and sell it to pacific gas amp electric co 
the state water resources agency sought to limit the flow of 
water over the dam by requiring that enough water continue flowing 
in rock creek to assure survival of trout 
but the federal commission in 1987 said it has exclusive control 
over how much water should flow over the dam 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled in favor of 
commission last june saying the federal power act strongly 
suggests that congress intended to vest final authority for the 
regulation of hyrdroelectric power projects in federal hands 
the appeals court said that interpretation of the law is 
supported by a 1946 supreme court ruling which it said gave states 
control over water distribution only for limited purposes for 
irrigation and city water supplies 
congress intended federal law to preempt state regulation in 
all aspects of hydropower projects save for the limited proprietary 
exceptions specified in the law the appeals court said 
permitting the state to limit water supplied to the dam could 
jeopardize the economic feasibility of the project and undermine 
the federal licensing authority the 9th circuit court added 
californias appeal was supported by a friendofthecourt legal 
brief signed by the attorneys general of 43 other states the only 
states not signing were maryland new york virginia louisiana 
ohio and wisconsin 
the 43 states said the appeals court ruling if adopted 
nationwide would fundamentally alter state control of water 
resources and eviscerate comprehensive state regulatory systems for 
allocating water 
leading environmental groups including the national audubon 
society and the sierra club said illconceived hyrdroelectric 
development should not be shielded from state regulation 
but administration lawyers urged the justices to reject any call 
for what they said would be unworkable dual control over 
hydroelectric projects

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that women in a kentucky prison must receive a lawyers help with 
their appeals 
the justices without comment rejected an appeal by officials 
at the kentucky correctional institution for women who were ordered 
to provide the equivalent of at least one halftime lawyer to 
assist inmates 
one of the issues the appeal raised was whether courts without 
finding past intentional sex bias may order prison systems to 
offer female inmates the same access to courts male inmates receive 
inmates at the womens prison in peewee valley ky sued over 
conditions there in 1980 
the suit alleged among other things that the inmates did not 
have adequate access to courts because the law library was inferior 
to those available to male inmates at the kentucky state 
penitentiary and the kentucky state reformatory 
after a fourweek trial in 1982 us district judge edward h 
johnstone in louisville ruled that the state had violated female 
inmates equalprotection rights by not providing them with the 
same court access as male inmates 
he ordered state authorities to provide a library identical to 
those at the two prisons for men to increase the hours women could 
use their prison library and to provide free legal help 
only that part of johnstones order calling for legal help was 
appealed it was upheld by the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
last april 10 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the prison officials 
argued that the hiring of a parttime lawyer should not be required 
there is no justification the appeal said there is no 
formula to measure the success of this parttime attorney 
there are no limits to the assistance provided by counsel 
the appeal was supported in a friendofthecourt brief 
submitted by 13 states they are arizona arkansas florida idaho 
iowa kansas michigan missouri new jersey ohio south dakota

that decision after the justices themselves handed down a similar 
ruling in a minnesota telephone rates case 
the high court said the rico act can apply to even a single 
fraudulent scheme that has the threat of continuing illegal 
activities the justices said the law may be invoked against 
business fraud not only traditional forms of organized crime 
after reexamining the parkchester case the 2nd circuit court 
in september reaffirmed its original ruling and permitted the suit 
the suit is separate from a federal tax evasion criminal case 
that resulted in the conviction of helmsleys wife leona 
harry helmsley was found incompetent to stand trial on the 
criminal charges in that case because of memory loss and reasoning 
problems caused by several slight strokes 
the case acted on today is helmsley vs beauford 89572

the supreme court today refused to protect 
alabama car dealers from being sued by customers who say they were 
sold a lemon 
the court over two dissenting votes let stand an alabama 
supreme court ruling that such car buyers can sue even if they 
signed contracts saying all disputes will be referred to binding 
arbitration 
justices byron r white and harry a blackmun voted to hear 
arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such 
review 
jack and juanita warren residents of st clair county ala 
sued a birmingham car dealership jim skinner ford inc in 1987 
after experiencing what they said were numerous problems with the 
new car they had bought three months before 
the sales contract the warrens had signed called for binding 
arbitration of any dispute 
jim skinner ford immediately sought to freeze the lawsuit until 
arbitration was completed contending such action was required 
under the federal arbitration act 
in past decisions the nations highest court has ruled that the 
federal law precludes a state court proceeding over an alleged 
breach of contract if the disputed contract affected interstate 
commerce and contained an arbitration clause 
a state trial judge granted the dealerships request but last 
july 7 the alabama supreme court ruled that the federal law did not 
require freezing the warrens lawsuit 
the state court said the sale of a car by an alabama dealer to 
alabama residents is not covered by the federal arbitration law 
because the two contracting parties did not comtemplate 
substantial interstate activity 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for jim skinner ford 
argued that congress never intended the federal law to be so 
narrowly confined 
the appeal was supported in a friendofthecourt brief 
submitted by two associations representing over 1000 car 
dealerships in alabama they said the state supreme court ruling 
deprives car dealers of their right to enforce arbitration 
agreements 
lawyers for the warrens urged the justices to reject the appeal 
they said the federal arbitration laws provisions never were 
intended to apply to contracts involving the consumer purchase 
of a product by a citizen of one state from a retailer residing in 
the same state 
the case is jim skinner ford vs warren 89567

senate leaders are pledging support for 
liberalized trade with the soviet union in response to the malta 
summit but some members urge caution against speededup arms 
control talks 
senate armed services committee chairman sen sam nunn dga 
called the weekend meeting a successful and constructive summit 
but warned of pressure that it might exert on ongoing 
weaponsreduction negotiations 
theres nothing wrong with the leaders giving a push to the 
arms control negotiators but there would be danger here if we 
pushed them so hard and so fast that we get a bad agreement rather 
than one that will stand the test of time nunn said on cbstvs 
face the nation 
president bush and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev ended 
their twoday summit on sunday hailing a new era of eastwest 
peace both leaders said they would meet again in june in the 
united states with the possibility of agreements in 1990 to cut 
longrange nuclear weapons and conventional forces as well as 
progress toward a chemical weapons ban 
nunn proposed that the superpower leaders set up teams to 
discuss longrange cutbacks beyond agreements currently being 
negotiated 
conceptual discussions now should not have to wait the 
details nunn said adding but neither should we start 
negotiating new things which would even further delay the existing 
negotiations 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas also expressed 
concern that bush and gorbachev might be putting too much pressure 
on arms control negotiators to reach agreements 
im a little bit concerned about trying to put a deadline on 
any arms control negotiations said dole adding i hope that 
wasnt done he said he needed more details of the summit talks 
before making a final assessment 
dole interviewed on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
said the summit put bush back in the global arena hes providing 
leadership and thats good for all of us 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called the 
first bushgorbachev summit a successful meeting which should 
lead to both weapons reductions and a better economic relationship 
with the soviet union 
mitchell also interviewed on abc said he supports most 
favored nation trade status for the soviet union but said it 
would not likely produce any significant increase in sales of 
sovietmade goods in this country 
theyve got some things to sell but not much that americans or 
other countries will want to buy mitchell said 
the administration has promised to give moscow increased 
benefits and to support its bid to participate in the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade an international trading 
organization in exchange for soviet relaxation of emigration 
restrictions on soviet jews 
rep lee hamilton dind interviewed on cnns sunday 
today said he expects bush to have more trouble with republicans 
than democrats in getting ratification of treaties with the soviets 
he said congress likely would repeal laws that restrict trade 
with the soviet union 
i think the congress is ready and prepared to support that so 
long as the soviet performance on immigration remains good which 
it has been in recent months hamilton said 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said the events in eastern europe upstaged the summit 
reaffirming the fact that the two most powerful countries in the 
world dont make all the key decisions about the world 
aspin in a statement also called the twoday superpower session 
a potatoes summit the meaty summit will come next summer 
the potatoes summit is important nonetheless said aspin 
who hailed the unprecedented joint bushgorbachev news conference 
for making it clear that our differences have not disappeared 
and we can cope with them in a civilized manner that is to say in 
a political rather than a military way

the supreme court today rejected a plea for 
intervention from dekalb county ga school officials who have 
been ordered to consider racial desegregation measures that include 
busing 
the court refused to block a ruling that the countys school 
officials take further steps to integrate the 73000student school 
system the largest in georgia 
justice anthony m kennedy on nov 22 temporarily blocked 
enforcement of a desegregation ruling by the 11th us court of 
appeals to give him more time to study the countys emergency plea 
he then referred the case to the full court 
the county in suburban atlanta has been under court order to 
desegregate its schools since 1969 
us district judge william c okelley ruled last year that the 
county had done all it could to integrate its schools agreeing 
with officials that housing patterns were the primary cause of any 
remaining racial segregation in public schools 
that decision was overturned last october by the 11th circuit 
court which said officials must consider pairing and 
clustering schools in different parts of the county to attain 
racial balance a move that would require busing 
school officials said the appeals court ruling sounded a death 
knell for neighborhood schools in georgia alabama and florida 
the three states encompassed by the 11th circuit 
the school officials cited a 1976 supreme court ruling in a case 
from pasadena calif which they said means a school district 
already under a desegregation order may not be forced to correct 
racial imbalances in student population unless found responsible 
for creating those imbalances 
the case is freeman vs pitts a401

and highrises fired on government troops in the makati financial 
district today refusing to end a 4dayold mutiny and trapping 
hundreds of people in homes and hotel rooms 
a rebel spokesman said the trapped foreigners would be freed 
tuesday but he said this did not mean the mutineers were giving up 
their fight to oust president corazon aquino 
we pledged our lives to this cause we will hold the line to 
the last drop of our blood said the spokesman capt alfred yen 
two bombs exploded in the city injuring two people it was 
unclear if they were related to the coup attempt which began 
friday and has killed at least 70 people 
hundreds of americans and other foreigners were pinned down in 
homes and hotels in the post makati district where forces loyal to 
mrs aquino contained the mutineers to 22 buildings 
rebels shot at anyone venturing outside 
literally were in the middle said barbara julich a new 
york businesswoman trapped in the intercontinental hotel were 
now low on food there are babies in the building and there is no 
baby food and the mothers are hysterical 
we saw were a group of nuns trying to walk where the tanks 
are they were eventually shot at and took cover 
at least three people were reported slain in makati today and 15 
wounded including one american by rebel snipers and in fighting 
between rebel and loyalist forces 
earlier spokesmen for the makati medical center said 10 people 
were killed they said the discrepancy was due to an error in 
records 
government troops forced the surrender of more than 600 rebels 
sunday and defense secretary fidel ramos said the coup attempt had 
been crushed but that it would take several days to complete 
mopping up operations 
this is the sixth and most serious coup attempt against mrs 
aquino 
insurgents seized makati on saturday trading fire with 
government troops and sending bystanders racing for cover 
government forces appeared reluctant to attack for fear of killing 
foreigners 
us embassy spokesman jerry huchel said about 215 americans 
were believed trapped in three hotels in the wealthy district an 
undetermined number of others were believed trapped in luxury 
apartments 
hospital sources identified the american wounded as jerome 
weissburg who they said was hit in the arm by glass when a bullet 
shattered the window of his room at the peninsula hotel they did 
not know his hometown 
yen telephoned news organizations in manila and said foreigners 
would be free to leave hotels at 10 am tuesday 9 pm est 
monday to dispel any ideas they were held hostage 
the foreigners will be taken to manilas airport aboard shuttle 
buses yen said 
at least 70 people have been killed and more than 500 wounded 
since mutineers seized several military installations and bombed 
the presidential palace friday according to the red cross 
us f4 phantom jets flew air cover for counterattacking 
loyalist forces later that day 
on sunday loyalist troops fought off a furious attack by the 
rebels on the military headquarters at camp aguinaldo and about 
600 mutineers surrendered

to surrender and fired at soldiers and civilians who approached 
their strongholds 
the mutinous soldiers claim mrs aquino swept to power in a 
1986 militarycivilian uprising that ousted president ferdinand 
marcos has failed to deal effectively with the countrys communist 
insurgency and economic problems 
one of the coup leaders was gregorio gringo honasan a 
cashiered lieutenant colonel who once supported mrs aquino but 
later led an august 1987 attempt to overthrow her he remained at

state attorney general anthony celebrezze 
jr a leading contender for the democratic gubernatorial 
nomination announced a shift in his position on abortion angering 
antiabortion activists 
celebrezze who had voiced a strong antiabortion position since 
entering the state senate in 1975 told reporters saturday he 
supports public funding of abortions for lowincome women and would 
veto legislation to ban abortion 
celebrezze said he now believes women should have the right to 
choose abortion until the fetus is determined to be viable at 
which point the rights of the fetus become paramount 
the switch comes amid growing evidence that a strong 
antiabortion stance can be a political liability abortion played 
a prominent role in the recent gubernatorial races in virginia and 
new jersey and prochoice candidates won both elections 
celebrezze was expected to announce his candidacy later this 
month for the democratic primary to be held in may 
my own beliefs lead me to conclude that abortion is almost 
always the wrong solution to the problem of unwanted pregnancy 
he said public officials however have a special obligation to 
explain what role the government they serve ought to play in the 
abortion decision 
but curt steiner spokesman for republican gubernatorial 
candidate george voinovich who opposes abortion said celebrezze 
cant have it both ways 
i think this is a shocking reversal heres a person who says 
he wants to run on his record then the first thing he does is run 
away from his record he said 
jill l spangler executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league ohio called the announcement good news for 
the celebrezze campaign 
it is perfectly valid to change ones mind especially on 
something as important as this she said

the supreme court today set the stage for a 
significant ruling on the governments power to fine air polluters 
the court agreed to hear an appeal by general motors which 
faces fines of up to 25000 a day for violating federal air 
quality standards at a massachusetts carassembly plant 
the justices will review a ruling that the federal governments 
failure to meet a deadline for approving or rejecting revised state 
pollution controls does not bar it from fining gm 
in other action the court 
agreed to hear arguments favoring states rights and consider 
limiting the federal governments power to control water used by 
hydroelectric dams 
the court said it will hear a california appeal supported by 
nearly every other state 
left intact a ruling that limits the power of states and their 
citizens to block shipments of hazardous waste from other states 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by alabama 
officials who failed to prevent shipments of hazardous waste from 
an abandoned texas chemical refinery to alabama 
agreed to decide whether us banks with branch offices 
overseas must pay depositors after foreign governments seize or 
freeze those accounts 
the court said it will review rulings that required citibank to 
pay depositors lawyers for citibank said billions of dollars are 
at stake there are more than 900 branches of us banks operating 
in 73 countries with some 225 billion in deposits 
rejected a plea from dekalb county ga school officials 
ordered to consider racial desegregation measures that include 
busing 
the court refused to block a ruling that the countys school 
officials take further steps to integrate the 73000student school 
system the largest in georgia 
the air pollution case involves pollution from car paint at gms 
plant in framingham and focuses on the joint federalstate system 
for cleaning up the atmosphere 
under the federal clean air act the us environmental 
protection agency sets national air quality standards the states 
are required to adopt plans to meet those standards and submit the 
plans to the epa 
the federal agency in 1980 approved a massachusetts plan for 
reducing pollution from paint at auto assembly factories 
the plan required car makers to comply fully with the federal 
rules by dec 31 1985 
but epa officials extended the deadline for any plant switching 
from lacquer paints to enamel which emits less pollutants 
gm initially planned to stay with lacquer at the framingham 
factory but in june 1985 announced it would convert to enamel by 
the summer of 1987 the company asked that it not be required to 
comply with the dec 31 1985 standards until 20 months later 
massachusetts officials approved gms proposal and submitted a 
revised plan to the epa on dec 30 1985 
without waiting for federal approval gm began building a 200 
million plant in framingham to use the enamel system while 
continuing to operate its factory that uses lacquer paint 
epa officials went to federal court in august 1987 seeking fines 
of up to 25000 a day against gm for 20 months of airquality 
violations at the old framingham plant 
it was not until september 1988 that the epa rejected the 
stateapproved pollution control system at the new plant 
a federal judge barred the epa from imposing fines against gm 
for violations of the dec 31 1985 standards the judge said the 
federal agency itself violated the clean air act by taking more 
than four months to rule on the stateapproved plan submitted dec 
30 1985 
but the 1st us circuit court of appeals last june said the 
epas failure to meet the fourmonth deadline does not disqualify 
it from fining companies that violate previously approved pollution 
control rules 
the public should not be penalized with dirtier air because of 
what often are unavoidable epa delays the appeals court said 
it told the trial judge to decide how much the fines should be 
stating he should take into account whether the epas delay was 
reasonable and what impact the delay had on gm 
the us chamber of commerce joined gm in urging the supreme 
court to review the air pollution dispute 
chamber of commerce lawyers said the 1st circuit court ruling is 
an incentive to the epa to treat companies unfairly they said it 
conflicts with decisions by other federal appeals courts 
the bush administration said the 1st circuit courts ruling was 
correct 
the case is general motors vs us 89369

retirees will have to continue paying monthly 
premiums for medicare catastrophic coverage at least until may 
even though the program is being repealed this month federal 
officials said today 
that much time will be required to adjust and test the 
government computers that now withhold the premiums from monthly 
social security benefit checks social security commissioner 
gwendolyn king said in an interview today 
she said the social security administration hopes to stop 
deducting the premiums starting with the benefit checks that arrive 
in early may refunds of the premiums could take three or more 
months beyond that date 
the 4amonth premium for catastrophic coverage is scheduled 
under the law to rise to 530 on jan 1 although congress voted 
last month to repeal catastrophic protection the bill has not yet 
been presented to president bush for his signature 
my concern is for those on fixed income who cannot afford to 
see 5 go out of their checks ms king said thats a lot of 
money for those people and it is little consolation for them to 
know they will get a refund in the future 
the prospect of seeing retirees continue to have to pay the 
premiums does not sit well either with sen david pryor dark 
chairman of the senate aging committee 
i fear that a lengthy delay will create a firestorm of 
protest pryor said in a letter to ms king that was made public 
today we must recognize the impending firestorm and move repidly 
to alleviate the problem 
pryor said many retirees will need the 530 a month to pay the 
expected increase in rates for private medigap policies as a 
result of repeal of federal coverage 
catastrophic coverage was enacted last year to protect people 65 
and older from being bankrupted by a major illness the program 
fell into disfavor with many retirees especially those who already 
have private coverage and higherincome people who were faced with 
an income surtax of up to 800 a year for catastrophic 
as a result of loud complaints from those groups congress 
agreed last month to kill the program 
the monthly premiums that have been deducted from benefit checks 
this year will not be refunded they will pay for hospital and 
other benefits that have been in effect all year 
few retirees have been paying the surtax those who have paid it 
through quarterly estimated tax payments will get a 
largerthanexpected income tax refund next year

president bush said monday that west german 
chancellor helmut kohl appeared comfortable with the us 
insistence that any moves to german reunfication be gradual 
bush said soviet president mikhail gorbachev voiced concern at 
their summit meeting over the weekend that outside forces would try 
to impose an artificial deadline for german reunification 
at a news conference after he presented a summit briefing to 
members of the north atlantic treaty organization bush reiterated 
the fourpoint us position on reunification 
it must be pursued based on selfdetermination of the people of 
east and west germany without anyone trying to dictate in advance 
what form unification would take 
unification must be pursued in the context of germanys 
continued commitment to nato and the european community 
moves toward unification should be peaceful gradual and 
part of a stepbystep process 
the helsinki accord respecting the borders in europe should be 
observed and changes should be made only peacefully 
i think chancellor kohl feels comfortable with the four things 
i just said bush added 
the first three points are similar to some of the 10 points 
outlined recently by kohl in his plan for moving toward 
reunification 
bush was asked about his insistence that a unified germany 
remain committed to nato by contrast gorbachev contends the 
division of germany was dictated by history and that east germany 
should remain part of the sovietled warsaw pact 
i think his view was one of caution bush said i 
really believe that i think he recognized the rapidity of change 
he has very constructively talked about peaceful change 
i think he feels that if there were outside forces setting 
dates that would complicate the way he is helping manage the change 
in the pact bush added

following is the text of president 
bushs news conference monday following his meeting with nato 
leaders 
president bush i have a statement and then ill be glad to 
respond to your questions 
this year the people of the east made fundamental choices about 
their destiny and governments there began to honor the citizens 
right to choose what these changes amount to is nothing less than 
a peaceful revolution and the task before us therefore is to 
consolidate the fruits of this peaceful revolution and provide the 
architecture for continued peaceful change to end the division of 
europe and of germany to make europe whole and free 
great choices are being made greater opportunities beckon the 
political strategy for nato that we agreed upon last may makes the 
promotion of greater freedom in the east a basic element of 
alliance policy accordingly nato should promote human rights 
democracy and reform within eastern countries as the best means of 
encouraging reconciliation among the countries of eastern and 
western europe 
although this is a time of great hope and it is we must not 
blur the distinction between promising expectations and present 
realities we must remain constant with natos traditional security 
mission i pledged today that the united states will maintain 
significant military forces in europe as long as our allies desire 
our presence as part of a common defense effort the us will 
remain a european power and that means that the united states will 
stay engaged in the future of europe and in our common defense 
many of the values that should guide europes future are described 
in the final act of the conference on security and cooperation in 
europe these values encompass the freedom of people to choose 
their destiny under a rule of law with rulers who are 
democratically accountable 
i think we can look to the csce to play a greater role in the 
future of europe the 35 nations of the csce bridge both the 
division of europe and the atlantic ocean its a structure that 
should be able to contribute much to the future architecture of 
europe 
i also appreciate the vital role that the ec must play in the 
new europe and its my belief that the events of our times call 
both for a continued perhaps even intensified effort of the 12 to 
integrate and a role for the ec as a magnet that draws the forces 
of reform toward eastern europe and thats why i was exceptionally 
pleased that we agreed at the paris economic summit on a specific 
role for the ec in that group of 24 effort to assist poland and 
hungary 
we stand on the threshold of a new era and we know that we are 
contributing to a process of history driven by the peoples 
determined to be free the people of europe especially the brave 
citizens of the east are illuminating the future and yet the 
outcome is not predestined it depends on our continued strength 
and our solidarity as an alliance our transatlantic partnership 
can create the architecture of a new era and a new atlanticism 
where selfdetermination and individual freedom everywhere replace 
coercion and tyranny where economic freedom everywhere replaces 
economic controls and stagnation and where lasting peace is 
reinforced everywhere by common respect for the rights of man 
i now would be glad to respond to some questions and weve got 
to be out of here in about a little after quarter of 
q mr president i have a twopart question youve made it 
clear that you are going stay in europe but in view of the 
dramatic reduction in tensions and the obvious weakening of the 
warsaw pact what will be the real american role and two will 
there now be more money for the poor and the homeless public 
housing the nation is really badly in need of repair of 
infrastructure 
a we have a lot of demands at home and theres no question 
about that but i think it is premature to speak as some are at 
home about a peace dividend take a lot of money out of 
defense and put it into other worthy causes and so i i as i 
started over the budget figures for the next budget cycle we are 
under a tremendous burden to get our total spending down in order 
to meet the grammrudman and the grammrudman targets in terms of 
the us role i think i set it out here pretty well we will 
continue to play a very active role in nato i see nothing that 
diminishes the importance of the united states and i might say 
that i gathered from our interlocutors there the other heads of 
state and government that they want us fully involved and i i 
thinking back on my talk with mr gorbachev i dont see any 
conflict there either 
q mr president vernon walters your trusted adviser and the 
ambassador to bonn said that he envisions a said that germany 
east and west will be reunited withint five years do you think 
thats possible and what would be the implications for nato and 
the warsaw pact 
a i am not into the predicting of time on the question of 
germany let me just i dont know whether the secretary general 
read you these points let me just read the four points that 
represent the us position on reunification

brussels on reunification 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
selfdetermination must be pursued without prejudice to its 
outcome and we should not at this time endorse any particular 
vision secondly unification should occur in the context of 
germanys continued commitment to nato an increasingly integrated 
european community and with due regard for the legal role and 
responsibilities of the allied powers third in the interest of 
general european stability moves toward unification must be 
peaceful gradual and part of a stepbystep basis and these were 
and lastly on the question of borders we should reiterate our 
support for the principles of the helsinki final act 
so i am not trying to accelerate that process i dont think 
our allies are i think chancellor kohl feels comfortable with the 
four points i have just read and so i think its better to let 
things move on their own and without the united states certainly 
setting some kind of deadline 
q mr president you said in announcing your meeting with 
chairman gorbachev that one of the main reasons was that you 
wanted to make sure that in this time of change you didnt miss 
anything in your two days of meetings did you learn anything that 
you fear or feel that you might have missed had you not had this 
a yes what i would have missed is i wouldnt see quite as 
clearly his priorities i see them more clearly because he and i 
sat down and talked we had about eight hours of talks some 
private and i feel i can sense much more clearly the things he 
feels more strongly about and we had a good chance to point out to 
him some of the difficulties with our relationship it wasnt all 
sweetness and light i had a very very good opportunity to tell 
him how we view the our problems in our own hemisphere the 
sending of arms in there to help the fmln and the role that 
unhelpful role that cuba is playing 
i recited in detail the oscar arias phone call to me please 
raise with mr gorbachev the unhelpful role the destructive role 
of cuba so i think its more emphasis although we did put 
forward some general themes on the economy and i think he was 
pleased because i think from his standpoint and this is 
important from mine he now sees that we want to have a 
cooperative forwardleaning relationship with the soviet union 
q mr president you have perhaps more than any contemporary 
american president exercised personal diplomacy establishing 
personal friendships with a wide variety of leaders are you 
prepared now to say that mr gorbachev is your friend 
a ill say this we had a very friendly conversations and 
then once in a while there were a little tension there but it 
was extraordinarily friendly in the conversation aspect i dont 
know how you go further than that in definition but im convinced 
that he is determined to do thats what that what he told me hes 
doing reform perestroika openness we totally agree on is a 
democratic value so brit what happened was i think he took my 
measure and i took his and i think we just feel more comfortable 
about our common objectives 
yeah john 
q i want to go back to what helen asked you about you said 
that you had made an atlantic policy 
a keep talking im just going to get some water 
q after world war ii the europeans needed our money for the 
marshall plan then they needed our military backing because of the 
soviet threat but now if the soviet military is a question that 
one of your successors will have to deal with eventually what are 
they going to need from us what role do we really have to play 
here we dont live on this continent 
a well we have a tremendous interaction if you want to 
hypothetically project that that guaranteed peaceful time i 
would say interaction with the united states on student exchanges 
cultural exchanges economic matters i mean theres a tremendous 
potential for a soviet union that is in accord with us on these 
democratic values its a tremendous market for example but it 
needs the economic reform so what weve got to do is be sure that 
we conduct ourselves in such a way that the changes the political 
reforms can keep going forward there in eastern europe that they 
can that the soviet union can do what mr gorbachev is trying to 
do internally and then theres just enormous potential for living 
at peace with that tremendous power 
q sir maybe i misstated my question what i really mean is 
what why do west europeans need us once the military threat 
recedes the west europeans why would there have to be a nato 
this is a political and military alliance and its really only a 
political alliance because of the military need 
a you mean would why will there always have to be a us 
presence 
q why will there always have to be a nato 
a well im not sure im if you want to project out 100 
years or 
q well no 
a take some take some years off of that you can look to a 
utopian day when there might not be but as i pointed out to them 
that day hasnt arrived and they agree with me and so the united 
states must stay involved what we dont want to do is send the 
signal of decoupling the decoupling of the united states and 
canada from nato particularly at this highly sensitive time and 
mr gorbachev understood that he made that point to me 
yes 
q did president gorbachev ask your forebearance in case he 
decided to crack down on dissidents and if so what did you say 
or what role did the question of ethnic and baltic dissent have in 
your meeting 
a the answer to the first part is no and the answer to the 
second part is i asked him to describe for me the problems inside 
the nationality problems inside the soviet union and he did it in 
considerable detail 
yeah

the environmental protection agency today 
called for sharp curbs on the widely used ebdc family of 
pesticides proposing that the chemical no longer be applied to 42 
crops including apples and tomatoes because of concerns about 
cancer 
the proposed regulation which would not become final until 
early 1991 would allow the continued use of the ebdc fungicides on 
10 crops including grapes onion and cranberries 
the epa said the use of the ebdcs known as maneb mancozeb and 
metiram on the remaining 10 crops do not present an 
unreasonable risk the agency estimated the maximum risk of 
someone getting cancer from a lifetime of exposure at three in 1 
million with the chemicals current widespread use that risk is 4 
in 10000 it said 
epa administrator william reilly applauded a decision announced 
earlier this year by ebdc manufacturers to withdraw the chemicals 
use on 42 crops but he said we do not believe that goes far 
enough and proposed that the ban apply as well to three 
additional crops tomatoes bananas and potatoes 
the manufacturers have said they would begin their voluntary 
curbs at the end of the year ebdc use on the other three crops 
would not go into effect for at least 18 months unless producers 
choose to incorporate them in their voluntary curb 
the ebdc chemicals which began to be used in the 1930s are 
among the most widely used fungicides with as much as 18 million 
pounds manufactured annually for use on most common vegetables as 
well as grains 
but the fungicide has come under attack from environmentalists 
and health specialists because a breakdown product called etu has 
been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals chronic exposure 
also raises the risks of birth defects or thyroid disorders 
scientists said 
the epa said that while the health risks associated with ebdc 
use on any one crop may be negligible the cumulative risks 
associated with its widespread use has been determined to be 
unreasonable 
the health risk estimates are based on the maximum allowable 
dosage of the fungicide on various crops the epa said those 
estimates likely are greater than residue levels found in the 
marketplace because the fungicide is easily washed off 
crop producers as well as state agriculture departments had 
asked the epa to hold off proposing restrictions on the ebdcs until 
a marketbasket survey currently under way is completed to provide a 
clearer picture of residue levels actually found on crops by 
consumers 
the national association of state departments of agriculture 
said in a letter to reilly that several states already had reported 
results of surveys and to date no significant residues of ebdcs 
have been found 
environmental groups however have criticized the epa for 
moving too slowely in getting the ebdcs off the market noting that 
a final regulation on the chemical will not be issued until the 
spring of 1991 
under the epa proposal ebdcs would continue to be used on 
grapes wheat cranberries onions sugar beets sweet corn 
peanuts almonds asparagus and figs 
the 42 crops on which ebdcs currently are used but would no 
longer be used under voluntary curbs by the chemicals 
manufacturers are 
apples apricots barley casaba melons crenshaw melons 
cucumbers eggplants endives lettuce pineapples pumpkins green 
beans dried beans lima beans broccoli brussels sprouts 
cabbage cantaloupes carrots cauliflower celery collards field 
corn cotton crabapples fennel honeydew melons kale kohlrabi 
mustard greens nectarines oats papayas peaches pears pecans 
peppers rhubarb rye squash spinach turnips and watermelon

a 26yearold woman has a new heart liver 
and kidney after an almost daylong operation that doctors called 
the first of its kind 
cindy martin of archbald remained in critical condition today at 
presbyterianuniversity hospital which is normal after transplant 
surgery 
at a news conference this morning doctors said they would try 
to begin weaning her off a respirator today 
other multiorgan transplants have been performed but this was 
the first involving the heart liver and a kidney said transplant 
pioneer dr thomas starzl director of the university of 
pittsburghs transplant program 
the procedure began at 735 pm saturday and ended at 5 pm 
sunday 
it was ms martins second heart transplant she has familial 
cardiomyopathy an inherited heart disease according to the 
hospital 
mrs martins family has a history of congenital heart problems 
her father died when he was 31 and many relatives on his side of 
the family also have died young her husband john martin 28 said 
today 
mrs martin suffered from chronic rejection of the heart she 
received in her first transplant three years ago and had developed 
hepatitis and kidney dysfunction kidney dysfunction can affect 
patients taking the antirejection drug cyclosporine 
doctors will treat mrs martin with the japanese drug fk506 
which is believed 50 to 100 times more effective than cyclosporine 
hospital spokeswoman lisa rossi said fk506 has been tested since 
february in pittsburgh on liver heart kidney pancreas and lung 
recipients 
the new organs came from an atlanta woman in her 20s who was 
killed in a car accident doctors said 
when doctors called saturday to say a donor had been found 
martin said he had to scramble to locate his wife 
we had a tough time finding her at first because she was out 
shopping when the call came martin said im nervous of 
course the first transplant sort of prepared me a little for this 
but im just nervous as to what the outcome might be 
her operation came five days after another milestone in 
transplant operations in chicago 21monthold alyssa smith became 
the nations first person to receive part of a liver from a living 
donor alyssa was listed in serious condition sunday and is 
improving steadily said john easton a spokesman for the 
university of chicagos wyler childrens hospital alyssas mother 
teresa was the donor 
the worlds first survivor of a heartliver transplant was 
stormie jones now 12 of white settlement texas starzl conducted 
that procedure on feb 14 1984 at childrens hospital of 
pittsburgh 
two other heartliver transplants were performed the next year 
in pittsburgh but both patients died with a few days of surgery 
starzl also has headed multipleorgan transplant operations 
involving the intestines 
tabatha foster 3 of madisonville ky survived six months 
before dying in may 1988 after a multipleorgan transplant 
rolandrea dodge 3 of fruitland nm died last january six 
weeks after surgery 
starzl also has headed multipleorgan transplants on adults with 
malignant inoperable tumors in the pancreas and liver areas 
in those cases surgeons have removed the patients liver 
pancreas most or all of the stomach twothirds of the colon and 
duodenum a 10inchlong section of the small intestine the cavity 
has been filled with a block of organs consisting of the liver 
pancreas duodenum and jejunum a few feet of section of the small 
intestine

hundreds of thousands of people 
chanting resign resign rallied in the nations two biggest 
cities today to protest the new communistdominated government and 
demand a new one be named by the weekend 
waving red white and blue national flags a crowd in pragues 
wenceslas square cheered opposition calls for a general strike dec 
11 if there is no new government by sunday 
boos and derisive whistles greeted the mention of old communist 
party leaders responsible for 21 years of hardline policy 
in the nations secondlargest city bratislava tens of 
thousands gathered in central namestie square despite the numbing 
cold to vent their anger they chanted resign and shame 
shame as speaker after speaker accused premier ladislav adamec 
of ignoring the will of the people 
civic forum the largest opposition movement demanded elections 
by july a group spokesman vaclav maly said the opposition hoped 
to field its own candidates 
thanks for your help and support maly shouted to the crowd 
in prague we need it now more than ever 
it was the first protest in prague since civic forum staged a 
general strike a week ago that strike observed by millions led 
adamec to agree to relinquish the communists 41year monopoly on 
power 
but the new 21member cabinet named sunday contained only five 
noncommunists and communists retained all the key ministries 
we want a happy christmas christmas with a new government 
read a poster near civic forums prague headquarters today an 
old play with a new cast warned another poster on the same 
window 
the turnouts at the rallies were clear signals to the government 
that the opposition can still draw popular support to back its 
demands for democracy 
long live havel protesters shouted to welcome playwright 
vaclav havel the countrys most prominent dissident to wenceslas 
square the rally was reported live on state radio and television 
state radio estimated the crowd at 200000 but western 
reporters put it at about 150000 
we feel disappointed and cheated said michal sedlacek a 
representative of striking students who decided to prolong their 
twoweek sitin at campuses across the country in protest of the 
new government 
the government doesnt understand the situation fully 
sedlacek told the cheering crowd we want other changes 
with this government the leading role of the communist party 
was assured said another speaker director miroslav machocek 
in fact the leading role has been abolished in the 
constitution but with this government it exists again he added 
machocek said artists theaters and galleries will go on strike 
until dec 11 
actor milan knazko a key slovak republic figure in the popular 
uprising said no rally had been planned in bratislava but the 
government had sent us this invitation to demonstrate by ignoring 
the people 
the new government appeared an attempt by the ruling communists 
to buy time and get reform going at a pace they dictate rather 
than the hectic tempo forced by the mass demonstrations last month 
wenceslas square was the focal point of 11 days of mass 
prodemocracy demonstrations that forced a number of concessions 
from the communists last week including the promise of free 
elections and the removal of the partys monopoly on power 
adamec has so far made no specific mention of free elections 
one of the concessions was the lifting of travel restrictions 
today 
czechoslovaks were still required however to have a visa from 
most western countries they wished to visit with only austria 
lifting visa requirements 
border guards reported that fewer than 3000 czechoslovaks 
crossed today into austria most were just visiting lacking enough 
money to stay permanently unlike east germans going to west 
germany czechoslovaks did not receive any welcome money in 
austria 
the relatively light turnout compared with the flood that 
poured out of east germany when its borders were opened nov 9 was 
due in part to the fact that today was a workday also most 
czechoslovaks do not have much hard currency and the countrys 
travel restrictions had not been as stringent as other east bloc 
countries 
the opposition saw another of its demands met with the 
announcement on the state news agency ctk that it would be given a 
building that had belonged to the czechoslovaksoviet friendship 
society to use as its prague headquarters 
until now civic forum has been operating from the striking 
laterna magika theater 
the new government includes three people without party 
affiliation and one each from the socialist and peoples parties 
which have traditionally been docile communist allies but have 
become more independent in recent months 
deputy defense minister colgen miroslav vacek moved up to 
take over the defense ministry and frantisek pinc a politically 
unknown communist who last served as director of a nuclear power 
station got the interior ministry 
the official ctk news agency said 11 of the 17 cabinet ministers 
in the czech republic had submitted their resignations including 
the unpopular ministers of education and justice

q mr president you had mentioned that you got some insight 
into president gorbachev at this summit i wonder if the insight 
included any sense of his internal position did he behave as if a 
man operating from a strong position a man who seems to be in 
jeopardy or how do you feel about that 
a i though he seemed very much in control you can tell the way 
that he interacted with his own top people there and he felt very 
confident in discussing without notes a wide array of subjects 
with me he did have a little notebook that he referred to it was 
written in his own handwriting the best i could see and once 
having seen it i couldnt read it and so he seemed in control 
he seemed subdued is the wrong word but i would say 
determined and unemotional about it the most emotion we saw was at 
that press conference yesterday but it was a wonderful 
presentation and the climate for leave out the weather the 
climate for the discussions was really good 
yes margaret 
q mr president again as part of the insight you gained what 
is your understanding about secretary general gorbachevs view of 
the unification of germany do you think hes as opposed as hes 
said in public or do you think that he accepts the fact that 
a i think his view was one of if i could use a word thats 
unfamiliar to many caution and i really believe that i think he 
recognizes the rapidity of change he has very constructively 
talked about peaceful change and i dont i think his hope is 
that people dont try to set up some artificial calendar by which 
date by which that reunification should happen and i think he 
feels that if there were outside forces setting dates on something 
like that that would complicate the way in which he is managing 
the change and helping manage the change in the pact 
yeah two charles and then lesley 
q mr president there was a lot of speculation going in that 
you and mr gorbachev might get involved in talking about deeper 
cuts particularly in european forces did you in fact do that 
and is there skepticism within this organization here about moving 
too rapidly beyond what has now been dubbed cfe 1 
a no we didnt get into that we talked very broadly about our 
aspirations for further arms control but there was no emphasis on 
that and i there may be some strains in one country or another 
viewing the rapidity of change differently than we do but what i 
suggested to our nato allies is lets go forward with the 
agreements weve got out there the cfe lets get it done 
i the president of the united states will kick our bureaucracy 
and push it as fast as i possibly we can ive talked to general 
galvin i had a meeting with him over here last night and im 
convinced that we i must do more to keep it on schedule and ive 
encouraged the other allies to do the same i dont think there was 
any resistance to that similarly start and chemical weapons 
so before we go into a wide array of other questions i think 
the best thing to do is take advantage of the moment and move 
forward in those three areas and i we went i went over that in 
little talks with individuals from nato as well as in the meeting 
itself 
lesley 
q but do you accept the principle of a cfe 2 
a well id like to get a cfe 1 in the bank first get it 
locked up get those troops out move down to equal levels us 
and soviet forces and so we ought to we ought to manage that 
before we start the architecure of something else i want to see 
that done on time 
lesley 
q mr president on east germany as you know the party 
structure the communist party structure has collapsed there its 
unclear whos running the government i wonder if you talked about 
that if you personally think that its a dangerous situation if 
that moves unification up in the timetable at all and secondly 
what gorbachev said to you when you said to him unification of 
germany would have to be in the nato context 
a no i dont think its a dangerous situation i dont think 
anybody here in this room including myself has been able to 
predict the rapidity of the change the totality of the change but 
i dont see it as dangerous as long as the soviet leader and the 
germans and the west conduct themselves the way ive been been 
urging 
what was the second part 
q well what mr gorabachev said to you when you said 
unification but only in the nato context i mean he keeps saying 
it has to be in the warsaw pact context 
a no we we we were i dont think we went into that in 
real depth lesley 
q well what do you think he thinks about it i mean 
obviously 
a well thats too hypothetical i got trouble figuring it out 
on our side with all our experts rather than knowing what i think 
he might think about something he hasnt thought about maybe 
yes tom 
q mr president mr president you seem to have traveled some 
distance between what you were saying about mr gorbachev a year or 
so ago and some of the things you said yesterday could you please 
talk in a little bit more detail about the evolution in your 
thinking that you mentioned yesterday how that happened and what 
persuaded you along the way 
a as i watched the way in which mr gorbachev has handled the 
changes in eastern europe it deserves new thinking it absolutely 
mandates new thinking and when i see his willingness to give 
support to a cfe agreement that calls for him to disproportionately 
reduce his forces and that is there on the table i think that 
mandates new thinking when i hear him talk about peaceful change 
and the right of countries to choose countries in the warsaw pact 
to choose that deserves new thinking and so i approach this 
and i think in step with our allies with a certain respect for 
what hes doing and thus we want to try to meet him on some of the 
areas where he needs help im thinking of a few suggestions i had 
in the economic area but i also believe that the west must remain 
strong and together and try to be helpful where we can in a united 
way but not be imprudent 
yes maam

a former guard who has had emotional problems 
since he was held hostage during a 1987 riot at the atlanta federal 
prison is suing to get government videotapes his psychologist says 
can help him end his ordeal 
leon mormann 36 was one of about 100 hostages held by cuban 
detainees during the 11day takeover at the penitentiary two years 
ago a number of people held hostage at the atlanta prison and 
during a related prison confrontation at oakdale la have 
reported serious emotional problems 
soon after his release mormann accepted a transfer to a prison 
in tucson ariz where the mostly hispanic prison population 
reminded him of the atlanta prison 
i flipped out he said adding that he suffered a panic 
attack that put him in a psychiatric ward for a month his wife and 
daughter left him and he has since divorced he returned to 
atlanta in july 1988 and lives on workers compensation 
the federal bureau of prisons confirms that tapes of the atlanta 
riot exist but has told mormann he was not specific enough as to 
which ones he wished to see when he tried to get copies through the 
freedom of information act 
he sued in federal court when that effort failed 
how can we be more specific we dont even know whats on the 
tapes said psychologist david aycock of jonesboro who has been 
treating mormann for a year its not like theres a national 
security risk here were just looking for anything that can 
bring him back into the situation 
aycock said the tapes could help mormann realize what he went 
through and help him get on with his life 
he can watch the tapes and be anxious cut it off and go back 
to it when he calms down control is the key aycock said 
aycock said mormann has posttraumatic stress disorder similar 
to that of some war or disaster survivors and suffers nightmares 
and flashbacks 
on the day of the nov 23 1987 takeover aycock was the only 
guard in a dormitory of about 70 cubans considered to be model 
prisoners he locked himself in an office but the inmates broke 
the door down with a desk 
he was handcuffed tied and forced at knifepoint to be a human 
shield for the transfer of two wounded prisoners he was kept 
handcuffed to another guard in a cell for the duration of the 
takeover 
the cubans detained at the atlanta prison were among those who 
came to the united states in the mariel boatlift of 1980 thousands 
who had criminal records or got into trouble after arrival were 
held pending deportation since the riot 122 have been sent back 
to cuba 789 remain in custody and 3250 have been released to 
halfway houses relatives or other sponsors

paint was splashed on doors of four catholic 
churches and a group claiming responsibility said the vandalism 
was retaliation for archbishop roger mahonys opposition to the use 
of condoms to prevent aids 
members of a group calling itself greater religious 
responsibility claimed sunday they had defaced the places of 
worship with bright red paint a color they said symbolizes the 
blood of aids patients 
posters of mahony were glued to the church entrances with 
paraphrased excerpts from his recent policy statement such as 
safe sex is both a lie and a fraud 
calls seeking comment went unanswered at the archbishops office 
and residence this morning 
at st ambrose catholic church in west hollywood vandals 
scrawled the word murderer beneath a photo of the archbishop 
said the rev john a beattie 
a caller to knbctv who said she was a member of the activist 
group said the vandalism will continue until mahony changes his 
anticondom stance another caller told the los angeles times the 
paint also denoted the tragedy of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
someone dies of aids every 20 minutes in this country because 
mahonys policy is allowing that to continue unchecked the 
woman caller said 
mahony was chairman of a committee at the national conference of 
catholic bishops that rejected the use of condoms as a means of 
fighting the spread of aids 
in presenting the policy paper to the bishops mahony declared 
that young people should avoid being trapped into the safesex 
myth which is both a lie and a fraud 
beattie who said at least 30 percent of his congregation is 
gay said he was saddened by the act of vandalism and believed the 
archbishops policy has been misinterpreted 
st ambrose has done a lot to reach out to the gay community 
and why we should be singled out is a matter of confusion he 
said the tenor of the archbishops statement is one of 
compassion for those with aids and of compassion for gays and 
lesbians

pop stars finished a new version of the 1984 hit 
song do they know its christmas early monday to raise money 
for african famine victims 
more than a dozen singers ranging from australian teen idol 
kylie minogue to us veteran tina turner worked into the early 
hours to remake the band aid song that topped the charts in 
christmas 1984 organizers said 
the single is expected to go on sale dec 11 
the original record raised some 10 million for starving 
africans and spawned other projects including the transatlantic 
live aid rock extravaganza on july 13 1985 which brought in more 
than 100 million 
millionaire poprecord producer peter waterman who supervised 
production of the new single at his london studios said he was 
considering organizing live aid ii next year 
first we have to bring the publics attention to the record 
then we will sit down just after christmas and talk about a live 
show he said it would be perfect timing 
waterman lined up the pop stars and groups including cliff 
richard chris rea bananarama bros jason donovan and tears for 
fears after being approached by irish rock singer bob geldof last 
week geldof who conceived the 1984 single said he is keeping a 
backstage role 
the problem in africa is the same the song is the same and 
its the same time of year geldof said the only thing that 
has changed is the faces in english pop music 
british aid workers recently back from ethiopia said monday that 
scores of villagers in the warravaged northern province of tigray 
are dying of hunger they urged britons to dig into their pockets 
to help avert a famine disaster 
there is still time said the rev john parkin of christian 
aid we have about until the end of january before absolute 
crisis hits us 
up to 4 million people in ethiopia are threatened with 
starvation aid agencies say

israels financially strapped collective farm 
movement agreed to an austerity program including meatless meals 
and fewer trips abroad under a government bailout of its 36 
billion debt a spokesman said monday 
the collective farms a symbol of israels socialist pioneers 
also agreed to increase investment in light industry said shimon 
helman spokesman for the united kibbutz movement 
its part of a trend he said we already produce far more 
than the agricultural needs of the state so we are looking for 
profitable exports like winter fruit and flowers to western europe 
and light industry 
kibbutzes were founded at the turn of the century by european 
immigrants who believed hard work on collective farms would build a 
unique israeli character but the movements debts and aging 
population have forced kibbutzes to invest in light industry which 
accounts for half of their profits 
the movement also agreed to sell 20 million in assets 
including property in tel aviv and ordered member farms to serve 
two meatless meals a week as part of a 7 percent cutback in living 
expenses helman said 
under the agreement to be signed this week the government will 
write off 835 million in debts 
it will offer tax breaks to banks to give the collective farms 
25year loans at 45 percent interest to cover the remainder of the 
total debt 
the plan was approved by the united kibbutz movement on sunday 
the smaller kibbutz artzi movement accepted the program three weeks 
ago 
there was a tremendous amount of disagreement over whether to 
accept the government offer helman said it does not address 
our future the building of new kibbutzes the absorption of new 
immigrants or our pension plan 
helman said many kibbutz members blamed the government for 
creating the unfavorable exchange rates and high interest rates 
that devastated kibbutz exports and helped cause the huge debt 
newspaper reports said finance minister shimon peres head of 
the centerleft labor party put pressure on the movement to accept 
the offer 
the movments 164 collective farms are affiliated with labor 
while the kibbutz artzi movements 84 collective farms are linked 
to the socialist mapam party the two groups have 110000 members 
some members said they voted for the plan which passed by a 
30032 vote out of fear kibbutzes could fall under control of the 
rightwing likud bloc in the future likud has accused kibbutzes of 
financial mismanagement and threatened to cut off aid 
but helman said he believed likud also would agree to a bailout 
plan because of the food raised by the kibbutzes and the location 
of many of them along israels borders

the national bank of poland devalued the 
polish zloty by 95 percent monday continuing a drive to create a 
convertible currency that would encourage western economic 
investment 
the new rate is 4200 zlotys to the dollar compared with 3800 
a week ago the zloty was devalued similarly against other western 
currencies 
the devaluation was the eighth since prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki took office in august as the first noncommunist leader 
in the east bloc and initiated a radical reformation of the 
staggering polish economy 
like other currencies in the east bloc the zloty cannot be 
freely exchanged with the hard currencies of the west and has a 
value set by the government not the money market 
poles can legally buy dollars at a less favorable but more 
realistic marketdriven exchange known as the commercial rate 
at about 7000 zlotys to the dollar 
the government seeks to make the official and commercial rates 
converge possibly as soon as jan 1 giving the zloty a 
convertible value that would ensure western companies a way to 
translate profits into other currencies

couldnt 
a lot of people supporting us through hard times were mothers 
but they couldnt come to our banquet said owa brandstein 
quarterback for the team at mohawk trail regional high school 
its blatant discrimination its just wrong 
howard binder a cofounder of friends of mohawk which was to 
sponsor the dec 9 banquet said monday the banquet was canceled 
after the guest list became an issue both from the quarterback and 
women who had approached school committee members 
the reason we went father and son was because the hall we held 
it in wasnt big enough to hold a bigger crowd he said after 
the requests were made to add to the guest list the dinner which 
annually draws about 125 people was canceled he said we just 
didnt feel that we wanted to get that big 
the fatherson banquet has been held since the mohawk team was 
cochampion in 1968 this year the team went 27 
brandsteins parents marcine and stewart eisenberg said they 
supported their son

q mr president you mentioned earlier that there was some 
tension during the meetings and earlier to reporters you had said 
that there was no personal rancor could you outline the moments of 
tension or tell us a little bit about the moments when you felt 
there was tension between you and the soviet leader 
a yeah i think where you dont have agreement you can have 
some some slight tension might result i dont want to imply 
there was great and dramatic moments of tension please if i let 
me clarify it if thats the impression i left but we have a big 
difference on how we look at central america and i would like to 
see him use his influence with mr castro and if hes got any 
left with mr ortega to facilitate democratic change in the 
western hemisphere and i make clear this isnt just the view of 
the president of the united states but its the view of many 
americans and its the view of oscar arias so when you get into a 
subject like that where he may have a different formula its a 
little more concentrated than when youre clicking off agreements 
in some areas is there anybody here from a thats not accredited 
to the white house only because i dont want to be rude to the 
foreign journalists youre not a foreign journalist 
q inaudible 
a who 
q inaudible 
a you are i wasnt talking to you i was talking to him go 
ahead please 
q could i ask you to elaborate a little more on what you mean 
by european community integration greater european community 
integration 
a what 
q you made a statement before in your statement you referred 
to european community ec greater ec integration 
a well what im talking about is primarily on the economic 
side youre going to have enormous interchange between the east 
and west and what were trying to do in the west and i think the 
ec is trying to do it also is to assist those countries that are 
moving down the democratic path the ec was charged out of our g7 
meeting in paris to move forward on a coordinated economic approach 
to help hungary and poland and so its in that area where i see 
the earliest and the most productive integration 
way to the back on the aisle sir 
q mr president in the last two weeks of june mr gorbachev 
will be in the usa for the summit the very beginning of july the 
g7 will be meeting in houston now you said in malta that you 
wanted to help steward or to help steer the soviet union into the 
global economy is there a prospect that mr gorbachev might stay 
on for the g7 summit or inaudible that summit why dont 
you include some of the eastern inaudible 
a the answer is i dont think so put it this way two 
chances slim and none for that for that particular meeting nor 
did he request to be included in that particular meeting but were 
in times of rapid change and well see how things move forward in 
terms of having a common subject to discuss you see weve got to 
got to understand his dilemma they have not had a market 
economy they have not had the privatization that is that joins 
the g7 together its different and so what i have proposed and 
as opposed to the suggestion the question you ask is that we 
work with them in observer status in the gatt eventually as soon 
as the uruguay round is over do more for him to do more with oecd 
it is important that not just the soviet union but other countries 
in eastern europe understand the market economies understand the 
dynamism of the economic systems that join those seven countries 
so i dont think its likely that you know that he would hang 
around houston waiting for the next meeting 
yeah robby 
q mr president you stepped aside on a question about the 
peace dividend and said that youve got a terrible grammrudman 
problem next year as you look at the changes in europe and the 
possibilities of further defense cuts do you expect any time in 
your first term to have a dividend a peace dividend to apply 
to some of the economic and social problems at home and when would 
you expect that 
a thats an awful tough question to answer about anytime i 
would think it would be extraordinarily difficult because of the 
of the not only the enormity of the grammrudman the difficulty 
of reaching the grammrudman target this year but what follows on 
and so what we are trying to do is emphasize the areas where we can 
be of most help to the people through various programs and i in 
some areas i dont know whether helen mentioned in her question 
education but in some areas it isnt necessarily the problem 
isnt going to be solved by putting more money into it but on your 
question as we go on down on the on meeting these grammrudman 
targets there just isnt a lot of quote excess money 
unquote floating around there 
q not for the foreseeable future not for the rest of your 
first term 
a well look at the grammrudman targets that face us i dont 
want to hold out to those that want to rush out and spend a lot 
more money the hope that that is going to happen weve got some 
tremendous economic problems that have to be solved because the 
best answer to helping people if you have to divide it have to 
quantify it the best is to have a job and the best way to have 
the climate for a job is to have a sound economy and to our 
foreign friends here id say one of the things that would be the 
best guarantee of that would be to get our federal deficits down 
it would also help us with investment and that is the best poverty 
program a job in the private sector and so i cant i dont i 
had a letter from a distinguished senator before i left because he 
had read about possible defense cuts a reduction in the defense 
budget saying take that money and spend it for a cause that he 
felt was very worthy and i had to write him back and say look 
that isnt the way its going to work that isnt the way its 
going to work 
yes 
q mr president you spoke in your opening statement about the 
need for a greater role for the 35 nation group known as csce you 
know that in rome chairman gorbachev raised the possibility of a 
new conference congress of europe i understand that didnt come 
up in malta 
a no it didnt 
q it did 
a no it did not youre right

prime minister margaret thatcher faces reelection 
as conservative party leader tuesday and for the first time since 
she got the job 14 years ago she has a challenger 
sir anthony meyer a rankandfile legislator little known 
outside parliament doesnt expect to win but he hopes to get 
enough votes to send mrs thatcher a message of discontent at a 
time of 73 percent inflation and difficulties over britains place 
in europe 
former defense secretary george younger mrs thatchers 
campaign manager said monday that out of the 374 conservative 
members of parliament eligible to cast ballots he expected up to 
20 will vote for meyer 
some are expected to abstain in a show of disapproval of mrs 
thatchers sometimes autocratic leadership style and her 
reluctance to accept some of the new rules dictated by britains 
membership in the european economic community 
tory lawmaker christopher hawkins says estimates of 
antithatcher votes and abstentions range from 23 to 66 with an 
average prediction of 45 
fortyfive would do mrs thatcher little harm analysts agree it 
would take 100 or more to wound her and no one expects her to lose 
outright early guesses are tricky because many members have 
refused to state their preference before they put their votes in 
the ballot box 
the waverers face a dilemma they want to send her a message 
but not such an overwhelming one that she will feel obliged to 
resign 
conservative lawmakers vote annually on their leader and mrs 
thatcher 64 has been endorsed without opposition since 1975 when 
she ousted former prime minister ted heath 
she has led the conservative to three successive election 
victories since 1979 become the longestserving british prime 
minister this century and said she wants to go on and on 
but public opinion polls show she is the least popular prime 
minister this century her tories are up to 15 points behind the 
opposition labor party and her sweeping economic and social 
reforms have gone too far for many voters 
while the rich have become richer in the past 10 years the 
poor have become poorer said meyer a 69yearold former 
diplomat who represents a welsh constituency and has always been on 
the liberal antithatcher wing of the party 
there is a real limit on the extent to which the electorate is 
prepared to tolerate public squalor whether in filthy streets 
worsening public transport or inadequate schools or hospitals in 
return for private affluence he said monday 
younger said in a weekend television interview that meyer 
wrongly believes there is a vast groundswell who want him to do 
this im afraid the truth is there isnt and people mostly would 
very much wish he hadnt 
to be reelected on the first ballot mrs thatcher needs 57 
percent of the 374 eligible votes a majority plus 15 percent if 
she fails up to two more ballots can be held until a winner 
emerges on a simply majority of 188 votes 
the victor becomes party leader and prime minister subject only 
to the formality of royal approval 
the conservatives hold 375 of the 650 seats in the house of 
commons but speaker bernard weatherill does not vote 
mrs thatcher who has a vote said last week the leadership 
vote was bad for britain and for the party but she defended 
meyers democratic right to challenge her 
opinion polls consistently have named another former defense 
secretary michael heseltine as the person voters would most like 
to replace mrs thatcher 
meyer has said he mounted the challenge not in any hope of 
winning but as a way of enticing more likely candidates into the 
race 
however heseltine has repeatedly said he wont participate in 
the campaign to unseat mrs thatcher although he has not indicated 
whether he will cast a ballot or abstain tuesday

q but even though it didnt its an important suggestion and 
i wonder how you feel about it 
a well i feel about it that i have a with respect to him an 
even more important suggestion and that is that we sign a cfe 
agreement theres something thats very practical thats very 
much within our grasp and i think that should be our prime 
objective for that kind of a meeting 
yeah carl 
q chairman gorbachev said yesterday that you and he agreed in 
your talks that the world that the malta meeting marked the end 
of the epoch of the cold war and entering a new period do you 
agree with him that the cold war is over 
a carl let me tell you something laughter were fooling 
with semantics here i dont want to give you a headline ive told 
you the areas where i think we have progress why do we resort to 
these code words that send different signals to different people 
im not going to answer i can 
q inaudible 
a well good he can speak for himself very in a very 
eloquent way but in terms of if you want me to define it is the 
cold war the same i mean is it raging like it was before in the 
times of the berlin blockade absolutely not things have moved 
dramatically but if i signal to you theres no cold war then 
youll say well what are you doing with troops in europe i 
mean come on 
yeah maureen 
q a question from a soviet journalist 
a is your name maureen sir 
q i am from izvestia newspaper 
a laughs named maureen go ahead 
laughter 
q mr president what is your reaction to chairman gorbachevs 
proposal that nato and the warsaw pact should not remain yet 
military alliances but rather become militarypolitical alliances 
and later on just political alliances can you envisage in the 
future any form of cooperation between the two alliances 
a well i can see an economic interaction and i hope that nato 
will along with the ec and along with oecd and these other areas 
will take more of an active eastwest role in the economy in 
helping each other in terms of systems but he did not press that 
point with me at all i think he envisions an active us presence 
in europe in one way or another 
maureen yes 
q mr president after five hours of talks on saturday despite 
extremely treacherous seas and you even had trouble getting to the 
talks you got back in your launch and went back to your ship mr 
president why did you do that and 
a because i wanted to go back in time to receive him for dinner 
q didnt you understand you were risking the summit number 
one and number two what do you think gorbachev thinks of your 
judgment 
a maureen youve been to maine dont tell me that that little 
chop was laughter was risking anything frankly i havent 
had that much fun in a long time either but the fact that we got 
out there and the seas kicked up even more the winds were up to 
60 knots thats a big 60 miles an hour 50 knots which is a 
big wind and along with it came a swell and along with it came a 
chop but we didnt miss a beat in fact we had a very relaxed 
evening out there and then showed up and we got eight hours of 
talks in so it was a that was a nonissue and i didnt feel 
there was any risk in getting into a little safe launch like that 
and going back out to the ship it was sheer pleasure really 
q and it was hotdogging 
a hotdogging no laughter 
well you know these charismatic macho visionary guys 
theyll do anything laughter 
yeah 
this is the last question ive got to go ive got to go home 
q mr president a few moments ago you questioned whether 
gorbachev had any influence at all over daniel ortega yet in his 
news conference yesterday chairman gorbachev indicated that there 
may be an opportunity now for peace in the region did he indicate 
to you in any way whether one he had any control over ortega or 
two whether there was something in the works that may lead to some 
kind of peaceful political 
a no he didnt but i think he didnt indicate whether he 
had any control over him what he did indicate was that there were 
going to be free elections and i told him thats fine to have 
those free elections but theyve got to be fair you have to have 
access from for the minorities to minority parties and the 
opposition party the uno to get in there and participate a full 
access and so we had a little discussion of that but that was 
about it 
q to follow up if he indicated there would be free elections 
that in turn would indicate that he does in fact maintain some sort 
of influence on ortega and then wouldnt you hold him further 
responsible to stop that flow of arms in el salvador 
a well im not sure that i dont see quite the logic that 
if he says theres going to be a free election that means he 
controls them im unclear on your 
q how could he how could he assure you that there would be 
free elections 
a i dont oh excuse me i dont think he assured me there 
was he just says free elections are scheduled and i told him how 
important we felt it was that they go forward 
i am told that our congressional delegation made up of some 
whove been rather generous in their comments about what the 
sandinistas were about or at least were less than supportive 
historically for the contras were on this delegation and that the 
delegation was denied the right to come in and take a look and i 
told him this is counterproductive this doesnt help and so but 
i dont want to imply from that that he can he can just snap his 
fingers and have mr ortega i think he was do what he said 
i think he was impressed i may be wrong but i i think he was 
impressed by the message from oscar arias and i asked arias if it 
was okay to tell him of the call and he said yes i hope you 
will so when i said this man this nobel prize winner prize 
winner down there who with whom weve had some differences 
though normally were in pretty good sync appeals to you use 
your influence to you know stop the export of revolution it 
may have made an impact 
i really do have to run its supposed to be out of here at for 
those who are flying with us at quarter of and its now fourteen 
of no wait a minute twelve of whats the big hand here im 
getting a little tired audience laughter thank you

the airpollution case involves a gm plant in framingham mass 
and focuses on the joint federalstate system for cleaning up the 
atmosphere 
under the federal clean air act the epa sets national air 
quality standards and states must adopt plans to meet those 
standards 
the epa in 1980 approved a massachusetts plan for reducing 
pollution from paint at autoassembly factories the plan required 
car makers to comply fully with the federal rules by dec 31 1985 
but epa officials extended the deadline for any plant switching 
from lacquer to enamel paints which emit less pollutants 
gm initially planned to stay with lacquer at the framingham 
factory but in june 1985 announced it would convert to enamel paint 
by the summer of 1987 gm asked that it not be required to comply 
with the dec 31 1985 standards until 20 months later 
massachusetts officials approved gms proposal and submitted a 
revised plan to the epa on dec 30 1985 
without waiting for federal approval gm began building a 200 
million plant in framingham to use enamelbased paints while 
continuing to operate its existing factory 
epa officials went to federal court in august 1987 seeking fines 
of up to 25000 a day against gm for 20 months of airquality 
violations at the old plant but it was not until september 1988 
that the epa rejected the stateapproved pollutioncontrol system 
at the new plant 
a federal judge barred the epa from fining gm for violations of 
the dec 31 1985 standards ruling that the federal agency itself 
violated the clean air act by taking more than four months to rule 
on the stateapproved plan submitted dec 30 1985 
but the 1st circuit court last june said the epas failure to 
meet the fourmonth deadline does not disqualify it from fining 
companies that violate previously approved pollutioncontrol rules 
the appeals court told the trial judge to decide how much the 
fines should be advising him to consider whether the epas delay 
was reasonable and what impact the delay had on gm 
the us chamber of commerce joined gm in urging the supreme 
court to review the dispute 
chamber of commerce lawyers said the 1st circuit court ruling 
invites unfair treatment for businesses the bush administration 
said the 1st circuit court ruling was correct

steroid use may build strength and add weight he said but 
taking the drugs also increases health risks sammartino said the 
benefits arent worth the possible damage to the heart liver and

the problem is that you still hear a doctor now and then

security agents stood guard today outside the 
offices of former disgraced communist leaders to safeguard 
documents and other evidence that could be used in investigations 
of highlevel corruption 
wolfgang schwanitz the national security chief barred all 
flights to romania following reports that sensitive material was 
being smuggled out of the country to the hardline warsaw pact ally 
members of the largest opposition group demanded a referendum on 
german reunification and urged the government to allow quick free 
elections one spokesman said communist leaders had lost all 
legitimacy 
premier hans modrow a communist reformer emerged as the 
countrys no 1 political leader after the entire party leadership 
resigned in disgrace sunday and left a 25member committee in 
control of the government 
protests continued despite the resignations 
we dont need any politburo and central committee that is made 
up of criminals one woman screamed at a rally of about 10000 
people sunday night in east berlin this should have happened long 
ago a man shouted 
the official adn news agency said security agents were stationed 
outside party offices in east berlin to prevent former members of 
the politburo and central committee from gaining access to 
documents in file cabinets and safes 
agents also stood guard outside official guest houses following 
growing public resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the former 
leadership it said the security measures were aimed at keeping 
valuables and possibly documents that might be used as evidence 
from being removed 
several former leaders have been accused in a growing corruption 
investigation of abusing their powers and stealing money from the 
state 
modrow the 61yearold reformer and former dresden party chief 
led east germanys delegation at the warsaw pact summit that began 
in moscow today adn reported 
also attending the summit were foreign minister oskar fischer 
and egon krenz who resigned as party chief sunday along with the 
partys 10member ruling politburo and its entire 163member 
central committee 
krenz went to the moscow meeting in the largely ceremonial role 
of head of state adn mentioned no further role for him 
just two months ago the partys hierarchy enforced ironfisted 
rule now the former ruling elite has its back against the wall as 
demands grow for punishment of those who lived in style while east 
germany sank into crisis 
modrow elected premier nov 13 by a parliament that broke with 
the discredited communists now appears in charge of daytoday 
affairs and official newspapers predicted an imminent split in the 
communist party 
public resentment of the ruling communists has reached a fever 
pitch and modrow is seen as more acceptable than the ousted 
authoritarian leadership that long shunned him 
many of the partys rankandfile are disgusted with the high 
life the ousted elite is reported to have enjoyed 
in sundays housecleaning erich honecker krenzs predecessor 
as party leader and 11 other members of the hardline old guard 
were expelled from the party three former politburo members were 
arrested on corruption charges and the countrys chief of trade 
with the west fled 
the pressure on the party increased today with the opposition 
group new forum demanding a law allowing quick free elections 
the group with 200000 members also urged a national 
referendum to decide on german reunification there have been 
growing calls to reunite the two germanys but new forum previously 
had warned against such suggestions 
a statement signed by new forum leaders claus gerd scheidig and 
christiane paetzold said the longterm possibility of one german 
state within present borders of the two countries was no longer 
an unthinkable utopia 
the statement urged all new forum organizations to press for a 
quick a referendum to find out what the real wish of the people 
was on the issue of reunification 
west germany claims that most east germans want reunification 
but there have been no opinion polls or other indications of how 
east germans feel about the issue 
among the reformers named sunday to the new 25member communist 
party committee are dresden mayor wolfgang berghofer and the 
countrys former spy chief markus wolf 
a spokesman for the committee gregor gysi said its immediate 
task would be to investigate corruption among the discredited 
communist elite 
the committee will effectively rule as the party prepares for a 
special congress on dec 15 when it is expected to choose new 
leaders 
several hundred thousand people joined hands to form human 
chains in sections across the country sunday and displayed signs 
calling for the removal of the central committee mafia and 
imprisonment for exparty criminals 
the party that has ruled east germany for all its 40 years has 
already abolished its guaranteed monopoly on power and promised 
free elections for as early as next year 
krenz was not named to the new reform committee his was the 
shortest reign of any east german leader 
responding to massive protest demonstrations krenz opened the 
berlin wall on nov 9 and promised reforms including free 
elections but calls increased for his removal because of his past 
links to honeckers rule 
guenter schabowski among those ousted from the politburo said 
the 12 expelled sunday were suspected of serious violations of 
party statutes among those thrown out were expremier willi 
stoph and former parliament speaker horst sindermann

the soviet union and the four other warsaw pact 
nations that invaded czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush a reform 
movement today condemned the action 
the statement came as east bloc leaders including the first 
noncommunist head of state met for a warsaw pact meeting to hear 
president mikhail s gorbachevs report on his recent talks with 
president bush 
the leaders of the soviet union bulgaria hungary east germany 
and poland said the entrance of their troops into czechoslovakia 21 
years ago constitituted interference in the internal affairs of a 
sovereign czechoslovakia and must be condemned 
interrupting the process of democratic renewal in 
czechoslovakia these unjustified actions had longterm negative 
consequences added the statement which was read on the evening 
news and carried by the official tass news agency 
the sovietled invasion crushed the prague spring reforms of 
alexander dubcek who was subsequently ousted as the communist 
party leader he has since reemerged as one of the spokespeople of 
the prodemocracy movement sweeping czechoslovakia 
meanwhile president bush was in brussels briefing nato leaders 
on the summit dutch foreign minister hans van den broek said bush 
told the allies he and gorbachev agreed to propose to their 
allies a meeting of government leaders at the signing of an 
agreement on conventional disarmament 
the leaders meeting in moscow included wojciech jaruzelski 
polands communist president and egon krenz of east germany who 
resigned as his countrys communist party chief sunday along with 
the rest of the politburo but retained the ceremonial post of 
president 
the east german news agency adn said premier hans modrow headed 
the nations delegation 
tass did not mention the arrival of polands solidarity prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki the first noncommunist east bloc 
leader to attend a warsaw pact meeting since the alliance was 
created in 1955 in response to the formation of the north atlantic 
treaty organization 
mazowieckis participation highlights the radical changes that 
have occurred recently in eastern europe 
tass said gorbachev would tell the allies of his weekend talks 
in malta with bush but it did not say when the soviet leader would 
address the meeting 
tass announced earlier that western journalists would not be 
accredited for the meeting and said they would have to depend on 
staterun soviet media for reports 
the warsaw pact last held a meeting in july in romania since 
then there have been dramatic political changes in many of the 
member countries and calls for reforms within the pact itself 
east germays longtime leader erich honecker was ousted oct 18 
after thousands of citizens fled to the west and others staged mass 
protests for reforms krenz replaced honecker and on nov 9 his 
government bowed to continued pressure and opened east germanys

sales of new homes fell 05 percent in 
october the government reported monday analysts said overall 
purchases were driven down by a 247 percent decline in the west 
due to the san francisco bayarea earthquake and the effects of the 
slowing economy 
but economists said the sales pace should improve somewhat over 
the next few months as mortgage interest rates drop to the mid9 
percent range no analyst predicted a surge in sales 
the report says that housing market activity has improved some 
from the sluggish pace of march and february but that the market 
is by no means taking off thomas holloway senior economist for 
the mortgage bankers association said 
the commerce department said new singlefamily homes were sold 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 649000 in october 
following a revised 102 percent plunge in september september 
sales originally were reported down 14 percent 
sales in the west fell 53000 units on an annual basis to 
161000 homes but all other regions posted gains prompting david 
berson chief economist for the federal national mortgage 
association to conclude the earthquake appeared to keep people 
from buying new homes 
michael carliner an economist with the national association of 
home builders said economic sluggishness also contributed to the 
lack of western sales part of the problem he said was slower 
defense spending which resulted in significant layoffs 
home sales had fallen dramatically earlier this year as the 
federal reserve board pumped up interest rates to slow the economy 
and thus contain inflation as inflationary pressures cooled 
however the fed has permitted gradual decreases in rates since the 
beginning of the summer 
fixedrate mortgage interest rates fell to an average of 982 
percent by the end of october after rising into the double digits 
in september according to a survey by the federal home loan 
mortgage corp 
despite the lower interest rates michael p niemira an 
economist with the mitsubishi bank in new york said the new home 
market appears to be hurt by the everwidening gap between new and 
existing home prices 
builders also appear to be misreading the current market he 
said it is a market for lowpriced homes and builders generally 
are not building for that market 
the commerce department said the median price of a new home in 
october rose 53 percent to 127900 the median means half of the 
homes cost more and half less the average price of a new home was 
unchanged at 151900 
on the other hand the national association of realtors reported 
monday that the median price of an existing singlefamily home was 
92100 
new home sales in the northeast rose 478 percent but fannie 
maes berson said that reflected a low september sales count rather 
than growing market strength in the area 
the south posted a 57 percent increase while the midwest 
recorded a 37 percent gain 
newhome sales for the first nine months were down 44 percent 
from the same period in 1988 
in its report the real estate trade group said that its index 
measuring the ability of the typical american family to buy an 
existing home rose in october to its highest level in eight months 
because of stable mortgage rates and a drop in the median home 
price 
the real estate group said the index rose to 1061 from 1035 
in september and was the highest since it was 1067 last february 
that means a family with a median income of 33365 had 1061 
percent of the income needed to buy a medianpriced existing home 
costing 92100

president bush said monday his meeting 
with mikhail s gorbachev gave the two leaders a chance to cement a 
personal relationship though it wasnt all sweetness and light 
in a news conference before leaving europe after briefing the 
nato allies on his summit talks with gorbachev bush summed up his 
own new relationship with the soviet president forged in the 
stormy waters off malta during their weekend of talks aboard a 
soviet cruise ship 
what happened was i think he took my measure and i took his 
and i think we just feel more comfortable about our common 
objectives said bush 
he hedged a bit when asked if he considered the soviet leader a 
personal friend that they had friendly conversations was as 
far as he would go 
but bush made clear that gorbachev had made an impression on him 
i feel i can sense much more clearly the things he feels more 
strongly about and we had a good chance to point out to him some 
of the difficulties with our relationship it wasnt all sweetness 
and light said the president 
in their private sessions aboard the maxim gorky anchored 
firmly to harbor against the harsh december storm gorbachev was 
less openly emotional than when he presided buoyantly with bush on 
sunday over the first joint news conference for soviet and american 
leaders 
in public gorbachev felt free to joke about his summit partner 
talking of the importance of cautiousness and i use the 
favorite word by president bush 
gorbachev also praised the malta meeting enthusiastically 
saying it had placed his relationship with bush on a different 
level 
bush said as i watched the way in which mr gorbachev has 
handled the changes in eastern europe it deserves new thinking it 
absolutely mandates new thinking 
noting gorbachevs willingness to consider disproportionate 
troop withdrawals from europe and his support for peaceful change 
and a right of warsaw pact countries to make their own choices 
bush said that he and the western allies feel a certain respect 
for what hes doing and thus we want to try to meet him on some of 
the areas where he needs help 
in the malta talks bush said he seemed very much in control 
you can tell the way that he interacted with his own top people 
there he felt very confident in discussing without notes a wide 
array of subjects with me 
he seemed subdued is the wrong word but i would say 
determined and unemotional about it the most emotion we saw was at 
that press conference yesterday but it was a wonderful 
presentation said bush 
the two leaders didnt resolve us grievances over the actions 
of sovietbacked governments and rebels in central america but 
even there bush sounded a more conciliatory note than he had before 
he spoke at length of gorbachevs support for free elections in 
nicaragua and said he felt the soviet leader was impressed by 
the message from oscar arias the costa rican president who 
relayed a complaint about a destructive role by fidel castros 
cuba in the western hemisphere 
even on nicaraguan president daniel ortega long a nemesis of 
us policy bush sounded an understanding note about what he 
portrayed as gorbachevs limited influence over a government that 
receives massive support from the kremlin 
bush said he did not want to imply that gorbachev can just 
snap his fingers and have mr ortega do what he said

the voice of america the us 
governments broadcast service opened its second soviet bloc 
bureau monday and launched discussions with polish state radio on 
the exchange of programming 
they were jamming us two years ago said voa director 
richard w carlson 
to mark the opening of the poland bureau voa and polish radio 
prepared a live monday night program permitting callers in poland 
to discuss their countrys economic situation with polishspeaking 
experts in washington chicago new york and warsaw 
this is unheard of given the context of our journalistic 
relationship with this country so recently carlson said it is 
definitely amazing we did not envision this at all 
voa which broadcasts in 43 languages to an estimated 130 
million people worldwide for years was jammed by east bloc 
countries and denounced by their leaders voa correspondents were 
denied visas to work in eastern europe or given only limited access 
jamming has ended in the soviet bloc in recent years carlson 
said and voa opened a moscow bureau last year 
voa heard by an estimated 50 percent of polands adults at 
least once a week was given permanent accreditation in poland in 
april carlson said 
no fulltime correspondent has been assigned due to budget 
constraints but the warsaw bureau will be staffed on a rotating 
basis by reporters stationed elsewhere 
a warsaw bureau also is being established by radio free europe 
another longtime propaganda enemy for its uncensored reports to 
eastern europe 
the strict state control of polish radio and tv loosened in 
1988 the solidarityled government of tadeusz mazowiecki who 
became the east blocs first noncommunist leader in august has 
vowed to free the flow of information 
on nov 13 polish radio ran a live broadcast provided by the 
voa of solidarity leader lech walesas speech to the us congress 
voa which produces six hours of live polishlanguage reports 
daily from washington headquarters will continue talks with polish 
authorities on placing its programming on state radio carlson said 
also being discussed are exchanges of broadcasters and training 
programs carlson said 
voa correspondents are being welcomed elsewhere in eastern 
europe as well 
hungary offers virtually free access and czechoslovakia has 
provided ongoing accreditaion for czech and englishlanguage 
correspondents said william hill chief of the voa european 
division 
bulgaria recently allowed a voa representative to cover an 
environmental forum and after 18 visa denials during three years 
a voa correspondent was accredited for east germanys 40th 
anniversary events attended by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev hill said 
only romania and albania continue to bar the correspondents 
with romania dening access to a party congress last month he said

nearly 33 million retirees will have to pay 
premiums for several more months for medicare catastrophic coverage 
a program that will be abolished on dec 31 
gwendolyn king commissioner of the social security 
administration blamed congress late action in repealing the law 
she said monday there is no way that social security computers can 
be adjusted more quickly to halt withholding of the premiums from 
monthly benefit checks 
the premiums will be refunded in a lump sum later ms king said 
we have people going flat out but we wont be able to make 
all the changes until perhaps the end of april or the beginning of 
may ms king said 
that means the great majority of retirees perhaps up to 29 
million will have to pay 530 a month for three or four months 
for a program that will no longer exist some retirees pay less 
others pay more 
the bottom line is that social security will unscramble this 
egg but we did not lay it ms king said 
sen david pryor dark chairman of the senate aging 
committee said in a letter to ms king that a lengthy delay in 
halting collection of the premiums will create a firestorm of 
protest we must recognize the impending firestorm and move rapidly 
to alleviate the problem 
pryor predicted that if the social security administration 
continues withholding the premiums until early summer it could 
take the rest of the year for retirees to get their money back 
pryor estimated that would temporarily take 1 billion out of 
the pockets of the elderly in many cases he said they need that 
money to pay private medigap insurance policy premium increases 
expected to result from repeal of federal catastrophic coverage 
we knew there might be a problem but i dont think we expected 
it to take this long to resolve said john rother of the american 
association of retired persons congress normally gives the 
social security administraton about a threemonth lead time for 
changes 
since jan 1 most people 65 and older have been paying 4 a 
month to finance part of the cost of medicare catastrophic 
coverage the yearold program aims to prevent a retiree from being 
by bankrupted by a major illness the monthly premium is scheduled 
to rise to 530 on jan 1 
premiums paid this year will not be refunded they finance 
extended hospital coverage and other minor catastrophic benefits 
that have been in effect since january 
twothirds of the cost of the program would have been borne by 
higherincome retirees through an income surtax of up to 800 a 
year 
officials have no way of knowing whether those people have been 
making periodic payments of the surtax along with their quarterly 
estimated payments of income tax those who have and those past 65 
who are earning wages and may have paid the surtax through the 
withholding system will be able to subtract the surtax from taxes 
due with they file their returns early next year 
congress repealed catastrophic because of protests from those 
higherincome retirees and from others who have a private 
catastrophic plan or coverage geared to their retirement benefits 
the repeal vote came nov 22 although congress has adjourned 
until jan 23 the bill has not yet been delivered to president 
bush for his signature that could come this week 
ms king pryor and rother said they regret that some people 
with the lowest income will be hurt by the delay in halting 
collection of the premiums 
my concern is for those on fixed income who cannot afford to 
see 5 go out of their checks ms king said thats a lot of 
money for those people and it is little consolation for them to 
know they will get a refund in the future

love has found new champions in the 
battle to allow a finnish exchange student to return to high school 
here after being banished to maine because he was spending too much 
time with his american girlfriend 
iiro lehtinen 18 said he was given two hours to pack his bags 
nov 11 before being transferred to south portland maine because 
exchange program leaders said his friendship with kelly lapointe 
was causing his grades to suffer 
lehtinen in farmington briefly sunday spent about an hour at 
lapointes home with her and her family met with a state 
legislator who has taken an interest in the case and was 
interviewed for two national television programs 
his transfer prompted a walkout last week of about 100 
students a third of farmingtons student body 
officials of the education foundation for foreign study which 
sponsors the exchange program say lehtinen was transferred because 
he was spending too much time with lapointe and not enough time 
with his host family 
the groups regional director meg holliday has denied anyone 
from her organization told the youths they had to break up but 
lehtinen said he was told by an official after he got to south 
portland that he had two weeks to break up with lapointe 
he said the order since has been replaced with directives 
limiting him to one visit and two telephone conversations with 
lapointe a month 
state rep william tsiros said the move was an insult to 
farmingtons hospitality and a violation of the boys civil rights 
the foundation and the host family are missing the point that 
it is normal for an 18yearold boy to have a romantic relationship 
with a girl tsiros said 
lapointe 17 said the foundation officials make it sound like 
she sat around all day in front of the television waiting for 
lehtinen to come over 
im on the honor roll im a big sister and i play sports 
yearround she said whenever iiro and i were together we were 
out with other people at high school games and functions 
tsiros said he has called state officials in concord federal 
officials in washington and the foundation headquarters in 
massachusetts to try to bring lehtinen back 
and the boys father has been lobbying from finland to reverse 
the decision 
the host family wont talk about the dispute

while europe is shedding the legacy of world war 
ii a british libel trial has in a way resurrected it 
the case that britons were reading about in their sunday 
newspapers even as president bush and president mikhail s 
gorbachev were meeting to shape the postpostwar era revived a 
littleknown horror in may 1945 when the british army repatriated 
70000 cossack and yugoslav refugees to a grisly fate at the hands 
of their communist enemies 
the trial ended last week in a record 26 million award and 
showed the abiding power of world war ii to disrupt lives and pose 
painful questions a generation later 
the victorious plaintiff in the high court in london was lord 
aldington former conservative party deputy chairman business 
leader and college head in 1945 he was brig toby low the officer 
based in alliedoccupied austria who was ordered to implement the 
deportation 
the most prominent defendant was count nikolai tolstoy a 
historian who had written a pamphlet accusing aldington of 
responsibility for sending the cossacks and yugoslavs men women 
and children to the firing squads or labor camps 
aldington 74 endured 30 hours of crossexamination at one 
stage he stopped answering questions and wept 
tolstoy and codefendant nigel watts a realtor who distributed 
the pamphlet were ordered to pay the damages plus an almost equal 
sum in legal costs 
tolstoy said the verdict had left him financially ruined 
for some the case had modernday resonances in britains 
imminent plans to repatriate 40000 vietnamese boat people encamped 
in hong kong 
columnist simon jenkins 46 wrote in the sunday times that his 
generation should be wary of using hindsight to judge officers 
acting 44 years ago in the chaotic aftermath of a fiveyear war 
but he wondered whether after the boat people were dealt with 
after hundreds more deaths will there be remorseful memoirs 
bitter accusations and yet more libel trials 
the russian cossacks and yugoslavs who had fled the soviet army 
to safety behind british lines were anticommunist antisoviet 
and in many cases had fought for the germans 
britain had agreed secretly with soviet dictator josef stalin to 
return all soviet and yugoslav prisoners it had no illusions the 
evacuees faced a rough time after repatriation but felt bound by 
the agreement in order to ensure the repatriation of its own 
prisoners in soviet hands 
the story that unfolded over nine weeks in the packed court was 
filled with anguish it told of british authorities resorting to 
subterfuge telling the prisoners they were being sent to safety in 
italy of prisoners killing themselves while still in british 
hands of british soldiers allowing prisoners to escape rather than 
have them on their conscience of other soldiers riflebutting them 
into the trains despising them for having been progerman 
nigel nicolson a young officer at the time remembered seeing 
men herded into cattle trucks and sent screaming to certain 
execution 
we considered it one of the most disgraceful operations any 
british troops anywhere had been ordered to undertake nicolson 
now 72 testified 
aldington said he had only obeyed orders and had no reason to 
believe executions would follow 
there were many officers who were very unhappy about what we 
had to do and i was amongst them but i didnt make a fuss about 
it i just got on with my job he testified 
aldington told his crossexaminer you say i knew they were 
going to be massacred that is not what i was told i was told that 
war criminals would be tried and others would be put to work 
it is terrible what happened i know nobodys denying that 
what happened was ghastly i dont understand why you want to harry 
me over and over again 
tolstoy the britishborn grandson of a russian cossack has 
written several books aimed at exposing what he calls an 
inexcusable coverup in british public life 
robert knight a teacher of european studies who testified for 
aldington wrote in the guardian that tolstoy had sunk into the 
swamp of his own conspiracy theory 
in summing up the judge said some might think the verdict would 
settle the debate for good it would be very nice to think it 
would he said but it seems to me unlikely that will happen

president bush today hailed the 
peaceful revolution sweeping communist eastern europe but 
pledged the united states would keep significant military 
forces on the continent as long as allied leaders want them there 
bush who spent the weekend in summit talks with mikhail s 
gorbachev emerged from a meeting with nato leaders to praise the 
soviet leaders handling of the changes throughout the eastern 
bloc he it absolutely mandates new thinking on the part of 
western leaders 
at the same time bush wouldnt go along with gorbachevs 
postsummit declaration on sunday that the world was leaving the 
epoch of the cold war 
said bush if i signal to you theres no cold war then theyll 
say well what are you doing with troops in europe 
bushs meeting with nato leaders was private but dutch foreign 
minister hans van den broek told reporters the president said the 
superpower leaders agreed in malta to aim for an eastwest summit 
in vienna next summer to sign a landmark treaty reducing 
conventional forces in europe 
lets get it done the president said at his news 
conference he said he wanted the accord in the bank before 
moving on to more complicated matters 
bush and the allied leaders met as gorbachev was convening a 
meeting of a radically reordered warsaw pact in moscow 
the president was in good humor as he neared the end of his 
summit journey he laughed off a reporters suggestion that he had 
been at risk during bad weather in malta when he boarded a small 
boat for a brief trip through rough seas to return to a warship 
anchored offshore 
these charismatic visionary macho guys theyll do 
anything he said to laughter 
bush was flying home shortly after his news conference 
the 16 nato and seven warsaw pact nations are negotiating in 
vienna on cuts in conventional forces in europe van den broek 
quoted bush as saying he hoped an accord could be reached about 
mid1990 
conventional forces aside the superpowers are negotiating a 
treaty to cut longrange nuclear weapons by up to 50 percent and a 
separate agreement on banning chemical weapons 
on the subject of trade bush signaled his intention anew to 
help the battered soviet economy but when asked whether gorbachev 
would be invited to next years economic summit of industrial 
democracies he replied two chances slim and none for that 
particular meeting nor did he request to be included in that 
particular meeting he said 
bush said that while all was not sweetness and light at the 
malta summit even as he applauded gorbachevs handling of the 
change in eastern europe 
asked what had emerged at the summit he said i think he took 
my measure and i took his and i think we both feel more comfortable 
about our common objectives 
he said gorbachev was determined and unemotional in their 
private talks the soviet leader seemed very much in control 
and very confident in discussing without notes a wide array of 
subjects with me 
the conventional arms talks are designed to reduce us troops 
in europe by 30000 and soviet troops by 325000 to a level of 
about 275000 on each side the negotiations also are attempting to 
control tanks and other weapons 
the importance of this is that it indicates both bush and 
gorbachev want to make an effort to reach such an agreement next 
year van den broek said 
in that context the term mid1990 was mentioned without a 
doubt that should be regarded as positive he said 
bush was asked whether the improvement in eastwest relations 
could free money for domestic programs such as education and the 
homeless i think it is premature to speak as some are at home 
about a peace dividend he said 
bush noted large federal deficits and said there isnt excess 
money available 
the president began his news conference with a statement that 
said a peaceful revolution was taking place in eastern europe 
where five hardline communist regimes have fallen in recent weeks 
and some coutries have experienced more than one change in 
government 
he said his goal was to see individual freedom everywhere 
replace coercion and tyranny 
he said the task for western nations is to consolidate the 
fruits of this peaceful revolution and provide the architecture or 
the continued peaceful changes and end the division of europe and 
germany and create a europe whole and free 
at the same time he said the western alliance must remain 
strong and said the united states will maintain significant 
military forces in europe as long as our allies desire our 
presence 
even as bush was preparing to leave for home secretary of state 
james a baker iii was making arrangements for a trip to west 
berlin next week his trip will take him to the most notable symbol 
of the cold war the berlin wall which has effectively crumbled 
a british official said bushs summit briefing for allied 
leaders was extremely wellreceived and that todays session 
showed very strong support for the nato alliance 
baker said bush outlined his agreements and differences with 
gorbachev most everyone there was very pleased baker said on 
nbctvs today show 
brent scowcroft the presidents national security adviser said 
the nato allies were particularly interested in the issue of german 
reunification which gorbachev opposes 
the president is certainly not going to stand in the way of 
reunification but it needs to proceed at its own pace scowcroft 
said on abctvs good morning america 
according to a knowledgeable belgian source who spoke only on 
condition he not be identified bush criticized gorbachevs denial 
that the soviets were supplying arms to leftist rebels in el 
salvador as out of step with the new thinking in moscow 
the arrival of bushs 10car motorcade at nato headquarters for 
the second meeting of allied leaders this year was heralded by a 
noisy helicopter providing security and surveillance for the 
entourage nato staff members applauded bush as he briskly strode 
into the building 
in opening remarks nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner said 
the nato leaders second meeting since may reflects the 
accelerated pace of political change across europe he said the 
question of the architecture of the future europe has arrived 
before us more quickly than anyone could have predicted 
the president who flew here sunday night immediately after the 
summit had said the meeting helped dispel gorbachevs doubts about 
bushs attitude toward economic and political reforms in the soviet 
union as the united states applauds the fall of hardline 
communist regimes throughout eastern europe 
i dont think he has me down as a total negativist at all and 
i certainly dont have him down that way bush said before 
leaving the mediterranean island of malta where he held eight 
hours of discussions with gorbachev aboard the soviet cruise liner

a defiant liberty bell stands on a 
hill above prague but many now notice revolutionaries failed to 
add a clapper to their makeshift symbol theyre still building the 
revolution 
the communists are playing for time and we cant rest a 
minute said lenka ressova a young technician before joining 
more than 150000 people monday on wenceslas square 
the crowd chanting resign resign delivered its verdict 
on a new communistdominated cabinet meant to shape a new 
czechoslovakia in thundering unison people added free 
elections 
but at opposition headquarters civic forum leaders wrestled 
with a problem now familiar as the iron curtain tatters where to 
find popular experienced leaders in societies ruled 40 years by a 
single ideology 
theyre fighting over every line reported a civic forum 
member emerging from strategy talks over how to protest a new 
government of communist party holdovers and only five littleknown 
outsiders this will not be easy 
he asked anonymity no longer afraid of secret police but wanted 
to stay clear of internal politics 
the overall mood is confident even ebullient as czechoslovaks 
try out new freedoms few dreamed were possible only weeks ago but 
cold hard realism has replaced the first warm rush 
a clear strain of anxiety that marked faces at mondays mass 
rally was reflected all over town politics penetrated every 
crevice of prague 
no one talks of anything else said hana lingerova slinging 
plates of roast pork at the old synagogue cafe she amused 
customers by making folds in a banknote to turn a pictured 
communist hero into the movie alien from et the 
extraterrestrial 
in downtown metro stops huge crowds mobbed public tv sets in 
the outskirts people rose at 330 am to get the morning papers 
before they sold out 
at the charles university faculty of medicine and physics 
frazzled students watched tv nibbled at stale sandwiches and 
churned out leaflets on their prehistoric computers 
milan horak 21 studied a visiting reporters passport with 
more care than the immigration officer at prague airport 
infiltrators are trying to sneak in to divide us and change 
our minds he said a revolutionary guard was comprised of four 
sleepy students armed with a guitar 
horak acknowledged that although people demand that the 
communists hand over power no alternate leaders were emerging 
our leaders are compromised and the people who could lead were 
driven off he said 
asked about alexander dubcek horak gave the awkward shrug which 
often greets that name dubcek a powerful symbol led 
czechoslovakia to the prague spring that was crushed by warsaw 
pact tanks 21 years ago but for most young people he has been a 
communist for too long 
vaclav havel the playwright whose lifelong insistence on human 
freedoms shaped the script for the revolution rejects any 
prolonged role in the politics of what comes next 
in the vacuum of power untested names rise in moments of glory 
there are insistent calls for valtr komarek a reformminded 
economist but critics say he is blemished by his close ties to the 
failing system 
now comes the hard part the pressure of the mind said 
jaroslav nesetril a professor who dropped in to check on the 
students the communists are more experienced more organized it 
is in nature that everything is reversible 
in the bowels of the abc theater people who helped bring off 
the revolution harbor few illusions about the next act they admire 
havel and the intellectuals around him but most agree it is time 
for others to move in 
that is the question where to find the leaders said ivo 
niederle a popular actor we must find them 
havel has offered to play some sort of transitional role but 
has made it plain he is not eager to be the missing clapper in 
czechoslovakias liberty bell 
late saturday night he emerged from a dinner haggard 
are you going into politics he was asked

president bush and soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev are finding it easier to endorse political change 
in europe than to deal with the consequences 
after a summit meeting in which both leaders envisioned an end 
to eastwest rivalry they face the considerably more difficult 
task of redefining their respective military alliances without 
upsetting a balance of power established through 40 years of cold 
war 
for gorbachev the assignment is especially tricky he seeks to 
preserve his warsaw pact alliance at the same time that its 
hardline communist regimes are being swept aside during the 
postsummit news conference a czechoslovakian journalist pointedly 
asked whether he had renounced the brezhnev doctrine used to 
justify the 1968 soviet invasion of that country as it began to tip 
westward 
every nation is an independent entity in world politics and 
every people has the right to choose its own destiny the destiny 
of its own state the soviet leader replied 
gorbachevs response underscored the diminishing role and 
perhaps ability of the kremlin to control the political avalanche 
in eastern europe 
no one can avoid this evolutionary process he said 
bush following gorbachev in response to the czechoslovakian 
question praised the soviet leader for the reforms he has started 
in the soviet union and its allies 
however the president is not as eager to claim as the soviet 
leader had at the joint news conference that the epoch of the 
cold war is over 
on monday after he briefed nato allies in brussels bush said 
is the cold war raging like it was before in the times of the 
berlin blockade absolutely not but if i signal to you theres no 
cold war then theyll say well what are you doing with troops 
in europe 
both leaders say they want to preserve the north atlantic treaty 
organization and the warsaw pact to maintain stability but want to 
conclude an agreement by late 1990 to cut troops in central europe 
withdrawing 30000 us and 325000 soviet soldiers 
the memory of nazi germany which invaded many nato and warsaw 
pact members during world war ii still looms large in the european 
equation 
gorbachev has expressed concern about a proposal last week by 
west german chancellor helmut kohl for a confederation of east and 
west germany soviet officials say west germany has never renounced 
its claims to the prewar german borders which included parts of 
poland 
bush sought to assuage those soviet fears by reaffirming us 
support for the 1975 helsinki accords which were signed by the 
united states soviet union and 33 other nations and spells out a 
concept of permanent borders 
the helsinki accords said gorbachev summed up the results of 
the second world war and consolidated the results of the war 
and the reality is such that we have todays europe with two german 
states 
bush reiterated the us position that any move toward the 
reunification of germany will have to be gradual and respect the 
rights of people on both sides of the present border to 
selfdetermination 
at the same time bush made it clear that the united states will 
keep its troops in europe as long as nato allies want them there 
the united states will remain a european power and that means 
that the united states will stay engaged in the future of europe 
and in our common defense bush said 
to cope with soviet concerns about germany unified outside the 
postwar alliance strucure and to keep pace with the changes in 
eastern europe gorbachev has accepted polish proposals to 
restructure the warsaw pact nato should do the same he said 
they should not remain military alliances but rather 
militarypolitical alliances and later on just political 
alliances so that their nature would change in accordance with the 
changes on the continent he said

a ussoviet dispute over naval 
disarmament unrelieved by the weekend seaside summit will likely 
keep the mediterranean the worlds most heavily armed waters for 
years to come 
along with central america the rivalry of the two superpower 
navies especially in the mediterranean surfaced as the most 
publicly divisive issue to confront president bush and soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev at their stormbuffetted sessions 
bush ruled out any immediate progress 
the chairman raised the question of naval arms control and i 
was not particularly positive in responding bush told a 
concluding joint news conference with gorbachev we still have 
differences with the soviet union he knows it and i know it 
defense secretary richard cheney put it even more bluntly 
naval forces are absolutely crucial to the united states he 
said in a sunday interview on nbcs meet the press 
we are a major maritime power our ability to reinforce our 
allies in europe is tied to our naval forces and were not 
interested in limitations on those forces cheney said 
a setting for fierce battles since the birth of western 
civilization the mediterranean since world war ii has seen many 
engagements and confrontations among the 17 bordering nations and 
outside powers like the united states and the soviet union 
the us 6th fleet whose flagship the uss belknap was bushs 
home for the summit keeps 30 ships 100 aircraft and 20000 troops 
at sea operating under nato direction in case of conflict 
most of the largest recipients of us military aid egypt 
israel turkey and greece border the mediterranean the united 
states keeps bases in four mediterranean countries 
the united states has flown over the mediterranean to bomb 
libya shipped marines through it to lebanon and intercepted 
airliners and ships carrying terrorists above and through its 
waters 
the soviet union on the other hand has been steadily 
decreasing its mediterranean fleet to 30 or 40 vessels since 1985

prime minister zeid bin shaker resigned 
monday and was replaced by mudar badran who has held the office 
twice before and is sympathetic to islamic fundamentalists 
king hussein told badran to concentrate on improving jordans 
dismal economy situation and to support the palestine liberation 
organization 
bin shakers resignation had been expected following 
parliamentary elections last month the first nationwide balloting 
in 22 years he took office in april after the resignation of zaid 
rifai and formed a transitional government for the purpose of 
preparing for the elections 
the king assigned the outgoing cabinet to continue its duties 
until badran forms a new one 
i ask you to work with the plo and to support the 
steadfastness of our brothers the palestinians in their occupied 
territories hussein said in a letter to badran the former chief 
of the royal court 
the monarch stressed the importance of increasing the kingdoms 
foreign currency reserves and maintaining the jordanian dinars 
purchasing power 
since late last year the dinars value against other currencies 
has fallen sharply under the pressure of foreign debts of more than 
83 billion 
riots triggered by price increases of 10 percent to 50 percent 
for food and fuel led to riots that killed nine people in april and 
led to rifais resignation 
royal palace officials said naming of a new cabinet might be 
delayed because of disputes among potential new ministers over the 
assignment of portfolios 
the palace officials said the new cabinet would include some 
former ministers some members of the royally appointed senate and 
some deputies elected nov 8 
according to one royal palace source the disputes stem from 
three moslem brotherhood deputies who were assigned portfolios 
which they did not accept 
the source did not explain what chairs they were assigned but he 
said they were seeking the portfolios of education higher 
education and islamic religious affairs 
the moslem brotherhood which won 25 seats in parliament 
campaigned to impose stricter islamic laws and improve social 
welfare benefits there are nearly three dozen deputies in the 
80seat parliament with islamic leanings 
badran is known to sympathize with extremist moslem factions 
including the moslem brotherhood 
the november elections were the first nationwide poll since 1967 
when israel captured the west bank from jordan hussein last year 
renounced jordans claim to the west bank in favor of the palestine 
liberation organization 
badran who graduated from the university of damscus in 1957 
with a law degree served as prime minister as well as defense and 
foreign affairs minister in 197679 and 198084 
during both of badrans terms jordanian relations with syria 
deteriorated first because syrian alleged jordan was supporting 
moslem brotherhood activists seeking to topple syrian president 
hafez assad 
the countries reconciled in 1979 after arabs joined together to 
oppose the camp david peace treaty between egypt and israel 
a year later relations were severed again when syria sided with 
iran in its war against iraq jordan was iraqs main backer 
when hussein patched up his relations with assad in 1985 he 
apologized for jordanian backing of the brotherhood and claimed it 
had been carried out without his knowledge by previous governments 
including badrans 
jordans relations with its powerful northern neighbor are 
lukewarm mainly because it opposes syrians military presence in 
lebanon 
as royal court chief badran was responsible for palace 
operations and served as a key political adviser to hussein the 
post has often been a stepping stone to the prime ministers office

the defense rested monday in the manslaughter trial 
of a miami policeman after rolling a motorcycle into the courtroom 
to show jurors how the vehicle looked the day the defendant shot 
and killed its driver 
the case could go to final arguments tuesday 
william lozano 31 a suspended officer faces two manslaughter 
counts in the january deaths of the bikes driver clement lloyd 
23 and passenger allan blanchard 24 both black lozano is 
colombian born the shooting triggered three days of racial 
violence in miami 
the prosecution claims lozano shot and killed lloyd 
unnecessarily as the kawasaki ninja superbike fleeing from a 
pursuing squad car sped past the officer in the opposite lane 
but the defense says the motorcycle was bearing down on lozano 
who shot in selfdefense on monday they rolled a 1988 ninja 
similar to lloyds into the courtroom over the prosecutors 
protests that the bike would look too large in an enclosed area 
defense attorney mark seiden had an expert testify about the 
cycles measurements to show the bullet could have entered lloyds 
head at a slight angle as the autopsy showed even if the bike 
was headed directly at the officer

a 16 million personal backruptcy plan for 
former ohio financier marvin l warner won court approval today 
after two years of wrangling but the government may appeal 
us bankruptcy judge george proctor said the internal revenue 
service would get about 13 million it is owed in yearly 
installments the government argued that the warner assets could be 
dissipated before the irs gets paid 
proctor cleared way for warners many creditors to begin 
collecting under chapter 11 bankruptcy rules whether or not there 
is a government appeal 
the judge harshly criticized warner 70 a former us 
ambassador to switzerland whose fortune crumbled after a bank he 
owned collapsed 
the judge noted that warner had come before the court in a 
jacksonville hearing sunday and criticized his creditors his 
lawyers and the courts 
he places the blame on many parties proctor said but i 
never once heard mr warner place the blame where it belongs and 
thats squarely on his own shoulders 
however the judge said he believed it was important for 
warner to have this plan approved he said it would get him out 
of the courts and restore some of his dignity 
i wish him no ill will the judge added 
warner lawyer scott alan orth said the issues in this case 
weighed heavily on the judges mind and he did what he could 
i think mr warner did take responsibility in this case he made 
mistakes but they were mistakes in litigation not in life 
warner promised sunday to deposit 6 million with the creditors 
committee to complete the plan then he said he would look for a 
little air and sunshine 
proctor on sunday also approved 36 million in fees to 
attorneys and accountants including pricewaterhouse which spent 
thousands of hours analyzing warners financial transactions since 
his home state savings bank in cincinnati collapsed in 1985 
the home state failure caused a crisis for 69 other ohio savings 
and loans whose deposits were insured by the ohio deposit guarantee 
fund 
warner filed for protection from creditors in october 1987 under 
federal bankruptcy law to halt 4 billion in claims against him 
the judge said todays hearing was needed to conclude arguments 
for the plan 
were anxious to rid ourselves of litigation warner said 
referring to the bank collapse that precipitated his bankruptcy 
filing my wife and i have fought this thing for five years we 
believe there is a little air and sunshine somewhere on this planet 
for us 
warner 70 who lives in ocala criticized the treatment he has 
received in court and the advice he has received from lawyers but 
the judge defended his actions 
im satisfied that he has received fair treatment before this 
court i make no apologies to mr warner or anyone else in this 
case proctor said 
warner had offered in november to pay creditors 175 million on 
the condition he be allowed to pursue lawsuits against the 
accounting firms grant thornton and arthur anderson amp co which 
had audited home state before the collapse 
he agreed to drop the proposed change and have the case 
converted from chapter 11 status to a chapter 7 liquidation after 
creditors refused to allow the case to be tied up in further 
lawsuits 
a jury in ohio found warner guilty in march 1987 on charges 
resulting from home states collapse warner was sentenced to 3 
years in prison but a state appellate court recently rejected the 
convictions ohio prosecutors plan to ask the state supreme court 
to reinstate the convictions 
ohio has spent 56 million prosecuting the case against warner 
and has made provisions to recover about 135 million as 
reimbursement for protecting home states depositors the thrift 
had about 14 billion in assets and served about 92000 
depositors it was sold and reopened in june 1985

president bush on monday endorsed a 
cautious and measured approach to reunifying germany instilling 
gratitude in west german chancellor helmut kohl but wariness among 
some other nato allies 
bush indicated at a special session of western alliance leaders 
that a single german state still loyal to nato would express the 
yearning of germans for unity as well as the right to a nations 
selfdetermination 
we are not trying to accelerate the process bush later told 
a news conference wrapping up his talks with allied leaders here 
its better to let things move on their own 
but his concept of a reunified germany within a future europe 
bound by common goals and values gave new life to an issue that 
stirs concern on both sides of the eastwest divide 
selfdetermination must be pursued without prejudice to its 
outcome bush told reporters in recapping his views on 
reunification 
he said west germany must remain committed to nato and the 
european community with due regard for the legal role and 
responsibilities of the allied powers and said reunification 
would have to be peaceful gradual and part of a stepbystep 
basis 
he said he thought kohl feels comfortable with the us 
terms on rejoining the two germanys and stressed that no time 
frame has been identified for reunification 
kohl expressed thanks for bushs support on those questions of 
concern to us germans 
the german question dominated and intensified the alliance 
gathering called to discuss the weekend summit in malta with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev which also dwelled heavily on the 
democratic reform wave eroding europes political divide 
the changes reshaping eastern europe most directly affect the 
germans who have been separated since world war ii into the rival 
camps of nato and the warsaw pact 
kohl spelled out his own 10point plan for reunification before 
the special nato gathering and complained that some allies have 
rejected it without study 
people outside germany are speaking of these plans without 
even having read them the chancellor said declining to name the 
nato leaders who oppose the quest for reunification 
we are most grateful to the us president for having shown 
understanding and offered support for our position as germans 
kohl said he also did so at malta 
in contrast british prime minister margaret thatcher appeared 
at her postsummit briefing to be clearly perturbed by elements of 
bushs address though she did not specify the subject of german 
reunification 
we must continue nato with present borders because to do 
anything else would be to jeopardize the security that we seek a 
british source who did not want to be named quoted mrs thatcher 
as telling the allies 
kohl suggested that jealous over german economic might could be 
at the root of the opposition 
west germany with its economic power is already too strong 
for the liking of many the chancellor said pointedly 
the combined german nations would have a population of nearly 80 
million with which to fuel the economic locomotive that has already 
made west germany the biggest exporting nation in the world and the 
wealthiest per capita according to some measures 
if we had this same discussion in 1982 when our economic 
situation was completely different than that which exists in west 
germany today the discussion would not have been so difficult 
kohl said making clear there was a debate over the unity plan 
kohl sought to allay fears that a reunified germany would pose 
any threat to either the nato alliance or the stability of europe 
he attempted to draw a distinction between the concept of 
inviolable borders and untouchable borders 
the 1976 helsinki act ensures the inviolability of presentday 
european borders which opponents of reunification contend rules 
out the recarving of a single germany from the two currently 
existing 
kohl argued that border revisions of mutual consent between two 
states are a matter of selfdetermination another of the 
rights recognized among the nato allies and countries signing the 
helsinki accords 
kohl reiterated bonns promise that it seeks reunification in a 
stepbystep manner consistent with the european process that seeks 
disarmament and erasure of military and political divisions 
gorbachevs call for a common european home is that which we 
also speak of in the process of reunification kohl said 
everything we do in germany is embedded in the development of 
europe overall 
bush said the emergence of a single german state would pose no 
problem as long as west germany stands by its commitments to the 
nato alliance and the european community 
and kohl vowed that those principles are part of the bedrock of 
west german policy 
solution of the german question is only possible under a 
european roof the chancellor said 
attempting to convince some wary allies that west germany is 
devoted to assisting the whole of eastern europe in its drive for 
democracy the chancellor noted that his government has established 
a billiondollar relief fund for poland and that his visit to 
hungary next week will provide aid for that reformist nation as 
well 
but he conceded that understandably the developments in east 
germany have distracted attention from developments in poland and 
hungary among west germans

president bush said monday its too 
early to proclaim an end to the cold war but added that mikhail s 
gorbachevs acceptance of sweeping reform in eastern europe 
absolutely mandates new thinking by the west 
wrapping up his weekend summit journey with a stop at nato 
headquarters bush also told reporters the united states would 
maintain significant military forces in europe as long as our 
allies desire our presence 
the president said he wants a treaty making initial cuts in 
superpowers conventional forces in europe in the bank before 
seeking deeper reductions he told nato leaders he hoped a 
multinational summit could be convened in europe next summer to 
sign such an accord 
conventional forces aside the united states and soviet union 
are negotiating a proposed 50 percent cut in longrange nuclear 
weapons as well as a proposed ban of chemical weapons 
bush was in a buoyant mood as he neared the end of a journey 
that took him to last weekends summit with gorbachev 
asked if it hadnt been risky to venture out in a small boat in 
the stormtossed harbor in malta during the weekend he replied 
hot dogging no you know these charismatic macho visionary 
guys theyll do anything 
the president bush spoke as gorbachev was convening a meeting of 
a radically reordered warsaw pact in moscow to review the weekend 
summit 
the superpower leaders agreed at an unprecedented joint news 
conference before leaving malta that their meeting heralded a new 
era of cooperation in eastwest relations including arms control 
and trade they intend to meet again in the united states in the 
second half of june 
at his news conference bush said we stand at the threshold 
of a new era but declined to assert the cold war has ended as 
gorbachev suggested 
that day hasnt arrived the president said when asked about 
gorbachevs statement declaring an end to the epoch of the cold 
war 
barring a utopian development bush said the united states 
must stay involved by keeping troops massed against warsaw pact 
forces 
if you want to project out 100 years or take some years off 
of that you can look to a utopian day when there might be none 
us troops in europe he said but as i pointed out to them 
nato leaders that day hasnt arrived and they agree with me 
the president began his news conference with a statement that 
said a peaceful revolution was taking place in eastern europe 
where five hard line communist regimes have fallen in recent weeks 
he said his goal was to see individual freedom everywhere 
replace coercion and tyranny 
bush apparently referring to disagreements about central 
america said all was not sweetness and light at the malta 
summit but took pains to applaud gorbachevs handling of the 
change in eastern europe 
as i watched the way in which mr gorbachev has handled the 
changes in eastern europe it deserves new thinking it absolutely 
mandates new thinking he said 
asked what had emerged at the summit he said i think he took 
my measure and i took his and i think we both feel more comfortable 
about our common objectives 
he said gorbachev was determined and unemotional in their 
private talks the soviet leader seemed very much in control 
and very confident in discussing without notes a wide array of 
subjects with me 
bush said some allied nations seek deeper cuts in conventional 
forces than are being considered in the vienna talks but he said 
they viewed the rapidity of change differently than we do 
and yet bush registered a renewed personal determination to 
realize completion of the treaty next year between nato and the 
warsaw pact that would cut us troops by 30000 and the soviets by 
325000 to an equal level of 275000 
the two alliances armories of tanks artillery and other 
nonnuclear weapons also are due to be cut back in a grand scheme 
to reduce tensions from the atlantic ocean across the vast expanse 
of europe to the ural mountains in the soviet union 
lets get it done bush said he told reporters i as 
president of the united states will kick the bureaucracy to get it 
done 
negotiators working on the accord in the austrian capital are 
making brisk progress but several issues are unresolved most 
significantly a dispute over the kind of soviet airplanes to be 
scrapped 
in addition bush said he was hopeful the west could take steps 
to ease soviet economic woes we want to try to meet him on some 
of the areas where he needs help im thinking of a few suggestions 
i had in the economic area he said 
but i also believe that the west must remain strong and 
together and try to be helpful where we can in a united way but 
not be imprudent he said 
dutch foreign minister hans van der broek said bush reported to 
the nato leaders that gorbachev had accepted the multination 
summit proposal for next year 
the importance of this is that it indicates both bush and 
gorbachev want to make an effort to reach such an agreement next 
year the dutch official told reporters 
also at the nato session bush outlined his policy on german 
reunification it rejected a timetable even though us ambassador 
vernon a walters on sunday had predicted a merger of east and west 
germany within five years 
bush said he favored a step by step approach that also 
maintained west german membership in nato 
but bush in line with his campaign not to alarm gorbachev or to 
assume an aggressive role in europe said i am not trying to 
accelerate that process 
even so officials announced that bush was sending secretary of 
state james a baker iii to germany next week for a symbolic visit 
to the berlin wall a symbol of the cold war that has been opened 
to free travel

americas nato allies monday welcomed 
president bushs determination to keep strong military links to 
western europe despite the diminishing security threat posed by the 
soviet union 
british prime minister margaret thatcher though appeared to 
have qualms about some of the presidents remarks in which bush 
raised the possibility of greater arms cuts in europe and even 
closer ties among the european community nations 
she said that bushs speech to leaders of the 16nation north 
atlantic treaty organization was so full of meat that we really 
should consider it very carefully before we reply to it 
others were not so hesitant 
dutch prime minister ruud lubbers said he was impressed by the 
united states extraordinarily positive attitude toward events 
in europe 
it has nothing to do with a we are pulling out attitude 
he told reporters on the contrary they are again promising a 
meaningful presence in europe 
belgian officials said it was obvious that the president took 
europe seriously 
just last week defense secretary dick cheney was at nato 
headquarters trying to dispel fears that the united states would 
unilaterally pull its troops out of europe because of budget 
deficit pressures and reduced eastwest tensions 
bush too went out of his way to reassure the allies after 
giving them an account of his weekend talks with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev in malta 
i pledge today that the united states will maintain 
significant military forces in europe as long as our allies desire 
our presence as part of a common security effort bush told the 
allies during a closeddoor meeting his remarks were later 
released by the white house 
the us will remain a european power he said that means 
the us will stay engaged in the future of europe and in our 
common defense 
mrs thatcher said his reassurance was a key outcome of the 
meeting 
reports of american plans to slash military spending in coming 
years have raised concern about the united states future ties to 
its european allies 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney said there was no 
question of withdrawing his countrys forces from europe nato 
provides a security link between the two north american nations and 
those in western europe 
the officials stressed natos importance during the dizzying 
pace of political and economic reforms in some of the countries of 
the sovietled warsaw pact the east blocs military alliance 
mulroney said nato was more relevant now than ever 
it offers both security and stability said mrs thatcher 
belgian prime minister wilfried martens agreed it has an 
essential role to play at a time of change 
in his speech bush put special emphasis on negotiations between 
nato and the warsaw pact to slash conventional or nonnuclear 
arms in europe last may bush offered a sweeping plan to reduce 
those weapons and set a oneyear deadline for negotiating a treaty 
we have made good progress since then he said but too 
little and too slowly to take full advantage of the opportunity 
before us the chance to ease the soviet army out of eastern europe 
and substantially reduce the risk of surprise attack and 
aggression 
he warned the other leaders that the arms bargaining could be 
overrun by events that could be dangerous and we must avoid it 
he said he was prepared to look with an open mind at ways in 
which we can together achieve even lower levels of conventional and 
nuclear forces in europe as part of a negotiated agreement 
the president urged the 12 nations of the european community 
trading bloc to press ahead maybe even intensify efforts to 
become more closely bound the nations are trying to dismantle 
trade barriers to create a single europeanwide market by the end 
of 1992 
bush said the community also should play a role as a magnet 
that draws the forces of reform forward in eastern europe 
his remarks touched on sensitive topics for mrs thatcher 
she has urged a more cautious attitude than some of the allies 
toward the events unfolding in eastern europe 
she also has been isolated from other common market members over 
plans for a tight economic and monetary union that would lead to a 
common currency and europeanwide central bank system the 
community holds a summit later this week in strasbourg france to 
thrash out these issues 
mrs thatcher insisted she did not feel left out of the nato 
talks time after time the word caution came up she said 
turmoil can be very disturbing she said and we dont 
know what may happen 
she said the reform paths embarked on by the east european 
governments were difficult its easier to demand freedom than it 
is to set a structure of freedom in place she said 
lubbers said the bush administration was not at all fearful of 
the possibilities of rapprochement in europe and of the european 
healing process 
they obviously see it as a very positive adventure he said

ordinary east germans are glad the old order 
is gone and seem to feel its been worth the risk even though they 
worry about an uncertain future 
right now the situation is nothing but chaos said michael 
scholz 24 one of dozens of east berliners interviewed one day 
after the communist party chief egon krenz and the entire party 
leadership resigned 
no one knows whats up said thomas fieberlkorn that 
those involved in the corruption are gone is good but what comes

east germany has serious economic problems intensified by the 
mass exodus to west germany of nearly 300000 people most of them 
young skilled workers 
in 40 years of communism east germany attained a relatively 
high standard of living compared with other soviet bloc countries 
but its industry is outdated and the communications network near 
collapse 
business was done as usual monday on leipziger street a broad 
shopping avenue but the resignations and reports of widespread 
corruption under the old guard krenzs people replaced were on 
peoples minds

who are still going there are doing it just for material things we 
have to stay here and rebuild out economy 
to do that we will need foreign investments we know there 
will be many problems but i have never given a thought to leaving 
here ms boettger works at an export company 
heike nestler said officials found guilty of corruption should 
be punished severely because they obtained their luxury at our

the lack of freedom she said

disappointment

just days before the sovietamerican summit 
meeting a soviet vessel left leningrad for nicaragua carrying four 
helicopters with potential military use bush administration 
sources said monday 
the reported shipment due to arrive in corinto nicaragua on 
dec 18 comes as the sandinista army is staging a substantial 
buildup in northern nicaragua not far from base camps of the contra 
rebels in southern honduras 
while some officials expressed concern about the potential 
military impact of the mi17 helicopters they said the soviets are 
likely to contend the aircraft are for commercial purposes 
because such aircraft normally are sent to nicaragua without 
weapons mounted on them the delivery would not appear to 
contradict the reaffirmation sunday by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev that his country has ceased arms deliveries to central 
america 
but the sources who asked not to be identified said the mi17 
has been used extensively by the sandinista armed forces for 
carrying troops and as gunships in the past they said mi17s 
have been converted on arrival in nicaragua for military use 
against the contras 
president bush has said he does not challenge gorbachevs 
assertions but has expressed concern about what he has descibed as 
a continuing flow of soviet bloc weaponry through nicaragua to 
leftist rebels in el salvador 
at his news conference in brussels on monday bush acknowldged 
that he and gorbachev have big differences on central america 
he said he would like gorbachev to use his influence to 
facilitate democratic change in the western hemisphere 
the sources said the sandinistas now have about 38 mi17s in 
their inventory the mi17 is an advanced version of the mi8 
helicopter and is more easily adaptable than the mi8 for use as a 
gunship 
since there are already many mi17s in nicaragua one official 
said the new shipment could not necessarily be considered a 
provocation the official said the sandinistas already have enough 
mi17s and described the additional helicopters as unnecessary 
he added that the delivery probably had been in the planning 
stage for months and that it may have been a coincidence that the 
ship carrying the helicopters left leningrad just before the 
mediterranean summit 
the us officials citing intelligence reports said the 
shipment left leningrad aboard the vessel vladimir ilyich 
the mi17 delivery to nicaragua as us officials see it 
appears to be more closely related to the internal situation in 
that country than to el salvador 
national elections are set for feb 25 and the sandinista 
government is angry that the contra rebels continue to operate not 
only inside nicaragua but also remain deployed at base camps in 
honduras 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega and four other central 
american presidents called in august for the demobilization of the 
rebels by this tuesday but that deadline will pass with the 
resistance forces still intact 
the contras backed by the bush administration have pointed out 
that the central american presidents specified that the 
demobilization must be voluntary and carried out only if the 
rebels can return safely to their homeland 
five weeks ago ortega suspended a truce that had been in effect 
for 19 months accusing the rebels of engaging in terrorist 
activities the contras who continue to receive nonlethal us 
aid said the only offensive action during the truce period had 
been carried out by the sandinista army 
aggravating the situation was the collapse on nov 21 of 
ceasefire talks in washington between the sandinistas and the 
contras

a federal appeals court on monday upheld 
san franciscos agreement to hire and promote women and minorities 
in the white maledominated fire department 
in a 30 ruling the 9th us circuit court of appeals rejected 
a union claim that the plan violated the rights of white men by 
setting numerical goals for minority and female employment and by 
requiring the promotion of 33 minority firefighters 
the agreement approved in a consent decree by us district 
judge marilyn hall patel in june 1988 is fundamentally fair 
adequate and reasonable said the opinion by judge david thompson 
the court noted the department had no blacks until 1955 and no 
women until 1987 and the citys hiring and promotional tests for 
firefighters had repeatedly been found discriminatory from 1970 to 
1987 
thompson said the decree met the standards for race and 
sexbased remedies set by the supreme court a manifest 
imbalance between representation of groups in the fire department 
and the population and the fashioning of a plan that does not 
unnecessarily hurt whites and males 
the decree which ended 18 years of lawsuits by minorities and 
women was challenged by firefighters union local 798 with the 
support of the reagan administration 
as the litigation neared a climax a swastika was found in the 
office of two minority firefighters in december 1987 patel 
pronounced the department out of control and ordered top 
officials to enforce rules against racial and sexual harassment 
under threat of contempt of court shortly afterward fire chief ed 
phipps resigned 
the appeals court upheld patels order in mondays ruling 
saying there was ample evidence of footdragging by the 
department in enforcing its rules against harassment 
when the decree on hiring and promotions was signed the 
department had 225 minorities and seven women on its staff of 1100 
the plan sets longterm goals of 40 percent minorities and 10 
percent women in the department and goals of 55 percent minority 
hiring and 10 percent female hiring through 1994 
the appeals court ordered the plan modified to eliminate the 
hiring standards before 1994 if the longterm goals were met by 
then 
the plan also requires the city to prepare new unbiased 
examinations for hiring and promotion and to promote 33 minority 
firefighters to the rank of lieutenant an additional 48 promotions 
are optional of which 12 must be minorities 
thompson rejected the unions argument that the plan was 
discriminatory by requiring the promotion of minorities but not of 
whites no evidence was presented of past discrimination against 
whites he said

the party is now incapable of action in a deep crisis and 
has lost the trust of its supporters its members and the people 
in the german democratic republic he said 
west germany has a responsibility to help in humanitarian 
areas regardless of the events in the communist party he

premier hans modrow a reformer who is emerging as the countrys 
main political figure the kohl aide indicated he also might speak 
with members of modrows cabinet which includes some 
noncommunists 
west germany has proposed establishing a hardcurrency fund for 
east germans who use their new travel freedom to visit the west 
east germanys currency is nonconvertible making it difficult for 
east germans to buy goods in the west 
so far east germany has not been willing to meet bonns demand 
that in exchange it stop requiring west germans to pay 25 marks 
13 each time they enter east germany 
west germany also wants the east german government to contribute 
substantially to the proposed fund

the leftist political 
opposition and humanitarian groups labeled as subversive for 
working with the poor have been driven underground or out of the 
country by a climate of persecution 
eileen rosin the sole representative of the los angelesbased 
medical aid for el salvador left the country monday after 
discovering her office was ransacked over the weekend 
neighbors said about 20 men in military uniforms entered it 
before dawn saturday 
for eight years medical aid has distributed money for 
prosthetic devices delivered donated medicines to hospitals and 
sent dozens of children to the united states for operations beyond 
the technical means of salvadoran hospitals 
ms rosin 35 had worked in el salvador for two years and left 
reluctantly for los angeles 
we had two little girls lined up for heart operations in the 
states i dont know what will happen to them now she said 
the united nations on friday said it will transfer its 
salvadoran offices to guatemala for lack of guarantees 
officials found equipment and furniture at the main un offices 
smashed following fighting last week around the building in the 
affluent neighborhood of escalon 
army troops had occupied the offices which administered unicef 
and refugee projects after un personnel were evacuated when 
un officials returned they found scrawled on the walls un 
equals fmln equals traitors 
the letters stand for farabundo marti national liberation front 
the rebel group that last month launched its biggest offensive of 
the 10yearold civil war 
the usbacked government of rightist alfredo cristiani 
responded by declaring a state of siege that suspended 
constitutional guarantees 
hundreds of people have been detained since including two dozen 
foreigners who work with churches or humanitarian groups almost 
all the nonsalvadorans have been deported although some remain 
jailed facing charges 
foreigners who work with the poor are called 
internationalists and they are a favorite target of the right 
which accuses them of supporting revolution 
a flier signed salvadoran air force considered the most 
rightist branch of the armed forces was found strewn on city 
streets over the weekend 
with god reason and might we shall conquer it said 
salvadoran patriot you have every right to defend your life and 
your property if in order to do this you have to kill fmln 
terrorists and their internationalist allies do it 
we are in the catacombs there is no prospect for aboveground 
humanitarian work with the poor in the short or middle term said 
episcopalian rev luis serrano whose church has for years done 
social medical and educational work with displaced people and 
refugees 
he commented in an interview in mariona prison where he and 
eight members of his church are jailed as alleged subversives 
secretary of state james a baker iii has said the crackdown by 
the government and armed forces was absolutely appropriate 
washington has provided 4 billion in aid this decade to the 
salvadoran government in the war which has killed 71000 people 
1000 of them in the latest fighting 
us ambassador william walker likened the raids and arrests to 
the internment of japaneseamericans during world war ii 
im not condoning it but in times like these of great emotion 
and great anger things like this happen even in the us with 
all its guarantees it happened walker said 
there are a series of indications of a climate of 
persecution said monsignor gregorio rosa chavez auxiliary 
bishop of san salvador after mass on sunday not only against 
personnel of the catholic church but against many people who try 
to help the most humble and the most poor 
it appears that the military authorities in their quest to 
restore order have adopted as their criteria the saying think 
the worst and youll be right he said 
the climate of war and fear has tinged even jokes one goes like 
this 
two soldiers are patrolling the streets 10 minutes before the 
beginning of the nightly curfew they pass a man walking quickly in 
the opposite direction one soldier turns around and fatally shoots 
the man 
whyd you do that asks his companion

the last obstacle between leona helmsley and 
sentencing was lifted monday when a judge refused to set aside her 
tax evasion conviction 
mrs helmsley who is portrayed in advertisements as the queen 
of her luxury hotels was convicted aug 30 of evading 12 million 
in federal taxes by charging personal expenses to her business 
empire 
by denying a request to overturn the conviction and dismiss the 
charges us district judge john walker cleared the way for her 
dec 12 sentencing 
the judge ruled that prosecutors did not use tainted evidence 
against mrs helmsley mrs helmsleys lawyers based their request 
on allegations that prosecutors improperly used the testimony she 
gave to grand juries in 1985 
at the time the state was investigating possible sales tax 
evasion by jewelers furriers and other retailers because mrs 
helmsley was granted immunity prosecutors were legally barred from 
using the testimony in the later income tax case 
the court is satisfied that the governments evidence used in 
the federal grand jury and at trial was derived from sources 
independent of mrs helmsleys immunized testimony on unrelated 
matters walker said in a written decision 
her attorney gerald feffer said he had not seen walkers 
decision and could not comment 
at sentencing the 69yearold mrs helmsley could receive 
punishment ranging from community service to 127 years in prison if 
walker imposes consecutive sentences on 33 taxrelated counts she 
also could face more than 7 million in fines 
mrs helmsleys 80yearold husband harry heads a 5 billion 
real estate and hotel empire he was charged with his wife and the 
others but was found incompetent to stand trial

a court affirmed monday that a 
palestinian facing charges of murder is also a suspect in the 
bombing of pan am flight 103 and it approved the seizure of 
evidence in a raid on his apartment 
mohammed abu talb 35 is believed to be the first suspect to 
face a court proceeding in connection with the bombing of the jumbo 
jet dec 21 1988 over lockerbie scotland that killed 270 people 
the court finds that abu talb is suspected in scotland of 
murder or as an accessory to murder the brief district court 
ruling said 
clothing seized in the raid can be presumed to carry 
importance for the investigation it said 
the court classified its hearing records as secret and ordered 
any evidence removed from sweden to be returned when the 
investigation is completed abu talb listed in court documents as 
abo talb appeared at a closed hearing friday 
a verdict in the case of abu talb and three other palestinians 
is expected dec 21 their trial ended nov 15 on charges of murder 
and attempted murder in four bombings in copenhagen amsterdam and 
stockholm in 1985 and 1986 
jamila mograbi who is divorced from abu talb but still lives 
with him denied he was involved in the pan am bombing but would 
not discuss the other charges 
we are short of money its obvious that my husband is not 
some kind of terrorist because terrorists have money she told 
the associated press 
abu talb is a former member of the palestine popular struggle 
front a group based in syria that rejects compromise with israel 
and opposes yasser arafat chief of the palestine liberation 
organization 
ahmed jibrils radical popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command is the group most often accused of the 
pan am attack 
ms mograbi said three scottish detectives and seven swedish 
officers searched the apartment last week for clothing traceable to 
malta in the mediterranean virtually emptying the closets and 
filling 15 plastic bags she said 
under swedish law evidence cannot be taken for a foreign 
investigation or removed from the country unless a court 
authorizes it 
investigators are said to have identified clothing originating 
in malta from the suitcase they believe contained the bomb 
they believe the bomb may have gone on an air malta flight to 
frankfurt where the pan am 103 originated the flight changed 
planes in london and was bound for new york 
ms mograbi 28 said abu talb brought three sweaters and a pair 
of jeans from malta in october 1988 she said they were wholesale 
samples he intended to show retailers with the idea of importing 
such clothing 
abu talb was looking for a new business after his video store 
failed she said adding that he went to malta to recover from a 
stab wound suffered in a quarrel 
police arrested abu talb in may along with two of miss 
mograbis brothers and a fourth palestinian in connection with the 
four bombings 
even if you are suspected of one crime it doesnt mean you 
committed another she said in the interview monday 
according to court documents abu talb came to sweden in 1986 on 
a false moroccan passport miss mograbi said the couple has lived 
in sweden for six years 
court records say abu talb was born in lebanon served in the 
egyptian army underwent military training in the soviet union

in the first case of its kind the owner 
of a pit bull dog went on trial monday in the murder of a toddler 
mauled after wandering into the dogs path while prosecutors say 
it was guarding 243 marijuana plants 
jury selection began in santa clara county superior court for 
michael berry 39 of morgan hill berry is charged with 
seconddegree murder for the june 13 1987 death of his 2yearold 
neighbor james soto who died of severe blood loss after being 
attacked by the berrys pit bull named willy 
berry also faces felony marijuana cultivation charges 
according to the prosecutor and the humane society of the united 
states the trial marks the first time in this country that a pet 
owner has been charged with murder because of an animals actions 
deputy district attorney dale sanderson acknowledged there is no 
evidence of malice or intent to kill young soto but said the 
prosecution is based on the theory of implied malice that allows a 
murder conviction for someone whose actions show wanton disregard 
for human life 
what we have is a guy who raises a dog that is bred for 
aggressiveness and to be a combatant sanderson said during 
berrys arraignment two years ago and knowing the dogs 
propensity he places him in an area accessible to all including 
children 
during a search of berrys home authorities said they found 
several publications on illegal dog fighting and a dogsized 
conditioning treadmill 
a gag order was issued last month barring both sides from 
discussing the case 
james sotos father arthur said he and his wife had left james 
playing with new toy trucks on their back patio while they went 
shopping at garage sales when they returned the father said he 
found their son being torn apart by the pit bull after 
apparently wandering through an open gate and into the unfenced 
yard of their neighbor the child never regained consciousness 
at least 157 people have died from dog attacks nationwide in the 
past 10 years 70 percent of them under the age of 10 according to 
the national centers for disease control in atlanta 
but of those cases the humane society of the united states said 
only one owner has been convicted of a major felony hayward 
turnipseed of de kalb county ga was convicted of involuntary 
manslaughter and sentenced to five years in prison after three of 
his pit bulls killed a 4yearold boy in 1987 
berry has contended that he has been singled out because his dog 
attacked a child at a time when the breed was the center of 
considerable negative publicity 
i think a murder rap is overdoing it by a lot said sanford 
kadish a law professor at the university of california at 
berkeley if this is the highest form of crime then what do we 
do with the hired killer or the serial rapist 
kadish and other lega experts have speculated that berry was 
charged with seconddegree murder in an effort to force him to 
plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter instead 
berry faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted 
while berry goes on trial his dog willy remains at the santa 
clara animal shelter 
he has not been destroyed because he is considered evidence in 
the case and he is described as a friendly and affectionate dog 
but shelter spokeswoman stacy hill said willy nevertheless will be 
destroyed at the conclusion of the legal battle

the previously secret diary of writer and 
social critic hl mencken reveals virulent antisemitism racism 
and pronazi leanings shocking even the sympathetic mencken 
scholar who edited it 
the diary typewritten on 2100 pages from 1930 to 1948 was 
sealed on menckens instructions for 25 years after his death in 
1956 the baltimore evening sun where mencken once worked 
published excerpts monday 
on the subject of jews mencken wrote in december 1943 that the 
maryland club had decided against admitting any more jewish members 
after the only one on its rolls died there is no other jew in 
baltimore who seems suitable he said 
of blacks he wrote in september 1943 it is impossible to 
talk anything resembling discretion or judgment to a colored woman 
they are all essentially childlike and even hard experience does 
not teach them anything 
on oct 24 1945 he wrote that the course of the united 
states in world war ii was dishonest dishonorable and 
ignominious and the sunpapers in supporting roosevelts foreign 
policy shared in this disgrace 
the book the diary of hl mencken was edited by mencken 
scholar charles a fecher of baltimore and published by alfred a 
knopf 
mencken is revered by many writers and journalists for his 
erudite writing and often brilliant social and political criticism 
the national press club in washington has a library named in his 
honor and the baltimore sun bestows an annual writing award named 
for him 
he spent 40 years at the evening sun edited the smart set and 
the american mercury magazines wrote dozens of books and 
contributed to numerous other publications 
his feelings about world war ii are incredible in a man of his 
intelligence knowledge and perception fecher wrote in his 
introduction to the book he seems to have had no conception at 
all of what a germanjapanese victory would have meant to the 
civilized world or to the liberties that he himself so cherished 
menckens attitude toward blacks was a curious mingling of 
total egalitarianism and patronizing superiority fecher 
wrote 
mencken regularly published black writers in american mercury 
persuaded his publisher alfred a knopf to publish their books 
was cordial to black journalists and had his portrait painted by a 
black artist 
the last article he wrote for the evening sun in 1948 attacked 
segregation laws in baltimore 
but the diary reveals menckens deeply ingrained conviction 
that black people were by their very nature inferior to white 
fecher wrote 
fecher said the writers own words may permanently diminish his 
reputation 
like everybody else who is going to read it i was shocked 
said fecher 72 it has tempered my admiration for mencken and 
made me aware of weaknesses i had not known 
fecher defended mencken against charges of antisemitism in his 
1978 book mencken a study of his thought 
today i would be much less ready to take such a stand let it 
be said at once clearly and unequivocally mencken was an 
antisemite wrote fecher 
menckens diary tells of his pleasure that a north carolina 
resort he enjoyed visiting excludes jews and expresses annoyance 
when jews moved into his neighborhood 
his closest associates at the baltimore newspapers revered his 
memory but he dismisses virtually all of them as third raters 
nonentities and worse 
the diaries are almost sick i mean he hated everybody said 
gwinn owens a former editor and columnist on the evening sun whose 
father hamilton owens was a longtime sunpapers editor and friend 
of menckens 
in the diary mencken dismisses owens as a timeserver with no 
more principles than a privy rat 
one of the things that really hurts is that after mencken 
had his stroke my father went to see him every week sat with him 
and talked with him gwinn owens said

us economists and business leaders expressed 
general support monday for president bushs actions at the malta 
summit to support soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
perestroika restructuring efforts 
malta is a longrun affair with all kinds of great promise 
said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co one should be 
cautious but there are great hopes and optimism that a new era is 
dawning 
dwayne o andreas chief executive of the agricultural giant 
archerdanielsmidland co of decatur ill said that unleashing 
the forces of freeenterprise cant be anything but beneficial 
the analysts were asked their views of bushs statements and 
actions of recent days in connection with gorbachevs efforts to 
revamp an ailing economy 
bush lent encouragement to that effort but during a news 
conference in brussels belgium monday following his briefing of 
nato leaders bush said chances were slim and none that 
gorbachev would be invited to join the worlds seven richest 
countries at their economic summit meeting next july 
bush said the soviets need to do much more to reform their 
governmentcontrolled economic system before they could be 
considered for inclusion in the annual economic summits attended by 
the united states japan west germany britain france canada and 
italy 
the next meeting is scheduled for early july in houston 
gorbachev had sent a letter to the world leaders at last summers 
meeting in paris asking to be included in the annual talks 
but bush told reporters he did not think it likely that the 
soviets would be participating in next years summit saying he saw 
two chances slim and none for that particular meeting 
bush said that what was most important now was for communist 
countries trying to transform their economies to get expertise in 
how marketbased systems work 
we have got to understand gorbachevs dilemma they have not 
had a market economy bush said it is important that not just 
the soviet union but other countries in eastern europe understand 
the market economies understand the dynamism of the economic 
systems that join the seven economic summit countries together 
the president announced several initiatives at his weekend 
meeting with gorbachev aimed at helping to integrate the soviet 
union into the world economy he pledged to remove high us 
tariffs levied on soviet imports once the soviets approve 
legislation allowing free emigration he also promised to support 
observer status for the soviet union in the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade the 97member international organization that 
governs world trade 
observer status would not automatically entitle the soviet union 
to various favorable trade concessions granted full gatt members 
but it would provide soviet officials with firsthand knowledge of 
the deliberations occurring in the organization 
the united states had previously opposed soviet requests for 
observer status maintaining that the soviet system was 
incompatible with gatts freetrade principles 
andreas said that bushs promise to lower tariffs on soviet 
goods following approval of the liberalized emigration law should 
foster reciprocal actions by the soviets to purchase more american 
goods including farm products 
before the farm trade restrictions imposed by thenpresident 
jimmy carter in retaliation for the red army invasion of 
afghanistan american farmers supplied 70 percent of the 
agricultural products imported by the soviet union the us share 
of the soviet agricultural market is now 45 percent 
david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill said that it was 
essential for bush to provide some specific proposals to bolster 
the reforms gorbachev is trying to institute in the soviet union 
if perestroika fails it is going to fail because of 
economics wyss said we have much to lose by the russians 
failing we should be helping them any way we can

the st louis sun has grabbed more than 
100000 readers a day in its first two months of publication but 
hasnt drawn readers away from the established st louis 
postdispatch executives of the two newspapers said monday 
in fact postdispatch officials sounded almost grateful to the 
upstart sun which is the newest newspaper in the country 
i do firmly believe that the postdispatch is a much better 
newspaper today than it was a year ago nicholas penniman iv 
publisher of the postdispatch and vice president of the pulitzer 
publishing co said at an annual editors meeting 
david lipman managing editor of the postdispatch said the new 
competition has accelerated changes that were in the works at the 
111yearold newspaper and given it a jolt of adrenalin 
the postdispatch feels 10 years younger and were going to 
continue feeling young and being useful and still be a lot of 
fun he said 
the sun which debuted sept 25 has been averaging about 
107000 circulation for its first two months while the 
postdispatchs circulation has remained steady at 378000 daily 
and 565000 on sunday 
the postdispatchs saturday newspaper has increased its 
circulation about 3 percent to 348000 since the sun began 
appearing with an expanded saturday paper that costs 1 compared to 
25 cents for the saturday postdispatch 
ralph ingersoll ii the suns editorinchief and chairman of 
its parent company ingersoll publications co said he expected 
the sun to turn a profit by the end of 1990 
however he said profits wont be as high as originally 
projected because the newspaper is attracting more home subscribers 
and fewer newsstand buyers than expected home subscribers pay less 
ingersoll brushed aside talk of a newspaper war in st louis 
we look on it as a competition which is something different 
than a war he said 
before the debut of the sun the postdispatch had been without 
competition since the st louis globedemocrat folded in oct 1986

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev chided 
president bush at their malta summit for not granting visas to 
thousands of soviet citizens who want to live in the united states 
a soviet spokesman said monday 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said on the 
flight back to moscow that bush raised the human rights issue by 
giving gorbachev a list of divided spouses the united states claims 
are separated by soviet refusal to grant one or the other an exit 
visa 
presentation of such lists thousands of names long until 
recently has been a ritual at highlevel meetings for years the 
lists have shrunk steadily under gorbachev however and only a few 
people are on the latest one 
when bush presented it during talks on the soviet cruise ship 
maxim gorky gerasimov said we had a very long list of soviet 
citizens who want to go to the united states and cant get visas 
which is a little bit against the universal declaration of human 
rights 
gerasimov told reporters later he was joking about the soviets 
giving bush a list but said gorbachev did respond to the us 
presentation by reminding bush that thousands of soviets seeking 
visas line up outside the us embassy in moscow every day 
the united states inundated by the flood of people now being 
allowed to emigrate has drastically limited the number given 
refugee status as victims of persecution and expects to turn away 
200000 in the next year 
soviet officials have estimated 45 million citizens will leave 
the country under a new law permitting the departure of most people 
who want to leave 
gerasimov said bush had offered to begin negotiations on a trade 
agreement without waiting for congressional approval of 
mostfavorednation status which the soviets have been denieed 
because they prevented free emigration 
he said the soviet side reacted very favorably to bushs 
proposal for halting production of binary chemical weapons 
gerasimov called it an important initiative one step in the 
right direction toward a comprehensive chemical weapons ban 
to illustrate soviet concern about being surrounded by us 
military forces gorbachev gave bush a classified map showing the 
american bases that ring soviet territory gerasimov said 
the kremlin is preparing to publish more information about its 
military spending and production he said 
we promised under no circumstances ever to attack the united 
states he added and feel america doesnt need all this 
military hardware

valley hezbollah fighters drove amal from three villages in 
housetohouse combat police said 
police said at least 15 people were killed and 48 wounded in the 
two flareups 
hezbollah or party of god is comprised of proiranian 
fundamentalists mainstream amal is allied with syria the two 
shiite moslem factions long have vied for control of the 12 
million shiites the largest sect among lebanons 4 million 
population

michel aoun of blocking a settlement of the 14yearold lebanese 
civil war but urged the christian commander and syria to avoid a 
new battle 
president elias hrawi said monday he was delaying for a few days 
any decisive action to evict aoun from the presidential palace in 
baabda east of beirut 
the arab league appeal came after a twoday meeting of its 
committee on lebanon 
aoun rejects a peace plan worked out at taif saudi arabia in 
october and approved by the lebanese parliament he also says 
hrawis election by parliament last month was unconstitutional 
his 20000 christian army troopers fought a sixmonth artillery 
war with the 40000 syrian soldiers stationed in lebanon which 
ended in september with a truce arranged by the arab league 
the syrians moved in additional troops tanks and heavy 
artillery but the united states the soviet union the vatican and 
former colonial power france urged syria to show moderation and 
counseled dialogue to resolve the crisis 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran messaged syrian 
foreign minister farouk alsharaa reiterating irans support for 
syria and denouncing michel aouns ruffianism the islamic 
republic news agency said monday

council of the ongoing massacre in south lebanon 
a foreign ministry statement said lebanon reserved the right to 
ask a council debate on the brutal attacks by israel and its 
surrogates in south lebanon 
israel set up the zone in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its 
forces after occupying lebanon for three years the area varies in 
depth from 6 to 10 miles and is meant to serve as a buffer against 
crossborder guerrilla raids 
amal fought hezbollah at sohmor and yohmor in the western sector 
of the bekaa valley north of the security zone

transportation secretary samuel skinner 
predicted monday that random drug testing will reveal an alarming 
amount of drug usage among people responsible for the safety of 
land air and sea transportation 
rules begin going into effect in two weeks that require random 
and other drug tests for millions of airline railroad mass 
transit bus company boat trucking company and pipeline employees 
skinner said that where court orders do not stop the testing 
companies must comply with the new rule several suits have been 
filed by workers to stop the federally imposed program startup 
dates for the testing vary by modes of transportation 
the secretary said he has set up a group in his office to 
monitor progress of the testing while agencies dealing with 
aviation railroads and other modes would each oversee industries 
they cover 
once they begin the testing i think well see an alarming 
amount of drug use and positive testing in safetyrelated jobs 
said skinner at a session with reporters 
he said he expects the results to justify the high priority the 
administration has given the program 
random drug tests in the military showed high drug use in the 
first few months he said ten percent of tested coast guard 
personnel showed positive but the incidence has since dropped to 2 
percent because of the testing he said 
skinner said the government would not be lenient with companies 
that do not make an effort to begin drugtesting programs 
i dont want to be unfair he said but the time has come 
where weve got to move forward on this testing were not going to 
sit here and tell somebody who is required by law or regulation to 
conduct the test that they can just wait until they are ready 
possible action against employers including civil penalties or 
withholding of federal funds varies by transportation modes 
skinner said that with rare exception airlines have 
submitted drugtesting plans that have been approved the federal 
aviation administration extended the august deadline after several 
smaller airlines failed to submit their programs 
the secretary said he had been told by more than one mass 
transit operator to expect high rates of drug usage when the 
testing begins possibly significantly higher than the 10 percent 
found in the coast guard 
results should vary in different parts of the country and in 
different modes of transportation skinner said but added i 
know its a major problem all over this country 
asked what effect high drug use might have on the continuation 
of transportation services skinner said if the percentages were 
40 percent it would be devastating if it were 5 percent they 
could probably work their way through it

sheet and rill erosion on cropland decreased 
by a half ton per acre nationwide between 1982 and 1987 dropping 
from 43 tons to 38 tons per acre a year the agriculture 
department said monday 
however wind erosion on cropland increased 01 ton per acre to 
33 tons per acre a year said the national resources inventory 
report from the departments soil conservation service 
according to the data sheet and rill erosion nationwide totals 
16 billion tons per year and wind erosion 14 billion tons 
annually 
the survey reveals impressive gains for soil conservation 
said the center for resource economics a washingtonbased 
nonprofit environmental research and publishing organization 
but the research also shows that soil erosion is still a serious 
problem it said in a statement released monday 
from everything we know about land use in the mid1970s 
erosion conditions worsened with the onset of the export boom 
said ken cook vice president of the center 
he said analysis of the survey data may show that the 
improvement in erosion control is due substantially to massive 
idling of cropland under government programs between 1984 and 1987 
the agriculture department said the report does not reflect the 
work under way on about 140 million acres of highly erodible land 
as part of the conservation provisions of the 1985 farm law 
rural nonfederal land now totals 14 billion acres of this 
4228 million acres are cropland 4017 million acres are 
rangeland 3944 million acres are forestland and 599 million aces 
are in minor land uses the survey says

idealistic military officers who are 
among the nations most talented have tried repeatedly to depose 
the president they helped elevate to power in february 1986 
they organized the reform the armed forces movement in 1985 to 
oppose corruption in the military under the late president 
ferdinand marcos who was driven into exile and replaced by corazon 
aquino 
of six coup attempts against mrs aquino they are known to have 
plotted those in november 1986 august 1987 and the past weekend 
the ram boys as they are known here have come to believe 
her administration represents the same nepotism and corruption as 
the marcos government 
on saturday they issued a manifesto demanding that mrs aquino 
resign to open the way for a referendum on what form the 
archipelagos government should take 
it accused her of pursuing the ruinous policies of her 
predecessors and of not initiating social and economic reform the 
ram officers have claimed mrs aquino favors leftists and coddles 
communist rebels while ignoring the interests of the armed forces 
ram emerged when officers unfurled a banner during graduation 
exercises at the philippine military academy saying we belong 
they were described as born again soldiers committed to 
restoring discipline and professionalism 
members include some of the best officers including former lt 
col gregorio gringo honasan a charismatic figure who led the 
coup attempt in august 1987 and is believed to be a leader of this 
one 
their political philosophy seems not unlike that of italian 
fascists in the 1920s society should exchange hurlyburly politics 
for an orderly disciplined approach to solving national problems 
mrs aquino prefers consultation and public debate that produces 
a consensus she can accept she tends to rely heavily on people 
whose primary qualification is loyalty to her or her husband 
benigno aquino jr who was shot to death when he returned from 
selfimposed exile in the united states 
robert lee a young ram lieutenant appeared on a commandeered 
television station during the august 1987 coup attempt to proclaim 
his movements goals he said philippine society suffered from 
too much politics endless debate without resolution 
the ram clique became associated with juan ponce enrile then 
defense minister because of mutual opposition to gen fabian ver 
military chief of staff to marcos 
ver a distant relative of marcos had circumvented the chain of 
command by his relationship with the president and his wife 
imelda and underminded enriles position as defense chief 
he had solidified his power by appointing supporters to senior 
commands regardless of merit so ram officers looked to enrile 
in 1985 as the marcos administration weakened ram officers 
began plotting to replace his government with a junta that would 
impose discipline and order on a chaotic society 
ram sources say they planned a coup for late 1985 but delayed 
it after marcos called a presidential election for february 1986 
when marcos used fraud to steal the election from mrs aquino 
ram issued a statement saying the will of the people had been 
foiled 
plans were made for a coup in which soldiers in rubber boats 
would cross the pasig river and storm the presidential palace but 
ver learned of the plot and ordered enrile and others arrested 
the defense minister found out and withdrew to military 
headquarters in camp aguinaldo with his boys and declared 
opposition to marcos 
his declaration did not win over enough units to assure success 
so enrile and lt gen fidel ramos then deputy chief of staff 
appealed to cardinal jaime sin and opposition groups 
hundreds of thousands of people heeded the cardinals call to 
fill the streets and protect the mutineers the price was a 
declaration from the military leaders of support for mrs aquino 
members of ram always have felt they were denied power that was 
rightfully theirs they risked careers families and lives to oust 
marcos but mrs aquino and her advisers many of them 
antimilitary got the rewards

the federal government has granted hundreds of 
airline pilots medical exemptions to fly but has not used similar 
exemptions to allow pilots to fly past the mandatory retirement age 
of 60 a congressional study released monday said 
rep edward r roybal dcalif who released the general 
accounting office study said the study reveals an inconsistency in 
federal aviation administration rules that he said have kept some 
of the most qualified and experienced pilots from operating large 
commercial airliners 
the report says the faa granted 1301 exemptions to requirements 
for medical certificates 1960 through 1988 it said that among the 
40000 active air transport pilots 605 now have special 
issuance medical certificates for alcoholism and 104 for 
cardiovascular conditions 
allowing such pilots to continue flying but excluding a 
60yearold pilot in perfect health clearly does not make sense 
said roybal the chairman of the house committee on aging 
the report said none of 67 petitions by 418 pilots asking for 
exemptions for pilots over 60 has been granted by the faa which 
has said it adopted the rule for safety some of the applications 
are still pending 
pilots over 60 can fly commercial jets with fewer than 30 
passengers and a payload under 7500 pounds but must retire as 
captains or copilots of large airliners 
roybal said the faa should reconsider the basis for its age60 
rule which went into effect in 1959 and has been challenged by 
pilot groups and others over the years 
the report by the gao which is congress investigative arm 
summarized legal challenges to the rule legislative efforts and

government not to investigate and try two prominent palestinians 
identified as uprising leaders by an israeli legislator and court 
documents officials said monday 
tzahi hanegbi the legislator alleged in a supreme court appeal 
that philosophy professor sari nusseibeh and the head of the arab 
journalists association radwan abu ayyash handled uprising funds 
and wrote leaflets urging escalation of the 2yearold rebellion 
hanegbi of prime minister yitzhak shamirs conservative likud 
bloc quoted documents submitted to a military court at lod in may 
that called nusseibeh a paymaster of the uprising in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip responsible for distributing plo funds 
and publishing uprising literature 
he claimed abu ayyash represented fatah the guerrilla group of 
yasser arafat the palestinie liberation organization chief in the 
underground unified national leadership of the uprising and was 
responsible for several leaflets army radio reported 
neither has been charged and hanegbi demanded both men be tried 
the national news agency itim reported 
nili arad of the state attorneys office attributed the decision 
not to investigate nusseibeh and abu ayyash to professional 
considerations itim and the radio reported 
she said defense minister yitzhak rabin police minister chaim 
barlev and other officials bore those considerations in mind 
according to the reports 
army radio said the security reasons remained secret but might 
be revealed if the court requested it 
abu ayyash said in a telephone interview i would love to know 
and understand what these considerations are but im not involved 
directly in these things so i dont see i should worry

allegations and the journalist declared i think that if the 
legal system in israel possesses information on security 
violations they wont hesitate to ask us for interrogation i have 
been interrogated many times whenever they suspect something 
against security 
nusseibeh characterized hanegbis allegations as vague and 
circumstantial he denied committing offenses or having knowledge 
of what the israeli considerations were 
regarding secret security reasons one is always at a loss 
concerning secret files of prosecutors he said one can never 
really tell what they have or do not have 
im glad of not being investigated or put on trial on the 
other hand im also quite prepared to face trial and to put 
forward my case and to defend myself using all the legal methods at 
my disposal 
some arab observers have speculated israel saw the two as 
possible candidates in its plan for palestinians in the territories 
to elect delegates to negotiate interim autonomy and therefore was 
hesistant to investigate them 
both the west bank and gaza were paralyzed monday by the second 
day of a general strike called because of an israeli army attack on 
a palestinian gang in the west bank city of nablus 
on friday israeli soldiers killed four members of a group

was arrested oct 10 on suspicion of trying to run over an israeli

the soviet union and four other warsaw pact 
nations that invaded czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush a reform 
movement condemned their action on monday 
for the first time the leaders of the soviet union bulgaria 
hungary east germany and poland said jointly that sending in 
troops constitituted interference in the internal affairs of a 
sovereign czechoslovakia and must be condemned according to a 
statement read on tv and carried by the official news agency tass 
in a separate statement the kremlin called the sovietled 
invasion unfounded and erroneous it noted that prague 
condemned it earlier 
the invasion used tanks to crush the prague spring reforms 
of alexander dubcek who was ousted as communist party leader in 
the past two weeks dubcek has reemerged in the prodemocracy 
movement sweeping czechoslovakia 
tass said the soviet and czechoslovak governments will begin 
talks on possible reduction of soviet troops still based in 
czechoslovakia 
the statements came at the end of a warsaw pact summit meeting 
in moscow where soviet president mikhail s gorbachev indicated 
the warsaw pact and its western foe nato will someday become 
political instead of military alliances 
mondays announcements came a day after gorbachev met president 
bush at malta 
for months following momentous political change in east europe 
all the signers of mondays announcement except the soviets 
condemned the invasion of their ally romania still run by 
hardliner nicolae ceausescu was not included in mondays 
statement but romania did not take part in the invasion 
the statement said interrupting the process of democratic 
renewal in czechoslovakia these unjustified actions had longterm 
negative consequences history proved that it is extremely 
important even in the most complex international situations to 
use political means for the settling of any problem to strongly 
observe principles of sovereignty independence and 
noninterference in internal affairs in relations between states 
in line with the principles of the warsaw pact 
the soviet announcement likened the situation in 1968 to the 
current political upheaval in czechoslovakia where demonstrations 
and a general strike have forced leadership changes the soviet 
statement called this a natural process of selfreassessment 
it said the soviet leadership supported one side in the internal 
dispute of 1968 and the justification for such an unbalanced 
inadequate approach an interference in the affairs of a friendly 
country was then viewed in an acute eastwest confrontation 
we share the view of the presidium of the central committee of 
the communist party of czechoslovakia and the czechoslovak 
government that the entrance of the armies of five socialist 
countries into czechoslovak territory in 1968 was unfounded and 
that that decision in the light of all the presently known facts 
was erroneous the soviet government announcement said 
the invasion stamped out reforms and restored a moscowaligned 
government of hardliners the late leonid i brezhnev then the 
soviet leader cited the warsaw pacts sacred duty to protect 
socialism wherever it was threatened 
albania quit the alliance to protest the invasion and has 
remained isolated 
gorbachev also met separately with czechoslovak premier ladislav 
adamec and communist party leader karel urbanek tass said and 
the question of the terms on which soviet troops stay in 
czechoslovakia came up for discussion the question was referred 
to the two nations foreign ministries 
tass report implied soviet readiness to remove some troops 
saying reduction of armed forces and armaments on condition of 
maintaining european balance is the indispensable guarantee of 
stability in europe 
the tass report on gorbachevs speech to the warsaw pact leaders 
indicated he said the warsaw treaty organization and the north 
atlantic treaty organization can contribute to the strengthening 
of european security as political alliances the official summary 
pointedly avoided any reference to their status now as military 
alliances 
in a time of momentous political change in eastern europe four 
of the seven warsaw pact nations have replaced staunch communists 
with more reformminded leaders this year including noncommunist 
polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki on monday more than 
150000 people rallied in prague monday to demand the resignation 
of czechoslovakias government 
further meetings at the kremlin monday and tuesday indicate more 
developments may be in the offing 
gorbachev met monday with ceausescu romanias stalinist leader 
and the only east european leader to resist the wave of reform 
sweeping the communist bloc tass said they had a frank exchange 
regarding socialist construction 
gorbachev also met with east german prime minister hans modrow 
on monday and was expected to meet tuesday with west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher to discuss soviet resistance to 
calls for possible reunification of the two germanys 
tass said gorbachev told modrow the soviets see east germany as 
an important guarantor of peace and stability in eastern europe 
east germanys longtime leader erich honecker was ousted oct 
18 after thousands of citizens fled west and others staged mass 
protests for reforms egon krenz replaced honecker but was forced 
on sunday to resign as communist party leader though he remains 
president 
petar mladenov replaced ousted bulgarian party chief todor 
zhivkov on nov 10 and karel urbanek replaced czechoslovak leader 
milos jakes on nov 24 after prodemocracy demonstrations 
tass said genscher met with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze monday

alexander dubcek ousted in disgrace as 
czechoslovakias communist party leader after the sovietled 
invasion in 1968 praised his countrymens struggle for democracy 
and said you cannot suppress an idea 
independent television news broadcast on monday an interview 
with dubcek in bratislava the 67yearold leader of the prague 
spring reforms said an idea is going to survive within 
peoples conscience 
he spoke of the 17 years he lived in forced obscurity after 
being removed from office in 1969 and stripped of party membership 
in 1970 
they wanted to totally isolate me i was followed 
everywhere he said i had to keep my circle of friends small 
to protect them maybe they thought i couldnt take it 
psychologically but i could its been a hard life but we are still 
here 
dubcek was relegated to work as a minor forestry official in the 
slovak capital of bratislava and barred from travel the 
restrictions were relaxed after soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev visited czechoslovakia in april 1987 
reforms instituted by gorbachev in the soviet union have surged 
like a tidal wave through the east bloc and on nov 24 
czechoslovakias hardline communist government resigned under 
public pressure tens of thousands of people cheered dubcek in 
pragues wenceslas square on his triumphant return to the capital 
to speak in prague gave me a deep sense of satisfaction he 
said monday twenty years ago their parents cheered me now these 
children are doing the same and supporting the same ideas 
he said many of the democratic reforms being demanded now were 
part of his 1968 plans 
there was no internal power willing to stop the prague 
spring we were suppressed by external force he said speaking 
through an interpreter the basic idea is the same now you 
cannot suppress an idea an idea is going to survive within 
peoples conscience 
thousands of czechoslovaks demonstrated monday protesting the 
composition of the new communistdominated government 
dubcek was asked if he might become president and he said for 
the presidency its up to the people to decide 
dubcek received virtually complete vindication monday when a 
warsaw pact summit meeting in moscow condemned the 1968 invasion as 
interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign 
czechoslovakia

president bush said monday its too 
early to proclaim an end to the cold war but added that mikhail s 
gorbachevs acceptance of sweeping reform in eastern europe 
absolutely mandates new thinking by the west 
wrapping up his weekend summit journey with a stop at nato 
headquarters bush also told reporters the united states would 
maintain significant military forces in europe as long as our 
allies desire our presence 
the president said he wants a treaty making initial cuts in 
superpowers conventional forces in europe in the bank before 
seeking deeper reductions he told nato leaders he hoped a 
multinational summit could be convened in europe next summer to 
sign such an accord 
conventional forces aside the united states and soviet union 
are negotiating a proposed 50 percent cut in longrange nuclear 
weapons as well as a proposed ban of chemical weapons 
bush was in a buoyant mood as he neared the end of a journey 
that took him to last weekends summit with gorbachev 
asked if it hadnt been risky to venture out in a small boat in 
the stormtossed harbor in malta during the weekend he replied 
hot dogging no you know these charismatic macho visionary 
guys theyll do anything 
he arrived at the white house in washington by helicopter from 
andrews air force base to be greeted on the south lawn by his wife 
barbara who got a kiss and dog millie who got a pat the 
president waved to a small welcoming crowd and headed inside 
without speaking 
the president spoke as gorbachev was convening a meeting of a 
radically reordered warsaw pact in moscow to review the weekend 
summit 
the dramatic change in europe continued uninterrupted during the 
day as the soviet union and the four other warsaw pact nations 
condemned their own invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 in leipzig 
east germany about 200000 demonstrators broke into wild rounds of 
applause as speakers called for german reunification 
bush and gorbachev leaders agreed at an unprecedented joint news 
conference before leaving malta that their meeting heralded a new 
era of cooperation in eastwest relations including arms control 
and trade they intend to meet again in the united states in the 
second half of june 
at his news conference bush said we stand at the threshold 
of a new era but declined to assert the cold war has ended as 
gorbachev suggested 
that day hasnt arrived the president said when asked about 
gorbachevs statement declaring an end to the epoch of the cold 
war 
barring a utopian development bush said the united states 
must stay involved by keeping troops massed against warsaw pact 
forces 
if you want to project out 100 years or take some years off 
of that you can look to a utopian day when there might be none 
us troops in europe he said but as i pointed out to them 
nato leaders that day hasnt arrived and they agree with me 
dutch prime minister ruud lubbers said he was impressed by the 
united states extraordinarily positive attitude toward events 
in europe 
it has nothing to do with a we are pulling out attitude 
he told reporters on the contrary they are again promising a 
meaningful presence in europe 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said bushs speech 
was so full of meat that we really should consider it very 
carefully before we reply to it she has urged a more cautious 
attitude than some allies toward events unfolding in eastern europe 
the president began his news conference with a statement that 
said a peaceful revolution was taking place in eastern europe 
where five hardline communist regimes have fallen in recent weeks 
he said his goal was to see individual freedom everywhere 
replace coercion and tyranny 
bush apparently referring to disagreements about central 
america said all was not sweetness and light at the malta 
summit but took pains to applaud gorbachevs handling of the 
change in eastern europe 
as i watched the way in which mr gorbachev has handled the 
changes in eastern europe it deserves new thinking it absolutely 
mandates new thinking he said 
asked what had emerged at the summit he said i think he took 
my measure and i took his and i think we both feel more comfortable 
about our common objectives 
he said gorbachev was determined and unemotional in their 
private talks the soviet leader seemed very much in control 
and very confident in discussing without notes a wide array of 
subjects with me 
bush said some allied nations seek deeper cuts in conventional 
forces than are being considered in the vienna talks but he said 
they viewed the rapidity of change differently than we do 
and yet bush registered a renewed personal determination to 
realize completion of the treaty next year between nato and the 
warsaw pact that would cut us troops by 30000 and the soviets by 
325000 to an equal level of 275000 
the two alliances armories of tanks artillery and other 
nonnuclear weapons also are due to be cut back in a grand scheme 
to reduce tensions from the atlantic ocean across the vast expanse 
of europe to the ural mountains in the soviet union 
lets get it done bush said he told reporters i as 
president of the united states will kick the bureaucracy to get it 
done 
negotiators working on the accord in the austrian capital are 
making brisk progress but several issues are unresolved most 
significantly a dispute over the kind of soviet airplanes to be 
scrapped 
in addition bush said he was hopeful the west could take steps 
to ease soviet economic woes we want to try to meet him on some 
of the areas where he needs help im thinking of a few suggestions 
i had in the economic area he said 
but i also believe that the west must remain strong and 
together and try to be helpful where we can in a united way but 
not be imprudent he said 
dutch foreign minister hans van der broek said bush reported to 
the nato leaders that gorbachev had accepted the multination 
summit proposal for next year 
the importance of this is that it indicates both bush and 
gorbachev want to make an effort to reach such an agreement next 
year the dutch official told reporters 
also at the nato session bush outlined his policy on german 
reunification it rejected a timetable even though us ambassador 
vernon a walters on sunday had predicted a merger of east and west 
germany within five years 
bush said he favored a step by step approach that also 
maintained west german membership in nato and said i am not 
trying to accelerate that process 
even so officials announced that bush was sending secretary of 
state james a baker iii to germany next week for a symbolic visit 
to the berlin wall a symbol of the cold war that has been opened 
to free travel

the plos campaign to win recognition in 
the general assembly as the provisional government of palestine 
broke down monday and negotiations shifted to finding a facesaving 
retreat diplomats said 
they attributed the failure to upgrade the plo to 
observernation status in the general assembly to shallow support 
divisions within the palestine liberation organization and a us 
threat to stop contributing to the united nations 
a vote on the resolution was postponed until wednesday 
the climate is not right now said a senior palestinian 
diplomat speaking privately he said the plo might try to revive 
the idea next year 
the plo is recognized by the united nations as an observer 
organization it was seeking to gain recognition as a nonvoting 
observer state such as north and south korea switzerland san 
marino monaco and the vatican 
washington said it would cut off all us funds for the united 
nations if the plos status was upgraded the united states is 
assessed 216 million annually onefourth of the un budget 
one western diplomat speaking on the condition he not be 
identified said a rift had developed between plo chairman yasser 
arafat at the organizations headquarters in tunisia and farouk 
khaddoumi the plo foreign secretary who heads the groups un 
delegation 
khaddoumi was the guiding force behind the general assembly 
resolution to upgrade the plos status while arafat believed the 
effort was counterproductive and last week ordered a halt the 
diplomat said 
european and us diplomats worked with arab and nonaligned 
movement officials through the weekend to avoid a showdown 
negotiations on a discrete way for the plo and arab group to 
postpone consideration of the resolution were not complete when the 
time arrived monday afternoon for a vote and formal action was 
deferred until wednesday 
the diplomatic sources said the resolution will be suspended 
wednesday 
as a member of the 102member nonaligned movement the plo 
supposedly had enough support to prevail on a simple majority vote 
in the 159member general assembly 
but western diplomats said the vote could have been very close 
because many nonaligned nations did not feel the issue was worth 
losing us funds 
egypt and morocco in the arab group did not support the 
resolution and the soviet union and its allies also were opposed 
the resolution draft states the plo has the powers and 
responsibilities of the provisional government of the state of 
palestine and shall be construed within the united nations as 
the state of palestine 
last year the plo declared the existence of a state of 
palestine without specifying exact borders in the israelioccupied 
west bank and gaza strip and has said more than 80 nations formally 
recognized the state 
the united states and many western governments have not 
recognized the move saying the declared state lacks the basic 
attributes of a state such as a functioning government and 
defensible boundaries

warsaw pact leaders met monday amid rapid 
bewildering political change in eastern europe and uncertainty 
about the 34yearold military alliances role and unity 
at mondays session the soviet union and pact members bulgaria 
hungary east germany and poland condemned their own action in 
invading czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush a reform movement 
the soviet news agency tass also said the kremlin and prague 
will begin talks on possible reduction of soviet troops still based 
in czechoslovakia 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev indicated at the meeting 
that the warsaw pact and its western opponent the north atlantic 
treaty organization will someday become political rather than 
military alliances 
for leaders of four of the seven nations it was their first 
meeting underscoring how quickly old guard communists have been 
swept from power they heard gorbachev report on his malta summit 
with president bush 
erstwhile diplomatic cover for the kremlins ideological 
policing of its allies the sevenmember pact faces unprecedented 
pluralism from its first noncommunist head of government polish 
premier tadeusz mazowiecki to romanias hardline communist leader 
nicolae ceausescu 
somehow those men must agree on eastern europes future and 
defense policy if the warsaw pact is to be an alliance in anything 
but name chastened by past interventions in their countries 
lives some reformers now in power also want guarantees that the 
pacts armed might will not be turned on them 
having already ceased to make ideological demands on its allies 
the warsaw pact should stay out of member nations politics 
altogether said foreign minister gyula horn of hungary where 
legal groundwork was laid this fall for democratic multiparty 
elections 
horns fears are not baseless in midaugust the romanians 
reportedly requested joint warsaw pact action against poland to 
preserve communist party rule 
in fact under gorbachev the soviets appear ready to accept 
virtually any sort of political change in eastern europe provided 
allegiance is unshaken to the defense treaty written in 1955 at a 
time of tight sometimes violent kremlin domination 
all the reforms which no one could have imagined a few years 
ago will be accepted in moscow unless they lead to the questioning 
of membership in the warsaw pact the polish newspaper zycie 
warszawy commented recently 
intriguingly recent soviet pronouncements indicate the kremlin 
envisons the pacts future in a blurring of functions with the 
council for mutual economic assistance or comecon the notoriously 
ineffective socialist trade bloc that includes all warsaw pact 
members 
in october soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said 
the kremlin would be interested in negotiating the abolition of 
both nato and the warsaw pact by the year 2000 as part of the 
kremlin campaign to create a common european home but later 
in an interview with the official polish news agency pap 
shevardnadze noted 
for the time being the two alliances do exist and one should 
aim for their gradually being transformed into politicalmilitary 
organizations through developing civilian trends of their activity 
with a simultaneous reduction of all military elements 
what east bloc military leaders traditionally subservient to 
their parties think of such notions is unknown but warsaw pact 
defense ministers sounded an apparent note of discord at a meeting 
in hungary on nov 2729 by highlighting the nato threat 
the military budgets and longterm development programs of the 
armed forces of the united states and other nato countries still 
aim to preserve military might as the chief tool of attaining their 
foreign policy objectives the ministers said in a communique 
according to nato figures the warsaw pact has 3 million 
fulltime military personnel compared with 22 million for the 
western alliance pact statistics in contrast claim rough parity 
36 million for nato and 35 million for the east bloc 
the agreement on friendship coordination and mutual 
assistance was signed may 14 1955 in warsaw by the soviet 
union albania bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany hungary 
poland and romania the treaty was in effect a response to the 
admission of west germany to nato 10 days earlier 
the pact provided the machinery by which the soviets could 
control the eastern european military transmit foreign policy 
guidelines to their satellites and exercise political control 
throughout the cordon sanitaire to their west 
the treaty was used as a legal screen for military interventions 
now condemned by eastern europes reform governments in 1956 
revolt broke out in hungary when the government demanded the 
withdrawal of soviet troops and stated its intention to leave the 
pact to become a neutral country soviets troops crushed the revolt 
and installed a new leadership 
alexander dubceks prague spring reforms in czechoslovakia 
also were snuffed out when sovietled warsaw pact tanks invaded in 
1968 to restore a moscowaligned government soviet leader leonid 
i brezhnev said the alliance had the sacred duty to protect 
socialism wherever it was threatened 
that assertion which became known as the brezhnev doctrine has 
been repudiated by gorbachev foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov jocularly noted the kremlin now practices the sinatra 
doctrine named for frank sinatras trademark song my way by 
letting each of its allies do things its way 
some disagreement with moscow was allowed in the past the 
communist hermit state of albania formally pulled out of the pact 
to protest the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1958 romania 
withdrew from its agreement to permit stationing of soviet troops 
on its soil and ceased to take part in warsaw pact military 
exercises 
moscows allies also balked when the soviets in 19567 and 
19678 tried to form a standing warsaw pact army they feared 
their troops might be deployed to support purely soviet adventures 
for example on the chinese border 
nevertheless 34 years after its creation the warsaw pacts 
machinery remains dominated at all levels by soviets in february 
gen pyotr lushev a first deputy defense minister replaced 
another soviet marshal viktor kulikov as alliance commander

attorney general dick thornburgh disclosed 
monday that he had ordered a preliminary inquiry to determine 
whether a special prosecutor should investigate alleged criminal 
wrongdoing by former housing secretary samuel r pierce jr 
justice department spokesman david runkel said a letter to 
congress delivered earlier in the day informed lawmakers of the 
action 
thornburgh ordered the inquiry in response to a request by 19 
house democrats that he appoint a special prosecutor formally 
known as an independent counsel to investigate allegations of 
criminal wrongdoing by pierce when he ran the scandalplagued 
department of housing and urban development 
runkel said the preliminary inquiry which the department has 60 
days to complete started on saturday 
a lawyer for pierce robert plotkin dismissed the move as 
insignificant saying he was confident it would not result in 
appointment of an independent counsel 
under the very low threshhold the statute requires we arent 
surprised that a preliminary inquiry has been undertaken plotkin 
said we are confident that at the end of the 90day period they 
will find there is no basis for appointing an independent counsel 
rep bruce morrison dconn one of two members who led the 
call for an independent counsel said he was pleased that we are 
finally moving in the right direction of exploring the criminal 
side of the hud scandal 
i hope that if a special prosecutor is ultimately ordered that 
the attorney general will ask for broad jurisdiction so that the 
prosecution if any at the highest levels of hud are all 
coordinated morrison said there is enough here that justifies 
a careful look by an independent counsel 
lawmakers suggested there was evidence of a conspiracy by pierce 
and other top officials at the department of housing and urban 
development to defraud federal urban aid programs by awarding 
grants on the basis of political favoritism 
the congressmen all members of the house judiciary committee 
had also suggested in their nov 2 letter that pierce had lied to 
the house government operations employment and housing subcommittee 
when he testified last spring 
the lawmakers cited pierces testimony that he was did not have 
a hands on involvement in dispensing hud grants to private 
developers 
rep charles schumer dny who with morrison led the call for 
an independent counsel said thornburghs decision is a move that 
should be welcomed by everyone including exsecretary pierce 
this investigation is a fair and thorough way to get answers 
to questions that are not going away schumer said he said he 
was convinced that an independent counsel is the best and perhaps 
only way that all answers about the scandal will come out 
under the independent counsel law thornburgh was required to 
decide within 15 days of receiving the lawmakers nov 2 letter 
whether to proceed with a preliminary inquiry the law gave him 
another 15 days to report that decision to congress 
independent counsels are appointed by a special federal court 
that reviews applications submitted by the justice department 
after receiving their request last month thornburgh pointedly 
accused of of the lawmakers of trying to inject partisan politics 
into this matter which has until now been handled on a 
nonpartisan professinal way by the congress hud and this 
department 
even more distressing is the assertion by the congressmen that 
criminal acts have been committed before criminal investigations 
have been completed thornburgh said 
thornburghs comments were directed at schumer and morrison 
in a session with reporters last week thornburgh bristled at 
the suggestion that the justice department was not aggressively 
pursuing an investigation of pierce because the two men sat 
together in president reagans cabinet 
let me tell this in this or any other case dick thornburgh 
is going to go where the evidence leads the attorney general 
said if the evidence is there we will take appropropriate 
action if its not we wont 
morrison suggested that thornburgh would not have ordered with 
preliminary inquiry without the request from the lawmakers saying 
there is no indication that it wouldnt have happened without our 
initiative

eden pastora a former sandinista hero 
who switched sides and fought with the contras said monday that 
opposition groups in nicaragua did not want him to return from 
exile 
pastora also know as commander zero is a former sandinista 
vice minister of defense who fought with the contras from 198386 
and then retired to private life he returned sunday to support the 
social christian party 
repeating what he said at a rally immediately after his arrival 
pastora called the social christians an alternative to the ruling 
sandinista national liberation front and the usbacked national 
opposition union known as uno in the feb 25 national elections 
the social christian party and its presidential candidate erick 
ramirez persuaded pastora to return to nicaragua and support them 
few believe pastora can add many more followers to the social 
christians 
the controversy surrounding commander zero already has attracted 
the kind of news media attention the social christians a minority 
party had sought unsuccessfully about 25 journalists crowded a 
small conference room monday morning at party headquarters but 
ignored ramirez who sat next to pastora 
many questions revolved around pastoras past 
pastora said that he had spoken with some uno members they 
left me with the impression that they did not want me to return to 
nicaragua 
sectors of the cia in alliance with the contras were 
responsible for the bombing at his southern nicaragua jungle 
hideout in 1984 where four journalists were killed he said 
pastora alleged that the attempt was made because i never wanted 
to accept antipopular postures adopted by the contras he did 
not elaborate 
pastora said he intends to settle in nicaragua if he can 
continue the fishing business he runs in neighboring costa rica 
commander zero as he is still known gained world attention 
aug 20 1978 when he led 20 sandinista rebels in a takeover of 
the national palace 
the rebels held dozens of legislators hostage and succeeded in 
freeing from prison 50 sandinista leaders among them daniel ortega 
and tomas borge who are now president and interior minister 
eleven months later the sandinista came to power in a popular 
revolt that forced president anastasio somoza to flee 
after the sandinista victory in 1979 pastora became vice 
minister of defense and of interior but grew disillusioned with the 
sandinistas and left the country in 1981 it is said he was 
embittered when he was denied the post of defense minister which 
went to and is still held by ortegas brother humberto 
in 1983 pastora joined the contras fighting in the southern 
front but his outspoken criticism and independence soon led him 
into strong differences with the contras in 1986 he quit fighting 
and left for costa rica

americans in hotels occupied by rebel soldiers and to pay tribute 
to her courage in seeking to quell the rebellion white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
bush had just completed a 9hour journey from brussels where he 
briefed the nato allies on his weekend summit with mikhail 
gorbachev when he called the philippine leader 
the president tried to call mrs aquino earlier in the day and 
was unable to get through so when we got home tonight he went 
immediately up to the residence and replaced the call fitzwater 
said 
the rebellion broke out friday before dawn philippine time just 
before bush embarked on his journey to malta 
vice president dan quayle presided over an allnight meeting of 
the national security council in the white house and bush later 
approved overflights by us fighter jets based in the philippines 
to keep rebel aircraft on the ground 
despite claims by the aquino government that it had quashed the 
rebellion fighting continued in manila for a fifth day tuesday 
with 2000 foreign tourists and business people trapped in the 
embattled makati financial district some 215 americans were holed 
up at three hotels in the district according to the us embassy

american lives fitzwater said then the president ended the 
conversation by saying i appreciate your concern for the 
civilians were proud of you for standing up with great courage 
we want to see you succeed 
asked if bush was considering sending in us troops to rescue 
the americans fitzwater said we dont think that will be 
necessary

his concern for the lives of americans who were trapped in these 
hotels he just wanted to ask that she make every attempt to 
protect their lives 
national security adviser brent scowcroft who had accompanied 
bush on air force one on the journey back from europe was with the

the main defendant in 
yugoslavias largest political trial in decades accused serbias 
leadership monday of staging the trial as part of its policy of 
repressing ethnic albanians 
azem vlasi a former communist party chief in kosovo told the 
court on the first day of his defense that the trial represents 
the worst possible violation of human rights 
vlasi and 14 other ethnic albanians are accused of engaging in 
counterrevolutionary activities and of inciting unrest last winter 
in which at least 25 people died 
at the time ethnic albanians who make up almost 90 percent of 
the provinces 19 million people were angered by constitutional 
amendments that gave serbia greater control over the affairs of the 
province 
kosovo is a part of serbia the nations largest republic and 
had previously enjoyed a measure of autonomy 
vlasi denied the charge that he was responsible for the deaths 
which occurred during clashes between protesters and security 
forces 
he said his trial was organized by slobodan milosevic the 
republics leader and rahman morina kosovos current party chief 
district public prosecutor spasoje zamfirovic demanded several 
times that vlasi be prevented from giving what he said was a 
political speech but judge ismet emra overruled the objections 
vlasi denied he had visited a nearby mine where workers staged 
an eightday sitin in february to incite the strikers as 
claimed in the indictment 
i went there exclusively for humane reasons he said adding 
that he had reported his activities to milosevic and to morina 
a political trial has been staged on behalf of a policy which 
advocated repression in kosovo so that the province may be ruled 
through a state of emergency instead of democratic methods vlasi 
said 
milosevic led the drive earlier this year for constitutional 
amendments he said were necessary to protect kosovos slav minority 
from harassment by ethnic albanians 
vlasi 42 faces the death sentence if found guilty 
he is being held in the titova mitrovica prison during the 
trial which began oct 30 
vlasi said prison conditions were brutal but that he would 
not be broken i can disappear physically but i will not 
submit he said 
the trial continues tuesday and vlasis defense presentation is 
expected to last five days 
the federal leadership meanwhile said monday that a clash 
between slovenia and serbia two of its constituent republics 
seriously threatens yugoslav unity 
the statement from the nations eightmember state presidency 
was carried by the official tanjug news agency 
serbia cut all political and business contacts with slovenia 
last wednesday after authorities there banned a rally by serbs 
the presidency said without elaborating it will take all steps 
necessary to solve the worst political crisis in communist 
yugoslavias 46 years of existence 
it said the federations political situation has dangerously 
deteriorated because of the clash which seriously threatens 
yugoslavias integrity 
the yugoslav federation consists of six republics and two 
autonomous provinces encompassing varied ethnic groups and 
religions the latest row brought to a head a long series of bitter 
disputes between slovenia and serbia 
slovenias liberaloriented leadership advocates regional 
autonomy and has legalized opposition parties that are to contest 
the firstever free multiparty elections in postworld war ii 
yugoslavia scheduled for next march 
serbias leadership favors a centralized federation and opposes 
westernstyle political pluralism 
several serbian firms said monday they are severing all economic 
ties with slovenian firms and closing down branch offices there 
economists say cutting business ties will backfire since serbia 
is economically much weaker than slovenia 
yugoslavias political economic and social problems have 
mushroomed since the death in 1980 of president josip broz tito 
who founded the modern yugoslav federation in 1943

for use by top east german communist officials will be put into 
passenger service the state news agency adn said monday 
klaus henkes general director of the national airline 
interflug told adn about half the planes were ready for immediate 
use on charter flights and the rest would be converted for 
passenger use 
the jetliners will remain based at army airfields because 
civilian east german airports currently do not have enough hangar 
space and maintenance capacity adn quoted henkes as saying 
use of the previously official fleet of planes will allow 
interflug to sell off noisy fuelguzzling older soviet models and 
expand capacity to meet passenger demand in east germany 
henkes said experts estimate the number of east germans flying 
annually will double to 6 million by the year 2000 
the fleet reserved for east german statesmen included 
sovietbuilt tu134 tu154 and il62 models adn said

there isnt a messier musical in town than up 
against it an apt title for this chaotic song and dance 
adaptation of an unproduced screenplay originally written by joe 
orton for the beatles 
the musical which opened monday at the new york shakespeare 
festival public theater defeats a lot of people particularly a 
slew of talented performers such as alison fraser philip casnoff 
and toni dibuono director kenneth elliott and orton himself 
only hints of ortons wicked humor show through in this 
flatfooted and tuneless version of his story adapted for the stage 
by tom ross with music and lyrics by rock star todd rundgren 
orton the iconoclastic english playwright who was murdered by 
his lover in 1967 apparently fashioned a satiric tale about the 
adventures of two british scamps and a subsequent war between the 
sexes in the musical the battle takes place after a group of 
radical men have assassinated the female prime minister she is 
replaced by another even tougher woman played with relentless 
assurance by the booming dibuono 
ross scattershot book takes on religion the rich rightwing 
politicians sexual stereotyping the military and all points in 
between 
the low point of the musical occurs when the men dress up as 
women to infiltrate a political rally held by the prime minister 
the number is called what else life is a drag and it is as 
hard to watch as it is to listen to 
most of rundgrens score is a disappointment except for a fine 
ballad entitled parallel lines it is remarkably conventional 
blandly at odds with the outrageousness of the story being told on 
stage 
elliott has directed the show at a furious pace and jennifer 
mullers choreography is equally athletic nothing stops for very 
long although the musical numbers have a way of numbing the story 
line rather than advancing the plot 
what orton and the beatles would have done with up against 
it is a tantalizing question there are hints of such beatle 
movies as a hard days night and help in some of the 
musicals more frantic posturings but you would be better off to 
rent videos of those classics than sit through up against it

rancher gabriel raba figures the 
present calendar switches around too much on the number of days in 
a month so hes drawn up a new plan where thered be 28 days each 
month all 13 of them 
i havent had hardly anybody that didnt agree with me said 
raba 78 but i might not live long enough to see the change 
his calendar would be easy to understand and remember raba 
says thirteen 28day months equals 364 days making up for the 
365th day is simple just create a 48hour new years day 
leap year every four years also would have an extra 48hour day 
wiping out the current feb 29 
the current calendar adopted in 1582 has 12 months with either 
28 29 30 or 31 days 
the raba calendar would mean fixeddate holidays would always be 
on the same day of the week every month would start on monday 
which is the first day of rabas weeks 
the current names of months and days would remain but the 13th 
month would need a name 
raba said he has suggested the calendar to president bush 
former gov bill janklow current gov george mickelson the united 
nations canadian officials and others 
all the answers i got they thought it made sense and was 
good he said but most didnt know if we was quite ready for 
it yet they all agreed that were due for a change somehow

the navy outmuscled greenpeace 
antinuclear protesters monday crippling their vessels and towing 
them out of an area where they tried unsuccessfully to halt the 
test launch of a trident 2 missile 
the high seas drama took place in the atlantic 50 miles off the 
florida coast just before the nuclearpowered submarine tennessee 
unleashed the 265 million missile on a test that put the trident 
2 program back on track after two explosive failures in the first 
three undersea launches 
we did a perfect launch just beuatiful vice adm roger 
bacon commander of the atlantic submarine fleet said at a news 
conference 
the navy said its ships had to shoulder aside a large ship 
carrying protesters and capture and tow away two highspeed rafts 
called zodiacs from the launch area 
greenpeace usa peace activists said the navy rammed their ship 
aimed fire hoses down its smoke stacks to stop its engines and that 
navy divers had sliced the fuel lines and punctured the pontoons on 
the zodiacs 
bacon said hoses were used and that navy sailors in rafts cut 
the fuel lines on one of the zodiacs after the other broke down in 
heavy seas 
three navy helicopters made life even more miserable for the two 
men in each of the zodiacs by hovering overhead making already 
choppy seas even choppier 
shannon fagan a spokeswoman for the protesters said a navy 
ship the 254foot submarine support ship uss grasp left two 
gashes in the hull of the mv greenpeace a 190foot oceangoing 
tug she said the largest about 3 feet long was stuffed with 
mattresses to keep water out 
cmdr deborah burnette a navy spokeswoman said navy officials 
at the scene reported only one hole about 1 foot in diameter in the 
greenpeace hull 
this is a terrible outrage said peter bahouth executive 
director of greenpeace usa in a statement this is an unbridled 
act of aggression against a peaceful protest in international 
waters 
fagan said greenpeace was considering legal action against the 
navy 
greenpeace had successfully used the ship and zodiacs to block a 
trident 2 launch attempt july 28 but the navy was ready for them 
this time 
we were more prepared today because we looked at what they 
tried to do on july 28 and we used the minimum force necessary 
today to clear the area bacon said 
once the protesters vessels were muscled outside the 5000yard 
diameter safety circle the tennessee sent the 44foot missile 
shooting out of a tube in the deck it broke the atlantic surface 
ignited and propelled a dummy warhead package to an ocean target 
several thousand miles away 
the navy announced the success about 20 minutes after the 1040 
am launch 
we issued repeated warnings to clear the area burnette said 
of the greenpeace incident the mv greenpeace acknowledged our 
warnings and declared its intention to stay in the area two 
submarine support ships grasp and kittiwake shouldered it out of 
the safety arc 
burnette said the warning told the protesters that if the ship 
did not move the navy will exercise its rights under 
international law and will forcibly remove you 
the mv greenpeace radioed back you are doing your best but 
you havent sunk us yet we are staying 
fagan said the ship was dead in the water for a while after 
the navy ships poured water down the smoke stacks but the crew got 
one of the two engines restarted and the ship headed for port in 
jacksonville fla after nonessential people were taken off by 
helicopter 
the incident began shortly after the nuclear submarine uss 
tennessee submerged for the attempt to launch the trident 2 missile 
on its fourth test flight 
two of the first three trident 2 launches from the submarine 
ended in explosions just above the surface the second in the 
series was declared a success by the navy 
the failures blamed on an inadequately designed nozzle system 
had set back the plan to send operational trident 2s to sea late 
this year but if the program continues to succeed over about half 
a dozen more undersea launches the tennessee is scheduled to go on 
operational patrol next spring with 24 of the deadly missiles each 
is capable of hurling up to 12 nuclear warheads to different 
targets more than 4600 miles away 
nineteen landlaunch tests 15 of them successful preceded the 
sea trials

church leaders monday called on religious 
individuals and organizations to provide nonjudgmental and 
compassionate care and support to people suffering from aids 
the leaders also called on churches to develop accurate and 
comprehensive aids education materials in a context that promotes 
individual selfesteem teaches the fundamental goodness of human 
sexuality and supports the integrity of responsible and caring 
intimate relationships 
the comments were included in a consensus statement on 
appropriate religious responses to the aids epidemic adopted monday 
by about 130 clergy and lay leaders from christian jewish 
unitarian and interfaith groups during a conference at the carter 
presidential center 
the religious community has a responsibility to assure that 
all whose lives are affected by the epidemic will have access to 
compassion nonjudgmental care respect support and assistance 
the statement said 
the right rev douglas e theuner chairman of the joint 
commission on aids and bishop of the episcopal diocese of new 
hampshire said church leaders must overcome a perception among 
aids sufferers that religious people view the disease as the 
wraith of god for an immoral lifestyle 
some think that the religious community believes aids is a 
judgment of god but by and large the religious community does not 
and those of us in a position of leadership need to convey that 
more forcefully he said 
the consensus statement said churches have a responsibility to 
transform public attitudes and policies so that adequate care and 
appropriate preventative measures will be available for all people 
in need 
the group called on president bush to demonstrate moral and 
political leadership by protecting people with aids from 
discrimination by expanding drugtreatment programs to all who 
choose them by expediting the experimental treatment approval 
process by expanding homecare programs for aids sufferers and by 
encouraging strict confidentiality of aids tests 
the statement said foreigners should be allowed to visit or 
become citizens of the united states if they are eligible to do so 
regardless of whether they have aids 
the group also advocated comprehensive programs for drug users 
including the distribution of aids prevention information and 
materials including bleach for the sterilization of hypodermic 
needles 
aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a deadly disease 
which attacks the bodys immune system crippling its ability to 
ward off infections that are not a problem for most people such as 
a rare pneumonia and a rare skin cancer 
the latest federal public health figures indicate 112241 people 
have been reported with aids since 1981 and 59 percent of them have 
die from it no one is known to have recovered 
sixty percent of the total cases have involved homosexual or 
bisexual males 20 percent were intravenous drug abusers and 
another 7 percent were both drug abusers who were also homosexual 
males fortythree percent of all cases involved minorities 
in a reference to those statistics the group said in its 
consensus statement that because barriers among us based on 
religion race class gender and sexual orientation that continue 
to generate fear persecution and violence are intensified by the 
aids epidemic we call upon all sectors of our society 
particularly our faith communities to adopt as highest priority 
the elimination of racism classism sexism and homophobia 
the conference was cosponsored by the aids national interfaith 
network the atlanta interfaith aids network and the carter center 
of emory university 
among the groups represented were the evangelical lutheran 
church in america the african methodist episcopal church the 
united synagogue of america the union of american hebrew 
congregations the unitarian universalist association the baptist 
general convention of texas the universal fellowship of 
metropolitan community churches the united methodist church the 
united church of christ the roman catholic church and the 
episcopal church

curbs monday on the pesticide ebdc saying widespread use of the 
chemical on scores of crops from apples to tomatoes poses an 
unreasonable cancer risk 
the epa proposed eliminating the use of the ebdc family of 
fungicides on 45 crops but said its continued use on another 10 
food products including grapes onions and cranberries do not 
present an unreasonable risk to consumers 
the proposed restrictions would eliminate from agricultural use 
about 80 percent to 90 percent of the estimated 18 million pounds 
of ebdcs that are sold annually in the united states according to 
government and industry officials 
ebdcs or ethylene bisdithiocarbamate are a group of pesticides 
that have been used since the 1930s to control fungi and protect a 
wide variety of food crops against damage from mold mildew and 
fungal diseases the group includes the specific fungicides maneb

president bushs latest veto will play better 
in beijing than at home so it probably wont stand up when 
congress reconvenes but it may serve an administration purpose in 
the meantime 
the bill bush rejected would make it easier for chinese exchange 
students to remain in the united states for up to four years in 
his veto statement bush called that a laudable objective and said 
he will have the same thing done administratively without changing 
the law preserving my ability to manage foreign relations 
while the administration said all along that the bill wasnt 
necessary congress insisted on it in response to chinese 
repression of prodemocracy dissidents last spring sponsors of the 
student visa bill said the bloody crackdown that began in tiananmen 
square last june 4 isnt over yet 
there are about 40000 chinese students in the united states 
and more than 30000 of them hold visas under which they are 
required to return to china for at least two years before seeking 
new or longer stays in this country 
after the tiananmen crackdown and killings the administration 
imposed limited sanctions aimed primarily at halting military sales 
and cooperation exchange student visas were extended for a year 
so that no chinese student would be required to leave before june 
1990 
while bush said he will have attorney general dick thornburgh 
extend that stay for up to four years supporters of the bill argue 
that will mean casebycase handling exposing individual students 
to retribution if they ever do go home 
because of the visa bill the chinese government has threatened 
to prevent college students from coming to the united states to 
study and also have said it may permanently end the suspended 
fulbright scholarship program under which americans study in china 
i want to see these exchanges continue because it is in the 
national interest of the united states to promote the exchange of 
technical skills and ideas between chinese and americans bush 
said in his veto message issued last thursday just before he left 
for his malta conferences with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
it is my hope that by acting administratively we will foster 
the continuation of these programs bush said there is no 
guarantee that the veto will satisfy the chinese since the 
president said he will do what the bill required anyhow and the 
measure probably will be passed again early next year 
because congress is in recess until jan 23 the bill was killed 
by pocket veto when bush failed to sign it by saturday the votes 
are there to enact it again whatever bush does the bill passed 
the house 403 to 0 and the senate without a dissenting voice vote 
seventyone senators more than enough to override a veto signed a 
letter urging the president to sign it 
while he didnt take their advice bush used the veto message to 
reemphasize my commitment to never allow any action that 
would force the return of chinese students if their lives or 
liberty are at risk 
chinese officials and educators insist that returning exchange 
students face no danger or persecution but advocates of the bill 
say many of them would be in jeopardy sen edward m kennedy 
dmass said some would be forced to go underground lest they face 
imprisonment or death like the tiananmen demonstrators 
the veto fit the advice former president nixon brought back from 
china after a sixday visit that ended nov 2 nixon gave bush an 
18page written report and met privately with the president and his 
top foreign policy aides to recommend efforts to improve relations 
despite the suppression of the democracy movement 
he said continuing sanctions would only strengthen reactionaries 
in the chinese government even so nixon didnt anticipate the 
veto saying bush probably had no choice politically but to sign 
congressional sanctions 
the reasoning in nixons china memo suggests that even an 
unsuccessful veto might help bush in future dealings with beijing 
the former president who sent bush to china as us representative 
after ties between the two nations were reopened in 1972 said 
bushs personal standing with the chinese is a positive factor 
in our sometimes very tense discussions not one of the 
chinese leaders had a negative word to say about president bush 
nixon said they would sometimes blame the congress the media 
and the voice of america but never the president

as much as 750 billion of equity is held by 
homeowners who are 65 years or older a category in which financial 
stress is rising because among other things of higher taxes and 
health care costs 
in some instances older couples meet expenses only by reducing 
their lives to the bare elements or worse while simultaneously 
sitting atop six figures of housing assets they are well off but 
cash poor 
the situation always a cause of distress among social workers 
government officials and others concerned with the elderly is 
becoming even more so as large numbers of people enter the upper 
age categories 
simultaenously the houses in which they live sometimes continue 
to rise in value creating an even more pronounced contrast between 
cash flow and value tied up in real estate 
repeated attempts to resolve the dilemma have been made over the 
years but no privatesector mortgage lender insurer or other 
financial institution has marketed a popular solution 
two of the great fears are clearly revealed in surveys 1 
having enough money to live on and 2 having to move from the 
house 
among the possible solutions now available 
1 sell the house and with the proceeds move into a retirement 
community for many people this is a practical solution but it 
doesnt help those who want to remain right where they are 
2 saleleaseback the house is sold but the former owners 
remain where they are they obtain a guarantee of residency money 
from the sale is invested and some of it may be used to pay the 
rent 
drawback insecurity resulting from unknowns chief of which is 
the ability to make a sufficient return on investments to make 
monthly rental payments 
3 home equity line of credit this enables the owners to draw 
on home equity to meet unanticipated expenses the drawback is fear 
of exhausting the credit line because of living expenses or 
longevity 
4 reverse mortgage under this plan monthly sums are withdrawn 
from the equity and along with a charge sent by the lending 
institution to the owner in the best of them the owner receives 
written assurance of lifetime tenure 
still there are drawbacks if the reverse mortgage is for a 
fixed term rather than for life the monthly income is higher but 
the assurance of a roof over the head is gone lifetime tenure in 
effect a reverse annuity mortgage reduces insecurity but pays 
relatively little each month 
the us department of housing and urban development estimates 
that for a 70yearold borrower a reverse mortgage on a 100000 
home at 10 percent produces 654 a month for five years or 411 for 
a 10year period 
however if the reverse mortgage is for lifetime tenure the 
monthly amount drops sharply to 278 
actuarial tables suggest strongly that if possible it might be 
wise to delay implementing a reverse mortgage at age 75 for 
example the 5year note would pay 812 the 10year mortgage 510 
and the tenure mortgage 367 
an encouraging development but largely experimental is offered 
through certain lenders by the federal housing administration 
which has agreed to insure 2500 reverse mortgages through 
september 1991 
the issue however is much larger than that and it will become 
more so as the population ages the equity piles up and the need to 
use it becomes pressing whats needed is the proper product

the changes sweeping eastern europe are 
reshaping the continent suddenly the old bipolar equation 
western europe vs eastern europe has been overturned by the 
rebirth of an older geographical entity called central europe 
the script is having to be rewritten almost every week will 
poland hungary east germany and czechoslovakia become western 
democracies will the germanys be united and if united will the 
german colossus once again threaten europes stability to try to 
answer some of these questions the associated press asked five 
west european commentators to contribute their thoughts 
the following overview the first of five articles was written 
by adrian gv hydeprice a research fellow on the international 
security program at the royal institute of international affairs in 
london specializing in eastwest relations and european security

thursday nov 9 the day the east german 
authorities allowed their citizens to travel freely to the west 
marks the simultaneous end of the cold war and the emergence of the 
german question as the decisive issue of european politics 
the lifting of the iron curtain is cause for celebration and 
euphoria at the same time the strategic and political 
ramifications are enormous and therefore it is also cause for 
sober reflection and what the dutch foreign minister has called 
constructive alertness 
the bipolar structures of the cold war effectively displaced 
deepseated national and ethnic rivalries in europe and replaced 
them with a security system which was for all its many faults 
relatively stable and predictable one of the crucial features of 
this security order was the division of germany which provided a 
degree of reassurance to many of germanys traditional opponents 
today however the old certainties and assumptions of the 
postwar period are disintegrating under the combined impact of the 
changes associated above all with perestroika in the east and 
the 1992 abolition of internal tariff barriers in the european 
economic community this is nowhere more apparent than in central 
europe where as the cold war divisions fade away older patterns 
of cooperation and conflict are reemerging changes in this 
sensitive region however inevitably open the pandoras box of the 
german question which is now the central issue of european 
politics 
the german question predates the division of germany and 
stems from the difficulty of integrating german power into the 
european interstate system germany has traditionally been the 
fulcrum of the european balance of power and this is why the 
recent assertion of people power in the german democratic 
republic has led to so much discussion about the future of europe 
the reform process in east germany will inevitably entail a 
qualitative change in innergerman relations and therefore a 
substantial shift in the balance of power in continental europe 
the worries are twofold 
first there is the immediate concern about west germanys 
growing economic political and military weight in europe this has 
already been felt within the eec and nato where the west germans 
have shown themselves willing and able to assert their national 
interests on economic and financial matters as well as over the 
issue of modernizing shortrange nuclear forces 
in eastern europe west german economic and political influence 
has been expanding as the military and political dominance of the 
soviet union has declined west germany is now well placed 
geographically economically and culturally to benefit from the 
new markets and investment opportunities opened up by the reform 
movements in the soviet union and eastern europe at the same time 
the renewal movement in east germany will inevitably bring the 
two german states closer together particularly in the economic 
sphere thereby facilitating west german penetration of the rest of 
eastern europe bonn is thus set to become both an economic and a 
political giant in european politics 
second there is the fear that in the long term a reunified 
centralized german nationstate a fourth reich could emerge 
its precondition would be the collapse of east germany as a viable 
political and economic entity 
this gives rise to two possible scenarios first west germany 
simply expanding to absorb east germany while remaining a member 
of both the eec and nato this would be unacceptable to the soviet 
union and might unbalance economic and political relations within 
the western alliance the second possibility is that the soviet 
union faced with a disintegrating east german state might decide 
to make the best of a bad deal and allow germany to unite and 
remain a member of nato provided it became fully denuclearized and 
all foreign troops withdrew from german soil 
this might be acceptable to the germans but it would spell the 
end of nato as an effective military alliance 
in order to assuage fears of a reunited and resurgent fourth 
reich therefore it is essential that the west collectively 
formulate a strategy for managing the changes in eastcentral 
europe and in innergerman relations above all a broader european 
framework must be forged within which the german question can 
be successfully managed 
this involves recognizing that the selfdetermination of the 
german people does not necessarily entail reunification and that 
the central issue in germany at the moment is the democratization 
of east germany 
also a unified or confederated germany would only be acceptable 
to germanys neighbors in the context of a european community that 
is both well advanced along the path toward economic and political 
union and that is open to new forms of cooperation and association 
with other democracies in europe within this broader european 
framework german power could be diffused upward to the 
supranational institutions of the eec and downward to its own 
regional governments

on the european economic community 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
initial comment on the extraordinary 
events that culminated in the breach of the berlin wall tended to 
dwell on the damage these developments might inflict on the 
european community 
the federal republic it has been suggested would now be much 
more interested in reunification than in western european 
integration every mark spent in leipzig was one less mark 
available for lisbon encouraged perhaps by calculations of this 
kind those who were opposed anyway to speeding up the ec 
integration process by for example the convening of an 
intergovernmental conference on economic and monetary union seized 
the occasion offered by the events in germany and elsewhere to 
counsel caution 
now was not the time prime minister margaret thatcher of great 
britain and her allies proclaimed for the eec to dwell on its own 
internal problems when so much was happening beyond its frontiers 
these early reactions are beginning to appear rather 
superficial none of us it should be stressed has much idea of 
how events will develop in the east they are beyond our control 
they also seem to be beyond the control of either government or 
opposition leaders 
the reunification issue is an example sober reflection a few 
days after the wall came down suggested that speculation about 
prospects for german unity was largely a western phenomenon a few 
days later banners in leipzig proclaiming unification as a highly 
desirable objective complicated the picture yet again where the 
east is going and how quickly remains uncertain 
these uncertainties have not however prevented the emergence 
of a fairly widespread consensus among western european leaders 
themselves that in the new circumstances the ec far from being 
redundant is the indispensable cornerstone of any new european 
system this consensus manifested at the highest levels at the 
paris dinner party for the heads of government and state of the 12 
ec member countries in november rests on various assumptions 
that the european community is the surest framework within 
which the germans themselves can pursue an active policy toward the 
east and eventually perhaps achieve reunification 
that in a period in which the emphasis in eastwest relations 
is bound to rest on economic and nonmilitary matters the european 
community is best placed to coordinate and channel western aid and 
technical assistance 
that in a broader perspective the community can and should be 
seen not only as the most appropriate basis for the european pillar 
of the atlantic alliance but also as the indispensable western 
pillar in a new european security system in which the soviet union 
will remain a military superpower regardless of what happens to the 
warsaw pact 
against this background it is now possible to see the eastern 
developments as a catalyst of western integration in the new 
circumstances european community leaders are almost sure to 
demonstrate their determination to continue with their own progress 
toward union economic and monetary union is the obvious practical 
initiative for which highly developed plans already exist 
in any case it is already obvious that the community will be at 
the center of a number of high profile efforts to assist the east 
directly these economic and technical means will furthermore be 
backed up by even more conspicuous political initiatives involving 
as president francois mitterrand of france implied after the paris 
summit visits to eastern europe at the highest level 
finally the acceleration of events and the obvious intention of 
european community leaders to play an active role can only 
strengthen those elements in the bush administration who already 
see the community collectively as the ideal longterm partner with 
whom to discuss not only economic issues but also political and 
security questions 
for those committed to the further development of european 
union these prospects can only be highly gratifying there are 
however serious dangers that the west european themselves should 
be the first to recognize and deal with 
a stronger western europe organized through the european 
community can and should be a major asset to the western alliance 
it is not however as currently organized in any practical sense 
linked to the alliance machinery 
more important a stronger western europe that is a magnet to 
the east almost certainly will be seen in the soviet union as a 
potential threat ready in the worst case to gobble up dissident 
members of the warsaw pact however unfounded these fears may be 
the community should take active steps to reassure the soviet union 
and to cooperate with it

last nov 9 1989 east german 
authorities decided to open their borders with west germany by now 
almost half the population in east germany has traveled to west 
berlin or to the federal republic to see for themselves what this 
capitalist society really is like 
more important this mass migration westward turned into an 
emotional gettogether of the germans not just for those who had 
not seen their relatives for many years but for everybody 
undoubtedly the opening of the border symbolized spectacularly 
by the instantaneous scrapping of large sections of the hideous 
wall was a tactical move of the communist authorities intended to 
open a safety valve and head off the constant stream of 
demonstrations in almost all major cities in the german democratic 
republic 
this strategy may perhaps still succeed in part but all the 
same the situation has changed fundamentally the peaceful mass 
demonstrations have above all achieved one thing suddenly the 
fear instilled by an oppressive police state for so many years 
has given way to a new selfconfidence 
the momentous events not only in the gdr but in eastcentral 
europe may perhaps be called the beginning of a third democratic 
revolution the first was the age from 1760 to 1800 highlighted by 
the american and french revolutions and the second by the gradual 
though not continuous advance of democratic government in the west 
since the beginning of the 20th century 
for one marxistleninist ideology is discredited the highly 
bureaucratic and oppressive system of a centrally directed 
socialist economy which had been established in east germany 
perhaps more effectively than anywhere else has failed 
disastrously just a few people on the top so it emerges were 
capable of making farreaching decisions affecting the economic 
performance of a whole country without any effective control and 
almost wholly on ideological grounds now democratization has 
become unavoidable by any standards 
besides the crumbling of the wall will imply that the east 
german economy can no longer be run in isolation between the two 
german states economic cooperation on the governmental and private 
levels as well as much economic help will be needed to forestall a 
complete breakdown of the economy and mass deprivation in east 
germany something that would be in nobodys interest this may 
require establishing special links between the federal republic 
west berlin and east germany it remains to be seen whether in the 
medium term these will devolve into a sort of german confederation 
as seems likely or whether they will be kept on an informal level 
that does not affect the statehood of either of the two germanys 
right now the people from both germanys are reluctant to go any 
further the west germans do not want to weaken the close political 
and economic ties they have established with the west neither are 
they prepared to abandon the alliances with the west even though 
the danger of an aggression from the soviet union may become 
remote instead they hope that all steps regarding the 
intensification of the relations with east germany as well as with 
the other eastcentral european countries will be done in full 
cooperation with their western partners 
the time may be ripe for a second marshall plan this time to be 
organized on an international level with the active participation 
not only of the united states and the european economic community 
but possibly also japan it all depends however on what happens 
in the soviet union itself west germans are now perhaps more than 
ever interested in making things easier for mikhail gorbachev in 
order to see his reform policies succeed for they are fully aware 
that all depends upon whether the soviet union will tolerate the 
process of democratization in east central europe and in 
particular in east germany 
come what may the democratic revolution under way in poland 
hungary and now east germany and czechoslovakia will change the 
course of history a return to the old ways of a bureaucratic 
socialism seems unlikely the national idea long believed to be 
gradually supplanted by the european idea seems to have a 
remarkable revival however it may no longer be quite the 
dangerous creature to which we have grown accustomed in the 1920s 
and 1930s rather it is a nationalism that believes in a europe of 
free nations

britain is in but not of europe she 
did not share the psychology of the original six who founded the 
european community in 1958 france the federal republic of 
germany italy belgium holland and luxembourg all of whom 
suffered from fascism and enemy occupation 
for them world war ii showed that the nationstate had to be 
overcome through the creation of supranational institutions for 
britain the war meant the triumph of the nationstate her finest 
hour not feeling ashamed of her past she felt assured of her 
future as a global superpower the center of a worldwide empire 
rather than a middleranking european country 
she has always known that sooner or later she will have to put 
aside her ambivalence and decide whether to join the continent or 
stand aside the cataclysmic changes in central and eastern europe 
ought to bring this moment of truth closer 
although the late french president charles de gaulle did his 
best to keep britain out of the european community the british 
approach to europe has always been gaullist britain favors a 
europe of cooperating but sovereign independent nations rather 
than any pooling of sovereignty entering the community in 1973 
she thought she was joining merely a customs union rather than a 
dynamic organization whose purpose was european union prime 
minister margaret thatcher has given forceful expression to this 
conception of europe 
superficially the changes in central and eastern europe make 
the british governments case for a loosely organized community 
more plausible for if central europe is being unraveled what is 
the sense in continuing with the creation of a closed community in 
the west 
instead so the british argument goes new forms of association 
need to be created that can bridge the evernarrowing ideological 
gap between west and east it would be parochial to concentrate on 
the machinery of integration exchange rates monetary union and 
the like when the solid scaffolding of the europe we knew is 
disintegrating before our eyes 
this conception in the view of most of the other governments in 
the community ignores the vastly increased danger of instability 
in central europe the withdrawal of communism is likely to bring 
to the surface all kinds of national conflicts submerged since the 
war through the might of the soviet empire in particular a 
reunited germany which now looks a distinct possibility could 
threaten the balance of power in europe 
it especially frightens the poles whose frontiers in the 
absence of a peace treaty have still to be finally agreed and the 
french invaded three times by germany in the past 120 years the 
french therefore are in the vanguard of those arguing that german 
reunification can only be safely attempted if germany becomes fully 
integrated into the european community 
britain does not share this fear of germany less traumatized by 
world war ii she was more willing to forgive and forget less 
scarred by history she finds it difficult to imagine a reunited 
germany as anything other than benign traditionally britains 
role in europe has been to stand apart preserving the balance of 
power against the attempt of any single power to dominate the 
continent that remains the instinct of many leading british 
conservatives 
the opposition labor party has recently taken a distinctly more 
proeuropean stance yet this transformation of attitudes it was 
the conservatives who took britain into the community while as 
recently as 1983 labor was promising withdrawal from it owes as 
much to hostility toward mrs thatcher as to genuine european 
conviction 
there are signs that attitudes are changing survey evidence 
earlier this year suggested that 55 percent of the british 
electorate regarded the community as a good thing the highest 
figure since britain joined the euroelections which were 
catastrophic for mrs thatcher showed that there is no longer a 
strong antieuropean constituency in britain 
it remains to be seen whether the convulsions in central europe 
will finally convince the public that britain is essentially a 
european power eventually britain will have to make a decision of 
principle whether she wishes to be part of the new political 
entity being created in western europe or remain an offshore 
island devoid of both power and influence

is communism dead 
everyone knows that communism is not confined geographically to 
europe and the soviet union 
a billion chinese and millions of vietnamese laotians 
ethiopians romanians afghans and cubans still live under 
communist regimes that have remained stalinist or become bornagain 
stalinists 
the cambodian conflict is not between communism and democracy 
but rather between two types of communism at the end of 1989 
there were still 50000 cuban soldiers in angola protecting a 
nonelected communist power 
mozambiques economy has been destroyed in a disastrous 
experiment with marxism and by the civil war that followed many 
quasimarxist regimes in madagascar algeria benin and nicaragua 
continue to starve their populations and start wars at home or 
with their neighbors or both 
i firmly believe that communism is dying but communism is far 
from having disappeared 
there is no doubt communism is fading rapidly in eastern europe 
where it has never been accepted and where it has always been seen 
as an imported system imposed and maintained artificially by a 
foreign power 
when the threat of military repression became highly unlikely 
thanks to the policies of mikhail gorbachev the desire for 
democracy could explode freely so can we say the cold war is over 
as the current phrase has it not quite 
for what is the cold war it was the direct result of stalins 
annexation of eastern europe freed from the nazis by the red army 
and immediately reoccupied by that same red army 
what does gorbachev say that these countries can become 
political democracies with market economies provided they remain in 
the same geostrategic and diplomatic framework as the cold war in 
other words if they regain their internal freedom these countries 
remain satellites as far as foreign policy is concerned for the 
time being anyway 
this is the position gorbachev has been pushing hard and it has 
been accepted by the west generally known as finlandization 
it is much more than that for the warsaw pact countries 
finland is not directly included in soviet military calculations 
and does not have soviet troops stationed in its territory one can 
foresee that the warsaw pact agreements never freely negotiated 
by the peoples concerned will have to be reexamined by their 
future democratic governments eager to become sovereign states 
once again 
as for the soviet union the major new element is the failure of 
perestroika no one in the west seems to have clearly grasped this 
but every soviet citizen now takes it for granted even economists 
in gorbachevs entourage 
for nearly five years the soviet leader has tried to get the 
soviet economy back on its feet by using a market socialism 
formula which injects a little pragmatism and profit motive in an 
overall structure that remains intact 
result in 1985 the situation was bad today it is 
catastrophic communism can be discarded it cannot be repaired 
that is if you begin to really repair it you quickly realize that 
the only way out is dropping it altogether thats what has 
happened in hungary and poland thats what china refused to do 
resorting to mass terror 
the soviet union has not made a clear choice between capitalism 
with private property or the return to stalinist collectivism

a pentagon historian with access to 
stillclassified war records has put together a remarkable new book 
on what went on behind the scenes as us leaders sought a way to 
give the war in vietnam back to the vietnamese the final 
years by jeffrey clarke of the armys center of military 
history gives previously undisclosed details of a tug of war 
between the secretary of defense and his top generals

illled illtrained plagued by corruption 
and desertion the army of south vietnam found itself relegated to 
backwater skirmishes and hamlet defenses in its own war the 
americans with half a million soldiers had taken over 
shouldering aside the people they had been sent to advise 
but back home the american people lost their stomach for a war 
that seemed endless pointless unwinnable and a new president 
richard m nixon cast about for a way to get out without losing 
he toyed with getting tougher 
his defense secretary melvin r laird formerly a hawkish 
congressman from wisconsin had a different idea 
laird called it deamericanization then changed that to 
vietnamization it was supposed to mean retreat without defeat 
it provided that if talks under way in paris failed to bring peace 
to vietnam the vietnamese would be left to fight the war alone 
vietnamization would train them and supply them to take over 
just as john f kennedy once said so many lives before 
the us military both in vietnam and in the pentagon resisted 
lairds plan they read vietnamization as a slow road to disaster 
they felt the south vietnamese alone could not in the jargon of 
the day hack it 
and so was fought a warwithinthewar a battle between nixon 
laird and henry a kissinger on one side and the military command 
in the defense department and at military headquarters in the field 
on the other it was a battle over whether the united states could 
extract itself honorably from a war without winning it or at 
least get out of the business of fighting it 
laird now an executive of the readers digest says the united 
states had little choice but to find a route out 
i knew we had to withdraw he said in a recent telephone 
interview we could not continue americanizing the war we had to 
deamericanize it i got that into the republican platform in 1968 
the term vietnamization i invented that i named it 
the story of the tug of war behind the laird strategy is the 
chief topic of a new volume in a series of books by pentagon 
historians on the american experience in vietnam 
the book the final years by jeffrey clarke a civilian 
historian on the staff of the armys center of military history 
documents how a defense secretary forced a resisting military 
establishment to give the war back to the south vietnamese telling 
details never previously revealed 
it is part of a comprehensive and objective account of 
americas experience in vietnam which even before the war had 
ended the center had decided to produce 
clarke proves beyond a shadow of a doubt what i had suspected 
and seen traces of in fragmentary documentary evidence 10 years ago 
but couldnt really prove says george herring a university of 
kentucky professor and one of the countrys leading historians of 
the war 
herring calls the pentagons accounts firstrate and 
balanced it is remarkable that they could come out of an army 
agency he says it reflects well on the army 
clarke had access to stillclassified war records he uses 19 
pages to list his sources of information records from the 
pentagon the us embassy and us military headquarters in 
saigon the files of kissingers national security council the 
debriefing papers of senior american officers and memoirs written 
by former vietnamese military leaders at the request of the army 
his thesis washington forced both the idea and the timetable of 
vietnamization upon a us military that felt what laird demanded 
a plan to make south vietnam quickly capable of prosecuting the war 
alone was simply beyond saigons capacity to achieve 
despite the divergent view of the major us agencies involved 
in the war effort and despite the unanimous opinion of these same 
agencies that the south vietnamese could never deal with a combined 
viet congnorth vietnamese army threat the new administration had 
instructed the american military command to develop plans for 
turning over almost the entire ground war effort to the forces of 
saigon he wrote 
gen creighton w abrams jr the us commander and his 
generals insisted that tens of thousands of americans would be 
required to stay behind in a support and air combat role if 
vietnamization were to have any hope of staving off a communist 
victory 
but laird thought the military was stalling he demanded a plan 
to extricate american troops 
laird of course prevailed the withdrawals started in 
mid1969 continued while kissinger sought to reach an accord with 
the north vietnamese in both secret and public fourparty talks in 
paris and ended in december 1973 with the last american troops 
brought home 
sixteen months later the kissinger peace process having 
collapsed communists rolled triumphantly into saigon and the war 
was over 
nixon had been elected in 1968 after promising to end the war 
seeking the republican nomination he said in new hampshire in 
february that if the war had not ended by election day the 
american people will be justified to elect new leadership and i 
pledge to you the new leadership will end the war and win the peace 
in the pacific 
he said he did not mean withdrawal from vietnam but 
contended the war can be ended if we mobilize our economic 
and political and diplomatic leadership but he refused to 
elaborate brushed aside all effort to draw him out nixons idea 
became known as his secret plan to end the war 
eighteen years had passed since the first us aid had gone to 
aid the french fight communist insurgents in vietnam laos and 
cambodia nine years had passed since the first two american 
soldiers had been killed in vietnam 
the american people had grown warweary casualties kept rising 
but victory was not in sight and the saigon government was seen as 
dictatorial and corrupt 
all told 30000 americans had been killed in action by the time 
nixon was sworn in another 16000 battle deaths were to occur 
during the withdrawals in addition 10000 americans died off the 
battlefields mostly in planes that were shot down

nixon had suggested the existence of a secret plan to end 
the war during his presidential campaign clarke writes but 
after three months in the white house he had yet to come up with 
any alternatives to the application of greater force and the 
secretary laird felt that he had a better idea 
says laird now the secret plan was in my head 
withdrawal was the only alternative we had and we had to do it in 
an orderly fashion you could have had public support for the first 
two years probably but not beyond that 
so on march 5 1969 six weeks after nixons inauguration laird 
flew to saigon to present his concept of scheduled systematic 
withdrawals to take place regardless of what was happening on the 
battlefield to abrams a tank commander who in 1968 had succeeded 
gen william c westmoreland as chief of the military assistance 
command vietnam macv 
according to clarkes account the general balked insisting 
that all withdrawals depend on his assessment of the military 
situation in vietnam 
the joint chiefs of staff backed up abrams setting the stage 
for a long struggle between washington and macv 
lairds recollection is somewhat different he says abrams might 
have made his objections known but always ultimately went along 
with laird 
general abrams pointed out certain reasons why he thought the 
program i laid out was too rapid a withdrawal but he was more 
supportive of my withdrawal figures than were the joint chiefs of 
staff thats why i promoted abrams to army chief of staff over the 
objections of the white house they were not great abrams fans 
there 
in any event it was a struggle heres the story as laid out 
in clarkes official history 
in march 1969 laird returns from his visit to saigon and 
reports to nixon that the size of the american contingency is 
actually stiffling south vietnamese initiative 
he says the orientation of american military leaders seems 
to be more on operations than on assisting the south vietnamese to 
acquire the means to defend themselves that he says explains 
macvs tolerance of saigons high military desertion rate and 
marginal military leadership he says macv has no program to reduce 
the american military commitment and contends the development of 
such a program should receive our first priority 
he recommends withdrawing 50000 to 75000 soldiers in 1969 
abrams approves tentative planning for withdrawing 50000 
soldiers but repeats his personal opposition to unilateral us 
troop withdrawals and his insistence that all withdrawals depend on 
his assessment of the military situation in vietnam 
in april 1969 kissinger with nixons approval embraces 
lairds concept and signs a directive instructing the defense 
secretary to prepare a specific timetable for vietnamizing the 
war his directive foresees the progressive transfer of the 
fighting effort to south vietnamese forces without insisting on 
an expansion of the south vietnamese army and even without 
awaiting a reduction in the number of north vietnamese troops in 
south vietnam 
kissinger says us withdrawals are to start july 1 the united 
states is to return to a support and advisory mission in vietnam 
in may abrams questions the size and pace of the projected 
withdrawals gen earle g wheeler chairman of the joint chiefs 
assures him that kissingers july 1 target was picked only for 
planning purposes wheeler says american redeployments will take 
into consideration the military situation 
but abrams knew better and his concern proved justified the 
book says only a few days after wheelers second communique he 
received notice that withdrawals might come sooner than expected 
and to prepare alternate plans for the redeployment of 50000 and 
100000 troops 
macv reluctantly draws up a vietnamization plan but it is based 
on the major assumption that about 275000 support troops will 
remain following the withdrawal of most combat forces that 
insistence on maintaining a huge support contingent clarke says 
was the principal response of american military leaders to what 
seemed to be an impossible order from washington 
in its war assessment macv advises washington that the south 
vietnamese will not be capable before 1972 of handling even the 
viet cong not to mention the heavily armed and bettertrained 
north vietnamese and even then us advisory and materiel support 
will be required indefinitely 
macv says that until then the saigon forces simply are not 
capable of attaining the level of selfsufficiency and overwhelming 
force superiority that would be required to counter combined viet 
cong insurgency and north vienamese army main force offenses 
in june nixon announces the withdrawal of the first 25000 
americans he meets with south vietnam president nguyen van thieu 
at midway island to discuss vietnamization 
saigon accepted american withdrawals as a political 
necessity clarke writes 
but thieu points out that the americans had been preparing 
saigon merely as clarke put it to deal with a residual 
insurgency not to square off against the strength of the entire 
north vietnamese army 
the south vietnamese president asks for an immense increase in 
military equipment if his army is to fight both the viet cong 
insurgents and the north vietnamese army heavy main battle tanks 
and missile tanks howitzers artillery radar antiaircraft 
missiles c130 air transports and 95 other aircraft as well as 
the wherewithal for a big expansion of saigons air armor and 
artillery units additionally thieu wants a big injection of 
financial aid to improve the living standards of south vietnamese 
servicemen 
abrams advises laird that most of thieus requests are unneeded 
and clarke wrote too expensive and too complex for the south 
vietnamese to manage by themselves abrams still assumes american 
units will provide air defenses even under vietnamization 
he further advised washington that no new weapons be added to 
saigons arsenal until the south vietnamese became able to operate 
and maintain them he opposes thieus request for financial 
support for south vietnamese forces arguing macv should not be in 
the business of raising living standards for one segment of the 
population 
the joint chiefs of staff agreeing says saigons equipment is 
adequate in terms of the limited vietnamese technical 
capability 
moreover the book says the chiefs say the vietnamese had not 
addressed at midway what american advisers considered key south 
vietnamese military weaknesses poor leadership and high desertion 
rates

in august laird approves abrams proposals for increasing 
saigons strength in the interest of economy he makes it clear 
that whatever money and equipment is provided to saigon is to come 
out of the budgets of the us military he asks the joint chiefs 
of staff to put together a new program that would enable the 
south vietnamese to deal successfully with a combined viet 
congnorth vietnamese threat clarke says macv is also told to 
come up with a plan to improve saigons leadership abilities and 
reduce desertions 
in september macv replies even the increases in saigons 
forces will not enable them to handle a combined viet congnorth 
vietnamese threat without direct us combat assistance 
according to macv saigons armed forces could not be expanded 
beyond the presently authorized manpower ceiling of 993000 nor 
could they be improved qualitatively to the extent necessary to 
deal with a combined threat clarke writes what the secretary 
wanted simply could not be done neither abrams nor his staff 
was able to suggest any changes in saigons military organization 
strategy or tactics that would enable the south vietnamese to deal 
with a combined enemy threat 
adm john s mccain jr pacific commander stresses the danger 
of overtaxing saigons manpower and training capacity he tells 
laird that further acceleration could prove selfdefeating 
november laird refused to take no for an answer clarke 
says the secretary orders the services for the third time to come 
up with a suitable plan and puts them on notice that a large 
residual support force was not in the offing laird wants an 
imaginative plan that he says will address the critical 
problems of corruption leadership motivation and morale 
december macv complies drafting a more optimistic plan it is 
based on the assumption however that there will be success for 
saigons expansion programs progress on the battlefield and a 
declining north vietnamese army threat and it ignores hanois 
forces massed just outside the borders of south vietnam 
but even this new plan is tied to the existence of a large 
american residual support force and clarke says lairds staff 
suspected that the military was still trying to use its 
evaluations of south vietnamese military capabilities to stall the 
withdrawal process 
february 1970 laird revisits saigon communicates his 
disappointment over the lack of any new or fresh concepts the 
south vietnamese ask for more arms including 175mm artillery 
pieces that can fire over the demilitarized zone into north vietnam 
and for financial assistance to raise soldiers living standards 
laird returns to washington and asks the military for an even 
stronger plan 
april the joint chiefs of staff gives laird what he wants 
and much of what thieu is after the new withdrawal plan gives 
saigon two 175mm artillery battalions and other equipment and 
separate ration supplements and dependent housing support for 
thieus troops 
with that the abramslaird struggle over vietnamization ended 
the withdrawals continued throughout 1971 and 1972 without a break 
on the diplomatic front the united states south vietnam north 
vietnam and the viet cong signed the paris peace accords on jan 
27 1973 removing the one remaining obstacle to total us 
withdrawal hanois agreement to return american prisoners of war 
the accords called for a ceasefire and set up an international 
body to police it but the agreement was almost immediately 
violated and the war resumed 
by the end of 1973 the us military contingent in vietnam was 
down to 50 men south vietnam was left to fight its war alone 
on jan 8 1975 the north vietnamese politburo ordered a major 
offensive to liberate south vietnam by a crossborder invasion 
in march in the face of the onslaught thieu withdrew his army 
from the central highlands a move that touched off countrywide 
panic 
the cities of hue and danang fell on april 1113 the us 
embassy staff was evacuated by helicopter on april 29 saigon fell 
to the north vietnamese and the war ended 
vietnamization was not a stragegy for fighting or winning the 
war or even for achieving americas limited objectives in south 
vietnam concludes clarke 
at best it was a political strategy for continuing us 
support for a domestically unpopular conflict and at worst a 
facesaving abandonment of a commitment that american leaders felt 
they could or should no longer honor 
says laird there was no other alternative we had 570000 men 
on the ground in vietnam we had 2 million air force and navy 
personnel supporting them the congress was fed up with vietnam and 
so were the american people the lesson from vietnam should be that 
we should follow the advice that president dwight eisenhower gave 
when the french failed in vietnam never get involved in ground 
warfare in southeast asia

compeer the word means equal companion 
friend peer its also the name of an organization that uses 
friendship as therapy for the mentally disturbed the group matches 
volunteers with clients for oneonone gettogethers each week for 
a year while there have been no scientific evaluations of the 
program mental health experts say it does seem to help

in 1976 trudy pembroke weighed 325 pounds she 
was divorced unemployable estranged from her family and confined 
to a state hospital in rochester ny 
her grim history included a feeling at age 9 that something was 
terribly wrong with her at that age she didnt know she was a 
victim of severe depression and its devastating consequences but 
she was to learn soon enough 
she attempted suicide half a dozen times beginning at age 16 
she was frequently hospitalized for her mental illness 
she had her stomach stapled to lose weight and was admitted to a 
group home but the demons of overwhelming depression won again 
her spirit was broken her fragile selfesteem shattered she was 
hospitalized yet again 
life in a state hospital seemed her destiny 
now 41 trudy today weighs 155 pounds she has her own apartment 
with new furniture she earned an associate degree in college 
bought a new car she calls baby and has a new job 
she is out of therapy and off all medication 
was it a miracle no it was natures medicine friendship 
janice wittmershaus 33 a research physicist was the friend 
she befriended trudy until trudy was well enough to be her own 
friend 
but janice and trudys paths probably would never have crossed 
were it not for an unusual nonprofit organization called compeer 
compeer is the best antidepressant in the world trudy says 
its premise is simply the power of friendship 
headquartered in rochester ny compeer began with 10 patients 
and 10 volunteers and was called adoptapatient in 1976 
bernice skirboll answered a helpwanted ad and took over 
she found the name too patronizing and thumbed through her 
dictionary she found compeer the definition equal 
companion friend peer 
in 1977 skirboll registered the name with the federal 
government began raising money and expanded it to an organization 
that has helped more than 10000 mentally and emotionally 
handicapped people in 119 cities in 37 states and canada 
the friend the compeer contracts to spend one hour a week with 
the client for a year the volunteers undergo brief training they 
meet with a therapist if indicated and submit written monthly 
reports 
mrs skirboll says the backup support for each volunteer costs 
about 450 a year about what it would cost to keep a patient in a 
hospital for three days 
the program exists from gainesville fla to portland ore 
from augusta maine to san diego as well as in smaller cities 
like grand haven mich and great bend kan each has its own 
budget some as high as 150000 but the national norm is 25000 
trudy decided to go public with her story to try to eradicate 
the stigma the mentally ill suffer 
her story is that of a product of a broken home a survivor of 
foster homes and a father she could never please 
i could have become president of the united states and it 
would not have been good enough for him she says i carried 
that attitude into my adult life 
she hasnt seen her father or spoken to him or any of her four 
sisters in the last 10 years although they all live within 50 
miles her mother is dead 
the last time i spoke to him he said the next thing he wanted 
to hear about me was that i was dead trudy recalls i told him 
i would abide by his wishes but that i still loved him his voice 
cracked a little and he said ok goodbye 
i got married at 20 for all the wrong reasons she says i 
didnt love him but i was fat and ugly and i knew no one else 
would ever ask me the marriage lasted eight years 
by the time janice met trudy in 1983 she was living in a 
halfway house but she was thinking of returning to the state 
hospital to the wards she knew all too well 
trudy was in the state hospital when she was paired with her 
first compeer a woman who stayed with her for six years but then 
moved from rochester and they lost touch 
bernice arranged for janice to take over trudys case but after 
the second or third visit trudy told janice not to bother to come 
back

new york come back 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i did everything i could to sabotage the relationship trudy 
says i wouldnt talk to her sometimes when she came other 
times she would just cry but she couldnt articulate what was 
wrong 
but janice was as tenacious as trudy she just kept coming back 
eventually they started going out for coffee they fed ducks on a 
pond they went windowshopping they went to the circus to movies 
i finally started talking a little bit trudy recalls i 
would ask her why she would want to come and see me why should 
anyone care about me she showed me what a true friend is since 
janice i know what a relationship is 
trudy wanted to return to the hospital she felt she couldnt 
make it on the outside janice kept saying yes you can words 
that eventually trudy came to believe 
when trudy started college as janice was studying for her 
masters degree they would often study together 
after trudy got her degree she had about 35 interviews before 
she finally got a job 
after she had been with trudy for three years janices husband 
left the university of rochester for a job in phoenix but janet 
and trudys friendship while no longer an official compeer match 
has survived 
janice calls trudy about twice a month and trudy writes to her 
last year for her birthday janice and her husband sent trudy a 
roundtrip ticket to spend two weeks with them in phoenix 
trudy no longer has or needs an official compeer she has made 
a few friends on her own always with janices encouragement 
trudy blessed with a gift for public speaking volunteers as a 
speaker for compeer she tells her audience she is going to talk 
about a mentally ill person she then gives her own life story 
compeer has become more sophisticated than it was in the early 
days and tries to match people with something in common janice and 
trudy really had nothing in common but one example in harlem 
reflects the extent to which compeer now tries to make these 
friendship dates work 
both the volunteer and the client were originally from jamaica 
and both very interested in music especially reggae the music of 
the island and so john bent 39 a victim of schizophrenia became 
the friend of howard clarke 22 a senior at lehman college 
the rev robert smalls of the macedonia baptist church and the 
compeer director at the upper manhattan mental health clinic 
brought the two together about four months ago 
bent whose disease dates back to his student days in 
manchester england has very few friends and is frightened to 
leave the house the voices that bedevil him despite medication 
get louder the hallucinations become three dimensional if he is 
with someone however it is easier 
clarke brings records and videos to the fourstory walkup bent 
shares with his wife and five children 
despite the age difference both are students in their own way 
on one of their recent visits clarke asked if bent knew anything 
about the dutch philosopher spinoza the subject of one of his 
classes that afternoon it turned out he did so instead of 
listening to music as usual the two chatted about philosophy 
neal brown director of community support for the national 
institutes of mental health in rockville md says compeer seems 
to be very effective 
everybody who has been involved with them has nothing to say 
but good about them says brown he adds however there has not 
been an objective and scientific evaluation of the program 
the studies in rochester where the program began indicate 
compeer significantly cuts the rate of a patients reentry to an 
institution 
sixty percent of previously hospitalized patients return at some 
point according to mental health professionals among the compeer 
clients that number has dropped to 15 percent skirboll says 
although compeer gets some government money it also gets 
donations from such corporations as xerox citibank eastman kodak 
honeywell atampt general motors and merrill lynch 
dr martin von holden executive director of rochester 
psychiatric center says he has 80 compeer volunteers working in 
the hospital a facility with 500 patients and 200 outpatients 
its a wonderful way to transition a patient from the hospital 
to a halfway house or group home von holden says

a new high school soon to open in the suburbs of 
new york city reflects the growing japanese presence in america 
the aim of the school is to prepare japanese children for college 
back in their home country there are some decided differences in 
the way students are drilled in japan and the united states 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
east will meet west on the campus of keio 
high school an experimental academy that will teach the children 
of japanese executives posted in america 
the school on the grounds of manhattanville college in this 
suburb of new york city is scheduled to open in september 1990 
construction of a classroom and administrative building a 
gymnasium cafeteria and dormitories began in the fall 
keio was conceived as a way to attract japanese businesses to 
new york state but it is now seen as an important educational 
effort in its own right an experiment in bilingual bicultural 
education that could help expand the horizons of education in japan 
and in the united states 
the school is a bellwether for the state if not the 
country says j edward meyer the regional representative on the 
new york board of regents the states educational policy board 
it could become an instant model 
the catalyst for the creation of the school was concern about 
the education of the children of the growing number of japanese 
businessmen who work in america an estimated 20000 to 30000 live 
in the northeast alone the most in any area of north america 
yasumitsu nihei who will be principal of the new school says 
the average stay of the japanese businessman once was about five 
years but now theyre staying longer and the needs of their 
collegebound children are more important 
most japanese children want to attend a university in their 
homeland to be mainstream in japan says nihei in many cases 
workers stay with a single company all their lives and to get into 
that company they must get into the right school he says 
but to get into the university students must pass an 
examination all of their previous education from the second grade 
on is geared toward drilling them with the facts necessary to pass 
that test they attend school eight hours a day 5 days a week 
240 days a year 
by comparison american students attend six hours a day five 
days a week for about 180 days a year and american schools 
concentrate less on the rote memorization that is commonplace at 
japanese schools 
there is an elementary school based on the japanese system in 
new york city but until recently high school students often were 
sent home to japan 
the meiji gakuin university of tokyo plans to open a traditional 
japanese high school in sweetwater tenn where 70 japaneseowned 
companies including nissan sharp and matsushita have operations 
meanwhile terry lynam a spokesman for gov mario cuomo said 
new yorks department of economic development had seized on the 
establishment of a school to help japanese businessmen already here 
and attract more 
tokyos prestigious keio university was consulted matilda 
cuomo the governors wife even visited the university during 
negotiations 
they settled on manhattanville as the site of the new school 
because it was close to new york city and because manhattanville 
has a sister school in japan the university of the sacred heart 
half the faculty in the new school will be american and the 
curriculum will cull the best from the american school system 
particularly an emphasis on writing which is more american than 
japanese 
the curriculum will meet graduation requirements of both new 
york and japan and an outstanding student at the school would be 
assured entry into keio university without the dreaded exam 
while it is expected that japanese students will make up most of 
the student body american students will not be excluded 
entrance into the school will be based on an exam grades 
bilingual ability demonstrated in written essays letters of 
recommendation and extracurricular activities 
the school will operate on two semesters and will accommodate 
both the japanese school year which runs april to march and the 
us school year tuition is projected at 12000 a year room and 
board at 4000 
manhattanville president marcia savage said students from her 
school will studentteach at the school or work in labs there 
dr paul valenti superintendent of harrison schools is also 
looking forward to a partnership with his asian neighbor 
in his district 67 percent of the districts 2166 students 
are asian mostly japanese but only 24 students in the harrison 
high school system are asian 
harrison currently offers a bilingual program for japanese 
students at its parsons elementary school 
its an opportunity for us to share programs for both of us 
to learn valenti says some of our japanese students prefer 
the american experience and want to go to an american university 
keio university which is investing 40 million in the school 
including 95 million to buy 27 acres of the manhattanville 
campus feels the experiment could pay dividends at home 
japan is in an age of internationalization says nihei who 
hopes the schools success will lead to similar programs elsewhere 
in the united states

the wagner family of shiner texas is health 
conscious in a big way three wagner brothers following in their 
fathers footsteps became the towns only doctors and five of 
their sons are on their way to becoming physicians thats not to 
mention the female side of the family which includes a nurse a 
dietician and a respiratory therapist 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
theres dr bob and dr dennis as they are 
known around town and dont forget their brother dr pat who 
just retired 
then there are those soontobe doctors ralph timothy thomas 
and ted dennis wagners grown sons and pats youngest son jason 
a premed student 
its kind of contagious says dr bob wagner about what is 
in every sense a family practice 
since the early 1970s bob wagner and his younger brothers 
dennis and pat have been the only physicians in this town best 
known for its beer brewery 
practicing medicine in a small town is not easy but the wagner 
clan loves it 
people say thank you bob wagner says you get a lot of 
gifts you get a lot of food you get turkeys and chickens and pies 
and cakes 
to me somebody thats going to go out of their way to pay for 
a service and then ante up something thats very gratifying 
the 2000 townspeople in shiner have depended on the wagners for 
everything from surgery to treating the flu to delivering babies 
the wagners have delivered an estimated 4500 to 5000 babies 
bob says 
pat 54 retired last year for health reasons now bob 63 and 
dennis 59 keep the medical practice going attending to 40 
patients a day and taking turns treating the sick and doing 
emergency room shifts at a nearby community hospital 
most patients visit the wagners clinic for appointments but 
the doctors still do what most physicians gave up years ago they 
make house calls 
we stay very very busy bob says 
their bustling office in downtown shiner is housed in an old 
school building 
in the waiting room is a portrait of the man who started it all 
frank wagner the father of bob pat and dennis he was not 
surprisingly a doctor 
pat recalls local residents contacted his father at all times of 
the day and night for medical care and his father always responded 
he went to mass and communion every day when he lost a 
patient he would almost lose his mind pat recalls i guess we 
just had a real good man to identify with 
even though he was deeply devoted to roman catholicism frank 
wagner was known to respect the beliefs of others 
he would always prescribe wine for the baptists and 
methodists bob says with a smile they went right along with 
it for medicinal purposes 
frank wagner was so special in town that the local hospital was 
named for him 
his sons lament the hospital was forced to close last year after 
struggling to survive its beds didnt remain full and it fell 
prey to todays medicare reimbursement system that pays a set 
amount for a diagnosis no matter the cost of the service 
now bob and dennis travel to yoakum community hospital about 10 
miles from shiner to care for patients 
the brothers are trying to recruit a new doctor for their 
practice then bob will consider retiring he says but trying to 
get a young physician to come to a small town isnt easy 
the ones who like to hunt and fish and drive a tractor on 
their days off will come on down bob says 
but the three wagners returned to their hometown even after 
studying medicine at prestigious texas medical schools more 
wagners are starting to follow in their footsteps 
dennis says he never encouraged his four sons to go to medical 
school in fact he says i tried to discourage them from going 
into medicine but to no avail 
now ralph is completing his residency in waco and timothy ted 
and thomas are in medical school in houston pats son jason is 
studying premed at notre dame 
the wagner familys interest in health care doesnt end there 
pats wife is a dietician a daughter is a nurse and another 
daughter is a respiratory therapist 
a sister of the wagner brothers has eight children and two of 
them are doctors

was sent to camp sauble on a breaking and entering conviction 
but when you see her it brings your spirits up and makes you 
feel better for the rest of the week 
im glad my mom made me take accordion lessons because its 
opened quite a lot of prison doors simmons says with a chuckle 
one of her hymns she wrote herself and it sums up her message 
i am me and i am good cuz god dont make junk 
simmons began her mostly musical church services at camp sauble 
in 1984 two years after she took early retirement from a 17year 
career as a case worker with the michigan department of social 
services 
when shes not at camp sauble on sunday simmons can be found at 
other michigan prisons she plays monthly at the minimumsecurity 
prison at cassidy lake near ann arbor and at the kinross 
mediumsecurity facility in the upper peninsula 
shes also a regular visitor at several other prisons including 
camps cusino and ojibway in the upper peninsula and camps pellston 
pugsley and waterloo in the lower peninsula 
attendance at simmons services usually runs a remarkable 98 
percent compared with about 10 percent at most prisons across the 
state officials say those who choose not to attend must stay in 
their cells for quiet time most weeks the only inmates not in 
attendance are those who are banned as punishment guards say 
prison officials say simmons services seem to touch many of the 
inmates 
they really put their heart and soul in the services says 
officer john hawkins that sunday service gives them the drive to 
complete the week 
accompanied by her brother on the banjo simmons songs are 
upbeat an inspiration to the offenders who have been given 90 days 
to change their ways if they fail they are sent to a conventional 
prison usually with a much longer sentence 
there are the traditional hymns such as amazing grace and 
within a few minutes nearly every one of the men is clapping and 
singing along in thunderous voices as simmons belts out the tunes 
on her accordion after every song they roar their approval 
a brief christian service follows inmates read along with their 
donated bibles and bow their shaved heads in prayer a guard 
patrols the room 
simmons musical prowess also includes the piano organ and 
guitar in her 20s she sang in an allgirl dance band in lansing 
where she grew up 
besides her commitment to people behind bars simmons deviates 
from the stereotypical grandmother image in other ways she 
recently sold her motorcycle which had earned her the nickname 
motorcycle mama among friends i never had the time to ride 
it she says 
simmons first prison performance came when a fellow male member 
at her assembly of god church who had been playing guitar for 
inmates at camp sauble then a regular minimumsecurity prison 
asked her to fill in one sunday 
it became an addiction she says 
she also began teaching bible class at the prison every tuesday 
it was at those bible classes which eventually grew to 40 
students that she cultivated friendships with about 20 prisoners 
when they were transferred to other state prisons in early 1988 to 
make room for the boot camp simmons began corresponding and 
visiting them all over the state 
they became like family she says some of them have no 
visitors but me many have sent her paintings and small 
prisonmade artifacts 
only about five of the original 20 men remain behind bars and 
many stopped corresponding upon their release simmons says 
that doesnt bother me i had a part of their life while they 
were here but they want to put their past behind them when they 
get out 
simmons doesnt get any money for her prison work but 
emphasizes that she doesnt do it for recognition monetary or 
otherwise 
money would never equal what i get back from these boys she 
says

i rather specialize in old men 
so confesses author john mortimer whose fifth rumpole of the 
bailey series starring leo mckern is running on pbs 
mystery and who has a fourpart play starring 86yearold john 
gielgud running on british tv 
the six rumpole episodes each a separate story began dec 7 
summers lease starring gielgud will come to america in the 
spring 
mortimer retired from practicing law six years ago and doesnt 
miss it now 66 he continues his other career as a writer with 
six more rumpole tales ready to be filmed next april he has 
written more about rumpole than any other character 
i think my writing has got funnier mortimer says the 
last three rumpole series were written when i wasnt a barrister 
any more i can see the law as funnier when im not doing it all 
the time 
rumpole is a favorite of mystery viewers 
he calls himself an old bailey hack he takes cases that start 
fairly grungy and descend to fairly hopeless he drinks chateau 
thames embankment at pommeroys wine bar spouts literary 
quotations and witticisms duels verbally with a wife he calls she 
who must be obeyed and thinks 
everybody from the head of his law chambers to the clerk takes a 
dim view of rumpoles chances in court though he usually makes a 
brilliant deduction that wins the day rumpole is perceived as 
muddling through 
rumpole is real to mortimer but not necessarily the most real of 
his creations 
the man in summers lease dodds the old father does have 
a life of his own he comes bopping in and does his stuff its 
what good characters do mortimer says 
hes played by gielgud in the tv version of it its going to 
come to america in april or may on masterpiece theater its four 
episodes are a huge success in england 
dodds had to be played by a great big star gielgud 
immediately wanted to do it hes bright as a bee he has had the 
most marvelous notices with this part 
in the rumpole stories mortimer says there are always three 
plots the plot of the case which is the least important one his 
life at home and his life in chambers ive always found if you do 
an hours tv what makes it rich is having a lot of stories going 
on at the same time and its more interesting to do 
usually i write the tv scripts first they dont come out for 
nine months during that time i write the book so that the book 
can come out at the time of the tv show 
the paperback rumpole and the age of miracles contains 
rumpoles adventures in the present series 
i do take a lot of trouble not to make the stories look as if 
they were novelizations of scripts mortimer says i dont just 
put he said and she said into it i try to write it as though 
its a work of prose fiction to begin with 
mortimer wrote charade his first novel in 1946 putting in 
his experiences in a world war ii film unit 
i wrote six novels the narrowing stream was about 1954 
then i wrote dock brief which was a radio play 
i gave up writing novels partly because i got into the theater 
and partly because i was married to a novelist penelope mortimer 
who wrote the pumpkin eater it didnt seem to be right to have 
two novelists in the family im not married to her anymore 
three of those early novels have recently been reprinted 
mortimers paradise postponed was seen on tv in america in 
1986 its the result of his being asked to write a 13part tv 
series about england since world war ii 
i thought id write the novel at the same time he says i 
was writing like it was a lot of tv scripts i had to start again 
i hadnt written a novel in 30 years in novels you have to write 
scenes 
mortimer has just finished a sequel called titmuss regained 
which will be published as a book next spring 
its about the concreting over of the south of england 
building a new town and destroying the countryside he says 
britains politics bemuses mortimer 
he says prime minister margaret thatchers great achievement is 
to have taken the conservative party away from the upper class 
and given it to the upandthrusting lower middle class its much 
more ruthless than the old upperclass conservatism old country 
gents were quite keen on looking after the people on the estate 
bringing them blankets and boxes of tea the new type of 
conservatism is just everybody for themselves

geraldine james had doubts about acting in the 
merchant of venice until she learned that her costar was dustin 
hoffman 
when i knew who was playing shylock i became rather keen to 
do it unsurprisingly says the 39yearold english actress 
fresh from a sellout london run as portia to hoffmans jewish 
moneylender in shakespeares dark comedy of caskets the law and 
revenge 
the production directed by sir peter hall marked hoffmans 
british and shakespearean stage debut and packed londons phoenix 
theater for 18 weeks 
the play is now on view at broadways 46th st theater for a 
limited engagement through feb 24 it gives americans the 
opportunity to see a twotime oscarwinner tackle shakespeare in a 
performance which james says changed nightly in london 
to do the trial scene i used to walk on every day not knowing 
what was going to happen she says referring to portias 
fourthact encounter with shylock the beleaguered and vengeful 
moneylender who meets his match in the heiress portia 
when dustin was truthful even if he took choices that were 
wrong he was always brilliant so riveting and unexpected she 
says 
i felt very protective of him the whole company as a 
company was so proud to be working with him he was so generous 
spiritually and literally he wouldnt have his name over the 
title and insisted on me having the last curtain call 
james used a sixweek break before new york rehearsals to 
regather her artistic strength 
we dont ask opera singers to do wagner eight times a week 
and honestly i am exhausted she says portia is a very big 
quite tiring part 
the blonde bigboned actress is bestknown to american 
audiences for her portrayal of mirabehn mahatma gandhis acolyte 
in the oscarwinning movie about the indian leaders life and as 
sarah layton the indiaborn daughter of a british colonel in the 
1984 tv miniseries the jewel in the crown 
james first experience in merchant came while playing 
jessica shylocks daughter in a provincial production 10 years 
ago in the english midlands city of coventry 
then she recalls portia struck her as a bit of a knowall 
now she finds her a miraculous character and attributes her 
shift in perceptions to halls direction 
with shakespeare he is the master he can tell you how to do 
it james says if i was going to see shakespeare for the first 
time i would choose a peter hall production he may not go for 
innovation but he does the play 
hall says he admired jamess natural musicality and sense of 
rhythm shesa very intelligent feisty actress 
james says the director encouraged her to explore the 
contradictions of a character who can seem dismissive and even 
racist one minute ripe with the quality of mercy in 
shakespeares celebrated phrase the next 
its tempting to iron those contradictions out so that 
characters become onedimensional in order to become 
recognizable james says as actors we always want to be liked 
its much braver to dare to be disliked 
she says portias complexities are part of her interest 
people say how can someone be as nice and as nasty as 
portia but were very often like that james says its much 
too simple to say portias any one thing because shes all of them 
its important to win an audience around through convincing 
them of the truth of the character 
merchant reunited james with hall who directed her as 
imogen in shakespeares cymbeline last year at the national 
theater she replaced sarah miles just three weeks before the first 
preview of shakespeares sprawling rarely performed late romance 
it was wonderful doing cymbeline knowing people didnt know 
it at all she says those who came discovered the play 
she also starred in halls first film in 15 years shes been 
away as the selfdestructive bankers wife she and costar dame 
peggy ashcroft shared the best actress prize at the venice film 
festival in september 
i had worked with peter peggy had worked with peter i had 
worked with peggy james says a lot of things about it made 
sense 
she and the legendary ashcroft now 81 costarred in the 
jewel in the crown about the end of british rule in india 
and the afterglow lingers on i get letters still from 
america they have jewel in the crown evenings watching it on 
video eating curries and wearing saris 
her training typical of many english performers was in the 
theater she studied at the drama center and did a stint as a 
dresser with the royal shakespeare company which was then 
presenting ashcroft in edward albees a delicate balance 
years in regional repertory theaters led to the london 
fringe and on to the commercial west end where she starred 
opposite julie walters in when i was a girl i used to scream and 
shout 
her first major screen part was in gandhi earlier this 
year she appeared with jeff goldblum in a new film comedy the 
tall guy neither that film nor shes been away has yet been 
released in the united states 
james will be seen later this year onscreen in the wolves of 
willoughby chase starring stephanie beacham from the colbys 
and dynasty 
next year she and ben kingsley her gandhi costar reteam 
for a twocharacter play lanford wilsons a betrothal which 
they first performed above a london pub three years ago 
james was born in berkshire west of london one of three 
children and the daughter of a cardiologist the product of a 
typical middleclass family she says she became an actress more 
or less against the wishes of her parents 
but if the spirits want you to be something you be it she 
says

shedevil is a revenge movie without sly clint arnold or 
chuck this time its roseanne barr who shows those vengeful gents 
the kind of hell that a scorned woman can administer 
barr is the dull slovenly accidentprone wife of ed begley 
jr an ambitious new york accountant with amazing tolerance for 
her many failings they include running their suburban home like a 
city slum and mismanaging their two overbearing children 
when the couple attends a gallery opening in manhattan he falls 
into the clutches of a manhungry selfadoring writer of romance 
novels meryl streep weary of her livein gigolo she decides to 
give the accountant her business and her love 
barr slowly realizes her husband has been led astray she boils 
with mephistophelean wrath vowing to rob him of everything he 
holds dear his family life his career his new love his freedom 
her methods are as farfetched as they are hilarious 
fullout farce such as shedevil requires a feathery 
directorial touch and the most delicate of playing susan 
seidelmans direction is on target most of the way maintaining a 
whirlwind pace that forestalls suspension of belief the script by 
mark r burns and barry strugatz is cleverly constructed though 
some of the comedy is misdirected example the spoofing of 
senility in a retirement sanitarium 
the movie is based on the novel the life and loves of a 
shedevil by fay weldon set in britain the novel was made into 
a critically acclaimed tv miniseries telecast by pbs 
the big news in shedevil is streeps emergence as a 
worldclass comedy actress she attacks the role of the vain 
foolish novelist with a skilled gusto that invites comparison to 
the great lucille ball streep is delicious in her cunning 
calculation and convulsively funny when her champagne world loses 
its fizz 
another revelation is ed begley jr heretofore known for expert 
character roles in films the accidental tourist and scenes 
from the class struggle in beverly hills and as the 
selfcentered doctor of televisions st elsewhere tall and 
clunky with unruly strawcolored hair he is the ideal foil for the 
marvelous streep 
shedevil marks barrs film debut following her rapid rise 
as a standup comedian and television star it would be nice to 
report that she scores another triumph alas she seems uneasy and 
tentative in her role as the vindictive wife as if wondering where 
the jokes are with more expert handling she can undoubtedly 
register on the big screen next time roseanne 
the orion release is rated pg13 for mild swearing and 
suggestive situations running time 99 minutes

how i got into college cbsfox video vhsbeta 8998 
rated pg13 
 
marlon brown a rather dim high school student who bombs out on 
his sats nevertheless sets his sights on getting into selective 
ramsey college to be near the girl he loves from afar jessica 
kailo scholar cheerleader and class president 
will marlon corey parker get into ramsey will he win the girl 
of his dreams will jessica lara flynn boyle get into ramsey 
a high school guidance counselor might call how i got into 
college an underachiever 
consider the potential for a movie about getting into college 
the terror of taking the sats confusion over where to apply the 
dreaded college interview the agonizing wait for word of whether 
youve been admitted or rejected how i got into college a 
comedy tries to take on all this but does it with little humor 
drama or insight 
it has some clever spots a shady sat coaching service a 
mailman bringing a letter with a demonic grin students phoning 
home frantically to find out whether theyve received a fat letter 
an acceptance or a thin one a rejection 
but the movie often substitutes offbeat camera angles for humor 
and the oddcouple romance isnt particularly compelling by the 
end its clear marlon has more to offer than we thought but not 
much more

badge of the assassin vidmark vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
why would anyone want to spend 90 for a madefortelevision 
movie that has had its share of reruns since 1985 video companies 
seem to think consumers are either dumb or so hungry for movies 
theyll buy anything 
badge of the assassin is actually a fairly good cop and 
court room drama about the conviction of black liberation army 
members who murdered two police officers in new york city in the 
early 1970s it stars yaphet kotto as the investigating detective 
who must walk a thin line and james woods as the young and 
crusading assistant district attorney who prosecutes the black 
radicals 
but despite excellent acting the pacing is slow and the overall 
feel of the movie is television tepid the hard edge that could and 
should be there is missing 
under the biltmore clock from nelson for 7998 is another 
leftover from television this time its the jazz age as seen 
through sean young you can miss it

lute suites by johann sebastian bach london eduardo 
fernandez guitar 
compact disc enemies now have some new ammunition this 
recording not only reproduces fernandezs sound in crystal it also 
captures to a distracting degree the clicking zinging sounds of 
the mechanics of playing his instrument 
aside from the the suites this twodisc set offers 
transcriptions of assorted bach works for violin and harpsichord 
confined to a second disc timed at a pitiful 4459 
fernandez is also a little ungenerous musically his techically 
fine playing sounds not especially sensitive on this recording at 
least lines are not well shaped and dont always emerge 
independently and the phrasing sometimes sounds rushed

deaf dumb and blonde sire deborah harry 
 
deaf dumb and blonde is deborah harrys third solo effort 
since the breakup of the punk bastion blondie 
unfortunately harry has locked into todays pop format and the 
album lacks her snarling early 1980s cleverness 
two of the tracks including the lead single i want that 
man were written by allanah currie and tom bailey of the 
thompson twins and their influence permeates most of the record in 
the form of snappy beats and almost mundane lyrics 
on the few songs harry wrote with exboyfriend chris stein the 
dark brooding punk attitudes return harrys selfconfident lyrics 
and steins menacing guitar combine on several notable tracks 
lovelight a duet with ian astbury of the cult mixes 
paradoxical imagery with indian rhythms to tell of love in a 
cryptic mystical setting calmarie which harry sings partly 
in spanish is a lovely showcase for the higher register of her 
voice 
brite side produces a more tender side she is confident 
but not arrogant loving but not worshiping 
you have to wait for most of the record for a real knockout 
that comes with the last track the gorgeously arranged end of 
the run it is a partly spoken songpoem that tells of harrys 
beginnings when a torn tshirt made it all dangerous in it 
she says she doesnt like flashbacks in movies i like the 
story to proceed 
harrys story has proceeded but into whats threatening to look 
like pop dribble shes called her new music simpler and more 
aggressive simpler yes more agressive no

black artancestral legacy the african impulse in 
africanamerican art opened dec 3 and will run through feb 25 
before moving on to the high musuem in atlanta the milwaukee art 
museum and the virginia museum of fine arts in richmond 
the importance of african cultural traditions to the creativity 
of black artists in the united states jamaica haiti and the 
bahamas is the focus of the exhibit 
unlike the american and european modernists who borrowed the 
forms of primitive african sculpture early in the 20th century 
africanamerican artists tapped into the wellspring of their 
ancestral art to produce a new synthesis of the african and the 
american said richard r bretell director of the museum 
when an africanamerican artist makes use of snake imagery of 
woven patterns or of repetititve images derived from dance he is 
not merely borrowing forms but making a powerful statement about 
cultural continuity 
the exhibit features works by such artists as richmond barthe 
xenobia bailey sargent johnson ed love john biggers and derek

after a dozen years in movies chevy chase 
can still take a tumble to get a laugh but he is learning not to 
risk career falls because of bad advice 
the lesson hasnt come easily for the tall preppielooking 
comedian after creating a fallingdown sensation on saturday 
night live he made an impressive film debut in foul play and 
followed with bigmoney hits such as caddyshack national 
lampoons vacation and fletch but along the way he 
encountered films that might have submerged a less durable 
performer under the rainbow oh heavenly dog modern 
problems the deal of the century 
despite such disasters chase has survived and reportedly draws 
5 million per movie his latest is national lampoons christmas 
vacation which reunites him with vacation buddies beverly 
dangelo and randy quaid 
chase has finally reached a point where he decided he had to 
take charge of his own career 
i dont think theres a star around who doesnt feel that 
way he reflected the problem with that is that it can become 
too egotistical too warped by your own lack of introspection and 
perspective 
the world is different when youre a star it behaves 
differently towards you youre no longer just like anybody else 
around you you have to remember theres such a thing as compromise 
and collaboration on top of that of all the arts that im 
familiar with film is the most collaborative 
i was reading an article about bill friedkin the exorcist 
the other day he said i dont consider myself any more or less 
important than a crew member we all know thats not true of bill 
we know that he would like to think that and that he means it the 
fact is that his ego takes over and he gets crazy hes also a 
brilliant director 
chase cited last years fletch lives as evidence of why he 
needs to make his own decisions 
quite frankly i had a lot of trepidation about the fletch 
sequel it was in the middle of the writers strike i was the only 
one who kept saying no its not gonna work its not happening 
everybody at universal its going to be great dont worry 
me no its not working 
i hate that and yet i go along with it it ends up with me 
putting on a lot of funny faces and trying to mug my way through a 
picture it worked for what it was but i didnt think it was a 
good picture then i have to go out on a junket and promote it the 
whole time feeling bad about it 
chase doesnt feel that way about christmas vacation 
i think it can stand on its own as a picture he said 
its got a lot of the richness of the first vacation if you 
can call that stuff rich its written by john hughes as the first 
one was its directed by a very talented young director named 
jeremiah chechik whos got a great eye and a lot of warmth 
and its very physical more physical in the buster keaton 
tradition than ive ever done before i love that stuff 
chase said he participated in all the production decisions from 
the first meeting with executives from warner bros until the final 
print if he is so gungho on control why doesnt he direct his 
own films like clint eastwood and eddie murphy 
clints children are grown up eddie doesnt have any he 
pointed out im not prepared to take myself away from my family 
for the amount of time needed to direct a film i try to be as 
much a part of the directing process as i can without being away 
from my family 
its hard enough to be the star and see your family during 
that threemonth production period if you direct a movie youre 
looking at a year this is a very important precious period in my 
kids lives he said 
chase has three children they are from one to six years old 
and a fiveyearold they need the accessibility of their dad as 
well as their mom the fact is i need it too 
his resolve may stem from his own childhood i came from a 
divorced family and that was very tough i think it has affected 
me all my life i think it affects anyone whose parents are 
divorced i dont like it i dont like to see it happen its hard 
on the kids 
he was born into a wealthy new york family on oct 8 1943 and 
named cornelius crane chase his grandmother provided the chevy 
perhaps after the washington suburb an expensive education 
provided a bachelor of arts degree in english and a determination 
to perform after writing for mad magazine and the smothers 
brothers he fell in with the national lampoon people and ended up 
in the first cast of saturday night live

during the great depression eudora welty 
captured the many guises of poverty through her cameras lens 
and despite the despair the pulitzer prizewinning author found 
a natural joy as mississipians washed laundry by hand tended a 
bootleg still or slaughtered hogs 
unlike other photographers who chronicled the era such as 
walker evans and dorothea lange who intentionally illustrated the 
pain and bitterness of the period weltys photographs arent a 
misery index of any sort the southern writer found almost 
universally pleasant emotions in her unposed subjects 
her 1930s photographs taken as she traveled mississippi as a 
publicity agent for president roosevelts works progress 
administration provide solid evidence of the joy and pride she 
saw among even the most povertystricken residents of the nations 
poorest state 
welty 80 says her favorite face is that of a middleage woman 
standing with hands at her side in a tattered sweater the portrait 
is the first to appear in both of weltys photography books 
it shows such a marvelous character she said these were 
taken in the depression when everybody had absolutely nothing and 
she looked so valiant and courageous dignified and completely 
selfpossessed while she was so poor and in an old sweater full 
of holes 
one time one place a book of 100 blackandwhite 
photographs published in 1971 by random house focused exclusively 
on weltys depression era pictures 
her new book eudora welty photographs recently published 
by the university press of mississippi features 226 
blackandwhite images many included in the first book they 
extend into the 50s and across the globe however the 30s 
photographs of poor mississippians still dominate in both quantity 
and quality 
other photographs include architecture of the south and other 
american and foreign regions welty has visited and portraits of 
such writers painters musicians and sculptors as katherine anne 
porter vs pritchett elizabeth bowen eddy sackvillewest 
lehman engel hubert creekmore and jose de creeft 
welty author of the ponder heart losing battles and 
the optimists daughter for which she won the pulitzer in 
1972 said it was fiction that provided her with the most 
productive tool for dissecting every dimension of a human 
personality 
but in her depressionera photography she hopes viewers 
concentrate on the faces of her subjects and not just the 
overwhelming poverty i think they need to see the face in the 
midst of the poverty see the situation in reality and yet see the 
character the human being she said 
eudora welty photographs sells for 4995 it includes a 
sixpage foreward by novelist reynolds price and a 16page 
questionandanswer interview with welty on when why and how she 
took the photographs the interview was conducted by hunter cole 
and seetha srinivasan of the university press of mississippi 
welty insists she isnt a photographer and a review of the 
technical quality of her work will miss her point altogether she 
calls her pictures snapshots a kind of community family 
album she used a simple eastman kodak with bellows at first and 
later a more sophisticated rolleiflex 
she tutored herself in the art of photography and never thought 
of publishing the snapshots at the time she notes for 
example that many photographs inside buildings are underexposed 
because of her ignorance about light her picturetaking diminished 
after she lost the rolleiflex on the paris sabway in 1951 
they keep fussing at me at the university press when i say im 
an amateur but i am she said i was interested in my 
subjects not my expertise 
there are considerably more black people in the book than had 
been shown in other collections and more than one would expect from 
white photographers traveling the south welty says that is 
something that couldnt be duplicated today because in the 1930s 
there was more trust between blacks and whites and the trust 
dates the photographs more than anything else 
it was easy then for a moderately affluent white person to talk 
with an impoverished black stranger and ask to take his picture 
today suspicion and overtones of exploitation would prevent such 
encounters she said 
i didnt ever approach anybody and say stand still i want to 
take your picture it was all done on a human basis with common 
courtesy welty said what i would usually say was do you mind 
if i take your picture doing just what youre doing now i 
didnt pose anyone i didnt say stand here and do this thats why 
i think the pictures are so good they are just doing what theyre 
doing

canadian rockers blue rodeo are used to stealing 
shows on their own but in their recent movie debut they played 
backup band to country and western singer meryl streep 
meryl streep 
thats right and according to blue rodeo vocalist greg keelor 
the band has the academy awardwinning actress chauffeur to thank 
for the gig 
platinumselling artists in their native canada the five 
members of blue rodeo hope their cameo with streep in next years 
release of postcards from the edge and their new album 
diamond mine will propel them to similar status in the united 
states 
shes very good group member jim cuddy said of streeps 
performance on checking out of the heartbreak hotel 
she can sing very well shes probably kind of a boundless 
entertainer 
filmmaker mike nichols wanted a group that sounded like an early 
version of the band blue rodeo who performed with former band 
members robbie robertson rick danko and garth hudson on the 
canadian juno awards show earlier this year was one of five bands 
asked to submit tapes 
streep was listening to the tapes while being driven into new 
york city when her chauffeur raved about blue rodeos 1987 debut 
outskirts keelor said soon after blue rodeo auditioned and 
won the movie role 
it was a very normal kind of experience said cuddy whose 
band rehearsed patsy cline songs with streep before shooting the 
scene im sure thats not the typical hollywood experience this 
was one of the first times weve stayed in separate rooms 
blue rodeo traces its roots to the late 1970s when toronto 
natives keelor and cuddy rather violently crossed paths for the 
first time cuddy was a football linebacker who slammed quarterback 
keelor to the ground in a scrimmage nevertheless they soon became 
friends and began writing songs together 
keelor and cuddy moved to new york city in the early 80s 
looking to succeed with fly to france a rock band they admit now 
was unfocused fly to france shared rehearsal space with toronto 
friends who formed the cowboy junkies 
trying to make it in new york proved unsatisfying typified by 
the disappointment the pair heard from musicians who responded to 
their newspaper ad and found they wouldnt be flown to france for 
auditions cuddy said 
they moved back to toronto in 1984 and ditched fly to france 
they formed blue rodeo adding acoustic guitars to their collection 
and aiming for a countryrock hybrid inspired by the everly 
brothers and the beatles 
it was the music to do said the 33yearold cuddy it 
gives an artist a certain longevity a certain respectability that 
is not always evident in pop music to just chase pop music and 
chase an audience thats half your age is a little ridiculous 
its especially embarrassing if you get rejected by 11yearolds 
despite a twang in their sound blue rodeo doesnt feel 
comfortable in the world of country music and frankly country 
music probably wouldnt feel comfortable with a band whose keyboard 
player occasionally solos by standing barefoot on his organ 
i like the harmonies and i like the mournfulness of it 
cuddy said of country music ive always liked the details in the 
lyrics the focus on small details but ive never wanted to be a 
fullfledged member of country music its just not something that 
appeals to me i think were rock musicians borrowing from 
country 
like a certain famed british songwriting duo they admired cuddy 
and keelors styles are often a contrast between the sinister and 
the sweet 
cuddys smooth voice highlights country ballads like try 
which won a juno award for canadian song of the year in 1988 and 
new songs now and forever and house of dreams 
keelors vocal phrasing is a dead ringer for early elvis 
costello on the ballad of the dime store greaser and the blonde 
mona lisa and with keyboard player bob wiseman he creates an 
eerie doorslike sound on the new albums title cut 
the contrast can be jarring on record but makes more sense 
onstage when the pair harmonize said keelor 35 
its certainly an advantage in that you can cover a lot of 
ground in songwriting cuddy said we can approach things from 
a couple of different ways and just from a physical standpoint 
its nice not to have to sing all night 
blue rodeos sound for lack of a more appropriate word has 
been described as quintessentially american theyre not afraid to 
sing about their southern neighbors god and country is about 
oliver north 
theres also a sort of canadian tradition in the band like 
neil young and joni mitchell of writing a lot about america 
keelor said but its with a different perspective its like 
with a distance 
the modern world has a fascination with the united states but 
for us its even more tangible we speak the language we can 
cross the borders and work down here as legal aliens i did that 
for years 
but blue rodeos own success points out differences between the 
two countries 
in canada outskirts was the countrys equivalent of a 
doubleplatinum album more than 200000 sold and the band plays 
in concert halls in the united states theyre critical favorites 
but are largely unknown in the united states a doubleplatinum lp 
would mean that more than 2 million copies were sold 
at a recent blue rodeo performance in new york dozens of 
canadians packed the lone star roadhouse a cardboard cutout of a 
canadian mountie hung over the stage such questions as what 
province are you from replaced typical new york small talk 
the success we have in canada is pretty good for us keelor 
said wed like to do the same thing here a large part of it is 
just to keep playing and have people see us were fairly confident 
that when people see us theyll like it its a good show

kazuo ishiguro set his first novel in england but 
changed his mind and moved much of its action to nagasaki his 
second novel a critic wrote should be read by anyone wanting to 
understand the japanese 
with his third novel the remains of the day the 
35yearold novelist has turned his eye on his adopted country with 
an imaginative tour de force built around that most british of 
institutions the butler 
like jeeves that other famous butler of fiction mr stevens of 
darlington hall is a proud perfectionist but there any resemblance 
ends this is no pj wodehouse farce but a somber disturbing tale 
that has harvested ecstatic reviews plus this years booker prize 
britains most prestigious literary award 
ishiguros achievement is all the greater for the fact that he 
writes of a japan he has not seen since he was 5 and of an england 
that died a generation before him 
at 35 this nagasakiborn scion of samurai lineage is a 
thoroughly modern englishman right down to the soft south london 
accent he writes in english and says his japanese is too poor for 
conversation with other japanese but he keeps a photo of himself 
as a 10monthold baby pictured beside the family samurai swords 
and his prose has the subtlety and understatement one associates 
with a japanese watercolor 
he can vaguely remember grownups mentioning genshibakudan the 
atomic bomb but only now is he paying a visit to japan his first 
since his oceanographer father brought the family to england in 
1954 and settled in guildford a comfortably middleclass town 
southwest of london 
at school ishiguro recalls i learned to use my 
conspicuousness to make myself very popular they didnt know 
whether i should be heroworshiped or stigmatized he ended up 
kind of mascotized 
he backpacked through europe and north america and did odd jobs 
including a season as a fieldhand on royal grouse hunts he wanted 
to be a rock musician but ended up at novelist malcolm bradburys 
creative writing department at the university of east anglia 
he published some short stories then a novel a pale view of 
hills in 1986 came his dazzling second novel an artist of the 
floating world set in 1950s japan 
we are seeing here the emergence of one of the masters of 
contemporary english writing and if you want to start to 
understand the japanese begin here wrote paul barker in the 
financial times 
the novel told of a respected painter coming to terms with his 
lessthanglorious world war ii years as a propaganda artist for 
japanese militarists 
the remains of the day is also about old mens regrets in 
this case the butlers recognition that lord darlington the 
gentleman he served with utter devotion was a wellmeaning but 
wholly misguided sympathizer with nazi germany and a pawn in the 
hands of hitlers ambassador to britain joachim von ribbentrop 
the story begins in 1956 darlington hall has passed with its 
butler to an american owner mr farraday who kindly lends stevens 
his car and sends him off on a motoring holiday through western 
england 
as he drives stevens reflects on his life as a butler in the 
1930s and gradually his shell of professional reserve peels away 
to reveal truth after shattering truth 
here is a man so duteous that he kept serving drinks even though 
aware that his father was dying upstairs who was deeply loved by 
the housekeeper but never realized it and anyway believed 
marriage among servants disrupted household duties who without 
demur fired two jewish maids because his lordship thought it was a 
good idea who was deluded enough to believe he was contributing to 
world peace by serving the correct wines to the british and german 
guests who would gather at darlington hall to plot the appeasement 
of hitler 
stevens shame is not that he was pro or antinazi but that he 
never had an opinion either way so blinded was he by duty 
you see i trusted he tells a stranger when he finally 
faces up to the truth i trusted in his lordships wisdom all 
those years i served him i trusted i was doing something 
worthwhile 
thus ishiguro neatly reverses the cliche of what the butler 
saw by building a novel around what the butler didnt see and 
poses a crucial question for democracies everywhere how are 
ordinary citizens to make up their own minds when a group of 
people can shout for a long time we know what were doing just 
trust us and most of us in this country are in a helpless 
position we just dont know enough to argue back 
another achievement of the remains of the day is that in 
telling his story entirely in stevenss voice ishiguro displays a 
nearflawless ear for butler language 
stevens is fussy buttonedup comical even exasperating he 
reflects on the english countrysides calm beauty so different to 
the unseemly demonstrativeness of american and african 
landscapes on the essence of butlering not to be shaken out 
by external events however surprising or the importance of 
properly polishing the silver the state of the silver had made a 
small but significant contribution towards the easing of relations 
between lord halifax and herr ribbentrop that evening 
he has trouble with his american masters little jokes and 
teasings and takes to studying a humorous radio program for tips 
because the witticisms performed on it are always in the best of 
taste and to my mind of a tone not at all out of keeping with the 
sort of bantering mr farraday might expect on my part 
japanese and english societies share rigid structures that 
invite comparison but ishiguro resists the temptation he can see 
much that is strange bizarre and exotic in england but 
recognizes he must seem equally strange to the japanese who he 
suspects are slightly baffled fascinated and probably slightly 
threatened by him because multiculturalism is something theyre 
not used to 
but culturally people are increasingly becoming a mixture of 
things he says im an obvious example of that

its been a year of milestones for bill 
monroe the father of bluegrass music 
in october the stately 78yearold celebrated his 50th 
anniversary on the grand ole opry the live country music show he 
helped transform into an american institution in february he won 
a grammy award in a newly added category best bluegrass recording 
and he ended the decade the way he began it chatting with the 
president at the white house in 1980 he played his beloved 
mandolin on the white house lawn for president carter this 
november he was invited to 1600 pennsylvania avenue to meet 
president bush 
when the celebrations and awards and white house visits subside 
monroe can sit at his office desk and read a sticker pasted on the 
wall bluegrass finger picking good 
this music developed by monroe in the 1930s has been mighty 
good indeed to this legendary performer 
millions have heard him on the grand ole opry or in live 
performances hes entertained in every state and in several 
foreign countries hes sold more than 50 million records 
in 1986 the us senate adopted a resolution honoring him for 
many contributions to american culture and music 
he says hes lasted so long because he took care of himself and 
enjoyed singing and playing 
ive always liked work and ive been stout he said in an 
interview ive taken care of myself and never did smoke or 
drink work is something ive always liked to do i like to do 
something every day 
i love to play music and hear it i love to put the sounds and 
notes in there that i want to hear i want to do the best i can for 
my friends and fans sitting out there in the audience 
monroe a descendant of the fifth president of the united 
states is best known for his songs blue moon of kentucky 
uncle pen and mule skinner blues blue moon of 
kentucky which he wrote in 1946 was recorded some 10 years 
later by elvis presley 
i knew he was coming with another style of music monroe 
recalled one saturday night they had him on the grand ole opry 
he came around to me and apologized for singing the way he did 
i told him if it gave him a good start with his music and 
everything i was for him 100 percent so our friendship stood good 
all the way 
born near rosine ky monroe was the youngest of eight children 
and was orphaned by age 11 he was raised by an uncle who was an 
excellent fiddler and mandolinist by age 12 monroe was playing 
music at dances with his uncle and perfecting his tenor voice that 
was to enthrall millions for years to come 
down through the years he taught bluegrass music the string 
music of guitars banjos fiddles and mandolins to disciples such 
as lester flatt and earl scruggs who played in his band the 
bluegrass boys 
monroe has recorded for mca records for nearly 40 years a 
rarity in the music industry where performers often change labels 
every few years 
theyve been a big help to me and we work together good he 
said his most recent album is bill monroe and the bluegrass boys 
live at the opry 
he still performs 100 times a year at bluegrass festivals 
country music shows and the like in his office is a lined white 
sheet of paper with a place on each line for the date and the city 
hes booked in even after more than 50 years on the road he still 
finds travel inspirational 
i like to see the hills and mountains and valleys and how they 
take care of the land and everything monroe said 
hes been blessed with good health and a steely determination to 
keep his music alive when he was diagnosed with colon cancer in 
the early 1980s he fought it with the spirit he shows as his 
nimble fingers dance along the neck of his mandolin 
the doctor said i whipped the cancer out monroe said

keeping up with the changing times of frontiers falling 
european winter resorts are reaching out across borders to create 
sprawling international and interconnected networks of runs where 
you can cruise for days without skiing in the same tracks 
in switzerland you can board a cog railway up to trafficfree 
zermatt buckle up your skis before taking a longdistance lift and 
never remove them until lunchtime spaghetti at the italian resort 
of cervinia 
or you can ski through 250 miles of runs on the francoitalian 
milky way starting in europes oldest resort at sestriere 
owned by the fiat auto conglomerate keep on your skis through 
three series of peaks and valleys and finally reach the french area 
of montgenevre before gliding back to italy using more than 100 
different lifts 
at frances chamonix the foot of mont blanc highest summit of 
the alps you can board three cable cars over glaciers and wind 
your way down to courmayeur on the italian side 
or you can pole across the french side of the famous st 
bernard and schuss down to italy to a waiting minibus which will 
take you back to france through a tunnel under the mountain 
crossing borders sometimes even without a passport has 
become a routine way of life for skiing europeans whose middle 
class has made the winter vacation and the snow weekend a 
normal occurrence 
parents think nothing of suiting up their children with designer 
clothes and new skis for more than 1000 so they can enjoy a week 
with their classmates at the mountain most city dwellers even 
hundreds of miles away from a nearby mountain avidly tune in to 
the snow reports and take a few days off from work as fast as the 
ski rack can be fastened atop their car 
for those who are bored with the lift lines up and the whizzing 
down for the next queue resorts are dreaming up a few new wrinkles 
imported from the united states freestyle skiing monoski and 
snowboard are big in france with special instruction classes 
daring mountaineers offer deltaplaning in every alpine resort 
while even sleddogging is taught by a veteran of the famous alaska 
race in italys pontedilegnotonale 
costume parties even outside the carnival period or torchlit 
descents in the starlit nights with instructors take place weekly 
throughout austria italy switzerland and west germany 
finally crosscountry skiing has caught on not just for the 
over60s but for young children encouraged by low equipment 
rental fees 
most europeans however dream of the great runs of the bigname 
resorts 
cortina dampezzo site of the 1956 winter olympics snuggles 
deep in the italian dolomites offering an array of 11 valleys and 
660 miles of tracks with a large part kept skiable by artifical 
snow machines 
val disere in france with tignes and super tignes now 
bristles with highrises and hitech lifts allowing glacier skiing 
late into the spring 
nearby albertville will host the 1992 winter olympics which 
former world champion jean claude killy has been promoting around 
the world 
switzerland celebrating its 700th anniversary as a 
confederation in 1991 appeals to the posh set with stmoritz 
cransmontana and verbier only a couple of hours from geneva 
airport 
and austrians beckon from the start of november thanks to snow 
machines in their tyrol resorts of st anton and kitsbuhel which 
hosts world cup downhill and slalom races for both men and women 
next january 
but skiers should look east and south for the best bargains and 
the most challenging runs 
runaway currency devaluation and a strong tourist industry has 
made yugoslavia for example one of the most economical 
destinations 
last year while many european resorts wept over lack of snow 
due to a freak warm winter spanking new kopaonik in central 
yugoslavia frolicked in snow banks and 26 miles of broad pistes 
further north in slovenia just over the italian border kranjska 
gora site of many world cup races also began attracting 
costconscious mountaineers one of the greatest draws is the power 
of hard currency which can buy topofthe line skis for less than 
150 and beautifully handknit sweaters for less than 50 let 
alone hotel rooms for less than 40 a night 
the other new bargain areas are found mainly above the plains in 
spain baqueira beret in catalonia in the spanish pyrenees is a 
favorite of sportsman king juan carlos and his family and for 
skiers who like to pile in the paella rice sangria wine and late 
night flamenco high in the pyrenees 
nestled in the snowy peaks between france and spain the tiny 
republic of andorra offers half a dozen sites where the snow is 
still virgin and where the valleys echo with catalonian songs of 
its hardy shepherds andorras dutyfree status also allows for 
some of the best ski equipment and clothes bargains in europe

a decade ago tokyo completed a firstrate 
international airport which it confidently believed would serve as 
the gateway for a great influx of visitors 
the tourist boom it expected has not taken place largely 
because the airport is a long way out of town and many prospective 
visitors are turned away by chilling tales of the high cost of 
everything enroute to other asian cities they opt to stay over in 
one of the airport hotels and resume their journeys the next day 
if they are out for adventure and excitement they have made the 
wrong decision for tokyo is one of the liveliest most vibrant and 
culturally rich cities on earth ca vaut le detour as the 
french say it is worth going out of ones way to see 
the city is immense twelve million people but to the visitor 
strolling around its 23 wards it seems more like a string of 
selfcontained villages each with its own markets department 
stores cinemas theaters bathhouses and places of entertainment 
it is a city in a hurry yet its business gets done each day 
smoothly efficiently politely the streets are clean and it is 
one of the safest cities anywhere 
the city may be expensive actually it is not much more so than 
london but the human spectacle and much else is free trains 
buses subways and taxis get you to your destination quickly and 
with little fuss and mercifully english signs pointing the way 
proliferate 
what astonishes the firsttime visitor is the discovery that 
tokyo while giving ample evidence of its oriental roots also is a 
great center of western culture 
kabuki and noh the classical theater dazzle the newcomer along 
with bunraku the centuriesold art of the puppet thanks to 
tokyos prosperity they flourish as never before but their appeal 
to japanese is miniscule compared to the powerful attraction of 
western music both popular and classical dance and opera no 
city has so many symphony orchestras ballet companies or fulltime 
opera troupes there are five or six of each playing to full houses 
most of the time 
yet this hardly slakes the cultural thirst to accomodate it 
japanese impresarios spend millions each year to bring the best 
they can offer to tokyo and the prices are indeed daunting the 
equivalent of three hundred dollars for a ticket is not unusual 
despite this most performances are sold out months in advance 
devotees of jazz rock punk heavy metal country and western 
and just plain pop music pay less to hear their heroes and heroines 
because there are more of them the homegrown product with the 
exception of popular singing is inferior but the ravenous tokyo 
appetite for the loudest funkiest and best the west can offer is 
regularly satisfied by famous bands and singers 
art lovers can walk their feet off in tokyos more than fifty 
galleries and museums many of which contain masterpieces of asian 
american and european painting and sculpture there is something 
for nearly every taste from rembrandt to andy warhol 
if there were any doubts about tokyos standing in the world of 
culture they were dispelled when the great french museum the 
louvre twice consented to part temporarily with two of its 
treasures leonardo da vincis enigmatic mona lisa and the 
celebrated greek sculpture the venus de milo displayed in the 
national museum they were seen by admiring millions and when the 
widely admired american painter andrew wyeth decided to hold his 
first exhibition abroad it took place in tokyo 
some of the galleries occupy space in big department stores the 
first posthumous exhibition of the erotic art of the spanish 
master pablo picasso took place in a department store reached 
through the kimono and lingerie displays 
because they get no tax breaks big corporations do not 
contribute to art and culture on the american scale but several of 
them own and run galleries of their own one of these is the 
idemitsu oil company which has one of the best collections of 
chinese porcelain in existence another the bridgestone tire 
company boasts a handful of rembrandts as well as other western 
masters 
the museum of western art in the ueno cultural complex houses 
the important matsukata collection of french impressionist art it 
also contains the second best collection of rodin sculptures 
anywhere a half dozen of the most celebrated of the matsukata 
paintings remain in paris confiscated by the french government at 
the beginning of world war ii as enemy property and not since 
returned 
prestige was the reason a big tokyo insurance company forked out 
forty million dollars to buy van goghs sunflowers recently it 
reasoned that it not only was a masterpiece but a giltedged 
investment it hangs in a special room of the companys 
headquarters where thousands of japanese have admired it 
prestige also was the motive of the owner of the new otani hotel 
in tokyo in persuading the celebrated french restaurant the tour 
dargent to open its only branch overseas on its first floor 
perhaps the most expensive restaurant in the world the tour 
dargent is one of several hundred french restaurants which along 
with those of other countries make eating out in tokyo high 
adventure they are managed either by french chefs or japanese 
trained in france 
so next time you go through tokyo throw caution and checkbook 
to the winds what could be more exciting than an afternoon visit 
to a museum a concert or ballet in the evening the kabuki next 
day then superb french chinese or japanese cuisine to top it off 
after all you only live once

wyoming is inviting one and all to take a 
step into its rollicking rowdy past during the states yearlong 
centennial celebration in 1990 
settled by rugged mountain men who revered the rocky mountains 
beaver pelts as highly as gold and later by cowboys tending cattle 
herds that once made cheyenne the richest town per capita in the 
world wyomings heritage is woven of the stuff that made the west 
wild 
justice once was dispensed with a short rope and a long drop 
and outlaws like butch cassidy the sundance kid and the rest of 
the wild bunch often hightailed it to the hole in the wall 
west of kaycee in central wyoming to avoid the gallows between bank 
heists and train holdups 
the outlaws the range wars between cattlemen and sheep 
ranchers and the lonely lives of cowboys riding the desolate 
plains in search of strays all combined to give wyoming an image as 
a wild place for the roughandready 
during 1990 travelers will be able to sample this life be it by 
viewing the states open expanses from atop a conestoga wagon by 
taking in the worlds largest rodeo at the 94th annual cheyenne 
frontier days in late july or by walking through the barracks at 
fort laramie where the cavalry once protected emigrants passing 
along the overland trail 
there will be plenty of westernoriented activities for people 
to participate in says becky evans community service consultant 
for the wyoming centennial commission 
and the activities will be found in just about every corner of 
the state as communities from cody to cheyenne spotted horse to 
smoot and mule creek junction to moose celebrate the centennial 
while the state that boasts of being what america once was 
wont actually turn 100 until july 10 the partying begins on jan 
1 and runs through the end of the year 
montanas centennial party this year gained nationwide attention 
with a massive and dusty cattle drive reminiscent of those run 
from texas to wyoming and montana in the late 1800s but in wyoming 
theres really no single eyegrabbing headlinecatching event 
instead the wyoming centennial commission is urging the states 
communities to mark the birthday in ways fitting to their 
particular heritage 
with that in mind for those tourists who want to step into the 
past there will be wagon trains and trail rides shootouts and 
rodeos ice cream socials and elaborate balls 
those who prefer to mix the present with the past will be able 
to take in an international centennial celebration in worland 
featuring chinese ice sculptures cheer on cyclists in the casper 
classic international bike race in casper or take in the grand 
teton music festival with 13766foottall grand teton serving as a 
backdrop 
a look at the mountain men who wandered the states rocky ranges 
in search of furs will be possible in pinedale in early july when 
the 54th reenactment of the 1840 mountain man rendezvous on the 
green river is staged 
the biggest individual birthday party will be held in early july 
in cheyenne the state capital tucked away in wyomings 
southeastern corner the celebration july 710 will include a 
reenactment of the arrival of the original telegram declaring 
wyomings statehood an ethnic festival recognizing the diverse 
cultures that call the state home and a fireworks extravaganza 
evans said 1000015000 people a day are expected to join the 
revelry in cheyenne which in the late 1800s was known as hell on 
wheels because of the harddrinking guntoting men who passed 
through the frontier town 
wyomings geography is just as diverse as the centennial 
celebrations although the eastern half of the state is mostly 
high desolate plains cut here and there by long narrow strips of 
mountain ranges the western half is internationally renowned for 
its grandeur 
secretary of state james baker brought soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze to jackson hole in september to conduct 
ministerial meetings in the shadows of the craggy snowcapped 
tetons just to the north of the valley is the worlds first 
national park yellowstone and its vast bison and elk herds and 
thousands of thermal features 
theres plenty for people to participate in 1990 evans 
says all they have to is contact us and well let them know

visitors who visit idaho during its 1990 
centennial have a unique opportunity to experience the theme that 
runs through the states history like a vein of gold mans love 
affair with the land 
the gem states 100th birthday party will feature a gamut of 
wild west celebrations in virtually every town and county and 
there is the added reward of traveling through eyecatching idaho 
idaho became the 43rd state on july 3 1890 
settlers traveled to idaho for its resources gold and silver 
endless stands of timber the rich volcanic soil 
people who came here were looking for something to exploit 
but not in the bad sense said arthur hart a member of the idaho 
centennial commission who spent 17 years as director of the idaho 
historical society 
one of the most involved projects in the celebration is the 
creation of a centennial park state officials insisted that 
monument reflect industrys role in opening up the wild territory 
to civilization 
mining attracted the first major influx of settlers so it was 
natural to locate the park around the old gold rush towns of custer 
and bonanza in central idaho 
those rustic ghost towns are a short jaunt off idaho 75 nestled 
in the pines along the yankee fork of the salmon river ore wagons 
rattled along the motorway toll road to the ranching community of 
challis where the parks interpretive center will be built 
we had two oregon trail parks but we didnt have any park for 
mining which brought them here in the first place hart said 
the oregon trail people passed through idaho but didnt think 
they could farm here 
within two hours drive from the centennial park are the granite 
crags of the sawtooth mountains the champagne whitewater of the 
middle and main forks of the salmon or the worldclass ski slopes 
of sun valley the resort retains the 1940s aura that attracted the 
worlds elite ernest hemingway gary cooper and clark gable to 
name a few 
the silver valley in the idaho panhandle historically has ranked 
as one of the top 10 mining districts in the world 
travelers intending to put in a busy day can visit the coeur 
dalene district mining museum in wallace idahos oldest standing 
building in the catholic cataldo mission built in 1853 or the 
lakeside resort community of coeur dalene 
cataldo was built by jesuit priests and local indians using 
wooden pegs instead of nails 
north americas longest gondola will soon stretch from the town 
of kellogg to the silverhorn ski area in the silver valley 
northern idaho remains a thick carpet of timber and once 
featured the largest stand of white pine in the world lumberjacks 
used to transport logs on the clearwater river to the sawmills of 
lewiston in gigantic wooden flotillas complete with tents for 
cooking and sleeping 
lumberjacks will chop saw and climb trees as lewiston showcases 
its logging heritage with the grand finals of the world association 
of timber sports in may 1990 
people from all races came to idaho to work the mines farm or 
build the railroads the centennial honors them all with 
celebrations or interpretive studies 
in the midst of world war ii in 1942 9400 japaneseamericans 
were relocated to the windswept minidoka relocation center near 
twin falls in southcentral idaho 
the japanese american citizens league plans to build an 
interpretive center at the camp 
basques from the spanish pyrenees migrated to the united states 
from the 1800s on to tend sheep bands boise is the largest enclave 
of basques in north america they plan their second jaialdi 
cultural festival in boise in june 1990 drawing basques from the 
west and europe 
when american explorers meriwether lewis and william clark 
passed into idaho through lolo pass in 1805 they met friendly 
shoshone and nez perce indian tribes who had roamed through 
northern idaho on spotted appaloosa horses for centuries 
they are two of the states six tribes that will meet for the 
first time in boise on july 915 for an all idaho indian expo 
to present their histories dreams and social issues 
the idaho centennial calendar lists more than 500 events next 
year from an idaho cowboy poetry gathering to a whistle stop tour 
of union pacific railroads steam engine no 8444 idahos 
statehood day celebration will run 43 hours from july 2 to 
independence day with a dizzying schedule of fireworks and parades 
former gov john evans said i want a celebration of one 
million meaning he wanted every man woman and child involved 
hart said were coming as close to that as we can

its hawaiis newest beach and one of 
its largest but it attracts no swimmers and few sunbathers 
except for naturalists or small groups of tourists who come for 
a quick look and snapshots its usually deserted 
kamoamoa is now the largest of the black sand beaches said 
reggie okamura assistant scientist in charge of the us 
geological surveys hawaiian volcano observatory 
the new beach was formed after lava from the eruption of kilauea 
volcano began flowing into the ocean three years ago 
more than a halfmile long and about 25 yards wide it is bigger 
than kaimu the famed kalapana black sand beach nearby okamura 
said 
kamoamoa was formed the same way all other black sand beaches 
are formed he said 
when the molten lava pours into the ocean the cooling effect 
of the water shatters the rock he said 
ocean currents then push the minute particles to shore he 
explained 
the 23mile coastline of hawaii volcanoes national park is now 
pocked with small blacksand beaches he said 
a 25foot cliff previously formed the shoreline boundary of the 
kamoamoa campground located six miles west of kalapana a village 
on hawaii islandss southeast coast 
now the wide beach with its steep slope to the water adjoins 
the campground 
the sand was pushed up against the cliff okamura said 
the cliff is now buried under the sand 
i think the beach enhanced the campground he said its a 
beautiful place to camp 
the campground is the nicest on the island but is not heavily 
used said jon erickson chief naturalist at the national park 
before the lava flow it was little used we get a few more 
campers now mostly island people who come to see the lava he 
said 
from the grassy palm treelined campground and the adjoining 
beach visitors can see the huge smoke and steam plumes which waft 
out to sea from the points where the 2200degree lava pours into 
the 6070degree water 
however the beach is not very inviting to sunbathers the sand 
formed by the lava particles is coarse with sharp edges on the 
larger particles 
it takes a lot of wave action to round out the particles 
okamura said right now its not very comfortable to walk on the 
sand barefoot 
we tell people going to see the flow to stop in at the 
beach erickson said on a normal day several thousand people 
visit the flow area but only 2025 percent visit the beach 
signs posted by the national park service prohibit swimming 
because of high surf and dangerous currents 
beaches began forming almost immediately after lava began 
flowing into the ocean in november 1986 according to erickson 
kamoamoa began appearing in midjanuary 1988 
most of the sand is from the original entry point into the ocean 
about two miles east kamoamoa okamura said 
lava recently was entering the ocean at four points the closest 
just one mile from the big beach he said 
kamoamoa is 1 miles west of the wahaula visitors center which 
was destroyed by lava on june 22 1989 
the new beach could disappear if and when the volcano the 
source of the sand ends its nearly sevenyearold eruption 
okamura said 
once the eruption stops who knows how long the sand will 
last he said the beach is steep erosion or wave action 
probably will take it away he said 
however no one knows when the eruption will end 
right now the activity is as vigorous as ever said 
erickson 
kilauea volcanos east rift zone eruption began on jan 3 1983 
lava from the puu oo and kupaianaha vents has flowed into 
residential areas on numerous occasions destroying 74 homes

the first tune the children of 
spruga seem to learn is that of the klaxons of the yellow postbuses 
that wind their way through the mountains above locarno at the 
northern end of lake maggiore in switzerlands ticino 
a child on his tricycle pedals fast toward a stranger and stops 
just short of a collision he sings out like a klaxon and pedals 
off another child restless on her mothers lap echoes the klaxon 
warning of the bus as it rounds a series of tight curves 
spruga indemini and their fellow communities wrapped high into 
the alps above locarno and lugano or tucked into the river valleys 
are groupings of gray stone houses with heavylooking gray slate 
roofs the gray cobbled streets are often stairs all look as if 
they had been and would be there forever geraniums and other 
flowers add a blast of color woods and pastures are all around and 
much of the year a sound heard even more frequently than that of 
the klaxon is that of cowbells 
at the foot of the mountains lie lake maggiore and locarno with 
palm and fig trees oleanders and flowers and accessible lakefront 
there are restaurants galore an old town and a lido on market 
day booths along its main street sell everything from kitchen 
utensils to raincoats to jewelry made in india the long arcade 
along the street is a sort of permanent market sneakers and 
scarves toys and teddy bears and food of all kinds including 
almonds that a smiling old lady dips in hot caramel 
the arcade is a splendid shelter on a rainy day locarno famous 
for its sunshine does have rain too another indoor spot 
demanding a visit is the museum in the castello visconteo a 
centuriesold restored castle whose exhibits range from jean arps 
paintings to roman glass bronzes and other artifacts from the 
first century 
as one dines at the trattoria da luigi takes the funicular to 
the shrine of the madonna del sasso or the lake boats to muralto 
luino and the like one sinks into the feeling of being in italy 
the names the flowers the sun the blue water the stuccoed 
buildings in pink and cream suggest the mediterranean but it is 
switzerland though the swiss didnt get hold of it for keeps until 
the 16th century locarno was a commercial crossroads and military 
base under the romans who called the predominantly celtic people 
they found there the helvetii julius caesar defeated them in the 
gallic wars and then made allies of them 
locarno also was the scene in 1925 of an international 
conference including france britain germany and a number of other 
nations that drew up a series of mutual guarantees known as the 
locarno pact supposed to create a spirit of peace and goodwill 
britains foreign secretary at the time austen chamberlain was a 
key figure at the meeting adolf hitler denounced the pact in 1936 
and remilitarized the rhineland chamberlains halfbrother 
neville later british prime minister signed another more 
notorious peace pact with hitler in 1938 at munich with similar 
results with czechoslovakia as the pawn 
but the average visitor to locarno lake maggiore and its sister 
lake lugano will probably save historical research for another 
time concentrating instead on the lake boats and the mountains 
heading south from locarno he soon will truly be in italy on the 
way he can stop at switzerlands brissago isles where a botanical 
garden has plants from subtropical regions all over the world 
australia china north africa the americas the mediterranean 
this is just a foretaste of whats waiting at the south end of the 
lake on italys borromeo islands owned since the early 16th 
century by the borromeo family prominent rich and devout 
charles borromeo who died in 1584 was canonized 
the garden at isola madre with its bitter orange mimosa 
egyptian papyrus and banana trees has five terraces and a palace 
relatively modest by 18th century palatial standards white and 
bluegreen peacocks stroll the lawns and pheasants are almost under 
foot 
on isola bella the gardens are more elaborate ten terraces 
surmounted by a multistoried sculpture with niches containing 
figures and sculpted scallop shells statues are silhouetted 
against the sky atop the whole thing is the sculpted family 
symbol a unicorn its baroque beautiful and blatant the 
enormous palace one guidebook quotes french author gustave 
flaubert as saying it could have accommodated 2000 people is on a 
par with the gardens there are a weapons and armor room a 
tapestry gallery a room where napoleon and his family stayed as 
guests and three theaters including a hell theater with 
marionettes symbolizing the environment and a twopipe organ to 
produce lugubrious sounds 
lying between isola bella and isola madre is isola dei 
pescatori a longtime fishing village which has narrow streets and 
stone houses but also a heavy overlay of tourists and vendors

hong kong virtually on the eve of losing its status as a 
british crown colony will become a part of china again in 1997 
the chinese have promised not to tamper with their new possession 
for 50 years after that but confidence in that promise has been 
severely shaken by the bloody suppression of the democratic 
movement on the mainland last spring 
in the meantime hong kong remains a tourists delight the 
colony consists of hong kong island a host of smaller satellite 
islands kowloon peninsula on the mainland and the new 
territories which extend all the way up to the border with china 
one of the more pleasant surprises awaiting a firsttime visitor 
to hong kong is the ease with which one can get from place to 
place the subways are swift virtually noiseless clean and free 
of graffiti instructions in both english and chinese are 
conspicuous and easy to read uniformed agents stand outside 
turnstiles to answer questions 
buses and trolleys big lumbering multicolor doubledeckers 
also can take you anywhere the top deck offers the better view of 
the passing scene and dont overlook the star ferry a small 
fleet that runs between hong kong island and kowloon first class 
is only 9 cents 
but the best way to get from here to there is by cab taxis are 
clean comfortable and airconditioned the drivers are polite 
friendly and informative best of all cabs are cheap a third what 
you pay in the larger stateside cities tipping is not expected but 
it is customary to leave some portion of your change 
equally pleasant will be the shopping bargains youll encounter 
such as jade in msny colors ivory both old and new batik and 
beautifully delicate cloissone 
cameras or electronics are not a good buy in the far east never 
mind that they are made there you can do better back in the us 
there is a multiplicity of places to shop check out ocean 
terminal the chinese arts and crafts center the yue hwa 
department store and stanley market on the far side of hong kong 
island 
look for the decal in the shop window that identifies the 
merchant as a member of the hong kong merchants association a 
pledge of value for money and dont overlook the night markets 
garishly lit outdoor areas that open when the commercial 
establishments close you can shop eat and shop some more 
when you tear yourself from your shopping spree you will want 
to eat youll find chicken duck pork and denizens of the deep in 
varieties you may never have heard of service decor and 
preparation of dishes are impeccable 
your hotel will help you find good restaurants and will make 
reservations for you some good examples the man wah restaurant in 
the mandarin oriental hotel the korean barbecue house the royal 
thai and near the chinese border in the new territories the yucca 
de lac 
like most major cities hong kong is full of things to see and 
do but if you are pressed for time there is one absolute must 
victoria peak the peak is the highest point on hong kong island 
and is the vantage point for one of the most dazzling views in the 
world it is reachable by bus or taxi but the most enjoyable way 
to get there is the tram to the peak 
the view is spectacular at night when the jeweled city and 
harbor are spread out at your feet but it is equally spellbinding 
in the daytime when a clear blue sky forms a canopy over the 
noonday splendor of the city

if youre looking for a ride on the 
wild side look north 
not only do the adirondack mountains offer the largest 
wilderness area in the united states adirondack park encompasses 
some 6 million acres they are home to three of the wildest rides 
imaginable 
there is only one place in the united states where you can pay a 
fee and take a ride down an olympic bobsled run lake placid 
officials at the olympic complex here call the bobrun the 
champagne of thrills and its easy to see why the only 
drawback is that the ride is shortlived it only takes a minute 
or so to make the halfmile run 
but even though olympians travel at speeds approaching 90 mph 
at 55 its sometimes hard to imagine youll arrive alive 
especially on the final turn where it seems as though the sled 
will slam right into the solid wall of ice bordering the left side 
of track 
the rides at the olympic bobrun which have been offered at 
mount van hoevenberg since the 1930s this year have taken on a new 
dimension with the addition of six new sleds capable of carrying 
three or four passengers along with the driver and brakeman they 
replace the old sleds which were built in the 1940s 
we needed to replace our existing sleds because eventually 
things wear out says jim lamy who designed the new sleds and 
also manages the bobrun the rides cost 15 and are offered tuesday 
through sunday from 10 am to noon and from 13 pm and even 
though they dont begin where the olympians do they dont leave 
out the two most famous turns in the sport everybody zigs and 
everybody zags 
just a few feet away from the bobrun sits one of the most 
amazing sights in all of sports the luge run watching lugers 
navigate the twisting turns of the icecovered course at speeds 
approaching 80 miles per hour on television doesnt do this sport 
justice it must be seen in person to be believed and even then it 
seems unbelievable 
but theres a cure for disbelievers yep you can take a ride on 
one of those tiny little things the europeans have the audacity to 
call a sled the only catch is nobody will share your fear once you 
start sliding youre on your own after a minutelong crash 
course on luging pay strict attention to your coach if you want 
but youll probably forget what he said on the first turn 
the first 10 feet arent bad but when you get to a 
horseshoeshaped turn called omega youll no doubt wonder why they 
didnt name the course that instead traveling feetfirst at 35 
miles an hour and unable to see exactly where youre going is 
somewhat unsettling but chances are youll be alternately saying 
to yourself i wish this ride was over i hope this lasts 
forever am i out of my mind or what 
nevertheless one ride is all it takes to see how easy it is to 
get hooked on the sport for 10 you can get hooked on saturdays 
and sundays from 1 pm to 3 pm both luge rides are subject to 
weather and track conditions so call first 5185234436 
not far to the west of the olympic complex sits mount marcy the 
states highest peak and lake tear of the clouds the source of 
the hudson river and the source of perhaps the most thrilling of 
the three rides 
the hudson gorge virtually inaccessible even today is located 
about 20 miles to the southwest in the first half of this century 
logging was big business in the north country the timber companies 
pulled out in the 1950s and since the late 1970s rafts have 
replaced the logs 
each april and may thousands of thrillseekers show up to raft 
the hudson which each year becomes a raging torrent by melting 
snow and releases from the abanakee dam in the village of indian 
lake 
adventurers can choose from 11 outfitters overnight trips are 
offered but the fourhour 16mile ones are the most popular all 
are made in 160pound rubber and fabric rafts that at first 
glance look too flimsy to withstand collisions with rocks and 
jolts of the rapids 
instructions for this ride are short and sweet but vastly more 
important because your life may be at stake if you make a mistake 
youll hear the following before you get on the river if you 
fall in and someone usually does roll on your back and get your 
feet pointed downstream if you get separated from the boat work 
your way to shore and well come and get you 
with the water temperature usually at around 40 degrees in early 
spring youll pray they wont have to come for you

tour operators recognizing the growing popularity of 
snowmobiling are introducing winter vacationers to the adventure 
of going where only a snowmobile can go from yellowstone national 
park to the north woods of wisconsin from interior alaska to 
canada 
there are more than 100000 miles of groomed snowmobile trails 
in north america according to bombardier inc quebec canada 
manufacturers of skidoo snowmobiles 
the company says snowmobilers in the united states and canada 
spend more than 32 billion on the sport each year including 
equipment clothing accessories and vacations with nearly 130000 
snowmobiles sold in the two nations last year 
one snowmobile vacation package is offered by deckers 
snoventure eagle river wis which includes an alaskan adventure 
among its us destinations this year there also are western tours 
to wyoming utah and montana and midwestern tours to northern

decker former snowmobile racers 
yellowstone adventures west yellowstone mont owned and

what you might call lowimpact tourism ecologically 
sensitive travel or adventure cruising is inspiring the travel 
industry to offer tour packages reflecting interest in the 
environment 
as one travel firm sobek expeditions of angels camp calif 
put it in announcing environmental adventures for 1990 in such 
places as brazil costa rica indianepal tanzania and indonesia 
we hope to translate enthusiasm for wild places into energy 
directed toward their preservation 
another organization overseas adventure travel of cambridge 
mass offers birding in remote rain forests of costa rica gorilla 
trekking in rwanda hiking in mount everest national park safaris 
in serengeti and treks in machu picchu national park in peru 
on an adventure cruise passengers take an active role in 
every aspect of the expedition says douglas ward executive 
director of the international cruise passengers association 
naturalists and lecturers are aboard each ship to provide 
background information and regional observations about wildlife 
because of the briefings lectures and a laboratory at sea 
there is a cultural and intellectual element not found on other 
cruise ships explains ward author of the berlitz complete 
handbook to cruising 
the adventure cruise vessel he adds provides elegant and 
comfortable surroundings for up to 200 passengers a highly trained 
and knowledgeable staff and firstclass food 
without traditional cruise ports to stop at the ship must be 
selfsufficient and capable of longrange cruising ward says 
many of the cruises use small inflatable rubber boats known as 
zodiacs to get closer to their wildlife destinations because the 
mother ships are too large to navigate some shallow rivers and 
tributaries 
developed by famed explorer jacques cousteau the boats hold up 
to 15 people and can penetrate deep into otherwise inaccessible 
areas 
as ward explains the adventure cruise ship is seldom 
alongside a dock and is more likely to be found at anchor in a 
small inlet or bay for use as a diving base in warm waters such 
as around australias great barrier reef the zodiac is ideal and 
is safe and unsinkable 
many conservationoriented travel organizations play an active 
role in supporting environmental preservation programs 
the overseas adventure group for example donates 40 per 
person participating in their kenya safaris to the rhina ark fund 
which helps finance the building of a fence to prevent poaching of 
rhinos 
on himalayan treks it uses no wood for cooking which helps 
prevent further deforestation and all trash is carried out of the 
mountains in addition a percentage of each trekkers fees goes to 
help maintain the trails and conservation programs 
and chicagobased classic tours international which offers 
packages including cruises down egypts nile river donates a 
portion of each tour program to organizations dedicated to the 
preservation of historic sites and the conservation of wildlife

billion on christmas gifts this year up 4 percent to 5 percent 
from last year according to a survey by the conference board

to spend an average of 335 on christmas gifts this season with 
about half of all families spending more and half spending less

battle lines in congress are already being 
drawn over whether and how to spend the money the bush 
administration plans to slice off next years pentagon budget 
on one side are lawmakers who say liberalization in eastern 
europe means the defense cuts should be large and who want to use 
the money to beef up education child care and other domestic 
programs that have been pinched in recent years 
if the tearing down of the berlin wall means nothing more than 
we put the uss missouri in mothballs we will not have accomplished 
much says liberal rep george miller dcalif 
arrayed against them are others who want to use the savings to 
reduce the 1991 deficit to 64 billion a goal universally seen as 
difficult yet one that is required by the grammrudman 
balancedbudget law 
there seems hardly any room for discussion that the 
defense savings go to anything but deficit reduction says sen 
pete domenici rnm ranking republican on the senate budget 
committee 
dangling somewhere in between are senators and representatives 
who will be wary of defense cuts that affect military bases or 
contractors in their home districts 
the light bulb in their heads says jobs says ellen 
nissenbaum a lobbyist for programs for lowincome people 
while congress just finished its 1990 budget work on nov 22 
the administration is already sketching out its spending blueprint 
for fiscal 1991 which begins next oct 1 that document will be 
presented to congress on jan 22 
defense secretary dick cheney is reportedly preparing budget 
plans that will pare up to 180 billion from planned pentagon 
spending through 1994 
even if carried to the maximum such cuts would reap little 
savings next year because of the nature of defense spending 
in any given year much of it is carried over from previous 
commitments such as an aircraft carrier on which construction 
began two years ago or is contained in difficulttobreak 
longterm contracts stretching into the future even laying off 
troops brings with it offsetting expenses such as retirement 
payments unemployment benefits and other costs 
because of that the consensus among lawmakers and lobbyists is 
the reductions are likely to rein military spending by no more than 
3 billion to 8 billion next year out of a nearly 300 billion 
pentagon budget the entire federal budget will be about 12 
trillion 
such savings are but a tiny fraction of the 40 billion that 
many on capitol hill expect will be needed to shave the 1991 
deficit to the grammrudman target of 64 billion 
the peace dividend isnt large and there are a lot of 
claimants says rep bill frenzel rminn ranking republican on 
the house budget committee 
although the defense buildup of the early reagan administration 
years left a lasting public impression of an evergrowing pentagon 
the military budget has shrunk over the last five years when the 
effects of inflation are considered 
the trend was considered likely to continue in 1991 even before 
cheney began considering reductions and eastern european countries 
began asserting more political independence from the soviet bloc 
house minority leader bob michel rill predicted a feeding 
frenzy last week by lawmakers eager to cut defense spending if 
the administration asks for a budget reduction 
but theres little question that the nations defense system 
its bases and the companies that supply the weapons food and other 
goods for them has a large base of support in congress 
even so the need for deficitreduction is likely to lead 
lawmakers to take a bite out of the military budget the fight over 
reaching the grammrudman deficit target is likely to also focus on 
elements that have been contested in recent budget years higher 
taxes which bush opposes and domestic cuts which democrats 
reject 
a responsible budget approach has to be balanced says rep 
leon panetta dcalif house budget committee chairman who has 
issued similar calls in the past with limited success

to konrad trojniar the pension dispute with 
his exemployer turns on principles of justice and loyalty but the 
opposing lawyers in the case of continental can inc are trading 
charges of racketeering terrorizing and coercion 
trojniar now 49 is among some 2500 former continental 
employees who are suing the company in a class action arguing that 
they were laid off to prevent them from becoming eligible to 
collect pensions 
in other words they werent loyal to us said trojniar of 
hinsdale ill i would like to get what i got coming 
last may us district judge h lee sarokin sided with them 
but the workers havent seen a dime as the company appeals the 
ruling and a fight has broken out over how much should be paid to 
whom 
in the meantime trojniar who was laid off in 1978 just two 
years short of pension eligibility is earning 550 an hour as a 
maintenance man at a chicago chemical company thats half of what 
he made feeding an aerosol can press for continental 
i gave them the good years so to speak he said 
in its appeal continental says sarokin improperly extended his 
ruling from one plant to 46 allowed workers to join the class 
indiscriminately and ignored previous case law 
the exworkers attorneys say the cost to continental could run 
to 1 billion the other side expects a settlement in the 50 
million range said a source familiar with court proceedings who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity attorneys said there was 
little progress on a settlement 
the dispute involving dozens of attorneys at prominent firms 
nationwide took a rancorous turn in october the workers filed 
papers accusing continentals owner peter kiewit amp sons inc of 
siphoning off more than 1 billion from continental to avoid having 
to pay a potentially huge judgment 
last month kiewit agreed to submit certain asset transfers or 
dividend payments to the judges review the company denies seeking 
to transfer funds to avoid paying a judgment 
the workers amended lawsuit also adds individual executives and 
kiewit parent companies as defendants on a claim of racketeering 
an attorney for the workers robert plotkin of chicago said that 
action was intended to hold the kiewit companies accountable for 
their subsidiaries responsibilities 
but continental attorney edwin c thomas said that accusing the 
kiewit companies and individuals of racketeering is a coercive 
terrorizing event designed to inflate the amount of money the 
workers would receive in a settlement under the racketeering law 
the defendants could be found liable for triple damages if they 
lose 
thomas also accused the lawyers of making the funds transfer 
allegation as a way to attack the company under cover of court 
papers without facing any slander or defamation charges 
the workers court papers said that from the end of 1984 the 
year of its purchase continentals net worth dropped from 15 
billion to 311 million by last march 
assets were sold to pay off loans for kiewits leveraged buyout 
of continental the court papers said in addition the workers 
contended huge dividends were paid to continentals parent 
amounting to 634 million in 1986 alone when net earnings were 93 
million 
but kiewit continental inc general counsel stephen bermas said 
assets were sold to pay off debt as in any other leveraged buyout 
and many of them were noncan related such as insurance oil and 
gas and timberland interests 
whatever transfer of funds from continental can that occurred 
were fully explainable by other good legitimate business reasons 
that had no relation whatsoever to this lawsuit he said

the supreme court today left intact a 124 
million award a leading accounting firm was ordered to pay to a 
water heater manufacturer 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by ernst amp 
whinney the accounting firm sued successfuly by bradfordwhite 
corp which makes water heaters at a middleville mich plant 
bradfordwhite a tennessee corporation in 1981 bought out 
another water heater manufacturer wl jackson of chattanooga 
tenn in connection with that deal bradfordwhite accused ernst amp 
whinney the accountants for jackson of falsely reporting 
jacksons financial condition 
the accounting firm had reported jackson was in financial 
trouble but bradfordwhite said ernst amp whinney concealed just how 
bad matters were and contended that jackson was on the verge of 
bankruptcy the lawsuit alleged that ernst amp whinney violated 
federal and tennessee securities laws 
bradfordwhite was awarded 124 million by a federal jury in 
philadelphia bradfordwhite has offices in that city 
a federal judge later overturned the award ruling that the 
verdict was inconsisent with some of the jurys own finding 
but the 3rd us circuit court of appeals reinstated the award 
last april 
the appeals court said there might have been some 
inconsistencies but there is no doubt the jury believed ernst amp 
whinney misstated jacksons net worth 
the appeals court also rejected the accounting firms claim that 
bradfordwhite waited too long to sue 
ernst amp whinney waived any such claim at the trial and cannot 
rely on it on appeal the 3rd circuit court said 
the case is ernst amp whinney vs bradfordwhite corp 89604

details of a new employeeled buyout plan for ual 
corp are expected to be presented this week to at least one of 
united airlines three major unions union officials said 
the move would follow ongoing negotiations between ual and 
unions for uniteds flight attendants pilots and machinists aimed 
at refashioning a bid for the parent company 
expectations that a revised bid would be forthcoming sent ual 
stock sharply higher this morning it surged 5 to 179 a share by 
noon on the new york stock exchange adding to fridays jump of 
1250 
negotiations have taken place with all three unions since the 
new yorkbased investment group coniston partners last month began 
proceedings to oust 13 of the companys 15 directors united 
spokesman russell mack said sunday 
in a recorded message to employees the flight attendants on 
friday said that negotiations between their union and company 
negotiators would resume wednesday 
at the meeting top united management is expected to present 
us with details of a new employee ownership plan with similar 
presentations expected in meetings with the pilots and machinists 
the recording said 
patricia friend outgoing president of the flight attendants 
union said today she did not know when those meetings are 
scheduled and spokesmen for the other two unions could not be 
reached early today to comment 
ms friend said that while a revised buyout plan may be 
presented at wednesdays meeting were a long way away from an 
agreement that would require a vote 
mack declined to comment on whether an offer would be presented 
to the flight attendants or other employees this week 
louis marckesano of the philadelphia brokerage janney 
montgomery scott inc said the odds are pretty good that ual 
is working quickly to wrap up a new deal with employees 
a previous buyout attempt led by pilots senior management and 
british airways plc failed in october when bank financing fell 
through for the 300ashare 675 billion offer 
the resignations this weekend of two officers of the flight 
attendants union friend and vice president carol holmes could 
also mean a deal is near marckesano said 
the flight attendants have not been as cooperative under 
friend and holmes marckesano said sunday in a telephone 
interview this may be a sign that perhaps they are easing their 
stance 
mack said sunday in a telephone interview that discussions 
have been taking place since the coniston partners announced they 
are going ahead on the consent solicitation bid 
coniston has boosted its ual stake to 118 percent from 97 
percent general partner keith gollust said today but he declined 
comment on the buyout situation 
the group has said only that it intends to pursue an 
extraordinary transaction to benefit ual investors if it wins 
control of the companys board with the permission of shareholders 
friend and holmes announced their resignations to uniteds 
14000member association of flight attendants on friday saying 
the time has come for new leadership to step in to deal with a new 
esop and stalled contract talks 
marckesano warned however that consent from the nearly 
25000member machinists union will be key to any revised buyout 
offer 
opposition from the machinists to the previous buyout offer led 
in part to the banks decision to withdraw financing 
they still need outside financing even if they do strike a 
deal with the unions marckesano said its got to come from 
the banks in the form of loans and equity contributions or from 
individual groups such as the pilots

weekend reduced interest in the market 
there was not a lot of news over the weekend to stimulate 
buying interest said analyst steve freed of dean witter reynolds 
inc in chicago 
a lack of export demand for us soybeans and favorable weather 
in south american crop areas put pressure on soybean futures freed

factored into the market 
also word that the soviet union has bid for 400000 metric tons

cash prices for fed cattle this week a traditional period of low 
weak retail beef demand

united arab emirates oil minister mana 
said otaiba said monday his country was ready to limit its oil 
output but not to the extent demanded by the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries 
otaiba said the united arab emirates was willing to reduce its 
current output which he put at 26 million barrels a day to under 
2 million during the first half of 1990 
but he stressed it would not accept a quota of 1094 million 
barrels a day assigned under an opec pact reached last week 
he said the united arab emirates was willing to limit production 
to under 2 million barrels a day if the other opec nations abide by 
their quotas 
the 13 opec members agreed last week to set their output ceiling 
at 22 million barrels a day it left the quota for the united arab 
emirates which has not complied with its opec quota over the past 
two years unchanged 
otaiba also said he expects demand for opec crude to exceed 23 
million barrels a day in 1990 higher than the groups own demand 
estimates 
he said continued economic growth should keep demand strong 
moreover recent upheaval in eastern europe could help spur demand 
by touching off new economic growth there he said

the leader of the eastern airlines 
machinists whose walkout entered its 10th month monday says there 
is new dialogue with management but that his membership remains 
committed to the strike 
theres no way you can just blink away the trauma that people 
have been through said charles e bryan president of the 
machinists district 100 i believe that most everybody looks at 
it that theyve invested nine months and they dont want to lose 
that weve stayed solid so long 
bryan disclosed that he had a threehour meeting last thursday 
in washington with eastern officials and federal mediator harry 
bickford 
all agreed that nobody will put any spins on it bryan said 
we met and well have more meetings 
company spokesman robin matell confirmed the meeting with tom 
matthews easterns senior vice president for human resources and 
al gibson vice president for labor relations 
they agreed to maintain a dialogue matell said 
he wouldnt give any other details he said the meeting was the 
companys first with the machinists union since oct 13 
the latest session came the week after the air line pilots 
association and the transport workers union representing flight 
attendants called off their sympathy strikes they had joined the 
8500 mechanics and other eastern ground workers represented by the 
machinists in walking out march 4 when 1 years of federally 
mediated talks 
matell said management met monday with the flight attendants 
union will meet again friday and plans four days of negotiations 
beginning dec 18 the company is waiting to hear from a federal 
mediator on the next round of talks with the pilots matell said 
the pilots and flight attendants are in negotiations on new 
contracts and also on the return to work of their members 
bryan said the other unions actions didnt affect his unions 
strike he noted that eastern told the returning strikers they had 
no jobs for them and they would have to go on a waiting list 
i think it certainly was predictable that they are playing the 
hardest of hardball in the most arrogant way eastern has been 
very condescending saying we dont have any jobs but we might do 
them a favor and take some of them back 
bryan who contends that chairman frank lorenzo has been out to 
break easterns unions and cannibalize the carrier since his texas 
air corp bought it nearly four years ago has portrayed the 
unions struggle in terms of good versus evil he now draws 
comparisons to eastern europe 
bryan denied that his unions talk of going underground implied 
illegal activity eastern last week gained a preliminary injunction 
ordering the machinists to refrain from harassment threats and 
trespassing 
bryan said the union plans a range of activities that includes 
an organized effort to urge anyone associated with the travel 
industry to boycott eastern and texas air 
the company says it has 2800 mechanics including about 300 
machinists who have crossed picket lines and rejects suggestions 
of maintenance difficulties 
there were some 4500 machinists mechanics who struck 
bryan was interviewed here sunday after attending the florida 
democratic partys conference he chatted with house majority 
leader richard gephardt who urged him to keep up his fight because 
its important for this country

grain and soybean futures prices closed lower 
monday on the chicago board of trade as commission house selling 
dominated trading activity 
continued concern over the lack of export sales weighed on the 
market said analyst william biedermann of allendale inc in 
chicago 
indications from south america that soybean crops will have 
adequate soil moisture to get off to a good growing start was a 
major drag on prices biedermann said previously dry areas in 
argentina received rain during the weekend 
a big selloff by professionals holding long positions in wheat 
was due to a national weather service forecast of precipitation in 
the winter wheat crop belt analysts said the region had been 
plagued by dry weather in recent weeks 
corn futures traded in a narrow range as speculators liquidated 
to take profits as overall weakness in the market influenced corn 
prices biedermann said 
at the close wheat prices were 4 cents to 7 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december 404 a bushel corn was a 
cent to 2 cents lower with december at 232 a bushel oats were a 
cent to 1 cent lower with december at 143 a bushel soybeans 
were 1 cent to 4 cents lower with january at 572 a bushel

m danny wall resigned today as the 
governments chief regulator of savings and loans saying he was 
made a scapegoat to shoulder the blame for the entire thrift 
crisis and the record bailout of the lincoln savings amp loan 
association 
as he has done before wall insisted at a packed news conference 
and in his resignation letter to president bush that he did nothing 
wrong and leaves with personal integrity that will stand up to 
any scrutiny but he said the fact that he was the primary 
target of a congressional investigation would create a hardship 
at the office of thrift supervision which he directed 
wall complained about a steady stream of onesided information 
emanating from the house banking committee hearings concerning my 
handling of lincoln savings amp loan 
he specifically cited rep henry gonzalez dtexas chairman of 
the house banking committee whom he accused of resorting to 
corruption of the truth and abandonment of our historical 
devotion to fair play and due process in his effort to remove me 
from office 
gonzalez said wall had done the best thing for himself and the 
federal regulatory system the savings and loan disaster has 
been extremely costly in terms of dollars and public confidence it 
was essential that there be new leadership 
for nearly two months wall has been the chief target of 
hearings by the house banking committee into why federal regulators 
allowed lincoln to remain open until last april even though 
examiners had recommended in may 1987 that it be closed the 
bailout of the irvine calif institution is expected to cost 
taxpayers up to 25 billion 
wall has maintained there was not enough evidence to seize 
lincoln and has dismissed allegations that he declined to act 
because of political pressure from five senators who intervened on 
behalf of lincoln and charles h keating jr chairman of lincolns 
parent company american continental corp 
as i testified under oath neither political influence nor 
lincolns charles keating affected my decision on lincoln wall 
said in his resignation letter nor for that matter have i ever 
made decisions for political reasons during my tenure as chairman 
and director 
keating faces a federal grand jury investigation in los angeles 
and he is the target of a 11 billion fraud and racketeering suit 
brought by federal regulators 
wall said the simplistic efforts to find a scapegoat to 
shoulder the blame for the entire thrift crisis led various critics 
to join in the hue and cry raised by the house banking committee 
chairman for my departure from office 
wall testified for 10 hours before gonzalezs committee in late 
november following walls appearance gonzalez said of his 
testimony somehow it rings very hollow to say the huge 
regulatory bureaucracy could do nothing did nothing as the 
institution lincoln went down 
wall said he did not like running from a fight but he was 
unwilling to continue battling his critics at the risk of harming 
the bush administration 
the recent hearings consumed a great deal of our energies as 
we prepared our response and the prospect of continued hearings 
with me as the primary target would cause disruption at ots at a 
time when the agency staff needs to devote its attention to 
revitalizing the thrift industry wall said 
wall was chairman of the federal home loan bank board from july 
1987 until last august when its function as the federal regulator 
of the savings and loan industry was transferred to the new office 
of thrift supervision 
walls resignation came amid a flood of calls for his 
resignation or ouster among them gonzalez senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine several public interest groups and major 
newspapers 
time will indeed be kind to us wall predicted in a 
television interview nov 26 saying that two congressional 
investigations of the lincoln collapse would prove his decisions 
justified in the same interview he conceded making mistakes in 
handling the lincoln case but said he had no plan at this point 
to resign 
the senate ethics committee is reviewing the conduct of the five 
senators dennis deconcini and john mccain of arizona john glenn 
of ohio alan cranston of california and donald riegle of michigan 
the chairman of the senate banking commitee mccain is a 
republican the others democrats 
under the sampl bailout legislation passed in august walls term 
extends until july 1 1991 he was chairman of the federal home 
loan bank board and as part of the legislative package was named 
director of the office of thrift supervision which replaced the 
bank board as the regulator of thrifts 
the office is an arm of the treasury department

a revised employee buyout proposal being readied 
by ual corp executives could value the parent of united airlines 
at between 475 billion and 542 billion sharply lower than an 
earlier aborted proposal analysts said monday 
analysts said a new bid the successor to the failed 675 
billion buyout led by uniteds pilots union and management might 
be unveiled in time for consideration at a scheduled dec 13 
meeting of uals board of directors 
ual representatives are expected to present details of a new 
buyout plan to uniteds flight attendants union on wednesday 
the company has met recently with us and japanese bankers 
representatives of the united pilots union and coniston partners 
an investor group that is pushing for a sale or restructuring of 
ual 
ual stock rose 550 a share to 17950 in composite new york 
stock exchange trading adding to fridays 1250 a share gain 
patricia friend outgoing president of the united chapter of the 
association of flight attendants said monday that a revised buyout 
plan may be presented at this weeks meeting 
but she added were a long way away from an agreement that 
would require a vote 
nevertheless airline industry analysts and stockmarket 
investors speculated that the pieces of a new bid were falling 
rapidly into place chicagobased ual told its employees on friday 
that executives were working on a revised proposal for employee 
purchase of the airline company 
it looks like theyre really trying to put together a takeover 
deal here said stephen dexter an analyst in chicago with kemper 
financial services inc 
the 300 a share offer from the pilots ual senior management 
and british airways plc fell through after the group failed to get 
the necessary financing since then ual stock has traded sharply 
lower 
dexter figured the new deal would be for 210 to 240 a share 
another analyst said he had spoken with a united pilot who threw 
out a 220 number 
analyst samuel buttrick of kidder peabody amp co said lenders 
who balked at and doomed the 300ashare offer probably would 
agree to finance a deal at 225 
ual management is believed to be seeking strong commitments from 
lenders and the companys three major unions before announcing a 
revised buyout effort 
the earlier pilotmanagement bid failed in october when lenders 
refused to finance it citing the strong opposition of the 
machinists union the machinists represent about 25000 of uals 
70000 employees 
united pilots long have sought ownership of the carrier the 
nations secondlargest and are believed to be working with 
management on the new proposal spokesman hank krakowski of the 
united chapter of the air line pilots association declined comment 
monday 
brian freeman an adviser to the machinists union said no 
meetings between representatives of his union and ual had been held 
recently and he knew of none scheduled 
officials of the machinists union in washington and california 
did not return telephone calls 
ual spokesman russell mack said the companys financial advisers 
already had met with the pilots and were planning to meet with the 
flight attendants who also had not joined the earlier 
pilotsmanagement buyout group he said he did not know whether the 
advisers had met with the machinists 
the company is being pressed toward a sale or restructuring by 
coniston the new yorkbased investor group that is threatening to 
launch a drive for shareholder consent to oust 13 of the companys 
15 directors and create a fivemember board 
coniston has boosted its ual stake to 118 percent of the 
companys outstanding common shares from 97 percent general 
partner keith gollust said monday gollust declined comment on the 
buyout situation 
he said coniston had been in contact with ual and the unions and 
was holding back on launching its consent solicitation 
we are monitoring the situation closely gollust said in a 
telephone interview we will commence our consent solicitation if 
and when we conclude it would be advantageous

international business machines corp called a 
meeting for analysts tuesday amid speculation that the company was 
going to announce job cuts and possibly one or more facility 
closings 
ibm declined to comment on the substance of the meeting but a 
spokesman indicated it would be important 
ibm has a 40year tradition of no layoffs and a senior ibm 
executive last week confirmed that the company would stick to that 
however if the company closed an operation such as a plant office 
or distribution center many employees might choose to quit rather 
than accept a transfer to a distant location 
ibm normally reduces employment by offering financial incentives 
to employees to quit or take early retirement earlier this year 
the company began its third such program in three years hoping to 
trim 6000 to 1000 manufacturing jobs 
ibms stock rose 212 a share to 9925 monday on the new york

orders to us factories dropped 02 percent 
in october the second straight monthly decline the government 
said monday in its latest report on the sluggishness gripping the 
industrial sector of the economy 
it really corresponds with what is happening in the economy 
said david berson chief economist with the federal national 
mortgage association 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable manufactured goods fell to a seasonally adjusted 2339 
billion following a revised 1 percent decline in september 
september originally was reported to be unchanged following a 28 
percent increase in august 
the level of orders was the lowest since 2304 billion were 
written last july 
durable goods bigticket items that are expected to last 
more than three years fell 13 percent to 1236 billion since 
they often are financed through loans they have born the brunt of 
high interest rates resulting from federal reserve efforts to slow 
the economy and contain inflation 
in manufacturing the durable part is really hurting badly 
primarily because autos are doing so poorly now berson said 
the nondurable portion of the economy is not doing terribly 
because consumption spending on nondurables really is pretty 
strong 
nondurable orders were up 11 percent to 1103 billion led by 
gains in foods chemicals and tobacco products 
automobile sales have fallen steadily since car makers began the 
new model year in october by dropping incentives and posting higher 
sticker prices but despite the decline in auto sales 
transportation orders rose 17 percent because of increases in 
orders for commercial aircraft and defense shipbuilding 
excluding transportation however orders would have fallen 05 
percent without the defense category orders would have been up 
03 percent orders in the volatile defense category declined 121 
percent in october 
shipments of manufactured goods fell 06 percent to 2322 
billion while inventories rose 03 percent to 3719 billion 
if inventories increase without a corresponding gain in new 
orders it could signal production cutbacks in the future as 
factories attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and backlots 
machine industries led the decline in durable goods orders 
nonelectrical machinery dropped 67 percent with office and 
computing equipment accounting for nearly 40 percent of the drop 
electrical machinery orders were off 41 percent much of the 
decline concentrated in communications equipment 
primary metals orders were down 32 percent 
in the key category of nondefense capital goods a barometer of 
business investment plans orders rose 12 percent the first 
increase since a 59 percent gain last july

currencies monday as traders renewed their interest in the west 
german mark

marc chandler of money market services international in chicago

european neighbors particularly west germany chandler said

percent in october evoked little reaction among dollar traders

currency dealers overseas meanwhile were said to be closing 
out positions before the year end market volume tends to dry up 
toward the end of the year when dealers are hesitant to risk 
profits or add to losses 
dealers also were expected to remain reluctant to trade heavily 
while they assess the outcome of the weekends superpower summit 
and what it will mean for the future of the dollar and the world 
economy

international business machines corp called a 
meeting for analysts tuesday amid speculation that the company was 
going to announce job cuts and possibly one or more facility 
closings 
ibm declined to comment on the substance of the meeting but a 
spokesman indicated it would be important 
ibm has a 40year tradition of no layoffs and a senior ibm 
executive last week confirmed that the company would stick to that 
however if the company closed an operation such as a plant office 
or distribution center many employees might choose to quit rather 
than accept a transfer to a distant location 
bob djurdjevic president of annex research inc in phoenix 
predicted ibm might announce plans to eliminate about 20000 jobs 
paying for the streamlining program with a charge of perhaps more 
than 1 billion against fourthquarter earnings 
ibm has been competing with a layer of fat around the waist 
for too long djurdjevic said he said he thought trimming of 
sales forces was more likely than facility closings 
ibm normally reduces employment by offering financial incentives 
to employees to quit or take early retirement earlier this year 
the company began its third such program in three years hoping to 
trim 600 to 1000 manufacturing jobs 
ibms stock rose 212 a share to 9925 monday on the new york 
stock exchange the stock peaked at 17587 in august 1987

m danny wall under fire for his handling of 
what may become the costliest savings and loan failure in history 
resigned monday as the governments chief sampl regulator 
in his letter of resignation to president bush wall complained 
he was being made a scapegoat for the problems of the entire 
industry and denounced a steady stream of onesided information 
from congressional hearings concerning the collapse of lincoln 
savings and loan association of irvine calif 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee has blamed wall for allowing lincoln to remain open 
until last april even though government examiners had recommended 
in may 1987 that it be closed the bailout of the institution is 
expected to cost taxpayers up to 25 billion 
in turn wall criticized gonzalez on monday saying he 
resorted to corruption of the truth in trying to force the 
regulator out 
walls departure brought expressions of relief from congress and 
the bush administration 
gonzalez said in a statement i know this was a difficult 
decision but i commend him for taking the action so that the air 
may be cleared and we may move forward in dealing with the savings 
and loan crisis he made no mention of walls accusations 
another committee member rep charles schumer dny said 
wall deserves to go but added that he should not be held as 
the scepagoat for the thrift mess 
walls mentor sen jake garn rutah who brought him to 
washington in 1975 as his chief aide said wall was a man of 
unquestionably solid character and integrity but was a 
convenient target for the critics who sought a scapegoat for the 
serious problems in the thrift industry 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady whose department oversees 
walls office of thrift supervision commended the regulators 
decision to step down as public spirited 
he added we are beginning the search for a new ots director 
and are committed to a smooth transition and the uninterrupted 
continuation of the agencys important work 
according to an industry source three candidates favored by the 
treasury department are richard f syron president of the federal 
reserve bank of boston william h roelle who is in charge of sampl 
rescue deals at the resolution trust corp and william taylor a 
senior regulatory official at the federal reserve board now serving 
as an adviser to the administration board that oversees the rtc 
wall set no firm date for his departure saying he would stay on 
for a transition period he said he was looking forward to a job 
out of government but had no specific position in mind 
for nearly two months wall has been the chief target of 
hearings by gonzalezs panel at first only gonzalez called for 
his resignation but in recent weeks the committee chairman was 
joined by senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine private 
groups and several major newspapers 
neither brady nor president bush defended wall in public and 
according to government sources white house counsel c boyden gray 
was pushing for his ouster wall however declared to a packed 
news conference this has been completely at my initiative 
wall said he had offered to leave office last january but the 
administration which at that time was drafting proposed sampl 
bailout legislation wanted him to serve out his term through june 
30 1991 
the investigation by the house banking committee has also 
stirred up trouble for five senators who intervened with regulators 
on lincolns behalf before wall took office july 1 1987 
as i testified under oath neither political influence nor 
lincolns charles keating affected my decision on lincoln wall 
said in his resignation letter nor for that matter have i ever 
made decisions for political reasons during my tenure as chairman 
and director 
the senate ethics committee is investigating whether the 
senators donald riegle dmich alan cranston dcalif dennis 
deconcini dariz john mccain rariz and john glenn dohio 
violated conflictofinterest rules in their dealings with keating 
a phoenix ariz millionaire who was instrumental in obtaining 
thousands of dollars in political contributions to them 
keating faces a federal grand jury investigation in los angeles 
and he is the target of a 11 billion fraud and racketeering suit 
brought by federal regulators 
none of the members of congress suggested wall personally 
profited from his lincoln decisions but rep bruce vento dminn 
a member of the house banking committee said monday that wall 
put politics first and good public policy second and used 
excessively bad judgment 
wall said the simplistic efforts to find a scapegoat to 
shoulder the blame for the entire thrift crisis led various critics 
to join in the hue and cry raised by the house banking committee 
chairman for my departure from office 
he said gonzalez resorted to corruption of the truth and 
abandonment of our historical devotion to fair play and due process 
in his effort to remove me from office 
wall testified for 10 hours before gonzalezs committee in late 
november after the committee had already conducted five allday 
sessions to hear from walls critics the regulator attacked what 
he called the deliberately lopsided presentation during the 
hearings

m danny walls resignation monday as the nations 
chief thrift regulator came as no surprise in texas where much of 
the industrys problems have been centered 
politicians and industry officials said they believed wall had 
become a symbol of the industrys failings and as such had to be 
replaced as head of the office of thrift supervision 
rep steve bartlett a texas republican who also serves on the 
banking committee said danny wall was part of the solution not 
part of the problem but bartlett added i think the 
resignation was inevitable thats not to say it was fair 
although it was walls slowness in closing down lincoln savings 
amp loan association that was the catalyst for the current wave of 
criticism bartlett said i think danny wall would have been 
even without lincoln a controversial person because he was solving 
problems 
he left the savings and loan industry stronger than when he 
came in bartlett said 
wall was chairman of the federal home loan bank board from july 
1987 until last august when its function as the federal regulator 
of the savings and loan industry was transferred to the new office 
of thrift supervision 
the texas thrift landscape is much changed from walls southwest 
plan devised last year to bring new capital into the industry 
the mergers designed to take advantage of tax laws before they 
expired on dec 31 1988 have been criticized by some who complain 
the deals were too expensive 
under the plan steel companies home builders investors and 
other nontraditional thrift owners bought up groups of insolvent 
institutions and packaged them into new entities 
four of the five largest texas thrifts were created under the 
southwest plan 
in the final accounting which wont be done for several 
years these southwest plan deals might look better than they do 
today based on the cost of resolutions that the rtc resolution 
trust corp is experiencing said bill ferguson an industry 
consultant in dallas 
i guess he had just taken about all the flak he could take 
said hr bum bright whose bright banc savings association was 
seized by regulators earlier this year 
we thought he had fundamentally a reasonable program on his 
original southwest plan one that would work out that would be less 
cost to the taxpayers than the subsequent plans appear to be from 
our standpoint 
james l pledger commissioner of the savings and loan 
department of texas said danny wall had the toughest job in 
government because of the magnitude of the problems 
he praised walls attempts to focus public attention on the 
healthy portion of the industry 
he has been able to maintain a approach that recognizes 
that a large portion of the thrift industry is profitable and is 
doing well

the justice departments antitrust division 
monday recommended approval of a partial merger of the two daily 
newspapers in las vegas under a joint operating agreement 
assistant attorney general james f rill recommended that the 
las vegas sun and the las vegas review journal dailies be allowed 
to combine commercial and production facilities but continue to 
publish separate editions 
rill found that because of circulation and advertising losses 
the las vegas sun was in probable danger of financial failure 
and therefore qualified for the antitrust exemption granted by the 
newspaper preservation act 
under the law attorney general dick thornburgh must make the 
final decision whether to allow the proposed joint operating 
agreement to proceed 
if the agreement becomes effective las vegas would be the 21st 
city where daily newspapers operate under such an arrangement 
rills report said that financial records show that the morning 
las vegas sun has lost 13 million since 1981 as a result of a 
substantial decline in circulation and advertising in recent years 
circulation of the sun has shrunk from 58000 in 1982 to 52000 
last year while advertising linage has dropped from 2 million 
column inches in 1984 to 13 million in 1988 the divisions report 
said 
during the same period the circulation of the allday las vegas 
reviewjournal has increased from 93000 in 1982 to more than 
130000 last year 
the reviewjournals advertising linage has gone up from 29 
million column inches in 1984 to nearly 31 million inches in 1988 
the report said 
the reviewjournal which is owned by donrey inc holds a 
commanding lead in the las vegas daily newspaper advertising 
market over the sun which is owned by the family of its founder 
the late hank greenspun

economic reforms under way in czechoslovakia and 
poland should help speed the integration of the two economies into 
the international trading system senior officials of the two 
nations said monday 
zdenek jung deputy director at the czechoslovak federal 
ministry of foreign trade said the process of decentralization and 
elimination of state central planning was not a shortterm measure 
but a serious process of reshaping our economy and society 
speaking on the opening day of the annual meeting of the 
97nation general agreement on tariffs and trade jung said 
existing and planned reforms were designed to create the political 
legal and economic basis for czechoslovakias increased involvement 
in the world economy 
jung called on other countries to help economic liberalization 
in czechoslovakia by easing trade restrictions citing the example 
of european community limits on certain czech exports 
polands deputy minister for foreign economic relations dr 
janusz kaczurba said warsaw planned to renegotiate its terms of 
membership of gatt as part of the solidarityled governments 
efforts to build a liberal efficient and open economy 
he said poland wanted to normalize its status in the 
international body and adopt the normal commitments based on 
tariff concessions and other trade liberalizing agreements 
poland became a member of gatt in the late 1960s after giving a 
promise to increase its imports from other member countries by 7 
percent per year but it did not commit itself to other gatt rules 
such as those on import duties quotas and subsidies 
kaczurba told the meeting that poland had a new tariff schedule 
to conform with gatt rules and was in the final stages of talks 
with the international monetary fund on convertibility of foreign 
exchange liberalization of imports and the dismantling of domestic 
subsidies 
the meeting also heard thinlyveiled criticism of the united 
states for its threats to use a new section of its trade act to 
retaliate against countries accused of unfair restrictions against 
us exports if its grievances were not settled in bilateral talks 
ec official roderick abbot said the tendency toward bilateralism 
and unilateral solutions to trade difficulties were a danger to 
gatts multilateral system 
indias ambassador to gatt balkrishan zutshin appealed against 
this approach of contention and confrontation although he did 
not refer to the united states directly 
india was one of three countries singled out for potential 
retaliation under section 301 of the us trade act because of its 
restrictions on foreign investment 
texts of speeches to the closed meeting were made available to 
reporters 
in addition to hearing general observations on the world trading 
system the meeting adopted by consensus a report by a gatt 
arbitration panel that ruled against canadian restrictions on 
certain dairy imports a gatt official said on condition of 
anonymity 
canadas ambassador to gatt john weekes said he would not 
block adoption of the report though canada would continue 
restricting imports of yogurt and ice cream pending new rules on 
agriculture drawn up as part of the ambitious uruguay round of 
trade liberalizing negotiations the fouryear round is scheduled 
to end next december 
in the canadian case raised by the united states canada argued 
its restrictions were a necessary part of its program to manage the 
domestic supply of dairy products 
the gatt official also said that the united states had agreed to 
the establishment of a gatt panel to look into a complaint by 
candada against us duties on canadian pork exports 
members of gatt which draws up world trade agreements and acts 
as a mediator in trade disputes account for more than fourfifths 
of the worlds international trade

florida power corp has been fined 
50000 for allegedly failing to make sure safety equipment was up 
to standards at its crystal river nuclear plant the us nuclear 
regulatory commission said monday 
the alleged violations involved water pumps and valves that were 
of commercial quality and didnt meet federal specifications for 
nuclear safety equipment said nrc spokesman ken clark in atlanta 
in one case the impeller of a backup pump used to bring in sea 
water for cooling had only five vanes instead of the required 
seven for seven weeks that pump was not capable of fulfilling 
its safety function clark said 
the st petersburgbased utility which has 30 days to either 
pay the fine or appeal it has corrected all of the violations 
listed in the nrc fine clark said 
he said the alleged violations came as the utility was in the 
process of trying to upgrade its safety equipment to meet new more 
stringent guidelines imposed by the nrc last march 
we were making an honest effort to meet federal guidelines 
within the window of direction we had from the nrc jacobs said 
the utility was fined 100000 by the nrc in september for the 
alleged inability of some safety equipment to operate under 
postaccident conditions jacobs said

the no 1 gaming device maker in the world 
filed a federal lawsuit monday against a japanese company claiming 
the foreign firm is using three of the larger companys patents to 
make slot machines 
international game technology filed the us district court 
lawsuit against tokyobased sigma inc and sigma game inc a 
sparks nev subsidiary that makes the slot machines 
we believe that most if not all of sigmas slot machines on 
the market infringe on our patents said san francisco attorney 
john hughes representing renobased igt 
mike stefanik director of operations for sigma game said the 
company was unaware of the suit which claims its slot machines are 
copies of patented igt slot machines 
everybody uses these types of slot machines stefanik said 
so their reasoning behind the lawsuit is beyond me 
hughes said igt wants to force sigma to change its slot machines 
so they dont use patented igt slot devices 
igt also seeks unspecified damages to compensate for any 
business the company might have lost because of the alleged patent 
infringement hughes said 
these devices were patented for a reason because they have 
unique elements hughes said 
igt which had revenue of 140 million last year has a similar 
lawsuit pending against a different japanese company universal co 
ltd and its nevadabased subsidiary company universal 
distributing of nevada 
in that lawsuit patent infringement isnt claimed but igt 
alleges universal used igts trade secrets in manufacturing a video

a federal appeals court ruled monday that a 
british courts award of a 54 million default judgment against 
former automaker john z delorean can be enforced against him 
a threejudge panel of the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
upheld a lower courts ruling against delorean who tried to 
prevent enforcement of the british courts award 
last month in london however english high court judge peter 
gibson overturned a lower court order that allowed legal documents 
in the case to be served on delorean at his home in new jersey 
outside the jurisdiction of the english courts 
it follows that all subsequent orders made against mr 
delorean will fall away gibson said in his nov 24 ruling 
in october 1987 the high court of justice chancery court 
division in london awarded the default judgment against delorean to 
dsq property co ltd 
dsq property formerly delorean motor cars ltd of belfast 
northern ireland then sued in january 1989 in federal court in new 
york city to enforce the british courts judgment against delorean 
who had produced cars through delorean motor cars ltd 
the cars were distributed in the united states by delorean motor 
co which owned 75 percent of delorean motor cars ltd 
the new york federal court transferred the case to us district 
court in detroit where judge richard suhrheinrich ruled that the 
british courts judgment could be enforced against delorean 
delorean appealed but the 6th circuit appeals court ruled against 
him monday 
in last months ruling in england gibson said that in dsqs 
application to serve documents on delorean outside british 
jurisdiction there had been serious nondisclosures of 
matters including the existence of proceedings against delorean in 
the us unrelated to dsq 
mike morganroth a lawyer for delorean said monday night that 
the 6th circuit court ruling was moot since the british high court 
had set aside the judgment against delorean 
dsq property co ltd was created as the corporate successor to 
delorean motor cars ltd which went into financial receivership 
the british courts judgment and deloreans settlement with the 
bankruptcy trustee of delorean motor co which filed for 
bankruptcy in october 1982 resulted from claims involving the 
design of the delorean automobile 
the 6th circuit appellate court rejected deloreans arguments 
that his settlement with the bankruptcy trustee prevented 
recognition or enforcement of the british courts award in the 
united states the court also rejected deloreans arguments that he 
had not been properly served with documents to inform him of the 
british courts award 
morganroth said he expects dsq property to appeal the british 
courts ruling

d kenneth richardson a 37year hughes 
aircraft co veteran was named president and chief operating 
officer of the company monday and said he was confident hughes 
diversification away from military work will go well 
were not abandoning the defense sector we regard that as our 
duty to the nation but we feel that in the future most of the 
growth and opportunity are outside defense said richardson 
richardson replaces donald h white who retired dec 1 
like all military contractors hughes was looking at cuts in 
real defense spending even before the recent avalanche of change in 
eastern europe 
the satellites and defense electronics company responded by 
moving into such areas as telecommunications and simulation and 
training systems for commercial airlines it recently won a 325 
million contract to modernize canadas airtraffic control system 
and is bidding on a 210 million contract to modernize data 
processing for the bureau of land management 
im an upbeat positive sort of fellow and i think the 
companys future is very good said richardson 
richardson 58 joined the company in 1952 as a design engineer 
he worked on fighter weapons systems the phoenix missile program 
and the fa18 radar program he most recently served as executive 
vice president for operations after vice presidencies in the radar 
systems and missiles groups 
he becomes president as hughes a general motors corp unit 
finishes a sixmonth streamlining that includes layoffs of 8 
percent or 6000 of its 75000 workers another response to 
tighter defense budgets 
richardson said the downsizing had met its objective of reducing 
the company to the proper size for the next two or three years he 
said it was impossible to tell whether more layoffs would be needed 
later given current uncertainties 
if the government decides to cut the number of military 
personnel while upgrading technology we obviously are 
wellpoised richardson said 
were usually though not always in the forefront in defense 
electronics richardson said and many of the technologies we 
developed for defense are easily adaptable to nongovernment 
sectors
