a redfaced gov william donald schaefer is 
promising to replace seven trees felled by state work crews in what 
some residents of this washington suburb are calling the bethesda 
chain saw massacre 
im really sorry because we try not to mess up schaefer 
said wednesday surveying the seven tree stumps we made a 
mistake and were going to do everything we can to rectify it 
the blunder by crews working for the state comes at a miserable 
time for schaefer who is a third of the way through a ballyhooed 
campaign to plant 1 million trees as a means of enhancing the 
maryland environment 
i am tree conscious he reminded reporters 
they accompanied him on a visit with mechanical engineer arun 
vohra whose home had been shielded from a nearby roadway by the 
seven trees 
schaefer with state transportation secretary james lighthizer 
in tow apologized to vohra a 46yearold native of india who 
moved here three years ago 
actually it was vohras call to state officials months ago that 
started the painful chain of events 
vohra told the state highway administration he believed a pine 
tree on a public right of way near his property was diseased and 
should be removed 
authorities later determined that the pine tree was not diseased 
and had merely come under heavy attack from woodpeckers 
by that time though crews had visited the site on two 
occasions and cut down seven other perfectly healthy trees two 
pines three blooming dogwoods a giant lilac and a cedar that 
soared 80 feet to 100 feet 
the pine tree a few yards away was left untouched 
vohra was upset i acted a little crazy he said he called 
the governors mansion his state delegate his congresswoman and 
other state officials the ruckus found its way into the news 
reports and was dubbed the bethesda chain saw massacre 
wednesdays visit was friendly enough though 
vohra served coffee and snacks to the governor and his aides 
while schaefer surveyed the damage and pronounced it a result of 
poor communications misunderstandings and a failure to properly 
mark the tree that originally had been the target of concern 
we made a mistake we learned said schaefer 
the governor was glum about the massive cedar 
that was a great tree he acknowledged he and vohra posed 
for cameras standing on its stump

for garry kasparov it was the world chess 
title and something more it was the ultimate vindication of him 
and his flamboyant style over the surgical precision of his 
introspective rival anatoly karpov 
kasparov defeated karpov a fellow soviet for the fourth time 
in a world chess championship on wednesday by playing him to a draw 
in the 22nd game 
the half point each player received put kasparov ahead 1210 and 
let him retain the crown he had won four games to karpovs two 
the rest were draws 
at age 22 in 1985 kasparov won the title from karpov to become 
the youngest champion in history he defended the crown by beating 
karpov in 1986 and 1987 
on wednesday kasparov declared himself in measured tones that 
may belie the magnitude of the accomplishment a better player than 
his 39yearold rival 
i am a really good professional player kasparov said 
today i play chess better than karpov i can concentrate and do 
things a little better as i did during this match when i had 
problems 
interest in the 24game series was heightened by the dramatic 
contrast in style and temperament between the two players 
kasparov is talkative and flamboyant he plays with creativity 
and decisiveness and his politics are strictly anticommunist 
karpov is often portrayed as a colorless introvert who shys away 
from bold strategies i have two loves karpov has said 
communism and chess 
normally chess is a battle between two individuals kasparov 
once said but in my case with karpov its a fight between two 
different mentalities in russia i identify him with the system 
ive been fighting 
after winning just one match and drawing 10 of 12 games in the 
first half of the competition beginning oct 8 in new york 
kasparov rallied to three victories and six draws in the french 
portion played in lyon 
the turning point came in game 16 which kasparov won after 102 
moves during more than 12 hours over three days of playing 
kasparov won the last three times he played white but playing 
white again wednesday made him jittery 
i was really nervous because i didnt know what to do whether 
to play for the win or draw kasparov said afterward then my 
life became much easier when i had the worse positions and i had to 
fight for the draw and i obliged 
though kasparov clinched the title the two must play the final 
two games to determine how the 3 million purse is split 
if the series ends in a 1212 tie kasparov will still have won 
but the purse will be split evenly if kasparov gets another draw 
or win he gains 17 million 
on wednesday kasparov triumphed by maneuvering into position at 
the 40th move to keep putting karpov in check a perpetual check 
that trapped karpov in a nowin situation 
after the 43rd move kasparov simply offered his hand to karpov 
realizing the draw inevitable karpov looked back at his opponent 
and then shook hands giving kasparov the world title again 
kasparov showed little emotion and talked over the game briefly 
with karpov 
but he smiled during interviews afterward it is not easy to 
retain the championship for so many years he said 
wednesdays game had been delayed a week karpov had called a 
timeout saturday and the organizers again postponed the match by 
calling a technical timeout on christmas eve 
karpov won the championship in 1975 when american bobby fischer 
then the reigning wonderboy of chess refused to defend the title 
he won in 1972 
that anomaly allowed kasparov another dig 
karpov was the only world champion not to have beaten another 
world champion for the title he said 
at lyon after a draw or decision the two often discussed the 
play in a tone that seemed almost amicable 
but even kasparovs compliments imparted a sting i know him 
he knows me kasparov said you have to realize he is the only 
serious opponent for me i am talking chess with the no 2 in the 
world

early detection of poor blood flow to the heart 
may be an important step toward preventing heart attacks that 
commonly occur after surgery according to a report today 
researchers found that patients who develop poor blood flow to 
the heart a condition called ischemia soon after surgery are 
nine times more likely than other patients to suffer heart attacks 
within a few days 
early detection and treatment of ischemia may well be the key 
to decreasing heart attacks and deaths after surgery dr dennis 
t mangano said in a study in todays new england journal of 
medicine the potential savings in lives and medical costs are 
enormous 
of at least 1 million americans with coronary artery disease who 
have noncardiac surgery each year about 50000 suffer heart 
attacks soon afterward and 20000 die researchers said treating 
these heart attacks costs more than 500 million a year 
mangano conducted his study at the veterans administration 
medical center in san francisco it was based on 243 men with 
coronary artery disease and 231 who were at high risk of it all 
underwent elective noncardiac surgery 
fortyone percent developed ischemia in the first 12 to 48 hours 
after their operations and 17 percent suffered some kind of 
cardiac emergency while still in the hospital 
those who developed ischemia within two days of surgery were 
nine times more likely to have a heart attack than those who had no 
postoperative ischemia

the nation grew to 2496 million people in the 
1980s as more americans left the industrial and agricultural 
heartlands for the south and west 
the census bureaus first final figures from the 1990 
census released wednesday showed the pull of the sun belt 
remained strong despite efforts by the industrial north to promote 
growth and the collapse during the 1980s of the oil and savings and 
loan industries two mainstays of the southern and western states 
the census figures are used to adjust the number of 
representatives each state sends to congress so that political 
clout is in line with population the figures also determine the 
division of federal money among states and localities 
the numbers could change next summer when the commerce 
department decides whether to adjust the count some states and 
cities are likely to challenge the tallies whichever way the 
adjustment decision goes 
more than 6000 local governments challenged the accuracy of a 
preliminary count based mainly on the april 1 census taken by mail 
the census bureau responded with a series of recounts and an ad 
campaign urging people who thought they had been missed to come 
forward 
in new york mayor david dinkins criticized the count released 
wednesday saying it underestimated the citys population and as a 
result will cost the city millions of dollars in federal funds each 
year 
since at least 1940 the commerce department and the census 
bureau have systematically under counted americans of color and 
americans who live in cities dinkins said at a city hall news 
conference 
the census bureaus final national population total was nearly 4 
million people more than the preliminary number it released earlier 
this year 
five states all in the south or west grew by more than a 
fourth in the decade nevada up 507 percent alaska 374 
percent arizona 353 percent florida 334 percent and 
california 261 percent 
the six states having growth of less than 1 percent included 
some industrial powerhouses illinois up 04 percent 
pennsylvania 05 percent michigan 07 percent and ohio 08 
percent graingrowing nebraska grew by a bare 09 percent 
louisiana hard hit by the collapse in oil prices in the 1980s 
grew 08 percent 
five states lost population the biggest percentage loser was 
west virginia whose population dropped by 76 percent to 
1801625 other states losing population were iowa down 43 
percent wyoming down 29 percent and north dakota down 17 
percent the district of columbia also lost population 45 
percent 
americas population grew at a slower pace in the 1980s than in 
decades past 102 percent compared with 114 percent in the 1970s 
and 134 percent in the 1960s 
this years population count 249632692 for the first time 
included some americans living abroad the 1980 population figure 
226504825 counted only people living within the nations 
borders 
wednesdays release was only the first burst of what will be a 
barrage of census numbers detailing not only the number of people 
but their ages races housing situations incomes and a wealth of 
other data 
the last figures in the 26 billion census wont be released 
until 1993 
all regions had more people in 1990 compared with 10 years 
earlier the pacific mountain and south atlantic regions had the 
sharpest growth and the east north central west north central and 
east south central regions had the slowest 
the pacific states were the fastest growing region 234 
percent followed by the mountain states 206 percent and the 
south atlantic states 188 percent in the 1970s those regions had 
each showed doubledigit growth 
by contrast the east north central states grew a bare 11 
percent the west north central states 31 percent and the east 
south central states 39 percent those numbers represented a 
falloff from each regions growth in the 1970s 
other facts from the census release 
besides california states gaining representatives will be 
florida four texas three and arizona georgia north carolina 
virginia and washington one seat each 
states losing representatives will be new york three 
illinois michigan ohio and pennsylvania two each and iowa 
kansas kentucky louisiana massachusetts montana new jersey and 
west virginia one each 
the 1990 census counted 922819 members of the armed forces 
civilian employees of the federal government and their dependents 
living abroad other americans living overseas werent counted

nearly every day joseph c wilson iv the 
american diplomat in charge of the skeletonsized us embassy in 
baghdad telephones or visits the iraqi foreign ministry with 
standing instructions from washington 
it is to find out if secretary of state james a baker iii would 
be welcome for a visit before jan 3 to talk to president saddam 
hussein about releasing his grip on kuwait and pulling out the 
400000 iraqi troops there 
that session should it come to pass could be the last 
diplomatic encounter between the two countries before the crisis 
over iraqs seizure of kuwait erupts into war 
the reply to wilson with slight variation is either a 
repetition of jan 12 as the only acceptable date or no reply at 
all us officials said wednesday as the deadlock in arranging 
talks continued 
the iraqis dont have much to say one official remarked 
they just stick to jan 12 
wilson talks sometimes to nizar hamdoon an experienced diplomat 
who was once iraqs ambassador to washington and now is deputy 
foreign minister or sometimes wilson deals with a standin 
they talk also about routine embassy matters and until saddam 
relented according to us officials wilsons daily routine 
included insisting on release of the american hostages in iraq and 
kuwait and then writing a cable to washington about their plight 
on aug 6 just days after iraqi troops conquered kuwait in a 
blitzkrieg attack wilson was summoned to the foreign ministry for 
what he thought would be a meeting with foreign minister tariq 
aziz 
instead he was brought to saddam who told wilson that kuwait 
belonged to iraq and that the annexation was irreversible 
on wednesday wilson 41 and a veteran of 15 years in the 
foreign service telephoned hamdoon again 
there had been a report in an israeli newspaper maariv that 
baker probably would be in baghdad on jan 9 
wilson found the iraqis still insisting on jan 12 while baker 
has not budged from his position that he would make the trip only 
on or before jan 3 
there has been no iraqi movement on the question of dates 
sondra mccarty a state department spokeswoman told reporters in 
washington 
the israeli embassy disputed the report in maariv which quoted 
unidentified israeli diplomats 
we have no knowledge of anything of the sort embassy 
spokeswoman ruth yaron said she called the newspaper report pure 
speculation 
the disagreement over dates which shelved a dec 17 call by the 
iraqi foreign minister on president bush at the white house could 
soon become academic don davidson a white house spokesman said 
jan 3 remained the last possible date for baker to go to baghdad 
baker who is on vacation in houston has rejected jan 12 as 
too close to the jan 15 deadline set by the united nations 
security council for iraq to leave kuwait or be forced out 
baker proposed any time between dec 20 and jan 3 
weve offered 15 dates richard boucher a state department 
spokesman said we were forthcoming but they have not shown 
themselves willing to avail themselves of our offer

she sent christopher columbus on his voyage 
and opened up the new world for the spread of catholicism but did 
queen isabella i of spain have the stuff of saints jews and 
moslems are outraged by the idea 
the vatican is studying a petition that supporters hope will put 
the queen on the road to possible sainthood in time for 1992 when 
the church plans to celebrate 500 years of christianity in the 
americas 
one of the most significant figures in spanish history isabella 
commissioned the voyage of columbus in 1492 to the new world 
isabella is also remembered as the queen who expelled the jews 
and moslems from spain and for the dreaded inquisition that began 
during her rule with her husband ferdinand ii 
samuel toledano head of the federation of spanish jewish 
communities calls isabella a symbol of intolerance 
the vatican petition he said would reopen old wounds that we 
thought were closed forever 
but an argentineborn priest pursuing her cause says her 
contributions to unifying spain and spreading catholicism were 
immense and worthy of recognition 
she was one of the great women of history said the rev 
anastasius gutierrez who is serving as postulator to argue her 
case before vatican commissions 
gutierrez who is representing the spanish archdiocese of 
valladolid near the site of isabellas death in 1504 says the 
church in many countries of latin america has given its support 
the vaticans congregation for the causes of saints must decide 
if there is merit in a cause for a candidates heroic virtue or 
martyrdom and then send it on to the cardinals of the congregation 
and eventually the pope 
if approved the candidate would be declared venerable the 
first step up the ladder 
gutierrez said he is hoping for this approval by the fall of 
1991 but admitted the next step beatification may be more 
difficult 
we need a miracle that doesnt exist he said 
one miracle attributed to the candidate is needed for the 
declaration of blessed 
the petition appears to have touched a sensitive nerve at the 
vatican the sainthood congregation referred queries to the 
vaticans press office 
chief spokesman joaquin navarro insisted the vatican is not 
working under any deadline there is no special desire to 
complete it by 1992 he said 
jewish representatives in spain italy and britain have called 
on the vatican to shelve the petition for the time being 
i do hope the vatican will listen and not place an obstacle in 
the path of dialogue said tullia zevi president of the union of 
italian jewish communities 
she said isabellas reign destroyed a unique example of 
fruitful cooperation among jews moslems and christians and a 
move toward beatification would only encourage extremists 
hesham elessawy chairman of the islamic society for the 
promotion of religious tolerance was quoted in the times of london 
as saying moslems and jews were forced at the point of a sword 
to covert to christianity or die she is more of a demon than a 
saint 
the inquisition began in spain in 1478 and was originally aimed 
at discovering and punishing jews whose conversions were considered 
insincere it was later extended to moslems and then to any 
spaniard suspected of heresy 
meanwhile plans to celebrate the 500th anniversary of columbus 
arrival in america are under fire from native american groups that 
say the spanish conquest of the new world involved the devastation 
of their way of life 
the spanish conquerors transferred tons of gold and silver to 
spain from the newly discovered land especially from mexico and 
peru after dominating the natives in bloody wars 
the national council of churches which includes most of the 
leading protestant churches in the united states is planning 
counterdemonstrations to the catholic churchs 1992 celebration 
the council wants to call attention to what columbus did to exploit 
native americans

in perhaps his biggest political battle prime 
minister toshiki kaifu is trying to block attempts by his partys 
leaders to return scandaltainted allies to the cabinet 
analysts see the fight over a cabinet reshuffle expected no 
later than early next month as a test of kaifus lightly regarded 
political muscle and of the governing liberal democratic partys 
pledge to reform the political system 
it is going to be a leadership test for kaifu said 
keiichiro nakamura a noted political analyst who served as a 
secretary to the late prime minister takeo miki 
if he blocks the entry of scandallinked politicians to the 
cabinet it will show he exercises some political clout nakamura 
said 
if he allows any of them in the public will see him as only a 
puppet of the partys big bosses 
an obscure member of parliament at the time kaifu was chosen by 
party leaders to head the government in august 1989 after two prime 
ministers resigned in quick succession following the recruit 
scandal 
the party turned to kaifu because he was untarnished by the 
affair in which the recruit business conglomerate offered 
lucrative unlisted stock to influential politicians 
he since has kept tainted politicians out of his cabinet to 
preserve the mr clean image that buoyed his public approval 
ratings and gave him some leverage over party bosses 
but recent opinion polls show eroding support for kaifu because 
of his indecisiveness on how to respond to the persian gulf crisis 
particularly over whether japanese troops should be sent to the 
middle east for noncombat duty 
some party leaders seeing a chance to enhance their positions 
are insisting on cabinet posts for allies who they believe have 
been kept out of the political limelight long enough because of 
recruit 
the personnel debate has little to do with public policy 
among the recruittainted politicians mentioned as possible 
cabinet ministers are koichi kato the former secretary general of 
the defense agency and yoshiro mori the former education 
minister they were among the partys rising stars before the 
scandal 
but kaifu appears to back a new cabinet lineup that is not 
supported by top party leaders no agreement was reported after he 
met with powerful party secretarygeneral ichiro ozawa on 
wednesday 
toshio yamaguchi a senior liberal democrat legislator said 
politicians linked to recruit already have paid their dues by being 
kept out of the cabinet for more than a year 
mr kaifu needs to realize who are the real supporters of his 
administration he said 
but tadatoshi akiba a lawmaker for the japan socialist party 
the largest opposition party said reappointing scandallinked 
politicians would prove the governing partys reform plans are no 
more than a fake 
if they are serious about political reform how can they act 
so shamelessly he said 
akiba said resurrection of the recruit politicians would be 
especially galling at a time when a liberal democratic party 
legislator is under investigation for alleged tax evasion on stock 
profits of about 21 million 
distribution of cabinet seats is based on the power balance 
among the five factions of the liberal democratic party which has 
ruled japan since 1955 the groups which are nonideological are 
headed by senior politicians who aspire to become prime minister 
and to win plum government posts for their allies 
because kaifu belongs to the smallest group he needs the 
support of larger factions he therefore cannot easily resist their 
demands on policy and personnel matters 
the annual rotation of cabinet posts has become a party 
tradition because lawmakers expect to assume a ministerial post 
after serving five or six terms in parliament

in the politics of the future california will 
exercise more clout than any smokefilled room of politicians ever 
did 
california emerges from the 1990 census as a political behemoth 
with 52 house seats a population bigger than canadas and 20 
percent of the electoral votes needed to be elected president 
add together the congressional representation of 21 states and 
they still will total fewer than the delegation from california 
which swells by seven in 1992 the result of a 26 percent surge in 
population in the last 10 years 
the news is nothing but promising for republicans california 
hasnt voted for a democratic presidential candidate since 1964 
except for jimmy carter in 1976 no one has won the white house 
while losing california since 1912 when democrat woodrow wilson 
lost the state but defeated bull mooser theodore roosevelt and 
republican william howard taft anyway 
republicans can find more cheer in most of the other shifts in 
political power ordered up by the population figures released by 
the census bureau on wednesday 
the industrial northeast and midwest will lose standing in 
congress and the electoral college the west the south and the sun 
belt increasingly republican gain 
the political consequences advantage the republicans summed 
up stephen hess political analyst at the brookings institution a 
washington research organization 
the census sets the stage as well for brutal redistricting 
battles from coast to coast promising to generate nasty 
colleagueversuscolleague races in some of the 13 states where the 
number of house seats must shrink 
new york will suffer the biggest loss three seats and on the 
streets of brooklyn that could come down to a brawl between two 
democratic incumbents reps charles schumer and stephen solarz 
they may have to compete for a single seat 
it is no coincidence hess observed that schumer and solarz 
have built up campaign warchests in the milliondollar range each 
anticipating a costly battle or perhaps a race elsewhere maybe 
taking on republican alfonse m damato for his senate seat 
four states lose two house members illinois going to 20 
michigan to 16 ohio to 19 and pennsylvania to 21 
eight states will lose one each iowa down to five kansas to 
four kentucky to six louisiana to seven massachusetts to 10 
montana to one new jersey to 13 and west virginia to three 
among the gainers are florida up four to 23 and texas up three 
to 30 and one additional seat in the house will go to five states 
arizona going to six georgia to 11 north carolina to 12 
virginia to 11 and washington to nine 
but it is california where the gains are most dramatic in 
january 1993 that state will have more representatives than 21 
other states combined alaska delaware montana north dakota 
south dakota vermont wyoming hawaii idaho maine nevada new 
hampshire rhode island nebraska new mexico utah west virginia 
arkansas kansas iowa and mississippi 
all states except the six which now have only one representative 
alaska delaware north dakota south dakota vermont and wyoming 
will have to redraw congressional boundaries the purpose is to 
give each representative 572466 constituents or as close to that 
figure as possible 
the cry of gerrymandering rigging election lines to favor one 
party is sure to be heard in california the election of 
republican pete wilson as governor will serve as a check if the 
democratic legislature tries to squeeze out republicans already 
outnumbered 2718 
elsewhere black leaders in virginia alabama north carolina 
south carolina georgia florida and texas have served notice that 
they want the new lines drawn to create districts where blacks have 
substantial majorities and a chance to elect a member of congress 
we will oppose any friend or fight any foe to ensure that 
there is a black congressional district in virginia in 1991 jack 
gravely president of that states naacp announced last fall 
curtis gans director of the nonpartisan committee for the 
study of the american electorate disputed what he said was the 
widespread view of the census figures as a windfall for the 
republicans 
most states that picked up new seats did so because of growing 
hispanic populations gans said and he predicted that hispanics 
will become increasingly loyal democrats 
hispanics of the class that is expanding the population in 
california florida new mexico and arizona tend to vote 21 
democratic he said eventually thats going to tell probably 
within the next decade 
only in florida where cubanamericans favor conservative 
candidates can the republicans anticipate longterm gains he 
said

scores of rusting old ships float in 
ranks on an inland bay northeast of san francisco looming out of 
the chilly fog like ghostly oceangoing tombstones 
congressional critics want to junk the 66ship suisun bay 
reserve fleet but charlie johnston caretaker of the ghost 
fleet says the ships are ready to weigh anchor if the nation 
needs them again 
many of these ships go back to service in world war ii korea 
vietnam said johnston 40 the fleets acting superintendent 
hanging on a wall was a board with the name and location of each 
ship 33 of them world war ii victory ships all part of a fleet 
that once numbered 700 
pick one you call it he said to assure that a tour 
wouldnt steer the visitor toward a specially prepared ship a cia 
spy vessel is off limits though 
during the last session of congress the ships here and at fort 
eustis va and beaumont texas came under fire from the house 
small business committees subcommittee on regulation business 
opportunities and energy 
the taxpayers are getting repeatedly fleeced for these 
maritime cadavers said rep ron wyden of oregon subcommittee 
chairman william s broomfield of michigan ranking republican on 
the house foreign affairs committee described the ships as 
glorified rust buckets 
the array of ships local landlubbers call the mothball fleet 
is impressive from a distance and the spookiness that earned it 
the nickname ghost fleet is evident while approaching in a 
tugboat 
theyre tied in rows anchored at the bow and stern and joined 
to each other by gangplanks almost all are gray and rust stains 
their hulls 
they include the glomar explorer the cia ship built to retrieve 
a sunken soviet submarine since the secret voyage off hawaii in 
1974 the 618foot ship has been waiting for a new role 
we keep the explorer here for the navy johnston said 
explaining the glomar isnt maritime administration property like 
nearly all the other ships 
you cant visit the glomar but the meredith victory dubbed 
the gallant lady for rescuing thousands of korean war refugees 
is a good substitute 
rust was rampant paint chips littered the deck leaving metal 
naked to the elements painters used to keep busy on the fleet but 
money ran out in the mid1980s 
besides to us rust is no big deal as long as the metal is 
sound johnston said as he stamped his foot to show the steels 
hardness if it really got bad we could put another plate over 
it 
unlike the outside the ships interior was clean almost 
spotless and creepy 
charts books spare parts bedding and other items were left 
where they were in 1971 when the ship returned from vietnam the 
lack of interior rust is maintained by systems that keep airborne 
moisture low 
below deck it must look much as it did in december 1950 when 
it evacuated 14000 koreans as chinese troops besieged the city of 
hungnam five babies were born during the voyage that ended in 
pusan on christmas day 
built in 1945 the cargo vessel served in world war ii it 
became part of the reserve fleet after korea only to be pulled out 
for duty in vietnam 
could it happen again 
it would take a presidential act to call out the reserve fleet 
which is supposed to be ready to sail on 30 to 120 days notice 
the ready reserve 96 newer ships kept at several ports was set up 
to carry heavy military gear on five to 20 days notice 
much of the ready reserve including some ships from here were 
called up after iraq invaded kuwait in august 
sealift ships carried 90 percent of the desert shield 
equipment johnston said with obvious pride planes just cant 
do it 
the older ships are routinely sold for salvage and the money 
goes to buy newer vessels for the fleet its caretaker said 
to us he said a 20yearold ship is still new

luxembourg takes over the european communitys 
presidency on tuesday with war looming in the persian gulf world 
trade talks in disarray and europe in full transformation 
the grand duchy a tiny speck on the map with only about 01 
percent of the population in the 12nation community has a good 
track record in handling the rotating sixmonth ec presidencies 
jacques santer prime minister of the 378400 luxembourgers is 
convinced the mouse will roar again when his country takes over the 
communitys presidency from italy as 1991 begins 
during all of our presidencies we always came up with 
results santer said in a recent interview 
five years ago the luxembourg presidency paved the way for the 
single european act an updated constitution that pushes the trade 
bloc toward creating a truly unified market after 1992 
this time around new initiatives to create economic monetary 
and political union by the turn of the century have been thrust 
into santers lap 
the christian democrat plans to act as a mediator between the 
ecs powerhouses germany france and britain to finalize the 
blueprint for european unity 
because we are so small the others do not suspect us of 
having ulterior selfserving motives he said 
shoehorned between germany france and belgium luxembourg 
occupies a key crossroads on the continent straddling europes 
main cultures the romanic and germanic it is also wellconnected 
with both the rich north and poor south in the community 
the persian gulf crisis might prove the first test of 
luxembourgs mettle 
the ec has said it would not hold talks with iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz unless the united states first reaches 
agreement with iraq on exchanging foreign ministers visits 
if the ec agrees to talk with iraq that task would fall to 
luxembourgs foreign minister jacques poos 
during luxembourgs six months a lot of energy will be spent on 
two conferences one on economic and monetary union the other on 
political union to pave the way for a more unified europe 
disarray reigns on how fast monetary union should be achieved 
santer said 
he said calls for an independent ec defense organization are not 
realistic and it remains essential that we keep a partnership 
with the united states within nato the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
the partnership with washington has been strained in global 
trade where the ec has resisted us proposals that it reduce 
price supports and subsidies for farmers 
the agricultural dispute blocked an agreement in world trade 
talks held in brussels belgium earlier this month the talks are 
to resume in geneva next month 
santer stressing the progress that has been made in the other 
14 sectors covered by the trade talks said farming should not 
block an overall accord he argued in favor of a final deal that 
if need be excludes agriculture

violence erupted in three movie 
theaters showing the godfather part iii in the worst outbreak 
four bystanders were shot one fatally 
all the incidents happened on christmas the day the movie 
opened 
a man was slashed at a godfather screening in new york city 
and a woman was charged with menacing another moviegoer with a 
knife in a dispute over noisy popcorn eating in independence mo 
four people were shot in a long island theater when two groups 
of teenagers exchanged gunfire spraying shots in the movie house 
packed with about 700 people who fled in panic 
the shootout came about an hour into show after an argument 
escalated into a shouting match between two groups seated in 
different parts of the sunrise cinema theater nassau county 
detective sgt william cocks said wednesday 
a group of about 10 teenagers moved and surrounded the other 
group before opening fire cocks said the second group apparently 
returned fire 
when officers arrived the gangster film was still running in 
the virtually deserted movie house spent shells showed that at 
least four handguns were used the subject of the argument was 
unknown no arrests were made 
a 15yearold from new york city was shot in the head and died 
while undergoing surgery wednesday another teenager shot in the 
eye was listed in stable condition 
a married couple both 23 were treated for gunshot wounds to 
the arm and shoulder 
in missouri marilyn mcmahon said her heart jumped during a 
scene in the gangster film in which a knife is held to a womans 
throat but it didnt compare to the real thing later during the 
screening 
ada l young 58 of raytown was arrested as she left the 
theater and was charged with assault wednesday in independence 
municipal court 
maybe those things are true that you read that violence 
maybe begets violence mrs mcmahon said wednesday my heart 
was beating very fast for a long time after that 
mrs mcmahon said she was sitting in back row with her daughter 
and two of her daughters friends during an afternoon show while 
they ate popcorn a woman and her son turned around to complain 
when mrs mcmahon suggested they move to other seats they got 
up and walked behind her 
one of them grabbed my hair and pulled my head back mrs 
mcmahon said that knife was right there at the side of my 
neck 
mrs mcmahon said she jerked free and ran to the lobby to alert 
theater workers who called police 
charlie hobbs manager of the blue ridge cinema said he didnt 
think the incident was related to the violence in the movie 
if we had walt disneys bambi it probably wouldnt even 
hit the newspaper he said 
in the other incident new york police said a man was cut during 
an altercation with several men at a manhattan theater the victim 
was treated at a hospital no arrests were made and the cause of 
the fight was undetermined

in 1968 filipino seamen sailed a 
castoff us warship across the pacific for service in their navy 
in november the 48yearold vessel finally sank in a typoon 
the saga of the patrol ship nueva vizcaya which sank nov 14 
off cebu typifies the problems facing the navy the stepchild of a 
poorly equipped armed forces 
although a nation of 7100 islands with a longer coastline than 
the continental united states the philippines has the most 
primitive navy in southeast asia 
being an archipelago we must become a sea power or we will be 
powerless navy chief rear admiral mariano dumancas said in a 
recent interview the reality makes dumancas words seem comical 
the navys inventory consists mostly of world war ii 
handmedowns from the united states including the nueva vizcaya 
built in july 1942 and once known as the altrus 
the vintage ships have poor navigational equipment and 
inadequate antipollution maritime devices according to a secret 
navy report obtained by the associated press the report said 
philippine warships average 41 years of age compared with 19 for 
the indonesian navy and 13 for the malaysians 
its not safe or effective to have these floating coffins 
used admitted a senior navy officer who spoke on condition he 
not be named 
the demise of the nueva vizcaya which spent its last few years 
being towed from dock to dock because its engine was inoperable 
left the navy 22 patrol ships 21 transport vessels 85 small craft 
and 14 aircraft 
on the surface this inventory looks huge the classified 
report said in reality they have very limited operational 
capabilities and have become very expensive to operate and 
maintain 
the report admitted that in an honesttogoodness encounter 
the capacity of our menofwar to sustain as a viable naval force 
is extremely doubtful 
among its other deficiencies the philippine navy has no 
capability against submarines missile attack or mine warfare 
while the us navy has a formidable fleet of carriers 
destroyers and assault ships in subic bay 50 miles northwest of 
manila philippine sailors patrol their own waters with three 
wooden outriggers 
occasionally the navy must borrow private boats for raids 
against pirates and smugglers according to navy officers in subic 
countries in this region are modernizing their navies and some 
are in good shape said joris janssenlok naval editor of the 
respected janes defense weekly in london but this country is 
indeed deplorable 
since independence from the united states in 1946 land forces 
have traditionally received the largest share of the defense budget 
because of persistent internal security problems including moslem 
and communist insurgencies 
meanwhile filipino officials grew lax in building an effective 
navy because there was no immediate threat and even if there were 
they could always rely on the americans 
but the mutual defense treaty obligates the united states to 
defend the philippines against foreign aggression and not combat 
smugglers pirates or incursions by foreign navies 
the prolonged presence of the us military in our country 
made us neglect to undertake the necessary longterm steps to build 
our external defense over the years said sen leticia shahani 
chief sponsor of a congressional bill to modernize the navy 
dependence on the us navy is often illustrated during 
typhoons air and sea accidents and other disasters when philippine 
authorities turn to the americans because they lack the capability 
for their own search and rescue 
we have become too dependent on the americans said sen 
juan ponce enrile a former defense minister we have neglected 
to modernize our navy 
the psychological blanket that the us presence provides has 
resulted in giving less priority to buying repairing and 
modernizing ships 
last year the navy received 16 percent of the defense budget 
with the army and the philippine constabulary receiving more than 
half 
realizing the need to modernize the navy proposed an additional 
allocation now equal to 430 million to buy new ships over 5 years 
but inflation and the falling peso are threatening to increase 
costs beyond those projections 
there is an urgent need to upgrade the navy but 
realistically we cannot afford it said sen ernesto maceda 
chairman of the senate defense committee we have to subsidize 
rice fuel schools buy medicines basics first

a founder of the righttolife group 
operation rescue alleged that the hospital where nancy cruzan died 
is lining people up for euthanasia officials denied it 
ms cruzan 33 who had been in a persistent vegetative state 
for nearly eight years died at the missouri rehabilitation center 
on wednesday the feeding tube that had kept her alive since a 1983 
car crash had been removed 12 days earlier at her parents request 
approved by a judge 
im curious to see whos going to be next at this facility 
said the rev joseph foreman of atlanta the cofounder of 
operation rescue said he learned from hospital sources whom he did 
not identify that several patients are candidates for euthanasia 
don lamkins the rehabilitation centers director said one or 
two patients at the center have about the same extent of brain 
damage as ms cruzan did 
but i have never had any indication from the families of those 
people that they want to do that euthanasia he said 
ms cruzans parents joe and joyce cruzan fought a threeyear 
legal battle to remove their daughters feeding tube saying she 
would not want to live in a persisitent vegetative state 
the legal efforts led to a landmark supreme court decision on 
june 25 stating that patients like ms cruzan could be allowed to 
die but only if there was clear and convincing evidence that 
was their wish 
several of ms cruzans former coworkers then testified in 
state court that she said she would never want to live like a 
vegetable judge charles teel jr ruled dec 14 that her feeding 
tube could be removed 
making history was a woman friends and family members remembered 
as a free spirit who loved children and animals and had embraced 
life with joy until her car ran off the road as she returned home 
from work on jan 11 1983 
she lived life to the fullest pretty much all her life her 
mother said thats more than a lot of people do 
she was always the clown but not a smart aleck her father 
said and yet for all her orneriness she was just as cute as she 
could be 
foreman complained that ms cruzans family let a tragedy occur 
that holds grave implications for the future 
i think in the next few years you will see an entire industry 
spring up around putting people to death whom family friends and 
so forth have deemed to be no longer of use to anybody he said 
the family stood by its decision in a statement released at the 
hospital hours after ms cruzans death 
knowing nancy as only a family can there remains no question 
that we made the choice she would want the family said

president roh taewoo today named a 
new prime minister and reshuffled his cabinet in a bid to polish 
his partys image before a series of elections starting next year 
also today authorities announced more than 50 more arrests as 
party of a continuing crackdown on antigovernment activity 
some opposition and dissident groups charge the arrests are part 
of a scheme to suppress dissent as rohs democratic liberal party 
approaches its first local elections in 30 years 
after roh named him as prime minister ro jaibong immediately 
issued a statement calling for law and order and said the 
conservative government will make further talks with longtime rival 
north korea a priority 
the priorities will be on establishing social discipline as 
well as law and order progress in interkorea dialogue and 
multilateral diplomacy said ro a former presidential aide 
i am disappointed kim daejung head of the leading 
opposition party for peace and democracy said of the cabinet 
changes he said they made the government more conservative and 
rightist 
but the naming of a new prime minister and nine new cabinet 
ministers indicate little substantive changes in policy either 
domestic or foreign 
some appointments reflected emphasis on dialogue and exchanges 
with archrival north korea 
a government intelligence agency today announced the arrest of 
53 radicals on charges of infiltrating campuses and the military 
allegedly to foment violent revolution 
the arrests bring to 84 the number of people charged in the last 
two days with antigovernment activity the people were arrested in 
recent weeks and police and intelligence agencies said dozens more 
radicals are being sought 
the president is midway in a fiveyear term which ends in 1992 
he has made dramatic progress in foreign relations by expanding 
seouls ties with communist and former communist nations but 
support for domestic policies is at an all time low as he prepares 
for next years local elections 
no date has been set for the balloting but it is expected in 
the first half of the year 
three more national elections including those for parliament 
and a new president will be held in the next two years 
the largely ceremonial post of prime minister has become 
increasingly significant because it acts as chief delegate to 
highlevel talks on easing tensions with communist north korea 
a fourth round of talks is scheduled for february 
in another move seen to reflect changing relations with the 
north choi hojoong was moved from foreign minister to unification 
minister and will serve as deputy prime ministerr 
choi was instrumental in helping seoul forge dramatic new ties 
with former communist allies of north korea the government hopes 
its actions will force the north from its isolation and lead to 
eventual unification of the peninsula divided since 1945 
the new foreign minister is lee sangok a career diplomat 
currently posted in geneva with the rank of ambassador as chief of 
mission to international agencies 
the economic ministers were unchanged but lee bongsuh a us 
educated economist was named trade and industry minister the 
government hopes he will mend escalating trade frictions between 
seoul and washington 
roh has changed the 24member cabinet several times since he 
took office in february 1988

department store manager jon saucier says 
he transferred from new hampshire to maine so he could get away 
from having to open for business on sundays 
but a blue law that kept large stores in maine from opening on 
the sabbath passes into history this weekend for saucier it will 
be business as usual on sunday just like it is in every other 
state except north dakota 
saucier manager of service merchandise in augusta sees the 
sunday sales law approved by voters nov 6 as more of a convenience 
for consumers than a boon for business 
other retail officials agree but most knowing that their 
competitors will be open sunday will be ready too 
i think theyll wade into it said saucier i think itll 
be a gradual thing 
spokeswoman margaret mcewan of shaws supermarkets inc which 
operates 17 stores in maine said its almost like deja vu 
because no one knew what to expect when massachusetts lifted its 
sunday sales ban a few years back 
my expectation is that at first those who resisted maines 
change will not shop sundays but as time goes on that will 
change mcewan said 
sunday has become shaws third busiest day of the week in 
massachusetts rhode island and new hampshire she said 
robert reny sr president of renys department stores doubts 
consumers will buy more with an extra day to shop 
there are no more dollars in that pie reny said 
reny a leading opponent of the blue law change said 
competition and consumer demand are the only reasons he plans to 
open his 14 stores sunday 
the new law applies to stores with more than 5000 square feet 
of selling space 
the old law had a number of exemptions one let large stores 
open from noon to 5 pm on the four sundays before christmas 
another let the ll bean outdoor goods company in freeport stay 
open 365 days a year 
most maine stores took advantage of the prechristmas loophole 
but saw business drift to new hampshire when the holiday shopping 
season was over said marketing director marc letendre of the maine 
mall in south portland 
he predicted that the malls 140 stores will gain a significant 
amount of business from customers who used to shop out of state 
service merchandises saucier isnt so sure he said figures he 
gathered during his 12 years in new hampshire showed that maine 
stores did more business on saturdays while sundays were better 
for those in the granite state 
when the weekend was over we were even saucier said

a federal judge known for sending lawyers 
scurrying to dictionaries to understand his rulings has added more 
obscure vocabulary to the legal record including a reference to 
gladiators forced to fight blind 
on wednesday judge ferdinand fernandez of the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals delved into antiquity to compliment the losing 
side in a series of lawsuits over land in hawaii 
they have been effective gladiators and we do not by this 
decision convert them into andabatae he wrote 
an andabata according to the second unabridged edition of 
websters new international dictionary was a gladiator who fought 
blinded by a helmet 
fernandez added to his reputation by calling a motion in the 
case otiose or futile and saying it was pellucid or easy 
to understand that the state was immune from the lawsuit 
previously fernandez had pulled facinorous atrociously 
wicked and ensorcell bewitch from his bag of big words

christmastime minneapolis was minus 24 
thats cars not degrees 
police tallied 24 reports of cars stolen while the owners left 
them running so the engines could warm up 
one of them was jeffrey persons whose 1979 dodge colt was 
purloined on sunday when temperatures dipped to 20 below in the

a newspaper today quoted ministers as saying the 
government has decided to deploy a new generation of nuclear 
weapons to replace britains ageing freefall nuclear bombs 
the report in the independent said ministers had told the paper 
that despite the end of the cold war britain will go ahead with 
the deployment of tactical airtosurface missiles tasms to 
replace the freefall bomb system known as aw177 
the paper did not name the government ministers 
britain and france are the only two west european powers which 
maintain nuclear deterrent forces of their own independent of the 
nato defense alliance 
the independents report said the only question still open is 
over the type of tasm system to use and a decision is expected in 
the new year 
ministers are preparing a study of the options including two 
american systems and a possible anglofrench missile french 
scientists have been involved in top secret talks at the nuclear 
weapons establishment at aldermaston 45 miles west of london 
where the warheads would be designed and built 
britains decision yet to be announced could be conveyed to 
the nato planning group at its meeting in late march one 
ministerial source said we are definitely going ahead with the 
tasm the only question is what type 
the tasm project is in addition to the 9 billion trident 
nuclear missile system britain has ordered to replace its aging 
submarineborne polaris missiles 
the trident missiles bought from the united states but to be 
carried aboard submarines built in britain are due to become 
operational in the mid1990s 
the independent said the likely cost of the tasm program ranges 
from 187 million for a system brought from the united states to 
187 billion if britain decides to collaborate in a new 
anglofrench weapon 
the paper said the tasm program would be highly controversial 
that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has urged the united 
states not to sell any more nuclear technology to britain after 
delivery of the trident missiles 
if britain sought to purchase us tasms it would upset the 
soviets and could put back progress on confidencebuilding measures 
leading to other arms reductions but britain is bound to point out 
the number of warheads would be smaller than the bombs they 
replace the report said 
it said government ministers are satisfied that tasms are the 
only credible way britain can maintain the right mix of nuclear 
weapons in its arsenal

maintenance documents were falsified to keep the airlines planes 
flying eastern has denied the allegations 
miamibased eastern which has shriveled in size and lost 
millions of dollars has been operating under bankruptcy protection

his own rise to power

ravaged citrus fruit snapped water pipes and threatened lives but 
it still was unusually brisk for the rest of the united states 
a mass of warm air spread across parts of washington wyoming 
idaho california oregon arizona and nevada raising temperatures 
in some areas by as much as 40 degrees 
but the national weather service cautioned people not to get 
used to it forecasters say a new cold front as chilly as the last 
one will hit washington full force by this evening and move south 
reaching southern california by the weekend

kuwaits exiled foreign minister said today that 
he believes it is too late for peace initiatives and that war is 
thus inevitable in the persian gulf 
the whole world has given enough time for a peaceful 
settlement of the gulf crisis sheik sabah alahmed alsabah told 
a news conference 
he and kuwaits ousted emir sheik jaber alsabah arrived 
wednesday for a threeday visit 
chinese president yang shangkun told the emir on wednesday that 
before considering war the international community should first 
exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on iraq the official 
xinhua news agency said 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing wa asked at a news 
conference today what new sanctions china would suggest but was 
unable to name any 
he simply reiterated his governments position that 
unremitting efforts should be made for peace 
a militarily enforced un embargo imposed after president 
saddam hussein seied kuwait on aug 2 has halted virtually all 
trade with iraq which had been heavily dependent on imports but 
has failed to persuade saddam to back down 
saddam faces a unimposed deadline to withdraw by jan 15 or 
face possible attack 
the kuwaiti foreign minister said he had not heard of any 
chinese peace initiatives but he maintained that only military 
force would dislodge iraq from kuwait 
whether by the arab world whether by the friendly countries 
whether by the third world countries or by the big powers it is 
very late for such peace initiatives it would not be useful 
he said 
the foreign minister said yang told the emir china would 
continue to press for an unconditional iraqi withdrawal 
the kuwaiti foreign minister said the emir came to thank chinese 
officials for their support in international efforts to dislodge 
iraqi troops from kuwait he said kuwaiti leaders appreciate 
chinas position on the gulf crisis even though it refused to back 
the united nations authorization of the use of force to dislodge 
iraq from kuwait 
china abstained in the vote on the un security council 
resolution last month but supported all previous un measures 
seeking to pressure saddam into withdrawal 
the kuwaiti emir ends his threeday china visit on friday and 
will return to exile in taif saudi arabia kuwaiti officials said

who wants to buy a bunch of belgian 
stretcars that have been around for 25 to 30 years 
at least three major european cities 
the prospect was problematic for belgian foreign trade 
officials 
seems the streetcars are practically indestructible the foreign 
cities that buy them bucharest the hague and marseille are 
interested will be lost markets for new belgian streetcars 
on the other hand theres pride at stake 
the societe des transports intercommunaux de bruxelles 
stib which owns the cars recalls that it sold some of its old 
streetcars to cairo which later resold them to copenhagen 
and 40yearold belgian trolleys are still running in the 
streets of asuncion paraguay 
the cars owner said wednesday that it has offers from those 
three major european cities for 92 old trolleys and would like to 
sell at least 50 at 50000 apiece 
that will make for more room in jammed depots for one the 
company has 48 new trolleys on order from belgian firms of 
course for 100 million 
stib says bucharest wants to reuse the old streetcars marseille 
is mainly interested in their bogies the same as those on its own 
cars and the hague wants them for spare parts 
the company gave up the idea of modernizing the old cars that 
would cost more than new streetcars

helicopter gunships killed 10 tamil 
rebels who attempted a suicide attack on an army camp in tractors 
loaded with explosives government officials said today 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne said wednesdays 
operation was the third suicide attempt on the elephant pass camp 
in the past week wijeratne who is in charge of the government 
campaign against the tamil tiger rebels said that in each case the 
attack was foiled by helicopter gunships 
troops in helicopter gunships wednesday killed a large number 
of rebels when they destroyed some vehicles loaded with explosives 
and being driven into the elephant pass camp wijeratne said at 
the weekly cabinet briefing 
he did not give details of the previous attempts 
military officials said 10 tigers were killed in the attack 
wednesday they said the helicopters fired on the tigers while they 
were driving four tractors and a jeep into the elephant pass camp 
the camp 180 miles northeast of colombo guards one of the main 
entrances to the tigercontrolled jaffna peninsula 
there was no confirmation of the report from the remote area or

liberation tigers of tamil eelam said in a christmas day telephone 
interview the tigers would offer a unilateral ceasefire starting 
dec 31 and lasting two or three days 
the latest battles between the government and the tigers started 
six months ago when the rebels broke a 13monthold ceasefire 
overran police stations and massacred hundreds of police officers 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
have long complained of discrimination by sinhalese in jobs the 
economy and use of the sinhala language

the nations capital faces a financial crisis 
rivalling that of new york city when it tottered near bankruptcy in 
the 1970s a financial adviser to mayorelect sharon pratt dixon 
says 
franklin d raines chairman of dixons transition financial 
management committee says washingtons deficit for this fiscal 
year could reach 300 million 100 million more than the 
administration of outgoing mayor marion barry estimated 
in five or six months the district will run out of cash and be 
unable to meet payrolls or pay its bills unless drastic actions are 
taken immediately raines wrote in a dec 21 memo obtained by the 
washington post 
aides to mayor marion barry and an advisory commission made up 
of business and civic leaders projected a 200 million deficit but 
raines said it would be between 275 million and 300 million by 
sept 30 the end of the fiscal year 
the difference will come from additional unbudgeted spending 
and a further deterioration of tax revenues due to the recession 
wrote raines a partner in the investment finance firm lazard 
freres 
raines who has also advised the cities of chicago and 
cleveland wrote in my 11 years of working with governments in 
financial difficulty i do not believe i have ever encountered a 
situation as potentially disastrous as this one 
the nations capital is at serious risk its problems are as 
big as those that faced new york city in the 1970s but despite the 
lessons of new york and other big cities which experienced 
financial crisis all the major actors in washington have avoided 
their responsibility for many years 
dixon said saturday that she was familiar with a tendency 
politicians have to feign surprise at problems they face after 
taking office in an effort to buy more time to effect change 
i know that approach she said i thought about using it 
myself i dont have to use any props good ol marion he left me 
with something thats for real

the city council under orders to change how 
members are elected in order to better represent minorities has 
decided to back a plan that would expand the council and draw new 
districts 
the 11member council agreed wednesday to request a november 
1991 election under a plan that voters approved in august 1989 the 
plan was forced by a settlement in a 1988 federal lawsuit that said 
the election system made it difficult for minorities to be elected 
the move comes after voters earlier this month defeated a 
government overhaul that called for the election of 14 council 
members by districts and the mayor by the city as a whole 
under the current system instituted in 1975 eight members are 
elected from districts and three others including the mayor are 
elected from the city at large 
supporters said the plan would have helped ease racial 
inequities that make it difficult for minorities to get elected 
opponents said the system would have resegregated dallas they 
backed a plan calling for 10 candidates to be elected by district 
four by larger districts or regions and the mayor by the city as 
a whole 
on wednesday a majority of council members agreed to request 
the november 1991 election following the opponents plan with 
districts to be drawn later using new census figures 
using 1980 census figures the council was unable to draw city 
council district lines that a majority of the members would 
support 
consequently the council decided against submitting a specific 
plan to the us justice department or to us district judge jerry 
buchmeyer of dallas in whose court a voting rights lawsuit against 
dallas was filed in 1988 
the action increases the likelihood that a federal judge will 
decide on his own a new system of government upon dallas 
the referendum earlier this month was part of the settlement of 
the 1988 lawsuit brought by roy williams and marvin crenshaw 
blacks who failed in their atlarge council bids they charged that 
the election system made it difficult for minorities to win office 
black and hispanic leaders nationwide have long charged that 
atlarge elections dilute minority voting strength

processed in jacksonville and then taken to camp lejeune nc for 
possible courtmartial for their 29day deserter status 
maj bill grein a marine spokesman in new orleans said the two 
will probably be held in the brig until they can speak with their 
commanding officer 
their lawyer ellis rubin of miami said there was a federal 
warrant for their arrest so he advised them to turn themselves in 
the military could either discharge the pair hold a hearing on 
their conscientiousobjector status or order them courtmartialed 
on the desertion charges rubin said the charges also could be 
reduced to unauthorized absence 
marines can face up to one year in the brig for unauthorized 
absence and one year for missing the unit which left town nov 27 
the army had 77 conscientious objector applications through 
november this year said pentagon spokesman maj doug hart last 
year there were 74 applications and 22 soldiers were discharged 
basic warrior training exposed me to darkness death killing 
and war says perez in his application for conscientiousobjector 
status this is when i realized that my conscience would not 
allow me to participate in any war

jordan has increased its security forces 
along the ceasefire line with israel as a precaution against any 
surprise attack by the jewish state military sources said today 
we cant afford to be taken by surprise by the israelis and 
the beefup is a precautionary measure in response to a massive 
military deployment by the israelis on the other side of the 
demarcation line one source said referring to the border set up 
after the 1967 middle east war 
information minister ibrahim izzeddine declined comment on the 
reported buildup 
israels 141000strong armed forces have been on alert since 
kuwait was invaded aug 2 by iraq iraqi president saddam hussein 
has repeatedly threatened to attack israel if the usled 
multinational force launches a military strike on baghdad israel 
has warned saddam it would retaliate if he carries through with his 
threat 
the jordanian military source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said we have no intention of launching any military 
strike against anyone but we have to be on alert to protect our 
national security 
he declined to give any figures of military strength along the 
western border jordan has a 100000man army including 
conscripts and 40000strong militia known as the popular army 
a visitor to the jordan valley 15 miles west of amman reported 
seeing a heavy buildup of tanks artillery and soldiers in recent 
days 
us officials said on wednesday they believe saddam will attack 
israel if he believes that a gulf conflict is inevitable by 
hitting the jewish state the arabs main enemy the iraqi leader 
would hope to split the arab states aligned with the united states 
from the coalition 
senior israeli legislator eliahu benelissar declared on 
wednesday that jordan was included in the israeli warnings to 
retaliate because it is in such close alliance with iraq and 
because of its location 
benelissar said saddams missiles and combat jets cannot do 
much against israel without jordan

a box containing 143 pounds of uncut 
cocaine washed ashore just two blocks from the state police 
training academy 
the cocaine is worth at least 18 million and would be worth 
even more after being cut or diluted with other substances for 
street sale said first assistant monmouth county prosecutor alton 
kenney 
a federal drug agent said its not uncommon for illegal drug 
shipments to wash ashore like the cocaine found last week 
one of the things smugglers are starting to do is tow the 
stuff theyll hook a tow line on it fix it so it goes under the 
water said donald ashton agentincharge of the newark office 
of the drug enforcement administration 
occasionally the tow lines will break or if a coast guard 
cutter was approaching theyd cut the line

in a ruling published today the 
supreme court conditionally approved returning to the philippines 
350 million sent to switzerland by late president ferdinand e 
marcos 
the court said the money frozen in several swiss banks since 
march 1986 must be returned as soon as a criminal court in the 
philippines issued a legally binding verdict in the case that 
verdict it said should indicate whether the funds would be 
confiscated or returned to claimants 
it gave the philippines a year to open the criminal proceedings 
if no verdict were returned within the deadline swiss banks would 
end their seizure of the assets upon request of those affected 
the court said 
it said the philippine trial must conform to the standards set 
in the swiss federal constitution and the european human rights 
convention covering chiefly the independence of the judiciary and 
the impartiality of judges 
before returning the funds swiss authorities must determine 
that all conditions have been met the court said 
bank records seized in zurich and bern however can be turned 
over to philippine authorities under the ruling dated dec 21 
marcos his family and aides have been accused by the philiipine 
government led by president corazon aquino of looting the treasury 
marcos was forced out of office in a 1986 people power 
revolution 
zurich district attorney dieter jann said the courts warning 
about failure to meet the dec 21 1991 deadline did not mean the 
assets would automatically revert to the marcos family he said the 
family would probably have to prove its claim to the money in 
protracted civil law proceedings 
jann said the deadline was relatively short he said it 
seemed to make plain the swiss desire that the philippines take 
concrete action at last in preparing a criminal trial in the 
case 
the ruling rejected 11 appeals against lower court decisions to 
release funds totaling 350 million that are now blocked at credit 
suisse in zurich and at swiss bank corporation in fribourg 
the appeals were filed by lawyers on behalf of marcos widow 
imelda and other family members as well as of three foundations 
based in the principality of liechtenstein 
the decision ended more than four years of litigation in swiss 
courts 
following marcos flight to the united states all swiss assets 
linked to marcos and his family were provisionally frozen march 24 
1986 under an unprecedented government decree 
the freeze was extended indefinitely after the philippine 
government requested swiss judicial assistance in efforts to 
recover the money originally estimated to total about 1 billion 
marcos lawyers frequently cited the absence of formal criminal 
charges as a reason why the request for judicial assistance should 
be turned down but in a july 1 1987 ruling the supreme court 
authorized such assistance

russias finance minister has resigned saying the 
largest and richest soviet republic has made no progress in the 
transition to a market economy the russian legislatures newspaper 
reported today 
boris fyodorov 33 was quoted as telling rossiiskaya gazeta 
that lawmakers in the russian republic have been unwilling to take 
responsibility for necessary but unpopular measures such as 
lifting artificial price controls 
regrettably there is nothing like progress toward the 
market he was quoted as saying 
fyodorov told the newspaper important decisions such as forming 
private companies setting up a stock market and bringing russian 
accounting practices in line with international norms get bogged 
down in the depths of the apparatus for months on end 
cabinet ministers seem to believe in all seriousness that they 
can run the economy as they would run a factory he was quoted as 
saying populist measures involving ever new outlays are taken 
one after another while the revenue base is being curtailed 
this is a shortcut to financial bankruptcy for the republic 
and for the soviet union as a whole he reportedly said 
on nov 1 the russian federation began a program to switch from 
a centrally planned command economy to a free market within 500 
days russian lawmakers said they wanted to move faster than the 
national government but their policies often conflict and create 
confusion rather than reform

trading on the new york and american stock 
exchanges was delayed 90 minutes today after a fire broke out in 
the wall streetarea building that houses their computer 
operations 
the exchanges opened at 11 am because of the fire which 
followed a transformer explosion 
the securities and exchange commission asked all other exchanges 
to refrain from trading until the information system was up and 
operational spokeswoman mary mccue said 
its only fair that market participants have access to the 
same information she said 
the overthecounter market began trading at 930 am 
regional exchanges which include the midwest pacific 
cincinnati boston and philadelphia exchanges trade some of same 
stocks as the new york and american exchanges but handle only a 
small percentage of the total volume of stock traded on the major 
exchanges 
the blaze erupted at the building that houses the securities 
industry automation corp which controls the computer system for 
stock trading said new york stock exchange spokeswoman sharon 
gamsin the stock exchanges are located several blocks away 
the company a joint venture between the two major stock 
exchanges was evacuated about 230 am about two hours after the 
explosion she said 
officials said earlier that the fire may have caused hazardous 
pcbs to spew onto seven floors of the building 
the environmental protection agency gave securities industry 
automation permission to reenter the building at midmorning 
overthecounter stock trading is conducted independently of the 
new york and american exchanges the national association of 
securities dealers automated quotation system or nasdaq reports 
quotes for overthecounter stocks 
trading is usually light in the week between christmas and new 
years 
twentysix firefighters and 14 others were treated for possible 
exposure to carcinogenic polychlorinated biphenyls as a result of 
the fire said lt jim powell a new york city fire department 
spokesman 
of the 26 firefighters treated for possible pcb contamination 
four were hospitalized powell said 
it was not immediately known if any securities industry 
automation employees were among the injured 
the transformer exploded just after 1230 am powell said the 
fire was under control at 316 am 
trading disruptions are relatively rate more than a year ago 
trading on the new york stock exchange was halted when a 
firerelated power problem at securities industry automation 
briefly delayed the opening one day 
last month a power failure disrupted trading for 90 minutes 
the exchange shut down after trading began nov 23 and resumed 
later that morning 
in midaugust a fire at a con edison power substation forced the 
american stock exchange new york mercantile exchange and other 
futures markets in lower manhattan to close by early afternoon the 
new york stock exchange was unaffected by the outage but trading 
volume slowed

when hunters legally killed 569 potentially 
diseased bison outside yellowstone national park two winters ago 
citics complained that they wounded montanas proud reputation as 
a refuge for wildlife 
now officials are thinking of modifying the hunt to make it 
clear that the purpose is to keep montana cattle herds 
diseasefree but conservation and animalrights groups still 
arent satisfied 
montanas department of fish wildlife and parks is considering 
a change in rules that now call for state game wardens and national 
park rangers to join private hunters in killing adult bison that 
cross from yellowstone into montana in search of winter forage 
the department plans to make its decision on friday after 
todays hearing 
i think the plan we have now is a good plan and will work 
gov stan stephens said in a recent interview 
but the new yorkbased fund for animals has sued to stop all 
bison killing the greater yellowstone coalition an environmental 
group says the state should consider nonlethal alternatives 
the montana board of livestock frustrated with the long debate 
has asked the us department of agriculture to quarantine 
yellowstone 
about half of the 2500 to 3000 bison in the 2millionacre 
park are believed to carry brucellosis a disease that causes 
cattle to abort montana spent millions of dollars over a decade to 
eradicate brucellosis in its cattle 
why should we have one vestige of infection left asked 
james glossen of usdas animal and plant health inspection service 
from an agricultural perspective we dont want that reservoir of 
infection in yellowstone 
under the current plan negotiated with the national park 
service private hunters are called to kill bull bison and game 
wardens and park rangers may be called in to kill cows that wander 
out of the park sometimes onto private land calves would be 
captured neutered and sold 
bison that remain inside yellowstone may not be harmed 
officials say the plan seeks to spread the responsibility for 
the killings and mitigate some of the outrage that followed the 
killing of 569 bison by private hunters during the winter of 
198889 eleven have been killed so far this season 
officials also say cows are more likely to carry brucellosis 
than bulls and putting the responsibility for their killing in the 
hands of wardens and rangers should reduce the chances of their 
spreading disease 
but the montana wildlife federation a conservation group whose 
ranks include hunters says the bison killing is damaging the 
montana record as a progressive wildlife conservation state 
the eyes of all america are watching wayne pacelle fund 
for animals executive director said last week the park service 
clearly is not going to benefit by having the public see its 
rangers shoot its very symbol

at odds with national plans 
gorbachev speaking to the national parliament said russian 
lawmakers agreed to provide only 234 billion rubles toward the 
national budget for next year 119 billion rubles less than the 
republics contribution this year 
if other republics follow russias lead and cut their 
contributions to the 250 billion ruble national budget he said 
the result would be a collapse not only of the economy but of 
the union 
what are we supposed to do disband our military entirely and 
stop all fundamental scientific research thats not serious 
gorbachev said 
the soviet president urged the russian parliament to suspend its 
decision 
he also asked the congress of peoples deputies national 
legislature to pass a resolution calling for actions to resolve the 
budget dispute including creation of a national economic 
stabilization fund 
the congress was expected to vote on the resolution later today 
or early friday its session was originally scheduled to end today 
but was extended by one day because of the vice presidential 
voting which gorbachevs nominee gennady i yanayev won on the 
second ballto 
the soviet union is passing through turbulent times of bare 
grocery store shelves ethnic violence and nationwide political 
paralysis the national government has been at odds with russia 
over how to proceed with the economy 
the russian legislatures newspaper reported today that the 
republics finance minister has resigned saying the federation had 
made no progress in the transition to a market economy

a centrally planned command economy to a free market within 500 
days russian lawmakers said they wanted to move faster than the 
national government but their policies often conflict and create 
confusion rather than reform

a federal judge today ruled indianas new 
law regulating outofstate trash are unconstitutional saying the 
flow of rubbish into the state is all part of commerce 
us district judge john d tinder concluded that the laws 
three key provisions violate the constitutions commerce clause 
that allows free trade among the states 
however noble and popular these three provisions of house 
enrolled act 1240 appear to be they must give way to the 
constitutional principles tinder wrote 
the same protection that the commerce clause gives to the 
citizens of other states who feel the need to import waste into 
indiana protects indiana citizens when they export hazardous waste 
to other states 
commerce even in such bads as waste is a twoway street 
tinders ruling comes five months after the conclusion of a 
trial on a lawsuit filed by two pennsylvania trash haulers who 
challenged the law shortly after it was signed last spring by gov 
evan bayh 
bayh vacationing in south carolina was preparing a statement 
in reaction to the ruling his office said 
attorney general linley e pearson whose office handled the 
legal defense of the new law said he knew it would be difficult 
for the state to overcome the commerce clause argument about a 
halfdozen other states have had similar trash laws struck down on 
the same ground he said 
ive always maintained it would be an uphill battle said 
pearson 
the provisions struck down today required a trash hauler to 
certify where the largest part of the waste in a shipment was 
generated and required a hauler to receive a health officers 
certification that the shipment contained no hazardous or 
infectious waste the third provision imposed a dumping fee equal 
to the fee charged at the landfill closest to the point of origin 
of the trash shipment 
the law was passed with bipartisan support after bayh and 
legislators expressed alarm that indiana had become a dumping 
ground for trash from eastern states 
tinder said his ruling doesnt prevent indiana from regulating 
outofstate trash but the law requires that refuse should be 
treated the same as instate waste not in a tougher fashion 
those efforts could include imposing and enforcing stringent 
regulations on infectious or hazardous waste tinder wrote 
the judge also noted that his ruling doesnt disturb other 
provisions of the law that require solidwaste management plans 
within indiana impose a tipping fee on all waste deposited within 
the state and require haulers of waste within indiana to certify 
the county of origin of the trash shipment

lance cpl john scott is a marine 
grunt training for the dangerous job of breaching iraqi defenses 
he is also kashim ishmael elijah scott a follower of islam who 
feels he has a special purpose defending the birthplace of the 
religion despite differences with his hosts and the us military 
over his faith 
i feel like i have more of a purpose than the average marine 
most people here are wondering why they are trying to grasp a 
reason i feel i am defending mecca and medina which is sacred 
ground scott said 
the 20yearold from los angeles is a member of the alpha 
company in the 1st battalion third marine regiment which was 
deployed in september 
when he got to saudi arabia he reaffirmed his islamic faith in a 
saudi mosque just to feel that i did it in the homeland 
lance cpl d carlos timmons 21 of atlanta georgia decided 
to convert to islam while in saudi arabia 
not many brothers can say i made shahada in saudi arabia 
he said making shahada which means witness in arabic is one of 
the five main tenets of the faith 
an adherent must say i witness that there is no god but god 
and mohammed is his prophet in the presence of a learned prayer 
leader 
he also must accept the other four principles praying five 
times a day fasting during the holy month of ramadan donating 
money for the poor annually and making a pilgrimage to the holy 
cities of mecca and medina where mohammed founded the faith at 
least once in his lifetime 
members of the predominately black islamic sect in the united 
states are sometimes called black muslims 
in the united states charismatic black muslim leaders like the 
late malcolm x used islam to stress black nationalism some have 
called for creating a separate black nation in the united states 
that would be loosely based on islam 
the saudis stress we have to come back to the principles that 
us muslims have strayed from the faith its books the oneness of 
god scott said 
they said we were getting too much into the social aspect of 
things and not praising god enough that was the only derogatory 
thing we heard from them he added 
for their part the saudis have been trying to counteract the 
negative image islam has in the united states due to a decade of 
confrontation with some of its more extremist elements especially 
shiite moslem kidnappers in lebanon and others fueled by the 
revolutionary zeal of the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
islam was introduced in the picture of khomeini of terrorists 
and so forth this is not islamic said mohammed alokat a saudi 
who organizes lectures for the troops on saudi culture 
here the holy book the koran is considered the constitution 
followers of islam recognize jesus as a prophet but reject that 
he is the son of god and dont accept christmas as a holiday 
such honoring is only for god not for any human being said 
dr mohammed aldabbal director for literary criticism at imam 
mohammed ibn saud islamic university of riyadh in an interview 
scott and timmons said they do not celebrate christmas other 
tenets of the faith they do not follow strictly but they pointed 
out that mohammed himself allowed soldiers fighting a war some 
leeway they only pray three times a day for example 
we do too much to pray five times said timmons 
they want recognition from the us military in the form of 
enlisted prayer leaders and time out for prayers on friday 
there is no firm statistic on how many of the 300000 us 
troops here have converted but christian chaplains said they have 
heard of dozens it is not clear how many were black muslims 
the office of the senior defense department chaplain in 
washington said there are about 2700 followers of islam in all 
us military services but no prayer leaders 
it stressed in a statement that the us military respects the 
right of all armed forces members to practice any religion as 
guaranteed in the constitution

the callup of reservists for the persian 
gulf buildup is striking medical care hard in rural america 
leaving some small towns without doctors and forcing retired 
physicians back to work 
dr victor hoefner jr 70 was enjoying his retirement last 
month when his son dr victor c hoefner iii an army national 
guardsman was called up for duty the persian gulf 
now the elder hoefner has taken over his sons family practice 
in this western colorado community 
the pentagon wont say how many doctors have been called up 
citing security in addition to the activation of members of the 
army navy and air force reserves the army has begun forcing some 
retired medical officers back into uniform 
the effect of the callup is quickly felt in small towns and the 
indefinite duration of the crisis is adding to the problem 
according to rural health experts 
are we talking three months six months or a year asked 
toby turner spokeswoman for the national rural health association 
in kansas city 
rural health has been in crisis anyway and losing 50 percent 
of your small hospitals staff at one time is just too much of a 
blow the military is just filling slots in these units without 
paying any attention to a medical reservists role at home 
the pattern were seeing is that when people are called from a 
small community its felt much more because the likelihood of a 
critical position being affected is greater and the likelihood of 
having adequate backup is less than a large hospital said al 
chechik spokesman for the wisconsin hospital association 
the callup of physicians nurses and technicians has the 
potential to strip the us public health service staffs on indian 
reservations although not too many have been called as yet 
officials said 
the public health service hospital in crownpoint nm serving 
navajos and other tribes in the area lost its only ear nose and 
throat specialist 
the public health service is part of the armed services and 
we sign a statement that we can be pulled for noncombatant duty 
said dr annie kusava a pediatrician in crownpoint who carries 
the rank of lieutenant colonel 
in verdigre neb the lone physician was called up leaving the 
northeast nebraska community of 617 without a doctor 
dr ken pavlik an army reservist leaves a medical clinic and 
patients in the knox county hospital and nursing home 
he arranged for dr dj nagengast who lives 25 miles away in 
bloomfield to make rounds and check on his patients 
there is no question that this is going to be an inconvenience 
to a lot of people pavlik said 
while the number of physicians pulled out of rural areas 
apparently isnt great their departure leaves a far larger gap 
than would that of their bigcity counterpart 
it hurts the rural hospitals where there have been shortages 
anyway said pete moberg spokesman for st marys hospital in 
grand junction 
st marys is a regional hospital with accident victims or 
emergency surgery patients transferred from lesserequipped rural 
hospitals 
if a little hospital loses its doctor and a scrub nurse 
theres going to be no surgery done there at all moberg said 
st marys is receiving more patient referrals from doctors and 
other hospitals in the western slope region because of the callup 
moberg said 
dr jose luis rodriguez the only plastic surgeon in glenwood 
springs 90 miles east of grand junction closed his office and 
referred patients to doctors in grand junction after he was 
activated he is a lieutenant colonel in the national guard 
in wyoming even more sparsely populated than colorado there 
are only about 600 doctors in the entire state and seven are 
already gone or on standby 
in a state like wyoming the impact of losing physicians is 
great said rich johnson executive director of the wyoming 
medical society there are not a lot of choices in medical care 
in many communities

iran is neutral in the persian gulf crisis 
but whatever the outcome it will have an impact on irans future in 
the region and beyond 
the crisis also will have a profound effect on president hashemi 
rafsanjanis efforts to steer iran away from the legacy of the late 
revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
iraq was irans foe in the 198088 persian gulf war if iraq 
emerges from the current crisis with its military power intact 
iran would be wooed by the countries of the region as a 
counterweight to saddam husseins ambitions 
if iraq is driven out of kuwait and its military might destroyed 
or seriously weakened iran would be left in a powerful position 
that would make its arab neighbors uneasy 
a victory for america and the international force and any 
continuation of a us presence in the region might incense irans 
antiwestern radicals and create the possibility of new turbulence 
in the region 
rafsanjani leader of the countrys socalled pragmatists has 
largely pushed aside radical rivals in a political power struggle 
that surfaced following khomeinis death in june 1989 
but the hardliners opposed to his drive to repair relations 
with the west and irans arab neighbors are seeking to undercut 
rafsanjani by whipping up antiamerican passions 
some even want to align iran with iraq in a new islamic front 
against the great satan 
the iranians are faced with a dilemma they dont want the 
iraqis to further tip the regional balance by coming out of this 
situation in possession of parts of kuwait said philip robins 
an analyst with londons royal institute of international studies 
on the other hand they are concerned about the buildup of 
western forces particularly the americans in the region he 
noted in a telephone interview 
shireen hunter an analyst with washingtons institute of 
strategic and international studies fears that war could set 
back the process of moderation consolidation and reconstruction 
going on in iran now 
if war erupts and if it extends into iraqi territory the 
radicals are going to try to use the opportunity to undermine 
rafsanjanis moderate policies she said in a telephone interview 
with the associated press 
a solution where iraq is not destroyed but is left weakened is 
in irans best interests hunter noted 
parliament speaker mehdi karrubi who has emerged as the 
foremost leader of the radicals said i would not support a 
confrontation with the united states handinhand with iraq 
but if it was a panislamic thing together with all the other 
moslem countries id support that he said in an interview 
the radical position is that if possible the way should be 
paved for the humiliation of american forces in the persian gulf 
said morteza firozi a senior commentator on the influential 
englishlanguage tehran times daily 
irans 55 million people are persians not arabs but they are 
overwhelmingly shiite moslems and despite the persian gulf war

population 
hunter said that if the shiites holiest shrines in the iraqi 
cities of najaf karbala and kazimain all south of baghdad are 
damaged in any hostilities popular passions in iran would really 
rise 
iran has insisted iraq withdraw from kuwait but rafsanjani also 
has condemned the foreign forces sent to the persian gulf which 
iran considers its turf 
the kuwait crisis has brought considerable gains for rafsanjani 
including as much as 4 billion in oil price increases that boost 
his drive to rebuild the economy the crisis has also led to 
improved relations with the west and the other arab states and 
iraqi acceptance of tehrans conditions for formally ending the 
198088 war 
robins noted it would be highly unlikely that iran will in 
any way become involved in a military conflict on either side 
deputy foreign minister ali mohammad besharati said in an 
interview if there is a war our policy is clear we do not 
intend to join any forces in the gulf or to help one side against 
another our policy is to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis

crop damage from the cold wave that gripped 
most of the nation before christmas was mostly confined to fruit 
and vegetables in california a government report said thursday 
the severe cold in california caused extensive damage to the 
citrus and vegetable crops the joint agricultural facility said 
but arizona and texas crops escaped serious freeze damage it 
added 
rain and snow over the eastern third of the nation provided 
moisture to growing crops and delayed late harvest of corn and 
soybeans the report said lack of moisture in florida resulted 
in continued use of irrigation in fruit groves 
the facility is operated by the agriculture and commerce 
departments weekly reports show the general effects of weather on 
crops but do not foretell actual losses or production estimates 
while the low temperatures in california damaged the citrus 
crop the report said damaged fruit can be processed but will be 
limited by processing capacity 
in southern texas growers in the rio grande valley reported 
little damage to growing crops from cold weather the report 
said however there was some minor damage to spinach and beet 
crops in the san antonio winter garden area 
the agriculture department has forecast 1991 consumer food 
prices will increase an average of 2 percent to 5 percent from this 
year retail food prices gained and estimated 6 percent this year 
ralph l parlett jr of the departments economic research 
service said it was too early to tell for certain what impact 
the western freeze last week will have 
but parlett said fruit and vegetable prices will go up a 
little more next year than has been forecast 
overall however parlett said he is sticking with the agencys 
forecast of a 2 percent to 5 percent food prices increase next 
year

iran is neutral in the persian gulf crisis 
but whatever the outcome it will have an impact on irans future in 
the region and beyond 
the crisis also will have a profound effect on president hashemi 
rafsanjanis efforts to steer iran away from the legacy of the late 
revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
iraq was irans foe in the 198088 persian gulf war if iraq 
emerges from the current crisis with its military power intact 
iran would be wooed by the countries of the region as a 
counterweight to saddam husseins ambitions 
if iraq is driven out of kuwait and its military might destroyed 
or seriously weakened iran would be left in a powerful position 
that would make its arab neighbors uneasy 
a victory for america and the international force and any 
continuation of a us presence in the region might incense irans 
antiwestern radicals and create the possibility of new turbulence 
in the region 
rafsanjani leader of the countrys socalled pragmatists has 
largely pushed aside radical rivals in a political power struggle 
that surfaced following khomeinis death in june 1989 
but the hardliners opposed to his drive to repair relations 
with the west and irans arab neighbors are seeking to undercut 
rafsanjani by whipping up antiamerican passions 
some even want to align iran with iraq in a new islamic front 
against the great satan 
the iranians are faced with a dilemma they dont want the 
iraqis to further tip the regional balance by coming out of this 
situation in possession of parts of kuwait said philip robins 
an analyst with londons royal institute of international studies 
on the other hand they are concerned about the buildup of 
western forces particularly the americans in the region he 
noted in a telephone interview 
shireen hunter an analyst with washingtons institute of 
strategic and international studies fears that war could set 
back the process of moderation consolidation and reconstruction 
going on in iran now 
if war erupts and if it extends into iraqi territory the 
radicals are going to try to use the opportunity to undermine 
rafsanjanis moderate policies she said in a telephone interview 
with the associated press 
a solution where iraq is not destroyed but is left weakened is 
in irans best interests hunter noted 
parliament speaker mehdi karrubi who has emerged as the 
foremost leader of the radicals said i would not support a 
confrontation with the united states handinhand with iraq 
but if it was a panislamic thing together with all the other 
moslem countries id support that he said in an interview 
the radical position is that if possible the way should be 
paved for the humiliation of american forces in the persian gulf 
said morteza firozi a senior commentator on the influential 
englishlanguage tehran times daily 
irans 55 million people are persians not arabs but they are 
overwhelmingly shiite moslems and despite the persian gulf war 
feel kinship with fellow shiites who make up 55 percent of iraqs 
population 
hunter said that if the shiites holiest shrines in the iraqi 
cities of najaf karbala and kazimain all south of baghdad are

orders to manufacturers for big ticket 
durable goods plummeted 105 percent in november the government 
said thursday the report likely signals more layoffs in the 
factory sector which lost 200000 jobs last month and more than 
800000 in the last two years 
the orders drop matched the post1958 record falloff for one 
month set in january of this year it reduced orders to a 
seasonallyadjusted 1159 billion the lowest level since may 
1988 the commerce department said 
on capitol hill the chairman of the joint economic committee 
rep lee hamilton dind predicted that nationwide unemployment 
could hit 8 percent in the current downturn the jobless rate rose 
to 59 percent last month 
we will in fact have a recession said hamilton in his 1991 
economic forecast he said it could prove moderate or severe 
depending on the outcome of the persian gulf crisis 
a settlement in the gulf could reduce inflation and encourage 
an early recovery hamilton said but if the crisis 
intensifies the downturn will be longer and deeper if war comes 
all bets are off 
orders for durable goods items expected to last three or more 
years had risen 36 percent in october but have been down in six 
of 11 months so far in 1990 
to me this is the last nail in the coffin for the recession 
said economist sung won sohn of norwest corp in minneapolis 
its such a whopping and acrosstheboard decline that it 
indicates we are in a deep recession 
i think employment will continue to take a pretty significant 
beating said sohn who is forecasting a loss of an additional 
75000 manufacturing jobs in december 
however some analysts saw a glimmer of hope amid the gloom 
they said pressure from overseas competitors has forced 
manufacturers to trim payrolls sooner than in previous recessions 
that could help avoid even bigger layoffs later they said 
we look for a bad employment number in december but to the 
extent that manufacturers have succeeded in keeping payrolls in 
line with what they feel will be the worstcase outlook for demand 
i am hopeful that the worst of the job loss may be behind rather 
than ahead of us said economist stephen s roach of morgan 
stanley amp co 
in november declines in new orders were widespread but deepest 
in the transportation and defense industries 
transportation orders fell 274 percent in november that 
included a drop of 388 percent in aircraft and parts more than 
offsetting octobers 204 percent increase boeing co earlier 
reported new orders of 52 billion down from 107 billion a 
month earlier automobile and parts orders also fell 
excluding the volatile transportation sector orders fell 35 
percent to their lowest levels in two years after edging down 02 
percent in october 
new orders for defense equipment dropped 245 percent orders 
excluding defense were down 96 percent 
nondefense capital goods a barometer of business investment 
in expansion and modernization fell 164 percent in november 
only orders for nonelectrical machinery which includes 
computers showed no decline they were unchanged from october to 
november 
electrical machinery orders fell 76 percent and primary metals 
orders which often decline when orders for autos decline dropped 
98 percent 
you are seeing cascading weakness spreading from industry to 
industry said economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch 
the backlog of unfilled orders a good indication of how busy 
factories will be in months ahead dropped 11 percent to 4975 
billion it was the largest onemonth decline since november 1985 
shipments dropped 36 percent to 1217 billion the lowest 
level since last january

coal is still king in west virginia 
but its a monarchy where more and more subjects are opting for a 
new realm 
a dip in the market in the mid1980s as well as the automation 
of the industry were among factors in a mass exodus in the 1980s 
according to us census bureau figures released wednesday west 
virginias population was 1801625 this year a 76 percent 
decline from the 1949644 counted in 1980 
west virginia lost a higher percentage of residents than any 
state no bordering state lost population and west virginia was one 
of only four states to lose people 
i think its a red flag in economic planning said john 
hurd president of the state chamber of commerce 
i think when people dont stay here or come here i think its 
pure and simple they cant make a living in west virginia hurd 
said theres just not enough job opportunities for them 
mark polen vice president of the west virginia coal 
association said there are 40000 fewer jobs in the states coal 
industry than in 1976 when the market for metallurgical coal still 
was booming 
in the mid1980s that market bottomed out and southern west 
virginia where metallurgical coal is the main product suffered 
despite unemployment as high as 40 percent in some counties in 
the states southern coal fields the industry is having a bumper 
year 
it will produce 152 million tons of coal this year with a work 
force of 24500 thats the best production since 1951 when 163 
million tons were mined said gary white president of the state 
coal association 
in 1980 the mines employed 43600 and each miner produced 1097 
tons todays moremechanized mines produce 236 tons of coal per 
miner white said 
unemployment isnt a statewide problem 
if were still losing population it means we have a labor 
surplus said ed merrifield director of the states office of 
labor and economic research eventually youll reach a point 
where supply equals demand 
in 1979 658600 people were working in west virginia this 
year there are 625000 merrifield said 
manufacturing has declined from 117200 in 1979 to 87600 
employment in the glass industry dropped from 16500 to 7500 
metals employment slipped from 24800 to 14400 and chemical work 
dropped from 25800 to 17500 
gov gaston caperton believes the economy has turned the corner 
the decade of the 80s was a decade of despair for west 
virginia but the 90s will be a decade of growth said 
gubernatorial spokesman george manahan 
others however are concerned the states population is 
gradually aging 
in 197980 387786 children were in west virginia schools that 
number had fallen by 64000 this year department of education 
officials said 
the loss of population has been a constant bleed for three 
decades now said troy stewart political science professor at 
marshall university 
you have fewer people consuming fewer items and fewer people 
left to pay the bills stewart said the tax structure must be 
shaped in a way to cover the services but ensure someone is left 
to pay the bills too 
capertons administration imposed recordhigh taxes of 457 
million in the past two years that included reimposition of the 
sales tax on food at 6 percent

the chairman of congress joint economic 
committee predicted thursday that unemployment during the current 
economic downturn could rise to nearly 8 percent 
rep lee hamilton dind in an economic forecast for 1991 
said he based the estimate on jobless increases during recessions 
since world war ii 
the rate in such periods has increased by at least two 
percentage points he said in november the rate went up to 59 
percent 
hamilton who issued a written report and held a news 
conference said we will in fact have a recession next year 
but it will not be typical of past downturns 
this recession will be more unpredictable hamilton said 
because of record debt piled up during the expansion of the 1980s 
and the persian gulf crisis 
a settlement in the gulf could reduce inflation and encourage 
an early recovery hamilton said but if the crisis 
intensifies the downturn will be longer and deeper if war comes 
all bets are off 
hamilton emphasizing he spoke only for himself said last 
years deficit reduction agreement was a step in the right 
direction but did not finish the job he said a new agreement 
will be needed beyond 1991 
the key to longterm recovery is to increase national savings 
which would require an additional 80 billion of budget savings in 
fiscal 1995 hamilton said 
to ease suffering during the current downturn hamilton proposed 
reinstating the extended benefits program for those out of work for 
longer than six months 
the program virtually eliminated should be renewed because 
many jobless workers could exhaust their benefits hamilton 
said the proportion of the unemployed who receive jobless benefits 
has dropped from about 50 percent 10 years ago to about 33 percent 
today 
hamilton said the best way to shorten the downturn is by 
lowering interest rates to encourage construction and investment 
noting the federal reserve already has eased credit the 
chairman pointed out that the fed does not control the longterm 
rates that influence investment

federal marshals say they have spent more than 
360000 on security and transportation for manuel noriega since 
the deposed dictator was escorted out of panama after the us 
invasion 
the marshals service has cited the extraordinary costs of 
security details each time noriega has been shuttled from and to 
his private prison suite for court appearances 24 miles away 
the information was obtained by the miami herald on a freedom of 
information act request and published thursday 
noriega is awaiting trial on charges of accepting 46 million 
from the medellin cocaine cartel to protect usbound drug 
shipments 
the security bill through november totaled 363694 including 
everything from decoy vehicles to overtime for noriegas flight 
aboard a c130 cargo plane from panama to homestead air force base 
south of miami 
its not cheap but its not unique said marshals service 
spokesman steve boyle in washington in situations where theres 
high potential for media interest or security concerns the costs 
are quite extraordinary 
noriega has appeared in court five times since jan 3 when he 
surrendered to face drug indictments in miami and tampa 
boyle refuses to say how much each courthouse trip costs because 
we dont want to give anyone the basis to calculate the level of 
security he gets 
he notes that marshals have handled other costly inmates such 
as colombian cocaine kingpin carlos lehder rivas the 
transportation bill for the medellin cartel smuggler exceeded 1 
million before we were finished with his 7month trial in 
jacksonville 
federal expenses for noriegas quarters at the metropolitan 
correctional center southwest of miami already have raised some 
eyebrows 
his custombuilt cell features an exercise bicycle telephone 
copying machine and computer equipment the government installed 
to guarantee his rights to physical exercise and attorney access 
without endangering his security

gov michael s dukakis signed a clean air bill 
thursday that goes beyond new federal requirements for auto 
emissions in limiting pollutants blamed for acid rain and the 
greenhouse effect 
the measure is based on californias tough new standards 
supporters said massachusetts is the first state in the nation to 
go along with californias tighter controls 
state rep david cohen who sponsored the bill said last weeks 
passage of the standards in massachusetts may encourage other 
states to follow 
there are many many states that are looking at doing what we 
did but they were afraid cohen said massachusetts was a 
trailblazer in this action 
we hope to create a domino effect said jenny carter of the 
massachusetts public interest research group 
massachusetts air quality failed to meet federal health 
standards on at least 40 days during the past three summers this 
law will help reverse that trend carter said 
new york also is considering the california standards said 
benjamin marvin of the new york state department of environmental 
conservation 
the massachusetts bill says the new standards will be phased in 
beginning in 1993 but in reality state officials reached a verbal 
agreement with automobile manufacturers to start the program with 
the 1995 model year 
carter said she expects most manufacturers will adapt to the new 
law by refining catalytic converters 
she estimated that the measure would cost consumers an extra 
170 when they buy a new car but tighter warranty standards 
included in the new law would help defray that onetime cost 
the plan calls on car makers to cut smogcausing hydrocarbon and 
nitrogen oxide emissions by 50 percent to 75 percent beyond what is 
required under the new federal clean air act averaged over their 
entire fleet 
dukakis said the federal government must do more to fight 
pollution and to save energy so that the united states becomes less 
dependent on foreign energy supplies 
theres one other way to clean the air and thats to make 
automobiles more efficient dukakis said 
an operator at general motors corp in detroit said company 
officials would not be available to comment because of the 
holidays and a recorded message at ford motor co said offices 
there are closed until jan 2 
dukakis also signed two other environmental bills one to 
protect endangered species and the second to make local 
conservation commission members frontline agents in monitoring 
wetlands protection laws 
the endangered species bill protects the habitat of threatened 
species from alteration it also establishes a process for listing 
species as endangered threatened or of special concern and 
prohibits the taking or selling of species that make the list 
the wetlands conservation measure gives local conservation 
commissioners the power to protect wetlands in 1988 the states 
supreme judicial court ruled that the conservation commission 
lacked authority to enforce the wetlands protection act

said they did not know the content of the message which came as 
the soviet union is embroiled in domestic political turmoil 
bushs comments on the persian gulf were the latest in a series 
of mixed signals about readiness for military action lt gen 
calvin ah waller a senior commander in saudi arabia told 
reporters last week that us forces would not be fully ready for 
offensive action until mid february 
defense secretary dick cheney who met with area commanders in 
the middle east concluded his visit by saying the situation is 
not improving with regard to iraqi occupation of kuwait and the 
days are drawing closer when we may be forced to resort to military 
force 
bush said that cheney and gen colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff made a report to him after their trip to the 
gulf that was quite different than most stories ive been reading 
in the last few days in newspapers 
at the same time bush did not directly deny reports from the 
new york times and other news organizations that cheney and bush 
had relayed the concerns of military officers about us troop 
readiness 
im not going to tell you what they said but im going to 
tell you dont believe these reports youre reading 
its under control ive got total confidence in the chairman 
of the joint chiefs and the secretary of defense and our commander 
out there to whom i talked over the holidays dont be misled by 
these rabbit trails running through the snow out there 
he challenged reporters to show me the quotes from cheney 
and powell and dismissed the stories as rumors of what somebody 
is alleged to have told me 
told the stories were in the newspapers he said that doesnt 
make it right 
bush also expressed seeming irritation with the public comments 
made in recent days on the subject 
i think it would be very useful if from the president and 
others there were fewer comments about readiness theres been 
enough said about readiness bush said 
the president addressed the subject twice during the day once 
in a hallway encounter with reporters and again before boarding his 
helicopter for a return trip to camp david 
bush a wellknown workaholic denied he had returned to the 
white house for the day because he was bored as an official had 
said 
do i look bored he said 
bush telephoned french president francois mitterrand and former 
british prime minister margaret thatcher on monday from camp david 
said spokesman doug davidson 
he told reporters today that while on vacation he was staying 
in very close touch with the developments in the gulf 
asked about prospects for the proposed meeting between baker and 
iraqs president saddam hussein he said theres nothing going 
on on that front 
the two countries have been unable to agree on a date for the 
meeting to discuss the gulf situation 
us officials say the iraqis insist on jan 12 while the 
administration wants the meeting no later than jan 3 contending 
that a later date would give saddam hussein time to stall on 
getting his troops out of kuwait by the deadline

president carlos menem weathered 
a month of criticism before reluctantly deciding hell turn over 
the keys to a controversial red ferrari once he gets out of 
office 
the luxury sports car reported to be worth 100000 became a 
political lemon for menem after it was first seen parked at his 
official residence nov 20 
menem an avid sportsman and amateur rally car driver at first 
was thrilled by the gift from the italian motorcycle company ducati 
meccanica but last week he grudgingly told the weekly newsmagazine 
gente 
as i am very respectful of laws im going to leave this car 
as property of the nation when my term ends in 1995 
argentine law stipulates that any gift over a certain value 
belongs to the presidency and must be handed over upon completion 
of office 
by menems own admission before the criticism he had no 
intention of turning over the keys its mine mine mine the 
60yearold president told a nationally broadcast interview show 
the car was a gift from ducati chief g franco castiglioni in 
an accompanying letter he said he felt honored by menems visit to 
rome during the soccer world cup matches last summer and bestowed 
the ferrari 348 tb on menem so you dont forget italy 
but questions kept popping up in newspaper columns magazine 
stories radio talk shows and cocktail conversations 
how could menem who is cracking down on tax evasion accept a 
personal gift that bypassed customs duties of 170000 and arrived 
apparently free of charge via the state airline 
what kind of example was menem who has denounced corruption 
among public officials setting by saying it was acceptable to 
accept a gift worth several times ones annual salary 
and what did it say about a president who urges his countrymen 
to tighten their belts amid a recession as severe as any this 
century but who doesnt appear willing to share their sacrifices 
what is at issue is his reputation for political shrewdness 
the englishlanguage buenos aires herald commented his mine 
mine mine attitude suggests a dangerous lack of restraint or 
willful greed or a childish streak or a tragic flaw of some kind 
in the gente interview menem called suggestions he should have 
immediately donated the car to charity stupid hypocrisy 
they ducati gave it to me why should people be 
scandalized he was quoted as saying 
argentine law stipulates that any gift over a certain value 
belongs to the presidency and must be handed over upon completion 
of office 
menem a touch grudgingly said he will do just that 
but meanwhile im going to use it myself he said

the organization of american states summoned 
member states to a special meeting friday to discuss a venezuelan 
request for prompt action to restore the constitutional government 
in suriname 
the president of the washingtonbased oass permanent council 
juan pablo lohle of argentina on thursday issued a formal 
communique calling the meeting at venezuelas request 
venezuelan ambassador guido grooscors said the christmas eve 
coup was a severe violation of the principles of the oas 
charter and should not be sanctioned 
grooscors called for the oas to convene in emergency session in 
washington but said the meeting may have to be delayed because many 
ambassadors are away for the holidays 
on wednesday the venezuelan foreign ministry said it would 
refuse to recognize surinames new military government and asked 
for a firm response to the bloodless coup that ousted president 
ramsewak shankar 
shankar had served two years of the term to which he was elected 
in november 1987 
shankar was ousted in an uprising led by acting army chief cmdr 
ivan graanoogst who has pledged to hold elections within 100 days 
and relinquish power 
the bush administration has condemned the takeover and has 
advised americans not to travel to the former dutch colony 
brazil which holds good trade relations with suriname and is 
reportedly its largest south american creditor thursday did not 
appear to consider any special action necessary 
a spokesman for the brazilian embassy in caracas said that 
brazil viewed the coup as an internal affair and said the 
position of brazil is not to intervene

a fourth grade class was studying electricity and 
the image of a lightning bolt was frozen on the tv screen then 
teacher rodelle tompkins touched the remote control and zapped the 
bolt to life and her science class was off on an energetic 
discussion 
it was just the sort of reaction educators hope videodisc 
textbooks will create especially in once unapproachable subjects 
such as science 
its more funner than reading a book said nathan young 
its easier theres no reading and writing said classmate 
martin maniha 
laser videodisc textbooks have been in use in an estimated 7000 
us schools but texas is the first state to allow districts to 
use textbook money to buy them 
the 12inch discs resembling the smaller compact disc used for 
music can show still and moving pictures on a television screen 
and without having to close window shades and turn out lights 
the discs also provide higher quality sound and image than 
videotape allow the use of freeze frame like the lightning bolt 
without loss of detail and can hold information equivalent to 
54000 photographic slides on each side 
mrs tompkins who says her former school district in the rio 
grande valley was lucky to get a book let alone videodiscs 
says the videodiscs provide more information by exciting a greater 
portion of the class 
and she says theyre better than movies 
when you turn off the lights to show a movie the bottom 3 
percent of the class goes to sleep and the top 5 percent have 
already seen it she said 
but a noisy minority of mrs tompkins pupils at lamkin 
elementary school prefer curling up with an oldfashioned book to 
watching their science project go by at mtv speed 
its better to learn when you read by yourself said colleen 
wade 
and brian bassi added i dont like it that much i think 
reading is better than just watching and listening 
reaching kids is an extra big problem in science teaching 
these days said phyllis marcuccio assistant executive director 
of the national science teachers association in washington 
the volume of scientific information is so much greater these 
days its hard to get across in books ms marcuccio said 
adding that videodiscs also allow children to see people working 
which could open up career dimensions for them 
the videodisc program windows on science produced by optical 
data corp of warren nj comes with a suggested script for 
teachers and workbooks for the students 
one laserdisc program costs about 1000 but thats considered 
comparable to textbooks for a class because of the amount of data 
each one provides and that it can be used over and over 
although optical datas windows on science program which 
teaches biology geology and elementary physics is the only 
approved electronic textbook in texas other programs in social 
studies and health are becoming popular said optical data 
spokeswoman pam herber 
those programs include a historythroughgeography program 
similar to national geographic television shows and a program 
partly produced by abc news on current events such as the middle 
east the 1988 presidential campaign and aids 
although some pupils may still prefer books educators say that 
teaching science electronically can increase the number of video 
generation children turned on by once unapproachable subjects 
just because he cant read doesnt mean he cant think mrs 
tompkins said

rescuers working thursday in a 
snowstorm and heavy winds off the finnish coast said they heard 
tapping inside a capsized barge a sign that some of the 10 men 
aboard may be alive 
rescuers worked into the night long after winter darkness fell 
over the baltic sea at midafternoon winds of 54 knots were 
expected to slow overnight but the water temperature was 36 
degrees

aboard the pusher section of the craft had drowned the barge was 
reported entirely submerged several yards below the surface of the 
sea 
janeric dahlberg of fg shipping the barge owner said divers 
who tapped on the hull heard answering taps from the men inside 
all believed to be finns 
finnish news media quoted captain lars boxstrom of the gulf of 
finland maritime rescue center as saying if there are people in 
the vessel it is completely possible they are still alive because 
inside the vessel there is an air pocket 
later officials said the barge drifted into shallower water and 
that part of it was 13 feet above the surface enabling rescuers to 
walk on the hull they speculated that the craft became stuck on 
the seabed

an acetylene torch if the water was not too rough 
news reports said oxygen was being pumped into the upturned 
barge

celebre after a car wash owner sued city hall to move it has a 
new owner 
mac mackintosh lost his fight in small claims court last week 
when he tried to get 3000 in back rent from the city of homer for 
a boulder left in his car wash parking lot 
but the saga of the unwanted rock had a happy ending wednesday 
when shawn kinney bought it for 1 and paid 125 to have it 
delivered by forklift as a christmas present for her husband mark 
hes one of those people who for years at birthdays and 
christmas says oh i dont need anything shawn kinney said 
then my son came home one afternoon and said i found out what 
dad wants he wants the rock at the car wash 
movers hoisted the boulder wednesday with a 26ton forklift used 
for unloading containers from ships even the forklift proved 
barely up to the task it took all afternoon to pry the rock from 
the soil and carry it 100 yards uphill to the kinneys house 
the boulder which weighs between 25 tons and 35 tons and is the 
size of small sports car became news after mackintosh sue the 
city last october he claimed the boulder was excavated during a 
city streetwidening project and left in the lot when the car wash 
had a different owner

efforts to expand his business

joke said the 45yearold entrepreneur it may seem like a 
joke to an outsider but its not a joke if youre stuck with a 
rock this size 
city manager ce swackhammer said the boulder wasnt the citys 
responsibility he said he spent several thousand dollars in 
employee time fighting mackintoshs lawsuit because he was 
concerned about a precedent putting the city in the bouldermoving 
business 
it would have been cheaper for me to have moved the rock 
swackhammer said but other people have rocks

president mikhail s gorbachev turned defeat into 
victory thursday by persuading lawmakers to approve his choice for 
the soviet unions first vice president a new post in a 
reorganized federal government 
the vote came on the last day of a stormy 10day session of the 
congress of peoples deputies it was representative of the entire 
legislative meeting during which gorbachev got much of what he 
wanted but not without a struggle 
the congress had endorsed gorbachevs draft of a treaty to hold 
together the crumbling union and approved his proposals for 
national referendums on whether to allow private ownership of land 
and whether to preserve the union it also accepted his plan to 
strengthen presidential power 
early thursday legislators handed gorbachev what appeared to be 
his biggest defeat rejecting his candidate for the vice presidency 
gennady i yanayev by 31 votes but gorbachev insisted on his 
choice requested a second vote and yanayev was approved 
yanayev a relatively obscure 53yearold communist bureaucrat 
said he saw the vote as a referendum on gorbachev 
the vote this afternoon relates not only to me but the 
policies of the president yanayev told reporters 
yanayev was the only candidate for vice president a post 
created as part of the reorganized federal government hierarchy 
that was adopted by legislators wednesday 
the vice president assists the chief executive and under a 
constitutional amendment replaces the president of the ussr 
in case of his absence and inability to carry out his duties 
legislators at first balked at giving the relatively unknown 
yanayev such a potentially powerful visible job some said they 
wanted a candidate who had more experience with the economy 
the first vote thursday by the countrys highest legislative 
body was 1089 for yanayev and 583 against he needed at least 
1120 votes a simple majority of the 2239 registered deputies 
but gorbachev stonefaced ignored calls from lawmakers to put 
forward a different candidate he said it was important the vice 
president be someone in whom he had complete confidence 
the fact that only 583 deputies or 25 percent of the congress 
voted against comrade yanayev persuades me to ask the congress to 
vote again he said 
radical economist oleg bogomolov a congress delegate said 
yanayev lost the first vote because the bureaucrat is a 
representative of the party leadership and central committee 
apparatus hes very obedient very conformist 
yuri golikh chairman of the law enforcement committee of the 
supreme soviet legislature said i think he didnt win because 
the deputies didnt have a feel for him as a leader 
he has not spoken on serious philosophical conceptual topics 
in either the congress or the supreme soviet golikh said 
yuri kalmykov chairman of the jurisprudence committee said 
many deputies wanted someone with experience in industry and 
economics 
nevertheless after the renomination several lawmakers rose to 
praise yanayev and to urge support for gorbachev 
marshall sergei f akhromeyev a presidential adviser and former 
armed forces chief of staff urged all deputies to vote in the 
second round 
on the second ballot deputies voted 1230563 for yanayev the 
remaining ballots were not filled out or were declared invalid 
after an official announced the result of the ballot 
legislators joined by gorbachev sitting on the rostrum applauded 
yanayev sitting in a special section for party and government 
officials stood to acknowledge the applause 
gorbachev had initially planned to nominate eduard a 
shevardnadze for the job but shevardnadze resigned as foreign 
minister last week to protest what he said was a drift toward 
dictatorship 
in comments to the legislature after being nominated wednesday 
yanayev an ethnic russian supported gorbachevs reformist 
policies but also took a somewhat hardline tack calling for law 
and order 
yanayev belonged to the communist party youth organization 
komsomol in the early 1970s he came to moscow as chairman of the 
ussr committee of youth organizations he wrote his 
dissertation on international youth movements 
in the 1980s he served for six years as deputy chairman of the 
soviet friendship society which maintains nongovernmental 
contacts with foreigners 
he later returned to party work becoming a secretary of the 
policymaking central committee he was elected to the partys 
ruling politburo in july after a party shakeup that also 
significantly reduced its authority 
yanayev is leader in parliament of the 730member communist 
bloc

president carlos menem said 
thursday he will pardon a general who was extradited from the 
united states to stand trial for murders committed during the 
197683 dictatorship 
the general carlos suarez mason commanded an army corps 
responsible for the greater buenos aires area during the militarys 
dirty war against suspected leftist subversives 
more than half of the 8960 people who the government said were 
arrested and presumed killed during the crackdown came from his 
area 
menem said the general will be included in a pardon that will 
also free from jail former generals and military presidents jorge 
videla and roberto viola and mario eduardo firmenich cofounder 
of the leftist montonero guerrillas 
the presidential decree due by years end is necessary for 
national reconciliation menem told reporters 
the pardons are going to cancel a sad stage of the past that 
we have to overcome said menem referring to four army 
insurrections since 1987 and other signs of unresolved emotions 
that stem from the militarys dirty war against subversion 
the pardon is opposed by religious and human rights groups 
jurists leftist political parties and polls show between 60 and 
80 percent of all argentines 
suarez mason 66 has been in jail since arriving in handcuffs 
from california in may 1988 however his trial on 39 separate 
charges of murder was continually postponed in part because of the 
political nature of the case 
suarez mason led the first army corps following the march 1976 
overthrow of president isabel peron in 1978 he was promoted to 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff upon retiring in 1981 he 
was named president of the state oil monopoly ypf a post which he 
held until 1982 
raul alfonsin president from 198389 personally ordered suarez 
masons trial prosecutors wanted to charge him with 635 human 
rights abuses including 23 counts of kidnapping and 43 counts of 
murder and misappropriating 2 million from ypf 
however under terms of the extradition suarez mason may be 
prosecuted only for the 39 charges of murder which allegedly were 
committed by troops under his command 
for fleeing in 1984 when videla viola and other junta leaders 
were about to go on trial suarez mason was cashiered by his fellow 
generals 
suarez mason eventually settled under an assumed name in foster 
city calif a suburb of san francisco he was arrested in january 
1987 
the menem government in power since july 1989 apparently first 
intended to exclude suarez mason from the pardon of the handful of 
officers and terrorists not already pardoned 
however menem said the trial of suarez mason would only inflame 
public passions if he called officers to appear in his defense 
menem said such a trial would only renew public debate about the 
crackdown

the food and drug administration said thursday 
it will test raw milk weekly around the nation to determine if it 
contains certain antibiotics 
the agency said 250 locations across the country will be chosen 
for testing and raw milk samples will be collected each week from 
five of these sites selected randomly 
the samples will be tested for the presence of eight sulfa drugs 
and three tetracycline drugs the fda said that when residues are 
found the states will be told and the agency will help track down 
the source 
as newer analytical methods become available milk will be 
monitored for additional drugs the fda said in a statement 
the system will add another layer of protection for consumers 
rep ted weiss dny attacked the plan as inadequate 
testing five milk samples per week means that each processing 
location in fdas program will be visited only once a year he 
said in a statement fdas attempt to describe this as a 
nationwide program is ludicrous to even call it a modest proposal 
is a wild exaggeration 
weiss who is chairman of the house government operations 
subcommittee on human resources conducted hearings earlier this 
year on the fdas milktesting methods 
he said more hearings may be needed to examine whether the 
agency purposely designed a plan that would not find any residues 
fdas paltry effort will tell the public virtually nothing 
about the true extent of animal drug residues in milk said the 
congressman 
in november weiss released a general accounting office study 
that recommended the fda work with dairy states to improve 
screening tests for residues of drugs in milk the gao study said 
the agency should also test on a random basis the types and 
amounts of drug residues found in state screening samples 
raw and processed milk that is susceptible to interstate 
shipment is now tested by states for penicillin and 
penicillinrelated drug products the tests are not conducted 
routinely however for other antibiotic residues such as sulfa 
and tetracycline drugs under the current program the 50 states 
and the district of columbia test milk samples from every us 
dairy farm at least four times every six months 
antibiotics are often used by veterinarians to treat infections 
in dairy cattle testing is conducted to determine if residues from 
the drugs are present in the milk

texas house speaker gib lewis who 
weathered charges of unethical conduct to win reelection last 
month admits he went on a lobbyistpaid junket to mexico 
a topless dancer reportedly went along but lewis says he doesnt 
remember 
the trip is one of a variety of issues a grand jury apparently 
is examining as it investigates ties between texas legislators and 
lobbyists 
since the grand jury convened in november the investigation has 
spread into allegations of misconduct by up to 20 current and 
former lawmakers and lobbyists according to travis county district 
attorney ronnie earle 
the general subject has to do with the legislature and its 
relationship to the lobby earle said the grand jurys session 
was expanded for three months beyond its original dec 31 
expiration date 
lewis 54 is the best known legislator caught up in the 
investigation he was invited to appear before the panel thursday 
but said he would decline the invitation unless earle would say how 
he is connected to the investigation 
like lewis speakers in new york and california are under a 
cloud as the three states prepare for new legislative sessions 
new york state assembly speaker mel miller has pleaded innocent 
to federal mail fraud charges stemming from an alleged real estate 
scam miller claims the charges which are not connected to his 
legislative office are politically motivated 
california assembly speaker willie brown reportedly is being 
investigated about allegations that he was involved in legislation 
aimed at helping a regional garbage company get around local 
restrictions on landfills brown has not been charged with any 
crime and his spokesman has denied any impropriety on browns part 
the texas investigation reportedly has focused on trips taken by 
lewis one of the top three officials in state government to 
mexico and the caribbean with members of the law firm of heard 
goggan blair amp williams 
during the past eight years heard goggan has used a 
littlenoticed revision in state law to become one of only a few 
firms that can collect delinquent taxes 
the law allows a private firm hired by local governments to 
collect a 15 percent fee on top of overdue tax bills county 
attorneys collecting taxes cannot add the fee and legislative 
records show that numerous bills that would have diminished heard 
goggans taxcollecting business died in house committees 
oliver heard jr a spokesman for the san antonio law firm said 
he was not on the trip and had no personal knowledge of it 
were cooperating fully with the investigation heard added 
lewis a democrat from fort worth has been speaker for eight 
years controlling the house by assigning bills to committees 
naming their chairmen and directing floor debate he is seeking an 
unprecedented fifth term in january 
lewis admitted trip to mexico in april 1987 appears to have 
attracted most of the investigators attention 
six women including a topless dancer named chrissee 
accompanied lewis four partners in the law firm and an austin 
lobbyist to a resort on the pacific coast of mexico the houston 
chronicle has reported 
lewis denied any wrongdoing and said he doesnt remember a 
topless dancer or anyone named chrissee on the trip 
he said he welcomes the inquiry bu has accused earle of 
spoonfeeding grand jurors selective evidence 
i think they are pretty much on a rabbit chase lewis said 
but im glad theyre doing it i want to cooperate with them 
do everything i can because i think the air needs to be cleared 
the media have reported for two years about lavish spending by 
special interest lobbyists trying to influence the legislature and 
other state officials 
govelect ann richards and lt govelect bob bullock have 
promised that ethics reform will be a top priority when the 
legislature convenes jan 8 
despite the grand jury investigation lewis reelection as 
speaker appears secure 
lewis has been involved in such controversies before he was 
fined for failing to disclose his business ties criticized for

albanias communist president has pledged 
to relinquish the partys constitutionally guaranteed leading role 
in society the state news agency reported thursday 
but the new opposition party said the communists were not moving 
toward real democracy it said it would continue to press for 
postponement of feb 10 elections so it has time to prepare and 
suggested that a referendum be held to set the date for the first 
multiparty ballot since the communists took power in 1944 
president ramiz alia facing mounting student protests and the 
threat of economic collapse has sped up reform in this stalinist 
nation he legalized an opposition party this month for the first 
time since the country fell under communist rule 
speaking at a national party conference wednesday alia said 
officials must deviate from many principles of socialism as the 
nation dismantles its hardline system 
according a report thursday from the official ata news agency 
alia also said parliament would begin action on constitutional 
amendments immediately after the feb 10 elections in which the 
party will face opposition candidates for the first time 
the communist party would demand upon its own initiative and 
free will changing the article in the constitution fixing 
juridically its leading role in the state system alia said 
until student protests earlier this month albania had refused 
to stray from communist orthodoxy in his speech wednesday alia 
stressed that despite the reforms the party does not intend to 
abandon its marxist ideology 
he promised however to reform the party and in a further sign 
of the countrys emergence from decades of selfimposed isolation 
to allow albanians to work abroad 
in the unusually frank speech he acknowledged that the economic 
situation was grave because of a severe drought this past year 
reduced exports and productivity and a failure to fulfill 
centrallyplanned targets 
but a democratic party cofounder gramoz pashko said from 
tirana thursday that the communists were not moving forward for 
realistic democratization of the country 
he charged that alias pledges for economic reform were only 
on paper as long as the party continues to cling to marxism 
pashko said that in the oppositions view the communists had to 
make a detailed analysis of the crisis this is needed to 
figure out how to emerge from the situation 
alia has edged cautiously toward reform but the communists still 
control virtually every sphere of public life 
on monday the government rejected the oppositions request to 
postpone the elections for two or three months to allow it more 
time to prepare an effective campaign 
in july thousands of albanians complaining of political 
repression and economic hardship streamed into foreign embassies 
and refused to leave until they were allowed to emigrate 
passports have been theoretically available to albanians since 
may but few of the backward nations 32 million citizens have the 
hard currency needed for foreign travel

new york states top court thursday threw 
out a 30 million lawsuit filed against omni magazine by a couple 
angered that their family photo illustrated an article about 
coffees effect on fertility 
the state court of appeals said in a unanimous decision it was 
reluctant to secondguess an editorial decision trial level and 
appellate courts also had rejected the familys lawsuit 
joseph and ida finger of saugerties ny and their six 
children were pictured beside an article titled caffeine and fast 
sperm in omnis june 1988 issue the article discussed medical 
research that indicated in vitro fertilization rates may be 
enhanced by exposing sperm to high concentrations of caffeine 
want a big family the photographs caption read maybe 
your sperm needs a cup of java in the morning tests reveal that 
caffeinespritzed sperm swim faster which may increase the chances 
for in vitro fertilization 
the couple who conceived their children naturally had been 
photographed for an article in a catholic publication said their 
lawyer paul gruner they werent aware that a photo service had 
given their picture to omni until a friend showed mrs finger the 
magazine he said 
when it became known in a small community the children were 
the subject of some ridicule gruner said 
the couple argued that their civil rights were violated because 
the picture was used without permission state law prohibits the 
use of a photograph without consent for purposes of advertising or 
trade 
court of appeals judge fritz alexander noted that courts have 
consistently refused to apply the civil rights law to news 
articles limiting those interpretations to advertising 
questions of newsworthiness are better left to reasonable 
editorial judgment and discretion alexander wrote 
alexander said the fingers had a misperception about the theme 
of the article which the judge said was more about increased 
fertility than in vitro or test tube fertilization 
the judge said theres clearly a real relationship between 
the fertility theme and a picture of six healthy attractive 
children who all bear a striking resemblance to their parents 
laura handman lawyer for omni said the article made it very 
clear that the medical findings are only in the laboratory stages 
you have to assume a certain degree of common sense by the 
reader handman said i dont think theres been any family 
created by six cases of in vitro fertilization coffee or no 
coffee 
but gruner said the decision gives the press too much freedom to 
use pictures of people with articles that have nothing to do with 
them

president bush on thursday sought to stem 
reports that us forces arent yet ready for offensive action in 
the persian gulf saying he was very comfortable with the 
firepower on hand 
however he declined to directly deny reports that the troops 
will not be prepared to launch an attack by jan 15 the deadline 
set by the united nations for iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
at one point during questioning on the matter bush told 
reporters at the white house ive said all i want to say about 
readiness 
i think it would be very useful if from the president and 
others there were fewer comments about readiness he said 
i feel that the situation is exactly where i was told it was 
going to be at this time bush said dont believe those 
reports youre reading he said referring to accounts that his 
military advisers have warned him that the us force will not be 
suitably prepared for offensive action until midfebruary by then 
more than 400000 troops and much more armor will be deployed in 
the region 
were going to fully implement the united nations 
resolutions which authorize force to get iraqi troops out of 
kuwait he said the united states will do its part to fulfill 
every single one of them 
he made the comments to reporters who encountered him in a white 
house hallway and later to a group gathered to watch him fly off 
to resume his vacation at camp david md after returning to the 
white house for part of the day 
bush met thursday morning with the soviet ambassador alexander 
bessmertnykh who delivered a message from soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev 
bush said the message contained friendly words of greeting 
from president gorbachev and i had a chance to ask the 
ambassador to give him our best wishes for a happy new year 
he said he discussed with the soviet envoy the current domestic 
turmoil in the soviet union where gorbachev is struggling to keep 
a lid on the explosive tugofwar between reformers and 
conservatives and the challenge to his own position 
bush said there had been no progress on setting a meeting 
between secretary of state james a baker iii and iraqi president 
saddam hussein to discuss a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis 
still he said he hopes for a peaceful solution 
the iraqis have insisted the baghdad meeting be jan 12 but 
bush said there will be no compromise on the us position of 
scheduling it no later than jan 3 
referring to a meeting earlier this week with defense secretary 
dick cheney and gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff after their visit to the gulf bush said im very 
comfortable with the briefing and the briefing i had was quite 
different than most of the stories im reading in the last day or 
two 
the new york times and washington post both cited unidentified 
sources this week as saying the top military advisers warned him 
the troops would not be ready to launch an attack by jan 15 
the president challenged reporters thursday to show me the 
quotes from cheney and powell and dismissed the stories as 
rumors of what somebody is alleged to have told me 
asked what they did tell him bush said im not going to tell 
you what they said but im going to tell you dont believe these 
reports youre reading 
its under control he said adding he has total 
confidence in his pentagon team dont be misled by these 
rabbit trails running through the snow out there 
the presidents comments were the latest in a series of 
mixedmessage statements by officials on preparations for a persian 
gulf war 
the administration has been casting about since last week to put 
a positive spin on statements by lt gen calvin waller in saudi 
arabia who was the first to publicly state that he would recommend 
bush wait until midfebruary to attack if that proves necessary 
but bush on saturday said the allied forces are ready to 
respond vigorously within 10 minutes if provoked 
cheney said last week that us forces would be in position to 
attack soon after jan 15 if necessary 
also on thursday 101 members of congress wrote bush urging him 
to hold off on a military strike to give international economic 
sanctions more time to take hold 
the letter drafted by rep george miller dcalif contends 
that the un vote authorizing use of force in the gulf does not 
commit or authorize the use of the united states armed forces 
in an armed conflict 
that authorization lies solely with the congress of the united 
states the letter said

irs commissioner fred t goldberg had decided to postpone the

holiday cheer 
but the plan backfired in this broward county community 
irs spokeswoman barbara nichols explained the irs delivers the 
forms to the postal service at least a week before christmas to be 
held for delivery after the holiday rush 
if some got delivered it was by mistake said postal 
service spokeswoman cesta ayers in miami probably one or two 
stationmasters got antsy 
rose said the early delivery was not too nice especially 
after they made a big thing out of it that they were going to mail 
them later

than 12 million in taxes on stock profits prosecutors announced 
thursday a day after he resigned from the governing party 
the case represents a new blow to prime minister toshiki kaifus 
liberal democrats the party was discredited last year by a 
separate scandal over political donations and bargain stock deals 
for dozens of influential politicians bureaucrats and businessmen

prosecutor yusuke yoshinaga said the doctor allegedly provided 
insider information to inamura from a third man now being tried on

inamura a former director general of the environment agency 
could be fined up to 237 million in back taxes and penalties 
local news reports quoted tax officials as saying tax officials

key provisions of indianas new law 
regulating outofstate trash are unconstitutional because they 
inhibit commerce among states a federal judge ruled thursday 
us district judge john d tinder permanently banned the state 
from enforcing three provisions concluding they violate the 
constitutions commerce clause allowing free trade among states 
the same protection that the commerce clause gives to the 
citizens of other states who feel the need to import waste into 
indiana protects indiana citizens when they export hazardous waste 
to other states tinder wrote 
those provisions in the constitution will protect future 
generations of hoosiers should they find the need to export even 
solid municipal waste to another state the opinion said 
tinders ruling came five months after the end of a trial on a 
lawsuit filed by two pennsylvania trash haulers theychallenged 
the law shortly after gov evan bayh signed it last spring 
one provision struck down thursday required a trash hauler to 
certify where the largest part of the waste in a shipment was 
generated another required an outofstate hauler to receive a 
health officers certification that the shipment contained no 
hazardous or infectious waste a third provision imposed a dumping 
fee equal to the fee charged at the landfill closest to the 
shipments point of origin 
bayh vacationing in south carolina issued a statement saying 
he will meet with the states congressional delegation and contact 
other governors to solicit help in getting federal law changed 
we will not let down in the fight against the indiscriminate 
dumping of east coast trash on indiana bayh said 
at the state level bayh said he has instructed the indiana 
department of environmental management to provide more inspections 
and tougher enforcement to stop illegal hazardous or infectious 
waste from entering indiana 
he said he also will meet with legislative leaders and consult 
with volunteer legal experts to consider new laws to stem the flow 
of outofstate trash 
attorney general linley e pearson said about a halfdozen other 
states had similar trash laws struck down on the commerce clause 
argument 
the indiana law was passed with bipartisan support after bayh 
and legislators expressed alarm their state had become a dumping 
ground for trash from eastern states 
the ruling doesnt disturb other provisions of the law that 
require solid waste management plans within indiana impose a 
tipping fee on all waste deposited within the state and require 
haulers of waste within indiana to certify the county of origin of 
the trash shipment tinder said 
those provisions are in effect 
the trash shippers attorney bruce l thall said the same 
provisions that made the law politically popular undermined its 
chances to withstand legal challenge 
this was a palpably unconstitutional attempt just to stop 
outofstate trash at the borders said thall who represented 
government suppliers consolidating services inc and jack castenova 
inc

president fidel castro declared a general 
amnesty for pigs meaning cubans will forgo their traditional 
holiday meal of pork because of hard times cubas official news 
agency prensa latina said thursday 
about 200000 pigs will survive the new year festivities in 
cuba as part of the official strategy to protect livestock it 
said in a dispatch from havana monitored in mexico city 
castro personally defended the porkless holiday when questioned 
by lawmakers during the yearend parliamentary session on farm 
production 
people asked why there was no pork in the markets prensa 
latina said it was necessary to explain the reasons 
castro said massive holiday slaughter would have cost the lives 
of young pigs in the prime of their reproductive lives and made 
pork scare in january february and march 
we have decreed a general amnesty for pigs he said as 
parliament burst into laughter and applause 
communist cuba is in the grip of its most serious economic 
crisis since castro took power 32 years ago the president has been 
bracing his island nation for even tougher times when soviet aid is 
sharply reduced castro says he is putting cuba on the sort of 
austerity footing that would come in wartime 
oxen are replacing tractors city dwellers are being sent to the 
countryside to work in the fields and food fuel and manufactured 
goods are being rationed 
cuba now relies on the soviet union for 90 percent of its oil 
and 70 percent of its trade but the soviets will stop paying cuba 
abovemarket prices for sugar next year and will start charging 
market prices for oil

finance minister yitzhak modai in remarks 
broadcast thursday said he has used public funds to buy the 
support of coalition partners and keep the rightwing governments 
cabinet from collapsing 
modais remarks follow reports that some ultraorthodox parties 
in the cabinet were demanding more government money for their 
religious schools and other institutions as a price for support 
on wednesday state comptroller miriam benporat issued an 
unusually harsh report accusing the ultraorthodox torah guardians 
faction of concealing records of transactions with state funds 
israeli reports said the money amounts to hundreds of thousands of 
dollars 
the factions support is crucial to maintaining prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs narrow majority of 62 in the 120member 
parliament 
in his remarks broadcast on army radio modai said the 
government was in danger of collapse he was speaking wednesday 
night to supporters in the coastal city of netanya 
if you only knew how many government crises i have bought off 
in the past few months not with jobs as cabinet ministers but 
with money he said there is no other way of preserving this 
structure 
we have lost the component of personal example in leadership 
our government doesnt project stability modai was quoted as 
saying 
the finance minister who heads a breakaway faction of shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc did not elaborate his spokesman could not 
be reached immediately for comment 
the reports of demands for funds by orthodox parties have 
stirred controversay bcause they come at a time when the government 
is increasing income taxes to finance an unprecedented wave of 
soviet immigration nearly 200000 soviet immigrants are expected 
this year 
in her comments wednesday benporat the state comptroller 
said on israel television that parliamentary financial records kept 
by communications minister rafael pinchasi of the torah guardians 
party were intentionally hidden from me 
reading from her report benporat added that evidence suggests 
the main reason for hiding the listings is that much of the 
money went to religious seminary students who worked in the partys 
election campaign 
exposure of their names was liable to hurt them in terms 
of army recruitment and taxes she added 
many religious youths are exempted from compulsory military duty 
if they can prove their time is being devoted to study of the 
scriptures 
she also sent a copy of her inquiry to state attorney general 
yosef harish a step usually taken when a criminal suit is being 
considered israeli reports said 
police have been investigating the issue for three months after 
evidence of graft surfaced during a separate inquiry centering on 
interior minister aryeh deri a prominent member of the torah 
guardians israel radio said 
deri has denied any wrongdoing the investigation is reportedly 
still under way

the census bureaus dayold population count 
came under swift criticism thursday from a key congressman and some 
state and local officials who argued it had missed many urban 
americans and would cost large cities federal funds 
the bush administration official in charge of the census 
michael darby defended it as full fair and accurate 
rep tom sawyer dohio chairman of the house census 
subcommittee said the ppulation count may be the first one to 
be less accurate than its predecessor he noted the total was 47 
million people below an estimate made in october and added 
were saying the apparent discrepancy is cause for concern 
the count released on wednesday pegged population in the united 
states excluding nearly 1 million americans living abroad at 
2487 million an increase of nearly 10 percent from a decade ago 
in general it showed large population gains in california 
arizona florida and other sun belt states and far smaller 
increases in the industrial northern states and the agricultural 
heartland 
the governor of new york and the mayor of meridian miss 
called separately for continued legal challenges to the count the 
census process has been criticized throughout the year by municipal 
and state officials who say it skips people in urban areas 
particularly the poor 
the census numbers are important to those officials because they 
determine how many representatives each state sends to congress and 
how much federal aid states counties and cities will get an area 
thats undercounted for example will have less political clout 
and will get less federal money 
new york will continue to make every effort both in the courts 
and elsewhere to have all new yorkers counted so that we can 
maintain our vital and important voice in washington and ensure our 
fair share of federal dollars said new york gov mario cuomo 
we know where those 5 million folks are jimmy kemp mayor 
of meridian miss said of the difference between the october 
estimate and this weeks count youre going to find them in your 
cities where you have the most economically disadvantaged folks 
rep thomas ridge rpa and senior republican on the census and 
population subcommittee said it was wrong to call the difference 
between the october guesstimate and this weeks count a 
discrepancy 
the fact that you couldnt hit the projection in my view is 
not legitimate grounds for criticizing the enumeration process 
itself ridge said 
the census bureau said this week that there were in fact 2496 
million americans but it isnt accurate to compare that figure to 
the 1980 tally because it includes 1 million americans living 
abroad who werent counted ten years earlier 
darby the under secretary of commerce in charge of the census 
bureau said he believed the 1990 census was full fair and 
accurate but he added no one now can say how accurate 
right now we dont know just how good the census is and 
wont know until statistical checks have been completed this 
summer darby said certainly theres no valid basis for making a 
judgment about an undercount or overcount at this point 
more than 6000 local governments including the nations 51 
largest cities filed challenges against preliminary figures with

state wildlife officials put off a decision 
thursday on a temporary plan to kill wandering bison from 
yllowstone national park to ensure they dont spread disease to 
cattle 
the plan which was the subject of a hearing includes a 
provision to have federal rangers help state wardens kill the cows 
that wander outside the park 
officials say cows are more likely to carry the disease 
brucellosis than bulls and putting the responsibility for their 
killing in the hands of wardens and rangers should reduce the 
chances of their spreading disease 
about half of the 2500 to 3000 bison in the 2millionacre 
park are believed to carry brucellosis a disease that causes 
cattle to abort montana spent millions of dollars over a decade to 
eradicate brucellosis in its cattle 
hunters would continue killing bulls outside the park and calves 
would be captured sterilized and sold at auction 
animal rights groups are lined up solidly against killing the 
animals contending the threat of passing brucellosis from bison to 
domestic cattle is minimal or nonexistent 
the montana department of livestock and the montana 
stockgrowers association are equally adamant in demanding the 
invading bison not be allowed even the slightest chance to 
contaminate public and private rangeland abutting the parks 
northern and western boundaries 
the plan has caused a furor this winter with critics 
including some sport hunters complaining that killing the bison 
has wounded montanas reputation as a refuge for wildlife 
lets get hunters out of the business of shooting bison 
brian kahn of helena said during thursdays hearing 
he characterized himself as a lifelong hunter and supporter of 
hunting and said state officials must take a serious look at 
what this bison hunt is doing to the image of hunting 
knute hereim a rancher from martinsdale representing the 
stockgrowers association said livestock producers support the 
states attempt to keep infected bison from possibly reinfecting 
montana herds 
he said officials in yellowstone have not taken steps to control 
the animal health risk immediate action must be taken he 
said 
pat graham associate director of the state department of fish 
wildlife and parks said all comment submitted at thursdays 
hearing a previous hearing dec 14 and written comment would be 
assessed before a final decision is made probably next week 
a decision had been scheduled for friday graham said there is 
no immediate threat of hundreds of bison moving from the park into 
montana giving the department longer than originally anticipated 
to make its decision 
during both public hearings this month and in much of the 
written comment the national park service has been criticized for 
not controlling bison movements or cleansing the herds of 
brucellosis 
yellowstone superintendent robert barbee said earlier that the 
park is cooperating fully with attempts to find a longterm 
solution to the bison problem he also said the call by montana 
officials for the us department of agriculture to issue a 
quarantine order for the park was inappropriate 
the fund for animals based in new york city filed suit in 
federal court against the bison control plan it contends the plan 
reflects a shootanythingthatmoves mentality by state 
wildlife officials 
in written testimony the fund contended the plan is biased in 
favor of the selfserving interests of montanas livestock 
industry it called for nonlethal means of controlling the 
infected animals 
so far this winter only hunters have been used to kill bison 
wandering across the parks border in the region near west 
yellowstone eleven bulls have been killed 
two seasons ago 569 bison were killed

the chinese characters that can be 
used to name babies in south korea will be legally restricted 
starting next year to make it easier for the government to keep 
computer records of its citizens 
in a ruling published thursday the supreme court said 2731 
chinese characters will be legally recognized beginning in april 
eliminating thousands of others 
the court said the ruling is meant to facilitate computerization 
of family registers and avoid the confusion that often arises from 
having to transliterate complicated chinese characters 
fewer and fewer koreans read chinese and many prefer the simpler 
korean hangul alphabet for naming children 
critics of the decision say the number of strokes in a name is a 
crucial determinant of fate and claim that the restriction 
infringes on their right to choose their childs name 
in 20 to 30 years when babies born after 1991 are adults the 
use of chinese characters will have declined to such an extent that 
nobody but the namecarriers themselves may be able to read such 
names the court said 
unlike china hong kong and japan which belong to the same 
language group as korea korea has not transfigured or simplified 
the chinese characters it uses

a leading rabbi has outraged holocaust 
survivors and secular israelis by claiming that the nazi genocide 
was gods punishment for sins such as violating the jewish sabbath 
and eating pork 
hundreds of israelis called a radio talk show thursday to let 
off steam about the remarks of rabbi eliezer schach 97 an 
ultraorthodox rabbinical sage who by a quirk of the electoral 
system also happens to be the kingmaker of israeli governments 
about 6 million jews perished in the holocaust and tens of 
thousands of survivors live in israel the uproar over schachs 
remarks reflected the deep sensitivity still felt in this country 
over the holocaust 45 years after the last death camp was 
liberated 
not for a long time has any single remark caused such an 
emotional reaction said razi barkai the host of the israel 
radio talk show he said calls ran about 32 against the rabbi 
at one level schach was simply repeating a theme common in the 
bible of divine retribution against the jewish people for straying 
from the path of their religious law 
but at another level many took his remarks to mean that the 
jews somehow were to blame for the nazis behavior 
the almighty keeps a balance sheet of the world and when the 
sins become too many he brings destruction we dont know how long 
his patience holds out sometimes 20 years sometimes 10 and 
sometimes only a year schach told jewish seminary students 
earlier this week 
the last time he brought destruction it was the holocaust 
because of the sins the almighty may bring another holocaust 
upon us and it may already be tomorrow he warned 
these sins according to schach include violating the sanctity 
of the sabbath and eating pork which is banned by jewish dietary 
law 
some of schachs sharpest critics were holocaust survivors 
menahem russak a survivor of the auschwitz concentration camp 
and a former commander of the israeli police unit investigating 
nazi war crimes said schach shamed and humiliated millions of 
holocaust victims 
his voice shaking russak told listeners that schach not only 
exonerated the nazi murderers but turned them into messengers of 
god who were sent to punish the people of israel for not observing 
the torah 
but another caller an ultraorthodox woman who lost relatives 
in the holocaust defended the rabbi 
with all the pain i have i can understand his words we 
believe in the link between sin and punishment said the woman 
who did not give her name 
sociologist menachem friedman an expert on religious 
communities said schachs views reflect ultraorthodox thinking 
prevalent since the 1950s 
but secular israelis only began listening after the 
ultraorthodox left their selfchosen isolation and entered israeli 
politics in the 1980s friedman said 
rabbi schach today is one of the most powerful men in israeli 
politics and each one of his words creates a lot of noise 
friedman said in an interview 
earlier this year schach in effect made yitzhak shamir prime 
minister by ordering his political supporters to join shamirs 
coalition 
five percent of israels jewish residents are ultraorthodox 
another 5 percent are sympathizers and 20 percent are observant 
but not fundamentalist another 70 percent define themselves as 
secular according to friedman 
the secular public tends to stereotype ultraorthodox jews like 
schach as throwbacks to the jews ghetto years who never embraced 
the zionist cause for one thing they speak yiddish the language 
of the ghetto in europe rather than hebrew the symbol of reborn 
israel 
indeed schach delivered his controversial remarks in yiddish 
and israel radio had to give listeners a translation into hebrew 
the visibility of the ultraorthodox those speeches are 
creating a harsh antagonism friedman said

a cold wave that ruined californias navel 
orange crop which could make the fruit scarce and pricy is 
robbing thousands of citrus workers of their jobs agriculture 
experts say 
about 450 people were fired wednesday at lobue bros one of the 
biggest packing houses in the san joaquin valley 
it was with deep regret that we had to discharge that many 
people the day after christmas said general manager ga 
wollenman thats no kind of christmas present 
joel nelsen manager of california citrus mutual a growers 
organization estimated 15000 people will be out of work the 
states estimated 70 citrus packing houses will have nothing for 
them to do an undetermined number of harvest workers will also 
have to look elsewhere for jobs he said 
the damage to crops inflicted by the sustained freeze that 
gripped much of the country before christmas occurred mostly in 
california said a report by the federal joint agricultural 
facility in washington 
hardest hit was the california navel orange crop which 
comprises nearly 2 percent of the states annual 165 billion 
agricultural yield 
about 80 percent of the current crop remained unpicked when the 
freeze hit and thus was destroyed 
i do not believe there is a lemon or orange in the san joaquin 
valley said farmer don laux we basically dont have anything 
left its over 
california navels generally are sold fresh in contrast to 
floridas 13 billion orange crop which mainly becomes juice 
the dollar loss to californias navel orange crop was estimated 
thursday at 286 million to 288 million by agriculture officials 
in the three san joaquin valley counties where they are grown 
commercially 
industry observers said the frost caused the worst damage anyone 
can remember 
prices could double because of the severe damage in the 
central valley said claire peters of sunkist growers marketing 
cooperative for about 6000 california and arizona growers 
the fruit will be welltested so the quality should be fine 
but there wont be as much and it will be more expensive peters 
said 
no price increases were found at several major southern 
california supermarket chains checked thursday but produce 
department managers for the vons and ralphs chains said they 
expected a rise in the current price of 69 cents per pound 
meanwhile some growers and packers are seeking federal relief 
and workers are lining up at unemployment offices 
brad stark said he would have to lay off between 200 and 300 
people at his packing shed in a normal year his plants pack more 
than 3 million cartons of oranges this year less than 5 percent 
of the fruit can be salvaged and stark expects his losses to 
approach 30 million 
as citrus farmers are trying to reckon the damage wrought by the 
prechristmas freeze others are concerned about a second cold snap 
headed their way 
thirdgeneration farmer gary cavilia knows hes already lost 
this years crop of oranges but so far his trees have withstood 
the cold 
another freeze predicted for the weekend could cause tree 
splits extensive tree splits could set farmers back up to five 
years thats how long it would take to have trees fully producing 
crops again 
most farmers myself included are not quitters said dave 
daguerre who owns a 30acre orchard but the thing that is 
really scary is this next storm if it drops rain and freezes i 
dont think anyone has any hope 
cavilia has invested about 1100 an acre on his 150acre 
orchard this season 
its going to be a belttightening year he said im just 
struggling to keep my trees alive

beginning jan 1 residents of beijing will have 
to pay double the regular fare for bus and subway tickets and up to 
10 times as much to stroll in a park as the city tries to reduce 
price subsidies an official report said thursday 
the new rates still fail to cover the citys costs to run the 
public transit and parks systems the beijing evening news said 
but it did not indicate whether further increases were likely soon 
even for chinese the new rates remain relatively low a bus 
ride across the central city will cost 3 cents for example or 
less than 3 percent of the average workers daily wages 
most city parks have charged less than 1 cent for entry and now 
will charge 9 cents 
for years governments at all levels in communist china have 
heavily subsidized virtually every public service and product sold 
to urban residents from housing to rice at a cost of billions of 
dollars annually 
prices have been increased selectively the past decade in an 
effort to reduce the burden of subsidies but authorities have 
failed to overhaul the entire price system as economists have 
urged for fear of causing social unrest that might threaten the 
communist partys rule 
after striving through most of 1989 and 1990 to hold prices 
down officials said recently that the public is ready to accept a 
new round of increases in november sugar prices went up about 45 
percent nationwide and cotton cloth prices rose about 25 percent 
in beijing the price of coal briquettes used by most families 
in cooking stoves more than doubled none of these increases 
prompted public complaints

four moslem fundamentalists on thursday 
appealed to israels supreme court to overturn an army order 
deporting them from the occupied gaza strip 
in the occupied west bank three arabs were wounded by shots 
fired into their car an anonymous caller said jewish extremists 
were responsible for the attack 
the un security council condemned the expulsion order last 
week in a resolution that also urged more protection for the 17 
million palestinians living under israeli occupation in the west 
bank and gaza 
three high court judges will hear the appeal but no hearing 
date has been set israel radio reported the high court has never 
overturned an expulsion order 
the deportation order issued earlier this month was the first 
in 16 months and came despite a plea by secretary of state james a 
baker iii for israel not to expel palestinians 
also thursday the supreme court upheld a police decision 
banning israeli and palestinian women from holding a joint peace 
march this weekend along the green line which separated arab 
east jerusalem from the jewish western sector until 1967 
the court accepted the police argument that public 
demonstrations should be banned this week and next to prevent any 
disturbances connected with tuesdays 26th anniversary of the 
founding of fatah yasser arafats mainstream plo faction 
after the three arabs were wounded an anonymous caller told 
israel army radio we are zionist jews and we attacked three 
arabs near the gush etzion junction 
the army command said the arabs were wounded near the jewish 
settlement efrat it said no soldiers were involved 
in the west bank a 30yearold palestinian died thursday of a 
bullet wound suffered in a clash with israeli troops on march 15 
1988 arab reports said he had been hit in the back and paralyzed 
from the waist down 
the arab was identified as khiary mahmoud of the village of 
anza doctors said he had been treated in jordan before being 
returned to alittihad hospital in nablus this week 
mahmouds death raised to 781 the number of palestinians killed 
by israeli soldiers or civilians in the 3yearold uprising against 
israeli occupation 
an additional 332 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
most on suspicion of collaborating with israel fiftyseven 
israelis have died in the violence 
the army issued its deportation order on dec 15 a day after 
three israelis were stabbed to death in a suburb of tel aviv and 
slogans painted at the murder scene claimed responsibility for 
hamas an outlawed moslem fundamentalist organization 
the army blamed the four men for inciting the murders not for 
the crime itself the two suspects in the slaying have not been 
caught 
on tuesday a military appeals panel upheld the deportation 
order saying the four incited antiisraeli violence as senior 
activists in hamas arabic for zeal 
defense attorney abdul malek dahamshe who filed the high court 
appeal said thursday the hearing before the military panel 
violated proper legal procedures 
we had no chance to bring witnesses we couldnt consult with 
them our clients and we couldnt consult with other attorneys 
dahamshe told israel radio 
the men facing expulsion are fadel khadel zaabut 34 a college 
instructor in gaza city emad khaled el alami 34 a civil 
engineer mustafa youssef abdul el lidawi 26 and mustafa ahmed el 
qnuih 45 
israel has expelled 60 palestinians from the occupied 
territories to neighboring countries since the beginning of the 
uprising 
western nations including the united states have deplored the 
practice as a violation of the fourth geneva convention which bars 
expulsions from occupied lands 
also thursday police blocked a handful of jewish zealots from 
going up to jerusalems temple mount saying their planned 
demonstration was raising tension in the moslem community 
a planned march by the temple mount faithful group on oct 8 
initiated a riot in which at least 17 palestinians died in police 
gunfire 
the groups goal is to rebuild the ancient jewish temple on the 
temple mount which is known to moslems as haram essharif or noble 
sanctuary and is the site of two historic mosques

the wife of prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov on 
thursday blamed deliberate criticism of her 61yearold husband 
for his suffering a heart attack after a session of the congress of 
peoples deputies this week 
ryzhkov felled tuesday was reported in serious condition 
thursday but his wife ludmilla said he could smile again and that 
he wants to return to work after his recovery 
she also told tass in what the state news agency called a 
tearful interview that the prime minister disagrees with some 
government changes but she gave no details 
we failed to take a leave and nikolai was nearly exhausted 
she said but his fatigue resulted not so much from work which 
he liked very much and not from critical remarks but from 
excessive attacks that were clearly exaggerated persistent and 
deliberate 
earlier thursday president mikhail s gorbachev told parliament 
ryzhkovs condition is serious but is not worsening 
mrs ryzhkov said her husband suffered a myocardic infarction 
of medium gravity the pain has somewhat subsided but some 
time will be needed to stabilize his emotional state 
thousands of letters and telegrams have arrived wishing 
nikolai a speedy recovery 
she said he never had heart problems before he felt pains 
tuesday morning during parliament debate but said nothing hoping 
it would pass by itself the congress on tuesday began debate on 
constitutional amendments one will replace ryzhkovs council of 
ministers with a smaller cabinet under presidential control a 
prime minister will head it but nobody has been named to the job 
yet 
his wife said ryzhkov wanted to remain in government to work 
not for individual politicians but for the state 
ryzhkov was assailed by reformists after a political battle last 
fall over an economic reform plan to create a market economy in the 
soviet union his announcement of price increases over the summer 
set off a rush on stores until the government canceled the plans 
russian republic president boris n yeltsin repeatedly demanded 
ryzhkovs removal as prime minister and called his economic 
proposals too conservative 
tass paraphrased mrs ryzhkov as saying her husbands address to 
the congress on its third day last week was too heavy a load 
ryzhkov delivered a gloomy report on the soviet economy while 
defending gorbachev and himself against criticism from both right 
and left 
the heart attack followed a long day of parliamentary debate 
ryzhkov returned home about midnight but could not sleep and woke 
mrs ryzhkov up at 3 am she said 
he was very pale and his forehead was covered in cold 
perspiration she said 
she called a doctor and he was taken to a hospital at 4 am 
she said 
they told me that on the way to the clinic he tried to keep 
up the doctors spirit by attempting to joke mrs ryzhkov said

boris fyodorov russias 33yearold finance 
minister who led efforts to create a market economy in the vast 
republic has resigned in frustration over stalled progress on his 
plan 
he said in an interview published thursday with rossiiskaya 
gazeta the official newspaper of the russian supreme soviet 
legislature that russian lawmakers have been unwilling to take 
necessary but unpopular measures such as lifting artificial price 
controls and allowing private ownership 
regrettably there is nothing like progress toward the 
market fyodorov was quoted as saying 
the impact of fyodorovs resignation wednesday could not 
immediately be gauged but it was certain to raise questions by 
fledgling investors and entrepreneurs in the largest of the soviet 
unions 15 republics 
russian federation president boris n yeltsin moscow mayor 
gavriil popov and other reformers have been trying to attract 
foreign investors and cultivate russian businesses to stimulate the 
economy 
two stock exchanges recently have been founded in moscow 
although with few stocks or bonds to be traded hundreds of 
jointventure companies and independent cooperative businesses 
already are operating in the republic despite a maze of government 
ministries laws and red tape 
fyodorov told the newspaper that decisions such as forming 
private companies setting up a stock market and bringing russian 
accounting practices in line with international norms get bogged 
down in the depths of the apparatus of the russian council of 
ministers for months on end 
the chairman of the council of ministers or cabinet is ivan 
silayev a former minister under soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev who was elected to the job over yeltsins objections 
silayev criticized fyodorov in the russian republic parliament 
on thursday and proposed deputy finance minister igor lazarev as a 
replacement 
but after a heated debate a final decision was put off 
until the next session the state news agency tass reported 
parliament made lazarev acting finance minister until a replacement 
is found it said 
cabinet ministers seem to believe in all seriousness that they 
can run the economy as they would run a factory fyodorov was 
quoted as saying populist measures involving ever new outlays 
are taken one after another while the revenue base is being 
curtailed 
this is a shortcut to financial bankruptcy for the republic 
and for the soviet union as a whole 
on nov 1 the russian federation began a program to switch from 
a centrally planned command economy to a free market within 500 
days russian lawmakers said they wanted to move faster than the 
national government but their policies often conflict and create 
confusion rather than reform 
fyodorov is credited with helping draft russias version of the 
500day plan and was a member of the joint russiansoviet committee 
that tried to merge the governments divergent plans 
a devotee of british economic policies under former prime 
minister magaret thatcher fyodorov holds a doctorate in economics 
from the moscow institute of finance he has worked for the huge 
soviet economic planning agency gosplan and the prestigious 
institute for economics and international relations 
a serious dispute between the russian federation and the central 
government threatens the nations solvency 
gorbachev told the congress of peoples deputies that russian 
lawmakers agreed to provide only 374 billion toward the national 
budget for next year 190 billion less than the republics 
contribution this year 
the russians complain they dont get enough back from the 
national budget to justify their contribution 
gorbachev said that if other republics follow russias lead and 
cut their contributions the result would be a collapse not only 
of the economy but of the union 
he urged the russian parliament to suspend its decision

and ill the study found 
threequarters of the 1000 people who responded to the random 
telephone survey said they would like to volunteer to help the less 
fortunate but are too busy said donald e banker a vice 
president at lions club international which commissioned the 
study 
the lions club claims to be the worlds largest service 
organization with nearly 14 million members in 171 countries 
were concerned about the lack of participation in our 
association by the younger generation banker said thursday in a 
telephone interview from california there seems to be a 
hesitancy to get involved 
fortyone percent of the respondents said they would rather 
donate money than volunteer their time the survey conducted last 
spring questioned people ages 25 to 40 and had a margin of error 
of plus or minus 3 percentage points 
the survey found that among the respondents who said they had 
performed any volunteer work including helping at church or 
school many shied away from longterm commitments 
eighteen percent of volunteers said they spent time with 
children compared to 5 percent with the homeless and 4 percent 
with people with mental disabilities or cancer twelve percent of 
volunteers said they worked with people with physical disabilities 
children are always no 1 because volunteers can make an 
immediate difference there said jean davis a spokeswoman for 
the midwest regional office of the salvation army in chicago 
with the homeless it takes a monumental effort to make a 
change sometimes you cant solve the problem and its 
frustrating she said 
john donahue executive director of the chicago coalition for 
the homeless said americans should give more time to volunteer 
efforts 
to really resolve the problem nationally people have to make 
the commitment rearrange their priorities donahue said 
the washington dcbased national coalition for the homeless 
estimates 3 million homeless people live in the united states 
donahue said 
davis said the salvation army takes any help it can get and 
designs its volunteer programs to accommodate peoples hectic 
schedules 
we dont really have any problems getting people to volunteer 
so long as we keep it shortterm davis said we have always 
had shortterm projects where a person does not need to commit for 
a year or two years they can take on one family or visit one 
home

more than 100000 algerians marched 
through the capital and past the presidential palace thursday to 
protest plans to ban use of foreign languages in all official 
business 
protesters said the proposal stems from political and religious 
intolerance and from excessively rapid arabization of this northafrican 
country 
hocine aitahmed leader of the opposition front of socialist 
forces accused the government of complicity with islamic 
forces who he said championed the law 
he was not specific but the moslem fundamentalist islamic 
salvation front has emerged as the main opposition party after 
winning local elections last summer it tried to enforce the 
islamic dress code in several towns 
the language restriction would impact most on french speakers 
french is the working language for many residents of this former 
french colony but is considered elitist 
it competes with berber spoken by nearly a third of algerias 
27 million people 
in his comments during the protest thursday aitahmed spoke 
arabic and berber 
under the proposed law arabic must be used in all official 
transactions and schools by 1997 with fines of up to 10000 for 
violators 
the algerian constitution cites arabic as the national language 
but does not forbid use of foreign languages 
the national legislature passed the measure 1738 it must be 
signed by president chadli bendjedid before it can take effect

the acting army chief of suriname 
said thursday the armed forces had acted legally in ousting the 
elected president and pledged that legislators will elect a new 
chief executive this week 
cmdr ivan graanoogst said the militarys overthrow of president 
ramsewak shankar was constitutional because the national assembly 
had been left in power he denied the takeover was a military coup 
the assembly convened thursday morning for the first time since 
shankar was overthrown the constitution requires it to elect a new 
president and vice president when their posts are vacant 
graanoogst said shankar and vice president henck arron would 
present their resignations to the assembly 
it will elect new chief executives to be installed saturday and 
they will set the date for elections to be held within 100 days 
graanoogst said the assembly will also pick a new cabinet he 
said 
there is no coup at all graanoogst said on television 
the united states the netherlands france and others who have 
protested are premature 
surinamese returned to work after the traditional twoday 
christmas holiday there was no unusual military presence in the 
streets of the capital of paramaribo or any sign of protest 
however the us state department advised americans not to 
travel to suriname and for those living there to remain indoors 
suriname a former dutch colony is an ethnically diverse 
country of 400000 people on south americas northeastern coast 
the organization of american states summoned member states to a 
special meeting friday to discuss a venezuelan request for prompt 
action to restore the constitutional government in suriname 
venezuela announced a day earlier it would not recognize the new 
government and demanded a firm response to the bloodless 
ouster 
however neighboring brazil a major power in south america 
said through its embassy in venezuela that it was opposes 
intervention 
in defense of the military action graanoogst referred to two 
articles in the constitution that give the armed forces authority 
to ensure a peaceful transition to a democratic and socially just 
society 
graanoogst is no 2 in the fivemember military authority headed 
by cmdr desi bouterse who is believed to be a key power behind 
the scenes 
bouterse ruled as dictator from 198287 and resigned as military 
chief just before the takeover graanoogst head of the military 
police stepped in as acting military head 
a journalist who asked not to be identified for fear of 
reprisals said shankar and arron were resigning at gunpoint 
shankar was quoted by the newspaper de ware tijd as saying he is 
allowed to move freely but is staying home to prevent any 
escalations 
shankar was elected by the assembly in 1988 after his 
threeparty coalition the front for democracy and development won 
parliamentary elections a year earlier by a landslide shankars 
ouster coincided with growing popular discontent over surinames 
deepening economic crisis 
high inflation and unemployment have made it difficult for most 
surinamese to pay for their basic needs the government has a 
monthly trade deficit of 10 million 
the downward spiral began during bouterses rule major factors 
were the militarys inexperience in managing the economy a drop in 
the world price of bauxite the countrys major export and 
guerrilla warfare that disrupted production

american airlines inc said thursday it will 
reduce its schedule by about 4 percent and lay off an unspecified 
number of employees because it cant count on pilots showing up for 
work 
the fort worthbased carrier the nations second largest 
claims pilots have been staging sickouts taxiing slowly to waste 
fuel and filing frivolous requests for equipment maintenance 
the allied pilots association which represents the carriers 
8700 pilots have been in contract talks since october 1989 the 
old contract expired jan 1 
the carrier won a temporary restraining order late wednesday 
barring pilots from actions designed to influence contract 
negotiations which have grown increasingly tense 
but even with the court order we cannot count on all of our 
pilots coming to work american spokesman tim smith said 
thursday 
by late thursday 24 flights were canceled 13 of them 
crewrelated smith said since sunday 352 flights have been 
canceled including 78 that were crewrelated 
the airline handles about 2300 flights per day 
in a letter to cockpit crews sent dec 26 and released thursday 
robert w baker americans executive vice president for 
operations said the job action will force the carrier to reduce 
its schedule 
unhappily that will cause us to issue layoff notices to a 
number of employees in various categories and to increase the 
number and percentage of pilots on reserve baker said 
placing a pilot on reserve effectively reduces pay to a 
guaranteed minimum number of hours 
a jan 3 hearing date has been set by us district judge john 
mcbryde to determine whether the temporary injunction should be 
made permanent 
the allied pilots association called the temporary restraining 
order a rush to judgment and said it would challenge the ruling 
later 
american spokesman marty heires said about 60 pilots called in 
sick shortly after the injunction was announced but other pilots 
apparently decided to obey the court order 
its difficult to tell but i would say that last night we saw 
a pretty substantial spike in the number of pilots who were calling 
in sick heires said however as the evening wore on that 
number was offset by the number of pilots reporting back to work 
under the railway labor act airline employees cannot strike 
unless a federal judge declares talks to be at an impasse and sets 
a 30day cooling off period 
americans complaint alleged pilot actions also are prohibited 
under the act 
since last april american airlines officials said there has 
been a marked increase in pilots sick leave pilot sick hours 
peaked at 28082 for november compared with 19319 pilot sick 
hours in november 1989 
on nov 27 386 american airlines pilots were out sick tying 
the company record for most out in one day 
american said daily flight delays attributable to pilot actions 
have run as high as 215 on dec 19 compared with an average of 89 
delays per day in 1989 
the chief issue in the talks is money the pilots say they want 
to eliminate the socalled bscale salary schedule or narrow the 
differences under the scale pilots hired after 1983 are paid less 
and advance at a slower rate compared with pilots hired before 
1983

as predicted the nations most famous 
psychics failed to accurately forecast 1990 news events and in most 
cases were just plain wrong the san francisco bay area skeptics 
said thursday 
predictions that fizzled included a jackie onassis marriage to 
rock star jon bon jovi and a tidal wave flooding new york city 
did you hear the one about the meteorite landing in the white 
house rose garden or the japanese finding a cure for the common 
cold 
these predictions can prove harmful even dangerous said 
robert steiner the skeptics spokesman it becomes dangerous 
when you let other people control your lives with them 
each year the skeptics dig up the predictions made the year 
before to the embarrassment of those who made them steiner said 
steiner said no psychic predicted the genuinely surprising news 
stories of 1990 including the stunning electoral defeat of the 
sandinistas in nicaragua 
the years top stories were so unanticipated that someone 
would have had to be really psychic to have predicted them the 
group said in a statement 
the skeptics describe themselves as a group of people from all 
walks of life who support the critical examination of paranormal 
claims 
psychic jeane dixon predicted that president bushs greatest 
challenge would come over the summer when he would be forced to 
make life anddeath decisions about troubles in latin america and 
china 
while those regions were relatively quiet over the summer 
dixon somehow failed to foresee bush having trouble with iraq 
the skeptics said 
in a supermarket tabloid in july irene hughes predicted 
jacqueline onassis would marry bon jovi and bryant gumbel would be 
fired from the today show after a barroom brawl 
in the same article marie graciette of los angeles said the 
largest earthquake on record would hit the sea bed near new york 
city producing a tidal wave that would flood manhattan 
shes also the psychic who predicted the meteorite in the rose 
garden and the cure for the common cold 
not one prediction which was both specific and surprising came 
true the skeptics scoffed

a rare alignment of the sun moon and earth 
will produce higher and lower tides than usual from sunday through 
wednesday raising the chances of coastal flooding government 
forecasters said thursday 
it will be the second round this month of unusual tides a 
similar astronomical arrangement dec 1 through dec 4 caused 
local flooding on the coast of the gulf of maine 
forecasters from the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration said thursday they expect the turnoftheyear tides 
to be more pronounced on the west coast than the east coast 
the weather service forecast no major storms on either coast 
but onshore winds are possible on the new england coast on tuesday 
and the midatlantic coast tuesday and wednesday 
the extra tidal displacement should amount to less than a foot 
higher at high tide or lower at low tide the forecasts said but 
that could be enough to make a difference in some places 
heavy rain snow or onshore winds could bring localized 
flooding noaa said extremely low tides could expose mariners to 
lowwater hazards but could reduce the threat of flooding during a 
storm 
people living and working in coastal areas were urged to consult 
tide tables and to be alert to weather forecasts 
the positions of the sun moon and earth which produce the 
unusual tides occur about once a year like so 
sunday tropic tides where the moon is at its maximum northern 
point above the equator during its monthly trip around the earth 
monday a full moon or syzygy condition in which the moon is 
on the opposite side of the earth from the sun 
monday perigee where the moon is closer to the earth than at 
any other time in its monthly path 
wednesday perihelion where the earth is closer to the sun 
than at any other time of the year 
in addition on dec 22 the sun passed the winter solstice its 
maximum point south of the equator during the year

divorce drugs and child abuse are 
taking a toll on the american family but a national essay contest 
asking children to define kinship showed they still believe family 
values are important 
a family is like a stack of bricks one depends on each other 
and that main brick is love wrote one of about 1800 children 
who submitted entries 
a family is like a field of mice they stick together they 
dont wander alone wrote another child 
the winner of the contest for fifthgraders in 43 states was 
courtney whetstine of mount shasta calif she wrote about her 
parents divorce when she was 4 
i was ready for the worst but it worked out better than i 
thought it would wrote courtney who is 10 
she said she appreciated her parents efforts not to fight in 
front of their children and their friendly relations after the 
divorce 
a recurring theme in the entries was that love was more 
important than legal ties 
the springfieldbased mass mutual life insurance co sponsored 
the contest through its american family values program the winner 
was announced earlier this month 
the contest was advertised through scholastic magazine a 
publication for children entries ranged from the brightest and 
most articulate to those who spoke from the heart said eva dion 
the projects director 
entries were mainly from middleclass students including some 
who wrote as part of class projects said dr albert solnit senior 
research scientist with the yale child study center and a contest 
judge 
its important for people to realize that this was not an 
effort to create an epidemiological sample it was an effort to get 
an articulate sample of what we might call the ideals in practice 
in the united states solnit said 
in many cases students wrote to impress judges with the warmth 
of their families solnit said the essays of about 170 finalists 
showed how families handled adversity 
a panel of judges winnowed the finalists for solnits review 
ms dion said 
we really were looking for something that we felt got to the 
heart of what they considered a family she said 
sticking together seemed to be true measure of family for many 
contestants 
where do you go when your heart is broken queried a 
portland ore girl the family doctor your mother father

about 2000 soviet jews are arriving in israel 
daily setting a record pace that could push the number of 
immigrants from all countries to more than 200000 this year

on thursday 2000 soviet jewish immigrants poured into israel 
surpassing last weekends high rate of 1500 a day said yehuda 
weinrab a spokesman for the quasigovernmental jewish agency the

israeli officials have attributed the surge this month to 
increasing uncertainty about the political climate in the soviet 
union and better israelisponsored transportation arrangements 
israel army radio said the latest surge likely would push the 
overall december immigration total to 35000 and the yearend 
figure to 205000 the totals include ethiopians and other 
nationals but soviets make up about 90 percent 
about 1 million soviets are expected by the end of 1992 while

states have spent only about twothirds of the 
antidrug money provided by the federal government in the past four 
years according to figures released thursday by the office of 
national drug control policy 
of the 50 billion given out through three major block grant 
programs from the first quarter of 1987 through the third quarter 
of 1990 only 34 billion or 68 percent has been distributed by 
state and territorial governments to antidrug programs the 
figures show 
even topranked arizona had spent only 834 percent of the 777 
million it had received ranked second was nevada which had spent 
79 percent of 267 million followed by the us territories 
which had spent 77 percent of the 633 million they received 
coming in last was puerto rico which had spent only 342 
percent of the 317 million it had received next was hawaii 
spending 52 percent of 274 million and wyoming spending 55 
percent of 141 million 
i think whats bringing the spending level down is the law 
enforcement grant because there were such enormous increases in 
that in the last two years said bruce carnes director of 
planning budget and administration for the drug control policy 
office 
justice department antidrug block grants jumped from 119 
million in fiscal year 1989 to 395 million last year they rise to 
423 million this year 
some states have gone ahead and spent it pretty aggressively 
some havent he said 
grants distributed by health and human services for drug 
treatment and prevention are being spent at a much higher level 
82 percent than those for education 46 percent and law 
enforcement 40 percent carnes said 
carnes said of the overall spending level obviously id like 
to see it higher but im not prepared to say theyre not doing 
their jobs 
however he added states that have low spendout rates it 
would be desirable for them to step sharply on this 
hawaiis attorney general warren price said his states fiscal 
procedures made the spending percentage misleadingly low eighty 
percent of the money is used by county prosecutors and police 
departments but those agencies do not spend the federal dollars 
directly they spend their own funds and later claim reimbursement 
from the federal money which makes it seem as if the federal 
dollars are not being spent quickly price said 
though states and territorial governments have not distributed 
as much of the grant money as the drug control policy office would 
like a report issued by the drug policy office thursday said 
giving the grants directly to cities would unnecessarily delay 
delivery of the money to those who need it 
the sum involved is substantial 14 billion in the current 
fiscal year provided under three programs run by the departments 
of justice health and human services and education these grants 
go to the states for disbursement other federal antidrug grants 
bring the total to 26 billion this year or onefourth of the 
total budget for the war against drugs 
the report said the time it takes the federal government to 
distribute the money to the states has been reduced in the past few 
years for example the federal governments review process dropped 
from 46 days last year to 28 days this year 
but cities complain theyre not getting what they need to combat 
the severe drug problems they face and they have argued for direct 
federal funding to local governments 
the report however said that trying to speed up the process by 
having direct federal funding of city programs would put a 
tremendous burden on the federal government which would have to 
review thousands of applications from local governments this would 
sow the process considerably the report said 
patrick v murphy former new york city police commissioner who 
now directs the us conference of mayors police policy board 
argued that the time lag isnt the point 
the mayors feel that although the drug problem is being driven 
by recreational users and many of them are in the suburbs the 
worst problems the murder and violence among the kids who get 
into the traffic and the delays for treatment for lowincome people 
who dont have health insurance are in the cities murphy said 
the drug control offices report acknowledges such criticisms 
but asserts states are closer to the problem than federal 
administrators and can more quickly react to changes in local 
requirements 
rep charles rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics said the administration can claim credit 
if it wants to for quickly dispatching these billions of dollars to 
the states but the fact is they are not reaching the right 
people

the pentagon plans to begin vaccinating us 
troops in the persian gulf against possible germ warfare according 
to a published report 
the new york times reported in its friday editions that senior 
administration officials have recommended proceeding with the 
inoculation program the plan is part of an effort to protect 
military personnel from biological weapons including the use of 
masks and other protective garments 
iraqi president saddam hussein has repeatedly denied having 
biological weapons although iraq used chemical weapons against some 
rebellious kurds in its own country and against iran during its war 
with that country 
army lt col steve roy a spokesman for the department of 
defense declined comment thursday night about the report of 
inoculations of desert shield troops 
we wouldnt comment on anything that might be an operational 
matter he said 
administration officials told the times the plan was prompted by 
cia reports that iraq had stockpiled chemical and biological 
weapons 
the times said it was unclear how many troops might be 
vaccinated but said officials believe it will be those americans 
who are most likely to be threatened by biological weapons such as 
anthrax 
unlike chemical weapons biological weapons are based on living 
agents like viruses and bacteria they can be used to spread 
diseases like typhoid cholera and bacteria 
the times said the inoculations could begin in a matter of 
weeks

the makers of three denture adhesives 
recalled the products thursday because traces of cancercausing 
benzene were detected authorities said 
the adhesives are orafix special brace and cushion grip 
richard kessel chairman of the state consumer protection board 
said the agency found benzene in the adhesives after receiving a 
tip from someone in the industry 
the adhesives pose no immediate health threat and the food and 
drug administration is testing all denture adhesives as a 
precaution kessel said 
the fda encouraged consumers to stop using the three products 
that were voluntarily recalled nationwide 
while this is not believed to be an acute health hazard it 
could pose a danger to denture adhesive users over many years the 
fda and state agree kessel said 
tests of orafix special showed it contained 191 parts of benzene 
per million the fda said in a statement brace contained 190 ppm 
and cushion grip contained 65 ppm 
benzene a naturally occurring chemical used in solvents was 
also detected in fasteeth at 29 parts per billion and fixodent at 
12 ppb 
these benzene levels although detectable in the laboratory 
are considered by the agency to present a negligible risk the 
fda said 
fda officials consider any benzene exposure above 5 ppb to have 
possible adverse health effects 
no benzene was found in five other denture adhesives super poli 
grip orafix original effergrip cvs and confident 
smithkline beecham consumer brands of pittsburgh pa recalled 
orafix special and brace cushion grip was recalled by plough inc

the nation grew to 2496 million people in the 
1980s as more americans left the industrial and agricultural 
heartlands for the south and west 
the census bureaus first final figures from the 1990 
census released wednesday showed the pull of the sun belt 
remained strong despite efforts by the industrial north to promote 
growth and the collapse during the 1980s of the oil and savings and 
loan industries two mainstays of the southern and western states 
the census figures are used to adjust the number of 
representatives each state sends to congress so that political 
clout is in line with population the figures also determine the 
division of federal money among states and localities 
the numbers could change next summer when the commerce 
department decides whether to adjust the count some states and 
cities are likely to challenge the tallies whichever way the 
adjustment decision goes

english writer evelyn waugh hated television 
he called it insufferable 
london weekend television adapted waughs classic novel 
scoop for the small screen british tv critics called it 
disappointing 
if youre a british journalist theres plenty to be 
disappointed about in this 1937 book that pillories the boozing 
lying and lazy meanderings of his majestys supposedly noble and 
learned overseas press corps 
but if youre not a british reporter or if you actually know a 
foreign correspondent scoop is hilarious and right on the 
mark 
americans will have a chance to see it sunday on pbs 
masterpiece theater the 20yearold epitome of good taste 
hosted by alistair cooke 
this version made three years ago by london weekend television 
was roundly criticized when shown on british television for leaving 
out some of the books more biting anecdotes 
the twohour movie is a little long on spectacle having been 
filmed in london and morocco and populated by long wide sets 
boasting staircases that rival the tower of babel 
it is however far from shallow waughs humor stings like gin 
poured over a paper cut in keeping with that the british 
television movie is true not only to the books details but to its 
tone as well 
it stars donald pleasence as lord copper the megalomaniac 
publisher of the beast owned by megapolitan newspaper corp 
denholm elliott as salter his fawning felicitous foreign editor 
and michael maloney as william boot the dimwitted garden columnist 
whose prose is so dense only a hand grenade can dislodge its 
cumbersome sentences 
how boot is sent overseas as a foreign correspondent is such a 
ridiculous instance of mistaken identity it qualifies as a marx 
brothers routine trouble is in the time in which scoop is 
set such absurdities were only too possible 
written more than 50 years ago waughs story skewers fleet 
streets popular press and its warring newspaper correspondents who 
invented quotes and even entire battles to titillate readers and 
tweak competitors 
waugh knew of which he wrote in 1935 as a correspondent for 
londons daily mail he covered benito mussolinis war with 
abyssinia now ethiopia waughs journalistic credentials for this 
foreign posting he had previously visited abyssinia 
in scoop boot is sent by the beast to the makebelieve 
african country of ishmaelia where war has broken out boot 
arrives collapsible canoe and full christmas dinner in hand to 
find a horde of tightknit whiskeyfilled correspondents no one 
however can find the war 
they dont call it pack journalism for nothing 
former waugh colleagues have recently written that scoops 
portrayals are infinitely closer to fact than fiction 
during the abyssinian war one british journalist came equipped 
with a camel when his paper questioned the purchase submitted on 
his expense account the intrepid correspondent cabled back glad 
you reminded me cremation of one camel 10 pounds 
waugh himself despite his sense of humor and the absurd was 
anything but a happy soul he abhorred television and driving he 
loved to drink shortly before his death in 1966 at age 62 he 
described his daily routine thusly 
i get up late i try to read my letters i try to read the 
paper i have some gin i try to read the paper again i have some 
more gin 
he hung out with oxford grads in a mens club that included 
graham greene anthony powell cyril connolly harold acton and 
john betjeman 
masterpiece theater has had good luck with waughs works 
its adaptation of waughs brideshead revisted was a programming 
milestone 
scoop despite bad reviews from its british debut is well 
worth the attention of american viewers if for no other reason 
than its delivery of things not frequently seen on the us telly 
very witty dialogue and a script that provokes thought 
 
elsewhere in television 
doogie has a conscience abcs doogie howser md that 
totally realistic comedy about a 16yearold doctor is canning the

cameron mackintosh britains leading producer of 
the megamusical has an unexpected hit in a smallscale production 
that leaves its audience shouting for moe 
its a marvelous accident the pieces fell in together 
mackintosh said of five guys named moe the musical revue of 
american jazzman louis jordan opened dec 14 at the lyric theater 
its west end arrival follows a sellout run at the fringe 
theater royal stratford east in east london mackintosh saw the 
show there in october and decided during the intermission to fund a 
commercial transfer 
i literally went for a fun night out at the theater i was 
bowled over the producer recalled in an interview before 
hopping a plane to madrid to tend to that citys staging of les 
miserables 
the most successful producer in the theater today the 
44yearold mackintosh has cats les miserables and the 
phantom of the opera running in london on broadway and around 
the world his current london smash miss saigon opens april 11 
in new york where the advance sale exceeds 31 million 
five guys named moe has a budget of about 770000 less 
than two weeks running costs for phantom of the opera on 
broadway 
in the end i never get hooked on scale mackintosh said 
i do a show because i like it 
others like it too kate kellaway in the observer said this 
tremendous show comes closer to a party than anything i have seen 
on stage before if attendance continues at present capacity 
levels the show will recoup in 1012 weeks mackintosh said 
the show pays exuberant tribute to jordan the alto saxophonist 
who died in 1975 at the age of 66 its two hours of calypso swing 
and bebop embrace such songs as there aint nobody here but us 
chickens messy bessy saturday night fish fry and the 
title song 
the audience chimes in too joining the cast in a conga line 
and singing to the words push ka pi shi pie eh eh printed on 
pieces of paper which the ushers distribute 
the six singerdancers three britons and three ameicans 
include the musicals creator clarke peters an american based in 
london on and off since 1973 the directorchoreographer is fellow 
american charles augins 
peters has had his share of previous successes starring in the 
london companies of driving miss daisy and august wilsons ma 
raineys black bottom 
the 38yearold peters is reaping the benefits of five years 
work on five guys which began when he was appearing in 
carmen jones in 1985 at the crucible theater in sheffield 
south yorkshire 
we were doing an evening of good company and i had this idea 
of five guys coming out of this guys bed just as he was about to 
crash out after a depressing evening with his lady peter said 
in the current version nomax dig wayne is a depressed radio 
deejay taken by surprise early one morning when five songanddance 
men leap out of his radio to offer advice to the lovelorn of the 
most rollicking and bluesy sort 
mackintosh said the musical found exactly the right weight 
its not a compilation show but its not striving to be a 
biopic 
it treads that line so wonderfully cleverly he said 
five guys named moe is rare for mackintosh in that he tends 
to produce his musicals from scratch spending years getting them 
in shape in november he opened another small musical just 
so at northwest londons tricycle theater where it runs through 
jan 12 
has five guys put him in the market for other shows once 
miss saigon is up and running on broadway 
absolutely not mackintosh said look this is a very 
extraordinary circumstance this sort of show doesnt happen very 
often 
and what about the future of five guys 
i think this is a broadway show myself he said it will 
be a nice problem to worry about whilst im hopefully in new york 
with saigon

the wave of religious freedom sweeping over 
eastern europe and the efforts of western religious groups to bring 
the church in from the cold was the top religion news story of 
1990 according to a poll 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev who won the 1990 nobel peace 
prize for his role in introducing democratic changes in eastern 
europe and easing eastwest conflicts also was selected as 
religion newsmaker of the year for the second year in a row in the 
voting by 45 members of the religion newswriters association 
evangelist billy graham finished second 
in the soviet union official tolerance for religion has 
increased greatly since gorbachev came to power in 1985 in the 
last two years many churches have been reconsecrated and soviet 
citizens have flocked to services in record numbers 
the soviet legislature this fall approved a freedom of 
conscience bill promised by gorbachev when he met with pope john 
paul ii at the vatican last december the law forbids the 
government from interfering in the practice of religion formally 
ending decades of repression 
with the door to evangelism opened many western churches are 
sponsoring missionary efforts in eastern europe bringing in 
teachers preachers equipment building funds and bibles 
organizations from the united methodist church to the southern 
baptist convention have planned projects in eastern europe 
us roman catholic bishops have established a special committee 
on ways to aid eastern europe and jewish groups concerned about 
the dangers of a renewal of antisemitism have jumped in to help 
longdormant churches realize the fruits of decades of ecumenical 
advances in the west 
sex scandals took second place in the poll roman catholic 
archbishop eugene a marino resigned july 10 after revelations of 
an intimate relationship with a young woman and the rev allen 
boesak resigned aug 10 as president of the world alliance of 
reformed churches after admitting an extramarital affair with a 
married television producer the rev bruce ritter left the 
covenant house organization he founded amid accusations by male 
youths of sexual affairs he has denied wrongdoing 
the continuing conflict in the nations largest protestant 
denomination the southern baptist convention ranked third 
conservatives elected a fundamentalist to the presidency and fired 
the two top editors of the denominations press service and 
moderates withheld some funds from convention agencies 
in fourth place was the suspension of two lutheran congregations 
in san francisco by the evangelical lutheran church in america for 
ordaining and installing acknowledged homosexuals presiding 
episcopal bishop edmond l browning reprimanded bishop john spong 
of newark nj for ordaining a declared homosexual the rev 
robert williams spong later suspended williams for making public 
remarks disparaging monogamy and the celibacy of mother teresa 
a historic conference of south african black and white churches 
condemning the policy of racial separation known as apartheid 
ranked fifth antiapartheid leader nelson mandela released from 
prison feb 11 received financial and moral support from us 
religious leaders on a summer tour 
a supreme court ruling upholding the denial of unemployment 
benefits to two drug counselors fired for using peyote an illegal 
hallucinogenic drug in an american indian religious ceremony 
ranked sixth religious leaders expressed concern the ruling 
overturned past precedent that the governent must show a 
compelling state interest to force compliance with a law that 
conflicts with a religious practice 
in seventh place was the efforts of us religious leaders to 
urge nonmilitary solutions to the persian gulf crisis the 
national council of churches has urged the administration to halt 
its military buildup in the persian gulf and begin withdrawing 
troops and the national conference of catholic bishops has 
repeatedly expressed reservations about the possibility of a us 
offensive 
the assassination of rabbi meir kahane an antiarab militant 
ranked eighth many considered kahane a bigot and a demagogue for 
calling arabs dogs and advocating their expulsion from israel but 
some considered him a freedom fighter determined to avoid another 
holocaust 
in ninth place were catholic guidelines on theologians and 
churchaffiliated universities the congregation for the doctrine 
of the faith ordered theologians to refrain from publicly 
challenging church teaching and pope john paul instructed catholic 
universities to uphold official doctrine but rejected a proposal to 
give bishops wide powers over the schools 
the decision by us catholic bishops to hire a public relations 
firm to oppose abortion rounded out the top 10 some groups 
favoring legalized abortion criticized the decision as being 
politically motivated and a waste of money but church leaders 
defended the decision 
we believe that the most critical issue in the united states 
is the problem of abortion and if we believe that then we should 
try to use the best possible means to communicate cardinal john 
j oconnor of new york said

either peace or stability in the middle east is laid almost

in its early years it was robust but by the 
mid1980s it was bogging down in excesses and inconsistencies and 
for the past few years it has just been stumbling along 
now it is over the great economic expansion that began in the 
fall of 1982 the longest since the end of world war ii and by 
some measures the mightiest ever generated 
there are those who disagree about that of course and they 
have good reasons federal budget deficits are uncontrolled debt 
much of it never to be repaid permeates and undermines the 
foundation 
those weaknesses are obvious less evident are defects that 
emerge only after scrutiny such as that real earnings of workers 
in the nonfarm economy have declined for most of the past 20 
years its seldom referred to 
perhaps the most fundamental defects of all the violations of 
old standards and the corruption of values rate very little 
attention but they are there right at the base of most of the 
problems 
volumes are written about fixing up the system but will it do 
much good if the same wild breaches of business decorum erupt 
again such as 
socalled victimless whitecollar securities crimes one 
defense of convicted inside traders stock manipulators and other 
securities law violators of the 1980s is that their crimes caused 
no deaths maybe not but they caused lost jobs and distressed 
companies 
bankers who made loans of other peoples money to borrowers 
they knew were reckless and undeserving they placed billions of 
dollars at risk sometimes while turning down more deserving more 
productive corporate citizens 
those were socalled business decisions and so long as the 
letter of the law if not its spirit was observed nobody will go 
to jail some perpetrators will escape without even a tarnished 
reputation some might get bonuses 
members of corporate boards of directors who didnt do their 
jobs the directors job is to protect interests of the 
shareholders to be their agent and to see that the company is 
properly run in their interest 
clearly hundreds of boards failed in this reponsibility some 
directors didnt know what was going on some didnt care and 
judging by events some appear to have acquiesced in activities 
they should have prevented 
one of the most common violations of trust involved repeated 
raises to managers who failed to handle their duties properly some 
directors for example agreed to bonuses for inferior performance 
executives who lived off their companies rather than 
contributed to them seemingly more interested in perks than 
profits 
the departure from old standards that caused people we like to 
consider most astute to make the most stupendous blunders who made 
those blunders bankers brokers attorneys accountants members 
of congress 
the congress which repeatedly told america it was cutting 
spending but which raised spending and deficits to levels that a 
decade ago would have been incomprehensible by quietly seeking and 
getting funds for pet projects 
the list could go on almost anyone can make a different one 
but they can demonstrate the same point yes there was an erosion 
of standards and values during the great expansion of the past 
eight years and it too has to be fixed

for stan edmister bridges are a canvas where 
an engineer sees a mass of concrete and steel he sees a potential 
masterpiece 
if paint is going to be put on a bridge to sustain its life 
why should it be brown or gray or pastel green when it could be a 
lively combination of colors says the 51yearold artist 
two years ago edmister won a 10000 grant from the national 
endowment for the arts to design a color scheme for the guilford 
avenue bridge in baltimore the result was so pleasing one nea 
official said that edmister was awarded a second 10000 grant to 
select colors for 15 other bridges that cross interstate 83 
as the bridges are rehabilitated they will be painted according 
to edmisters design 
jeff soule special project manager at the nea in washington 
said the award committee hopes edmisters work will spur other 
cities to treat their public works as art 
we felt it would be a national model in improving the 
appearance of ordinary structural elements in the urban 
environment it is a very very pragmatic application of art it 
elevates public works and at the same time it makes art 
accessible soule said 
hes uncomfortable with muted hues that allow behemoths to 
settle anonymously into the background so he experiments with 
vibrant greens yellows oranges and foil appliques that change 
color 
he selects colors to highlight the design of a bridge and its 
setting he says 
he wants to treat the bridges over interstate 83 as a continuum 
related yet each with its own temperament 
driving under and through the city there is a series of 
tunnel arches or bridge covers that sets up a natural rhythm there 
should be some sort of color theme uniting them but there should 
not be a bland blanket similarity from one to another he said 
the arches of the guilford avenue bridge are bright green gray 
and henna vertical yellow bands link arch to deck girders on the 
underside are green and yellow iridescent green stripes along the 
bridges gray fence appear to change color when the sun strikes 
them 
the painting was part of a 38 million bridge rehabilitation 
city officials say they dont know whether the special treatment 
cost more than if a single color had been used harry mccullough 
chief of baltimores interstate bridge division said the city 
sought just one contract and didnt seek a comparison bid 
the cost of cleaning and painting the bridge was 137000 well 
below the engineers estimate of 210000 he said 
the federal government provided 85 percent of the rehabilitation 
money porter barrows division administrator of the federal 
highway administration in maryland said the government allowed the 
special painting after determining the additional cost would be 
minimal 
i dont want to say that the cost isnt important because it 
is he said but we felt the proposal was legitimate and 
interesting it resulted in some interesting comments i think 
the federal government must approve edmisters colors which 
include the vibrant green used for road signs and the bright yellow 
used for center lines foils must be used in moderation the 
government toned down edmisters initial idea for the guilford 
avenue bridge fearing it would be too distracting to motorists 
not everyone approves of his concepts edmister said although 
the guilford bridge has converted some skeptics 
i remember a few engineers who said they disliked an artist 
tampering in their arena and certainly didnt like a carnivallike 
color scheme being used he said now that the bridge is done 
and the newness is starting to settle in or the familiarity is 
becoming apparent these same engineers are accepting it

joan kenley sometimes talks to herself 
but thats understandable after all millions of people listen to 
her 
among other things kenley is the ubiquitous voice of voice 
mail pacific bells computerized answering service that more 
businesses are turning to instead of human operators 
she might also tell you how much to drop in a pay phone 
when you pick up the phone at a hotel kenley could be on the 
other end shes the voice of guest messenger a sheraton hotel 
chain service similar to voice mail or you might hear her rattling 
off the prices at computerized grocery store checkout counters 
i guess i have made hundreds of thousands of them said 
kenley whose voice is becoming familiar to even more people 
pacbell in october brought the voice mail service to home phones 
under the name the message center 
im even the englishspeaking voice on pay phones in japan 
said kenley who is also the voice on software designer northern 
telecoms meridian mail and the interstate long distance voice for 
several companies including michigan and ohio bell 
i think people who work with my voice would be sick of it but 
they actually love it said kenley who lives in oakland 
one reason her voice is so popular is that the melody tends 
not to go away and so allows sound technicians to mix old tapes 
with new ones kenley said in an interview 
if there is a criticism of her voice its that its too 
real 
people can easily start talking to it but thats a compliment 
as well 
she even does it herself 
kenley said she was checking into a hotel recently and when i 
picked up the house phone i ended up talking to myself its kind 
of spooky 
kenley has done pricevoicing for 50 grocery store chains the 
automated service sounds out the cost of an item when it is passed 
over the checkout machine 
my uncle in cleveland was leaving a checkout where i say 
thank you and he answered youre welcome joan she said 
kenleys career includes voice coaching and acting with guest 
parts in shows that have ranged from the honeymooners to a 
revival of call me madam with ethel merman 
she is also a voiceover artist who has narrated ads for several 
leading corporations including cocacola co and general motors 
corps chevrolet division 
but dont get the idea that kenley is just another pretty voice 
she earned a phd in psychology and is the author of voice 
power an 1895 hardcover described by the publisher aslan 
publishing of boulder creek calif as a breakthrough method to 
enhance your speaking voice 
kenley said her big break came 10 years ago when she was 
contacted by university of california professor forrest mozer who 
developed a way to put the human voice on a computer chip mozer 
felt the best way for humans to interface with computers would 
be vocally 
he said he wanted a voice that was warm but not too sexy 
kenley recalled now my voice is everywhere elevators 
airplanes even talking alarm clocks 
national semiconductor corp a computer electronics company 
that pioneered the talking checkout counter had high standards for 
its device 
they wanted a voice that wasnt too perky or too saccharine or 
too monotonous kenley said they didnt want a voice that was 
threatening or that clerks would go crazy listening to 
kenley says her work is a kind of immortality 
a hundred years from now ill be long gone but my voice will 
still be going out into the stratosphere saying two dollars and 
fifty cents please 
end adv for sunday dec 31

for the new congress convening on thursday 
the questions of peace and war are waiting with added urgency as 
the days dwindle toward the jan 15 for iraqi withdrawal from 
kuwait 
five months of intermittent debate and a dozen house and senate 
hearings have produced no answers and scant guidance to define the 
role of the democratic congress in a crisis under republican 
management 
at this point its a crisis on hold for the holidays 
at a quiet capitol recorded telephone messages report some 
offices closed until after the new year president bush is at camp 
david md on an 11day break 
theres little traffic and less tension in the capital even as 
reinforcements are deployed in the persian gulf and the saudi 
arabian desert building to the troop strength that could deliver 
on the us threat to take the offensive after midjanuary thats 
when the united nations has authorized the use of force if 
necessary 
according to the democratic leaders of congress us forces 
cannot be sent to fight without congressional approval according 
to the republican administration bush already has all the 
authority he needs to act 
that debate will resume when congress does it wont be 
conclusive the answer has been elusive for two centuries under a 
constitutional system that makes the president the commander in 
chief and empowers only congress to declare war 
there were demands during the fall that congress be summoned 
back to declare war there were calls for a resolution of approval 
for bushs policy of threatening military action against iraqi 
occupation of kuwait there were proposals to invoke the creaky 
machinery of the war powers system under which a president cant 
send troops into danger unless congress approves 
none of that happened and none of it is likely to happen now 
but in one form or another the 102nd congress is going to have 
to come to clear majority decisions on the persian gulf possibly 
but not necessarily on direct questions of policy certainly on the 
money and manpower to back up that policy 
the administration will need a supplemental appropriation of up 
to 20 billion early this year to finance operation desert shield 
callup authority for some support units summoned to active duty 
will begin expiring in march unless congress extends it or bush 
declares a national emergency 
and there may have to be action later in the year to change the 
timetable for cutbacks that are supposed to reduce active duty 
military forces by at least 80000 before next sept 30 
an attempt to write a policy resolution and get it through house 
and senate would be risky for both congress and the white house 
bush has been quoted as telling members of congress that he would 
welcome a resolution of support along the lines of the united 
nations resolution authorizing force after jan 15 but if youre 
going to debate this for months and not reach a conclusion and 
argue about it then that may not be helpful 
resolutions endorsing his policy were adopted by overwhelming 
votes in the house and senate early in october backing continued 
action by the president to deter iraqi aggression and protect 
american lives and vital interests but the authors of those 
measures said they covered only what had been done to that point 
and did not authorize the use of force 
when those measures passed the strategy for forcing iraqs 
withdrawal from kuwait was built around economic sanctions against 
iraq with the united states assigned to defend saudi arabia 
against any attack by saddam husseins forces 
on nov 8 bush ordered us forces doubled to create the 
capability and raise the possibility of military action to retake 
kuwait democratic leaders were told of the decision shortly before 
bush announced it and support that had been almost unanimous began 
to fray with democrats urging patience to give economic sanctions 
more time to work 
but democrats cant risk becoming the party of dissent while 
american forces are at risk that could weaken the us position in 
the current confrontation at a time when bush says the best way to 
avoid war is to convince saddam hussein that he faces war unless he 
relents and it could do them lasting political damage vice 
president dan quayle produced a preview of a republican 
counterattack saying earlier this month that patience at any 
price would amount to appeasement of saddam hussein 
as the debate resumes sen george j mitchell dmaine the 
majority leader says whatever the differences on timing and 
tactics the united states is united on the goal of getting iraq 
out of kuwait 
the question is how

in a sunlit new england meadow kolya 
stretches out among his sheep for a snooze 
even in dozy repose he investigates anyone approaching the 
flock 
and when eyes meet there is little doubt whos in charge its 
the shar planinetz a huge lionlike dog with majestic blue mane 
bred to protect the flocks in the mountains of yugoslavia from 
wolves 
kolya is one of the first of the breed to be used successfully 
against coyotes by a pair of hampshire college biologists 
nearly 15 years after ray and lorna coppinger began 
experimenting with rare breeds from remote corners of europe 
thousands of the big dogs are watching over flocks in the american 
west 
and like good shepherds the coppingers are keeping an eye on 
the big deceptively placid breeds 
they are still the best nonlethal method weve got to protect 
sheep against coyotes and other predators on the open range 
coppinger said 
we thought wed place out and follow 100 dogs and that would 
be the end of the research but were up to 1221 now and still at 
it mrs coppinger said the sheep producers wouldnt let us 
stop 
she estimates that with offspring of dogs and the work of other 
groups there are 4000 to 5000 guard dogs protecting flocks 
they are an answer to all of us said sandy petersen a 
rancher in sidney mont who leaves her two guard dogs alone with 
her flock of 350 purebred sheep they eat a lot but its nothing 
compared to the cost of losing the lambs to coyotes and you dont 
have to get involved in poison they keep us in business 
initially skeptical the us department of agriculture is now 
promoting sheepguarding dogs with pamphlets and videos 
in some areas of the west the dogs have significantly changed 
the way ranchers manage flocks said tom macdonald of the american 
sheep producers association they are particularly effective on 
desert range where a pair of dogs can protect 1000 ewes he said 
some colorado ranchers have told the association their losses 
have been cut from 450 sheep a year to a dozen or so 
and not just from coyotes 
at the coppingers farm recently a student was training a pair 
of beguiling white maremma pups headed for the area around 
yellowstone park where ranchers are nervous about plans to 
reintroduce wolves 
in a test in minnesota a single dog kept a small wolf pack from 
a bait station for 30 nights until the wolves finally combined 
forces to drive off the dog coppinger said 
we put him back the next night with a second dog and it went 
back to a standoff he said despite nightly confrontations the 
two dogs deterred the wolves until the experiment was ended 30 
nights later 
typically the dogs chase away rather than kill 
one of the primary aims of any predator is to keep itself 
healthy because it cant hunt for food when its hurt so they 
will back off in the face of the threat of likely harm mrs 
coppinger said 
supported by a newly created association of guard dog users 
mrs coppinger is compiling a computerized registry of dogs on 
american farms and ranches their working characteristics and blood 
lines 
although some crossbreeds have been successful and the tibetan 
mastiff also is used most of the sheepguarding dogs in the united 
states are european breeds 
some such as the great pyrenees from the mountains along the 
frenchspanish border and the komondor and kuvasz from hungary had 
also become popular as pets but others the anatolian shepherd 
the akbash dog from turkey the maremma from italy the shar 
planinetz of yugoslavia and the polish tatra were little known 
outside the sheepraising areas of the old world 
the only american entry is a smaller strain developed by the 
navahos in arizona to defend flocks against coyotes mrs coppinger 
said 
little research had been done linking dogs personality traits 
to genetics when the coppingers first began their studies in the 
1970s 
they found that through years of breeding the guard dogs 
psychological development had been arrested in the beguiling stage 
f puppyhood when little animals affectionately lick and touch 
their litter mates they stay close to the nest and are suspicious 
of anything new reacting to an intrusion with a panicked bark or 
snap 
the dogs also lack good species recognition patterns and when 
raised with sheep or other animals are unclear about who or what 
is and isnt a dog coppinger said they may think of sheep as 
dogs or llamas as dogs or people as dogs 
so a shar planinetz will lie down peacefully with its lambs but 
will stand menacingly between its flock and danger 
they seem to be able to set up limits and lines that are not 
to be crossed mrs coppinger said and once they have bonded 
with the sheep thats really the only training they need to guard 
 
roger woodruff a researcher at the university of oregon and 
jeffrey green of the university of idaho also began importing guard 
dogs in the 1970s in a separate program woodruff now with the 
usda said their basic behavioral findings were similar 
we were more oriented to immediate application and let it go 
after placing 60 dogs he said the coppingers have done a lot 
of real indepth behavioral and basic scientific research 
the dogs only watch and protect they wont herd sheep 
they dont see sheep as prey as a border collie does but as 
another dog coppinger said you cant even get them to chase a 
ball its just not in their makeup

physicians and scientists who consult 
sports groups on steroid use say a new male contraceptive opens the 
door to abuse by young athletes 
a study done for the world health organization said weekly 
injections of 200 milligrams of testosterone enanthate were a 
safe stable effective and reversible contraceptive 
administered to males 
but testosterone enanthate is an anabolic steroid banned by the 
governing bodies of most sports the hormone adds muscle mass and 
strength to those who use it 
twohundred milligrams will make me bigger and it will make 
any man bigger said charles yesalis a consultant to the ncaa 
high schools and the national football league players association 
i can see guys saying you dont need to take the pill 
honey ill gladly take these shots yesalis said 
a seattle researcher who directed a part of the who study said 
the dosage to induce infertility is too low to cause any problems 
but conceded that many of the 157 men who completed the study 
reported weight gain 
some men who had been chronically underweight gained and they 
liked that it was muscle it wasnt flabby fat said dr c 
alvin paulsen of the university of washington medical center 
yesalis and steve courson who played for the pittsburgh 
steelers and tampa bay buccaneers of the national football league 
fear athletes will arrange to receive shots from several doctors a 
week 
for many athletes their sports are just as important as 
contraception said yesalis a health and human development 
professor at penn state university who in the 1980s studied steroid 
use among high school athletes 
courson who started out using 35 milligrams of steroids a week 
and once was up to 1300 milligrams weekly said you can get 
mighty big on 200 millgrams it can be used as a performance 
enducer at that level 
and if an athlete begins using steroids at too young an age his 
muscles can outgrow his stillgrowing bones courson said 
kids aspire to be what the superstars are so they try to use 
the drugs they perceive the athletes are using he said 
courson was interviewed from a pittsburgh hospital awaiting a 
heart transplant for a degenerative heart disease he said his 
doctors arent sure whether his heavy steroid use contributed to 
his health problems 
testosterone occurs naturally but is on the ncaas list of 
banned substances with other anabolic or strengthenducing 
steroids players can lose eligibility if levels of the hormone are 
six times the level of epitestosterone 
steroid use also is banned by the international olympic 
committee and state and local high school sports federations 
it opens the door to abuse because testosterone is the 
granddaddy of all the anabolic steroids said dr richard 
strauss a professor of medicine at ohio state university and 
editor of the monthly journal physician and sportsmedicine 
the who study was reported in a recent issue of the medical 
journal lancet in london the study said men had to be injected for 
an average of four months before enough hormone built up in their 
bodies to stop sperm production of the 157 men tested only one 
fathered a child 
after the injections were stopped normal sperm production 
resumed in an average of 67 months the report said 
if the male contraceptive comes into wide use and strauss and 
paulsen think it will sports agencies either will have to change 
their rules to allow its use by athletes or tell athletes to use 
other methods while in competition 
in the past some asthma medications used were actually 
stimulants and athletes made the argument they needed to take 
them strauss said they were told to use other medications 
frank uryasz the director of sports sciences and drug testing 
for the ncaa said there now appears no way around the testosterone 
ban 
to make exceptions in this area would create a tremendous 
loophole he said 
right now there are no legitimate uses uryasz said if 
you have to use them now youre going to be so sick youre not 
going to be competing in intercollegiate athletics

lisa livingston stands over her sons 
crib and strokes his hair as a lullaby plays softly in the 
background its nap time for brett livingston seber 
except the little boy spends his life in a perpetual state of 
half sleep the victim of a disease so rare that doctors knew 
almost nothing about it until a decade ago 
brett was born with 4hydroxybutyric aciduria a hereditary 
disease in which a missing enzyme in the brain causes severe brain 
damage and loss of muscle control 
for reasons that we dont fully understand missing this 
enzyme interferes with normal early brain growth and development 
said dr darryl de vivo chief of pediatric neurology at 
columbiapresbyterian medical center in new york he really is 
kind of in a chronic stage of sleep 
fewer than two dozen children in the world have been diagnosed 
with the disease de vivo said 
brett who just turned 4 has the most severe case of the 
disease ever seen de vivo said 
at an age when he should be running playing and learning new 
words brett lies motionless in a stainless steel crib with a 
feeding tube in his nose roundtheclock nurses monitor his every 
breath he cannot move any part of his body without help except his 
eyelids 
the disease has robbed him of his eyesight although no one 
knows if he is totally blind he has never spoken a word he hasnt 
been outside in more than a year 
his only response to the outside world is the soft humming sound 
he makes when his mother talks to him 
doctors dont know how to treat the disease so few people 
suffer from it that they dont know the longterm prognosis the 
oldest victim is now 6 years old and little research is being 
done 
livingston who is divorced from bretts father recently set 
out to change that in november she established a foundation to 
raise money for research into 4hydroxybutyric aciduria and other 
rare childhood diseases 
her goal is to find a corporate sponsor to donate money for 
research but for now all she has is a post office box and the 
dream of a cure 
i will do anything humanly possible so tat no other child and 
parent have to go through this she said 
livingston spends hours reading singing and talking to brett 
her 6yearold daughter courtney performs plays for her brother 
and scampers back and forth into his room 
to an observer brett seems awake because his eyes are always 
open in fact his brain does not go through all the normal sleep 
cycles and a nurse must give him a sedative so he can rest 
brett was born a seemingly normal child the only hint that 
something was wrong was his inability to crawl but doctors said he 
was just slow to develop because he was a big baby 
when he was 11 months old he slumped over in his high chair and 
fell into a coma 
livingston found topnotch pediatric neurologists at 
columbiapresbyterian there she met de vivo who has since become 
an authority on bretts disease 
the medical bills have been in the hundreds of thousands of 
dollars livingston said she has insurance but that runs out in 
july and she is having trouble finding another carrier 
im totally wiped out said livingston a parttime 
elementary school teacher 
she receives alimony from her former husband and the colleen 
giblin memorial foundation a private charity that provides money 
for research in pediatric neurology also has helped 
livingston kicked off her own fundraising effort at a local 
card and gift store where the manager offered to put a jar on the 
counter to collect money 
within a week more than 350 was deposited in the jar said 
lillian tyska manager of millers hallmark shop in stamford 
one man stood there and cried tyska said and i said 
are you related he said no but this breaks my heart 
 
editors note the address of the brett livingston seber 
foundation is po box 1644 new canaan conn 06840

its tough being a major leaguer what with 
the huge paychecks fans who idolize you and a job that lets you 
do what youve loved since you were a kid 
you dont think thats tough 
then talk with dr herndon p harding jr psychiatrist to the 
los angeles dodgers 
the degree of the pressure they experience is much more 
heightened than for most people said harding who quit as 
director of ohios department of mental health to become the dodger 
organizations first psychiatrist 
not that being a dodger is harmful to your mental health 
harding figures that if you can make it to the pros youve 
probably learned to handle stress fairly well but the way he sees 
it counseling can make you even better 
for instance he said a pitcher may concentrate on i gotta 
throw this fastball instead of im gonna burn this thing down 
the middle 
the gotta is a negative thought that shows fear of failure 
and if you concentrate on failure youll find it harding said 
on the other hand he said the gonna assumes youll like doing 
it and encourages success 
he and other experts say however that their focus is on more 
than improving concentration they say relieving longterm problems 
from on and off the field can free an athlete to play his best 
my role has been a preventative one to see no talents lost 
for psychological reasons said bruce c ogilvie a professor 
emeritus at san jose state university in california and a longtime 
sports psychologist 
there are plenty of chances for talent to be lost those huge 
paychecks for instance can come with a mentalhealth deduction 
said dr richard g rappaport a sports psychiatrist in rancho 
santa fe calif a suburb of san diego 
whos got the biggest income becomes the way they compete 
rappaport said 
and the experts say competing is what athletes may do too much 
of against their own goals or each other nonpros also may carry 
their own excess pressures driving themselves constantly and never 
forgiving failure but the pros do it in the public eye rappaport 
said 
the requirements are so total and absolute said ogilvie 
you really are denied a private existence not permitted to have 
failures as a human being 
a player whos losing playing time finds himself facing one of 
the most traumatic realities he has to confront ogilvie added 
without help the athlete might turn to substance abuse he said 
and if a player succeeds he can get the big head whos ever 
prepared for that sudden rush of exaltation ogilvie asked 
its no wonder that a lot of elite athletes seem to love 
themselves a lot harding said theyve been told how good they are 
since they were kids 
by giving them breaks on everything from homework to chores 
their supporters limit athletes understanding of the real worl 
harding said its not their fault theyve been given this life 
and they dont know anything else 
star athletes also attract women which can mean trouble for 
marriages or as ogilvie put it they have special problems in 
maintaining a primary relationship long repeated road trips 
away from family create a loneliness that can make things worse he 
said 
the pressure can come to bear on performance harding said 
thats the first line of intervention to find out whats 
interfering with the specific performance and then explore what 
kind of things might be occurring outside of playing the game 
longterm treatment might not be needed but rather shortterm 
therapy might do it rappaport said 
a lot of athletes just lack the maturity to figure out where 
their lives are going he said i would try to reorient them to 
look at things in perspective

resolving to go on a diet is probably one of the 
most common resolutions any year but doing it all at once is too 
hard for many people to sustain past the new years day football 
game halftime 
its very difficult particularly if you love good food 
said chef julia child 
but she and a few others who pay close attention to what 
americans eat offered a few specific resolutions to make the task 
easier 
jane brody author of jane brodys good food gourmet 
change one meal a week to be lower in fat higher in fiber 
and richer in the healthpromoting complex carbohydrates like 
potatoes rice pasta and beans 
every other week she suggested change one more meal by the 
end of the year you will have a far more nutritious diet and 
probably have lost a considerable amount of weight 
bonnie liebman nutrition specialist center for science in 
the public interest 
eat red meat no more three times a week 
use 1 percent or skim milk rather than whole milk or 2 
percent milk 
eat five to nine fruits or vegetables a day people have 
heard eat more vegetables since they were 2 it goes in one ear 
and out the other but if people have a number it helps 
julia child 
unfortunately cocktails and wine and liquor add an awful lot 
of empty calories so i think when youre having a sparkling soda 
put in some lime pretend its a cocktail put it in a nice stem 
glass and sit back 
on toast use marmelade instead of butter she said butter has 
about 100 calories per tablespoon around twice that of marmelade 
be conscious of everything you eat she said eat a lot of 
filling things so you feel satisfied 
ruth lahmayer registered dietitian from atlanta and 
spokeswoman for the american dietetic association 
a lot of people cut out starches i would encourage four to 
six starch servings a day even if youre trying to lose weight 
lahmayer said a serving she said is a half bagel a slice of 
bread or a halfcup pasta rice or cereal 
and the good old basic one is be sure to have a good breakfast 
every day consisting of one to two starches one fruit either 
fresh or halfcup of juice and one cup of lowfat yogurt or skim 
or lowfat milk she said 
lahmayer also said to cut meat to two small protein servings a 
day two to three ounces which is about the size of a deck of 
cards or cassette tape case 
katherine eakin editor of cooking light magazine 
dont say im never going to eat a specific food again be 
realistic just say im going to eat less she said if you say 
never youll only want it more 
eat at home more often and cook more if youre trying to eat 
a moderate balanced and varied diet if you have more control you 
have more confidence eakin said 
clark wolf new york restaurant consultant 
i travel a lot and i eat a lot its my job to eat a lot and 
im pushing 40 and am trying to keep in shape wolf said 
my secret weapon is popcorn i buy it in airports i go into 
movie theaters and buy popcorn without butter even when hes 
not going to the movies 
it tastes good and is filling wolf said eating some before a 
big dinner leaves him with a reasonable appetite he said 
the good news is in train stations and airports theyre 
serving popcorn usually fresh and usually popped in vegetable 
oil he said 
and wolf has a trick not available to most people my other 
secret for keeping thin is im allergic to chocolate

at least two nonmedical members of a schools 
staff should be trained to handle medical emergencies a committee 
of pediatricians says 
training should include first aid cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
and treatment of anaphylaxis a serious allergic reaction 
according to the american academy of pediatrics committee on school 
health 
trained staff members should be able to handle emergencies until 
the school nurse or physician or other emergency personnel can be 
reached the committee says in the december issue of the journal 
pediatrics 
emergencies related to athletics could be handled by a trainer 
or athletic staff member trained in sports medicine and emergency 
care the committee suggested

theres no way to wipe out fire ants 
permanently so its more economic to work on keeping infestations 
manageable a texas entomologist says 
were still hoping for a magic bullet said bastiaan 
bart drees of texas aampm universitys agricultural extension 
service 
he said the best hope for fire ant control appears to be in 
using fungi and insects that prey on fire ants in south america 
the ants original home 
florida researchers have patented one kind of south american 
fungi for use against fire ants but it is likely to be years 
before enough organisms are available to keep down the numbers of 
fire ants he said while in town to speak to the entomological 
society of america 
when fire ants showed up in this country in the 1920s farmers 
tried to wipe them out with chemicals drees said ddt and similar 
chemicals kept the numbers down only temporarily and killed or 
threatened many animals higher up the food chain 
the chemicals also eradicated many of the native ants now 
recognized as the best defense against fire ants they competed 
with fire ants for resources and they mated with fire ant 
queens he said 
the safer pesticides now available offer only a oneyear respite 
and are too expensive to spread on every field he said 
the cheapest chemicals are 10 per acre per year that may not 
provide an economic return said drees so the management 
goal becomes to solve the problems caused by ants without 
necessarily eliminating the fire ant from the ecosystem 
fire ants can be helpful too drees said the ants feed on 
pests that eat cotton the boll weevil the fleahopper boll 
worms they reduce the need for chemical treatment of those 
pests 
and although fire ants attack calves during birth they also eat 
pests that live on cattle such as the lone star tick horn flies 
house flies and stable flies instead of treating a 600acre 
cattle ranch people are just treating the calving pasture drees 
said

despite some highprofile deals like the planned 
74 billion buyout of mca inc merger activity fell by nearly 
half this year as the us takeover market cooled following the 
hectic pace of the 1980s 
merger activity fell 47 percent in 1990 to 4486 deals valued at 
1999 billion from the 4763 deals valued at 3779 billion for 
all of 1989 securities data co a financial research firm based 
in newark nj reported wednesday 
the figures include deals announced during each year the 1990 
total includes matsushita electric industrial cos planned 
acquisition of mca the 62 billion stockswap merger between gte 
corp and contel corp and georgiapacific corps 36 billion 
hostile takeover of great northern nekoosa corp 
the planned mcamatsushita marriage the most recent of the big 
deals and american telephone amp telegraph cos pending 61 
billion hostile bid for ncr corp has led to some speculation that 
the merger boom of the midtolate 1980s might be reviving 
however said bernard black a corporate finance professor at 
columbia law school its a mistake to assume that an overall 
trend has changed because there happens to be a couple of big deals 
announced 
its very hard to do a highly leveraged deal and neither the 
matsushita nor the atampt deal is inconsistent with that he said 
theyre both one big company buying another and theres no reason 
to think that kind of deal is going to disappear 
black referred to the scarcity of financing particularly debt 
financing that has slowed the merger business to a crawl over the 
past year 
mergers and takeovers peaked in late 1988 with the record 2453 
billion debtfinanced takeover of rjr nabisco inc by kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co activity declined early in 1989 and then 
skidded sharply after the failure of several big buyouts most 
notably the 66 billion takeover of federated department stores 
inc by campeau corp 
the federated deal foundered in september 1989 after campeau was 
unable to meet payments on junk bonds used to finance that takeover 
and the earlier 36 billion buyout of allied stores corp the 
market for the risky highyield bonds crashed after campeaus 
troubles became known and financing for mergers and acquisitions 
was suddenly hard to come by 
most of the mergers and buyouts done these days are known as 
strategic deals undertaken by companies looking to expand or build 
market share the mcamatsushita deal gtecontel merger and the 
georgiapacificgreat northern takeover are all examples of such 
transactions 
while this trend remains in place black predicted another kind 
of strategic deal would become more commonplace mergers or buyouts 
involving companies in trouble because of the difficult economy and 
in need of help to compete 
he pointed to the proposed merger between trans world airlines 
and pan am corp as a deal based on such concerns and added im 
sure were going to see a whole lot of bank acquisition activity 
related to competitive pressures 
on friday pan am said it was receptive toward a buyout offer 
from twa that values pan am at about 375 million but the two 
companies are haggling over an interim loan for pan am both are 
considered among the weakest us airlines 
while the us merger market shrank considerably in 1990 
securities data reported a boom in deals involving european firms 
the company reported 667 transactions with european partners with a 
total value of 611 billion up 109 percent from 717 deals worth 
291 billion in 1989 
but the surge was confined to the continent the company said 
worldwide merger activity was down 31 percent this year as 8157 
deals worth 4416 billion were announced compared with 8822 
transactions valued at 6436 billion last year 
in compiling its figures securities data said it considered 
mergers acquisitions share repurchases offers to exchange stock

new york p merger talks between pan am and twa have broken 
down over pan ams request that twa put details of its offer in 
writing 
executives of the struggling airlines exchanged letters 
wednesday blaming each other for the standoff 
richard h francis pan am chief financial officer wrote to twa 
chairman carl c icahn complaining that twa has not provided a term 
sheet with details of its offer 
if you wish to send us a term sheet spelling out in detail any 
twa current proposal we would be pleased to consider it and 
meet with you if it provides an acceptable basis for further 
discussion francis wrote in the letter to icahn wednesday 
twa officials responded that pan am executives would have gotten 
the details if they hadnt called off a meeting scheduled for 
monday 
were not going to give them the documents and have them go 
shop them around mark buckstein twa general counsel said in a 
telephone interview or quote portions of it out of context 
well only go over it with them if they are serious 
buckstein said the details have been given to pan am orally 
icahns letter responding to francis said the buyout offer 
stands as long as pan am does not go into bankruptcy sell assets 
for less than fair value default on major debts or make similar 
moves 
icahn also raised the possibility that pan am may see an 
imminent bankruptcy filing and is concerned whether the offer would 
remain in place he repeated his proposal to provide a bridge loan 
as long as twa was classified as a debtorinpossession which 
would put the airline first in line for repayment if pan am filed 
for bankruptcy protection 
when you are ready to discuss that proposal or the 
shareholder proposal we are ready to meet icahn wrote in his 
response to francis 
icahn launched his offer for pan am dec 16 as he announced 
plans to sell all of twas london routes and some other assets to a 
healthier rival american airlines in a package worth 625 
million 
pan am agreed to sell key london routes and other assets to ual 
subsidiary united airlines in a 400 million deal 
that deal has been held up as us and british officials 
negotiate over whether united will be able to use londons heathrow 
airport as pan am does or be switched to the lessdesirable 
gatwick ual officials have said the deal depends on approval to 
use heathrow

cutrate ornaments christmas cards and other yule paraphernalia 
attracted the affections of shoppers but retail analysts were 
skeptical that an after christmas buying spree would rescue the 
season 
cards half price wrapping half price the bargains are good 
its all for next christmas shopper sandy runte said as she 
pushed her young son and a halfdozen bags in a stroller around the 
grand avenue mall in milwaukee 
the day after christmas historically is one of the busiest 
shopping days of the year and retailers are hoping a late surge 
that began just before the holiday will continue boosting retail 
sales undercut by a slumping economy and worries over the persian 
gulf situation 
a spot check of stores by ap staff around the country showed one 
of the biggest draws for shoppers on the first day after christmas 
was in markeddown decorations 
its incredible its a shopping frenzy said liz gillespie 
marketing director at park plaza mall in little rock ark i 
mean the stores are just jammed especially the ones with seasonal 
products 
karen moody of new york visiting family for the holidays 
headed to marshall fields and co in downtown chicago to buy cards 
and wrap for next year 
ive never paid full price for my christmas cards yet moody 
said its pandemonium up on the 6th floor where seasonal items 
are sold i was so glad to get out of there 
were bargain hunting for crystal said stacia van heuklon 
of rochester minn visiting family in indiana she her two 
brothers two sisters and mother came to chicago for an annual 
tradition its early christmas shopping for next year we do 
this every year everything is 50 percent off 
even for those stores that show gains of a few percentage points 
in sales over a year ago those gains translate into declines when 
the effect of inflation is taken into account for the first 11 
months of the year inflation at the retail level averaged 64 
percent government figures show 
the cake was baked for this season in august and september 
the ingredients for failure were there early on this season was 
like a souffle that never rose said alan millstein publisher of 
fashion network report in new york 
its been worse than disappointing for major department 
stores its been a calamity its the worst year for major 
department stores since the great depression they not only didnt 
meet last years figures they fell behind the rate of inflation 
he said 
retailers used every trick in their bag and nothing seemed to 
work the trick now will be how big will the clearance sales in 
january be 
consumers were very tight with their dollars said david a 
williamson a retail analyst for the advest group inc retailers 
had to be very promotional just to get customers into the stores 
let alone buy stuff 
on wednesday however some retailers were encouraged by what 
they saw 
the parking lots packed and there are people in the store 
its generally one of the busier days of the year said julie 
sertner special events manager at the macys store in the dallas

orders to us factories for big ticket 
durable goods plunged 105 percent in november to the lowest level 
in two and a half years the government said today 
the decline matched the post1958 record for one month set in 
january of this year and indicates the recession most economists 
believe started this fall is deepening 
the drop likely is a harbinger of further layoffs at 
manufacturing plants where payrolls have hrunk by 800000 jobs 
over the past two years 200000 in november alone 
order declines were widespread but were biggest in the 
transportation and defense industries 
its a precipitous decline indicative of a us economy that 
is ending 1990 on a very harsh note said economist stephen s 
roach of morgan stanley amp co i think the manufacturing sector 
right now is in the worst of the recession 
overall orders for durable goods items from bicycles to 
battleships expected to last three or more years totaled a 
seasonallyadjusted 1159 billion last month that was the lowest 
since may 1988 
orders had risen 36 percent in october but have been down in 
six of 11 months so far in 1990 
transportation orders fell 274 percent in november that 
included a drop of 388 percent in aircraft and parts more than 
offsetting octobers 204 percent increase boeing co earlier 
reported new orders of 52 billion down from 107 billion a 
month earlier automobile and parts orders also fell

percent to their lowest levels in two years after edging down 02

computers showed no decline they were unchanged from october to 
november 
electrical machinery orders fell 76 percent and primary metals 
orders dropped 98 percent

most countries that compete successfully with 
the united states for trade have stronger labor unions than this 
country has according to figures put together by an american 
economist 
the us has among the lowest unionization rates in the world 
today wrote thomas karier who teaches economics at eastern 
washington university in cheney washington 
it is especially difficult to argue that unions have impaired 
us competitiveness when much stronger unions in japan canada and 
west germany seem to have had no such effect karier said 
his study trade deficits and labor unions was done for the 
economic policy institute the group is financed by labor unions 
foundations and corporations 
unions bargain for higher wages and better working conditions 
that raise the costs of production higher production costs raise 
the prices of products and make them less competitive with products 
from other countries but karier argues that japan canada and what 
used to be west germany which together account for most of the 
us trade deficit are already highwage countries 
but fariborz ghadar professor of business administration at 
george washington university found kariers reasoning too simple 
competitiveness has to be judged over time and industry by 
industry he said in an interview 
the fact is the industries where the united states is most 
competitive biotechnology aircraft computers are the least 
unionized he said if i were doing a study i would start from 
there and try to find the relationships 
at the brookings institution senior fellow robert z lawrence 
also suggested that the approach to competitiveness should be 
broader taking into account standards of living 
labor union strength in the united states has declined in recent 
years karier estimates that 18 percent of the us workforce was 
unionized in 1985 
the economist compared the united states in this regard with 13 
of its leading competitors only hong kong with 15 percent and 
south korea with 10 percent had lower unionization according to 
figures karier quoted from the cia in its world fact book for 1987 
japan which usually has the biggest surplus in trade with the 
united states was quoted as 30 percent unionized while west 
germany was 34 percent and canada was 31 percent but taiwan 
another big competitor of the united states was at the same level 
18 percent

czechoslovakia will begin to 
auction off small shops and stateowned businesses next month in 
its first round of privatizations the state ctk news agency 
reported thursday 
the privatization is part of the governments program of 
economic reforms it is designed to turn over to private hands some 
130000 small shops and enterprises 
the first auctions are to be held on the last weekend in january 
in prague ctk said auctions will be held in two rounds with the 
first accessible only to czechoslovak citizens and those who left 
the country after 1948 when the communists took over 
shops and enterprises unsold in the first round will be 
auctioned in the second at which some foreigners will be allowed 
to bid 
the privatization process is a key part of reforms aimed at 
transforming czechoslovakias centralized economy into a 
westernstyle market system 
thousands of vendors across the country staged symbolic strikes 
in september demanding they be given first crack at buying the 
shops and a chance to pay up to half the price in installments 
spread over a sevenyear period 
however a law approved in october did not grant preferential 
treatment to any potential buyers 
ctk said the government would take at least a year to sell the 
130000 shops and enterprises at auction 
privatization of large industrial plants and the agricultural 
sector is expected to begin later in 1991

a gallon since the week before christmas the biggest weekly drop 
in prices since iraq invaded kuwait the american automobile 
association said thursday 
selfserve unleaded cost 1282 a gallon this week an aaa 
survey of stations nationwide showed thats 89 cents lower than 
the price on dec 18 and the lowest since a gallon of gas cost 
1273 on sept 5 
oil and gasoline prices have been volatile since iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 persian gulf countries produce a substantial 
portion of the worlds crude oil and any disruption of supplies 
likely would cause prices to soar 
but prices have been moderating since midoctober on increased 
prospects for peace in the gulf oil buyers have also been worried 
about a glut of oil because users have reduced consumption and 
oilproducers have accelerated their output to make up for the loss 
of oil from iraq and kuwait

gasoline the average price for a gallon of midgrade unleaded was

mayor art agnos today signed the nations 
strictest law regulating video display terminal use by workers 
despite a political rivals lastminute charges that the ordinance 
is illegal 
the law requires 15minute breaks and other safety measures 
including proper lighting antiglare screens and adjustable 
furniture and equipment for vdt users 
tom hsieh a city supervisor opposing the measure charged 
wednesday that the ordinance violates the city charter but 
jonathan holtzman special assistant in the city attorneys office 
said it clearly does not 
i am gravely concerned that the city is about to enact a law 
that is extremely vulnerable to legal challenge said hsieh 
hsieh said a section of the city charter mandates that 
supervisors cant make changes in working conditions for city 
employees until the citys civil service commission makes various 
studies but holtzman said the section cited by hsieh applies only 
to changes in their pay 
the law would take effect in 30 days it applies to employees of 
private businesses and city workers 
agnos said sunday that he would sign the ordinance after his 
staff labor and businees officials reached agreement on 
compromises on certain provisions that gave businesses four years 
instead of two to comply 
opponents of the ordinance said the law would be so costly an 
estimated 36 million to about 70 million citywide that it could 
drive some business away

the labor market continues to weaken judged by 
the volume of helpwanted advertisements in newspapers around the 
country the conference board reported thursday 
the board said ad volume declined last month in all nine major 
regions with the pacific east north central and middle atlantic 
regions posting the steepest drops 
the boards helpwanted advertising index stood at 108 in 
november down from 116 the previous month and a sharp 35 points 
below the yearago level the seasonally adjusted index registered 
100 in 1967 
the labor market has been weakening for the last six months 
and it may be another six months before it turns around said 
conference board economist ken goldstein 
but he said the news sounds bleaker than it really is wantad 
volume is unlikely to lose another onefifth of its total of the 
next six months in fact we could see signs of a turnaround 
six months from now and maybe even sooner 
a survey of helpwanted ads in 51 newspapers nationwide revealed 
that labor conditions in oilproducing states have held up better 
than anywhere else the board said 
still the regions reported ad declines of between 108 percent 
for the pacific region to a drop of 19 percent in the mountain 
region 
wantad volume has proven to be sensitive to labor market 
conditions the labor department reported the nations unemployment 
rate registered 59 percent in november

the stock markets nervous system is a bank of 
computers in a downtown building that officials are duplicating at 
another site to avoid accidentinduced shutdowns 
little known outside wall street the securities industry 
automation corp was formed in 1972 by the new york and american 
stock exchanges after the markets no longer could handle the 
trading paperwork load manually 
a transformer fire thursday at siac delayed the start of trading 
at the nyse and amex by 90 minutes pointing out the precarious 
nature of the nations increasingly complex interwoven and 
technologydriven financial markets 
siac is a twoacre mass of 15 major computer systems with about 
300 processors siac processes the stock quotations from the 
nations major exchanges produces the consolidated tape of prices 
and provides support for all computer systems that power the 
exchanges 
all systems on the trading floors at the nyse and amex are run 
through the siac system including trading and clearance and 
settlement of trades 
in addition siac also ties together data on securities listed 
on the nations regional exchanges and overthecounter market 
though those trading systems can operate independently of siac 
were basically the industry processor for the usas stock 
exchanges said richard e leyh siacs executive vice president 
and chief operations officer outside the world sees the 
exchanges they dont necessarily see us standing behind the 
exchanges 
thursdays fire was caused by a transformer explosion shortly 
after midnight none of siacs computers were damaged but fire 
officials closed off the building while checking for chemical 
contamination 
it was the second fire at siac in 13 months in november 1989 
the nyse and amex were shut down for one hour by an electrical 
fire in both instances the lack of an offsite backup system 
meant delays in restoring normal trading operations 
siac which is twothirds owned by the nyse and onethird by 
the amex is moving its base of operations to a new facility 
across new york harbor in brooklyn deigned to avoid unforeseen 
shutdowns 
siac is shifting about half its computers to the new location 
and designing the system so that in the event of a failure at one 
site the other site could be reconfigured handle the full 
processing load the new facility is expected to be fully 
operational by mid1992 leyh said 
our goal is that in the event of a catastrophic failure we 
would be back in business within a day he said in lesser 
events we would be back sooner 
the brooklyn and manhattan systems will operate on separate 
power and telephone grids served by different electric company 
substations to minimize the possibility of both systems going down 
because of an outage 
in the 1989 fire in a basement electrical vault siac was 
forced to switch to backup generators delays were caused because 
some of siacs older computers needed 30 minutes or more to be 
activated on the backup system most of the older models were 
replaced this year leyh said 
while the outages have illustrated the financial systems 
vulnerability some market experts said short shutdowns shouldnt 
be cause for alarm 
technology brings a price said william j breen a finance 
professor at northwestern universitys kellogg graduate school of 
management 
there are snowstorms power lines come down the federal 
reserve has to fiddle with the money supply because an airport got 
closed he said i would doubt if theres a whole lot of people 
who got hurt by the market not opening for an hour and a half this 
morning

a few years ago some experts feared that 
ibm one of the nations most important companies had slipped into 
a dangerous slump 
its products were outdated and overpriced and its payroll and 
cost structure too bloated to deal with a slowdown in computer 
industry sales these critics said 
instead of its sales growing 15 percent or better a year as ibm 
predicted annual growth averaged less than half that from 198489 
ibms profit fell from 66 billion in 1985 to 38 billion in 
1989 and its stock price slipped from as high as 173 a share in 
1987 to a low of 93 a share in december 1989 
the downturn was troubling not just because international 
business machines corp is the nations fourthlargest industrial 
company but because ibms health is a benchmark for the us 
economy and its technical prowess 
some said ibm which employs more people than live in 
minneapolis was too big and bureaucratic to change 
but in the past year or so the worlds largest computer company 
appears to have executed a neat turnaround 
its profit and stock price are on the rebound its product 
lineup has been revitalized and thousands of unneeded employees are 
gone ibm also has become more customeroriented helping dispel 
its reputation as an arrogant giant industry analysts say 
in the mid80s other computer companies started to do well 
ibm was marking time said barry bosak an analyst at smith 
barney harris upham amp co now in 1990 ibm seems to be doing 
better in general than the computer industry 
im impressed by the ability of ibm to make a good number of 
cutbacks and at the same time roll out what is a fairly extensive 
line of new computers he added 
ibm had been losing ground in the product area to nimbler 
younger competitors compaq computer corp lured away corporate 
customers for personal computers while sun microsystems inc 
outshined ibm in the fastgrowing computer workstation market 
in 1990 ibm replaced its slowselling workstations with 
machines that won critical praise and strong orders it made a 
promising return to the home computer market while selling off its 
lowtech typewriter business most important it announced the 
biggest overhaul of its mainframe computers since the 1960s 
mainframes the roomsized computers that store huge amounts of 
data for companies such as airlines are ibms most important 
business the machines and associated equipment and services 
account for more than half of ibms revenue and profit 
analysts say they generally are pleased with ibms revamped 
products rick martin of prudentialbache securities inc calls it 
the companys most competitive lineup since the early 1980s 
analysts also applaud the way ibm handled the transition to its 
new mainframe line announced in september such transitions to a 
new generation of technology often disrupt orders while customers 
await the announcement while ibm felt that lag it was not as 
severe as some analysts expected 
ibm is now shipping all we can build of the new mainframes 
said bill grabe an ibm marketing vice president 
ibm needed the new machines to meet increased competition for 
its onceexclusive mainframe customers two us companies that are 
partially japaneseowned hitachi data systems corp and amdahl 
corp offer competitive machines that are fully compatible with 
ibm models 
ibms mainframes also face competition from the no 2 computer 
maker digital equipment corp which began shipping its first 
mainframes in 1990 
in the past few years ibm also has increased its presence in 
software an area of growing importance by buying minority 
stakes in dozens of small software houses these companies have 
developed programs that tailor ibm computers for specific 
industries 
under chairman john akers who took charge in 1986 ibm reduced 
its worldwide payroll from a high of 407000 that year to 383000 
at the end of 1989 through voluntary severance offers the figure 
is a few thousand lower now though the company hasnt disclosed 
the exact total 
under the most recent cutback announced in december 1989 ibm 
said it would eliminate 10000 us workers the company took a 
24 billion charge against its 1989 profit to pay for the 
severance deals resulting in the steep earnings drop that year 
ibm also has reassigned workers from factory floors and 
headquarters to sales offices where they are helping improve 
customer service and beef up orders 
ibms transformation began after the company reported a 27 
percent drop in earnings in 1986 which it blamed in part on a 
downturn in the us economy and the computer industry 
we also did some real introspection and concluded that part of 
the problem was ours said frank a metz jr ibms chief 
financial officer 
that selfexamination led to the recognition that ibms overhead 
was too costly its payroll and plants were at a level that 
required annual revenue growth of 13 percent to 15 percent to turn 
a profit while revenue actually was growing at about half that 
rate 
ibm also decided it must reemphasize our commitment to our 
customer metz said in a recent interview at the companys 
hilltop headquarters about 25 miles north of new york city 
we concluded that although our products were good it was 
taking us far too long to get our products to the marketplace and 
too often they werent as responsive as they needed to be to our 
customer requirements he said 
that led ibm to loosen the centralized decisionmaking that had 
long been its hallmark 
there are a lot of decisions made in this company today 
important decisions operational decisions that were not 
involved in here metz said 
an association that represents ibm customers says it has noticed 
the companys new attitude 
the openness has changed tremendously said merrikay lee 
secretary of common which represents users of ibm midrange 
computers they used to listen but never really incorporated 
their customers into the fold now theyre much more willing to 
talk and listen 
metz said the process of downsizing ibm will continue though he 
doesnt expect another major restructuring 
ibms moves already have boosted its profit for the first nine 
months of 1990 ibm earned 356 billion compared with 317 
billion in the same period a year earlier 
analyst cliff friedman of bear stearns amp co predicts ibm will 
earn 1020 a share for 1990 up from the 905 a share ibm earned 
in 1989 before the restructuring charge slashed profit to 647 
ibms improving fortunes have been reflected in its stock price 
which has risen to about 113 a share 
although rejuvenated ibm isnt out of the woods one looming 
threat is the recession another is the increasing competition in 
the computer industry as its growth rate slows 
in addition ibms profit could be squeezed by the increasing 
interest among computer uses for open systems those that 
follow industry standards so that machines from differ makers can 
work together easily opensystem computers have a lower profit 
margin than proprietary models such as ibms mainframes and 
minicomputers 
over the long term ibms going to wind up losing market 
share claimed analyst stephen cohen of soundview financial group 
inc industry profit margins are going to be declining because 
its a maturing industry i think ibm is going to face some very 
stiff competition

a report showing us durable goods orders fell a

worth of trading after the durable goods numbers and that was it

enough to make people reopen their books and dump dollars before 
the new year said michael malpede an analyst at refco group 
ltd in chicago he noted that a good portion of the decline 
reflected auto plant shutdowns rather than declines in a variety of 
industries 
the german mark was boosted by the confirmation of gennady i 
yanayev as soviet vice president he was mikhail s gorbachevs 
choice for the newly created office and the approval offered an 
air of stability to the politically torn soviet union 
the focus was on us economic fundamentals the soviet union

a transformer explosion and fire in lower 
manhattan delayed stock trading nationwide for 90 minutes thursday 
a reminder that wall streets sophisticated computer systems are 
vulnerable to unforeseen calamities 
the trading halt marked the third such disruption this year but 
stock exchange representatives emphasized that none of the problems 
centered on their own computer operations 
the fire at the 55 water st skyscraper in southern manhattan 
broke out shortly after midnight sending smoke into the securities 
industry automation corp a joint venture between the new york and 
american stock exchanges controlling the computer system that 
supports trading 
the new york and american exchanges were the first to announce 
that the usual 930 am opening would be delayed but the nations 
regional stock exchanges also refrained from trading bowing to a 
request from the securities and exchange commission 
sec spokeswoman mary mccue said the regulatory authority wanted 
all the markets to reopen at the same time to give all investors 
equal opportunity to buy or sell 
regional exchanges which include the midwest pacific 
cincinnati boston and philadelphia exchanges trade some of same 
stocks as the new york and american exchanges but they handle only 
a small percentage of the total volume of stock traded on the major 
exchanges 
hundreds of workers milled about the chilly streets while others 
followed instructions on handwritten notes by the doors of the 
building and reported for work elsewhere for example citibank the 
nations biggest banking company which occupies several floors of 
the building relocated employees to other offices in the city 
despite the upheaval in the streets market observers said the 
fire did not cause too much of a problem for investors since 
trading is typically thin during the christmasnew years holiday 
week 
fortunately it happened at a time when theres very little 
to do said michael metz a vice president at oppenheimer amp co 
adding that most large institutional investors already have 
realigned their portfolios ahead of the new year and were not 
actively buying or selling stocks 
shortterm traders and other professionals were the most 
affected with the market closed for part of the day they have a 
smaller arena in which to operate metz said it amounts to an 
unprofitable day 
trading disruptions are relatively rare but the thursday delay 
was the third this year on nov 23 a power failure delayed 
trading on the nyse for 90 minutes shortly after the opening bell 
on aug 13 a fire at a con edison power substation forced the 
american stock exchange new york mercantile exchange and other 
futures markets in southern manhattan to close by early afternoon 
but the new york stock exchange was unaffected 
more than a year ago another firerelated power problem at siac 
briefly delayed nyse trading 
im surprised there isnt some failureproof source of 
power metz said 
nyse spokeswoman sharon gamsin said in the next 12 to 14 months 
siac will have a backup facility across the east river in 
brooklyn 
the facility located at what is called the metrotech complex 
will allow siac to switch to an alternative computing source which 
can process 500 million trades a day in case of a fire or other 
emergency 
though the blaze was under control at 316 am officials 
feared hazardous polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs may have 
contaminated several floors of the 54floor skyscraper samples of 
the building were taken to an environmental protection agency lab 
for analysis but the building was later found to be untainted by 
the cancercausing substance 
siac was allowed to enter the building at midmorning and its 
computers were up and running by 11 am when the new york and 
american stock exchanges opened trading the markets closed at the 
normal 4 pm time 
trading in overthecounter issues began as usual at 930 am 
overthecounter stock trading is conducted independently of the 
nyse and the american exchange the national association of 
securities dealers automated quotation system or nasdaq reports 
quotes for overthecounter stocks 
twentysix firefighters and 14 others were treated for possible 
exposure to pcbs as a result of the fire said lt jim powell a 
new york city fire department spokesman four firefighters were 
hospitalized

delta air lines thursday asked the us 
department of transportation to hold a formal hearing on plans by 
pan am and twa to sell transatlantic air routes to the countrys 
two largest airlines 
chicagobased ual corp parent of united airlines agreed in 
october to buy most of pan ams london routes and other assets for 
400 million fort worthbased american said in middecember it 
would buy twas routes to london and other overseas points for 445 
million 
the deals hinge on whether american and united will be allowed 
to serve londons heathrow airport britain has resisted american 
carriers attempts to fly to heathrow forcing them to use less 
convenient gatwick 
delta is concerned that it and other us carriers will bear the 
burden of any concessions the us government makes to get british 
support for the deals 
the dot should not approve these transactions until it knows 
what price must be paid to the british to obtain their 
approval delta said in its filing 
the transfers are so massive that they raise fundamental 
policy issues affecting competition and market structure 
internationally and domestically delta chairman and president 
ronald w allen said never before has such an enormous 
restructuring of the international air travel market structure been 
proposed 
delta is seeking to add to its two uslondon routes 
if the deals are completed united and american would both serve 
london from los angeles and two new yorkarea airports kennedy

crude oil prices fell slightly thursday in 
extremely light trading that brokers attributed to little 
significant news from the persian gulf 
unleaded gasoline prices rallied on reports that refineries were 
cutting back production because of marginally reduced demand 
traders said 
on the new york mercantile exchange light sweet crude for 
february delivery fell 21 cents to 2701 per 42gallon barrel 
after rising 130 on wednesday other contract months also fell 
the market was trendless said christian gohler a trader 
with merrill lynch energy futures 
traders said a statement by iraq that it was ready for serious 
and constructive dialogue on the middle east crisis was offset by 
a denial it was launching a new peace initiative ahead of a united 
nations deadline 
the un has given iraq until jan 15 to withdraw from kuwait 
and has authorized the use of force after that date to evict iraqi 
forces 
furthermore president bush said there had been no progress in 
efforts to work out a date for secretary of state james a baker 
iii to visit baghdad to discuss a peaceful situation to the gulf 
situation 
the crude oil market is just drifting lower as the whole jan 
15 date looks like it could be pushed back that has had a calming 
effect on the market said brian tagler a broker with shearson 
lehman brothers inc 
crude oil prices have risen on the prospects of war since oil 
supplies likely would be curtailed during a war increasing their 
value 
market professionals also said crude oil contracts were being 
sold in advance of the end of the month and the year as traders 
liquidate positions 
among refined products traded on the mercantile exchange 
unleaded regular gasoline for january delivery rose 50 cent to 
6864 cents a gallon after a 190cent rise wednesday later months 
also were higher 
tagler said oil refineries reported they were reducing gasoline 
production because gasoline per barrel was selling for only 
slightly higher than crude oil due to slightly lower demand lower 
production means less supplies which pushes prices higher 
home heating oil futures fell 038 cent to 8088 cents per 
gallon on contracts for january delivery after rising 232 cents on 
wednesday traders attributed the drop to reports that cold weather 
would not last in the northeast later months were mixed 
natural gas for february delivery was down 39 cents at 1960 
per 1000 cubic feet later months were mostly higher 
after the market closed the american petroleum institute 
reported that the nations crude oil inventories rose in the week 
ending dec 21 to 3347 million barrels from 3315 million barrels 
the previous week but that was still down sharply from 3420 
million barrels a year ago 
crude oil imports rose in the week to 56 million barrels daily 
from 51 million barrels the previous week api said imports were 
lower though than 62 million barrels daily a year ago 
among other products api reported that distillate inventories 
which include home heating oil fell to 1315 million barrels from 
1326 million barrels a week ago but inventories were higher than 
1122 million barrels a year earlier 
gasoline inventories dropped to 2237 million barrels from 2246 
million barrels a week ago but were up from 2217 million barrels 
a year earlier api said
