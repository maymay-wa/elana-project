prime ministerdesignate tadeusz mazowiecki 
came to solidaritys birthplace sunday and told 10000 cheering 
poles not to lose faith as he tries to form the east blocs first 
government led by noncommunists 
the communist partys central committee released a resolution 
sunday that threatened to withhold its support for the new 
government unless agreement was reached on its program platform 
and political structure which should take place before the premier 
is appointed 
it demanded the party be given the number of cabinet seats that 
correspond to its state and political potential and added 
otherwise we will not be able to take responsibility for the 
course of developments 
the official pap news agency published the resolution and said it 
was adopted at a central committee meeting saturday 
mazowiecki met sunday with solidarity chief lech walesa and other 
leaders of the independent movement to begin the task of creating a 
government facing disastrous economic problems and the delicate 
political situation 
mazowiecki expects to decide by the end of the month how the 
government ministries will be divided among solidarity its two 
smallparty allies the united peasant party and democratic party 
and the communists a spokesman said 
the communists will continue to wield power through president 
wojciech jaruzelski who nominated mazowiecki as prime minister 
saturday the president will formally submit the nomination to the 
sejm or lower house of the national assembly on monday but no 
action is expected until wednesday confirmation is all but assured 
the central committee resolution denounced the peasant and 
democratic parties and said they bear the burden of historical 
responsibility for switching allegiance to solidarity 
even before mazowieckis nomination the communists were promised 
the ministries of defense and interior which control the army and 
police but the resolution indicated the party would demand more 
it also stressed polands membership in the warsaw pact military 
alliance and the comecon economic treaty between eastbloc 
countries solidarity has said it would not undermine the warsaw 
pact 
four decades of control by the communists have ended with the 
success of a movement founded by walesa and backed by poles such as 
mazowiecki who was imprisoned by jaruzelski after the martiallaw 
crackdown to suppress solidarity in december 1981 
solidarity took some time sunday to celebrate 
poland is alive mazowoiecki proclaimed invoking the 
national anthem which begins poland has not yet perished so long 
as were alive 
walesa told the crowd this is our greatest achievement since 
the communists took power after world war ii 
mazowiecki who edits solidaritys weekly newspaper in warsaw 
drove with an associate to gdansk in his red compact car they 
attended mass in the packed st brygidas church 
then mazowiecki and walesa spoke from the rectory steps at the 
church near the lenin shipyard where solidarity began in 1980 
today when we open this historic chapter we must reject a 
feeling of hopelessness and helplessness mazowiecki said we 
can do it i believe that we can do it 
there was a small group of antiwalesa demonstrators in the 
crowd who chanted we need bread not a premier 
i know we need bread more than a premier mazowiecki 
answered walesa asked for a show of hands of who was with him and 
who was against support was overwhelming 
the two then met with the leadership of solidarity and its 
parliament caucus 
we are going to wake up initiative in poland and lead to a 
situation where marketizing the economy is not connected with the 
decrease of living standards mazowiecki said afterward 
it is clear that solidarity will renew its appeals to the west 
for financial assistance 
we will ask for greater help from both internal and external 
forces so that this undertaking by solidarity can bring greater 
effects walesa said otherwise it is going to be bad 
asked about the composition of the new government before the 
meeting mazowiecki said only i have been thinking about it but 
it is very tentative 
among the economic difficulties facing the new leaders are 
widespread shortages more than 100 percent inflation a 39 billion 
foreign debt and unprofitable and outmoded industries 
it was the communist governments inability to resurrect the 
economy and control social tension that led it to negotiate with 
solidarity after years of trying to obliterate the easts blocs 
first legal independent trade union 
the talks led to the blocs freest legislative elections ever and 
solidaritys overwhelming victory the legislature elected 
jaruzelski president without a vote to spare but solidarity refused 
to join a communistcontrolled government and instead walesa put 
together a coalition with a parliamentary majority

a couple who became engaged over dinner at 
an inn here wanted to be married at the same spot but their romance 
tripped over the state line 
the couples marriage license was issued in new york state and 
they became engaged at a table on the massachusetts side of the 
swiss hutte inn 
the groom was all for going ahead in massachusetts but the 
bride wondered if the ceremony would actually be legal innkeeper 
cynthia alper said so the wedding party put sentiment aside and 
stepped over the border 
folks in this berkshire hills town of 1300 people just across 
the line from the new york towns of hillsdale and copake and 12 
miles from connecticut are used to coping with different 
jurisdictions the catamout ski resort just down the road from the 
inn is spread over both new york state towns as well as egremont 
managing the swiss hutte inn was more complicated when the two 
states had differing drinking ages 
but now all mrs alper has to cope with are two sets of property 
and other taxes two sets of permits and inspectors from both 
massachusetts and new york the inn has four tables and an outside 
patio in massachusetts and 12 tables in new york 
its something that gets peoples attention and they like to 
talk bout it mrs alper said but outside of some amusing 
incidents like last saturdays wedding it really doesnt cause a 
great deal of problems 
she is however trying to get a massachusetts telephone listing 
the phone is now on the new york side of the restaurant so it is a 
toll call to telephone anywhere else in egremont

an explosion ripped open a manhattan street 
saturday spewing steam high into the air killing two people 
injuring at least 26 others and prompting the evacuation of hundreds 
of residents officials said 
the whole street is broken up and there is steam pouring into 
the sky like a geyser in a national park said efrain parrilla a 
fire department spokesman at the scene 
the 630 pm blast on 20th street near third avenue in the 
exclusive gramercy park neighborhood apparently occurred when 
underground pipes carrying steam to buildings broke said 
consolidated edison co spokesman martin gitten con ed workers had 
been working on a steam line 
a man and a woman were pronounced dead at bellevue hospital 
center said hospital administrator peter schectman the two 
suffered multiple injuries schectman said no other details on the 
dead were available 
fire officials initially said two con ed workers had been killed 
but gitten later said all utility workers at the site were alive and 
accounted for four con ed workers were among the injured 
the injuries suffered by the workers and at least 22 other people 
included severe burns shock and minor cuts and bruises said 
emergency medical service spokeswoman lynn shulman 
one of those injured was a taxi driver who apparently hurt his 
knees when the explosion threw his cab out of control schectman 
said 
the blast strewed debris along the street steam roared at least 
15 stories into the air an hour after the explosion and continued 
to hiss out of the ground at a slower rate until 1030 pm when it 
was shut off 
officials closed businesses and evacuated people from nearby 
buildings including an 18story apartment building next to the 
explosion site broken windows could be seen at least 11 stories up 
we believe we have all the people in the exposed buildings down 
now said assistant fire chief william feehan we have some on 
the roof but they are safe 
people remained out of their homes late saturday although gitten 
said further damage was unlikely the red cross provided emergency 
shelter to 20 people said spokeswoman jennifer hassan 
some merchants fled without locking the doors to their 
businesses but police patroled to prevent looting 
people said they were rocked by the blast 
everything around here shook said richard dipierri who 
works at a restaurant about four blocks away it sounded like a 
jet engine roar 
i grabbed my cat and ran out said resident rick vandever 
i saw people running down the street 
mayor edward i koch rushed to the scene 
one injured con ed worker was in fair condition at new york 
hospitalcornell medical center with burns and injuries to his head 
and chest said linda franklin a hospital administrator 
a man who suffered burns to his back and the cab driver were in 
stable condition at bellevue schectman said the other injured were 
taken to other hospitals shulman said 
gitten said con ed crews were trying to isolate the cause of the 
blast which occurred on the same block where a water main break was 
reported saturday morning 
the 24inch pipe that blew up carries pressurized steam that gets 
as hot as 400 degrees gitten said 
large pipes under streets throughout lower manhattan carry steam 
to about 2000 customers gitten said 
it is an old technology but youll find it in a lot of major 
cities weve seen a growth in our steam system in the last few 
years gitten said a lot of new buildings are opting to take 
steam

a majority of women believe us society has not 
changed enough to let women compete with men on an equal basis 
according to a new york times poll 
according to the survey published in the newspapers sunday 
editions 56 percent of the women polled said equality had not been 
achieved and 49 percent of the men surveyed agreed 
among female babyboomers between the ages of 30 and 44 62 
percent of those surveyed agreed with the statement most men are 
willing to let women get ahead but only if women do all the 
housework at home 
the poll was based on telephone interviews with 1025 women and 
472 men from june 2025 with a few questions repeated july 2530 to 
check for the effect of the us supreme courts decision permitting 
states to put limits on abortion the poll had a margin of error of 
3 percentage points meaning results could vary by that amount in 
either direction 
thirtythree percent of the women and 37 percent of the men 
surveyed said childrens needs are slighted the most when a woman 
combines a job with marriage and motherhood the times said 
substantial majorities of married women surveyed said they do 
most of the food shopping cooking house cleaning bill paying and 
child care the poll found 
but men agreed that their spouses do more around the house and 
about half conceded that women do more than their fair share of 
household chores the times said 
threefifths of the women interviewed said that mens attitudes 
toward women have improved in the last two decades only half the 
women surveyed five years ago said the same 
only half of the women between ages 18 and 29 agreed that men 
still run almost everything and usually dont include women when 
important decisions are made the times said

a smithsonian institution official met with 
indian leaders this week to discuss the handling of the remains of 
indian ancestors but no agreement was reached a smithsonian 
spokeswoman said saturday 
indian leaders want the remains returned to them museums and 
universities throughout the country argue however that the bones 
are vital to research 
leslie logan of the smithsonians office of public affairs said 
smithsonian secretary robert mcc adams met thursday with rep ben 
nighthorse campbell dcolo and suzan harjo executive director of 
the national congress of american indians to discuss the issue 
there was some movement but not enough to announce a settlement 
saturday as hoped logan said 
during a reception for about 650 people at the wheelwright museum 
of the american indian in santa fe adams announced plans for a 
national museum for the american indian to be located in washington 
if approved construction on the 175 million museum would begin 
in 1992 
but the issue of returning to tribes some of the 35000 skeletons 
and other sacred objects held by the smithsonian was not raised 
during the reception 
the issue of the remains was taken up during a meeting this week 
in albuquerque of the national congress of american indians 
the group estimates the bones of 25 million indians are held in 
public and private collections nationwide museum spokesmen dispute 
the figure estimating institutions hold the remains of 100000 to 
250000 
museums and universities study the bones to learn more about the 
bone structure diseases and lifestyles of american indians more 
than 100 years ago 
tribes are pressuring the museums and universities to return the 
bones so they can be properly buried 
campbell said indian support for a national museum of the 
american indian is mixed he said settling disputes between the 
tribes and the smithsonian over the remains is crucial if the 
smithsonian wants indians support 
we have to deal with the bones issue said campbell who 
sponsored the bill to fund the museum a directive for the 
smithsonian to work with the tribes to settle it is included in the 
bill 
adams described the proposed museum as a flagship of american 
cultural diversity 
it is only natural that it should be indianled and hence it 
will have a special sensitivity in its presentation of the spiritual 
and symbolic dimension of american indian history but the museum is 
not a commemoration of the past it is a celebration bridging the 
past present and future 
herman agoyo director of the all indian pueblo council a 
coalition of new mexico pueblos said the bill to begin planning 
and to push the smithsonian to settle the bones issue has the 
councils full support 
we look forward to actively participating he said for the 
first time we will not be sitting on the outside looking in

the marchioness pleasure cruiser was struck by a dredging barge 
near blackfriars bridge shortly before 2 am 9 pm edt saturday

board were in their 20s

a pleasure boat carrying about 120 people sank in 
the river thames early sunday after it was rammed by a barge and cut 
in half authorities said several people died 89 were rescued and 
about 30 were missing 
scotland yard first said all seven crew members of the bowbelle 
sandandgravel dredging barge were arrested and were being 
questioned but scotland yard later said only the captain and second 
mate were arrested and that it was questioning the five other crew 
members as witnesses 
the london fire brigade said several bodies were recovered from 
the river but would not say how many scotland yard confirmed a 
womans body was recovered near hammersith bridge eight miles 
upstream from the collision 
it was not immediately known if any americans were on the boat 
that sank 
police said the marchioness pleasure cruiser chartered for a 
private birthday party was rammed from behind by the empty barge 
shortly before 2 am 
survivors said the barge struck the boat a second time and then 
ran straight over it 
the marchioness sank within two minutes in 25 feet of water near 
blackfriars bridge in central london police said port of london 
authority divers later reported the hull was cut in half 
the count of victims was complicated by uncertainty over the 
number of guests aboard the doubledecker marchioness built during 
world war ii the boat is licensed to carry 149 passengers and two 
crew members 
police said there were about 120 passengers and crew and about 
30 were still missing 10 hours later but ken dewan owner of the 
marchioness company said only 110 people were aboard there was no 
passenger list 
we believe there were somewhere in the region of 120 people on 
board police commander tony speed told a news conference 
sadly we expect more bodies given the speed at which the vessel 
sank the time of night and its location in the thames its quite 
remarkable that 89 people survived 
earlier reports that 98 people were hospitalized proved incorrect 
transport minister michael portillo said he has ordered an 
immediate inquiry by the governments marine accidents investigation 
branch in addition to the police inquiry 
prime minister margaret thatcher on holiday in austria issued a 
statement through her office saying she was deeply distressed by 
the tragedy 
the 2000ton barge owned by ready mixed concrete ltd is 80 
yards long making it one of the largest vessels registered on the 
river 
survivors said the pleasure boat was privately chartered by a 
modeling agency for a birthday party and most people on board were 
in their 20s the boat was chartered from 1 am to 6 am 
many of those dancing on the top deck of the marchioness jumped 
or were thrown overboard others dancing below deck were trapped 
dozens of passengers swam to safety and 89 people were taken to 
three hospitals nearly all suffering minor injuries police said 
some people were treated for shock at the savoy the exclusive 
riverside hotel 
ambulance crews firefighters and police helped to rescue

americans infected with aids may need 2 
billion to 5 billion annually to pay for the antiviral drug azt 
that delays progression of the deadly disease federal health 
officials estimate 
the department of health and human services last week expanded by 
400000 the number of aids patients eligible for azt treatment by 
declaring its effectiveness among patients whose disease is at an 
early stage with no symptoms 
the drug was already available to an estimated 200000 patients 
with symptoms of aids in the protocol now approved for the drug 
azt now costs about 8000 annually for each patient according to 
national institutes of health estimates 
youre talking about 5 billion said john klemm an analyst 
for the federal health care financing agency its a huge burden 
also known as zidovudine azt is marketed by burroughs wellcome 
co under the brand name retrovir it formally was known by the name 
azidothymidine which was shortened in usage to azt it is the only 
antiviral drug approved to combat the aids virus 
however one finding of the drug trial announced last week could 
relieve some of the expected new financial pressure 
a third of the patients in the drug trial were given azt doses of 
500 milligrams daily the regimen called for taking a 100 mg pill 
every four hours while awake the drug was as effective for these 
patients as was a higher dose for others in the trial 
the licensed use of azt calls for 1200 mg a day two 100 mg 
pills every four hours day and night 
dr daniel hoth who directed the drug trial said doctors probably 
will now start prescribing the lower doses for their patients 
this in effect would reduce the number of azt pills taken daily 
from 12 to five since the pills typically cost 184 each based on 
a survey of washington d c drug stores the revised dosage would 
drop the cost from 2208 per patient per day to 920 a day that 
would drop the annual cost per patient from about 8000 to 3358 
in turn it would drop the national cost of azt based on the nih 
estimate of 600000 patients who could benefit from its use from 
about 5 billion to about 2 billion 
activists and patients in the aids community hailed the new drug 
trial findings as a major advance in the war on the disease but 
almost in the next breath they asked who was going to help these 
additional aids patients pay for the expensive therapy 
the announcement said jean mcguire executive director of the 
aids action council highlights the inherent contradictions 
between the departments aggressive drug development efforts and its 
lackluster pursuit of creative answers to the to the problems of 
access and financing 
drug development success is meaningless without the assurance 
of patient access she added 
sen edward m kennedy dmass made the same point 
science has given us the tools to help hundreds of thousands of 
people fight for their life what is lacking is an equitable 
formula for delivering those tools to americans in need kennedy 
said 
hhs secretary louis w sullivan said the new findings from drug 
trials developed so fast that officials have not yet mapped out a 
plan to help the newly eligible patients pay for azt treatment 
sullivan used his authority to order medicare and medicaid 
reimbursement drug payments to patients who qualify under those 
programs but klemm said preliminary studies indicate the few of the 
newly eligible patients qualify for medicare or medicaid 
most patients who test positive for the human immunodeficiency 
virus hiv that causes aids but who show no other symptoms of the 
disease are young and not disabled which disqualifies them for 
medicare he said 
and many are not poor enough under the poverty tests used by 
staterun medicaid program or do not have the dependents necessary 
to qualify if they are working they may have to quit or something 
in order to impoverish themselves to become eligible klemm said 
thomas sheridan director of public policy for the aids action 
council said only 1 percent of americans infected with hiv are 
receiving any benefit from medicare 
sheridan estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent of the 200000 
patients with aids symptoms are receiving medicaid reimbursement for 
azt most patients he said either have medical insurance or pay 
for azt out of their own pocket 
insurance companies said sheridan may not pay for azt for the 
group of 400000 because the drug currently is not licensed for 
prescription to hivinfected patients who are asymptomatic 
private insurance has been showing an alarmingly uncomfortable 
trend toward disallowing payment for drugs based on their unlicensed 
status he said azt is now licensed for patients who have aids 
not for people who are only hiv positive 
unless action is taken by the federal government sheridan said 
many of the group of 400000 may have to spend themselves into 
poverty to qualify for medicaid help on their drug bills 
dr mervyn silverman president of the american foundation for 
aids research said the drug trial findings demonstrate that aids 
virus infections may now be treatable this means he said that 
asymptomatic people who avoided being tested for aids because there 
was no treatment until there were symptoms now have a strong 
medical reason to be tested for the virus 
as a result he expects there will be flood of patients getting 
the aids test and finding that they are positive 
ill be very surprised if this doesnt lead to a significant 
increase in the demand for azt said silverman its going to be 
very very costly 
help he said will have to come from the federal government 
because local and state governments resources for treating 
hivinfected patients already are strained 
communities are at the breaking point said silverman new 
york city is in gridlock san francisco is almost crumbling

a person youve never met touting a company 
youve never heard of tries to sell you a stock you never wanted 
sometimes its an honest broker pushing a lowpriced but 
highrisk legitimate stock but often the call is from a 
boilerroom bank of telephones staffed by smoothtalking sales 
people preying on the anxieties or greed of unsophisticated buyers 
a high pressure salesman might say if you dont buy now youre 
going to miss the boat says robert ferri of the national 
association of securities dealers the only boat youre going to 
miss is the titanic 
the nasd oversees overthecounter stocks and brokers who deal in 
them 
a rising tide of fraud involving penny stocks inexpensive but 
risky securities that usually arent traded on any stock exchanges 
is worrying securities regulators and industry officials across the 
country 
penny stocks in themselves arent illegal but the north american 
securities administrators association a washingtonbased 
organization of state investment regulators calls the fraudulent 
sale of these securities the biggest threat facing the average 
investor 
three weeks ago 14 people and two companies were charged in 
chicago with an alleged 10 million penny stock scam in which the 
companies share prices were artificially raised before being sold 
at large profits 
the securities and exchange commission alleged in a civil 
complaint that the companies were only shams created to peddle 
stock one companys stock first offered at 15 cents per share in 
1985 rose to a high of 6 per share through announcements of bogus 
mergers and other scams that drew in millions of dollars from 
investors around the country 
in florida earlier this year state authorities moved to revoke 
the license of a denverbased penny stock brokerage after it 
allegedly bilked thousands of investors including an 80yearold 
woman who lost about 30000 
penny stock fraud is the fraud du jour says lawrence h 
fuchs floridas deputy comptroller 
a disproportionate number of customer complaints about 
brokerdealers in our state derive from the penny stock market 
said john b hiatt director of the new mexico securities division 
i would say its rapidly coming to the forefront of our 
activities said irwin fisk chief investigator for the california 
division of corporations in southern california 
in the 23 years hes been on the job fisk said his division had 
seen about six penny stock fraud cases weve got that many or 
more pending right now most in the last few months 
officials say the very nature of penny stocks makes them prone to 
scam artists 
trading for a few cents up to a few dollars penny stocks usually 
are issued by new companies ranging from energy developers to makers 
of wouldbe wonder drugs they often have an untested or uneven 
earnings history 
because most penny stocks are not listed nationally information 
about them is hard to obtain and fraudulent claims are difficult to 
dispute 
information is power and you dont have it with penny stocks 
said ferri the nasd spokesman 
he said unscrupulous brokers offering stocks in unsolicited 
telephone calls known as cold calling might be pushing 
legitimate stocks but not for the price at which they are actually 
trading the stocks arent usually carried in newspaper stock 
listings and buyers have no way of knowing their real price 
another scam consists of constantly selling stock buying it back 
and selling it again at increasingly higher prices like a pyramid 
scheme until the last buyers are left holding stocks that are only 
worth a fraction of the price they paid 
the sec has created a penny stock task force and recently it 
approved a rule that will make it impossible for unscrupulous 
brokers to conduct penny stock sales with new customers over the 
phone 
the new rule effective jan 1 1990 requires buyers to approve 
the first three transactions with a new broker in writing and 
requires the broker to determine the buyers financial status and 
the suitability of the stock purchase 
sarah b ackerson an sec attorney assigned to the task force 
said the agency still is compiling nationwide statistics about penny 
stock fraud 
but she noted that in the first half of the fiscal year which 
will end sept 30 the sec received 2462 complaints about penny 
stock fraud compared with 1510 for all of last year 
regulators and industry officials caution investors to be wary 
when considering penny stocks especially when offered through 
unsolicited phone calls 
hang up on them advises floridas fuchs investigate a 
company thoroughly before you commit money 
i would ask for a prospectus before i bought anything said

wooden thumb screws neck collars a ball 
and chain lie on joe sparks floor part of his collection of 
slavery memorabilia and his research into the life of an escaped 
slave who was one of the inspirations for uncle toms cabin 
sparks unusual collection began in 1967 because of a local story 
he read about former slave josiah henson besides collecting 
memorabilia he has worked to see henson honored in the western 
kentucky county which he fled in 1830 with his wife and their four 
children 
sparks a 60yearold electrical contractor led the effort to 
have us 60 from owensboro to the hancock county line designated in 
june by a state marker as the josiah henson trail the route passes 
the site where henson lived as a slave 
it kind of got me sparks said of harriet beecher stowes 
novel of slave life which he read after he became interested in 
henson the novel a bestseller when it came out in 1852 has been 
credited with fostering antislavery sentiment in the decade before 
the civil war mrs stowe met henson in 1849 and said that his story 
was an inspiration for the novel 
here was a man who lived here for that period of time and who 
became famous because of an internationally famous book sparks 
said 
he has playbills of productions of uncle toms cabin 
firstedition copies of the novel comic books and childrens 
editions of the novel he also has ownership papers on slaves and 
items of restraint he has picked up at flea markets and through 
antique trade magazines 
you have to know what youre looking for sparks said 
henson was born into slavery in 1789 and worked on plantations 
in maryland and kentucky he was ordained a minister in the 
methodist episcopal church in 1828 and earned money preaching to 
try to buy his freedom after he made a down payment of 275 toward 
his 400 price the plantation owner raised the price to 1000 
henson his wife and children escaped kentucky in september 1830 
by rowing across the ohio river two weeks later they walked into 
cincinnati they reached canada in october 1830 and eventually 
settled in dresden ontario where henson became a noted educator 
and abolitionist 
sparks president of the josiah henson historical society in 
owensboro has proposed developing the old amos riley plantation 
where henson served as an overseer as a historic site 
the plantation house no longer exists on the privately owned 
land and a soybean field covers the ground where hensons slave 
cabin stood sparks said he used old property deeds to map the 
boundaries of the plantation which once encompassed thousands of 
acres 
slavery sparks said was a cruel system and we would have 
been better off without it but he said preserving the plantation 
site is important from a historical viewpoint 
its among the most significant sites in the state of 
kentucky sparks said we are trying to preserve a part of 
history its our heritage and we have to face it 
owensboro mayor david adkisson also supports the idea of a 
permanent place to honor henson 
i think it would have to be done with sensitivity in a 
historical setting not in a sensational way or as a commercial 
tourist attraction adkisson said it would be to commemorate 
the life of a very courageous black man 
its unfortunate that the image of uncle tom has developed in 
a way that became a derogatory term about certain black people the 
life of josiah henson is a very proud story 
sparks and adkisson admit that henson who died in 1883 in 
dresden likely would have been surprised to know that two white men 
were trying to honor him in the county that he fled 
he probably also would be surprised a park in dresden ontario 
was named for him adkisson said 
the park in ontario is called uncle toms cabin historic site 
said barbara g carter hensons greatgreatgranddaughter who 
manages the site 
last year about 10000 people from all over the world visited the 
site mrs carter said in september 1983 canada honored henson 
with a postage stamp she said 
he is held in very high esteem here mrs carter said

after working itself into a buy american 
frenzy over coproduction of a jet fighter with japan congress 
again faces a new protectionism battle over renewing an obscure 
39yearold law on weapons purchases 
the defense production act of 1950 gives the president power to 
limit or prohibit the acquisition of foreign products the korean 
war era legislation also gives the government authority to subsidize 
industries including those that produce goods for the pentagon 
nearly four decades later lawmakers are hoping to use renewal of 
the law which expires sept 30 to infuse life into the depressed 
us defense industrial base and limit foreign sources for weapons 
components 
the interest in the problems of us defense manufacturers comes 
on the heels of a rancorous debate earlier this year over 
coproduction agreement of the fsx fighter an advanced version of 
the f16 
opponents of the fsx transaction charged that it would shut 
down american industries by handing the japanese vital us 
technology however congressional efforts to prevent the 
usnegotiated deal or impose conditions failed 
next month defense industry woes and the increasing use of 
foreign suppliers for weapons components moves to the forefront 
again 
the problem has been a subject of numerous defense industry 
government accounting office and congressional reviews since the 
mid1970s said sen alan dixon dill a member of both the 
senate armed services and banking committees 
yet until recently little has been done to shape practical 
solutions dixon said last month 
the center for strategic and international studies found that 
from 1982 to 1987 the number of us companies supplying goods to 
the defense department dropped from 118000 to 38000 
william g phillips president of the national council for 
industrial defense said the pentagons reliance on foreign 
companies has become a major concern for approximately 5 million 
members of labor unions and employees of companies represented by 
his group 
the argument most raised by phillips and others is that pentagon 
might be unable to get necessary components for its weapons systems 
if foreign supplies are cut off 
the general consensus is we are becoming dependent on foreign 
sources for some very important pieces of our military hardware 
phillips said in an interview last week 
the questions are how dependent how fast and whether or not 
that dependency is leading to a critical vulnerability if we lose 
that foreign source he said 
but former defense secretary frank c carlucci in congressional 
hearings last month cautioned lawmakers that strict protectionist 
legislation would invite retaliation from us trading partners 
it could be disastrous to our national security if we assume 
we can go it alone technologically carlucci said 
the house banking finance and urban affairs subcommittee on 
economic stabilization is weighing amendments to the law that would 
require the president to limit foreign participation in defense 
manufacturing and provide financial assistance to mediumsize and 
small us companies 
the measure sponsored by rep mary rose oakar dohio would 
limit products for new and existing weapons to those from 
manufacturers and assembly plants in the united states the practice 
would be phased in over five years 
if the president decided to waive the usproducts only 
requirement the administration would have to report to congress on 
the effect to the us industrial base and detail the costs of 
buying overseas 
the subcommittee approved similar legislation last year but the 
bill never made it to the house floor for a vote 
while the house considers oakars measures the senate banking 
committee is weighing legislation sponsored by dixon aimed more at 
internal reform within the pentagon 
specifically dixons measure calls for appointing the defense 
secretary to the economic policy council and creating a defense 
working group within the council it also would establish a defense 
production act fund for projects geared to developing new technology

carlito caparas has spent 11 years 
behind bars wondering whether he will ever be convicted or acquitted 
of the charge that landed him in jail 
a firstyear college student when he was jailed caparas now 34 
is among thousands of filipinos who wait for years in jail as their 
cases drag through a judiciary system bogged down by inefficiency 
and corruption 
lack of public confidence in the fair administration of justice 
contributes to disillusionment with government and helps fuel the 
20year communist insurgency military and civilian officials 
believe 
the breakdown in the judiciary has reached such a crisis that 
president corazon aquino on friday threatened to fire justice 
secretary sedfrey ordonez and others in his department if they 
cannot clear up the mess by the end of the year 
nothing impairs the credibility of government more than the 
common perception that we have two standards of justice one for the 
poor and another for the rich and powerful she said in the 
statement 
i am now placing all of you under probation she said at 
the end of the year we will assess your performance as individuals 
and a department if i am not satisfied i will not hesitate to 
exercise my power to remove appointees 
by the end of 1988 more than 15000 people were in jail 
nationwide government figures show of those 90 percent were 
waiting for their trials or appeals to end 
our jails are bursting at the seams said brig gen arsenio 
concepcion chief of jail management for the integrated national 
police therefore we cannot blame the prisoners if some of them 
go crazy 
most recent figures show that more than 300000 civil and 
criminal cases are backlogged in the countrys nearly 2000 courts 
not counting the 9500 cases pending before the supreme court 
about 350000 new cases are filed each year many take up to 10 
years to be resolved in an effort to clear the docket overworked 
judges often hear cases for only a few minutes then postpone them to 
take up anothers 
the experience of caparas serves as an example of the slow and 
ineffective administration of philippine justice 
caparas claims he was arrested for rape in 1978 after fraternity 
brothers used his apartment for sex with a woman but his trial did 
not begin until 1982 at least five judges heard his case before 
fire at the manila city hall destroyed court records in 1984 
after a fiveyear break caparas was summoned to court in april 
but the judge postponed the case again after learning that the 
arresting officer had disappeared the doctor who examined the woman 
had died and the victim herself had emigrated to canada 
officials blame the chaos on the breakdown on corruption of the 
judiciary under ousted president ferdinand marcos when mrs aquino 
took office three years ago she replaced numerous judges and 
restored a measure of judicial independence 
like any organization we have our share of misfits said 
supreme court chief justice marcelo fernan we try our best to 
weed them out as fast as we can but there are still a few rascals 
left who are giving the entire judiciary a bad name 
early in her term mrs aquino established a commission of 
legislative judicial and executive branch officials to draft 
reforms 
fernan has designated 84 courts for a continual trial project 
to speed up cases under the project litigants must agree to finish 
presenting evidence within 90 days 
in september ordonez ordered prosecutors to finish pretrial 
investigations within 60 days if they dont meet the deadline they 
dont get paid in may 200 prosecutors received their salaries late 
because of delays in pretrial investigations 
i stress to the judges that this is our last chance to prove to 
the people that they can get justice from us that they dont have 
to take the law into their own hands fernan said

nicholas hastings a british journalist for 
apdow jones a joint venture of the associated press and dow jones 
and co was aboard the marchioness when it sank in the river 
thames here is his account 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
london it was a perfect night for a party on the river and an 
unusually warm night which is probably what saved my life 
i had met with some friends and boarded the marchioness at 
charing cross pier as guests of a friend who had chartered the boat 
for his birthday party 
i was standing outside on the bow talking with my friends we 
had been sailing for about 20 minutes and we were laughing at 
various buildings we passed saying how awful they looked when 
suddenly there was a small jolt 
somebody screamed 
the first thing that ran through my mind was that we had hit 
something in the river but as i turned around i could see the 
enormous looming hull of the dredger that had hit us it was right 
on top of us 
as i did that somebody else yelled were going over and 
thats exactly what it did in a matter of seconds 
i was extremely lucky as i was standing on the lefthand side of 
the bow and the boat rolled to the right and as the boat rolled i 
was able to clamber over the hull and eventually found myself 
standing bonedry on top of the overturned keel 
i was the only person i could see everybody else had disappeared 
under the boat including two friends i was standing with 
i knew that my standing outside was what probably saved my life 
a colder day may have driven me below deck those below deck on the 
dance floor must have been dragged down with the marchioness 
but all of a sudden i realized that the boat was rocking back up 
slightly the first thought that came to my mind was that at least 
the others on board are going to be able to get out now but i 
realized it meant that i had to jump which i did 
i bobbed up some yards away from the boat and discovered myself 
being swept along in the very strong tidal current i realized there 
was no landing point nearby i knew i couldnt afford to go with the 
flow and decided to strike out for what appeared to be two moored 
barges and a glitter of a little patch of mud across the river 
luckily im a regular swimmer i jettisoned my glasses decided i 
didnt have time to get rid of my shoes 
after what seemed like a very long time i finally hit what felt 
like the bottom i stood in kneehigh water for the first time and 
what had been an eerie silence became the swiftly receding screams 
for help of the other passengers 
i then started shouting because i realized i couldnt get up the 
riverbank wall two police launches passed i screamed one stopped 
as if it had heard me then sped off again a man passed in a tiny 
skiff and didnt hear me 
by that stage i was fairly frantic id been in the water 10 or 
15 minutes and was getting cold 
i then saw two security guards from a building across the river 
running across the bridge they finally heard my shouts or caught 
sight of me 
they lowered a ladder and pulled me out of the water

the united states and the soviet union are the 
closest theyve been in 21 years of efforts to an agreement on the 
first treaty banning chemical weapons us officials and 
armscontrol groups say 
no breakthrough is imminent but a lot of hurdles have been 
cleared and it now looks like a treaty is possible if we can keep on 
getting agreement said a state department official speaking last 
week on condition of anonymity 
little progress on a chemical weapons treaty between the two 
superpowers had been reported until last month when the soviets 
moved toward the us position on verification and the destruction 
of existing weapons stockpiles 
the focus shifts to the latest round of talks which resumed 
thursday in geneva and are expected to last 10 days talks began in 
1968 
i think there is reason to be optimistic although a number of 
details have to be worked out and with a treaty like this the 
important stuff is in the details said lee feinstein of the arms 
control association a private group which monitors global arms 
control efforts 
john isaacs speaking for the council for a livable world agreed 
i believe chances are pretty good for a treaty in the next 
year said isaacs whose nonprofit arms control group has often 
been critical of the reagan and bush administrations the bush 
administration is pushing for it and there seems to be support in 
both countries 
one major impetus was the extensive use by iraq of chemical 
weapons 
iraq used chemical weapons in its recent war with iran a 
conflict that ended a year ago with a ceasefire iraq reportedly 
use mustard gas and nerve gas both against iran and against its own 
kurdish minority 
the war renewed attention on gas weapons which had not been 
extensively used since world war i 
although only the united states and the soviets admit to having 
chemical weapons cia officials have told congress they believe that 
15 to 20 nations possess the weapons 
chemical weapons were first used in world war i by germany they 
were widely used by both sides and caused more than 13 million 
casualties a 1925 treaty bans the first use of chemical weapons 
although not their possession 
the ussoviet talks are taking place amid the 40nation 
conference on disarmament in geneva there is no guarantee that 
other countries will accept any deal worked out by the two 
superpowers said feinstein 
but gordon burk of the federation of american scientists another 
nonprofit group which has been critical of the past two 
administrations said he thinks a ussoviet treaty can be sold to 
other nations 
if the soviets and the united states agree that they want 
something and show a strong will they can twist some arms he 
said 
in recent months the soviets have generally been more upbeat 
than the united states about prospects for a treaty after the last 
round of talks soviet officials said a treaty could be reached by 
the end of this year while us officials said only that the talks 
had been productive 
a major problem in verifying compliance is that many of the 
chemical components used in weapons can be produced in a variety of 
plants such as facilities built for fertilizers or pharmaceuticals 
one verification plan proposed by the united states and accepted 
by the soviets involves surprise inspections of sites either side 
suspected of being used to make gas weapons 
the soviets had previously opposed such inspections but abruptly 
changed their stance now the two sides have to work out details 
such as whether observers from the challenging nation would be 
allowed to witness the inspection according to us officials 
involved in the talks speaking on condition of anonymity 
another unresolved question involves destruction of existing 
stockpiles and production facilities the officials said 
another hurdle is an exchange of data by both sides about the 
size of location of each countrys stockpile according to the 
officials although the size of the us stockpile is classified it 
is believed to be about 25000 tons 
the soviets claim to have 50000 tons although us officials 
say the soviets may have up to 300000 tons 
any treaty would have to be ratified by the senate but the pact 
has wide support in the democraticcontrolled congress 
last month the house voted 4144 approval of a resolution 
calling for a global ban recently 75 of 100 senators signed a 
letter urging president bush to push for a treaty

a rare earthquake rattled northwestern 
alabama and parts of tennessee toppling books from shelves 
slightly damaging at least two homes and startling residents unused 
to tremors 
the mild quake which registered 39 on the richter scale struck 
at 703 pm saturday and was centered 15 miles south of this town 
of 37000 according to the national earthquake information center 
in golden colo 
police switchboards lit up with calls after the shaker but there 
were no reports of injuries according to officials in several 
jurisdictions 
the ground trembled said le woody of florence who was 
sitting on his patio when he realized the rumbling was something 
more than a thunderstorm it felt like the concrete and all moved 
under my feet 
reports of shaking came from colbert and lauderdale counties in 
alabamas northwest corner and from around lawrenceburg tenn near 
the alabama line 
two homeowners in colbert county reported damage cracked bricks 
on one home and a crack in the basement of the other said eddy 
hicks the state emergency management coordinator for the area 
in lauderdale county books fell from shelves said george 
mangum the alabama emergency management agencys local director 
the temblor was felt in iron city tenn just north of the 
alabama line said joanna kennemer communications operator at the 
tennessee highway patrol office in lawrenceburg 
police departments in northwest alabama were inundated with 
telephone calls 
people said it shook their house and their windows real bad 
said muscle shoals police officer donald coon 34 experiencing his 
first earthquake it sounded like a big explosion and then the 
ground shook for two or three seconds you could feel it coming 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight damage 
in the local area and a 4magnitude quake can do moderate local 
damage

the foreseeable future 
its almost like being on a ship of discovery like marco polo 
magellan and columbus said jurrie van der woude a jpl spokesman 
for most of us this is the last picture show the last foreign 
shores we visit in the solar system 
only a few days and a few million miles remain until 859 pm 
pdt thursday when voyager makes its closest approach to neptune by 
skirting 3000 miles above the planets cloudtops much closer than 
its encounters with jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus in 
1986 
as of 9 am pdt monday voyager 2 will be 2743 billion miles 
from earth and 3211 million miles from neptune approaching the 
planet at 42310 mph since it was launched in 1977 voyager 2 has 
traveled a curving path totaling 44 billion miles 
with a final course correction monday morning nasa engineers 
will put voyager 2 on its precise trajectory for the neptune flyby 
sending voyager to neptune was like sinking a 2260mile golf 
putt assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments 
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green says 
the voyager neptune travel guide by mission planning manager 
charles kohlhase and his staff 
up to 8000 photographs from voyagers two television cameras and 
discoveries by 10 other science experiments will pour in so quickly 
that the national aeronautics and space administration will conduct 
daily news conferences starting monday and continuing through aug 
29 
by late last week voyager had already revealed some of neptunes 
secrets including 
four previously unknown moons in addition to nereid and 
backwardorbiting triton which were discovered from earth voyager 
is likely to discover more moons 
clouds and other weather features including 2700milewide 
bands similar to jet streams on earth and a 8100by4100mile 
dark spot probably a huge storm like jupiters great red spot 
two partial rings of debris called ring arcs that are much 
different from the complete rings that encircle saturn and uranus 
scientists say there may be 50 or more ring arcs orbiting neptune 
a magnetic field surrounding neptune suggesting the planet also 
may have auroras like earths northern lights and may be enveloped 
by orbiting radiation belts similar to earths van allen belts 
the neptune encounter is the climax of the 865 million 
twinspacecraft voyager mission which also saw voyager 1 explore 
jupiter in 1979 and saturn in 1980 
haynes said mondays course correction will assure voyager 2 can 
aim a radio signal at earth when the probe starts to pass behind 
neptune 
ellis miner deputy project scientist said by measuring changes 
in the signal scientists hope to determine neptunes atmospheric 
pressures temperatures and chemical makeup whether ring arcs are 
made of dust sand pebbles or boulders and how material is 
distributed inside neptune 
the radio experiment takes all of voyagers radio signal 
strength so no other data or photographs will be sent back to earth 
for about 2 hours around the time of close encounter miner said 
when voyager sends pictures and data to earth they take four hours 
and six minutes to arrive even traveling at the speed of light 
186000 miles per second 
during its closest encounter with neptune voyager will pass over 
the planets north pole which will be cloaked in winter darkness 
six minutes later voyager will start a 49minute trip through 
neptunes shadow instead of photographing neptune during those 
times the spacecraft will make other measurements and snap pictures 
of any ring arcs and of one of the newly discovered moons

for months the jury heard gruesome details of 
violent death from grieving survivors then murder struck one of the 
night stalker jurors and the nightmarish stories hit home 
phyllis singletary who had served with her fellow jurors for 
more than a year was gone shot to death by her livein boyfriend 
who later committed suicide 
the murder created an unprecedented legal and emotional dilemma 
many of the jurors wept openly when they heard the news tuesday and 
defense lawyers worried about how closely jurors would connect the 
death in their midst with the charges they were weighing against 
richard ramirez 
ramirez 29 a shaggyhaired drifter from el paso texas is 
accused of being the devil worshiping night stalker a serial 
killer whose rampage of murder rape and robbery terrorized southern 
california in the summer of 1985 many of his victims were shot to 
death 
defense attorney ray g clark asked that deliberations be 
suspended to let jurors absorb the shock of ms singletarys death 
he feared that jurors might vent their anger on ramirez because 
hes their only target 
but superior court judge michael tynan had one overriding 
priority to bring the long trial to a conclusion he sent in an 
alternate to replace ms singletary and after one day off he 
allowed deliberations to begin anew 
deputy district attorney p philip halpin who had struggled to 
keep the 4yearold prosecution case on track supported tynans 
decision 
it really is our responsibility here to look to the living and 
carry this thing forward he said 
it was not the first disruption of deliberations on friday aug 
11 after 12 days behind closed doors the foreman sent the judge a 
note one of the jurors he reported had been sleeping during their 
talks 
tynan interviewed panelists about the problem then decided to 
dismiss the sleepy juror and replace him with an alternate under 
the law this meant starting deliberations all over again 
on monday only 11 jurors showed up 
ms singletary 30 a pacific bell employee failed to appear 
when she didnt answer her phone by midday the judge sent sheriffs 
deputies to her home they found her dead shot twice in the chest 
after being beaten 
within a day her boyfriend james melton 51 was dead by his 
own hand after writing a suicide note in which he admitted killing 
ms singletary he put a gun to his temple and shot himself 
beyond the immediate tragedy was the question of what to do about 
the night stalker trial should a mistrial be declared 
attorneys searched through law books but couldnt find that 
anything similar had happened before 
the law is scant on this issue reported clark and the judge 
agreed he decided to seek guidance from the jury foreman 
on wednesday foreman felipe rodriguez told tynan that the jurors 
were calm and ready to go forward 
everyone appears to have put it behind them he said 
tynan then called the jury before him and stressed that they 
should not confuse the killing of ms singletary with the murders 
charged against ramirez 
please understand that none of this had anything to do with 
whether mr ramirez is guilty or innocent of these charges tynan 
told them 
we must get on with the task that life has given us he 
said no matter how deeply you feel about her death it is in no 
way connected to the case of richard ramirez 
with that the panel recessed and began its deliberations for the 
third time behind closed doors it was to resume deliberations 
monday following its weekend off

released sunday by the revolutionary justice organization it was 
translated into english by the associated press bureau in beirut 
 
in the name of the almighty 
to the spiteful rulers of france who are chronically forgetting 
once again france enters the east as an enemy of the oppressed 
people and unmasks its treacherous face at a time when we imagined 
it has learnt from the bitter past and will not repeat the 
experiment 
but recent events have proven that frances rulers have forgotten 
the lessons and still insist on following the american criminal 
policies aimed at confronting the rightful aspirations of the 
persecuted people in the region 
the revolutionary justice organization which has pledged itself 
to the defense of the rights of the oppressed will not allow france 
to intervene in the region under any pretext it also declares the 
following 
1 we serve a clearcut warning the depth of the french 
strategic security will be a stage of our options 
2 our responses will not be confined to directly related areas 
because all means of pressure are available and all options are open 
3 america which is spurring france on should realize that any 
foolhardiness by the french fleet will expose the life of its 
hostages to danger therefore this factor should be taken into 
consideration 
victory for the oppressed in the march of liberation and justice 
glory and immortality for the martyrs

visit to poland and said he will raise the issue of a roman catholic 
convent that has angered jews because it is next to the auschwitz 
concentration camp 
the weeklong trip by religious affairs minister zevulun hammer 
is the first official visit by an israeli minister since the two 
countries restored diplomatic ties in 1986 poland severed ties in 
1967

and preservation of jewish synagogues cemeteries and holy books 
of course there is a subject that is creating an uproar in the 
jewish world the carmelite convent issue in auschwitz and i hope 
to discuss the issue both with the authorities and the church he 
said 
jewish groups consider the presence of christian symbols at the 
auschwitz camp a desecration of the memory of jews killed in the 
nazi holocaust an estimated 25 million jews were among the four 
million people muredred at the camp during world war ii 
under an accord signed by catholic and jewish leaders in 1987 
the nuns were supposed to have moved by feb 22 to a prayer center 
to be built several thousand yards away 
 
the deadline passed and the new center has yet to be built 
zevulun orlev a senior religious affairs ministry official 
said hammer would meet krakow cardinal franciszek macharski who is 
in charge of the convent and will explain morally that the 
auschwitz death camp is first and foremost a jewish site

auschwitz at the hands of nazi doctor joseph mengele are now in 
poland accompanied by four israeli legislators they plan to visit

members of the united democratic 
front and seven other banned antiapartheid groups unfurled their 
banners at a cathedral sunday and declared they would defy 
government emergency laws by operating openly again 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu led a multiracial congregation 
of 2500 in chanting no to apartheid no to injustice no to 
oppression and no to racism at the church service which replaced 
a planned rally at the mixedrace university of the western cape 
police prevented that rally from taking place 
the declarations by the antiapartheid groups some of which took 
place in johannesburg are part of a national defiance campaign 
organized to coincide with the sixth birthday of the 700group 
united democratic front antiapartheid coalition 
they aim to challenge the government in the weeks before the 
sept 6 parliamentary elections which exclude the black majority 
organizers in cape town obtained a lastminute supreme court 
order forbidding police from interfering with the rally at the 
cathedral 
but a similar rally in johannesburg also banned was thwarted 
when police blockaded main entrances to the white university of the 
witwatersrand about 200 protesters slipped through and held a rally 
addressed by littleknown spokesmen who refused to identify 
themselves but declared the united democratic front and five 
affiliate organizations unbanned 
after the johannesburg rally ended about 50 black youths chanted 
and danced on the campus lawn until police moved in with batons and 
dispersed them the independent south african press association 
quoted an unidentified foreign diplomat as saying police injured 
several of the youths and arrested about 20 
sources close to antiapartheid leaders said many of those in 
johannesburg had gone into hiding friday after police detained 
mohammed valli moosa acting general secretary of the united 
democratic front under emergency regulations that allow them to 
hold a suspect indefinitely without charge 
valli moosa was a principal organizer of the defiance campaign 
which involves challenges to segregation at beaches hospitals in 
parks buses and schools 
a mobile emergency medical clinic was on standby outside the 
cathedral in case of injuries from police action but because of the 
court order the police remained two blocks away sitting in parked 
vans however they set up a roadblock on the main highway into cape 
town and stopped a busload of people from attending the rally 
police also prevented students from leaving the campus of the 
university of the western cape 
referring to a police attack saturday on hundreds of blacks 
attempting to picnic on whitesonly cape peninsula beaches tutu 
said they say apartheid is dead it is one of the most 
extraordinary corpses around 
they had police dogs and tear gas to stop people from walking 
on gods beaches i have never been more proud of people who are 
involved in the struggle for justice and freedom in this country 
than yesterday it is our country and we are claiming what is 
ours he said 
the banner of each organization was unfurled as the group was 
pronounced unbanned 
zoli malindi leader of the united democratic front in western 
cape province defied restrictions which prohibit him from 
addressing a gathering he declared 
the united democratic front is unbanned and will continue as if 
it has never been banned 
representatives of the organizations holding the banners aloft 
marched outside the church and then dispersed after the 2hour 
service

solidarity has scored a spectacular coup by 
gaining control of the government barely four months after its 
legalization unseating a communist party entrenched for 45 years 
but the opposition movement that refused to perish under the tank 
tracks of martial law may be facing its greatest challenge yet 
it must try to solve the intractable polish economic puzzle with 
inexperienced people in its ranks and a hostile communist party at 
its side and to solve that economic puzzle it must take unpopular 
steps that will tend to alienate its bedrock of support the polish 
worker 
for the second time in its history solidarity is entering a 
course that may toss its ship on the rocks activist jerzy 
jedlicki wrote in the oppositions gazeta wyborcza last week 
it is very risky said union spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz on 
the night that solidarity editor tadeusz mazowiecki was nominated 
prime minister 
without a doubt the polish opposition has gone farther than ever 
before in loosening the hold on power of the polish united workers 
party but it will have to step very gingerly against enormous odds 
to keep the clock from turning back again 
in a bow to geopolitical realities solidarity leader lech walesa 
declared in advance of mazowieckis nomination that the key 
ministries of defense and interior will stay headed by communists 
presumably the soviet union polands superpower neighbor would 
not have acquiesced to anything less 
that means that what opposition spokesmen call the forces of 
coercion the army and the police will remain entirely in the 
hands of the party 
jedlicki arguing against the opposition taking the government 
said that in any situation when the party senses it is in mortal 
danger it will still have the means to mobilize a counterattack 
another martial law 
every decision that mazowiecki takes as prime minister will have 
to be weighed against this threat 
for instance how fast can he move to dismantle communist control 
of the stateowned mass media will the solidarity economic minister 
be able to order a cut in defense spending or look into secret 
police budgets does a decision to fire thousands of party workers 
risk a reaction 
it will be a delicate calculation especially because mazowiecki 
will be under pressure from society to move quickly especially in 
the realm of the economy 
mazowiecki got a foretaste sunday of what he can expect 
we need bread not a premier militant hecklers chanted at his 
first public appearance after being nominated 
if mazowiecki does not bring fast results in improving the 
material situation in poland not even his affiliation with walesa 
and solidarity will protect him from public anger 
solidarity always more moderate at the top than some of its 
members itself will face sharp competition from the 
communistlinked official union known as opzz which will press 
economic demands at every opportunity in a bid to win a following 
solidarity can anticipate being torn between workers who demand 
that the union protect their jobs and living standards and 
mazowieckis need as prime minister to moderate wage growth and 
close wasteful unprofitable state enterprises to improve the 
economy 
the government will be the focus of all expectations of the 
rallying society and it will have to disappoint it because there 
is no wonder drug to cure polands economy jedlicki wrote 
the polish economy is in a tailspin inflation is over 100 
percent and climbing the government budget deficit this year 
approaches 1 billion and the 39 billion foreign debt is among the 
highest in the world agricultural and industrial production are 
falling mainly the result of crumbling infrastructures and the 
flight of much of the workforce abroad 
on the maninthestreet level shops are empty telephones and 
public transportation increasingly do not work and hours of 
productive time daily are wasted in obtaining or organizing the 
necessities of life whether medicine for a sick child or gasoline 
for commuting to work 
in this atmosphere of descending cataclysm the communist party 
for years had been trying to persuade the opposition to accept 
coresponsibility for polands fate 
by handing solidarity the prime ministers job it may have 
succeeded 
onyszkiewicz would have preferred to wait before the opposition 
entered government but he admits solidarity finally had no choice 
with the communist party so discredited the country was suffering a 
leadership vacuum he said 
but the union will be handicapped by a lack of people who have 
practical experience in government he said 
in fact the government will continue to include tens of thousands 
of loyal party members who will have little incentive to see that 
solidarity succeeds 
nevertheless solidarity has a few trumps it can play 
first theres its ability to marshal public enthusiasm as 
demonstrated in the incredible whirlwind election campaign that saw 
it winning all but one of the 261 pariliament seats it was allowed 
to contest 
second is its close ties to the west financial assistance 
promised during the visit to poland in july of president bush was 
only 1 percent of what solidarity requested 
but perhaps the west will be somewhat more generous to ensure the 
survival of the first noncommunist regime in the east bloc

fort worth zoo officials still arent 
sure what sex their new baby rhino is but they know its 
significance 
the 100pound black rhinoceros calf is the first born under a 
program designed to save the species from extinction through captive 
breeding and biologists hope it will be the first of many born on 
us zoos and ranches 
the baby is about the size of a large dog and has a bump on its 
nose that will later grow into a large horn it was closely tended 
by its mother ngwete one of 10 black rhinos brought to the united 
states last month from zimbabwe 
ngwete gave birth friday evening and the event was immediately 
hailed as a milestone in the effort to try to preserve the species 
its wonderful said harry tennison who organized the 
shipment of black rhinos to breeding programs in the united states 
i already have a name for it tennison said id like to 
call it lucky because of how lucky we are to have it 
fort worth zoo director elvie turner jr said the baby is 
healthy but that experts wont be able to determine its sex for 
some time 
turner said he was considering naming the rhino harry after 
tennison if it turns out to be male 
maybe well call it lucky harry he said

irans parliament on sunday rejected a 
motion to fire an industry minister for failing to prevent fraud at 
a state automobile plant official iranian reports said 
the parliament also questioned interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi a leading hardliner dropped from a newly proposed 
cabinet the reports said they gave no details on what he was 
asked however 
the new president hashemi rafsanjani dropped mohtashemi from his 
proposed list of cabinet members in an effort to keep antiwestern 
radicals out of government and install a team of more pragmatic 
technocrats 
heavy industries mininister behzad nabavi was also dropped from 
that list however his early ouster by parliament would have been 
the first time the body fired a minister 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
said 123 deputies voted in favor of dropping the noconfidence 
motion against nabavi with 73 voting for it and 21 abstentions 
opponents of the motion criticized a parliamentary inquiry that 
concluded nabavi had effectively aided the scandal at the automobile 
plant by not acting swiftly against it the agency said 
the call for his dismissal came in a 60page report resulting 
from the inquiry the report was signed by four parliamentary 
deputies the agency said 
nabavi 47 has served in the cabinet since 1980 
the eighthour debate in the parliament or majlis replaced a 
planned discussion of rafsanjanis proposed 22member cabinet each 
proposed member must be approved by a majority of deputies 
the official news agency quoted a deputy from the northern 
azerbaijan province habib borumand as sayig mohtashemi had 
violated majlis regulations by failing to show up within 20 days to 
answer the queries 
however the majority of parlementarians have supported 
mohtashemi in the past on friday more than 138 deputies submitted 
a petition asking the new president considered the leader of the 
rival pragmatist faction to reinstate the hardliner 
according to the news agency the attacks on nabavi stem from the 
conviction of nine people for embezzling 360 million they were 
found guilty of illegally selling cars made at the saipa plant on 
the black market and overcharging for cars ordered by government 
organizations 
the factorys former director touraj mansour was fined about 
170 million and sentenced to 70 lashes as well as a suspended 
eightyear jail term 
the plant which manufactures cars under license from the french 
renault company is operated by the heavy industries ministry 
however nabavi told the majlis on sunday that he was really 
under attack for other reasons such as his support for government 
rationing of basic goods the news agency said 
this is not the way to treat a minister just a week before he 
completes nine years of serving in the cabinet he was quoted as 
saying 
the agency said the noconfidence motion was defeated after 
questions were raised about the parliamentary inquirys 
objectiveness lack of evidence linking nabavi with the fraud and 
his reputation as one of the governments most competent ministers

at the time i thought the party would serve through a 
parliamentary campaign would enact land reforms literacy programs 
social services and provide social justice to a variety of ethnic 
groups zarif said but unfortunately its real actions brought 
about exactly the opposite 
he indicated he had information that could breach najibs 
security but refused to say whether he had given it to the 
usbacked rebels called mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
zarif said the presidents personal security staff included two 
soviet advisers who dealt mainly with technical and communications 
problems 
he claimed military morale in afghanistan was low despite the 
guerrillas failure to capture a major city since the feb 15 
completion of the withdrawal of some 103000 soviet combat troops 
zarif said the guerrillas stalled offensive on the eastern city 
of jalalabad which began march 6 was not typical of afghan 
defenses 
najib concentrated all military attention toward jalalabad 
there was a continual resupply he said adding that military 
units were deployed from elsewhere in the country to defend the city 
zarif said he doubted the guerrillas would meet the same response 
if they were to attack other governmentheld cities including kabul 
the capital 
his appearance marked the opening of the media information 
department of islamic afghanistan a public relations unit of the 
mujahedeens own selfproclaimed government in exile 
the usbacked rebels the most powerful of which are based in 
the pakistani frontier city of peshawar are fighting to topple the 
sovietbacked kabul regime and establish an islamic republic of 
afghanistan 
communist forces hold the capital and most of afghanistans key 
cities but mujahedeen control most of the countryside 
the guerrillas recently have stepped up rocket attacks on kabul 
reportedly with new multihead missiles supplied by the united 
states 
soviet forces entered afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the marxist 
government and fight the rebellion moscow agreed to withdraw last 
year under a un accord and completed the troop pullout in february 
western diplomats predicted that the rebels who control much of 
the countryside would overrun major cities in a matter of months 
but government forces supplied with soviet arms have managed to 
rebuff rebel attacks

another barrier fell to glasnost sunday as the 
soviets revealed to their own people and the rest of the world the 
deadliest weapon in their air force arsenal the needlenosed 
strategic bomber nato calls the blackjack 
plagued by a chain of recent mishaps including plane crashes and 
the highly publicized defection of a fighter pilot the soviet air 
force may have needed some good publicity 
in a dazzling threehour air show the countrys first in more 
than 20 years it aimed to show soviet and foreign doubters that it 
still very much has the right stuff 
although western air attaches who attended said they saw little 
that was new the aviationsports holiday was clearly in line 
with the policy of glasnost or openness pursued by the kremlin 
under president mikhail s gorbachev which has also brought an 
easing of the onceobsessive secrecy about military affairs 
assembled on the grass at tushino airfield in moscows northwest 
more than 150000 people saw the supersonic blackjack bomber known 
here as the tupolev 160 streak by along with other aeronautics 
novelties like the pontoonwinged a40 floating amphibious rescue 
plane the ilyushin 96300 jetliner and the tupolev204 called the 
soviet version of the boeing 757 by westerners 
the blackjack which the pentagon says is the largest and 
heaviest bomber in the world flashed out of the north over tushino 
at a height of only 8001000 feet its four thundering jet engines 
leaving a yellow smudge of exhaust behind in the sky 
flying at about 380 mph the plane whose nose resembles that of 
the concorde supersonic jetliner shot past the airfield in seconds 
then peeled off towards the south and the highrise towers of a 
moscow residential district 
despite its nato designation the plane was painted a dazzling 
white 
according to the pentagons 1988 study soviet military power 
the bomber has a maximum speed of mach 2 twice the speed of sound 
or more than 1300 mph and an unrefueled combat range of about 
4500 miles it reportedly can carry payloads of bombs or 
airlaunched cruise missiles 
thenus defense secretary frank carlucci was invited to inspect 
a blackjack bomber at kubinka air base near moscow in august 1988 
and saw it fly but sundays flight was the first before the general 
public 
the official tass news agency called the blackjacks flight the 
main event of the air show which it said was attended by 
politburo members nikolai n slyunkov and viktor m chebrikov and 
the soviet defense minister dmitri t yazov 
according to janes all the worlds aircraft 19889 the 
soviets are expected to build at least 100 blackjacks at a new 
complex in kazan eleven had been completed by 1988 janes said 
the logic of developing and deploying the bomber came under fire 
in the weekly magazine ogonyok which again proved that taboos about 
criticizing the soviet defense establishment are much less 
restrictive under gorbachev 
ogonyok said the tu160 project began long ago as a 
forcedthough expensive measure to reciprocate for the us 
decision to build the b1b bomber 
each blackjack costs the soviet people millions of rubles 
the magazine said 
the tushino air show the soviets first since 1967 was 
officially held to celebrate aviation day marked every aug 20 the 
shows cost was pegged by soviet officials at 800000 rubles 12 
million 
western air attaches suggested that one purpose of the show may 
have been to give the soviet people a more favorable image of their 
air force they said that may have been necessary to counter recent 
mishaps and problems 
in july a pilotless mig23 flew halfway across europe and 
crashed in belgium killing an 18yearold man after its soviet air 
force pilot ejected over poland 
the previous month a mig29 fighter crashed at the prestigious 
paris air show a joint sovietfrench commission established that a 
bird had been sucked into the engine causing the crash earlier 
this year a soviet pilot defected to turkey in a mig29

west german authorities said sunday 
that at least 90 bullets were fired across the border into east 
germany in a mysterious incident that has aggravated relations 
between the two nations 
authorities said they had no clues of the identity or number of 
assailants in the incident that occurred early friday nor did they 
know what motivated the attack 
shots from the west german side of the werra river were fired for 
more than an hour in the early morning hitting two houses and a 
barn in the east german border town of wahlhausen according to the 
east german adn news agency 
a police spokesman in this west german border town about 130 
miles east of bonn said sunday that 90 smallcaliber bullet casings 
were found at the nearby werra river he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
no one was injured in the incident but it has added another 
strain in relations with communist east germany 
east germany filed an official protest in bonn on friday calling 
the incident an extraordinarily provocative attack the protest 
said the incident seriously endangered the life and health of the 
regions residents as well as members of the east german border 
guards 
eschwege police said they might have caught the attackers if east 
german authorities had informed them of the incident sooner 
we dont understand why the east german border guards didnt 
activate an alarm one policeman said sunday then we could have 
intercepted the assailants 
adn said east german leader erich honecker dispatched the 
regional communist party chief to wahlhausen to console the two 
families whose homes were damaged 
one of the residents egbert jost suggested to the news agency 
that west german border guards were negligent in not preventing the 
attack or the escape of the attackers 
the agency quoted jost calling the incident the worst 
provocation on the west german border since the end of world war 
ii 
reinhold feige a 75yearold retiree whose granddaughter was in 
the home when it was fired on called the attack indescribably 
cruel

federal prosecutors are investigating a 
west german company suspected of purchasing sensitive us nuclear 
technology and shipping it to pakistan and india a us magazine 
said in a report available sunday 
the ntg neue technologien firm of gelnhausen has been under 
investigation for suspected illegal exports since last year and 
investigators plan to ask for help from the us justice department 
according to nuclear fuel a biweekly magazine published by 
mcgrawhill inc 
the article prepared by the magazines bonn office was to appear 
in mondays edition but it was released in advance to news agencies 
in bonn on sunday 
the investigative arm of the us congress the general 
accounting office earlier this month released a report saying 
foreign countries are gaining access to us government technology 
that could help them develop atomic weapons it blamed the problem 
on conflicting laws and erratic enforcement 
the report singled out pakistan which is suspected of working 
secretly to develop nuclear weapons and india which detonated a 
nuclear device in 1974 
the magazine quoting unidentified sources involved in the 
investigation said ntg systematically sought and in some cases 
obtained technology from us companies for nuclearrelated 
programs in pakistan and india over the past few years it said 
the exports were illegal 
it said ntg officials had refused to respond to its report 
the associated press called ntgs office in gelnhausen about 20 
miles east of frankfurt but a recorded message said it was closed 
until monday 
there was also no answer sunday at the federal prosecutors 
office in hanau where the inquiry is being directed 
west german companies have repeatedly been accused over the past 
few years of engaging in sensitive or illegal trade 
the imhausenchemie firm of lahr has been under investigation 
this year on suspicion of outfitting a libyan plant that washington 
says can be used for making poison gas the case strained uswest 
german relations earlier this year 
in january the bonn government accused five other west german 
companies of helping iraq develop chemical weapons 
in its report nuclear fuel said ntg which has a representative 
in princeton nj bought two highpowered lasers in the united 
states and obtained export permission by saying they were for use in 
west germany 
the lasers were intended for use in the production of nuclear 
fuel the magazine said 
the us firm that sold ntg the lasers coherent general of 
sturbridge mass obtained an export permit for the sale on 
condition that ntg would use them itself and that the lasers would 
remain in west germany the magazine said 
shipment of such technology to the subcontinent would be outlawed 
under us commerce department regulations the magazine said it 
would also violate the international nuclear nonproliferation 
treaty 
the magazine said peter finke director of the ptb consulting 
firm affiliated with ntg told investigators he was repeatedly 
pressured by pakistani agents to acquire an entire range of 
nuclear technology including technology to produce a thermonuclear 
weapon 
nuclear fuel said the laser systems were shipped by ntg to 
frankfurt in december 1986 and reexported to margalla enterprises 
in karachi pakistan two weeks later margalla is a purchasing 
agent for the pakistan atomic energy commission nuclear fuel said 
the west german government office responsible for exports told 
nuclear fuel that ntg apparently shipped the lasers to pakistan 
without seeking a west german export permit 
nuclear fuel said it had examined financial records in west 
germany that showed the pakistani purchaser paid ntg 425000 
nearly three times the us sale price of the laser systems 
the magazine said ntg was also under investigation on suspicion 
of shipping us components for a reactor refueling machine to 
bombay india in 1987 
those parts were obtained by ntg from the imperial clevite corp 
of cleveland nuclear fuel said the magazine said clevite officials 
believed the parts were being procured for a canadian firm

investigators seeking the cause of a steam 
explosion that killed three people began sunday to reassemble the 
pipe that erupted under a manhattan street in a 15story geyser of 
400degree gas and mud 
a woman who was walking her dog was killed in the blast saturday 
night in the upperclass neighborhood as was a consolidated edison 
co worker on the scene a second con ed worker burned in the 
explosion at 20th street and third avenue died overnight 
authorities said 
at least 18 others were injured and hundreds of people were 
evacuated from apartments after the 630 pm explosion 
i actually saw the street rise said tom ritchford 27 who 
was with denise ozker 29 in a sidewalk cafe when the street 
erupted a few feet away when it came up i covered my face and 
stepped under the table and pulled denise under the table with me 
i thought this is it were going to die said ritchford 
who then fled with ozker when the water raining on them became 
warmer and warmer 
a con ed spokesman marty gitten said four workers were 
reopening a valve on the 24inch main when it exploded just three 
feet away the steam is produced as a byproduct of power generation 
and sold to buildings as a source of heat in some older buildings 
it is even used to power elevators 
con ed had turned off the steam main on saturday morning as the 
city repaired a water main leak on the same block 
it will take some time to figure out the cause of the 
explosion gitten said we have to literally put the pieces of 
damaged pipe back together and recreate the scene 
one possible cause gitten said was stress caused by cold water 
hitting the outside of the hot pipe pressure in the main was 150 
pounds per square inch and the steam was 400 degrees fahrenheit 
gitten said 
the pedestrian helen sauer and joseph malfatti a con ed 
worker were pronounced dead at bellevue hospital on saturday said 
hospital spokesman robert frazier 
con ed worker steven walsh died sunday morning in the burn center 
of new york hospitalcornell medical center said mary cialone a 
hospital administrator two other workers remained hospitalized 
there one in critical condition she said

most woodstockanniversary revelers left the 
site of the 1969 concert sunday ending a weeklong celebration and 
leaving behind the mud and memories of yesteryear as well as mounds 
of empty beer cans 
despite the lack of bigname entertainers the unsanctioned 
gathering swelled to 20000 as people came to mark the 20th 
anniversary of the rock n roll concert that has become a symbol of 
the 60s youth movement 
like its predecessor the celebration of the woodstock music and 
art festival was mostly peaceful but it was marred by a fight late 
saturday night in which a man was stabbed 
joseph basto 39 of newburgh ny was stabbed in the abdomen 
by an unidentified man at about 11 pm saturday according to 
sullivan county sheriff joseph wasser basto was reported in 
critical condition sunday at harris community general hospital 
wasser said no arrest has been made and police were still 
interviewing witnesses to the incident sunday 
when you have 15000 people you can have anything wasser 
said of the stabbing when you go into a bar with 20 people you 
can have an assault 
the gathering began early last week with a handful of people and 
mushroomed to about 20000 people friday night 
revelers were packing up their tents and makeshift camps and 
wasser said only about 3500 remained sunday in the sloping alfalfa 
field in the catskill mountains 110 miles northwest of new york 
city despite its name the festival actually took place in bethel 
about 50 miles southeast of woodstock 
as it was 20 years ago the late max yasgurs farm was turned 
into a muddy mess by celebrants and by a cold hard rain that began 
saturday evening and lasted into sunday morning 
about 400000 young people converged on the farm aug 1517 
1969 to listen to music by some of rock n rolls biggest stars 
local musicians supplied most of the entertainment this time 
although melanie who performed here 20 years ago showed up early 
friday morning and sang two songs on a makeshift stage 
the lack of bigname stars didnt discourage many celebrants 
though the town of bethel staunchly refused to sanction any 
organized event commemorating the concert traffic was backed up 
along several of the roads as people poured in to set up camp and 
party 
though there were about a dozen drugrelated arrests over the 
weekend alcohol mainly beer seemed to be the drug of choice 
among the crowd which ranged in age from 6 to 60 some brought 
kegs others hauled in truckloads of cases 
a lot of people here are heavy beer drinkers said joe rogers 
of queens drugs are rare 
crime was rare though someone did make off with rogers spare 
clothes leaving him standing in a cold rain wearing shorts a 
longsleeved shirt and running shoes he said he had 4 left to get 
him home 
its kind of disappointing it kind of misses the point of all 
this rogers said but he added i have never had so much fun 
in my life

two women accused of hijacking a helicopter and 
using it to pluck their husbands from a colorado prison yard say 
love made them do it 
what can i say i was blinded by love rebecca brown said 
with a shrug as she was being led in handcuffs friday night to a 
sheriffs car in holdrege neb where the foursome was captured 
after a nineminute gun battle 400 miles from the prison 
i love him enough to die for him said patricia gonzales in 
an interview with the rocky mountain news from the phelps county 
jail in holdrege 
friday morning the women forced a helicopter pilot at gunpoint 
to fly to the yard of the arkansas valley correctional facility in 
ordway and lift their husbands cellmates ralph brown 30 and 
freddie gonzales 21 to freedom authorities say 
one tower guard at the prison has been suspended and a second 
also faces a hearing for not heeding the wardens repeated radio 
calls to open fire on the helicopter 
guard russ ellis of pueblo who warden jim brittain said froze 
up at that ultimate moment of truth and another unnamed guard 
in the prisons other watchtower will face a hearing this week the 
second guard was not suspended 
colorado corrections officials said the tower guards could be 
fired or exonerated depending on what the probe shows 
nebraska officials say the four suspects likely will be charged 
with attempted murder aiding an attempted murder felony possession 
of firearms resisting arrest and use of a firearm in the commission 
of a felony 
us attorney mike norton in denver said he planned to file 
federal charges probably including air piracy on monday colorado 
officials have plans for escape charges 
mrs gonzales 41 maintains the escape attempt was the browns 
idea she said she got cold feet but was told by the browns she 
already was in too deep 
i did what i did because i felt i was really pressured i was 
scared what might happen to us she said my husband just wanted 
to be with me he only had 18 months left in prison but he wanted 
to be with me i am scared whats scaring me most is the separation 
from him 
mrs gonzales a grandmother with hearts tattooed on her chest 
used to work with prison inmates as a volunteer she met freddie 
gonzales 20 years her junior at a prison in canon city and married 
him by proxy earlier this year she was dismissed from her volunteer 
work for misusing her prison clearance 
she was assigning herself duties and times to be in the prison 
that were not only not approved but were inappropriate george 
sullivan deputy director of the colorado department of corrections 
said sunday 
he said she had been assigned to work with a case manager at the 
prison during the case managers hours but began showing up on 
weekends and during evening hours claiming she was tutoring inmates 
in a class 
mrs gonzales said she met mrs brown and they became friends 
during visiting days 
letters found where mrs gonzales was living near the prison 
showed she was really pining away for her husband said crowley 
county sheriff dale anderson she loved him so much she was 
really worried and scared 
he called mrs brown a very intelligent person and said she 
apparently approached mrs gonzales with the escape idea three weeks 
ago 
a mother of two small children mrs brown 26 married her 
husband a little more than a year ago mrs gonzales son jaime 
hernandez 19 called mrs brown a wild girl who always likes 
to have fun partying all the time 
the women rented the helicopter friday on the pretext of looking 
at real estate authorities said mrs gonzales said she was told to 
put a gun to the pilots head and order him to drop down into the 
prison 
my intentions were never to kill the pilot she said i was 
very scared i didnt even know how to hold the gun when everybody 
got in the helicopter they took the gun away from me i was shaking 
too much 
the pilot was tied up and left with the helicopter by an 
abandoned farmhouse and the escapees took off in a van police 
later discovered three 9mm semiautomatic pistols a 38caliber 
revolver and a 22caliber revolver in the van 
mrs gonzales said the 400mile trip that led the fugitives to 
the shootout in holdrege was a frightful experience in which the two 
couples barely spoke 
how we got caught was that i needed to use the bathroom real 
bad they wouldnt let us stop but finally my husband made them 
stop thats when we were seen she said 
a dispatcher matched the license plate number on the van to the 
number sent out on an allpoints bulletin

nasa scientists said sunday they plan to 
launch the rollsroyce of spacecraft from a space shuttle oct 
12 catapulting the ship galileo to jupiter so it can parachute a 
probe into the giant planets atmosphere 
during its looping voyage toward a december 1995 rendezvous with 
jupiter the spacecraft will fly by venus pass earth twice see 
parts of the moon not seen since the early 1960s and make the first 
close approach to an asteroid the researchers said 
the swings past venus and earth will catapult the spacecraft to 
higher speeds so that it can reach jupiter with the least 
expenditure of fuel the researchers said 
when it passes earth galileo will observe gases that cause 
greenhouse effect warming of earths atmosphere study depletion 
of earths protective ozone layer and make detailed observations of 
parts of the moon for which only relatively primitive maps from the 
early 1960s are available said torrence johnson the project 
scientist 
the galileo spacecraft is a marvel neal ausman jr the 
mission director said during a news conference at nasas jet 
propulsion laboraory it is the most complex spacecraft weve ever 
flown at jpl probably the most complex spacecraft ever 
clayne yeates acting science and mission design manager called 
galileo the the rollsroyce of spacecraft with an array of 
scientific instruments that will allow far more detailed images and 
scientific data on jupiter and its moons than could be obtained by 
the twin voyager spacecraft 
among the innovations is a new imaging device that will allow 
researchers to take a picture every twoandonethird seconds the 
television cameras on voyager 2 can take a picture only once every 
50 or 60 seconds said yeates 
voyager 2 is flying past the planet neptune this week the climax 
of its 12year 44billion trek past four planets it explored 
jupiter in 1979 
galileo will drop a probe by parachute into the jovian atmosphere 
to make detailed observations jupiters atmosphere is covered with 
ammonia clouds and may contain ice clouds and water droplets 
underneath 
researchers expect to get data on lightning bolts 10000 to 
100000 times as strong as those seen on earth galileo will pass 
600 miles from the jovian moon io which has the most active 
volcanoes in the solar system 
the shuttle atlantis is scheduled to carry galileo into earth 
orbit oct 12 then launch the spacecraft galileo will be boosted 
into a trajectory that will take it looping around venus where it 
will study the planets atmosphere and make an attempt to confirm 
the existence of lightning there 
galileo then will swing back past earth in december 1990 using 
earths gravity as a slingshot to pick up speed 
its next stop will be the asteroid belt between jupiter and mars 
where in october 1991 it will pass 600 miles from the asteroid 
gaspra a typical asteroid about 10 miles long 
we dont have any pictures of asteroids said johnson 
nobodys been by one 
the spacecraft then will swing past earth again before being sent 
on its way to jupiter it may have a second opportunity to pass by 
an asteroid in august 1993 
galileo will make about 10 orbits around jupiter passing closest 
to io but also near europa and ganymede two other jovian moons 
the galileo mission has been repeatedly delayed since work began 
in 1977 at which time launch was set for 1982 budget cuts during 
the reagan administration design changes and the explosion of the 
challenger space shuttle all contributed to the delay said john 
casani former project manager and now in charge of all flight 
projects at jpl

a sacred pole topped with a human scalp and 
said to have the power of life and unity was presented to the omaha 
tribe on sunday after being held 101 years in a boston museum 
the pole believed to more than 300 years old is a symbol of 
unity for the american indian tribe its last keeper yellow smoke 
entrusted it to the peabody museum at harvard university because he 
doubted younger generations of omahas would cherish it 
tribal officials recently negotiated its return 
it will take up where it left off in 1888 tribal chairman 
doran morris said last month it is a central part of our lives 
it will influence our children and grandchildren 
the pole more than five feet long and four inches thick is made 
of pine believed to have been cut in northern nebraska in the 1600s 
or 1700s 
at its top is a human scalp animal skin webbing wrapped around 
the middle of the pole contains feathers and down from cranes a 
stake made from ash is at the bottom 
the omaha who were buffalo hunters had a priest or keeper 
carry the pole from camp to camp he was selected from one of the 
tribes two ancient units the sky people or the earth people 
an annual renewal ceremony was held with the pole at its center 
to unify the tribe 
the renewal ceremony included exchanges of reeds poles and 
buffalo meat songs and images combined to remind people that the 
pole stood for both a person of the tribe and the tribe as a whole 
when the buffalo were wiped out the omaha settled on their 
reservation in eastern nebraska and abandoned the ceremony 
a 1911 report by government ethnologists recounts the legend of 
the pole the son of an omaha chief was hunting alone in the forest 
when elders were in council to devise ways of keeping the tribe 
together 
he came upon a tree that was luminous but remained unconsumed by 
its own light the legend says the tree was cut down trimmed 
adorned with a scalp and called a human being 
when the tribe gathered the chiefs stood up and said you now 
see before you a mystery whenever we meet with troubles we shall 
bring our troubles to him the pole we shall make offerings and 
requests all our prayers must be accompanied by gifts

editors of several polishamerican newspapers 
welcomed the nomination of a solidarity editor as polands first 
noncommunist prime minister but said tadeusz mazowiecki faces 
daunting tasks in the weeks ahead 
i think this is really a revolutionary occurrence this is the 
only choice for poland right now said wanda cytowski editor of 
straz a weekly newspaper published in scranton pa whose polish 
name means the guard 
the next step will be the process of gradual withdrawal of 
russian influence said emigre cecary stolarczyk a political 
editor at the weekly newspater gwiazda polarna polar star in 
stevens point wis 
cytowski and stolarcyzk were interviewed by telephone friday 
after mazowiecki editor of solidaritys weekly newspaper tygodnik 
solidarnosc said he had been designated prime minister polish 
president wojciech jaruzelski made it official saturday 
the nomination must be approved by the sejm or lower house of 
the national assembly which will receive the nomination monday the 
new prime minister would then try to form a cabinet to undertake the 
task of rebuilding polands crippled economy 
david franczyk editor of the monthly polishamerican journal in 
buffalo ny also said his magazine would push for the creation of 
a polish marshall plan like the us effort that helped put 
western europe back on its feet after the devestation of world war 
ii 
franczyk said the 100 million that the united states has 
proposed giving poland was a drop in the bucket adding our 
government should be inclined to give more money 
the most important question is whether the western countries 
including the united states will help poland not just with raw 
money but to encourage business stolarczyk said 
stolarczyk who lost his job as a journalist in poland because of 
his solidarity membership said the union was taking a risk in 
moving from the opposition to the head of the government 
i believe the communist party functionaries countrywide will 
not eagerly help the solidarity government to run the country he 
said he suggested the communists whose 45year rule coincided with 
near economic collapse might try to show the opposition was 
incapable of reviving the economy 
franczyk said the united states should seize the opportunity to 
develop closer ties with poland without provoking the soviet union 
the editors said they thought solidarity leader lech walesa had 
made a shrewd move by not becoming prime minister mazowiecki is a 
close adviser to walesa 
cytowski said mazowieckis government would have to consider 
unpopular measures to rebuild the polish economy 
the new prime minister will have to compromise to run the 
government franczyk said i think if walesa compromises his 
message is dead 
chester grabowski editor of the post eagle a weekly 
polishamerican newspaper published in clifton nj said i knew 
walesa wouldnt accept it and am glad they picked a newspaper man

titus andronicus must be the most difficult 
of shakespeares plays to stage and to watch 
more often than not directors allow the violence to overwhelm 
the tragedy making the play seem like a togaandsandal version of 
nightmare on elm street or halloween with the characters 
turned into ghoulish cartoons bent only on revenge and theatergoers 
are either repulsed by its gruesome and graphic violence or break 
into nervous giggles over all the bloodshed and debauchery 
director michael maggio negotiates a reasonable balance between 
those violent deeds and the plays personal tragedy in his striking 
straightforward production which opened over the weekend at the 
delacorte theater in central park 
maggio associate artistic director of chicagos goodman theater 
is the real star of this production number 11 in the new york 
shakespeare festivals sixyear marathon of all of shakespeares 
plays 
the director plays it straight theres no need for any more 
excess not in a play in which the title character allows his hand 
to be cut off his two sons are beheaded his daughter raped and 
mutilated and he gets his revenge by serving up the children of his 
chief rival in what looks like a chicken pot pie 
titus andronicus is an early shakespeare play with minimal 
poetry and character development but the promise is there you can 
see and hear echoes of king lear othello and richard 
iii and maggio has encouraged his strong cast to find it 
he has coaxed a credible if subdued performance from donald 
moffat in the title role if the actors portrayal lacks the steely 
resolve for vengeance he captures the mans sorrow as one by one 
his children die kate mulgrew chews the scenery as well as her 
sons as the treacherous tamora queen of the goths its a showy 
role and she revels in it 
keith david delivers the evenings best acting job as aaron 
tamoras consort his evil is so overwhelming that it verges on 
parody but david manages to make it credible not an easy task 
the rest of the cast is uneven ranging from the moving pamela 
gien as titus doomed daughter lavinia to the embarrassing don r 
mcmanus as the newly crowned emperor of rome 
the costumes by lewis d rampino and the settings of columns by 
john lee beatty are as traditional as the direction but this is one 
case where tradition works illuminating a play that often seems 
impossible to produce

mickey rooney and freddie krueger dont mix 
thats the lesson of buzzsaw berkeley the mildly amusing but 
very silly slasher and letsputonashow musical that also arrived 
over the weekend offbroadway the production at the wpa theater 
the company that gave the world little shop of horrors offers 
one funny performer the unsinkable ethyl eichelberger and not much 
else 
eichelberger plays several parts including the title character as 
well as an aging ziegfeld follies girl who years ago gave birth to a 
homicidal maniac her offspring now goes around killing anybody who 
decides to sing 
that has put a crimp into the plans of little mickey looney 
keith reddin and judy gorgon shauna hicks who want to mount a 
barn production of a new musical the history of human 
civilization 
but their cast keeps dying off done in by the mysterious killer 
eventually the villain is caught but it seems to take forever doug 
wright who wrote the wildly uneven book and michael john lachiusa 
who did the occasionally sprightly music and lyrics spread their 
spoofing a bit thin they make fun of everything from long days 
journey into night to babes in arms to the exorcist to 
the wizard of oz 
unlike charles buschs hilarious the lady in question done 
earlier this year at the wpa there is no consistent point of view 
buzzsaw berkeley takes potshots at just about every movie genre 
and ends up resembling none of them it sure dilutes the fun

across the divided city killing three people and shattering a 
24hour lull 
the syrians opened up against the christian coastline north of 
beirut claiming that ships carrying arms were trying to unload in 
christian ports 
police said christian forces struck back with sustained barrages 
of 155mm howitzers aimed at syrian gun emplacements in and around 
moslem west beirut 
the duels followed gunfire and rocketpropelled clashes across 
beiruts dividing green line that pierced a day of calm in the 
latest round of lebanons 14yearold civil war

longdeserted mountain resort which controls a strategic road 
network into the christian enclave 
a police spokesman said hostilities were considerably less 
intense than the shelling duels that terrorized beiruts moslem and 
christian sectors in the week before the un security council 
called for a ceasefire on tuesday 
the artillery battles have driven more than 13 million of the 
beiruts 15 million residents to safety in southern lebanon 
the shelling started after aoun imposed a naval blockade on 
illegal moslem militiarun ports to salvage lost customs dues of 
about 100 million annually 
in retaliation the syrians joined the moslem militias in 
shelling the 310squaremile christian enclave north of beirut and 
blocking its land exits

the two countries are ruled by rival factions of the arab baath 
socialist party 
on sunday the iraqi bath party denounced syrias role in lebanon 
and called for arabs to demonstrate against syrian president hafez 
assad

everywhere to express their solidarity and sympathy with lebanon 
said the statement issued in baghdad tell the criminal assad 
to leave lebanon 
in oviedo spain pope john paul ii sunday accused sectarian 
fighters in lebanon of trying to wreck beirut and pleaded for a 
ceasefire the appeal came as the vatican studied the possibility 
of a papal peace mission to lebanon 
in the name of god i renew my urgent call to all responsible 
authorities for harmony and an immediate ceasefire so that a 
dialogue can begin leading to an accord in which the legitimate 
historical and religious rights of all parties are taken into 
account said the pontiff on a threeday visit to spain 
also sunday the proiranian hezbollah group said it would 
consider killing its two american hostages if the french navy 
intervenes in lebanon 
france has dispatched an aircraft carrier and a destroyer to the 
eastern mediterranean reportedly to evacuate 7000 french nationals 
from warbattered lebanon if the need arises 
but french president francois mitterrand said sunday that france 
has no intention of intervening militarily 
in a news conference in el escorial spain mitterrand said 
france has taken the precaution of sending a mission of support 
and to safeguard lives 
it is necessary to intensify diplomatic pressure to defend 
the sovereignty and independence of lebanon he said

a bargemounted incinerator underwent 
tests sunday in preparation for burning tons of oily debris 
collected from beaches fouled by the nations biggest oil spill 
waste burning was to begin monday said exxon corp spokesman 
john nicholls whose companys tanker ran onto a reef march 24 
spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil 
the incinerators temperature was being increased sunday 
nicholls said it takes quite a lot of time he said 
testing began saturday but was delayed by technical problems 
the spokesman said 
the incinerator is to be used to burn tons of debris including 
vegetation from the shore and absorbent material used by cleanup 
crews to soak up crude from beaches on kodiak island and nearby 
islands 
kodiak is more than 300 miles from valdez the port from which 
the tanker exxon valdez set out the day of the wreck 
the waste will be burned in two phases a first burn will reach 
temperatures of more than 1500 degrees a second burning of vapors 
and minute particles will require temperatures higher than 1800 
degrees nicholls said 
with alaska department of environmental conservation engineer 
mark martinson watching the incinerator was heated sunday by 
burning diesel fuel 
right now its a 24hour test burn said martinson if 
that goes all right then theyll start trashburning 
the company had planned to start saturday by burning waste barged 
to a point off the kodiak island community of port lions 
the arrangement angered some port lions residents who said they 
feared pollution might result they unsuccessfully pressed the state 
to shut down the incinerator 
seven private vessels from the area circled the barge saturday to 
protest the plan said port lions councilman ralph cone 
the state conservation agency announced friday that the operation 
qualified for a permit and denied that the burning posed a health 
threat because of the port lions residents concerns however the 
agency urged exxon to put the incinerator elsewhere 
nicholls said it was unlikely the incinerator would be moved 
saying we have a valid permit to operate where it is

a barge rammed into a pleasure boat sheared off 
the top deck and sank it in the river thames early sunday killing 
at least 26 people police said at least 78 people survived 
the barges captain and second mate were arrested but police 
later said the two would not be detained it was not clear whether 
charges would be filed 
police commander john purnell speaking at scotland yard said 
the there were 26 people known dead including one woman found 
upstream most of the dead were teenagers or in their 20s he said 
earlier police said 29 bodies had been found and there were 87 
survivors there was no explanation given for the discrepancy 
the detective heading the inquiry michael purchase said earlier 
the toll could be as high as 60 
it could be days or even weeks before the full extent of the 
tragedy is known purnell said 
scotland yard said the engine room and bilges had still to be 
searched for bodies it said salvage crews found no survivors 
police said 78 people got off the vessel alive but it was unclear 
how many people boarded the luxury river cruiser when it sailed at 1 
am on a clear warm night planning to return at dawn 
the uncertainty of the casualty toll arose from the absence of a 
passenger list and conflicting estimates of the numbers of people 
aboard scotland yard said the boat licensed for 149 passengers and 
two crew was carrying 120 to 150 people ken dwan owner of the 
marchioness company said there were no more than 110 
guests had been celebrating the 26th birthday party for london 
banker antonio vasconcellos when it sank near southwark bridge in 
the heart of the capital friends said vasconcellos was unaccounted 
for police said 
dwan said the collision between the 80ton doubledecker river 
boat and a dredger 18 times heavier was like a tank rolling over 
a small car 
an inspection by divers showed the vessels top deck was sheared 
off 
the huge thames barrier built across the river near its mouth to 
control seasonal flooding was lowered to hold back the tide and 
ease the treacherous conditions under which rescuers worked 
the five additional crew members of the 1475ton bowbelle a 
sandandgravel dredging barge were questioned as witnesses about 
the collision scotland yard said 
survivors said people were dancing socializing and enjoying the 
floating birthday party when the bowbelle one of the largest 
registered vessels on the thames crashed into the rear of the 
marchioness knocking it sideways then hitting it again and running 
straight over it 
the marchioness sank within two minutes in 25 feet of water and 
came to rest near southwark bridge in central londons financial 
district shortly before 2 am police said 
survivors said the 85footlong marchioness built during world 
war ii was privately chartered by a london modeling agency 
synchro vasconcellos was the guest of honor the connection between 
the agency and vasconcellos was not immediately clear 
many of those dancing on the top deck jumped or were thrown 
overboard shouting and screaming and battled strong tides to reach 
shore others discodancing below deck were trapped 
art student mike mosbacher 22 said he dived out of an open 
window on the top deck when he saw the barge coming 
it hit us in the side smashed into us and went straight over 
us he said the people downstairs theres no way they would 
have got out 
survivors were taken to three local hospitals doctors said the 
most serious injury was a broken leg 
everyone had been quite relaxed said annette russell 26 
people were chatting and dancing to the music it all happened 
terribly quickly we were rammed from behind and as we tried to 
get out of the situation i think the tide took the boat over and it 
turned and sank 
the government ordered an inquiry and the search continued prime 
minister margaret thatcher returned from vacation in austria and 
immediately boarded a river patrol boat to visit the scene queen 
elizabeth ii vacationing in scotland sent condolences 
the 260footlong bowbelle operated by south coast shipping 
works in the thames estuary and the north sea a spokesman for the 
firm said he would not comment on the tragedy

premier miklos nemeth on sunday 
condemned hungarys participation in the warsaw pact invasion of 
czechoslovakia that 21 years ago crushed pragues communistled 
reforms 
at a rally nemeth said hungary has proposed the soviet bloc 
alliance introduce measures that would make similar military 
intervention impossible 
nemeth said the world had moved beyond the 1968 invasion of 
czechoslovakia and the 1956 soviet intervention in hungary that 
crushed an antistalinist uprising 
hungary is making its own broad economic and political reforms 
which include national elections to be held next year 
nemeths speech which marked the day of st stephen the 
founder of the hungarian state was carried by television and radio 
the hungarian government condemns the participation in the 1968 
czechoslovak military intervention nemeth told a crowd at 
csegled 50 miles east of budapest 
the ruling communist party last week denounced the invasion of 
czechoslovakia provoking an angry response from prague 
czechoslovak communist leaders oppose the wideranging reforms 
under way in hungary poland and the soviet union 
nemeth said he believed hungarys warsaw pact initiative would 
contribute to better relations among the czech slovak and 
hungarian peoples 
we need stable reliable partners among the socialist countries 
even though they may not follow the same path as hungary 
nemeth said all revolutions in hungarian history were repressed 
by some foreign power but now we have a historic chance to take a 
new course 
nemeth also reiterated the dedication of communist party 
reformers to change 
he said goals of the ruling party included the creation of a 
genuine democracy a constitutional state a market economy respect 
for private property allowing free enterprise and religious 
freedom supporting church and community autonomy and respect for 
traditional values 
these are also included in a draft party program published in the 
weekend edition of the partys daily nepszabadsag 
the draft is to be presented at the partys congress on oct 6 
the congress is likely to pit communist reformers against those 
resistant to change 
foreign minister gyula horn said saturday the party should get 
rid of people who obstruct the implementation of reform the state

romania on sunday denounced the emergence 
of a polish government led by noncommunists and said it could 
jeoparize east bloc communism and even the sovietled warsaw pact 
alliance 
the romanian communist party newspaper scinteia in an article on 
the unprecedented political developments in poland said the 
nomination of solidarity activist tadeusz mazowiecki for prime 
minister was counter to the polish peoples interests 
it described mazowiecki as a person known for his 
antisocialist positions connected with imperialist reactionary 
circles 
with good reason public opinion in romania shows its concern 
over such an evolution it said 
the article was carried by the romanian state news agency 
agerpres monitored in vienna 
it was the harshest criticism any of the east bloc countries have 
made of poland 
news reports of mazowieckis nomination saturday by communist 
president wojciech jaruzelski was restrained in east germany 
czechslovakia and bulgaria 
the soviets official tass news agency carried a dispatch 
saturday saying polands communist officials complained of the 
confrontational actions of the leaders of the opposition 
yugoslavia has been relative independent of the soviet bloc and 
the tanjug news agency said the nomination of mazowiecki put the 
polish government crisis in calmer waters the hungarian news 
media mainly reported the developments 
scinteia said the situation in poland places in jeopardy the 
interests of socialism of the warsaw treaty included 
it said mazowieckis nomination serves the interests of the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the most reactionary forces 
the romanian people believe that everything possible should 
be done for a government to be formed by the communist party 
to ensure the collaboration with the socialist countries the 
article said 
it added romania was confident that the polish communist party 
will be able to overcome the difficulties that emerged of late and 
will work firmly for the triumph of the ideas of socialism 
romania under the leadership of president nicolae ceausescu has 
often been a maverick in the soviet bloc and was the only warsaw 
pact member that refused to pariticpate in the sovietled invasion 
of czechoslovakia in 1968 
but it has been rigidly resistant to any liberalization and 
ceausescu has repeatedly expressed concern over reforms in the 
soviet union hungary and other east bloc countries the news media 
has made little mention of the recent developments in poland 
polands communist party central committee in a resolution 
released sunday stressed the nations continued membership in the 
warsaw pact military alliance solidarity has said it would not 
undermine the pact

human rights in washington who said she has known toai for more 
than 15 years

the enemy with writer david chanoff and is executive director of 
the institute for democracy in vietnam 
the writer was shot by two men described as asian and driving a 
station wagon moon said sheriffs investigators have not been able

police and soldiers rounded up nearly 
10000 suspects in an unprecedented nationwide crackdown on cocaine 
traffickers blamed for the assassination of leading presidential 
candidate luis carlos galan officials said sunday 
tens of thousands of people many openly weeping and calling out 
for justice packed downtown streets for galans funeral sunday 
president virgilio barco characterized him as a martyr in an 
intensifying war on the fearsome drug underworld 
according to a defense ministry communique issued sunday night 
police and military authorities have rounded up 9896 suspects 
raided 298 homes of suspected drug dealers and seized 330 arms and 
about four tons of cocaine since barco announced emergency crackdown 
measures friday

the sweep which included raids at the posh and wellguarded estates 
and other properties of several suspected cocaine chieftains 
including pablo escobar gaviria rodriguez gacha and jorge ochoa 
there were no reports that the leaders of the medellin cocaine 
cartel were arrested 
assassins believed hired by the drug cartel gunned down galan a 
46yearold liberal party senator and presidential candidate during 
a friday night political rally in the town of soacha 20 miles south 
of bogota 
the death capped a 48hour wave of assassinations that also 
included a provincial commander of the national police force and a 
bogota magistrate all of the victims were active in combating drugs 
in washington attorney general dick thornburgh expressed support 
sunday for sending us troops to colombia to help fight drug lords 
i think we have to look at any request that we get for either 
law enforcement or military assistance seriously he said on nbcs 
meet the press program 
about 50000 colombians lined downtown streets for galans 
funeral procession waving white handkerchiefs and singing the 
national anthem as the flagdraped coffin was carried from the 
capital building to the national cathedral 
at galans funeral service barco declared galans and his 
partys fight against the criminal narcotics trafficking 
organization was frontal and without concessions the threats did 
not take him from his commitment 
every colombian and foreigner who takes drugs must remember 
they are helping those who assassinated galan and hundreds of others 
in this battle he said 
the president described his country as the biggest victim of an 
international organization dedicated to the crime of drug 
trafficking the most gigantic and powerful such organization that 
has ever existed 
his emergency measures included extradition of proven drug 
traffickers to the united states barco in his speech at the 
funeral service called for international solidarity in fighting

death 
according to press reports escobar gaviria the head of the 
medellin drug cartel that reportedly supplies most of the united 
states and europe with cocaine traveled to panama earlier this week 
after ordering a series of killings including galans 
the drug cartels announced saturday they would step up violence 
in a bid to force the government to negotiate with them although 
they have never publicly stated their demands in detail 
in a communique released to radio stations the cartels said 
now the fight is with blood and vowed to oppose any government 
moves to bring them to justice 
the statement was signed the extraditables a reference to 
those drug leaders wanted in the united states 
drug kingpins have lived in colombia under cover for the last 
decade without any major interference from authorities 
galans death brought renewed calls for firmer action including 
a military campaign on the drug strongholds scattered throughout 
this remote mountainous country 
political support for stronger measures seemed limited however 
with some political leaders calling for direct negotiations with the 
cartels 
we have tried many measures without success now is the time 
for dialogue said juan gomez martinez the mayor of medellin the 
city is known as one of the most violent in the world and a center 
for drug activities in colombia

cost to workers according to a statement by pacific bell the pact 
allows workers to see doctors outside the network but they would 
have to pay more

650 for some skilled technicians according to union figures 
although the contract must still be approved by membership a 
ratification vote isnt expected for several weeks

asked some 17000 managers to remain at temporary job assignments 
this week 
we have company economists being directory assistance operators

between the ibew and sister company new jersey bell officials said 
its a step forward but were not really going anywhere

as 600 a year per worker and a new healthcare arrangement intended 
to hold down costs bell of pennsylvania said 
in another development new york telephone co a nynex 
subsidiary reported discovering 13 cases of burned or cut phone 
lines in new york state and connecticut on saturday and sunday

the government abruptly ended contract talks 
at mexicos largest copper mine declaring it bankrupt and 
dispatching soldiers to guard the premises 
a bankruptcy judge declared the cananea mining co located 25 
miles south of the arizona border insolvent after management said 
it could not meet expenses much less give in to the unions demands 
the union had demanded a 60 percent wage increase a shorter work 
week longer vacations and an extensive benefits package that 
cananea mining co said would have meant a 330 percent raise for 
each miner 
cananeas 3000 workers threatened to strike on aug 28 if the 
contract negotiations were not resolved the talks began on june 24 
the national development agency that owns cananea nafinsa said 
soldiers intervened to take care of hazardous materials 
including 70 tons of dynamite stored on mine premises 
there is a long history of labor conflict at cananea and tensions 
have been particularly high since the government decided to sell the 
mine to private investors 
two deals to sell cananea have fallen through since last year 
and according to reports in the financial press this week the 
government believed the mine would be more attractive to buyers 
without an expensive union contract 
layoffs were to begin immediately cananea said in a statement 
cananea said the mine would reopen when the international copper 
market improved a new workforce would then be hired according to 
the statement 
both the state and federal governments were to undertake 
development programs in the company town of cananea to ease its 
dependence on the mine the statement said about 25000 people live 
in cananea 
the mine founded by an american entrepreneur in 1899 produces 
about 160 tons of copper a year about 40 percent was exported 
cananea had tried to improve efficiency and modernize in recent 
years but a decline in the worldwide price of copper hurt its 
earnings

anniversaries of past bloodshed 
have prompted a roman catholic bishop and an anglican bishop to call 
on both religious communities to stop celebrating old wounds 
the roman catholic bishop of down and connor the right rev 
cahal daly and the anglican bishop of connor the right rev samuel 
poyntz both said dwelling on the past only prolongs friction 
between protestants and catholics 
a week ago protestants converged on londonderry to mark the 
300th anniversary of a victory over the forces of the catholic king 
james ii 
supporters of the mainly catholic ira marched in belfast and in 
londonderry to mark the 20th anniversary of the deployment of 
british troops and the 18th anniversary of the longdiscarded 
british policy of detaining terrorist suspects without trial 
if we continue to dwell on the past there can only be a 
continuation of the miserygoround said poyntz who called last 
week for both sides to agree to a date for calling off the 
anniversary celebrations 
is it possible for us to leave the commemoration of past events 
behind at least until the situation has cooled down and instead to 
emphasize the opportunities of the present and the future poyntz 
said 
it is time to move on from this continual reliving of the past 
it is time to move forward daly said following a visit with the 
parents of a 15yearold boy killed by a plastic bullet during a 
disturbance 
the anniversaries are looked forward to with apprehension and 
fear by local communities that are held to ransom the catholic 
bishop said 
it was the protestant march in londonderry 20 years ago that 
provoked violence that led to the troops being called in 
at the march in londonderry organized by sinn fein the legal 
wing of the ira the wings publicity director danny morrison 
scoffed at the bishops appeal 
i dont mean to offend anybody at all but bishops saying 
theyre against commemorations morrison said is there anybody 
commemorates things more often than bishops whats going to go 
next christmas 
protestant marches celebrate past triumphs and wave the british 
union jack republican parades honor the martyrs of the cause of a 
united ireland free of britain and proceed under the orange white 
and green flag of ireland 
these celebrations recall what the english writer william 
makepeace thackeray observed in the 19th century to have an 
opinion about ireland one must begin by getting at the truth and 
where is it to be had in the country or rather there are two 
truths the catholic truth and the protestant truth belief is made 
a party business 
aug 12 holds an importance on the protestant calendar second 
only to july 12 celebrated as the victory of the protestant william 
of orange over james ii the 300th anniversary is next year in 
1991 its 300 years since william whipped james again at the battle 
of aughrim 
nelson mccausland a protestant member of the belfast city 
council said the loyalist celebrations commemorated the defense of 
civil and religious liberty 
by contrast the republican demonstrations are organized by 
those whose business is murder and destruction mccausland said 
paul arthur a lecturer at the university of ulster wrote in the 
irish times of dublin that it is difficult to exaggerate the 
damage done to the political process by these celebrations 
they are not cathartic but serve to live on another mans 
wounds arthur recalled the words of a poem written in the context 
of one of northern irelands many republican campaigns these are 
the martyrs who die for a future buried in the 
past

the stunts called for in his movies 
i still do some of them but i dont do any of the hard ones

pope john paul ii on sunday accused 
sectarian fighters in lebanon of trying to wreck the city of beirut 
and pleaded for a ceasefire 
it was his second call in five days for an end to the bloodshed 
it came as the vatican was exploring the possibility of a papal 
peace mission to lebanon which is wracked by 14 years of civil war 
in the name of god i renew my urgent call to all responsible 
authorities for harmony and an immediate ceasefire so that a 
dialogue can begin leading to an accord in which the legitimate 
historical and religious rights of all parties are taken into 
account the pontiff said at the end of a mass midway through his 
threeday visit to spain 
the pope did not criticize any groups by name but he appeared to 
refer to syrian soldiers and allied moslem militias when he said 
it seems that the intention is to destroy the city of beirut and 
in particular the zones inhabited by christians 
more than 750 people have been killed since fighting broke out 
between the syrianled fighters and christian troops in march only 
about 150000 of beiruts 15 million people have remained in the 
city 
vatican officials were trying to contact lebanese leaders to 
press john pauls peace effort but there were no announcements 
sunday about the popes earlier offer to visit lebanon 
hes trying to do everything he can said papal spokesman 
joaquin navarro however he said the vatican did not envision 
playing an official negotiating role in lebanon 
the polish pontiff issued his ceasefire call at the end of a 
mass wrapping up the vaticansponsored 4th world youth day 
celebrations in the northwestern city of santiago de compostela 
thousands of the estimated 400000 participants from 55 countries 
signed an appeal for peace in lebanon it was to be sent to the 
united nations 
later sunday the pope visited a cathedral in the northern mining 
center of oviedo and spoke at a mass at a field outside the city 
he told a crowd of about 100000 people it was necessary to 
create new forms of solidarity and organization of work to 
ensure that workers of all economic levels are respected 
echoing a central theme of his papacy john paul called the 
marxist model of collective labor a failure but also criticized 
capitalist societies saying they fostered materialism and inequality 
the pontiffs oviedo stop and a scheduled trip monday to the 
mountain shrine of covadonga were aimed at spanish catholics while 
the earlier part of the trip was geared to youth worldwide the pope 
is to return to rome monday 
the world youth day celebrations were highlighted by a rally 
saturday night at santiago de compostelas gozo mountain tens of 
thousands of youths spent the night in sleeping bags on the dusty 
hill to ensure a place for the papal mass there sunday morning 
in his homily to the young people john paul called for a 
christian radicalism to aid youth who are unemployed hungry 
addicted to drugs or slaves of the eroticism spread everywhere 
the youths who packed santiago de compostela included a group of 
lebanese who waved their countrys red white and green flag 
after singling out the group john paul said in spanish i 
lament strongly that despite the efforts of this past week also on 
the part of the security council of the united nations the 
bombardments continue to create victims and suffering among the most 
beloved people of lebanon 
the 69yearold pontiffs trip is his third to spain and the 43rd 
foreign voyage of his 11year papacy

a sacred pole topped with a human scalp and 
said to have the power of life and unity was presented to the omaha 
tribe on sunday after being held 101 years in a boston museum 
the pole believed to more than 300 years old is a symbol of 
unity for the american indian tribe its last keeper yellow smoke 
entrusted it to the peabody museum at harvard university because he 
doubted younger generations of omahas would cherish it 
tribal officials who recently negotiated its return welcomed it 
back sunday during the tribes 185th annual powwow at its 
northeastern nebraska reservation 
although the pole was away from you physically the spirit of 
the sacred pole never left you said robin ridington a professor 
of anthropology who has studied the pole 
about 1000 people dressed in ceremonial headdresses and beaded 
leather vests as well as batman tshirts dress shirts and blue 
jeans looked on as the pole was blessed with cedar smoke and an 
eagle feather 
tribal chairman doran morris carried the pole which is more than 
5 feet long and 4 inches thick and consists mostly of pine around a 
circle of white bleachers in a meadow dancers followed as drums and 
chanting filled the air 
about 6000 people attended the fourday powwow which ended 
sunday said tribal historian dennis hastings about 1600 of the 
2700 omaha live on the reservation hastings said 
the pole is believed to have been cut in northern nebraska in the 
1600s or 1700s 
at its top is a human scalp animal skin webbing wrapped around 
the middle of the pole contains feathers and down from cranes a 
stake made from ash is at the bottom 
the omaha who were buffalo hunters had a priest or keeper 
carry the pole from camp to camp he was selected from one of the 
tribes two ancient units the sky people or the earth people 
the annual renewal ceremony was held with the pole at its center 
to unify the tribe 
the renewal ceremony included exchanges of reeds poles and 
buffalo meat songs and images combined to remind people that the 
pole stood for both a person of the tribe and the tribe as a whole 
when the buffalo were wiped out the omaha settled on their 
reservation and abandoned the ceremony 
a 1911 report by government ethnologists recounts the legend of 
the pole the son of an omaha chief was hunting alone in the forest 
when elders were in council to devise ways of keeping the tribe 
together 
he came upon a tree that was luminous but remained unconsumed by 
its own light the legend says the tree was cut down trimmed 
adorned with a scalp and called a human being 
when the tribe gathered the chiefs stood up and said you now 
see before you a mystery whenever we meet with troubles we shall 
bring our troubles to him the pole we shall make offerings and 
requests all our prayers must be accompanied by gifts

in the private and mysterious world of 
highpowered jewelry dealing arthur groom stands out like a diamond 
in the rough 
groom 39 whose firm sold 12 million worth of diamonds and 
other gems last year frequently travels to jungles cavernous mines 
and other remote spots in asia and africa in a constant search for 
the worlds rarest rocks 
like the sailing merchants of centuries past groom will barter 
and trade for many of his stones he recently swapped a shipload of 
cement for 1 million worth of diamond roughs from the african 
nation of sierra leone 
groom seeks stones in dangerous striferidden nations such as 
burma where he says he is only the third american since 1962 to 
gain the rights to deal in rubies most recently groom closed a 
deal to become the sole distributor of american soft drinks in that 
southeast asian nation he plans to repatriate the profits in gems 
and while most diamond dealers prefer to keep their actions 
cloaked in secrecy groom who is outspoken and friendly seeks the 
spotlight he employs a publicist who pitches groom as a modernday 
indiana jones 
there have been very few dealers who are so public said abe 
michael shainberg executive director of new yorks exclusive 
diamond dealers club considered the worlds most important diamond 
exchange the average diamond dealer for security reasons does 
not want such publicity 
he described groom as an honest and honorable man his 
publicity is good for his business and good for the rest of us 
too 
seated in a small office at his fashionable store in the new york 
suburb of ridgewood groom proudly showed off stones with 100000 
price tags the shirtsleeved man who wore no jewelry smiled and 
insisted he is not indiana jones 
no intrigue he said but i do have a message 
groom says american business can exert a positive influence 
throughout the world he is convinced the world respects the 
american system but americans must also understand and respect 
other cultures 
in many cultures the american way does not hold up he said 
how dare we have that attitude that ours is the only way 
grooms story however is the stuff of the american dream he 
left a successful job as a stockbroker for merrill lynch amp co 15 
years ago after a friends father urged him to take a gem course 
that left him absolutely fascinated with precious stones 
groom said he struggled at first working 15hour days in a 
oneroom enterprise as his friends climbed their respective 
corporate ladders arthur groom amp co in ridgewood and his american 
trading co in new york slowly grew into a 
multimilliondollarayear business with offices around the globe 
unlike some dealers who only work the phones groom goes directly 
to faraway mines to pick out his own stones and diamond roughs one 
of the few dealers who sells both diamonds and other gems groom is 
the consumate frequent flyer logging more than 150000 miles each 
year 
groom said he draws energy from his work 
theres a science to picking stones in the jungle he said 
then you go to the diamond dealers club and pull up your 
shirtsleeves and wheel and deal some saturdays ill simply work 
the floor of this stoor helping an old lady who needs a 10 
soldering job on a broken chain 
his ruby deal with burma brought groom facetoface with military 
leaders of a nation that was virtually shut off to american 
businessmen since its 1962 coup the burmese rubies groom said are 
the rarest and most desirable stones in the world retailing for 
about 10000 a carat 
when asked if dealing with burmas harsh government tugged at his 
conscience groom nodded yes 
but ill be putting 1200 people to work in the soft drink 
bottling plant i really believe we should be there to have a 
presence 
groom said he was moved by the poverty in many african nations 
he said he believes trading cement food and clothing for gems will 
make a difference there 
its easy to pay cash groom said but what good does it do 
for those countries who gets the money these people need so much

burma which shunned foreign involvement in 
its economy for more than a quarter of a century has announced a 
joint manufacturing venture with a private foreign company 
the official working peoples daily said saturday the new 
company myanmar burma singapore international limited was 
formed aug 18 and has an authorized capital of 50 million burmese 
kyats 
the kyat trades officially at about 65 to the us dollar but at 
more than 40 to the dollar on the thriving black market 
it is the first manufacturing joint venture announced between the 
new burmese government and a private foreign firm 
the new trading company will manufacture and market construction 
and electrical goods stationery and printing and photographic 
goods the newspaper said 
its 5000 shares will be divided equally between the singaporean 
company sks marketing ltd and burmas military government the 
newspaper said 
burma once was one of southeast asias richest countries but a 
quarter of a century of restrictive socialist planning brought it to 
the brink of economic collapse by last year 
burma was declared a leastdeveloped country in 1987 by the 
united nations and its foreign debt stands at over 3 billion 
the military government began a more open economic policy after 
it crushed a nationwide uprising for democratic change last 
september killing hundreds 
some foreign governments including the united states and members 
of the european economic community cut their financial assistance in 
protest but others mainly asian countries have cooperated with 
the new rulers 
however most trading agreements reached since the army takeover 
have involved the extraction or purchase of burmas natural 
resources 
analysts say one of the main obstacles to the expansion of 
burmas international trade remains the artificially high value of 
the kyat which rangoon has refused to devalue
