pete rose bet on cincinnati reds games over a 
threeyear span beginning in 1985 and once accumulated a 400000 
gambling debt over a threemonth period the sports investigator 
concludes in a 225page report released monday 
the report by baseball investigator john m dowd was publicly 
released monday by a state judge who had kept it private until after 
he ruled on roses request for a temporary restraining order 
between may and july 1987 rose bet 2000 per game on 
baseball including reds games the report said 
hamilton county common pleas judge norbert a nadel released the 
report monday under pressure from the ohio supreme court which said 
he had no reason to keep it sealed 
nadel on sunday granted roses request to block a hearing that 
was scheduled for monday in new york with baseball commissioner a 
bartlett giamatti 
rose cincinnatis manager could be banned from the game for 
life if it is determined that he bet on the reds dowds report said 
there was much evidence that he did although it noted that rose has 
denied under oath he ever bet on major league baseball 
the accumulated testimony of witnesses together with 
documentary evidence and telephone records reveal extensive betting 
activity by pete rose with professional baseball and in particular 
cincinnati reds games during the 1985 1986 and 1987 seasons 
dowd said in the report 
the report quotes rose associate paul g janszen as saying 
within a threemonth period of time pete rose was in debt over 
400000 to the bookie in new york it does not indicate if the 
debt was due to baseball debts or wagers on other sports 
rose bet 52 times on the reds and won 29 from april 8july 5 
1987 according to gambling records cited in dowds report 
dowd cited telephone records and betting slips supplied by 
janszen who claims to have run bets for rose as supporting 
evidence he also said that evidence supports the testimony of 
bookmaker ronald peters who claims he took perhaps more than 1 
million in bets on behalf of rose over a twoyear period 
the evidence revealed that in order to protect his stature as 
one of the most famous baseball players in major league history 
pete rose employed middlemen to place bets for him with bookmakers 
and at the raetrack and to pay gambling losses and collect gambling 
winnings thereby concealing his gambling activity dowd wrote 
despite the 400000 debt the report said rose had been 
successful early in the 1987 season in bets with peters roses 
chief accuser 
david morgan an associate of peters recalled being told by 
peters during the 1987 season that he was getting murdered by 
pete rose on baseball 
morgan stated that peters advised him that rose had him 
hooked for about seventyfive thousand the report said 
in addition the report says that rose owned half of a 47646 
piksix ticket at turfway park on april 6 1989 thomas p gioiosa 
roses former housemate falsely represented to the irs that he 
was the sole winner the report said gioiosa has been indicted 
for that and rose is under investigation by a federal grand jury in 
cincinnati 
after the reds beat los angeles 53 monday night rose was asked 
if he believed the report was balanced 
i can give you an outline he said theres 225 pages and 
theres two paragraphs positive about me its such a biased report 
its unbelievable but we will face that because theres not a thing 
we can do about it 
robert g stachler a rose attorney said he was not bothered 
that the report was made public he declined further comment

president bush supports legislation to restore 
criminal penalties for flagdesecration but hasnt decided whether 
to back a constitutional amendment his spokesman said monday 
we havent undertaken a kind of legal analysis that would yield 
some definitive action said press secretary marlin fitzwater 
however he said bushs views were clear 
he was very upset about last weeks 54 supreme court ruling 
overturning flagdesecration laws in 48 states and im sure 
bush shares the views of members of congress and others who have 
all expressed their feeling that the flag should not be desecrated 
in any way fitzwater said 
in an interview published in tuesday editions of the new york 
times bush said i think ive sublimated some of the passion i 
feel and im very openminded as to what to do about it and ive 
asked our attorney general dick thornburgh and chief of staff 
john sununu to recommend what to do about it 
bush told his interviewers the depth of his feeling possibly 
goes back to ones own personal experience in life too being in 
the service and all in combat 
bushs plane was shot down and two crew members killed in 1945 
bush was rescued from the pacific ocean bu a us submarine 
flag burning is wrong dead wrong bush said after the 
ruling but said he would enforce the supreme court edict as 
president 
there have been moves in both the house and the senate to meet 
the supreme courts objections and make flagdesecration a federal 
offense but lawmakers are divided on how best to accomplish that 
some favor an amendment to the constitution 
the congress is looking at possible legislation but at this 
point we dont have an official view in terms of legislation 
fitzwater said 
but i think the presidents attitude is certainly clear and if 
legislation was developed and passed im sure it would be one that 
he would support 
fitzwater said a preponderance of scholars seem to be 
suggesting that a constitutional amendment is not a very good way 
to go

hotel queen leona helmsley went on trial monday 
on federal charges that she evaded income taxes by disguising about 
4 million in renovations to her mansion as business expenses 
mrs helmsley 68 watched as potential jurors were questioned 
about their impartiality and how much they knew about the highly 
publicized case 
by late afternoon us district judge john walker had 
interviewed 18 potential jurors and dismissed four 
walker said he would screen the pool of 160 prospective jurors 
this week and allow attorneys to make their final peremptory 
challenges july 5 before opening arguments 
one man was excused because he said he was upset about being 
asked his salary and because he was mad at judges in general for 
allowing the flag to be burned referring to last weeks supreme 
court decision 
the other potential jurors who were dismissed were a man who had 
read an article about mrs helmsley in mondays new york post an 
accountant who once did work for a company that will be named at 
trial and a man who said he was angry with the internal revenue 
service for the way it handled a tax problem 
mrs helmsley was named in a 47count indictment in april 1988 
with her husband harry and two former helmsley executives 
the helmsleys who head a 5 billion hotel and real estate 
empire were accused of evading personal income taxes by concealing 
about 4 million in renovations to their greenwich conn mansion 
as business expenses 
helmsley 80 has been found incompetent to stand trial because 
of his memory lapses 
the other defendants frank turco and joseph v licari are 
charged with helping create bogus invoices to make it appear the 
renovations on the 28room mansion were taxdeductible improvements 
on business properties 
many potential jurors said they knew the helmsleys from media 
reports and mrs helmsley from advertisements for her hotels that 
portray her as the queen of helmsleyowned hotels 
walker allowed jurors to remain in the pool if they said they 
could be impartial 
one answer given by a 28yearold architects intern prompted a 
cold stare from mrs helmsley 
the juror was asked what he knew of the helmsleys from the media 
hes old and feeble and leona runs things the man said

chemicals that make poison gas us officials confirmed monday 
night 
the officials said secretary of state james a baker iii 
discussed the sale with foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
during genschers visit to the united states last week 
weve been very happy with the german response said one 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
both officials said they did not have precise details of just 
what the german government was doing in the case 
the new york times said in tuesday editions that a dusseldorf 
firm which us officials did not identify had acted as a broker 
in arranging the sale to iran of hundreds of tons of thionyl 
chloride a chemical that can be used to make mustard gas by an 
indian manufacturer

david maier believes he lost his arm in the service of his 
country his country until now has disagreed 
the arm a casualty of cancer not combat was amputated at the 
shoulder seven years after maiers discharge from the navy 
but the vietnam veteran now 46 and living in bay village ohio 
puts the blame for his cancer on agent orange the toxic herbicide 
us troops sprayed over the jungles of southeast asia he is 
convinced it was awash in the coffeecolored mekong river water 
pumped aboard his ship for showers 
like more than 34000 other vietnam veterans who believe they 
have become ill because of agent orange maier applied for 
government disability benefits and like all but five of those 
applicants he was denied 
now maier hopes his claim will be reconsidered thanks to a 
federal judges ruling in san francisco last month that found the 
government failed to give agent orange claimants the benefit of the 
doubt 
to the surprise of many veterans the bush administration decided 
not to appeal instead veterans secretary edward derwinski 
announced that the department of veterans affairs the new name for 
the veterans administration would rewrite its rules for granting 
disability 
derwinskis decision could open the door to claims from hundreds 
of thousands of vietnam veterans 
although 34000 have applied for disability on the basis of agent 
orange exposure about 250000 veterans are listed in a registry of 
those who believe they were exposed to the herbicide many never 
applied because they believed they didnt stand a chance of getting 
disability 
officials for some veterans organizations say theyre cautiously 
optimistic that the va has changed its attitude along with its name 
it is our feeling at this point that secretary derwinski really 
does want to see some change said barry kasinitz a spokesman for 
vietnam veterans of america the group that brought the lawsuit in 
san francisco 
others remain skeptical their attitude reflecting the deep 
bitterness that many vietnam veterans feel toward a government that 
they believe used and abandoned them 
well believe it when we see it said james sparrow the 
executive director of vietnam veterans agent orange victims an 
advocacy group based in stamford conn 
its my feeling that theyll probably do as little as they 
can said sandra hosty an attorney for swords to plowshares a 
san francisco group that provides counseling and representation for 
veterans seeking benefits 
still ms hosty added i would love to be surprised i would 
love to be wrong 
agent orange named for the orangestriped drums in which it was 
stored was developed for the military in the early 1940s it was a 
5050 mixture of two powerful herbicides 24d and 245t 
in vietnam us troops sprayed agent orange from the air to 
strip away the enemys jungle cover and deplete its crops it worked 
devastatingly well 
the herbicide was banned after the chemical dioxin which is 
present in 245t was found to be the most carcinogenic substance 
ever tested on laboratory animals 
veterans organizations have pointed to evidence that the 
herbicide may cause serious disorders including nonhodgkins 
lymphoma softtissue sarcoma and a liver ailment known as pct 
the va on the other hand has maintained that agent orange has 
been scientifically linked to only one illness in humans a severe 
skin rash called chloracne and the government has insisted that 
veterans seeking benefits because of chloracne provide proof that 
they got the rash from agent orange a burden that has been 
impossible for most to meet 
however in what some veterans see as a partial admission of 
responsibility the va has provided free medical care to anyone who 
believes he or she became ill because of agent orange 
under derwinskis new orders the department of veterans affairs 
has begun redrafting its guidelines for disability benefits 
starting by changing the way in which it determines whether a 
significant statistical association exists between agent orange 
and a disease 
a scientific advisory committee planned to review the proposed 
changes at a meeting today with changes to be published in the 
federal register derwinski will make a final decision on the 
changes probably in october 
once new guidelines are in place the vas advisory committee 
will reconsider whether links exist between agent orange and 
diseases that veterans believe it has caused again a final 
decision will be up to derwinski 
the stakes are high as the makers of agent orange can attest 
after veterans filed a lawsuit against them seven chemical 
companies settled out of court for 180 million in 1984 
derwinski has said cost is irrelevant to the vas stance 
disability benefits which are independent of medical benefits or 
social security currently range from 73 a month for a veteran who 
is 10 percent disabled to 1468 a month for a veteran who is 100 
percent disabled 
if just 30000 veterans were found to be 10 percent disabled the 
cost to the government would be more than 26 million a year 
for that reason alone some veterans advocates say they doubt 
the va will adopt sweeping changes 
the va would literally be opening the doors to tens of 
thousands of claims said sparrow i just dont see how they 
could do it 
fred juarbe director of the national veterans service program 
for the veterans of foreign wars commended derwinski for taking a 
step in the right direction 
still juarbe said i think the bottom line is were still 
going to require legislation given the way the va has ruled in 
the past were not confident that we can rely on the department of 
veterans affairs to carry out this policy 
one such piece of legislation was introduced in congress earlier 
this month a bill by sens john kerry dmass alan cranston 
dcalif and tom daschle dsd would provide disability benefits 
for veterans who have nonhodgkins lymphoma or softtissue sarcoma 
two of the diseases associated with agent orange 
it is time to end the bickering over which study shows the most 
connection between agent orange and certain illnesses and time to 
begin helping vietnam veterans said kerry a former navy 
lieutenant who skippered a patrol boat in the mekong delta 
george claxton a former army sergeant who was along with maier 
one of the original plaintiffs in the san francisco lawsuit against 
the va said he is optimistic about prospects for change 
i just want the satisfaction of seeing that people are treated 
with justice and compassion said claxton 46 of lansing mich 
who believes his exposure to agent orange caused bleeding colitis 
and a nervous disorder 
however he added personally i dont ever expect to be paid 
back for what agent orange did to me you pay a heavy price for 
war

one mans life work is hypnotizing frogs 
into pumping iron and one woman used to get her paycheck from bozo 
the clown 
are we a little kooky asks frog mesmerist bill steed look 
at it this way we work when we want to work we make a fairly 
decent living we make people happy and were happy ourselves 
psychologist david weeks agrees in an upcoming book he says 
such people are among eccentric americans who share many positive 
qualities 
many of their personality traits add up to a very good recipe 
for human happiness said weeks of the royal hospital in 
edinburgh scotland 
true eccentrics he said have a sense of humor intense 
curiosity a high sense of integrity and a desire to make the world 
better or at least happier 
weeks has been studying offbeat people for the past five years 
and in an earlier book eccentrics the scientific 
investigation focused on europeans his new book is about 
americans and about half his estimated 1000 subjects are from 
california 
weeks doesnt believe californians are by nature flaky but 
california seems to take pride in its oddballs he said in an 
interview published in sundays san jose mercury news 
its very tolerant and proud and nurturing of eccentricity 
he said in some parts of the world by contrast eccentricity is 
denigrated in sydney for example they call them ratbags not in 
california 
among weeks subjects was steed who lives in emeryville across 
the bay bridge from san francisco and has toured the fair circuit 
with 40 frogs and many laughs 
his hypnotized frogs lie on their backs and lift tiny barbells 
with their front legs 
diana stoneberg is another californian who became one of weeks 
subjects 
a former writer for chicagos bozo the clown television show 
stoneberg said being eccentric is quite complimentary 
id rather go down as an eccentric than as a routine normal 
person she says 
sandra miner of los angeles is an artist who sells religious 
television programming from her home she says her eccentricity is 
meant to make everyone laugh and get a giggle 
one time she said she tried to get a giggle out of the 
postmaster general of the united states by poking her finger in his 
stomach and saying ding ding ding 
weeks 45 whose scottish accent belies his new jersey birth 
says eccentrics are curious because theyre committed to whatever 
theyre doing 
but theirs is not a neurotic preoccupation because theyre not 
really concerned about what other people think about them he said

nearly six years after an army 
firing squad killed prime minister maurice bishop after a military 
coup 17 people accused in the slaying still await a final verdict 
bishops death in a factional struggle within his ruling party 
helped lead to the us invasion of the island in 1983 the 
prisoners claim they were convicted in a usbacked show trial to 
justify the invasion and eliminate the remaining inner circle of 
bishops marxist regime 
of the 16 men and one woman 14 are condemned to hang for murder 
three soldiers charged with the actual shooting face decades in 
prison for manslaughter 
however the prisoners are asking the court of appeal grenadas 
highest court to throw out their december 1986 convictions for the 
killing of bishop and several supporters 
their appeal has been dragging on since may 1988 straining the 
tiny islands treasury and the patience of many of the nations 
90000 residents who have little sympathy for the prisoners 
the people are fed up with it said leslie pierre editor of 
the grenadian voice an independent weekly newspaper its been 
going on and on and on they want it finished with 
the original high court trial lasted nearly eight months and it 
took a year to produce a 9000page court record the 13 defense 
lawyers won a sixmonth delay to prepare the appeal 
seven months into the appeal the president of the threejudge 
court died and the appeal had to start again with a new president 
at the current pace it will go on through fall because the 
sixlawyer prosecution team hasnt even started its case 
meanwhile the grenadian government is paying court costs as well 
as the fees and expenses of the 10 jamaican lawyers representing 
those prisoners who claimed indigency 
so far the case has cost the government 27 million or 5 
percent of the nations annual 55 million budget 
its bleeding us but were prepared to spend that sort of 
money so that we can say look at the sacrifice were prepared 
to make to give the defendants a fair trial said justice 
minister danny williams 
the killing of bishop a popular prime minister resulted from a 
dispute over leadership of his radical peoples revolutionary 
government a hardline revolutionary military council led by 
bernard coard took control and placed the prime minister under 
house arrest 
on oct 19 1983 hundreds of bishop supporters converged on his 
residence and set him free 
however troop reinforcements rushed in allegedly on orders of 
the military council 
bishop three members of his cabinet including his pregnant 
mistress education minister jacqueline cleft and four other 
people were lined up against a wall and shot by three soldiers a 
witness said one assailant slit bishops throat long after he was 
clearly dead and also cut off a finger to steal a ring 
president reagan ordered the invasion involving 1900 us troops 
and small forces from other carribean island nations he said he 
wanted to protect the lives of about 1000 us citizens in grenada 
and help restore democracy 
those on death row include coard grenadas former deputy prime 
minister his wife phyllis the former armed forces commander gen 
hudson austin and the former ambassador to cuba leon cornwall

a situation that they themselves created

three months have passed and the sea still 
coughs up dead birds with every change of the tide 
three months have passed and an army of workers 9000 strong has 
yet to completely clean even one heavily oiled beach 
three months have passed and the biggest oil spill in us 
history gets bigger every day spreading its slime farther across 
alaskas wild southern coast pushing its poison deeper and higher 
along the food chain 
we keep hoping for some kind of closure some sign that this is 
all the damage we have and we can deal with it says anne 
castellina superintendent of kenai fjords national park but we 
cant the oil disappears one day when the waves clean a beach only 
to wash up on another beach the next day 
prince william sounds bountiful waters and mountainous islands 
were the first to be fouled after the tanker exxon valdez rammed a 
reef march 24 and spilled almost 11 million gallons of north slope 
crude oil 
but the damage didnt stop there streamers of oil and tar balls 
leaked out between the sounds barrier islands and were pushed by 
gulf of alaska currents to beaches 450 miles away 
oil now has tainted more than 700 miles of shoreline from the 
glaciercarved cliffs of kenai fjords to the clamoring bird 
rookeries of katmai national park from lonely cook inlet beaches to 
the mouths of kodiak island salmon streams 
cleanup workers have found the oilsoaked bodies of about 26000 
sea birds 784 sea otters and 57 bald eagles the spreading oil has 
other victims fishermen and other coastal residents who make their 
living from the ocean cringe each week at news of more beaches 
polluted and more fishing grounds closed 
the wreck of the exxon valdez created an environmental 
catastrophe that unfolds in one little tragedy after another 
a wildlife official filming damage on a beach sets a video 
cassette down on a black rock and the rock crawls away it turns 
out to be an oilsmeared duck 
a burly fisherman breaks into tears as he describes steering his 
boat through the slick no water lapping no birds crying just the 
sickening silence of oil slipping past the hull 
at a bird rescue center in seward some of the patients are 
failing they have been washed clean but not before swallowing 
fatal doses of oil they dont cry out instinct tells them not to 
advertise their distress to predators they just get real quiet 
sit in a corner and die says rescue coordinator jay holcomb 
like a candy bar in the hands of a 2yearold crude oil from the 
exxon valdez has gotten onto everything 
rainbow sheens on the water stream from suffocating mats of black 
goop on beaches wind and waves whip oil into a sticky froth that 
workers call chocolate mousse tar balls bob in the surf 
washing ashore to melt in the sun and sink into the sand oil 
splatters driftwood logs high above the tide line and sinks as much 
as 3 feet into gravel beaches undulating blobs of oil hang below 
the waters surface ready to foul fishermens nets 
at first exxon boldly promised to clean it all up 
were going to pick up one way or the other all the oil 
thats out there exxon spokesman don cornett told reporters one 
week after the exxon valdez ran aground 
the promise didnt keep for long 
exxon was too slow and the spill was too big for booms to contain 
the oil immediately after the accident and the company missed its 
chance during the first few days to burn off large quantities of oil 
or disperse it with chemicals some oil was skimmed up but for the 
most part exxon had to wait for oil to wash up on shore where the 
goo could be scraped wiped or flushed painstakingly from rocks and 
gravel 
by may 1 the cleanitall promise had been modified exxon 
proposed to clean 364 miles of coastline by midseptember noting 
that it might have to leave 191 additional miles of lightly oiled 
shore to be washed by nature 
the coast guard approved exxons plan but even the limited 
cleanup may prove beyond the companys capability despite an 
investment of more than 200 million to date 
the cleanup effort now includes more than 9000 workers 800 
boats 45 oil skimmers and 60 airplanes and helicopters hundreds 
of workers clad in rain slickers and hard hats crowd into coves that 
in most years might see a few fishermen or recreational boaters if 
anyone at all 
barges nose up to shore carrying generators and boilers to heat 
the water sprayed from hoses on the beach skimmers just offshore 
pick up oil as it flushes off the beach while yet more vessels tend 
containment booms to keep the washedoff oil from spreading 
where there isnt enough machinery workers hit the beaches with 
shovels absorbent pads and plastic bags scooping and scraping and 
wiping by hand 
it has become pretty laborintensive says exxon spokesman 
amos plante 
the coast guard which is overseeing exxons cleanup effort has 
signed off on about 50 miles of shoreline along prince william 
sound but that doesnt mean a beach is clean it just means exxon 
can move on even the most intensive scrubbing cannot touch oil 
imbedded deep within a beach 
the word clean is now taboo on official forms used to track 
exxons efforts workers dont clean beaches anymore they treat 
them 
the difference is more than semantics as a visit to a prince 
william sound beach with a state environmental official shows 
this says steve provant as he kicks an oily rock is a 
treated beach 
provant the onscene cleanup coordinator for the alaska 
department of environmental conservation is standing on a green 
island beach known to officials as gr1a the coast guard signed off 
on this beach may 29 declaring that exxon crews had completed 
removal of gross contamination provant saw it back then and it 
looked pretty good he says 
but now the oil is back globs of mousse litter the cobbled 
beach rainwater beads up on the rocks as it would on the waxed hood 
of a car provant digs into the sand and his hand comes up greasy 
brown 
if you dig you find oil down quite a ways provant says 
you can see how much oil has been washed back in or has percolated 
up from below were really not through with this beach 
provants agency hounds exxon suggesting ways the cleanup could 
run more efficiently exxon state and federal officials spend hours 
each day arguing over how deeply to clean particular beaches or 
whether cleaning them will do more harm than good 
everybody wants a clean beach us included says exxons 
plante the definition of clean is subject to interpretation what 
were obviously going to do is work as hard to do the best job we 
can we may have some disagreements over whether its sufficiently 
clean

while the arguments rage onshore the death toll mounts at sea 
stymied by vast distances and stormy weather bird rescuers have 
been able to capture clean and release only about 500 sea birds 
for every surviving bird more than 50 dead ones lie in freezer vans 
more than 26000 in all and thats just a fraction of total 
mortality some biologists say that for every dead bird collected 
perhaps 100 have died unnoticed 
sea otters appear to be the hardesthit marine mammal the 784 
dead sea otters collected so far represent about onetenth of prince 
william sounds total population harbor seals may be suffering 
too but few carcasses have been found dead seals sink like lead 
balloons explains state marine biologist kathy frost 
the oils lethal reach extends down the food chain on some 
beaches mats of oil have wiped out all life suffocating intertidal 
creatures such as limpets mussels crabs and starfish 
and the oil reaches upward to the tops of tall shoreside spruce 
trees where bald eagles roost oiled sea birds have become a fatal 
attraction for scavenging eagles killing 57 of the birds of prey 
biologists have collected lifeless eggs from 30 abandoned eagle 
nests in the spill area 
hungry brown bears on the shores of katmai national park have 
feasted on oily bird carcasses until they could eat no more digging 
holes in the sand to cache the leftovers 
bears are hardy creatures but biologists have radiocollared 30 
of them to study their reaction to swallowing so much oil we 
havent determined what effect it has on them but i can imagine 
what it would do to me says katmai national park superintendent 
ray bane 
at the very top of the food chain are the humans who live close 
to nature in coastal villages when aleut natives complained that 
the oil spill kept them from gathering food through fishing and 
sealhunting exxon flew in cases of beef chicken and diced ham it 
gave the villagers stomachaches 
many commercial fishermen have been idled by the spill though 
some have landed jobs with exxon leasing their boats at rates of 
3400 a day and more 
most of the salmon and halibut swimming beneath the oil appear to 
be surviving but fisheries worth more than 110 million have been 
canceled or postponed by alaska officials worried that surface oil 
might taint fish as they are hauled from the water in fishermens 
nets 
as spring turns to summer even exxon officials are starting to 
waver on the question of finishing the cleanup by midseptember a 
deadline long dismissed as unrealistic by some state and federal 
officials 
its always a hope says exxons plante but its tougher 
to predict whether well do it by then thats our plan weve 
always said we will not leave it uncleaned and if that means coming 
back so be it 
the sooner the better for all concerned particularly for 120 
frisky sea otters now swimming restlessly in floating pens theyve 
beaten the odds thanks to rescuers at an otter hospital in seward 
the animals are clean healthy and ready to return to the wild 
but they must stay put biologists say because the wild is not 
ready for them

oregon voters face a measure tuesday 
that urges congress to let the state halt shipments of raw logs 
overseas when domestic lumber mills are starving for timber and 
workers jobs are jeopardized 
the ballot proposal called measure 2 seeks to ban export of 
logs cut on state land and calls on congress to make permanent a ban 
of export of logs cut on federal land 
both supporters and opponents view measure 2 as a symbolic test 
of the public will with jobs at mills jeopardized by both the high 
prices for raw logs and by environmentalist lawsuits aimed at 
protecting the rare northern spotted owl and the ancient forests 
where they live 
this is the first opportunity anybody in the united states has 
had to say we want timber jobs we need timber jobs thats really 
the issue on tuesday said doug stout vice president for lands 
and timber for bohemia inc a lumber company in eugene that has 
contributed 100000 in support of measure 2 
but because of a us supreme court ruling on the same issue five 
years ago the options of oregon voters are strictly limited the 
high court ruled that only congress has the right to restrict trade 
declaring an oregon law banning log exports unconstitutional 
because of the ruling congress would have to pass enabling 
legislation for the state export ban to become effective even if it 
is passed tuesday as most expect it will 
the bush administration is seeking just the opposite having 
proposed to lift a ban of exports of logs cut on federal land 
currently in effect on a yeartoyear basis to take advantage of 
premium prices paid by log buyers in china japan and korea 
within the timber industry itself opinions are mixed many 
companies make money exporting unprocessed logs while others are 
struggling obtain logs for their mills 
the pacific rim trade association which opposes export 
restrictions has decided to concentrate its efforts on defeating 
the enabling legislation in congress rather than seeking victory in 
tuesdays referendum said association executive director rolf 
glerum 
we didnt feel we could raise the money to fight measure 2 
said glerum even if we were to win it it still wouldnt have any 
effect the whole thing is triggered by the congress 
the groups members include weyerhaeuser co the leading 
exporter of raw logs in the northwest as well as stevedoring 
companies shippers and the international longshoremens and 
warehousemens union 
one reason we oppose this is we feel it is the camels nose 
under the tent said glerum because supporters would just as 
soon see all log exports banned 
indeed a recent white paper from the oregon natural resources 
council pointed to stopping all log exports as a quick fix to the 
timber supply crunch that has plagued northwest mills the past year 
glerum and other opponents expect measure 2 to pass a recent 
poll by the oregonian newspaper showed support running more than 
8to1 
a campaign spending report from may 26 showed citizens to save 
oregon jobs raised nearly 800000 to push for passage primarily 
from nonexporting timber companies 
were talking primarily about oregon logs for oregon jobs 
said pat amedeo a lobbyist who serves on the steering committee for 
the campaign the big battle because it is a nontraditional 
election date is to get enough voters to the polls 
i think in terms of sending a message back to washington dc 
which is part of what the ballot measure does the more people who 
vote the more significant the message 
state rep bernie agrons was one of the few voices in the 
legislature opposing the measure 
a former vice president of weyerhaeuser agrons said the measure 
would deprive the common school fund and counties of revenues from 
state timber 
last year 125 million in state timber revenues went to the 
common school fund and 183 million went to local governments 
predominantly schools export logs are generally considered to bring 
a premium price about 25 percent higher than domestic logs

mayor tom bradley prepared to be sworn in 
friday for an unprecedented fifth term but investigations into his 
finances and ethics are putting a damper on party plans 
the inaugural party to be held on the south lawn of city hall 
is expected to be a day of celebration and at the same time 
reflection said bill chandler a mayoral spokesman 
the 71yearold bradley rose through the ranks of the police 
department and city council to become the first black mayor of a 
major us city when he defeated sam yorty in 1973 following a 
bitter campaign 
these days bradley points with pride to the citys emergence as 
the gateway to the pacific rim as the successful host of the 1984 
summer olympic games and to a downtown redevelopment effort 
in aprils nonpartisan primary he defeated city councilman nate 
holden with 52 percent of the vote just enough to avoid a general 
election 
bradley was expected to soar past holden but found himself 
wounded by disclosures about his financial ties with savings banks 
that do business with the city 
newspaper reports prompted the city attorney to begin a 
conflictofinterest investigation on march 31 the state fair 
political practices commission later joined the investigation 
deeper digging into bradleys investments yielded questions about 
whether he had traded political favors for preferential treatment at 
drexel burnham lambert the investment banking firm this in turn 
prompted inquiries by the us justice department and the securities 
and exchange commission 
in a surprise address to the city council on may 10 the taciturn 
bradley said he made an error in judgment by engaging in outside 
employment but bradley maintained he did nothing illegal and 
said he expects to be vindicated in the stillpending inquiries 
since the speech bradley has maintained silence about details of 
his investments denying interview requests 
the spurt of disclosures about bradley appears to have tapered 
off in recent weeks although investigations apparently have gone in 
new directions one trail which ran to drexel investments by house 
majority whip tony coelho led the california democrat to resign 
bradleys amalgam of labor minority and business support has 
remained largely intact throughout the controversy although his 
influence over the city council has diminished 
some say one barometer of the mayors strength is with his 
proposal to the council last year to raise the cap on community 
redevelopment agency spending downtown to 5 billion from 750 
million the money would be spent on revitalizating blighted parts 
of downtown expanding child care services for the homeless and 
building affordable housing for lowincome residents 
the council is considering creating an oversight committee for 
the agency cutting into the mayors control a hearing is scheduled 
for tuesday to discuss how much power such a committee would have 
even bradleys friends say the mayor doesnt hold as much clout 
as he once did 
theres no question that bradley has been tarnished by the 
many stories some of which i regard as frivolous and some bordering 
on yellow journalism said william robertson executive secretary 
of the los angeles aflcio and a longtime bradley political ally 
its been my experience that politicians and especially a 
powerful politician when hes in trouble the sharks smell the 
blood and they go for the jugular robertson said 
but robertson has continued to support bradley calling him a 
person of high integrity 
judgments shouldnt be made until all the issues have all been 
thoroughly explored he said 
there is not a feeling that its all over bradley confidante 
richard riordan said of the mayors career hes held his head up 
high through all of this 
still riordan conceded you have a feeling underneath that he 
knows that hes walking more carefully and not twisting arms as 
forcefully as he mightve in the past

in a pinch you can fly a plane 
at least thats what instructors in a unique eighthour flying 
course try to convince pilots spouses and others who might be 
forced to fly and land a plane in an emergency 
it is rare for a heart attack food poisoning or other sudden 
illness to disable a pilot in midflight but it happens once or 
twice a year and sometimes with dramatic results as air traffic 
controllers help a novice find an airport and safely land 
the ground school instructor in a recent course sponsored by the 
aircraft owners and pilots associations air safety foundation asked 
anne kennedy 52 of graysonville md how she felt about the 
prospect of taking the controls of her husbands mooney 201 
im scared to death she said 
but after four hours of flying with an instructor in the 
pinchhitter course that has taught 35000 nonpilots the 
fundamentals of flying mrs kennedy said i feel a lot different 
about our little plane i think i understand it better 
while the course covers only small planes bob carter who is in 
charge of flight instruction for the foundation said that in the 
unlikely event an airliners flying crew was disabled hed go 
with the odds and ask a trained pinchhitter to take the controls 
one student described herself as a former stewardess and said she 
took the course because if you can work the back end of a plane 
you should be able to work the front end 
another trainee julie zuckerman of bradford pa told the class 
that after her husbands parents were killed in the crash of their 
small plane her husband david stopped flying for more than 10 
years 
she bounced the familys piper archer twice on the runway before 
bringing it down undamaged with a little help from her pinchhitter 
instructor 
i thought it was nervewracking mrs zuckerman said but i 
loved taking off i never thought it was so easy and so much fun i 
think i could land it if i had to 
martha carter of scranton pa who survived a crash with her 
husband four years ago said she thinks the course is a necessity 
for a pilots wife but after the crash it took him a while to 
convince her to take the class she said 
once in the air people who have never flown a plane find it 
deceptively simple a push forward on the steering yoke and the 
aircraft descends a pull back and it climbs steering left or right 
is almost like steering a car but on the ground steering is done 
by foot pedals not the yoke 
engine speed is controlled with a hand throttle but trainees 
often forget that putting the plane into a descent will also speed 
it up and climbing will slow it down 
the fourhour ground school aims to build confidence but it also 
includes a basic explanation of what makes a plane fly and a 
description of its parts and instruments 
started in 1961 the weekend course is taught about 20 times a 
year each time at a different airport around the country 
richard busch flight training director for the foundation said 
about a third of the trainees go on to get pilot licenses only a 
handful ever actually have to fly with a disabled pilot busch said 
in 1983 pinchhitter graduate jane turner of phoenix was in the 
right rear seat of her husbands plane when he suffered a heart 
attack and died a 78yearold woman edith merrill was sitting by 
the rightside controls but the owners and pilots group gave mrs 
turner an award for taking over the radio and coaching and assisting 
mrs merrill through a safe landing 
it takes 40 to 60 hours of flying to qualify for a regular pilot 
license and costs 3500 to 4000 
the pinchhitter training costs 240 not including use of an 
aircraft trainees are encouraged to use the plane they regularly 
ride in as a passenger but they also may rent one 
ideally the course culminates in the pinchhitter landing the 
plane unassisted by the instructor 
im not really sure how much control i had over the plane in 
that final landing mrs kennedy said after completing the course 
if god help me the time ever comes when i have to fly on my 
own then well god help me she said

eightyfive percent of the 1431 voting residents rejected a

senators facing reelection in 1990 have cut 
down on privately financed travel that sometimes takes them to 
pricey resorts according to a study of financial disclosures 
the group comprising almost a third of the senate took 179 
privately financed trips in 1988 compared with 223 in 1987 
such travel usually paid for by corporate and trade 
associations has been severely criticized this year by members of 
congress and private organizations 
the associated press study of 33 senators was based on travel 
statistics compiled on the full senate by congress watch an 
organization founded by consumer advocate ralph nader that culled 
the data from 1988 senate financial disclosure reports filed last 
month 
senators are required to list all reimbursed travel expenses 
totaling at least 250 the lawmakers were not surveyed on why the 
number of trips dropped 
while legal the trips leave members in potential conflicts of 
interest involving special interest groups that are pushing for 
passage or defeat of legislation the invitations often include 
airfare several days at a resort or topoftheline hotel and 
expenses for a spouse 
task forces in both houses are considering whether to eliminate 
speaking honoraria in return for a congressional pay raise but an 
end of those fees up to 2000 per speech would not necessarily 
prevent privately funded travel 
many of these junkets are designed to give lobbyists the chance 
to fraternize with lawmakers frequently at pricey resorts and 
provide special interest groups with yet another opportunity to gain 
access and influence with members of congress said joan 
claybrook head of congress watchs parent group public citizen 
those who traveled frequently however probably have little to 
fear from the voters according to two political scientists norman 
ornstein associated with the american enterprise institute and james 
a thurber of american university 
i dont think it will be a devastatingly effective campaign 
weapon in 1990 said ornstein unless the travel has caused a 
senator to miss votes 
youre going to have much more luck slamming a guy for doing it 
on public expense than at the expense of private interests 
ornstein said the public reaction is we dont give a damn if 
its taken out of special interests but dont take it out of our 
pockets 
thurber said there were few studies on voters reaction to 
congressional trips but added it was his gut reaction that the 
trips play almost no role in the way they evaluate the performance 
of a member of congress 
the ap found that among those whose current sixyear terms are 
winding down 
eighteen traveled on fewer privately paid trips in 1988 than in 
1987 while 10 increased their travel and five had the same number 
of trips in both years the ratio becomes 189 in favor of reduced 
travel when sens william armstrong dcolo and gordon humphrey 
rnh are subtracted from the list both have announced their 
retirement 
the gap in the number of trips is greater 164 in 1988 compared 
with 223 in 1987 without sen james a mcclure ridaho who listed 
no trips in 1987 and 15 in 1988 
six senators facing reelection were among the top 15 privately 
financed travelers in the senate they are democrats joseph r biden 
jr of delaware 24 trips j james exon of nebraska 23 trips j 
bennett johnston of louisiana 21 trips sam nunn of georgia 21 
trips and republicans mark hatfield of oregon 24 trips and alan 
k simpson of wyoming 21 trips 
public citizen found that all senators took more than 1100 
privately financed trips during the 100th congress led by john 
breaux dla with 37 orrin g hatch rutah 34 alan cranston 
dcalif 33 dale bumpers dark 30 and majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine 29 
senators who did not accept privately paid travel during the 
period were sens lloyd bentsen dtexas robert byrd dwva john 
danforth rmo humphrey and jay rockefeller dwva

communist rebels raided a mountain 
village in a remote area of mindanao island and massacred about 30 
people as they worshipped in a protestant church the military said 
monday 
the raiders beheaded three people including a protestant 
minister before fleeing the report said 
lt col cresencio maralit spokesman for the philippine 
constabulary said the incident occurred early sunday in the village 
of rano about 640 miles southeast of manila 
maralit said many of the villagers had joined an anticommunist 
vigilante group and had refused to pay revolutionary taxes to 
the communist new peoples army 
according to maralit about 40 members of the ubo and bagobo 
tribes had gathered inside a united church of christ chapel for 
morning worship when about 100 guerrillas arrived 
guerrillas exchanged gunfire for about 15 minutes with members of 
the congregation who were armed maralit said 
maralit identified the dead pastor as abadi ayap but a 
denomination official in manila said records indicated no such 
pastor by that name 
bishop erme camba secretarygeneral of the denomination said 
the victim could have been a lay pastor the bishop said he was 
still trying to verify the report 
the united church of christ has been widely criticized by the 
military for alleged links with communist rebels because of the 
denominations outspoken stand on human rights 
in the past most beheadings in mindanao have been carried out by 
religious fanatics who are frequently used by the military to fight 
the communists

at 400 pounds sen dixon hall lewis of alabama 
was the weightiest person ever to serve in congress 
lewis a democrat who served first in the house then in the 
senate was so heavy he had difficulty finding a carriage driver 
willing to take the risk of hauling all those pounds 
once wrote isaac bassett the senates assistant doorkeeper for 
much of the 19th century lewis got into a hack and went right 
through the bottom onto the ground and if the horses had not been 
very tame he would have been killed 
sen lewis and the extreme rotundity of his profile is 
presiding this summer over the marbleclad rotunda of the russell 
senate office building looming from a balcony in the form of a 
giant shadowcasting silhouette 
lewis and the silhouettes of six of his senatorial colleagues of 
his era form the somewhat whimsical background of an exhibit 
illustrating the triumph and travail experienced by the senate in 
its first 100 years 17891889 
born in 1802 lewis served in the house for 15 years he was 
appointed to the senate in 1844 dying four years later 
bassett who made good use of his powers of observation during 
his 60 years of service to the senate noted that lewis rarely rose 
from his specially constructed and commodious chair to address the 
senate 
bassett wrote that lewis told him the reason was that he was so 
big and fat that i would have to fan him and it would not look very 
dignified in such a body as the senate 
but if lewis was an infrequent speaker he did listen intently to 
the major addresses of others 
on jan 26 1830 he walked across the capitol and joined the 
throng crowding into the chamber of the senate determined to hear 
sen daniel webster of massachusetts defend the federal union 
the enormous congressman was given a seat in the tiny lobby 
behind the presiding officers chair where he became wedged in by 
other spectators 
because he was separated from the chamber by a painted glass 
screen he could hear webster but could not see him 
describing the scene bassett said the frustrated congressman 
deliberately pulled out his knife and removed the obstructing 
paint on the glass 
but the operation caused quite a noise bassett said 
everybody was looking to see where that scratching came from 
finally bassett said lewis cleared an area as large as a 
mans hand obtaining a good view of the famous webster 
the senatorial silhouettes originally made on paper during the 
1840s and 1850s and now reproduced larger than life bring together 
an unuusal cast of characters 
joining lewis in largerthanlife profile is for example sen 
john randolph of virginia a thin sticklike figure described as 
one of the most brilliant deranged and pathetic men ever to serve 
in the senate 
randolph was known to stride into the senate followed by a pack 
of hunting hounds while flicking a riding crop and drinking a cup of 
beer 
abusive in speech he once provoked a duel with sen henry clay 
from which both men emerged unscathed 
randolph lived to be 99 dying in 1833 just days before his 100th 
birthday 
also on the railing above the rotunda floor is a far less 
colorful lawmaker sen felix grundy of tennessee who was described 
by doorkeeper bassett as a consummate insider and master of 
parliamentary tactics 
near grundy is sen john forsyth of georgia who cut a more 
visible public swath with blistering oratory and cutting wit 
informed that president andrew jacksons opponents were forming 
the new whig party forsyth remarked 
it is a glorious name and i have no doubt they will disgrace 
it

the holy grail may not exist but its a 
proven moneymaker 
scholars say the makers of the blockbuster movie indiana jones 
and the last crusade are just the latest to cash in on the search 
for the impossible icon 
a 12th century abbot was the first to claim he had found the cup 
that jesus used at the last supper and his monastery became the 
wealthiest in england according to eckehard simon professor of 
germanic medieval literature at harvard university 
the grail has since inspired romantic poems in several languages 
a wagner opera and even a monty python movie 
but it hadnt been a subject for archaeologists until filmmakers 
steven spielberg and george lucas decided to dispatch their 
swashbuckling searcher for antiquities played by harrison ford 
in the movie dr indiana jones sets out in search of his father 
sean connery who has disappeared while hunting for the holy 
grail together they outsmart nazi plunderers who are after the 
grail because they believe anyone who drinks from it will gain 
immortality 
the truth about the holy grail is tangled in centuries of legend 
stretching from the druids to adolf hitler 
indiana jones screenwriter jeffrey boam said the different 
strands of grail lore were so contradictory he chose among them and 
made up the rest 
the three knights guarding the cup are boams creation for 
example as is the notion that the grail could not be taken from its 
resting place in an ancient temple in jordan 
there is however some evidence that the nazis were interested 
in the grail 
hitler used it in speeches as a metaphor for aryan racial purity 
boam said lucas discovered hitlers interest in occult artifacts 
while making raiders of the lost ark boams research turned up 
reports that the nazis had looted a monastery in france in hopes of 
finding the grail 
simon and other scholars said the grail myth flourished in 12th 
century england though it has roots in earlier celtic mythology 
according to the legend joseph of arimathea used the chalice 
from which jesus served the wine at the last supper to catch his 
blood during the crucifixion 
the apocryphal story has it that joseph eventually brought the 
grail to the monastery of glastonbury a tale the abbot of 
glastonbury henry de blois promoted 
if you had a precious relic people would come on 
pilgrimages simon said they also managed to fabricate the 
story that king arthur was buried there and also that they had 
excalibur arthurs sword 
it was a tremendous publicity stunt and it made glastonbury 
the single wealthiest monastery in england until the reformation 
he added 
grail tales also were written in medieval french and german 
one legend had the grail coming to rest in the south of france 
and by the 15th century a french king had a collection of grail 
cups according to popular book on the subject holy blood holy 
grail 
a german version inspired richard wagner to write the opera 
parsifal in 1882 
hollywood took up the trail in 1954 when paul newman played a 
sculptor who made the cup for jesus in the silver chalice 
there is however no evidence the grail existed simon said 
the metropolitan museum of art in new york does have a figured 
silver cup that was once said to be the grail the antioch chalice 
discovered in syria in about 1910 was exhibited at the 1938 worlds 
fair said curator jane hayward of the cloisters which once owned 
it but the chalice was made 500 years after jesus birth and

a kansasbased company faces a criminal 
investigation based on allegations that it stole oil from 
indianowned wells according to a spokesman for a senate committee 
the justice department probe stems from information about koch 
industries inc gathered by a special investigating committee of the 
senate select committee on indian affairs spokesman sam hirsch said 
this has been referred to the us attorney george pearson 
a spokesman for koch based in wichita kan 
pearson said koch officials and representatives of the us 
attorney in oklahoma city will meet before a formal investigation 
begins although no date has been set for the meeting 
assistant us attorney nancy jones in oklahoma city said her 
office can neither confirm nor deny the existence of an ongoing 
investigation 
the special senate committee focused on koch the countrys 
largest independent oil purchaser at a may 10 hearing in which 
witnesses said koch employees purposely mismeasured oil from wells 
on indian lands 
in a 57page statement issued june 8 koch said the committee 
unjustly defamed koch and caused severe damage to its reputation 
and business 
the 49yearold company said the figures the committee used in 
its allegations were inaccurate and that comparisons with other 
companies were based on noncomparable statistics 
the committee used anecdotal evidence which was misleading at 
best and false at worst at the hearing the koch statement said 
but hirsch said the committee stands by its findings 
the committees investigators caught koch employees in the act 
of stealing oil on six separate occasions he said koch gaugers 
and supervisors also admitted to committee investigators that it was 
company policy to mismeasure oil 
hirsch said documents the committee subpoenaed from koch and 
almost 30 other companies corroborated the committees findings he 
said the committee will review kochs june 8 statement before making 
its final report sometime this fall 
the special committee has been investigating all areas of indian 
affairs and came upon the koch case while probing federal agencies 
assigned to protecting indian lands

zaire president mobotu sese sekos poor human 
rights record isnt deterring washington lobbyists from scrambling 
to represent the wealthy leader who visits washington this week 
people see mobutu as the gold at the end of the rainbow said 
ed van kloberg whose lobbying and public relations firm recently 
signed a twoyear contract to lobby for zaire government interests 
at 300000 
the effort to win mobutus approval provides a glimpse into the 
oftenmurky world of washington lobbyists where highpriced public 
relations consultants compete to put the best face on foreign 
leaders and businesses 
mobutu has reputedly amassed a large personal fortune during the 
24 years he has ruled zaire 
he is an appealing target for entrepreneurs claiming they can 
open doors for him in congress and get him favorable media coverage 
despite zaires poor human rights record and allegations of 
widespread corruption 
people promise mobutu they can change things here for him open 
doors and then they cant deliver said van kloberg who 
represents several third world countries with unpopular reputations 
in the united states 
his company has been seeking to bolster congressional support in 
advance of the mobutu visit especially in light of the shrinking 
budget for us aid to africa 
the competition to represent foreign leaders sometimes leaves 
congressional staffers and state department officials confused such 
as when they were told several months ago by two rival lobbying 
firms that each was organizing mobutus visit 
their confusion was compounded when it transpired that the better 
known and more prestigious of the two the partnership of black 
manafort stone and kelly had not been picked but officials at 
that company say they are still negotiating to represent mobutu 
lobbyists representing foreign governments must register with the 
justice department where the files show that many contracts to 
represent zaire lasted only a year 
its not unusual for governments to switch lobbyists but the 
turnover rate for zaire is believed to be particularly high 
one company weaver international corporation was paid 500000 
just to promote foreign investment in flora and fauna culture 
projects in zaire 
aside from the paid lobbyists there is a network of unpaid 
officials many of them businessmen who know mobutu and take on 
tasks for him 
one example is mamadi diane whose company has a us government 
contract to ship food aid to several african countries diane helped 
set up a recent visit to zaire by 17 black mayors of us cities 
the trip paid for by zaires government may have done more 
damage than good it incurred the wrath of many black mayors opposed 
to mobutus repressive tactics and his ties with the white 
government of south africa

individuals and businesses will have more legal 
protection in disputes with the internal revenue service under 
provisions of the taxpayer bill of rights taking effect this 
week 
starting on saturday the irs will have to provide more advance 
notice before acting to seize property for back taxes and more 
wages and property will be exempt from seizure starting july 7 
taxpayers may appeal to block a seizure that was erroneously filed 
by the irs 
the provisions that take effect this week are aimed at helping 
taxpayers who owe delinquent taxes and are subject to irs collection 
procedures 
other parts of the new law already are in operation key 
provisions require the irs to provide taxpayers a written statement 
of their rights prohibit the agency from promoting employees on the 
basis of how much money they collect and require the irs to drop 
any penalty that resulted from a taxpayer relying on written advice 
from the agency 
the bill of rights was enacted last october after congressional 
committees compiled evidence of abuses by some irs officials and 
denial of basic rights to taxpayers although most taxpayers will 
never have a need for the new law since they will never be audited 
or receive a notice of delinquent taxes those who do run afoul of 
the irs may find it tips the balance a bit more in their favor 
sen david pryor dark chief author of the law once called it 
a measure basically geared for that small business that 
momandpop drugstore down on the corner that someday might get 
behind a little behind with their taxes or might want to say that i 
want to go in to the irs and admit a mistake that i just found 
without being penalized 
the accounting firm of pannell kerr forster put it another way 
the taxpayer bill of rights is an attempt to balance the rights 
and responsibilities in tax matters 
here are the key provisions about to take effect 
the irs will have to notify a taxpayer 30 days before filing a 
notice that it intends to levy or seize wages bank accounts or 
other property the old law required only a 10day notice if the 
taxes are still unpaid and the taxpayer has not worked out an 
installment payment plan when the 30 days are up the notice may be 
issued without further notification 
a bank must wait 21 days after receiving notice before turning 
an account over to the irs after that period the bank is free to 
hand over the money plus interest earned during the delay however 
the bank may not give the irs more than the total of the levy 
the agency noted that it has been automatically delaying seizures 
in cases in which there is any doubt as to the actual owner of the 
account the irs imposed this rule on itself after the widely 
publicized seizure of a childs small bank account that was listed 
with a parents social security number 
up to 1550 worth of food fuel furniture and personal 
household effects will be exempt from levy an increase of 50 
also 1050 worth of a workers tools of the trade are exempt 
up from 1000 the new law shields from seizure a bigger portion 
of a workers wages equal to the total of his or her standard 
deduction and personal exemptions divided by 52 
if a taxpayer believes a lien was filed erroneously for 
example because the irs did not follow the law or the delinquency 
was paid off before the lien was filed it may be appealed 
however there is no appeal if the taxpayer simply disputes the 
amount of alleged delinquency 
the irs can be sued for actual damages if the agency knowingly 
or negligently fails to remove a tax lien when required

the judge in oliver norths irancontra case 
faces a decision remarkably similar to one he made a decade ago in a 
case where a juror withheld significant information from the court 
us district judge gerhard a gesell has scheduled a hearing for 
wednesday focusing on north trial juror tara leigh kings failure to 
disclose that four of her brothers and sisters had been involved 
with the courts 
in a 1978 city corruption case gesell ordered a new trial for a 
top mayoral aide and parking lot magnate after it was disclosed that 
a juror had a checking account at a bank founded by the magnate 
dominic antonelli antonelli and his codefendant were acquitted in 
the retrial 
the juror also had failed to tell defense lawyers that her father 
worked for antonellis firm and had been fired from the company the 
juror said she hadnt known of his employment at antonellis firm 
although she acknowledged knowing her father was employed by another 
parking company in town 
in the north case king responded negatively on a pretrial 
questionnaire when asked whether she or any members of her immediate 
family had ever been involved in a court proceeding or in an 
investigation one brother had pleaded guilty to armed robbery 
gesell ordered norths lawyers who raised the allegations of 
juror misconduct against king to prepare a detailed account of when 
they learned of the information 
the prosecution says that under federal court rulings a defendant 
may not learn of alleged juror misconduct during a trial gamble 
on a favorable verdict by remaining silent and then complain in a 
posttrial motion 
north was convicted may 4 of aiding and abetting an obstruction 
of congress destroying government documents and accepting a 13800 
home security system as an illegal gratuity from richard secord 
north had enlisted secord to secretly run arms to the contras 
norths sentencing has been postponed until july 5 pending a 
decision on the matter 
in the 1978 case before gesell antonelli and joseph p yeldell 
an aide to thenwashington mayor walter e washington had been 
convicted of conspiring to arrange a government lease of a building 
from a partnership controlled by antonelli 
antonelli and yeldell now the director of the citys office of 
emergency preparedness were found innocent of bribery and 
conspiracy in their second trial before a federal court jury in 
philadelphia gesell presided in that trial as well 
antonelli was represented by edward bennett williams of the firm

threatening to lock up adults who dont 
lock up guns sends a strong message but police and prosecutors 
question whether a firstofits kind bill approved in florida will 
prevent accidental shootings 
we do feel there will be some difficulty in enforcement since 
it will take a child committing some dreadful act before law 
enforcement becomes aware that he or she had access to a weapon 
said tom berlinger director of operations for the florida sheriffs 
association 
monroe county state attorney kurt zuelch president of the 
florida prosecuting attorneys association also expressed concern 
that the prevention issue hasnt been totally dealt with 
accidental shootings that killed three children since june 5 
prompted the legislature to pass the bill during a special session 
tuesday gov bob martinez is expected to sign the measure into law 
this week 
gun owners who fail to secure loaded weapons in homes or 
businesses could face charges if children ages 15 and younger hurt 
someone with the firearms the maximum penalty under the bill would 
be five years in prison and a 5000 fine 
lesser penalties would apply if the child brandishes the gun in 
public or threatens others with it 
the bill exempts police officers and military personnel and does 
not apply in cases where the guns were obtained illegally such as a 
burglary 
the bill requires gunshop owners to post a sign explaining the 
law and to give customers a written warning the measure also 
directs the state department of education to develop a gunsafety 
education program that lawmakers can consider by next spring 
gun lobbyists were divided in their appraisal of the legislation 
what theyve got now is a public relations bill said william 
berger a sarasota resident who has urged passage of a stricter 
version of the legislation since march 1987 when his 9yearold 
stepson was accidentally killed by a friend 
berger was disappointed that the bill filed by rep harry 
jennings a retired army colonel was watered down but said 
getting a weaker version passed was still a battle won in that i 
know parents went out and bought a padlock 
bernard horn state legislative director of handgun control inc 
in washington called the bill a significant victory that would 
quickly save lives 
it makes people understand whats expected of them when they 
keep a loaded gun in the house with children horn said 
gunshop owners in florida say locks and safety boxes have gone 
from being overlooked accessories to one of the most soughtafter 
items since lawmakers passed the law 
but richard gardiner who directs state and local legislative 
affairs for the national rifle association in washington said the 
bill only repeats what is already covered in criminal negligence 
laws throughout the country 
we dont have any objection with it because it doesnt 
change anything he said 
gardiner said theres no need for the bill anywhere he said the 
nra would look at laws that may be proposed in other states 
individually 
handgun control plans to promote the florida bill as model 
legislation around the country according to horn the organization 
is chaired by sarah brady wife of president reagans press 
secretary jim brady who was shot in the 1981 assassination attempt 
on reagan 
a call for similar guncontrol action was made friday by 
wisconsin lt gov scott mccallum following a rash of shootings in 
that state lawmakers from about a dozen states have expressed 
interest in floridas legislation according to horn 
im sure that this is going to be introduced in quite a number 
of legislatures horn said and whats the nra going to do they 
cant say oh its not a good law for michigan or ohio or 
illinois when they agreed to it in florida 
firearms are the fourth leading cause of accidental deaths in 
children under age 16 according to the national safety council a 
private nonprofit organization automobile accidents drownings and 
fires are the top three

advocates of organic farming are generous in 
their praise saying it is a way for crop producers to make money 
and save the environment at the same time 
even the agriculture department which had been rather stodgy 
about producing wheat corn soybeans vegetables and other crops 
with reduced or eliminated doses of chemicals has adjusted 
numerous conferences and research efforts have marked usdas new 
journey into organic farming but it was congress in the 1985 farm 
law that really gave the department its marching orders along with 
a 4 million appropriation later on 
the department even used a new term low input sustainable 
agriculture or lisa to include what had been loosely referred to 
as organic sustainable or alternative methods of farming 
comparatively usda is doing much more today in programs to help 
small farmers and to assist both large and small producers find 
alternative methods of production by using less commercial 
fertilizer and pesticides it is hoped that producers can reduce 
costs and thereby improve profits 
but a washingtonbased nonprofit advocacy group the center for 
science in the public interest says organic and lowchemical 
farming is flourising at the state level while the federal 
effort is moving slowly 
a new study by the center found that half the states have 
significant activities to promote sustainable agriculture 
including strong efforts in california iowa maine minnesota 
texas and wisconsin 
here in washington proponents have to scratch and claw just to 
hang on to a tiny 445 million sustainable agriculture program that 
the bush administration and the chemical lobby want to kill said 
dan howell author of the centers report 
in contrast he said states are spending more money on a 
greater variety of ambitious programs to increase the production and 
marketing of foods grown with few or no synthetic pesticides and 
fertilizers 
other studies by advocates of lowinput agriculture support 
claims that crop yields often are comparable to those from 
chemically treated land after a practice has been established and 
crop rotation carried out 
but dean kleckner president of the american farm bureau 
federation said if it were as simple as reducing purchased 
inputs and reaping the rewards it would have been in practice years 
ago 
farmers are willing to adopt proven methods that result from the 
lowinput concept he recently told a senate agriculture 
subcommittee but the technology must be based on more than a whim 
and a promise 
farmers cannot afford to take big risks with a new and unproven 
technology kleckner said as we see it lisa programs represent 
a longterm goal for agriculture 
kleckner said some aspects of lisa have shown good results such 
as integrated pest management to reduce the amount of pesticides 
on crops by being more selective and careful about timing during the 
season 
in new york he said pest management reduced the amount of 
pesticide used on apples by 38 percent and on onions by 31 percent 
texas farmers were able to reduce pesticide use on carrots by 66 
percent and on cabbage by 44 percent 
at present kleckner said lowinput farming is still more a 
philosophy and spirit of farming than an easily defined set of 
principles

the agriculture department has some summer 
advice about dogs and cats 
that old bromide about hot weather discomfort tells us that 
horses sweat and men perspire and ladies gently glow says the 
departments animal and plant health inspection service if youre 
a pet owner however you should know that dogs and cats do none of 
the above 
instead they pant and agency experts say that can lead to 
deadly consequences if left unchecked 
each year hundreds of pets die of heat usually because their 
owners just arent aware of how quickly heat can kill said 
veterinarian dale schwindaman who heads the agencys animal care 
staff 
if you leash your dog outside make certain it can move easily 
to a shady spot make plenty of water available to it as well 
especially if youll be away from home for long periods 
pets should never be left unattended in a vehicle he said and 
cracking a window an inch or two will not adequately protect an 
animal heat in a car can rise to 160 degrees in a very short time 
as for car trips schwindaman said that for a highly nervous 
animal even a brief ride can be a severe strain in hot weather 
this is especially true if your pet is an indoor cat or dog who 
would be frightened simply by the surroundings and noise of an 
unfamiliar environment he said in this case if the trip is 
absolutely necessary the pet owner should make every effort to 
transport the animal in an airconditioned vehicle

formula contains dried whey and dried whey protein concentrate 
dried skimmed milk soy lecithin vitamins and minerals

zoning officials didnt object to the

jim onan put a 45foot statue of a pharoah on his front lawn 
the town took him to court under a zoning ordinance that puts a 
25foot limit on structures in residential neighborhoods 
the 52yearold onan a construction contractor decided on a way 
of getting around the regulation hes burying the 200ton statue of 
ramses ii in gravel up to its knees 
onan says he intends to spend 25000 to bury all but 25 feet of 
ramses ii 
i love it because theyre making a fool of themselves onan 
said in a telephone interview from his pyramid home friday 
the choice of ramses ii is fitting he ruled egypt from 1290 to 
1224 bc and was known for his ambitious building projects much 
like onan 
onan completed his 5storytall goldplated pyramid five years 
ago near wadsworth a town just south of the wisconsin border 
townspeople havent exactly rallied to onans defense in the 
statue case

federal health officials are concerned that 
each year more than 700000 nonnursing mothers are being put 
needlessly at risk with prescriptions for drugs and hormones to 
prevent painful breast swelling 
the food and drug administration plans to meet soon with several 
pharmaceutical companies to ask them to stop marketing the 
medications to prevent breast engorgement after childbirth 
an fda advisory council concluded earlier this month that mild 
painkillers and breastbinding are as effective as these medications 
in easing the discomfort and carry none of the health risks 
nature takes care of the problem very quickly usually within 
two or three days after childbirth said susan mckay a wyoming 
psychologist who is on the advisory panel yet doctors are treating 
the condition with medications that have to be taken for two weeks 
she said 
why are we subjecting women to this if after a few days it will 
resolve itself anyway she said 
panel members also said evidence showed that only about 10 
percent of women who dont breastfeed have significant pain in 
their breasts from the accumulation of milk but they said even 
these women can be treated without drugs and hormones 
philip a corfman executive secretary of the advisory council 
and fdas supervisory medical officer for fertility and maternal 
health drugs said voluntary compliance by the pharmaceutical 
companies is the first and preferred step 
the fda isnt seeking to ban the drugs and hormones the 
medications have other fdaapproved uses for which medical 
specialists agree they are valuable 
but the agency may meet resistance from the companies although 
some of the companies said they have not been contacted by the fda 
and would not comment on the impending request their leaders defend 
the safety and effectiveness of their products 
sandoz pharmaceuticals corp of east hanover nj which makes 
bromocriptine sold under the name parlodel and the most widely used 
of the medications proposed to the fda revised package inserts to 
inform physicians of alternative therapies and brochures to educate 
women 
we feel it should be a free choice by an informed patient and 
her physician said david l winter a spokesman for sandoz 
about 40 percent of women who give birth dont breastfeed and 
winter said a company study found that 36 percent of these women 
have pain in their breasts after delivery 
bromocriptine has been taken by more than 4 million women during 
the nine years it has been on the market and though it has been 
found to cause minor side effects including nausea and dizziness 
no serious adverse effects have been proven he said 
critics however note that there have been a small number of 
reports of heart attacks strokes and seizures associated with use 
of the drug 
use of estrogen and androgen hormones and their combinations have 
been shown to raise the risk of blood clots corfman said 
but william donaldson a spokesman for merrell dow 
pharmaceuticals inc defended the safety of tace an estrogen 
marketed by the company the company has had four reports of 
bloodclotting problems but none has been reported since 1975 he 
said 
if there are patients who are suffering that cannot be relieved 
in other ways the drug works and it is safe and it is another 
product for physicians to prescribe he said

population pressures threaten to disrupt 
political and social conditions in many nations according to a new 
study that finds japan the worlds most stable nation and mauritania 
the most unstable 
the report from the private population crisis committee released 
sunday put the united states in the moderate category losing 
ground to 16 countries rated as more stable because of this nations 
ethnic conflicts and high rate of youth unemployment 
the analysis by sharon l camp marshall green and patricia g 
barnett noted that rapid population growth especially when 
overlaid with sharp ethnic divisions places enormous strains on 
political institutions 
not surprisingly the two most deeply troubled areas of the 
globe are africa and the middle east with the worlds highest 
growth rates commented green a retired ambassador 
the analysis was compiled by rating a variety of factors and 
totaling the results 
population growth rates movement to urban areas the age 
structure of populations growth of the labor force and presence or 
absence of ethnic and language division in a country were the major 
population factors considered 
the study took into account changes in government over the last 
30 years or so political freedoms civil liberties ethnic or 
religious conflicts and an estimate of the satisfaction or 
frustration of youth in a country 
mauritania situated astride the sahara desert and the dry sahel 
steppe region in west africa led the list for instability with a 95 
score out of a possible 100 it also ranked high in separate 
population pressure rankings scoring 71 out of 100 
rounding out the five most unstable nations were ethiopia 
scoring 87 zaire 83 and burundi and the sudan 81 each 
all five have been through several governments and all but zaire 
scored the maximum in communal violence with bitter conflicts 
underway in several of these countries all five also ranked high in 
the study of population pressures 
on the 100point instability scale japan accumulated only 13 
points and was also near the bottom of the population pressures 
study 
the united states by comparison accumulated 31 points in the 
instability analysis 
both nations managed a top ranking of 1 point for government 
changes political and civil rights 
in the category of ethnic and religious conflicts however while 
japan had one point the united states was given 10 of a possible 20 
and in the dissatisfied youth category unemployment hurt the 
us which scored 18 out of 40 possible points compared with 9 
points for japan 
countries falling between japan and the united states were 
norway 18 switzerland 20 italy denmark and australia 21 each 
sweden and belgium 22 each west germany 23 venezuela 24 costa 
rica 25 jamaica 28 netherlands 29 and greece canada and 
botswana 30 each 
tied with the united states at a rating of 31 were spain and 
france 
the committee which advocates family planning said it is 
clear from trends widely evident in the world that rapid growth of a 
countrys population along with its maldistribution will impose 
great strains on existing political social and economic structures 
and on relations between nations 
of 120 countries studied 101 showed a relationship between 
population pressures and political stability the group concluded 
it said only a handful of governments with rapid population growth 
have maintained stable governments with good records on civil and 
political rights notably botswana jamaica costa rica gambia and 
venezuela 
china where student attempts to promote democracy recently ended 
in military violence scored a 57 rating on the index placing it in 
the high category for instability 
that score may be too low in light of recent events the 
committee said in an addendum issued with the report

in their latest move to toilet train the people 
authorities plan to fine those who fail to flush after using public 
lavatories 
beginning july 1 firsttime offenders may be penalized as much 
as 77 repeat offenders caught neglecting to flush three or more 
times may have to pay as much as 515 
public toilets are defined as those to which the public has 
access including those in hotels department stores cinemas and 
restaurants the environment ministry says many people simply are 
not flushing after use 
government campaigns to improve public hygiene in this citystate 
of 26 million people are not new a clean public toilets campaign 
was first mounted in 1983 a team of health inspectors was deployed 
last year but offenders merely received warning letters 
the deteriorating state of public toilets and antisocial 
bathroom behavior receive much attention in this country which uses 
the slogan clean and green to describe itself 
a survey of 3550 public toilets turned up a problem of users 
showing no consideration for the next person said richard lim of

some questions about the irancontra affair may 
never be answered although new details may come out in the upcoming 
trials of john poindexter and gen richard secord says senate 
majority leader george mitchell 
the senate intelligence committees report on why some white 
house documents on the irancontra affair were not turned over to 
congress does not warrant reopening the overall inquiry mitchell 
said sunday 
there is no basis at this time in my judgment for a 
resumption of the investigation or for the creation of a new 
investigation mitchell said 
obviously there are loose ends he said in an interview on 
nbcs meet the press 
not every single question has been answered and every one may 
not be answered said the majority leader who served on the 
special irancontra investigating committee but there comes a 
question of balance in terms of whether one should or should not 
reopen the investigation 
mitchell said more about reagans role in the funneling of 
proceeds from arms sales to iran to the contras likely will surface 
during the trials of poindexter who succeeded robert mcfarlane as 
national security adviser and secord a former air force general 
the maine democrat had asked the senate panel to examine why 
congressional investigators never saw the six previously undisclosed 
white house memos when copies surfaced during the trial of former 
national security aide oliver north 
the intelligence panel reported friday that the white house 
sometimes handled documents in a chaotic and haphazard manner when 
congress sought them for its irancontra hearings two years ago but 
the committee said there was no evidence of a calculated coverup by 
the reagan administration 
among those documents was a feb 19 1985 memo to former 
president reagan from thennational security adviser robert 
mcfarlane 
the memo recommended that reagan write honduran president roberto 
suazo to reaffirm us support for contra rebels in nicaragua and 
pledge us help in defending honduras if nicaraguan troops crossed 
its border 
located in an informal heads of state file in a box of papers 
at reagans presidential library in california the document 
suggested a quid pro quo arrangement with honduras that has been 
denied by president bush at the time congress had banned direct 
us aid to the contras

house armed services committee members are 
looking for money in the pentagon budget to keep a new helicopter 
and a new fighter and lawmakers say funds intended for the b2 
bomber and star wars are likely targets 
the armed services committee will be working this week on the 
2956 billion pentagon budget and rep albert g bustamante 
dtexas said some of the money has to come out of the system 
he predicted b2 funds will be cut and that sdi strategic 
defense initiative will take a big hit 16 billion to 18 
billion 
several committee members are seeking restoration of money for 
the v22 osprey helicopter and the f14d tomcat fighter jet both 
slated for burial in defense secretary dick cheneys proposed budget 
reps sonny montgomery dmiss and marvin leath dtexas plan 
to introduce an amendment tuesday that would provide an additional 
12 billion for the national guard and reserves the current 69 
billion procurement budget earmarks about 3 percent for reserve 
forces montgomery said 
reps curt weldon rpa and thomas foglietta dpa meanwhile 
have convinced members of the armed services research and 
development subcommittee to save the marine v22 osprey with 351 
million that had been earmarked for the b2 bomber 
in closed session the panel voted 117 to approve the amendment 
according to weldon and foglietta 
the osprey the marine corps revolutionary tiltrotor aircraft 
that takes off like a helicopter but can fly like a plane has 
widespread support in congress especially among former marines and 
members from pennsylvania and texas where the osprey is built by 
boeing helicopter co and bell helicopter textron inc 
opponents of the stealth bomber considered the most expensive in 
history at a cost of between 500 million and 650 million a copy 
sounded off against that program last week 
sen john glenn dohio a member of the senate armed services 
committee appealed to cheney to suspend production because the b2 
has yet to undergo flight testing 
the estimated fiscal 1990 cost for the b2 is 47 billion and 
over a threeyear peak spending period the pricetag is 24 billion 
the department of defense has produced a b2 program that wont 
fly financially said rep les aspin dwis chairman of the 
house armed services panel 
the pentagon has invested about 224 billion in the b2 program 
which is expected to cost about 70 billion to complete cheney 
indicated last week that initial flight tests of the bomber will be 
conducted by the end of the summer 
in addition to focusing on b2 funds members are looking at the 
proposed 49 billion for star wars formally known as the strategic 
defense initiative 
bennett and rep tom ridge rpa joined with 31 republicans and 
democrats earlier in this month in calling for 31 billion for star 
wars in fiscal 1990 rather than the 49 billion proposed by the 
administration 
our amendment will help restore that balance it will mean more 
tanks more planes and more ships while providing for a robust sdi 
program ridge said

the department of housing and urban development 
has reportedly halted or is reviewing payments to nine mortgage 
companies that finance federally backed housing in its coinsurance 
program 
the action is part of an attempt to head off another potential 
scandal for the agency which is the target of congressional 
investigations involving allegations of influencepeddling in hud 
housing contracts the washington post reported today 
coinsurance permits private lenders to earn lucrative fees by 
making mortgage loans to federally backed housing programs but hud 
assumes most of the losses if a project defaults the program is 
designed to encourage the preservation and rehabilitation of 
moderately priced housing 
hud has approved a fourmonth moratorium on new participants for 
the program the post said after a recent review by the hud 
inspector general found mismanagement and alleged fraud in the 
program almost 700 million worth of mortgages are in default it 
said 
three lenders were thrown out of the program in march and six 
others were put on sixmonth probation the post said

the defense minister has told a military tribunal 
that a highly decorated general accused of trafficking in cocaine 
also smuggled ivory and diamonds and should receive a punishment 
that sets an example 
the 47member tribunal was to hold a second closeddoor session 
today to consider the case against gen arnaldo ochoa who is 
alleged to have been involved with colombias medellin drug cartel 
for three years 
the tribunal of topranking officers is to decide if the general 
is to be stripped of his rank and ordered to stand trial on the 
charges 
with his voice at times rising in anger gen raul castro told 
the tribunal on sunday that ochoas actions represent an outrage 
a stab in the back to the fatherland and a slap in the face 
he said ochoa should receive punishment that sets an example 
because he was such a highly regarded officer 
gen castro is the brother of cuban president fidel castro 
ochoa 57 is one of only five officers who hold the medal of the 
hero of the republic of cuba a veteran of the cuban revolution he 
was decorated for his service as a field commander of cuban troops 
in angola 
gen castros allegation about ivory and diamond smuggling 
represented a new dimension in the biggest scandal to rock cuban 
power circles in 30 years of communist rule authorities say ochoa 
was the ringleader of officers who let cocaine smugglers use cuban 
military air bases and arranged escorts for drugcarrying boats 
the defense ministers speech was broadcast on on staterun 
television during the evening newscast which devoded 40 minute to 
the hearing a newscaster said eight witnesses all military 
officers also testified 
gen castro said fellow officers had disapproved as early as 1970 
of ochoas joking manner and frequent bragging about business deals 
they suspected corruption but it was not proven until later he 
said 
only he could explain if he has been able to explain it to 
himself how this process occurred in which his highest aspiration 
becomes transforming himself into a typical capitalist 
businessman gen castro said 
he also accused ochoa of demoralizing officers in angola by 
saying they have sent me to a lost war so that they can hang the 
defeat on me 
the cuban troops were sent to angola to back a marxist government 
in its fight against a rebel insurgency a ceasefire in the 
conflict took effect over the weekend 
ochoa sat with his head bowed and a tense look on his face during 
gen castros speech 
after ochos arrest june 12 cuba reported that 10 other military 
officers and government officials were accused of accepting bribes 
from drug traffickers 
us prosecutors say the names of some of the cuban officers had 
surfaced in a us investigation of a smuggling ring that culminated 
in two indictments and a 1988 trial 
on saturday the cuban military announced that it would shoot 
down private planes that violate cuban airspace and refuse orders to 
land for inspection the announcement said cuba intended to stop 
drugsmuggling planes from using its airspace 
the official granma newspaper has said us allegations about 
cuba being a way station for cocaine traffickers prompted castro to 
order the investigation that led to the arrest of ochoa and the 
other officers 
a foreign ministry official asked about reports that us 
officials want to talk to ochoa did not rule out the possibility 
these things are from top level to top level the ministry 
official said this sort of thing has been done before

max kowalski 72 was found dead saturday in the secondfloor 
apartment of ruben martinez zucarino 36 who was charged with 
seconddegree murder said police spokesman sgt maurice howard 
an arraignment was scheduled for today 
a popular man known as the mayor of brighton beach kowalski 
spent his days in a rented room at the brooklyn boarding house 
tinkering with old televisions and radios and talking with friends 
about his native poland 
this isnt the way god wanted it said philip solsky a 
72yearold neighbor 
he was a friend in a jewish neighborhood who should never have 
died with a swastika or violently 
kowalski a jew whose family perished at auschwitz came to the 
united states in 1949 and worked as a carpenter he survived the 
nazi death camp and his wife also is a holocaust survivor 
she figures that he survived everything else and then for this 
to happen said kowalskis 38yearold son lenny 
the guy might have stabbed him but the war still killed him 
the son said it was the insignia that did it if it hadnt been 
there this never would have happened 
the younger kowalski said he was visiting with his father 
saturday morning in the workshop when he noticed the swastika and a 
skull and crossbones scrawled in blue felttip pen on the door 
his father quietly washed the marks from the door the younger 
kowalski said 
the son complained to the landlady tuey chin who said that when 
she asked zucarino about the graffiti he was holding a marker of the 
same blue color in his hands but he told her he knew nothing about 
the drawings 
a short time later the elder kowalski went to zucarinos 
apartment where he confronted him about the swastika and grabbed 
him by the throat police said 
a fight ensued zucarino stabbed kowalski repeatedly with a 
scissors and a fork and smashed a religious statue over his head

advocates for aids patients hailed a 
proposal by the chief of federal aids research to allow for greater 
distribution of experimental drugs 
dr anthony fauci director of the national institute for allergy 
and infectious diseases recommended the development of parallel 
track testing under which patients would have access to promising 
drugs as soon as they are proved safe even while tests for 
effectiveness were under way 
its a great step forward said dr mathilde krim a founder 
of the american foundation for aids research it represents a new 
consensus on how to handle drug development for aids and 
lifethreatening diseases in general 
martin delaney codirector of project inform a group of aids 
activists said he planned to ask a committee of the national 
academy of science today to endorse faucis idea 
in a speech friday fauci called for the compassionate 
distribution of trial drugs to ineligible applicants 
its clear to me that we cannot just rely on the traditional 
approach of clinical trials fauci said during a talk at the hiv 
treatment awareness week conference hiv stands for human 
immunodeficiency virus which causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
clinical trials are designed to test the effectiveness of drugs 
that have been proved nontoxic test subjects must meet strict 
requirements that typically exclude many applicants 
weve got to rethink the rigidity with which we exclude 
people he said 
fauci said drug companies the federal food and drug 
administration and aids patients must consider the possibility of 
parallel track testing 
its not something that any one person or organization has the 
ability to make happen because youre involving the public and 
private factions he said the critical thing is this cant 
happen by fiat its a concept 
fauci a staunch advocate of clinical trials as the only means to 
discover definitive scientific answers emphasized the continued 
need for rigorous studies 
part of the need for parallel tracking stems from the limited 
availability of drugs to treat aids fauci said similarly the drug 
trial process is slow and limited and leaves out many patients who 
are eager to try experimental drugs

the mother of siamese twins who just celebrated 
their fifth birthday says there is no tragedy in her two girls being 
joined together 
marlene cady wrote in this weeks people magazine that when a 
stranger walks up to verena and ruthie and laments the youngsters 
fate i always tell those people that the only tragedy is in their 
interpretation of the girls situation because obviously ruthie and 
verena are happy kids 
the girls born april 13 1984 are joined from the collarbone to 
the waist and share a heart liver and parts of the intestines 
sharing a heart makes the girls tire easily and they are more 
susceptible to infection than most children 
mrs cady whose family lives near providence ri said that 
when the girls had pneumonia at age 9 months she and her husband 
peter found themselves talking about their lives as now or after 
the girls die 
but when we celebrated their first birthday we realized that 
we could wait for things to change until we were 105 years old but 
then we would have spent the time waiting instead of living mrs 
cady wrote 
she said the children have distinct personalities ruthie is 
stubborn while verena likes to make sure shes doing the right thing 
the girls have mastered feats that doctors thought impossible 
when they perfected riding a special tricycle they rode up and 
down the street for three days knocking on doors and ringing bells 
to make sure everyone knew about their new treasure 
the twins older sister maria had been upset at all the 
attention the twins got but then realized they are special their 
mother said 
sometimes i feel sorry for my sisters being attached because 
they dont always want to do the same thing but when they arent 
arguing i think theyre very lucky to be together maria said 
conjoined twins occur about once in 100000 births about half 
die within 48 hours of birth 
mrs cady said that when she thinks about how long they might 
live its in terms of a couple of years we live for the present

federal inspectors told three seabrook 
nuclear plant officials to shut down the reactor before the 
directive was obeyed according to the nuclear regulatory commission 
but noel dudley senior nrc inspector at the plant denied that 
agency officials had to grab anyone to get a response as alleged by 
a seabrook critic 
rep edward markey dmass said friday nrc chairman lando zech 
and other commission officials told him an nrc inspector grabbed a 
plant operator before thursdays unplanned shutdown 
the boston sunday globe reported details of the shutdown based on 
interviews with dudley plant officials and others the shutdown on 
the 10th day of lowpower tests at the 6 billion plant prompted 
the nrc to suspend further tests pending a review 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon said he will ask an 
nrc appeal board to stop the tests until safety issues for 
fullpower operation are reviewed 
the nrc pointed to those same problems a year ago after a mock 
evacuation exercise shannon said 
plant spokesmen said neither the plant nor the public was 
endangered 
but markey said the results could have been much worse at higher 
power 
its very frightening to think what would have happened if this 
plant had been operating at 70 to 80 percent of full power and there 
had been no nrc people in the control room he said 
thursdays events plant officials say began when a 
malfunctioning valve on the nonnuclear side of the operation 
produced changes in readouts from a part called a pressurizer on the 
nuclear side the change was sufficient to warrant a shutdown 
spokesman ron sher said sunday 
one nrc inspector and then dudley approached three plant 
officials pointing out the problem but got no immediate results 
the globe said minutes later an operator did shut down the plant 
they were making a conscious decision to attempt to regain 
pressure control even though plant procedures called for a 
shutdown dudley said 
an unidentified nrc inspector first approached seabrooks startup 
manager about the pressure reading the globe said 
when the manager did not respond the nrc inspector approached 
the test director who was closer to the scene in the control room 
and the director agreed the plant should be shut the paper said 
but according to the newspaper the test director then talked to 
the shift supervisor a higherranking official who said that 
pressure problem was being corrected on its own and there was no 
need to turn off the plant 
dudley stepped in at that point approaching a still higher 
seabrook official the assistant operators manager said nrc 
spokesman steve horwitz 
the assistant manager consulted the operations manager who 
acknowledged the information and deferred to the decision of the 
shift supervisor to continue to operate horwitz said

oregons congressional delegation and governor 
unanimously agreed on a plan that protects some of the nations 
oldest trees and a rare breed of owl 
logging officials and environmentalists have until tuesday to 
decide whether to back the plan which also permits logging 
oldgrowth forests 
representatives of the timber industry and environmental groups 
brought together by the politicians met during the weekend for the 
first time outside courtrooms in the fiveyear dispute that has 
restricted logging of ancient coastal evergreens 
if the proposal is accepted it would for the first time allow 
legislative protection of the pacific northwests most significant 
stands of oldgrowth forest which range from 200 to 1000 years old 
environmentalists have obtained injunctions on behalf of the rare 
northern spotted owl the injunctions have prevented logging in 
federal lands that are usually open for loggers in washington and 
oregon 
there are fewer than 6000 of the owls which can survive only in 
oldgrowth forest conservationists say continued logging is leading 
to the birds extinction 
the chairman of the weekend meeting sen mark hatfield rore 
called on environmentalists and the industry to respond to the plan 
by noon tuesday he set the deadline because on wednesday the house 
of representatives plans to take up financing for the forest service 
for fiscal year 1990 
environmentalists said they werent sure they could meet the 
deadline 
there are a lot of things undefined said tom giesen 
president of the oregon natural resources council and one of three 
environmental panelists at the summit were discussing it and we 
have a lot of people to talk to 
he added that tuesdays deadline will be very very difficult 
to meet 
john albrecht oregon chairman of the sierra club said the 
proposal would be accepted only with great difficulty 
but he said i would be in favor of it because its a 
shortterm solution i dont see any threat in it 
gov neil goldschmidt and oregons two us senators and five 
congressmen backed the proposal which calls for a shortterm boost 
in the timber supply if environmentalists agree to concessions on 
lawsuits over the northern spotted owl 
the proposal unveiled during saturdays meeting would guarantee 
for the industry 8 billion board feet of timber from national 
forests in oregon and 1 billion board feet from bureau of land 
management forests during the next year and three months 
in return environmentalists would get legislation preserving 
significant old growth stands and a commitment to adopt forest 
planning processes that minimize fragmentation of remaining stands 
no specifics were available on the amount of oldgrowth forest left 
intact 
the agreement would be less than what federal officials had 
allowed before environmentalist won the nocut injunctions 
goldschmidt said he was surprised an agreement was reached among 
the elected officials 
i believe this does provide us with some hope for stability in 
the timber area said rep bob smith rore 
for the first time in a long time we wont have judges and 
lawyers managing oregons resources said rep ron wyden dore 
timber industry representatives were pleased with the movement in 
the issue 
i think what the delegation has done here is unprecedented 
said john hampton a timber company owner representing the industry 
at the summit i personally find the recommendation difficult to 
accept 
but he said thinking of the 90000 people who work in the 
timber industry i have to give it serious consideration 
hatfield said the agreement still meant some jobs would be lost 
under the proposal the wood products industry oregons largest 
industry has estimated that 20000 jobs could be lost in oregon by 
1991 if court injunctions restricting timber supply remained in 
force

potential jurors in the federal trial of 
billionaire leona helmsleys tax evasion case must reveal their 
income what they think about rich people and whether they believe 
the hotel queen is an ogre 
jury selection was to begin today in the trial of the 69yearold 
mrs helmsley and two former aides 
she and her husband harry are accused of evading federal taxes 
by billing personal luxuries including a marble dance floor for 
their mansion as business expenses 
her 80yearold husband has been found incompetent to stand trial 
because of loss of memory 
the helmsleys head a 5 billion real estate and hotel empire 
mostly in the new york city area 
in april 1988 the helmsleys were indicted on charges they evaded 
personal income taxes by disguising about 4 million in renovations 
to their greenwich conn mansion as a business expense 
mrs helmsley is portrayed in advertisements as the queen of 
the helmsley hotels the ad campaign calls manhattans helmsley 
palace the only palace in the world where the queen stands guard 
joseph brodsky lawyer for helmsley aide frank turco planned to 
hand potential jurors a questionnaire asking their incomes and 
attitude toward the wealthy 
he said he wants to know if the potential jurors are biased 
against rich people or whether theyve seen mrs helmsleys ads 
in the newspapers and they think shes an ogre 
turco and joseph v licari are charged with helping create bogus 
invoices to make it appear that the costly renovations on the 8 
million 28room mansion were taxdeductible improvements on 
business properties 
among the renovations listed in the 47count indictment were a 
marble dance floor installed above a swimming pool a breakfast 
room an indooroutdoor stereo system more than 370000 in 
landscaping and an assortment of furniture and paintings 
the indictment said a 45000 silver clock in the shape of the 
helmsley building a gift for harry helmsley was billed to and 
paid by the park lane hotel four jade art objects worth half a 
million dollars were paid for by four hotels as furniture purchases 
the indictment said 
last fall the helmsleys lawyer gerald feffer said the false 
invoices were a device used by turco and licari to enable them to 
steal blindly from the helmsleys thats crucial to our defense 
the case was going to court after a lengthy pretrial period 
during which defense lawyers filed many motions to overturn the 
indictment or to remove one or both of the helmsleys from the case 
the us supreme court in april rejected a motion to dismiss the 
indictment the motion said prosecutors engaged in misconduct 
because of grand jury leaks to the news media 
earlier this month a federal judge found helmsley unable to 
assist in his defense because of memory lapses and reasoning 
difficulties 
the ruling did not dismiss the charges against helmsley but 
indefinitely delayed his trial 
the judge noted that doctors believed helmsleys mental 
deterioration cause by several mild strokes would continue and 
that it was unlikely he would be tried

us and soviet negotiators today opened a new 
round of talks on monitoring underground nuclear tests with both 
sides saying they are close to reaching agreements 
they are drafting new monitoring provisions for two 1970s 
superpower treaties limiting the power of military and other nuclear 
explosions to 150 kilotons 
one kiloton has the force of 1000 tons of tnt and the bomb 
dropped on hiroshima japan in 1945 carried an explosive force of 
20 kilotons 
the aim of the talks is to gain us senate ratification of the 
two accords the original treaties never entered into force because 
the senate refused approval over concerns the limits could not be 
enforced 
talks resumed after a sixmonth recess partly due to the bush 
administrations review of us arms control and security policy 
the new discussions began at the us mission in geneva with a 
meeting of the two delegation chiefs c paul robinson of the united 
states and soviet igor palenykh 
robinson has said the new talks due to last five to six weeks 
will aim to complete agreements 
palenykh said there is a good basis for reaching practical 
results within a short time 
the officials said a verification plan for the 1976 peaceful 
nuclear explosions treaty is virtually complete but some work 
remains on amendments to prevent cheating on the 1974 threshold test 
ban treaty on nuclear weapons tests 
both sides are to be allowed various methods to measure nuclear 
blasts including onsite checks at each others nuclear testing 
grounds 
in the future the negotiations are intended to produce further 
superpower agreements limiting and ultimately banning nuclear 
tests 
the soviet union has long urged washington to join in a mutual 
ban on testing however the united states says tests will be needed 
as long as its military strategy includes reliance on nuclear 
weapons 
the nuclear testing talks are separate from ussoviet 
negotiations on reducing longrange nuclear arsenals that resumed in 
geneva last week

government forces burned homes and 
rounded up villagers in an operation aimed at crushing a 
secessionist revolt that has closed a giant copper mine news 
reports said today 
the rebels were reported overnight to have destroyed a power 
plant at a farm run by bougainville copper ltd which owns the 
economically crucial mine on northern bougainville island 
a state of emergency went into effect today australian 
associated press said it gives authorities broad powers to search 
seize and arrest and it allows them to evacuate people from 
emergency areas 
witnesses reported houses ablaze and said at least two dozen 
people were taken away by police the news agency said soldiers 
blocked the access road to the mine and checked all vehicles it 
said 
many residents were likely to be forcibly evacuated from 
rebelheld areas to isolate secessionist leader francis ona a 
35yearold surveyor and his bougainville republican army the 
agency said 
the unrest which broke out seven months ago closed the mine may 
15 rebel landowners say it is damaging the environment and they 
demand 10 billion in compensation 
the security forces commander col lima dotaona has called on 
ona to surrender he said sunday before launching the operation he 
was confident his men would restore order but he said he expected a 
protracted operation 
its a dangerous operation and you can expect casualties he 
said 
in an address broadcast to the nation friday prime minister 
rabbie namaliu said the government could not allow a criminal 
minority to threaten the unity and economic stability of the 
nation 
the mine had been contributing 20 percent of papua new guineas 
total revenue through royalties and taxes 
the rebels have spurned all attempts at conciliation ambushing 
mine workers and soldiers three soldiers have died and about 20 
other members of the security forces and numerous civilians have 
been wounded 
tensions boiled over because local landowners objected to profits 
being made from the islands mine which ranks among the worlds 10 
biggest opencut copper mines the rebels demand a referendum on 
secession 
australias biggest mining company cra ltd jointly operates 
the mine which is about 300 miles northeast of the mainland

authorities proclaimed today that all of china 
backed the ouster of top communist party moderates and suggested 
the purge of party members who sympathized with the prodemocracy 
movement could expand 
the tightly controlled media stepped up a propaganda blitz 
encouraging support for the ruling communists decision to relieve 
party head zhao ziyang of all his party posts for supporting the 
turmoils and splitting the party 
a senior military official today reiterated previous government 
claims that there was no bloodshed on tiananmen square when 
tanks and troops cleared it of prodemocracy demonstrators on june 
34 
the whole process was nonviolent no one used guns said li 
zhiyun one of the commanders of the assault during a tour of the 
square to foreign reporters 
li acknowledged some innocent people may have been wounded as 
troops battled to reach the square but said people had been warned 
not to go out on the streets that nightli said he had no 
regrets about the street battles to reach the square 
the government said nearly 300 people died in the street battles 
in beijing about half of them soldiers chinese witnesses and 
western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as 
high as 3000 
the leadership shakeup announced saturday replaced the 
69yearold zhao with shanghai party secretary jiang zemin 62 a 
proponent of economic reforms who supports the current hard line 
that dissent must be dealt with harshly 
zhao is believed to have been stripped of power last month for 
refusing to endorse plans by premier li peng and senior leader deng 
xiaoping to declare martial law in beijing and have the army clear 
central tiananmen square 
the partys central committee on saturday also announced the 
dismissal from the standing committee of the ruling politburo of hu 
qili another moderate said to have opposed the military crackdown 
and several zhao supporters in top party positions 
there were also suggestions the purge would be extended to lower 
levels of the party and government 
the partys central commission for discipline inspection in a 
report appearing in chinese dailies today said party members who 
deviated from the correct political stand and violated partys 
disciplines during the turmoils and the counterrevolutionary 
rebellion should be strictly punished including expelling them 
from the party 
it added that those party organizations which had made 
resistance against the decisions made by the partys central 
committee or had been controlled or manipulated by bad people during 
the turmoils and counterrevolutionary rebellion should be firmly 
overhauled and strictly dealt with 
turmoils alludes to the seven weeks of studentled 
prodemocracy demonstrations that were joined by hundreds of 
thousands of people including journalists workers professionals 
party members and government workers 
counterrevolutionary rebellion is the governments term for 
popular resistance to the introduction of troops in beijing and for 
the nationwide unrest that followed the military assault on the 
capital 
the official media which in the first weeks following the 
assault reported about 1800 arrests nationwide and paraded 
handcuffed detainees before television screens every night has 
recently stopped publicizing detentions 
it was not clear whether the government was responding to the 
international statements of protest and outrage over the harsh 
suppression of dissent which has included the execution of 27 
people 
chinese sources said students teachers and others who joined the 
prodemocracy demonstrations were still being picked up by police 
although some were being released after questioning 
national television and radio and the official press were filled 
with statements from party officials soldiers intellectuals 
farmers and workers all solidly backing the partys hardline 
stance toward those who failed to stand up against the partys 
enemies 
the carefully orchestrated propaganda campaign showed a people 
dramatically changed from a month ago when both blue and 
whitecollar workers showed strong support for the students and 
their demands that the party allow greater freedom and end 
corruption

intellectuals on another wanted list issued by chinese authorities

yan jiaqi is reported to be in france after fleeing to hong kong 
last week wan runnan also came through hong kong and eventually 
will travel to the united states the diplomatic source said 
yan was a leader of the beijing independent intellectuals 
association which played an important role in the movement for 
freedom and was banned by the chinese government when martial law 
was declared may 20 
wan general manager of chinas first private hightechnology 
company the stone corp had called for a meeting of the national 
congress to discuss the demands put forth by students who were 
demonstrating for a freer and less corrupt society 
during the student movement stone and the students kept close 
relations the independent ming pao newspaper in hong kong 
reported

through the underground railroad operated by students and other 
activists in this territory on the southeastern coast of china

hong kong and refused to give details about how they were smuggled 
out of the country 
since june 34 when the chinese army moved into beijing to crush 
the protest movement china has arrested at least 1800 people and 
27 people have been executed 
many student leaders and dissidents fled underground to avoid 
detention 
the asia television network in hong kong on sunday broadcast what 
it said was a statement made by yan jiaqi in which he leveled a 
withering attack at chinas senior leader deng xiaoping premier li 
peng and president yang shangkun who were behind the crackdown 
chinas political situation today is in the midst of a white 
terror according to a copy of the statement made available by the 
network he accused the three leaders of using the inhuman 
policies of fascism to take all of those who support democracy the 
real chinese people and wipe out the whole lot

its an unwritten law of american business you 
cant sell computer software on the honor system and expect to be a 
success 
unless youre bob wallace president owner and exchief 
programmer of seattlebased quicksoft publisher of pcwrite the 
acclaimed shareware wordprocessor for personal computers then 
you break the unwritten law 
i encourage people to copy the software and then encourage them 
to pay for it after using it its like public television the 
40yearold wallace said last week 
users who pay and register get extra benefits the printed 
manual telephone support quicksofts newsletter and updates of the 
program 
but then there are intangible benefits youre doing the right 
thing youre helping us out keeping us in business he said and 
that leads to newer and better versions of pcwrite 
i dont worry about the people who dont register i worry 
about the people who do register he said i want to make sure 
theyre happy 
if theyre happy and were making a reasonable profit thats 
good 
its good enough for quicksoft with about 30 employees to 
expand its product base too on tuesday the company announced its 
new filesearch and hypertext informationlinking utility 
scheduled for latesummer shipping 
quicksoft also has published its first catalog of thirdparty 
software it selects and supports for use with pcwrite 
wallace whose catchphrase is making a living not a 
killing chose his profession at age 11 i read a readers 
digest article the man who talked to machines he said i was 
one of the people that just knew then i would be a programmer 
he found computers to work on with an explorer scout troop 
sponsored by control data corp in bethesda md then at the 
university of maryland brown university and the university of 
washington 
i got kind of discouraged because computers were so expensive 
i couldnt own one and i really wanted to own one so i kind of got 
distracted and went off i was living on an island in puget sound 
for a while he said 
the first personal computers appeared about the time he founded 
the northwest computer club in 1976 he went to work for the retail 
computer store in seattle 
in 1978 he was the 10th employee hired by microsoft corp the 
software company that created the ibmstandard personal computer 
operating systems 
sometime in 82 i found myself thinking gee microsoft is 
getting huge and im kind of getting lost here he said 
microsoft had 300 employees then it now has about 3800 worldwide 
he started writing a program for word processing 
i thought i could do something people would really like and 
really felt right but i didnt know if i could explain that i 
couldnt really run an ad saying buy my word processor it feels 
good 
he could however share his word processor using the electronic 
bulletin boards of computer hobbyists that eliminated distribution 
and advertising expenses 
the first version 10 was introduced in august 1983 with 150 
copies sent to the press and 150 to bulletin boards a pc magazine 
reviewer suggested changes wallace made them by february 1984 
wallace had written version 13 and the reviewer liked it 
that review pretty much started us out it generated enough 
interest and revenue so that i could hire our first employee uh 
who i later married 
megan dana wallace an artist draws quicksofts trademark 
office cat on the companys literature 
pcwrite typically is rated as good as or better than other 
fullfeatured word processors costing five times more than its 89 
registration fee 
its anybodys guess how many copies of pcwrite are out there 
wallace says the best estimates come from magazine surveys which 
typically estimate that 6 percent of their readers use pcwrite 
i discount that down to maybe 4 percent and thats somewhere 
between half a million and 1 million users and thats real 
exciting he said 
working from the other end we know we have paid users of about 
125000 of which 45000 are full registered users and the other 
80000 are on group licenses corporations and universities he 
said 
he expects revenues this year to be between 2 million and 3 
million sales declined to 17 million last year from 2 million in 
1987 he blames the slump on himself for putting off the decision 
to step down as chief programmer to take up exclusively the 
presidency of quicksoft 
a final thought from bob wallace 
our business is based on people being honest and people are 
thats why were successful

the interior department is coming under fire 
for assigning specific dollar values to birds mammals and other 
animals killed in toxic spills as a means of toting up the damage to 
the environment 
the department plans to use the same basic approach in setting 
the damage estimate for the disastrous oil spill that occurred march 
24 spill when the tanker exxon valdez ran aground in alaskas prince 
william sound the washington post reported today 
no dollar values have yet been set in that incident but the post 
said that in past spills the department has calculated that fur 
seals were worth 15 each sea gulls 788 apiece and canada geese 
3574 each striped bass were valued at 184 per pound 
but environmentalists argue that the rules dont account for the 
longterm damage to the environment the newspaper said 
if things continue as planned the accounting of the 
environmental damage caused by the exxon valdez tragedy would be a 
small measure of what actually occurred said rep robert g 
torricelli dnj a jury can better assess the enormity of that 
damage than by attempting to use an adding machine and a pile of 
reimbursement receipts 
the figures were developed from a computer model which is 
supposed to reflect the market value of the wildlife the post 
reported similar computer models are to be used to determine a 
market value for the wildlife killed in three weekend oil spills in 
the waters off the continental united states 
the bill for the valdez spill will eventually be sent to exxon 
owner of the tanker that spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil 
thus far the oil has washed up on 728 miles of beaches and the 
dead wildlife count stands at 25700 migratory birds 800 sea 
otters 84 bald eagles and 20 harbor seals the post said

police have arrested four thai fishermen 
who admit to massacring 130 vietnamese refugees with pistols knives 
and hammers a senior officer said today 
a lone survivor of the attack a young man returned from a 
refugee camp in malaysia to identify the four said lt col prakob 
banjapong deputy police superintendant in the southern coastal town 
of songkhla 
charges against the four include murder robbery attempted 
murder and attempted rape in the april 16 attack they face the 
death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted 
in a telephone interview prakob said police on thursday arrested 
two fishermen aged 40 and 20 from one of the two boats involved in 
the south china sea slayings police found nails on the boat in the 
area of the boats name indicating the fishermen had tried to cover 
up the name he said 
those two suspects led police to two other men aged 29 and 22 
who were arrested saturday prakob said nails also were found 
driven into their boat 
he said the four admit they killed the vietnamese with pistols 
knives and hammers 
refugee relief officials said the pirates intercepted the 
vietnamese vessel off the malaysian coast 
they looted the boat locked up the refugees below and set the 
vessel on fire the officials said 
some refugees managed to jump out but were shot by the pirates 
the 22yearold man who survived was rescued by another vietnamese 
boat they said 
pirate attacks against vietnamese boat people have become 
increasingly violent 
according to the un high commissioner for refugees pirates 
attacked 38 boats since april 30 they killed 11 vietnamese and left 
372 others missing raped 116 and abducted 70 
prakob said thai police this year have arrested four other 
suspected pirates who await trial for robbery and rape 
the threat of pirates prisonlike refugee camps and days at sea 
without food and water have not discouraged the exodus of 
vietnamese more than 15 million have fled their homeland since 
1975 
nations overwhelmed by an unrelenting flow that has increased by 
up to 300 percent this year have become less hospitable they say 
the boat people now are fleeing economic hardship not political 
persecution and are calling for forced repatriation 
but at an international conference in geneva earlier this month 
vietnam repeated that it will not accept those forced to return 
the meeting ended inconclusively with a plan to screen new 
arrivals and encourage voluntary returns if that did not work 
alternatives would have to be examined delegates said

reformers promoted on saturday to a newly created fourman presidium 
of the party 
the central committee named economic reformer redzoe nyers party 
chairman it said he pozgary and premier miklos nemeth will run the 
party along with karoly grosz the partys general secretary 
the creation of the presidium seriously undercuts the power of 
grosz a centrist who has come under heavy criticism by reformers 
the presidium is to lead the party on a provisional basis until a 
crucial party congress set for oct 7 when communists will choose 
who will lead the party as hungary prepares for its first free and 
competitive elections next year 
the choice of a leader at the congress is considered crucial to 
the partys attempts to hold power when the elections are held 
the reformers believe that only their more democratic policies 
can give the party hope of emerging as the strongest force in next 
years elections 
pozsgay said the central committee nominated him for the new top 
state post pending approval of parliament the daily magyar hirlap 
reported 
the newspaper printed a transcript of an hourlong television talk 
show with the four presidium members on state television sunday 
night 
i have been greatly honored at the session when they agreed 
that when the office of president of the republic is created by 
parliament ill be the nominee pozsgay said 
pozsgay previously had been named a likely candidate to replace 
the current largely ceremonial post of president of the 
presidential council held by bruno f straub 
parliament is scheduled to go into session on tuesday but its 
agenda was not made public it was not known whether the issue would 
be discussed 
knowledgeable sources said the new office will be created in 
1990 when legislative elections are due to be held 
under constitutional changes being considered the office of 
state president would be vested with much greater powers than the 
present figurehead role

the states decision to consider 
reopening the investigation into the 1964 slayings of three civil 
rights workers has raised hopes a cloud of collective guilt may be 
lifted from this small community 
what philadelphias 8000 residents need now says the editor of 
a newspaper here is a cathartic event such as a new trial to help 
them deal with the emotional fallout from the towns complicity in 
the attempted coverup of the june 21 1964 slayings of james 
chaney andrew goodman and michael schwerner 
the people here didnt step forward and speak out against the 
murders 25 years ago thats why we need to do it now said 
stanley dearman editor and publisher of the neshoba county democrat 
last week attorney general mike moore said he was considering 
reopening the investigation into the killings which were dramatized 
in the movie mississippi burning moore said he would examine 
the files before making a final decision 
nine mississippians including a deputy sheriff eventually went 
to prison on federal charges for violating the victims civil rights 
however the state never prosecuted the case in which chaney 
goodman and schwerner were arrested in neshoba county on a traffic 
charge and then turned over to a ku klux klan lynch mob that shot 
them and buried the bodies in an dam near philadelphia 
on wednesday during a memorial observance mississippi secretary 
of state dick molpus issued a public apology to the victims 
families 
we deeply regret what happened here 25 years ago he said 
every decent person in philadelphia and neshoba county and 
mississippi feels that way 
wednesdays ceremony also attended by gov ray mabus marked the 
first time state officials had honored the victims schwerner and 
goodman white civil rights volunteers from new york and chaney a 
black civil rights worker from nearby meridian were killed while 
working on a voter registration drive 
dearman editor of the weekly paper since 1966 said the 
observance and movie had helped weaken some of the barriers holding 
back the emotions of residents including his own feelings 
theres a lot of denial in philadelphia people saying they 
werent involved or responsible for what happened he said i 
used to feel that same way but ive come to believe in the concept 
of collective guilt and ive come to the conclusion that everybody 
in a community has a responsiblity to stand up when they see 
something wrong happen 
he added that an investigation and trial could provide the final 
step in the communitys acceptance of its responsibility 
a trial undoubtedly would dredge up a lot of pain and 
turmoil he said but while there have been many positive 
changes here i dont think were ever going to be able to 
completely put the past behind us until weve dealt with the 
murders 
molpus a philadelphia native said he too would support 
reopening the investigation if moore decides to go ahead 
the attorney general took an oath to uphold the law as i 
did said molpus whose mother still lives in philadelphia but 
i admit to having mixed emotions it could tear up the community and 
turn us back toward a dark and diverse time in our history 
charles mcclain mayor of philadelphia said he feared reopening 
the case would divide the community 
however ben chaney whose brother was slain says he thinks it 
should be reopened 
it would help bring attention to some of the things that never 
were dealt with 25 years ago such as the klan beatings at the mount 
zion methodist church near philadelphia he said 
jr bud cole was severely beaten by hooded and robed 
klansmen following a meeting at the church which was burned the 
week before chaney goodman and schwerner were killed 
there also was no investigation into the burning of the church 
which was later rebuilt and was part of last weeks memorial 
observance 
thats the way things were back then cole said a white 
man could do anything to a negro and never be held accountable 
but dearman says much has changed in philadelphia which now has 
an integrated police force and fire department 
and a recent kkk rally in philadelphia drew little support he 
said 
only about a hundred people showed up and most of them were 
there as observers dearman said in fact something happened 
ive never seen before white people were actually shouting at the 
klan to go away and leave us alone

villagers at a church in a remote village and killed at least 39 
people including women and children officials said today

beheaded during the incident which occurred sunday at a united 
church of christ chapel in rano on mindanao island about 640 miles 
southeast of manila 
at least eight people were wounded officials said the military 
said the death toll could be higher because the rebels carted away 
their casualties a survivor claimed two rebels were killed 
a church official in manila said the 39 confirmed dead were 
congregation members 
lt col jose maneja deputy commander of davao del sur province 
said about 100 new peoples army guerrillas entered the village 
looking for the leader of a group of local anticommunist vigilantes 
maneja said details were unclear but apparently someone 
indicated that vigilante leader ruben ayap was inside the church and 
shooting broke out ayap was killed along with his two brothers 
abadi and clemente 
abadi ayap head of the laymens group at the church and his 
brother clemente were beheaded the military said 
regina dominguez 41 whose daughter was killed in the shooting 
said the rebels were angry because villagers had formed an 
anticommunist group 
they took revenge mrs dominguez said by telephone from 
nearby digos they just fired 
mrs dominguez said she was not in the village when the shooting 
began but heard from survivors that villagers hacked to death at 
least one guerrilla with long bolo knives 
lt col cresencio maralit spokesman for the philippine 
constabulary in manila said the villagers had made the rebels angry 
by refusing to pay revolutionary taxes 
arnold endar 22 a vigilante who survived the attack told 
reporters he and about 70 others were crowded into the bamboowalled 
church when the rebels opened fire with m16 rifles and two machine 
guns 
he said vigilante members ran from the church to get their 
weapons and killed at least two guerrillas 
i was hit when i ran out of the church to get my bolo said 
endar who was wounded in the leg i saw many people dead and i 
pretended to be dead as i ran from the church i stepped on many 
bodies 
endar said he rode by horseback for two hours to alert a military 
garrison he said 20 members of his vigilants group and 12 children 
were among the dead including a oneyearold 
in manila samuel briones human rights coordinator for the 
united church of christ said the battle broke out after sunday 
school as the congregation was preparing for services 
he said it was unusual for rebels to attack his denominations 
churches 
the united church of christ has been widely criticized by the 
military for alleged links with communist rebels because of the 
denominations outspoken stand on human rights 
sundays incident occurred in an area of southeastern mindanao 
where the military has organized armed anticommunist vigilante 
groups to counter rebels in remote areas 
various church organizations have accused the vigilantes of 
widespread human rights abuses 
the new peoples army has been waging a 20year insurgency to 
establish a communist state in the philippines

prime minister sousuke uno promised political 
reforms to win back public trust today after his beleaguered party 
was badly beaten in an election seen as a barometer of voter 
sentiment 
on sunday socialist party candidate kinuko ofuchi won a 
byelection in northern japan for a seat in parliaments upper 
house defeating a candidate from the governing liberal democratic 
party 
a socialist previously held the seat but uno told reporters 
today i never expected that we would lose so badly in the 
traditionally conservative district of niigata 
uno acknowledged a new 3 percent sales tax a huge stock scandal 
and farm issues contributed to his liberal democratic partys defeat 
but he again refused to comment on the governing partys latest 
scandal allegations that he paid a geisha to be his mistress for 
four months in 1985 
i have respected political ethics for 30 years and i have not 
done anything unethical he told a news conference 
but he added i think it is regrettable that i caused trouble 
a weekly magazine had reported the geisha link without naming 
the woman 
after the polls closed sunday night a 40yearold woman appeared 
in a national television interview saying she was the former geisha 
and that uno had paid more than 21430 to her and her geisha house 
mitsuko nakanishis allegations have sullied the reputation that 
led to unos selection as prime minister just a month ago his 
predecessor noboru takeshita resigned to take responsibility for a 
scandal in which the giant information and publishing conglomerate 
recruit co is accused of trying to influence government policy 
with excessive donations and sales of bargainpriced unlisted stock 
to public officials 
support for unos new cabinet was at only 167 percent in a 
telephone survey of 10000 people conducted june 1619 the nihon 
keizai shimbun japans leading financial newspaper reported today 
although this was an improvement from the 131 percent rating for 
takeshitas cabinet in march 528 percent of those questioned in 
the latest poll said they do not support unos government nikkei 
said the remaining 305 percent did not respond 
both polls and byelections are being watched closely ahead of 
next months elections for parliaments upper house where unos 
party holds 143 of 251 seats 
ms ofuchi sundays election winner campaigned against the 
sales tax that took effect april 1 along with income tax cuts 
criticized unos party fpr the scandal and apparently won favor 
with rural voters displeased with a greater opening of japans farm 
market to imports 
with 996 percent of the vote counted ms ofuchi had 559603 
votes to 482245 votes for hideo kimi of unos party and 47064 for 
kazuo murata of the japan communist party 
we intend to listen attentively to the peoples voices uno 
said today 
he said his party will work to restore public confidence by 
promoting political reforms 
i understand that following the watergate scandal the united 
states made various political reforms including election reform and 
other tougher regulations to prevent recurrences of the same 
wrongdoings uno said

flying anywhere

five days touring moscow among stops will be red square where west 
german teenager mathias rust gained worldwide fame by landing a 
singleengine cessna in may 1987 after evading soviet air defenses

american children that he hopes to present to president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
however it is not certain the soviet leader will have time to 
meet the boy before he takes off friday on a hopscotch journey

revelers dressed as sea monsters and 
playing kazoos held the second annual festival in honor of the 
humming toadfish the underwater lovers who torment residents each 
summer with their rhapsodizing 
we figured if we cant beat em join em said newly crowned 
toadfish king phil frank a cartoonist whose coronation was 
accompanied by kazoo music the sound residents say is most like the 
love sputters of the toadfish 
frank then led the dancing leaping revelers along the dock 
sunday as they played yes we have no bananas and the battle 
hymn of the republic 
the festival started a year ago after sleepless residents 
demanded to know the source of the noise that plagues the bayside 
town north of san francisco for three months each summer 
the cry of the bulgingeyed bubblelipped creatures a noise 
some likened to the sound of b52 bombers usually starts after dusk 
and lasts for hours sometimes until 2 or 3 am 
residents at first advanced a number of theories which frank a 
17year resident of the town lampooned in his comic strip 
farley which appears in a san francisco newspaper 
some held the cia was pumping nerve gas into the san francisco 
bay others claimed a japanese ship loaded with electric massagers 
sank in the bays waters and lost its cargo which buzzed on 
a phone call to john mccosker director of the steinhart 
aquarium led to the discovery that the noise was not manmade it 
seems that every summer sometime in june the humming toadfish 
migrate to sausalitos richardson bay and emit the noise during 
their two to threemonth mating season the sound particularly 
reverberates through the cement foundations of houseboats 
with the mystery solved some residents have come to welcome the 
toadfish and the excuse they bring to drink beer eat hot dogs and 
jigs in the street 
its just a goof said resident joe troise the toadfish is 
the perfect thing for sausalito its eccentric its peculiar its 
off the wall

in an apparent us policy shift 
assistant secretary of state lawrence eagleburger said in an 
interview broadcast today that syria should withdraw from lebanon 
also today police said a bomb went off in a school in the 
syrianpoliced mountain town of dhour shweir wounding the 
principal a teacher and seven schoolchildren they had no other 
immediate details 
the syrians have to back off eagleburger said on 
christiancontrolled voice of lebanon in an interview conducted by 
the stations washington correspondent 
all of the outside parties ought to back off and let the 
lebanese make their own judgment about where their future lies 
there is too much foreign involvement on all sides 
his remarks in the taped interview reversed a statement he made 
before the senate foreign affairs committee on march 16 he said at 
that time that the withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon would 
aggravate the situation because their presence restrains the warring 
parties 
the syrians have 40000 troops deployed in mainly moslem areas in 
lebanon under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate 
along with druse militia allies the syrians have been engaged in 
bloody fighting with army commander gen michel aouns 20000 mainly 
christian troops since march 8 
todays interview was broadcast during renewed syrian shelling of 
the christian coastline north of beirut the syrians are maintaining 
a blockade of the enclave to block military supplies sent by iraq 
syrias main arab foe 
a police spokesman who cannot be identified under standing 
rules said sporadic 130mm mortar fire hit around the ports of 
jounieh and byblos 
aouns artillery retaliated with 155mm howitzer fire on a seaside 
boulevard of moslem west beirut where several syrian batteries are 
deployed 
no casualties were reported today by police count 373 people 
have been killed and 1460 wounded in the 14 weeks of bloodshed 
eagleburgers interview was broadcast a day after secretary of 
state james a baker iii urged lebanese leaders to show restraint to 
avert further bloodshed 
baker made his appeal in identical letters to acting prime 
minister salim hoss and aoun who head the rival moslem and 
christian cabinets in lebanons divided government 
aides to both leaders said bakers letter restated us support 
for arab league efforts to end lebanons 14year civil war 
in todays interview eagleburger also said the united states was 
optimistic about efforts by the threemember arab committee on 
lebanon 
it is made up of king hassan ii of morocco king fahd of saudi 
arabia and algerian president chadli bendjedid the panel was set up 
during an arab summit in morocco last month 
were obviously very hopeful that the arab committee can in 
fact bring sense to the situation and can convince the syrians to 
withdraw plus all those other foreign parties that have gotten 
themselves involved in the tragedy of lebanon said eagleburger 
the arab panel was given a sixmonth mandate to enforce a 
ceasefire lift land and sea blockades stemming from the battles 
and introduce political reforms to redistribute power between 
moslems and christians 
the arab committee is scheduled to meet in the algerian town of 
oran tuesday to discuss its efforts 
the respected annahar newspaper quoted unidentified political 
and official sources today as saying syria was bent on overthrowing 
aoun by military economic or political means 
but the independent daily said the military option was out 
because syria has been notified that it was impermissible to 
invade christian east beirut it did not say who served the 
notification 
the paper said the syrians resorted to blockades of the christain 
enclave hoping to incite christians against aoun 
but that has not worked and the syrians have only the 
political option left to get rid of aoun the newspaper said 
aoun mounted the initial attacks in march and declared he wanted 
to drive syria out of lebanon

despite falling mortgage rates sales of 
existing homes dropped 56 percent in may to their lowest level in 
16 months the national association of realtors reported today 
the real estate trade group said existing singlefamily homes 
were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 321 million units 
last month the previous low was 32 million units in january 1988 
the drop in may followed sales of 34 million units in both march 
and april down 2 percent from february the may resale rate was off 
113 percent from the rate a year earlier 
the weakness in sales this year has been blamed on rising home 
mortgage rates reflecting efforts by the federal reserve to fight 
inflationary pressures by tightening the supply of credit 
the fed has been easing its grip on credit recently fixedrate 
mortgages have fallen from a high of 1122 percent in march to 1048 
percent at the end of may according the federal home loan mortgage 
corp 
the psychological impact of last months rate drops didnt hit 
the market until the end of may said realtors president ira 
gribin in a month when activity usually picks up sales still 
were slipping across the nation he said 
buyers are not going to start flooding the markets the instant 
mortgage rates start to go down it take time for the tide to 
change gribin said predicting that june sales will be heavier as 
more people take advantage of lower rates 
the median price for existing homes in may was 93100 up 200 
from april and 39 percent above that for may 1988 the realtors 
said the median is the point at which half of the homes sold for 
more and half for less 
the sales decline in may was led by 101 percent drop in the 
midwest where sales fell to 800000 units 
the west where sales had been strong posted a resale pace 
decline of 81 percent below april to 570000 units sales of 
590000 units in the northeast were 33 percent below april

that means the court would have to hand down a decision in the 
abortion case webster vs reproductive health services on 
thursday the final day of the term or schedule new arguments at 
the outset of the next term which begins the first monday in 
october 
never it seems have so many awaited a decision so anxiously or 
made such a public display of their anxiety 
the potential stakes are enormous the court is being asked to 
use the webster case to reverse or substantially limit its 1973 
decision that women have a constitutional right to abortion 
such a ruling could allow states to outlaw abortion or otherwise 
curtail legal abortions which number 15 million each year 
with time running out on the courts 198889 term partisan 
lawyers gather in the hushed courtroom each day before the 10 am 
starting time to catch the first word interest groups make known 
their availability to supply instant reactions scores of reporters 
jam the courtroom press row and the courts public information 
office a floor below satellite transmission trucks are parked 
nearby 
each day the word passes quickly no webster today 
meanwhile rumors abound and crash to earth 
at least one such erroneous rumor got into print after arkansas 
attorney general steve clark went public with the scuttlebutt 
out of washington that the decision would be announced june 19 
weve never been through anything quite like this says court 
spokeswoman toni house hectic she offers as a oneword summary 
the most senior reporter covering the court lyle denniston of 
the baltimore sun says the anticipation is rivaled only by that 
experienced before the 1976 decisions reinstating capital punishment 
and the 1978 ruling in which the court first condoned the concept of 
affirmative action 
here you have the court contemplating taking away a 
constitutional right it created itself the fact that is a real 
prospect now has captured everyones attention he said 
on the day the abortion ruling is announced the national 
abortion rights action league will conduct an 1130 am news 
conference to give its appraisal of the webster decision 
planned parenthood will host a similar affair at noon the 
congress prolife leadership and national right to life committee at 
130 the american life league at 2 the list goes on 
a special edition of washington week in review is planned for 
public television 
many such organizations for weeks have sent representatives to 
the court to harvest each days decision crop a recent days 
singlefile line stretched past 100

the abortion dispute officially has become the most closely 
watched case of the 1980s a record number 78 of 
friendofthecourt briefs was filed by individuals and 
organizations not part of the missouri litigation 
in a less formal and likely less effective form of lobbying

a legislator today suggested the nation withdraw 
its highest military order from former soviet leader leonid 
brezhnev who was given the honor 33 years after the end of world 
war ii tass news agency reported 
brezhnev who rose to major general serving as a political 
officer in the war was given the jewelencrusted order of victory 
in 1978 the official agency said he died in 1982 
supreme soviet deputy albert likhachev said many people see the 
decoration as one of brezhnevs undeserved rewards tass noted 
however that the legislature has no power to revoke the award 
such a move would further discredit brezhnev who now is 
condemned widely for plunging the economy into a crisis and 
stagnating the rest of soviet society his name has been stripped 
off cities and ships and his relatives have lost some benefits 
given to family members of a soviet leader 
the supreme soviet the nations first fulltime lawmaking body 
convened today to confirm cabinet members and organize writing bills 
and ratifying treaties tass said 
these are new powers for the legislature a division of the 
larger congress of peoples deputies that began work may 25 in 
closed hearings last week legislative committees rejected at least 
four of more than 60 nominees to ministerial and other senior posts 
the fight now moves to the full 542member body 
one chamber the council of nationalities decided today that 
committees in both houses should consider bills before publication 
in the press tass reported 
several deputies objected to the large number of military and 
defense industry representatives on a committee to oversee defense 
and the dreaded kgb secret police but they were told experts were 
assigned deliberately to committees in their area of professional 
expertise tass said 
izvestia the government daily reported today that the 
committees hearings will be behind closed doors despite calls for 
more openness in those areas 
the chamber approved the composition of its committees after 
changes tass said without elaborating 
the legislature also is to consider bills on raising pensions and 
the rights of deputies and to set priorities for tackling the 
nations economic and social problems tass said 
the soviet of nationalities elected ukrainian poet boris oleinik 
a reformer from kiev as one of its deputy chairmen and the soviet 
of unions elected moldavian alexander mokanu to a similar job 
mondays separate sessions of the two chambers originally to be 
televised nationally did not appear on the air or in the broadcast 
schedule a spokeswoman at the state gostelradio said officials 
decided there was no need to televise the session

the supreme court declining to curtail 
enormous awards in personalinjury lawsuits ruled today that the 
constitutions ban on excessive fines places no limit on how much 
money may be won in such cases 
by a 72 vote the justices refused to extend the prohibition 
against excessive fines to civil as well as criminal cases 
but the justices left open the possibility that the 
constitutions dueprocess requirements could put a lid on punitive 
damage awards that issue was not raised properly in the case 
decided today 
the court upheld a 6 million award a jury ordered a houston 
wastecollection company to pay a vermont competitor 
justice harry a blackmun wrote for the court that the 
constitutions eighth amendment which bans cruel and unusual 
punishment and excessive fines always has been interpreted to 
restrain governmental power in punishing criminals 
awards of punitive damages do not implicate these concerns 
he said we therefore hold on the basis of the history and 
purpose of the eighth amendment that its excessivefines clause 
does not apply to awards of punitive damages in cases between 
private parties 
but blackmun hinted that the court might view the constitutions 
dueprocess protections more liberally 
there is some authority in our opinions for the view that the 
due process clause places outer limits on the size of a civil 
damages award he said 
we have never addressed the precise question whether due 
process acts as a check on undue jury discretion to award punitive 
damages in the absence of any express statutory limit blackmun 
continued that inquiry must await another day 
blackmun was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices william j brennan byron r white thurgood marshall 
antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
brennan and marshall in a separate concurring opinion 
practically invited a future challenge to large punitive damages 
based on the due process issue 
i join the courts opinion on the understanding that it leaves 
the door open for a holding that the due process clause constrains 
the imposition of punitive damages in civil cases brennan said in 
an opinion for himself and marshall 
justices sandra day oconnor and john paul stevens dissented 
they said punitive damages may violate the constitutions ban on 
excessive fines 
todays case produced intense interest in the business community 
and among lawyers and consumer groups who have been battling for 
years over the legitimacy of multimilliondollar awards in a range 
of lawsuits 
business leaders and others argue that skyrocketing damage 
judgments are catastrophic for american competitiveness and 
development of new products particularly new forms of medical 
treatment 
consumer activists and trial lawyers say punitive damages are a 
powerful deterrent to corporate greed that poses a threat to public 
safety 
some state legislatures reacting to soaring insurance rates in 
recent years have imposed ceilings on how much money can be 
recovered in personalinjury cases 
in todays case the court was not asked nor did it rule on the 
constitutionality of such state tort reform laws 
todays ruling will influence juries and judges not legislators 
as they weigh penalties in lawsuits 
the case involved a 6 million punitive damage award against 
browningferris industries inc a wastecollection with 
headquarters in houston the company was ordered to pay the money to 
kelco disposal inc of burlington vt 
browningferris with annual revenues exceeding 13 billion 
decided in 1973 to enter the waste disposal business in vermont 
the company appointed joseph kelley to be district manager for 
its new regional office in burlington 
kelley left browningferris in 1980 to form his own company 
kelco disposal inc which soon became a direct competitor 
kelco captured more than 40 percent of the market in the 
burlington region by 1982 
there was testimony in the case that browningferris then 
instructed its new burlington manager to put kelley out of 
business do whatever it takes squish him like a bug 
browningferris then cut its prices almost in half a maneuver 
that prompted kelley to file an antitrust suit charging the larger 
company with trying to monopolize the wastecollection market in the 
region browningferris sold its vermont business after kelco 
succeeded in winning more than half the market 
after being repeatedly urged by kelleys lawyer to send a 
message to houston and consider the wealth of the texas company a 
vermont jury awarded kelco 51146 in compensatory damages and 6 
million in punitive damages 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld the full amount 
concluding it was not constitutionally excessive 
proponents of large punitive damage awards say they deter illegal 
conduct unlike smaller compensatory awards that may be viewed by 
large corporations as a cost of doing business they also argue that 
wrongdoers often get off scotfree by going undetected or because 
many cannot afford to sue 
but those who favor limiting punitive damages say juries 
capriciously penalize the wealthy in order to benefit those who have 
suffered injuries particularly if the victim is from nearby and the 
wrongdoer is from another state or region 
they also say the costs to society are great in the form of 
skyrocketing liability insurance premiums reduced health care and 
abandoned experimentation in new products 
tortreform proponents cite studies that show punitive damages 
have gone through the roof in recent years for example one study 
showed that the average punitive damage award in personal injury 
cases in cook county ill was 14000 for a fiveyear period 
ending in 1969 and 19 million for a comparable period concluding 
in 1984 
the case is browningferris vs kelco disposal 88556

a pipe burst aboard a soviet nuclear 
submarine in the norwegian sea causing a reactor malfunction and a 
fire but no injuries soviet officials said today the sub billowed 
smoke today as it limped toward port 
norwegian officials criticized soviet officials for not informing 
them fully of the accident the second involving a soviet vessel off 
norway in less than a week and the third in three months 
it is unsatisfactory for us as a neighboring state not to be 
warned defense minister johan joergen holst told a news 
conference 
it is unacceptable foreign minister thorvald stolenberg said 
no radiation leaks were reported aboard the vessel which was of 
a class built in the 1960s to carry nucleartipped cruise missiles 
in moscow soviet defense minister dmitri t yazov said the 
accident happened on the subs energy apparatus while the sub was 
submerged a pipeline of a reactor burst and its seal was broken 
the government newspaper izvestia quoted him as saying 
yazov said the sub switched to backup diesel engines surfaced 
and took on water to cool the reactor he said all crew members were 
safe and the accident did not damage the environment 
yazov said another soviet vessel would escort the ship east to 
severomorsk 
soviet media did not give the name of the echo ii class submarine 
or say whether it was carrying nuclear weapons 
a norwegian northern defense command spokesman said the 
submarine with both nuclear and conventional power apparently 
caught fire at about 5 am in the norwegian sea off northern norway 
we received a telex from soviet murmansk rescue central at 
about 945 am that said the situtation was under control the crew 
was in good shape and that there was no danger of a radiation 
leak maj arne skjaerpe said by telephone 
the submarine was first spotted by norwegian aircraft 70 
northwest of south island which is part of the northern province of 
finnmark 
the vessels crew fired a rocket and waved off a norwegian sea 
king rescue helicopter to indicate it did not want civilian help 
said terje b lien an official at the norway rescue coordination 
center at bodoe officials said it was emitting smoke possibly from 
an auxiliary motor 
the echo ii class dates from the early 1960s it is 
nuclearpowered and normally carries nuclear weapons 
the authoritative british handbook janes fighting ships said 
echo ii submarines are 380 feet long have crews of 90 and eight 
missile silos built for cruise missiles the reference says the 
vessels have two nuclear reactors and two steam turbines 
it was a malfunction in the main power plant the official 
soviet news agency tass reported in moscow 
according to commander of the submarine there was a breakdown 
in the system that insures air and water tightness of the reactor 
the reactor has been shut down there are no casualties the 
report said 
the submarine was on the surface and moving toward home under its 
own power ships and aircraft of the soviet northern fleet have been 
sent to the area the report said 
norways rescue coordination center said the submarine was first 
spotted at 71 degrees 36 minutes north and 21 degrees 5 minutes east 
on april 7 a soviet mikeclass submarine caught fire and sank in 
the norwegian sea killing 42 soviet sailors 
on june 20 soviet cruise ship maxim gorky was torn open by ice 
and nearly sank near norways spitzbergen island no casualties were 
reported among the roughly 950 people aboard

the supreme court today gave police permission 
to stray from the precise wording of the famous miranda warnings 
given to criminal suspects 
the decision reached by a 54 vote reinstated an indiana mans 
conviction and 35year prison sentence for attempted murder 
the warning familiar to every fan of television police shows 
was created by the high court in a 1966 decision called miranda vs 
arizona it was designed to bolster criminal suspects fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination 
under the court ruling police must warn suspects in custody of 
their right to remain silent that anything they say can be used 
against them and that they have a right to a lawyers help before 
answering any questions 
suspects also must be told that a lawyer will be provided to them 
if they cannot afford to hire one and that the warnings must be 
given before any police interrogation begins 
in the case decided today hammond ind police questioned gary 
eagan in 1982 about an attempted murder after reading him a warning 
that included this paragraph 
you have a right to the advice and presence of a lawyer even if 
you cannot afford one we have no way of giving you a lawyer but one 
will be appointed for you if you wish if and when you go to 
court 
eagan subsequently confessed to the crime and did so again 29 
hours later after being read a miranda warning that did not include 
the if and when language 
like some other states indiana does not provide pennyless 
criminal suspects with free lawyers until their first appearance in 
court the miranda right to a lawyers help is accommodated by 
police not initiating any contact with a suspect who has asked for 
legal help 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals ruled in eagans case that 
the if and when language of the warning hammond police gave him 
was confusing the wording could lead someone to think he properly 
may be questioned by police without a lawyer the appeals court said 
other federal appeals courts have allowed warnings containing 
such wording 
today the justices said the 7th circuit court was wrong 
in our view the court of appeals misapprehended the effect of 
the inclusion of the if and when you go to court language in 
miranda warnings chief justice william h rehnquist wrote 
this instruction accurately described the procedure for the 
appointment of counsel in indiana he said 
the court also ruled that the 1966 miranda decision does not 
require that lawyers be provided as soon as they are requested 
only that police halt their questioning 
justices byron r white sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and 
anthony m kennedy joined rehnquist in the majority 
justices thurgood marshall william j brennan john paul stevens 
and harry a blackmun dissented 
in a 1981 decision the court said talismanic incantations of 
a defendants rights are not required so long as the right to a 
lawyers help is not linked to a future point in time after the 
police interrogation 
both indiana prosecutors and eagan cited the 1981 ruling as 
favorable to their side 
eagan telephoned chicago police on may 16 1982 and told them he 
had found a dead naked woman along the lake michigan shore in 
indiana 
when he led police to her the stillalive woman looked at eagan 
and exclaimed why did you stab me 
the woman later testified that eagan and two other men had taken 
her to the indiana beach from chicago and that she had sex with the 
two other men when she refused eagan she said he stabbed her 
chicago police turned the case over to hammond police 
the case is duckworth vs eagan 88317

prisoners in exchange for soviet soldiers captured by guerrillas 
during the 10yearold war rebel sources said today 
soviet diplomats however said final approval of the prisoner 
swap must come from the sovietbacked government in kabul 
an exchange agreement was reached at a fourth round of talks 
today between moslem guerrilla representatives and the soviet 
embassy in islamabad a guerrilla spokesman said on condition of 
anonymity 
he said both sides will exchange lists of prisoners at talks to 
be held within the next week 
he said the soviets endorsed the principle of exchanging 
prisoners at one time en masse as previously demanded by the 
insurgents 
a soviet embassy statement however said moscow will open talks 
with kabul on the proposed exchange 
if the russians agreed then kabul will also the guerrilla 
spokesman said 
the guerrillas claim 40000 of their people are missing in action 
they say they are holding between 50 and 75 soviet soldiers 
inside afghanistan moscow says 311 of its troops have gone missing 
since its sent troops to bolster the kabul governments fight 
against the anticommunist guerrillas nine years ago the last red 
army troops withdrew in february under a unbrokered agreement 
this latest round of prisoner negotiations comes while an 
eightmember soviet delegation is visiting pakistan including three 
mothers and a father of red army soldiers missing in afghanistan 
they insist their group is unofficial 
delegation spokesman iona andronov said that over the past two 
days we spoke with the proper people in moscow and kabul and 
received assurances that we can arrange for this exchange 
the soviet parents sought information about their children during 
a meeting last week with guerrilla leaders in pakistans frontier 
city peshawar

the supreme court today rejected arguments by 
citizen groups in yonkers ny that a federal judge illegally 
ordered construction of 1000 lowcost homes to help desegregate the 
city 
the justices without comment threw out an appeal by save 
yonkers federation inc and others it contended that us district 
judge leonard b sand exceeded his authority in ordering the 
desegregation plan 
the yonkers case attracted national attention a year ago when 
four yonkers councilmen refused to obey sands orders to adopt the 
plan and were fined 3500 each for contempt of court 
faced with massive layoffs of city workers the city council 
reversed itself on sept 10 1988 by voting to comply with the 
judges order to build the lowcost homes 
the supreme court last march agreed to decide whether sand had 
the power to fine the councilmen a ruling in that case is expected 
sometime in 1990 
but the high court previously left intact sands 1985 ruling that 
yonkers officials intentionally and unlawfully promoted racial 
segregation through their housing and school policies 
the suit against the officials was begun by the federal 
government in the waning days of president jimmy carters 
administration in 1980 
in the case acted on today the citizens groups said sands order 
to build the homes in middleclass areas would leave untouched 
racial segregation in the citys predominantly black hispanic area

the supreme court broadly interpreting a key 
federal antiracketeering law made it easier today to use the law 
in civil lawsuits against businesses accused of fraud 
the court said unanimously that the law applies to more than what 
is traditionally described as organized crime 
also justice william j brennan said for the court that to prove 
a pattern of racketeering activity under the law a private 
plaintiff or a prosecutor must show at least two criminal acts 
within a single scheme that were related and that amounted to or 
threatened the likelihood of continued criminal activity 
brennan rejected arguments that a plaintiff or prosecutor must 
prove separate illegal schemes to demonstrate a pattern of 
racketeering activity 
moreover he continued the law is designed to apply to more than 
traditional organized crime 
the occasion for congress action was the perceived need to 
combat organized crime brennan said but congress for cogent 
reasons chose to enact a more general statute one which although 
it had organized crime as its focus was not limited in application 
to organized crime 
the court unanimously reinstated a lawsuit against northwestern 
bell telephone co by minnesota consumers the suit was based on 
alleged violations of the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt 
organizations act or rico 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals dismissed the suit which 
accused northwestern bell of bribing state public utility officials 
the consumers say the phone company in 1980 began trying 
illegally to win rate increases by offering gifts employment and 
other favors to members of the minnesota public utilities commission 
the appeals court ruled that the phone companys customers failed 
to prove a pattern of racketeering activity required to make a 
case under rico 
the 8th circuit court said a single fraudulent scheme is 
insufficient ruling that at least two schemes must be alleged 
other federal appeals courts have allowed civil rico suits based 
on numerous acts advancing only one fraudulent scheme 
it is not unusual nowadays to find at least one rico claim in 
lawsuits involving virtually any business dispute the stigma 
attached to being linked in public court documents to alleged 
racketeering can be powerful leverage for outofcourt settlements 
winners of rico lawsuits may collect triple damages and lawyer 
fees both of which generally are not available under state 
antifraud laws 
justice department lawyers in a friendofthecourt brief 
submitted last year sided with the phone customers in urging the 
justices to interpret the rico law broadly and reinstate the lawsuit 
also backing the customers were 14 states arizona california 
connecticut idaho michigan new jersey new mexico north 
carolina oregon texas washington west virginia wisconsin and 
wyoming 
other interests urged the high court to bar the lawsuit for 
example the aflcio said in a friendofthecourt brief that 
private civil rico actions have become a tool of harassment 
against legitimate businesses and labor organizations 
during an oral argument session before the justices last 
november a lawyer for northwestern bell said the 1970 law is aimed 
at thwarting organized crime and should not be used against 
otherwise legitimate businesses accused of fraud 
but the lawyer representing the companys customers said 
businesses that engage in fraudulent acts forfeit the right to 
call themselves legitimate

the supreme court today rejected appeals by 
three convicted drug dealers who said italianamericans unlawfully 
were barred from serving as jurors at their trial 
the court without comment left intact the case of the three men 
convicted in connection with the shipment of cocaine from florida to 
new jersey 
the three are giacomo dinorscio and gerald cohen each sentenced 
to 30 years in prison and anthony truglia sentenced to 10 years 
at their 1986 trial in newark nj federal prosecutors used 
what are known as peremptory or automatic challenges to exclude 
five potential jurors with italian surnames 
the defendants said elimination of those potential jurors 
violated a 1986 supreme court ruling that said prosecutors never may 
disqualify potential jurors based on their race 
the 1986 case involved exclusion of black potential jurors and 
the justices said prosecutors must explain their reasons for 
peremptory challenges if there is evidence the exclusions are 
racially motivated 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals last december ruled against 
the defendants in the new jersey case 
the appeals court said they failed to show that persons with 
italian surnames are themselves an identifiable ethnic group 
that shares common backgrounds and ideas linked to a single culture 
and group loyalties 
the appeals court said there was no evidence this group has 
been systematically excluded from jury service in new jersey 
the 3rd circuit court also said the defendants failed to prove 
any actual prejudice against them particularly since two jurors who 
did serve at the trial had italian surnames 
claims by dinorscio and truglia that five years was tacked on to 
their prison sentences improperly also were rejected by the appeals 
court 
the five years were added under a federal law that permits longer 
sentences for defendants who commit crimes while free on bail 
awaiting trial 
the defendants said they were not alerted to the possibility of 
the additional prison sentences when freed on bail 
the appeals court also rejected cohens argument that he was 
indicted by a grand jury that lacked adequate representation by 
blacks hispanicamericans and people with less than high school 
educations 
the cases are dinorscio vs us 881664 and cohen vs us

the supreme court today agreed to set 
guidelines on when employers may withdraw recognition of a labor 
union after hiring new workers to break a strike 
the court said it will hear a bush administration appeal of a 
ruling favoring an employer in a case stemming from a 1979 strike 
against a texas laboratory supplies company 
curtin matheson scientific inc was struck in 1979 by workers at 
its warehouse in houston after a union contract expired and the 
company locked out all 27 teamsters union members employed there 
five of the 27 employees crossed the picket line when the strike 
began june 13 1979 the company 12 days later hired 29 new 
employees to replace the remaining 22 strikers 
when the union later offered to end the strike under terms 
previously offered by management the company withdrew the offer 
along with its recognition of the union as the workers bargaining 
agent 
the national labor relations board in 1987 said the company 
illegally withdrew its recognition of the union the board said the 
company acted without adequate reason to believe the union lacked 
support from a majority of the workers then at the plant 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals overruled the board last 
november 
the company was justified in doubting that the striker 
replacements supported the union the appeals court said 
bush administration lawyers said the labor board properly refused 
to accept the companys presumption that the union had lost the 
support of the majority of workers 
strikebreakers may choose to work for financial reasons or they 
may disapprove of a strike while still supporting the union justice 
department lawyers told the court 
the case is nlrb vs curtin matheson 881685

justice minister dan meridor today said israel 
should deport more palestinian activists in its efforts to end the 
18monthold palestinian uprising in the occupied territories 
in the occupied west bank arab reports today said the body of a 
woman suspected of cooperating with israeli security forces was 
found in the city of nablus she had been beaten to death with clubs 
and sharp objects 
in ramle peace activist abie nathan today went on trial on 
charges of violating an israeli law that bans contacts with the 
palestine liberation organization nathan 63 was indicted late 
last year for meeting plo chief yasser arafat and several of his 
aides in tunisia and france in september 1988 
meridor called for more deportations of palestinians in an 
interview on army radio one day after the justice and defense 
ministries formed a committee to devise tougher measures against 
palestinian protesters 
i think deportation is serious but must be used i would say 
perhaps even more than what has been done until now meridor said 
i think its an effective punishment when we have appropriate 
evidence 
palestinians said the slain woman sabah el khadi kanaan 30 was 
accused of collaborating with israels secret police 
at least 68 suspected collaborators have been killed by other 
palestinians since the uprising began in december 1987 in the west 
bank and gaza strip a total of 536 palestinians and 23 israelis 
have died during the revolt 
the new committee on putting down the uprising was formed sunday 
to examine proposals by defense minister yitzhak rabin for speeding 
deportations and the demolishion of houses of palestinians suspected 
of security offenses 
rabin also reportedly wants to lengthen the period for holding 
arab suspects without trial from six months t a year 
the united states and human rights organizations repeatedly have 
criticized all three methods of punishment because they are carried 
out without due process of law or violate international conventions 
on human rights 
israeli news reports said that meridor had resisted some of the 
steps proposed by rabin but meridor told army radio that he 
expected stronger measures especially on deporations could be 
worked out in a few days 
meridor said 50 deportations have been carried out since the 
start of the uprising and another five are being appealed before 
israeli courts he said nearly 300 houses have been demolished or 
sealed

states are free to impose the death penalty for 
murderers who committed their crimes while age 16 and 17 the 
supreme court ruled today separately the court ruled that the 
constitution does not categorically prohibit the execution of 
mentally retarded killers 
but in splintered voting in a texas case the court said 
sentencing juries and judges must be allowed to take into 
consideration a murder defendants mental retardation 
ruling in juvenilekillings cases the justices voted 54 that 
the death penalty for older juvenile killers does not violate the 
constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment the ruling 
could affect about 25 of the some 2200 death row inmates across the 
nation 
an eagerly anticipated decision on abortions webster vs 
reproductive health services was not announced today 
the court also meets on thursday which is the last day of the 
term if the webster decision does not come down thursday the court 
could order a rehearing in the term beginning the first monday in 
october 
in other action today the court 
ruled the constitutions ban on excessive fines places no limit 
on how much money can be won in personalinjury lawsuits 
by a 72 vote the justices refused to extend the prohibition 
against the excessive fines to civil as well as criminal cases 
gave police permission to stray from the precise wording of the 
famous miranda warnings given to criminal suspects 
the decision reached by a 54 vote reinstated an indiana mans 
attemptedmurder conviction and 35year prison sentence 
made it easier to use the law in civil lawsuits against 
businesses accused of fraud 
broadly interpreting a key federal antiracketeering law the 
court unanimously ruled that the law applies to more than what is 
traditionally described as organized crime 
in the juvenilekiller decision the court upheld the death 
sentences of two young killers in missouri and kentucky they were 
16 and 17 respectively when they committed their crimes 
justice antonin scalia wrote for the court that no national 
consensus exists against the execution of murderers who committed 
their crimes while minors 
in the decision involving capital punishment for mentally 
retarded killers the court threw out a convicted texas murderers 
death sentence but rejected his lawyers arguments that capital 
punishment always is impermissible for retarded murderers 
scalia said in the juvenilekiller decision that of the 37 states 
permitting capital punishment 15 decline to impose it for anyone 
who committed the crime when not yet 18 
this does not establish the degree of national consensus this 
court has previously thought sufficient to label a particular 
punishment cruel and unusual scalia said 
he was joined in that holding by chief justice william h 
rehnquist and justices byron r white sandra day oconnor and 
anthony m kennedy 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall harry a blackmun 
and john paul stevens dissented 
the justices in effect drew the allowable line for capital 
punishment at age 16 last year when they voted 53 to throw out 
the death sentence of an oklahoma killer who committed his crime 
when 15 
today that line held up 
in the missouri case heath wilkins now 20 was sentenced to die 
by lethal injection for murdering liquor store clerk nancy allen 
during a 1985 robbery in avondale mo 
wilkins first stabbed mrs allen the 26yearold mother of two 
in the back and chest as she pleaded for mercy he stabbed her four 
times in the throat 
the robbery netted for wilkins and three other homeless 
teenagers 450 in cash and checks cigarettes rolling papers 
cheap wine and peppermint schnapps 
in the kentucky case kevin stanford was sentenced to death in 
the states electric chair for the 1981 abduction and murder of 
baerbel poore 20 a gas station attendant in louisville 
stanford now 25 and two others robbed the station of 14307 in 
cash 300 cartons of cigarettes and two gallons of gasoline 
police said stanford and another teenager sexually abused and 
terrorized ms poore in the gas stations bathroom then forced her 
into her car and drove to a wooded area stanford allowed ms poore 
a last cigarette then shot her twice in the head 
the clearinghouse on georgia prisons and jails a group opposed 
to capital punishment estimates that between 12 percent and 20 
percent of the some 2200 people on death rows across the nation 
function at belowaverage intelligence 
the justices split 54 in ruling that johnny paul penrys rights 
were violated because his sentencing jury was not given a sufficient 
opportunity to take his mental capacity into account 
penry has the reasoning capacity of a 7yearold 
oconnor brennan marshall blackmun and stevens formed the 
majority on that portion of the decision sparing at least for now 
penrys life 
but a separate voting bloc oconnor rehnquist white scalia 
and kennedy prevailed in a separate 54 decision that stopped 
short of outlawing capital punishment for all retarded killers 
while a national consensus against execution of the mentally 
retarded may someday emerge reflecting the evolving standards of 
decency that mark the progress of a maturing society there is 
insufficient evidence of such a consensus today oconnor wrote 
jurors who sentenced penry were told they could consider all 
evidence presented by the defense which included testimony about 
penrys retardation 
but the judge refused to make special instructions aimed at 
highlighting penrys mental condition for example penrys trial 
lawyer had requested that the word deliberately be defined for 
jurors 
today the court said that when such a request is made it must 
be honored 
penry 32 was sentenced to die by lethal injection for the 1979 
murder of pamela moseley carpenter 22 in livingston texas 
prosecutors said penry raped the young woman and then killed her 
so she could not identify him for authorities she lived long enough 
to give police a description of her assailant 
mrs carpenter the sister of former national football league 
placekicker mark moseley was stabbed repeatedly in the chest with a 
scissors she had been using to make halloween decorations 
the cases are stanford vs kentucky 875765 wilkins vs 
missouri 876026 and penry vs texas 876177

the supreme court today set aside a ruling that 
a key civil rights law does not protect aliens from discrimination 
by businesses or other private citizens 
the high court ordered a lower court to reconsider the case of a 
new orleans man from india who was denied a bank credit card because 
he is not a us citizen 
the justices said the lower court should restudy the case in 
light of the high courts june 15 ruling reaffirming that a 
centuryold civil rights law applies to alleged discrimination by 
private citizens 
the first national bank of commerce in new orleans was accused of 
illegal bias by jeetendra bhandari a citizen of india who applied 
for a visa or master card credit card in 1983 
bank officials said they rejected bhandaris application in part 
because he is not a us citizen 
bhandari an accountant sued the bank in federal court he 
charged it with violating a postcivil war law now commonly 
referred to as section 1981 that prohibits racial discrimination 
the entire 5th us circuit court of appeals by a 76 vote 
ruled last october that section 1981 does not ban private acts of 
discrimination against aliens 
judge thomas gee in his opinion for the courts majority said 
racial and citizenship distinctions are things of a different 
kind the latter is not so readily and roundly condemned 
he added when all is said and done patriotism remains a civic 
virtue and one whose allegiance is bound to another nation may not 
be suited for certain callings in ours and while the alien guest is 
not without his own special claims upon us arising from our moral 
tradition they are of a different quality from those grounded in 
our common humanity 
the appeals court noted that at the time of its ruling there was 
a split on the supreme court on whether section 1981 bans private 
acts of discrimination as opposed to bias practiced by government 
even against blacks or other racial minorities 
the high court announced on april 25 1988 it would consider 
overturning its own 1976 decision allowing people to use section 
1981 to sue private citizens for race discrimination 
but on june 15 the justices upheld the 1976 ruling while also 
deciding that the 19th century law does not permit suits charging 
onthejob racial harassment 
also the court in may 1987 expanded the scope of section 1981 to 
include not only racial minorities but jews arabs and other ethnic 
groups as well 
bhandari in the appeal acted on today said the 5th circuit 
court dismissal of his suit conflicts with high court precedent 
the appeals court ruling presents a direct conflict with 
supreme court decisions holding that section 1981 prohibits 
discrimination against noncitizens based on alienage and that 
section 1981 prohibits discrimination in the making of private 
contracts lawyers for bhandari said 
the case is bhandari vs first national bank of commerce 871293

the supreme court today refused to kill a 1984 
lawsuit against two chicago lawyers stemming from their defending 
the city against charges of discrimination within its police 
department 
the court without comment turned away arguments that government 
defense lawyers never may be sued for civil damages based on what 
they do for their public client in a case 
nineteen chicago police officers sued the city and various 
officials in 1984 alleging discrimination in employment 
james montgomery then the citys corporation counsel and donald 
hubert one of montgomerys top assistants represented chicago in 
the case 
they were named as defendants in a subsequent lawsuit it alleges 
that montgomery and hubert violated the federal fair credit 
reporting act by hiring an investigative firm to obtain through 
false pretenses credit reports on the police officers who had sued 
the city 
the suit against montgomery and hubert alleges that they intended 
to use the information to embarrass and intimidate the officers 
montgomery and hubert sought to have the lawsuit against them 
dismissed they said they are entitled to absolute immunity from 
civil liability because the alleged misconduct occurred as part of 
their representing chicago in the jobdiscrimination suits 
us district judge harry leinenweber refused to dismiss the 
suit and the 7th us circuit court of appeals upheld his ruling 
last oct 21 
the appeals court said that because the alleged misconduct was 
investigatory in nature and allegedly occurred outside federal 
rules it was removed from the judicial process and is not a 
function that rests uniquely within the duties of an advocate 
throughout most of its opinion the appeals court seemed to 
acknowledge that government defense lawyers are entitled to the same 
absolute immunity from civil lawsuits afforded government 
prosecutors 
but in concluding the appeals court said we express no 
opinion on whether under similar circumstances the unique 
functions performed by prosecuting attorneys would entitle them to 
greater immunity than afforded government defense counsel 
in the appeal acted on today chicago corporation counsel judson 
h miner represented montgomery and hubert he said the appeals 
court ruling is a dangerous narrowing of immunity that will 
damage rather than promote the public concerns that gave rise to 
the doctrine of absolute immunity for public attorneys 
miner added this is the first case to deny government defense 
attorneys absolute immunity for conduct alleged to have been 
undertaken in the course of representing their public client 
the case is montgomery vs auriemma 881439

the supreme court today ordered a lower court 
to restudy a dispute over drug and alcohol testing for employees of 
a mass transit agency in the philadelphia area 
the justices said the lower court should reexamine its ruling in 
light of recent decisions that allowed the conrail railroad to adopt 
drug tests for its workers without first bargaining with its unions 
and allowed mandatory drug testing of railroad employees involved in 
accidents 
in the case acted on today a lower court ruling was challenged 
by both the workers and their employer the southeastern 
pennsylvania transportation authority known as septa 
septa and its workers are unhappy with different aspects of a 
ruling last december by the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court said septa did not violate the privacy rights 
of employees in safety sensitive jobs by requiring them to 
undergo random drug and alcohol tests 
but the appeals court based on narrower grounds barred the 
agency from testing any employees covered by the federal railway 
labor act 
the federal law bars railroads from unilaterally adopting any 
such major change in working conditions the appeals court said it 
said the unions that challenged the tests are entitled to mediation 
and conciliation procedures spelled out by the law 
the supreme court ruled on june 19 that conrail may use 
previously approved physical fitness tests to screen for drug use 
it said the addition of drug screening is a minor change not 
warranting collective bargaining 
conrails tests are not random they are to be administered 
periodically to all workers during routine physical examinations in 
addition employees returning to work after an absence would have to 
undergo the tests 
the high court last march 21 issued two key rulings on drug and 
alcohol testing in the workplace the justices upheld blood and 
urine tests for railroad workers involved in accidents and upheld 
urine tests for us customs service employees seeking 
drugenforcement jobs 
in the case acted on today septa announced in 1987 its plan to 
require random urine and breathalyzer tests for thousands of workers 
with jobs affecting the safety of its more than a million daily bus 
train streetcar and subway riders 
the agency also adopted tests for employees returning to work 
after absences those tests were declared unconstitutional by the 
3rd circuit court and septa and its unions subsequently reached a 
settlement on the returntowork tests 
the cases are septa vs transport workers union 881486 and 
united transportation union vs septa 881653

the supreme court refused today to allow 
resident aliens sue in federal court to collect retroactive 
unemployment benefits from the state of colorado 
the action comes 11 days after the justices ruled that congress 
has the power to strip state governments of their constitutional 
immunity against private lawsuits 
at issue in the colorado case was whether such state immunity 
should be overcome lower courts said no 
a policy of the colorado department of labors division of 
employment and training of refusing to pay unemployment benefits to 
some previously employed aliens lawfully living in the state sparked 
a 1984 lawsuit 
the suit sought to have the policy declared a violation of the 
federal unemployment tax act and to collect benefits it alleged were 
wrongfully withheld 
a federal trial judge ruled that the aliens would have to pursue 
their claims through state administrative proceedings the aliens 
appealed but the 10th us circuit court of appeals dismissed the 
suit nov 29 
noting that state court rulings and changes in immigration law 
made clear that the aliens were eligible for unemployment benefits 
the appeals court rendered moot the need for future relief 
regarding the claims for back benefits the 10th circuit court 
said the 11th amendment prohibits such a raid on the state treasury 
in federal court 
the amendment says the judicial power of the united states 
should not be construed to extend to any suit against a state 
by citizens of another state or by citizens or subjects of any 
foreign state 
in decisions dating back to 1890 the supreme court has barred 
anyone instate or out from suing an unconsenting state or state 
officials if the real target is a states treasury but in recent 
years the court has allowed some federal court lawsuits against 
states 
in the case today lawyers for the aliens said the 10th circuit 
courts bar on federal suits to recover back unemployment benefits 
was in conflict with rulings by other federal appeals courts 
the case is esparza vs valdez 881432

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
an illinois doctor ordered to pay 254000 in lawyers fees to those 
who successfully challenged a state abortion law 
the court consistent with a ruling by the justices last week in 
an airline industry bias cae let stand a lower court ruling 
stemming from a 1979 lawsuit challenging an illinois 
abortionregulating law that included criminal penalties for 
physicians who violated it 
a group of doctors sued various state officials saying the law 
violated physicians rights and those of their patients 
a federal judge barred enforcement of the law soon thereafter 
dr eugene diamond and two others asked to intervene in the case as 
defenders of the law 
diamond said he was acting to defend his patients interests and 
his own professional interests 
diamond and another doctor who has since died appealed to the 
supreme court in 1985 to overrule lower court decisions and 
reinstate the law state officials dropped out of the case 
declining to pursue it to the nations high court 
the justices in 1986 ruled that diamond lacked legal standing to 
appeal thus leaving intact the victory won by the laws challengers 
a federal judge and the 7th us circuit court of appeals 
subsequently ordered diamond to help reimburse the winners legal 
fees his share of the attorneys fees with interest is 254000 
the 7th circuit court ruled last may that diamond can be forced 
to help pay the fees even though he did not violate the 
constitutional rights of those who challenged the law only public 
officials and their agents may commit constitutional violations 
the public officials in the case were sued under a key civil 
rights law that authorizes reimbursement of attorneys fees to 
encourage legal representation for those whose rights are violated 
diamond and the others who intervened in the case in defense of 
the law for all practical purposes became the alter ego of 
the state officials the appeals court said 
we cannot ignore the fact that the intervenors unilateral 
decision to join with the state defendants in adamantly 
defending the constitutionality of the abortion act rendered them 
fullfledged parties to the lawsuit the appeals court said 
it added that the intervenors were thoroughly beaten in 
numerous court proceedings by the laws challengers 
the appeals court also rejected diamonds arguments that forcing 
him to help pay the other sides legal fees chills his freespeech 
rights 
a fee reimbursement system is not unlawful simply because it 
forces those who choose voluntarily to interject themselves into 
such lawsuits to think twice before engaging in battle the 
appeals court said 
the case is diamond vs charles 88664

the supreme court today told a lower court to 
consider freeing new york officials from having to continue an 
educational program for a blind severely retarded man after he 
turns 22 
the justices set aside a ruling that required continued state 
support and told a federal appeals court to restudy its ruling in 
light of their june 15 decision in a pennsylvania case 
that decision shields states from federal court lawsuits seeking 
to enforce a federal law to help handicapped children 
the new york case involves clifford burr of new york city who 
turned 21 on dec 30 burr attended at public expense a private 
school for blind and retarded youngsters until he was 16 
new york officials helped pay the cost under the federal 
education of the handicapped act which requires an appropriate free 
public education for handicapped individuals up to age 22 
when the private school closed in 1984 burr was referred to a 
statesupported school the new york institute for the education of 
the blind 
that school refused to accept him saying he needed training in 
life skills and was too retarded to have any academic potential 
a state department of education hearing officer ruled 18 months 
after the private school closed that burr should be admitted the 
institute appealed to the state commissioner of education who 
upheld the decision three months later 
burr was allowed to attend the institutes program for those with 
multiple handicaps 
kenneth and betty burr sued in an attempt to win compensation for 
the two years their son was out of school while the case was 
reviewed 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled in december that 
federal regulations requiring prompt consideration of such cases 
were grossly violated 
it is true that a handicapped child does not have a right to 
demand public education beyond the age of 21 the appeals court 
said 
nevertheless we believe that clifford is entitled to a remedy 
for a deprivation of the right that the federal statute clearly 
provided him a free appropriate education between the ages of 3 
and 21 
the case is sobol vs burr 881493

sears roebuck and co said today it will move its 
6000employee retailing arm from the sears tower to the suburbs 
ending a bidding war that pitted the state of illinois against the 
sunbelt 
the chicago tribune said the nations largest retailer was 
offered 61 million in state incentives to stay in illinois 
sears has been based in chicago for more than a century 
we believe this chicagoland location will serve the best 
interests of our company and its shareholders for decades to come 
chairman edward brennan said in a statement 
brennan said the move to hoffman estates 20 miles outside 
chicago will begin in 2 to 3 years 
last fall sears announced a restructuring plan that included 
selling the 110story sears tower the worlds tallest building 
and shifting sears merchandise group and its 6000 employees to 
less costly quarters 
when the move is completed only about 600 employees of sears 
corporate staff will remain in the sears tower in space leased from 
whoever buys the tower sears huge catalog sales operation is 
already based elsewhere 
the merchandise groups move pitted illinois against sunbelt 
states especially north carolina and texas which scrambled to 
offer tax breaks and other incentives 
the chicago tribune said illinois offered an estimated 61 
million and local tax breaks will be worth about 178 million by 
far the largest incentive package given to a business to move to or 
stay in illinois 
the total proposal that was worked out is extremely competitive 
with alternative sites brennan said he said the hoffman estates 
parcel was selected from about 50 sites in the chicago area and 
other states 
sears estimates that building a campusstyle facility in hoffman 
estates will cost 220 million 
the tribune and the chicago suntimes said the deal was cemented 
sunday after talks between gov james r thompson and brennan 
brennan thanked thompson and legislative leaders for agreeing 
to support the pending legislation which has enabled us to make this 
decision

an article published today in an archaeological 
review said an israeli government timetable for scholarly work on 
the dead sea scrolls is a hoax and a fraud that will delay 
publication of documents that may hold new insights on early judaism 
and christianity 
one member of the scroll publication team frank moore cross of 
the harvard divinity school conceded that publication of the 
documets is proceeding slowly but said the fraud charge in the 
magazine biblical archaeology review is certainly incorrect 
the article by hershel shanks editor of the review said the 
team of scholars assigned to the task originally by the government 
of jordan and later by the government of israel has now become 
more an obstacle to publication than a source of information 
shanks called for opening the materials to research by any 
scholar who so wishes 
the article included a copy of the timetable published by 
israels department of antiquities which calls for completion of 
the work by the end of 1996 
it is a hoax and a fraud shanks wrote it is not a 
timetable at all it doesnt specifiy what happens if the scholars 
dont meet the timetable 
cross reached by telephone in cambridge said the notion that 
the timetable is a fraud if that is the way it is put is certainly 
incorrect 
timetables in scholarly work often are not kept precisely he 
said they are sometimes beaten and they are sometimes delayed 
but the term fraud is wrong 
that the work has proceeded slowly is certainly true cross 
said and this is if you wish the norm rather than something 
unusual in a find of this kind 
the first of the dead sea scrolls a set of ancient hebrew texts 
were found in a cave in 1947 some biblical texts and a collection 
of laws stories and poetry were published soon after their 
discovery even more of them about 400 texts have yet to be 
released 
the problem with these materials is not generally recognized 
cross said these are not scrolls which were found intact the 
ones that have not been published but are in literally hundreds of 
thousands of pieces 
shanks said some of the fragments are deteriorating so rapidly 
that if the outside world cannot see them soon it may never be able 
to see them 
cross however said that while the material is deteriorating it 
is simply untrue that the documents will be lost if not speedily 
published 
the early photographs and the rephotographing that is going on 
now are the way this material will be preserved he said 
publication is not going to add anything to the original negatives 
and the more recent ones 
the best place for them he said would be in a dry place deep 
underground like the caves in which they were preserved for 
centuries 
but he added we cant rebury them

the commodores a black 
american singing group has canceled a july concert in sun city 
because of pressure from antiapartheid groups concert organizers 
said today 
the south african musicians alliance warned last week that it 
planned protests against the groups visit to sun city the capital 
of the nominally independent black homeland of bophuthatswana 
none of south africas race discrimination laws apply in 
bophuthatswana but antiapartheid advocates object to the homeland 
system that designates certain areas of the country for specific 
tribes 
a sun city entertainment official said the musical group has 
since decided not to make the trip 
this action restricts cultural freedom in the same way that 
apartheid abuses peoples freedom of speech and choice said hazel 
feldman entertainment director of sun international which runs the 
hotel and entertainment complex at sun city 
she said 80 percent of 30000 tickets sold for the july 7 concert 
were bought by blacks 
the commodores who have won awards in the states for their 
commitment to the people by the naacp were deeply sincere in their 
belief that their trip would bring joy to their thousands of fans 
while focusing on their commitment to the abolition of apartheid 
she said 
mrs feldman said the commodores whose hits include night 
shift and three times a lady plan to explain their action at 
a los angeles news conference on wednesday 
one member of the group milan williams was quoted by south 
africas weekly mail on friday as saying he would not join the tour 
at that time the other three members of the group and a backing 
band still planned to come 
sun city south africas version of las vegas is the most 
glamorous of the entertainment complexes in the homelands it pays 
premium prices and has attracted such music acts as frank sinatra 
rod stewart and recently laura brannigan and irene cara 
mrs feldman accused the south african musicians alliance of 
hypocrisy we respect many of their views but feel that it is 
totally hypocritical that their members will happily play mmabatho 
independence stadium in bophuthatswana and other homeland 
venues while singling out sun city as the sole target of their 
campaign

president bush said today the battle against 
crime in the streets is also a struggle to end violence against 
women and to expand womens opportunities in the workplace 
this war against women must stop bush declared to cheers at 
a convention of the american association of university women 
making a pitch for his anticrime package the president said 
all too often violent crime also means crime against women 
i am angered and disgusted by the crimes against american women 
and by the archaic and unacceptable attitudes that all too 
frequently contribute to those crimes whether it involves spouse 
abuse at home or violence in the streets said bush these are 
evil acts that transcend racial and class lines this war against 
women must stop 
he said it was just unthinkable that his seven grandaughters 
should not have the same opportunities in life as his four grandsons 
no matter how equal the opportunities in our schools and 
workplace women will never have the same opportunities as men if a 
climate of fear leaves them justificably concerned at walking to the 
campus library at night or reluctant to work late hours for fear of 
getting out of some parking lot safely the president said 
fundamentally violence against women wont subside unless 
public attitudes change we must continue to educate police and 
prosecutors judges and juries and we must engender a climate where 
the message our children get in teleivison and films from schools 
and parents is that violence against women is wrong 
bush received an honorary membership in the 140000member 
organization technically that makes me the first aauw member to 
be president of the united states but i know i wont be the last 
he said to more cheers 
the aauw founded in 1881 promotes equal opportunity and 
advancement for women and girls at all levels of education 
bush was also meeting today with japanese foreign minister 
hiroshi mitsuzuka and portuguese president mario soares 
he was also holding a rose garden reception for former democratic 
state and local officials who have defected to the republican party 
on sunday the president took visiting australian prime minister 
bob hawke out for a friendly game of golf at andrews air force base 
in maryland after entertaining him at camp david 
bush insisted his golfing skills were just terrible 
i dont play golf he said im doing this just for good 
will between australia and the united states 
bush will give hawke a ceremonial greeting and host a state 
dinner in his honor at the white house on tuesday

prospective homebuyers failed to take advantage 
of falling mortgage rates in may when sales of existing homes fell 
56 percent to their lowest level in 16 months a real estate trade 
group reported monday 
the national association of realtors said sales of singlefamily 
homes fell last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 321 
million units down from 34 million units in both march and april 
the may resale rate was off 113 percent from a year ago the 
realtors said and was the lowest since 32 million units were sold 
in january 1988 
the federal home loan mortgage corp said fixedrate mortgage 
interest dropped from 1097 percent the first week of may to 1048 
percent at the end of the month 
the federal reserve recently relaxed slightly the grip it has 
held on the credit supply to restrain the economy and hold down 
inflation 
fed vice chairman manuel johnson on monday suggested the 
possiblity of a further interest rate decline when questioned about 
inflation after addressing the united shareholders association 
well thats a neverending process the fight against 
inflation johnson said so i dont think we can ever be 
totally confident but i think we are more optimistic about the 
upcoming period and i think conditions look pretty good 
nevertheless realtors president ira gribin said of the lag in 
response to mays falling intest rates 
buyers are not going to start flooding the markets the instant 
mortgage rates start to go down it takes time for the tide to 
change 
but gribin suggested the pace of existing home sales will pick up 
in june as people begin to take advantage of lower mortgage rates 
the realtors said the median price of existing homes in may was 
93100 up 200 from april the median is the point at which half 
of the homes sold for more and half for less 
the decline in sales was sharpest in the midwest where there had 
been steady activity earlier this year sales were down 101 percent 
below april to a rate of 800000 units 
the west which also had been largely unaffected by mortgage 
rates earlier this year also posted a notable resale decline to 
570000 units down 81 percent below the april rate 
sales of 590000 units in the northeast were 33 percent below 
april sales in the south dropped to 123 million units down 39 
percent from april

a report today that federal officials are 
underestimating the spread of aids raises questions about the 
nations ability to cope with the crisis say congressmen who are 
monitoring the epidemic 
a general accounting office report says the number of aids cases 
expected to be diagnosed over the next three years has been 
undercounted by as much as onethird by the centers for disease 
control 
the really frightening aspect of this report is it proves how 
little we know about the aids epidemic rep ron wyden dore 
said sunday he and reps john dingell dmich and henry waxman 
dcalif requested the study 
when these projections of aids cases go awry it undermines 
research destroys the validity of our plans for taking care of aids 
victims and conveys a false sense of confidence to our fellow 
citizens that the aids epidemic is under control wyden said 
the gao in a report being released today estimated that 300000 
to 480000 americans will have been diagnosed with aids by the end 
of 1991 
this compares with cdcs estimated range of 185000 to 320000 
cases through 1991 
the cdc has done the best they could but theyve been 
underfunded waxman said on nbcs today show we need a new 
survey in this country about american sexual patterns which we 
havent had for 40 years 
the united states has the best aids reporting system in the 
world dr james mason assistant secretary of health and former 
director of the cdc said on the same show thats why more than 
60 percent of the cases reported in the world have been reported by 
the united states we can always do better however 
meanwhile the food and drug administration today announced 
approval of a drug to treat an eye infection in aids patients that 
can lead to blindness it is the fourth drug to be approved for 
treatment of aids or an aidsrelated condition 
the drug ganciclovir has been widely available for several 
months to aids patients with the eye infection cytomegalovirus 
retinitis under a special fda category called treatment ind 
that allows distribution of promising drugs to the gravely ill while 
safety and effectiveness research continues 
about 20 percent of aids patients develop the eye infection 
syntex corp of palo alto calif will market the drug under the 
name cytovene 
the fda also announced treatment ind status for an 
experimental protein rerythropoietin to treat severe anemia that 
weakens nearly half of the 20000 patients taking the antiviral 
drug azt 
fda commissioner frank young said the two actions reflect the 
agencys commitment to getting promising new drugs to aids victims 
quickly he said that while there still is no cure for the disease 
these two drugs and others recently approved for commercial release 
and treatment inds can extend and improve the lives of aids 
patients making early diagnosis more important 
the gao evaluated 13 national forecasts of the cumulative number 
of aids cases through the end of 1991 and found a range of 
predictions from 85000 to 750000 cases the report looked only at 
the number of potential aids cases not the number of people who 
test positive for the aidscausing human immunodeficiency virus but 
show no symptoms of aids 
projections of the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
are important because they are used in deciding how much money is 
spent on aids education research projects and public health care 
services for aids patients 
also if faulty forecasting is underestimating the heterosexual 
spread of aids as the report concludes the result may be luring 
a significant number of americans into a false sense of security 
wyden said 
sunday editions of the washington post said cdc officials 
acknowledged serious underreporting of aids cases but said gao 
projections were too high 
the report blamed the undercounting on a variety of factors 
including the absence of data on the size of risk groups the 
definition of what constitutes an aids case reliance on incomplete 
surveillance data and the undercounting of heterosexuals at risk 
the report said cdc must get more uptodate and accurate 
information about the risk groups if it hopes to improve its 
projections 
earlir this month a university of chicago study also said cdc 
may be significantly underestimating the number of americans with 
aids the study attributed some of the undercounting to affluent 
victims who are treated discreetly by physicians who do not report 
cases of the disease 
aids is spread by close contact with blood blood products or 
semen from infected people its chief victims are homosexual men and 
intravenous drug users 
as of may 31 1989 aids had been diagnosed in 97193 americans 
of whom more than half or 56468 have died since june 1 1981 
according to the cdc no one is known to have recovered from aids

the 420000 gallons of oil spilled from a 
tanker off rhode island had largely dispersed or evaporated by this 
morning officials said hundreds of people worked to clean up 
spills in delaware and texas 
things were much much better than yesterday stephen g 
morin a state environmental official said after flying over the 
stricken world prodigy which ran aground on a reef friday at the 
mouth of narragansett bay 
in delaware officials also were optimistic saying the much 
heavier oil spilled in the delaware river on saturday was so 
congealed in the cool water that shoreline damage was minimal 
workers used rakes to remove footballsize tarlike gobs from the 
river where up to 800000 gallons spilled 
as a tropical storm approached texas crews there brought in 
supersucker vacuums to clean up a 250000gallon spill near 
houston 
morin rhode island director of groundwater and wetlands said he 
and other officials flew more than 14 miles offshore and found only 
one small patch of oil about four miles out that he said was 
unlikely to reach shore 
i havent seen it anywhere on the beaches weve flown today 
he said 
nevertheless gov edward d diprete ordered beaches to remain 
closed today and a ban on shellfishing remained in effect 
since lobsters flounders cod and haddock important to the 
regions fishing industry are now laying eggs it is the worst 
possible time for an oil spill said kenneth sherman of the national 
marine fisheries service fish can swim away from the slick but 
larvae dont have that mobility he said 
diprete said the captain of the greeklicensed world prodigy 
iakovis georgudis admitted he failed to wait for a pilot and 
mistakenly changed course sending the ship toward rocks 
hours after the accident a tanker and an oil barge collided in 
the houston ship channel that connects the texas city with galveston 
bay causing a spill and early saturday heavy oil spilled in the 
delaware river after an uruguayan tanker ran aground 
results of drug tests on georgudis and a mate whose name was not 
immediately available were expected by late today although the 
coast guard said drugs or alcohol were not believed to have been 
factors in the accident 
the crewmens urine samples were mishandled reportedly through 
improper refrigeration and new ones had to be taken 19 hours after 
the accident the coast guard said 
a federal inquiry will be convened tuesday coast guard adm 
richard rybacki said state attorney general james e oneil said he 
hopes to learn if georgudis violated state law by approaching too 
near the bay without a pilot 
the coast guard reduced its estimate of the amount of oil spilled 
to 420000 gallons earlier estimates were as high as 16 million 
about 200 national guardsmen 120 prison inmates and 200 volunteers 
fought the oil 
the oil spread rapidly over nearly 30 square miles at one point 
it threatened block island a fashionable vacation spot but this 
morning officials said that worry had ebbed because the oil was 
evaporating rapidly 
youre reaching the point where youre running out of molecules 
that can go anywhere said a coast guard spokesman chief warrant 
officer rick meidt 
most of rhode islands beaches reopened sunday after overnight 
winds pushed the oil offshore but the governor today closed beaches 
nearly to connecticut 
elsewhere contractors in the delaware river hired 255 employees 
and delaware agreed to provide 300 national guardsmen to help remove 
the heavy fuel oil floating in globs and occasionally washing ashore 
in delaware new jersey and pennsylvania 
federal officials said this morning that shoreline damage was 
minimal coast guard capt larry murdock said there wont be much of 
a problem unless the oil was somehow warmed to 95 degrees or higher 
and liquified 
the tanker refloated sunday was carrying 18 million gallons of 
heating oil officials said that they were unable to account for at 
least 800000 gallons but that the actual spill was probably less 
shoreline contamination was reported from ridley pa on the 
outskirts of philadelphia to new castle del about 30 miles to 
the south 
wildlife officials worked to protect pea patch island home to 
several species of nesting shorebirds crews laid 1700 feet of 
oilretaining booms along the island one of the midatlantics 
largest rookeries one oilcovered duckling died but the coast 
guard said wildlife deaths would probably be limited because the oil 
is so thick it wont easily smear onto animals bodies 
these are important nursing grounds and this is an important 
time of year said thomas malone acting head of the university of 
maryland center for environmental and estuarine studies 
in texas crews aided by wind and waves from the approach of 
tropical storm allison used seven huge vacuum machines to try to 
pick up the oil 
by this morning about a third of the oil had been sucked from 
the bayport channel where the oil was flowing said coast guard 
spokesman bob morehead 
theyre stepping up their cleanup efforts to try to get it out 
before the storm comes in morehead said 
the coast guard scheduled a hearing on tuesday to investigate 
fridays collision of the tanker rachelb and a barge owned by 
coastal towing co of houston

the supreme court setting the stage for an 
important child pornography ruling said today it will decide 
whether states may outlaw possession of lewd material depicting 
child nudity 
the court said it will use an ohio case to explore how far states 
may go to protect children without violating freedom of expression 
the justices ruled in 1982 that states may outlaw material 
depicting sexual performances by children but that ruling stopped 
short of banning mere possession of kiddie porn 
that ruling was aimed at such activities as photographing minors 
in lewd poses or promoting or distributing the material 
in the case acted on today the court will hear arguments during 
its 198990 term beginning in october with a ruling not expected 
until sometime in 1990 
the case stems from the prosecution of clyde j osborne 61 of 
columbus who was sentenced to six months in jail for possessing 
four photos of a nude boy prosecutors said he got the photos from a 
florida mailorder business and had placed them in a photo album in 
his home 
columbus police searched his home in july 1985 after being told 
by a florida postal inspector that two people arrested there said 
osborne had bought photos of nude boys 
the ohio supreme court last july upheld the state law against 
possessing child pornography 
the law makes exceptions for parents or guardians of a child or 
for material that serves a bona fide artistic religious 
governmental judicial or other proper purpose 
the state court rejected arguments that the law is too vague or 
that someone can be convicted under it without realizing he or she 
is committing a crime 
we have no difficulty finding that the jury would have believed 
beyond a reasonable doubt that osborne was aware of the nature of 
the photographs the state court said 
an anticipated us supreme court showdown over possession of 
child pornography fizzled last wednesday when the justices sent a 
massachusetts case back to that states courts for further action 
the case acted on today is osborne vs ohio 885986

the owner of a gas station and 
convenience store caught a burglar breaking into his business over 
the midsummer holiday the 155th attempted breakin in 20 years 
owner william hecktor has foiled 128 burglaries at the station 
according to the dagens nyheter newspaper 
breakins are a rarity in a country that is regarded as having 
little street crime 
the station near eslov in southern sweden is in a remote area 
20 miles from the closest police station police officer soini 
haanpaa said hecktor had learned to depend on himself because there 
is little police can do to help 
with the help of neighbors a sophisticated alarm system and his 
dog he does a fantastic job of deterring crime haanpaa said 
you would think that the word would get around that the station 
is not such a good place for robberies said haanpaa

a committee of journalists reprimanded 
columnist jack anderson on monday for his role in bringing a gun 
into the capitol for a television show on terrorism but did not 
revoke his press credentials he rejected the reprimand 
anderson has said he engineered the plan to smuggle the gun into 
the capitol last month to show a need for better security he did 
not carry in the gun himself 
we believe that you abused your privilege as a credentialed 
member of the daily press gallery and needlessly jeopardized the 
relationship reporters have with the capitol police jeffrey 
birnbaum of the wall street journal wrote in a letter to anderson 
he said the fivemember committee which provides credentials to 
reporters who cover congress has voted unanimously to reprimand 
you for your role in bringing a gun into the capitol last month 
anderson responded with his own letter saying with no 
disrepect intended i must reject the reprimand of the standing 
committee 
he said he knew that several terrorist leaders were planning to 
make the united states their target and that the political leaders 
would be in danger 
im appalled that the congressional leaders whose lives i 
wanted to protect seem less concerned about the threat to their 
security than the political embarrassment i apparently caused them 
during an interview may 24 with sen bob dole rkan in doles 
private office anderson pulled from his pocket a gun that had been 
concealed in his televison crews equipment the incident occurred 
during taping for a segment of his tv program and anderson claimed 
it was to demonstrate security breaches in the building 
but it is a felony to bring a firearm onto the capitol grounds or 
into any of the buildings and capitol police and the us attorney 
are investigating whether to press charges against anderson said 
officer dan nichols 
anderson told the standing committee of correspondents he would 
not be at their meeting unless senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine and dole the minority leader were there 
they did not appear though they had initiated the action by 
asking birnbaum in a june 6 letter to review this serious incident 
and take sufficient action to deter any future repetition of this 
act 
the committee whose leaders are elected by journalists was 
established by congress to decide who should work in the press 
galleries and to allocate space in the galleries 
along with sending a letter of reprimand to anderson the 
committee voted to revise its regulations so that any credentialed 
member who disobeys security rules in the future would be subject to 
suspension 
when you used your position as a reporter to have a weapon 
brought into the capitol and then produced it in the office of sen 
robert dole on may 24 you violated the trust that our extension of 
the credential to you implies said birnbaums letter to anderson 
therefore we admonish you in the strongest terms 
while anderson is credentialed he has not picked up his 
identification tag and was using a visitors pass at the time of the 
incident he said he entered the capitol as an ordinary citizen and 
was afforded no special privileges or treatment because i am a 
journalist 
birnbaum said that he did not recommend suspending the 
investigative reporter because he was not carrying the credential 
there was no precedent for such action and our own rules are 
sufficiently unclear that so drastic a step might be misconstrued as 
the rendering of a judgment by an official press body on the quality 
of mr andersons journalism 
other members of the committee are charles green of knightridder 
newspapers eliot brenner of united press international mary deibel 
of scripps howard news service and thomas gorey of the salt lake 
tribune

the koran using roman script allowing only those in jawi and arabic 
scripts an official said monday 
abdul hamid othman director general of the islamic affairs 
division in the prime ministers department said the ban would take 
effect in about six months 
under the ban anyone possessing the koran in roman script could 
be imprisoned for up to three years or fined about 1850 he said 
the national fatwa committee which rules on islamic matters 
decided to impose the ban because the roman version did not give 
proper pronunciations 
the jawi script looks like arabic or urdu script 
islam is malaysias official religion and about half of its 17

reenactments staged on the great 
battlefields of the civil war usually end the same way with boys 
in blue routing the confederate gray 
but not so in mississippi this summer 
at vicksburg cannons will boom and muskets flash over the fourth 
of july weekend to commemorate a clearcut confederate victory over 
yankee troops when gen ulysses s grant made his first major 
attempt to silence the mississippi river fortress 126 years ago 
and at brices cross roads in lee county scene of a textbook 
attack by confederate gen nathan bedford forrests cavalry 
historians recently replaced 99 markers to unknown southern dead 
with 102 stones bearing the names of rebel soldiers known to have 
been killed in the june 10 1864 battle 
the vicksburg artillery demonstrations and engagements by several 
hundred reenactors will take place saturday and sunday on private 
land in vicksburg where the actual engagement being commemorated 
occurred on may 22 1863 
grants allout attack was beaten back by the vicksburg garrison 
during a oneday battle that resulted in 3000 union soldiers killed 
or wounded the confederates suffered about 500 casualties 
realizing a direct attack would be too costly grant encircled 
the city on land and water starving the garrison into surrender 47 
days later on july 4 1863 
last year was the first year we had a reenactment at vicksburg 
and since it was the 125th anniversary of the siege we felt it 
only appropriate to do the last few days of it including the 
surrender said gordon cotton director of the old court house 
museum and organizer of the vicksburg civil war reenactment 
we did not realize when we planned last years event that 
reliving those days would be so emotionally straining on everyone 
here said cotton 
this year the reenactors wanted to do something different 
something very dramatic and we didnt want to go through another 
defeat he said so this battle was the obvious choice 
across the state in lee county history buff charles sullivan and 
his associates found another way to remember a confederate victory 
up to this point all the battlefields i have marked were of 
confederate defeats said sullivan a department head at 
mississippi gulf coast community colleges perkinston campus and 
confederate graves registrar in mississippi for the sons of 
confederate veterans this time it was different 
at the brices cross roads battlefield about six miles west of 
baldwyn forrest won a major tactical victory over gen sd 
sturgis larger union force when the fighting ended over 1500 
union soldiers had been captured 
for forrest it was a textbook battle that has been studied at 
war colleges around the world said sullivan who will participate 
in the reenactment at vicksburg many believe this was his 
greatest victory for heavily outnumbered he was able to destroy 
the federal cavalry first and then the infantry 
sullivan said the markers to the unknown dead were placed at the 
battle site sometime after 1930 following passage of a federal law 
allowing military stones for fallen confederates 
thanks to the research of a friend named roger hansen who has 
a network of colleagues throughout the country who trade information 
on confederate dead we were able to identify 102 men killed at the 
crossroads on the confederate side 
sullivan said the new markers were arranged in alphabetical order 
because we know they were placed in a burial pit but we do not 
know exactly where each body was situated

rob lowes lawyer asked a judge today to throw out 
a lawsuit accusing the heartthrob actor of videotaping a teenage 
girl during a sex act 
edgar neely told us district judge g ernest tidwell that the 
girls mother who brought the suit has no legal standing to sue 
under a georgia law that allows parents to seek damages over the 
seduction of an minor child 
the judge did not indicate when he would rule 
lowe 25 is accused of making the sexually explicit tape of lena 
jan parsons then 16 and another woman in his hotel suite during 
last summers democratic national convention in atlanta the suit 
was filed may 12 by lena arlene wilson the girls mother who is 
seeking unspecified damages 
neely argued today that even if the allegations were true the 
seduction law is probably unconstitutional ms wilson is not the 
girls custodial parent as required by law and the woman suffered no 
direct emotional harm 
ms wilson does not live with her daughter neely said 
j hue henry ms wilsons lawyer argued that lowe seduced miss 
parsons and that ms wilson has suffered direct harm 
one could see how a parent could and would suffer extreme 
emotional distress from seeing such a tape he said this is a 
case of wanton willful intentional misconduct 
lowe did not attend the hearing 
those who have seen the tape and they are legion dont seem 
to question that they are seeing the face and hearing the voice of 
the star of such films as st elmos fire and about last 
night 
atlantas tv stations have run excerpts over and over and over 
with little shadowy boxes blocking out the participants private 
parts the citys alternative weekly creative loafing reviewed the 
tapes as cinema verite 
rock satirist mojo nixon in a recent atlanta concert reworked 
several of his songs to include verses about the scandal led his 
audience in chants of oh no rob lowe and asked apparently 
seriously if anyone knew where he could see the tapes for himself 
doubtlessly someone in the audience did the tapes have been 
passed around the citys club and party circuit not to mention the 
journalism community so much that bragging about having seen them 
is now out of fashion 
in court papers lowe denied he committed any wrongful acts 
giving rise to liability 
lowes attorneys also have filed papers accusing ms wilson and 
henry of using extortionist tactics to force lowe to pay as much 
as 500000 to avoid bad publicity they also accused ms parsons of 
helping circulate the tape 
i knew they would resort to desperate tactics at some point 
henry responded i expected them to sling all kinds of mud because 
their client is the one on film in compromising positions and there 
is no way they can avoid that fact 
henry said ms wilson rejected a 35000 takeitorleaveit 
offer from lowes attorneys in february but he denied making any 
500000 settlement demands 
the videotape that has circulated shows the man believed to be 
lowe in a room with ms parsons and another woman it shows the 
teenager having sex with the woman with lowe heard and seen 
giving directions like a movie directr but it does not show 
intercourse between the actor and ms parsons a different segment 
of the tape apparently taken at a different time allegedly shows 
lowe having sex with others 
henry has charged in court papers that lowe also had sex with 
miss parsons while watched by an unidentified female 
the fulton county district attorneys office said lowe is under 
investigation on possible charges of sexual exploitation of a minor 
which carries up to 20 years in prison

workers cleaning up a delaware river oil 
spill of up to 800000 gallons used rakes and even their hands this 
morning to pick up gobs of oil so big and heavy they jammed skimming 
machinery 
the oil came from a uruguayan tanker that ran aground near here 
early saturday just south of the pennsylvania line the spill came 
less than 24 hours after big spills in texas and rhode island 
the cause of the accident was under investigation 
officials said that the congealed oil is difficult to clean up 
but has caused little damage to the delaware pennsylvania and new 
jersey coast because the gobs tend to bounce along the shoreline 
rather than spread out 
the brownish blobs range in size from a football to 2 feet or 
more and have the consistency of roofing tar said coast guard 
spokesman rick woods theyre so gooey they can be picked up by hand 
coast guard petty officer dave oney said the oil will have little 
effect on wildlife it is so solidified fish can swim around it 
and a bird would have to fly right into it to get hurt he said 
officials said they could not account for at least 800000 
gallons from the tanker which was carrying 18 million gallons of 
refined industrial heating oil but they said it is doubtful the 
full amount is in the water and there is no sign much of it has 
sunk to the bottom of the river 
the cleanup ran into problems because skimmers called in were 
unable to deal with blobs floating in the water instead the blobs 
were pushed toward shore with booms and then raked in 
david gartin of j amp j spill service of norristown pa manager 
of the cleanup said the job would probably take more than a week 
globs of oil have been spotted as far north as ridley park pa 
on the outskirts of philadelphia and as far south as new castle 
del about 30 miles downstream some oil has also washed onto the 
new jersey side of the delaware river 
the presidente rivera was refloated sunday and taken to its 
original destination the sun co refinery in nearby marcus hook 
pa where most of the remaining oil was loaded into storage tanks 
nelson said that the ship was owned by the uruguayan government 
which is assuming full financial responsibility for the spill 
delaware wildlife officials worked to protect pea patch island 
in the river south of new castle which is home to several species 
of nesting shorebirds crews laid 1700 feet of oilretaining booms 
along the island 
todd nelson a coast guard spokesman in philadelphia said that 
because of the weather water conditions and oil consistency the 
fuel is not breaking up 
the water isnt particularly choppy and there isnt much heavy 
wave action so the oil moves back and forth with the tide he 
said 
nelson said cleanup contractors have hired more than 250 
temporary employees and the state of delaware has agreed to send 300 
national guardsmen 
the system will be operating tomorrow at the maximum capacity 
possible he said sunday as we have never done this type of 
operation before it will take some time to gear up 
coast guard lt jim weakley and gov michael castle said they 
were unable to confirm reports of a mechanical problem aboard the 
ship 
drug and alcohol tests were performed on all personnel involved 
in navigating the ship the results were not immediately available

hundreds of whiterobed 
israeli moslems crossed this army checkpoint monday for the annual 
pilgrimage to mecca and israeli officials urged them to help 
mediate between the jewish state and its arab neighbors 
there has been a lot of hatred mistrust and enmity cabinet 
member ehud olmert said at a ceremony marking the pilgrims crossing 
the bridge to jordan for the trip to saudi arabia 
you can serve as a bridge between israel on the one side and 
arab states and palestinians on the other said olmert the prime 
ministers adviser on arab affairs 
but some of the 5400 israeli arabs pilgrims said they identified 
more with the palestinians 18month uprising in the occupied lands 
than with israel 
we are proud of the uprising it has given us more respect 
outside said hosni nuseirat 42 of the northern israeli village 
of taibeh 
we have deep ties to the palestinians in the occupied 
territories its religion that binds us together and we are all 
members of the same nation nuseirat said 
there are 810000 israeli arab citizens from families who 
remained in israel when the jewish state was founded in 1948 
about 17 million palestinians live in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip including those who fled israel in 1948 and residents of 
the occupied lands before they were captured in the 1967 middle east 
war 
nuseirat and about 1400 other israeli arab pilgrims most in 
white robes and white prayer caps sat in two dozen buses waiting 
for a last security check before crossing the allenby bridge into 
jordan 
women wearing white scarves repacked their belongings after 
searches by soldiers reassembling bed rolls and plastic shopping 
baskets filled with rice sugar olives coffee and tea 
about 5400 israeli arabs up about 400 from last year are 
leaving for mecca via jordan this week they are scheduled to return 
by july 21 
mecca is islams holiest site and making the hajj or 
pilgrimage is one of the chief religious duties of moslems 
saudi arabia and jordan both technically at war with israel 
first permitted israeli arabs to join the hajj in 1977 saudi arabia 
limits the number of pilgrims and israel only gives exit permits to 
moslems who are 30 years of age or older citing security reasons 
we are angry about this in our religion there is no such 
thing as an age limit said yehiah haj 31 also of taibeh 
haj made his first pilgrimage last year and said israeli arabs 
attract much attention in saudia arabia when we say where we are 
from people gather around they want to know whats going on in 
israel he said

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
monday that the federal deficit would double or triple if all 
requests for farm aid were honored 
yeutter speaking at a meeting of the american seed trade 
association said about 75 percent of his mail comes from people 
asking for more government assistance of some kind 
most of these letters are coming from members of congress of 
course reflecting concerns of their constitutents he said 
if the government were to honor all of those pleas for 
additional funding that 150 billion deficit that we have now 
would probably double or treble just based on agricultural requests 
alone aside from what the rest of the economy is asking for 
yeutter said there are many views as to whether american farmers 
have become addicted to federal subsidies 
he said his home state of nebraska last year had a net farm 
income of something over 2 billion of which more than 1 
billion came from the government 
thats pretty addictive he said

in a restaurant and plotted to kill john gotti reputed boss of a 
rival crime family

of the genovese crime family was convicted of conspiracy 
racketeering planning to kill gotti and arranging the murder of

of a turf battle authorities said the fbi tipped gotti to the 
plot which was not carried out 
the 350pound freespending schiff was shot to death in 1987

his dinner companion identified in news reports then only as a 
mysterious blonde who fled the scene was revealed in court as 
judy galip she testified that a masked man fired two shots into

casella who owned a restaurant allegedly used as the organizations 
headquarters was allegedly mannas chief lieutenant and napoli a 
member of the criminal enterprise 
key evidence in the 3month trial was a series of conversations 
secretly taperecorded at casellas restaurant and a coffee shop in 
jersey city 
the defense attacked the tapes as inaudible and said the 
government misinterpreted the conversations and misattributed 
voices they provided jurors with alternate transcripts and said any 
talk of killing gotti was a joke

nearly two years after surgeons separated a pair 
of west german siamese twins connected at the head the children 
remain far from normal doctors say 
patrick binder remains in a vegetative state said david 
nichols a johns hopkins childrens center pediatric 
anesthesiologist who participated in the surgery and now directs the 
hospitals pediatric intensive care unit 
patricks brother benjamin is improving but is clearly not 
normal and developmentally delayed the doctor was quoted as 
saying in mondays editions of the baltimore sun 
the 22hour surgery to separate the then 7monthold twins 
finished sept 6 1987 hospital officials originally predicted a 
sixweek recovery period but the twins remained at hopkins for more 
than seven months when they returned to their home in ulm west 
germany in april 1988 patrick was hospitalized again 
in a technological star wars sort of way the operation was a 
fantastic success said benjamin carson the pediatric 
neurosurgeon who helped direct the surgical team but as far as 
having normal children i dont think it was all that successful 
the parents theresia and josef binder signed a contract with 
the west german magazine bunte giving the magazine exclusive rights 
to the story until the boys reach age 18 because of that the 
binders have refused to talk to the press 
but in an article in april in freizeit revue a west german 
magazine published by the same company that publishes bunte mrs 
binder was critical of hopkins and the care her sons received later 
in west germany 
the doctors in baltimore told her her children would run and 
laugh within a year after their discharge from hopkins she told 
the magazine i took it seriously she said but maybe they 
just wanted to encourage me 
nichols denied hopkins doctors made that claim 
the binders were told that patrick showed signs of severe 
neurological damage and that his recovery potential was uncertain 
he said also there was a question of blindness and hearing 
deficit and they were told that benjamins development would be 
delayed and his ultimate chances of recovery were uncertain

when he pulled into the row of little orange balls 
bus driver donald desmond closed his eyes and let the gods be his 
guide 
the rear tires of his yellow and white massachusetts bay transit 
authority bus came within 1 inches of the markers on either side 
but the 16year veteran of bostons snarled traffic and snarling 
commuters kept his coach in the clear sunday to win the bus 
drivers rodeo and claim the title of top jockey among the citys 
2200 bus drivers 
his next stop the national championships in atlanta in september 
where drivers from 65 cities in the united states and canada are 
expected to compete 
my tongue is down in my gut somewhere he said after taking 
the 40foot bus through 11 obstacles in 5 minutes 36 seconds i 
feel like i can barely breathe 
the finalists in the 13th annual boston bus rodeo negotiated 
hundreds of orange pylons rubber balls and plastic barrels spread 
across a parking lot the size of two football fields 
some of the obstacles mimic maneuvers the drivers have to make 
every working day like making tight righthand turns and squeezing 
between parked cars to pick up passengers other tests such as 
backing up to a pylon or running the gauntlet of rubber balls 
require special practice 
whenever i see a can or a paper cup in the road i try to hit 
it with my right wheel said gus swanson jr a 33year veteran of 
the transit authority that way i get a feel for where my right 
wheel is all the time and when i go through the balls i just 
adjust by 3 inches so i miss them instead of hit them 
the winner of the boston rodeo gets a 200 gift certificate and a 
reserved parking space at work 
you can feel it click when you get a good run like that 
desmond said when i go into the balls though i just close my 
eyes and say god help me

a man whose hypnotized frogs lie on their 
backs and lift tiny barbells might be called a ratbag in australia

happier said david weeks of the royal hospital in edinburgh

studying offbeat people for five years and in an earlier book 
eccentrics the scientific investigation focused on europeans

weeks doesnt believe californians are by nature flaky but 
california seems to take pride in its oddballs he said in an 
interview published sunday 
its very tolerant and proud and nurturing of eccentricity 
he said in some parts of the world by contrast eccentricity is 
denigrated in sydney for example they call them ratbags not in 
california 
among weeks subjects was bill steed who lives in emeryville 
across the bay bridge from san francisco and has toured the fair 
circuit with 40 hypnotized frogs and many laughs 
are we a little kooky asks steed look at it this way we

prime minister sousuke uno promised political 
reforms monday following a byelection loss by his liberal 
democratic party which has been shaken by scandal after nearly 35 
years in power 
uno also acknowledged that reports of his having kept a mistress 
had caused problems for his personal leadership of the party and 
government 
on sunday socialist party candidate kinuko ofuchi won a seat in 
parliaments upper house in the byelection in niigata northern 
japan a socialist had held the seat but the district traditionally 
has been conservative 
i never expected that we would lose so badly uno said monday 
press reports suggested voters were influenced by allegations 
that uno paid a geisha to be his mistress for four months in 1985 
at a news conference monday the prime minister said im not in a 
position to comment 
he said a new 3 percent sales tax the recruit influencebuying 
scandal and and farm issues were major factors in the loss at 
niigata 
uno has refused comment on the reports of a mistress calling it 
a private matter 
i have respected political ethics for 30 years and i have not 
done anything unethical he said monday but added i think it 
is regrettable that i caused trouble through personal matters 
a weekly magazine published the initial report about the geisha 
without naming her 
after the polls closed sunday night former geisha mitsuko 
nakanishi 40 said in a national television interview she was the 
woman she said uno paid more than 3 million yen about 21430 to 
her and her geisha house so she would be his mistress 
the case has tarnished the clean reputation that led to unos 
selection as prime minister a month ago 
his predecessor noboru takeshita resigned to take 
responsibility for the recruit scandal in which the information and 
publishing conglomerate is accused of trying to influence policy 
through bribes and bargainpriced stock shares 
prosecutors have charged four aides to senior politicians and 13 
businessmen bureaucrats and legislators in the case 
sundays election was watched as an advance indicator of voting 
next month for half the seats in the upper house 
mrs ofuchi the winner campaigned against the sales tax which 
took effect april 1 along with income tax cuts criticized unos 
party because of the recruit scandal and apparently won favor with 
rural voters oposed to opening japan to foreign farm products 
on monday uno said the liberal democrats intend to listen 
attentively to the peoples voices and will try to restore public 
confidence by making political reforms to prevent recurrences of 
the same wrongdoings 
his party now holds now holds 143 of the 251 seats in the upper 
house 
a telephone survey of 10000 people conducted june 1619 
indicated only 167 percent supported unos government the nihon 
keizai japans leading financial newspaper reported monday 
that was better than the 131 percent support rating for 
takeshita in march but the paper said 528 percent of those 
questioned opposed to unos government the remaining 305 percent 
expressed no opinion it said

baseballs lawyers today asked an appeals court 
to suspend a judges postponement of pete roses hearing before the 
commissioner of baseball saying the ruling threatens the very 
reputation of the game 
common pleas judge norbert a nadel on sunday delayed for at 
least two weeks a hearing today at which commissioner a bartlett 
giamatti was to consider allegations rose bet on ballgames nadel 
agreed with rose that giamatti had already made up his mind against 
the cincinnati reds manager and could not judge rose fairly 
in a request today for the suspension of nadels temporary 
restraining order baseball called the ruling unprecedented 
if every action of the commissioner to investigate and 
determine matters affecting the integrity of the game were to be 
subject to court intervention and delay the commissioners ability 
to safeguard the integrity of the game would be destroyed the 
request said 
the action of the court below threatens the very reputation of 
major league baseball and deprives the commissioner of the power to 
protect the integrity of the game 
a threejudge state appeals court panel will decide baseballs 
request after receiving a response from roses lawyers which is due 
wednesday morning 
rose could be banned from baseball for life if giamatti accepts 
evidence from a baseball investigator that rose bet on his own team 
robert pitcairn jr a lawyer for rose was said to be in a 
meeting this morning and was unavailable for comment 
nadel on sunday said the outcome of the baseball commissioners 
hearing was a foregone conclusion 
i think we got justice said roses attorney reuven katz 
im just pleased that we get the next opportunity rose said 
after his team lost 70 to los angeles obviously were pleased 
about this thats it next things next 
nadels ruling set a collision course with federal court 
decisions that have upheld the commissioners broad authority to act 
when the integrity of the game is at stake baseball team owners 
charles o finley and ted turner lost challenges of the authority of 
thencommissioner bowie kuhn in the 1970s 
the judge has made a mistake a big one baseball lawyer 
louis hoynes jr said sunday its an erroneous ruling its a 
problem a serious mistake 
giamatti said hell fight nadels decision tooth and nail 
i regret the judges decision i have absolutely no prejudgment 
or prejudice regarding pete rose giamatti said 
nadel who is up for reelection in 16 months agreed with roses 
lawyers that the commissioner had already made up his mind that rose 
is guilty of betting on baseball games 
the judge referred to a letter at the heart of roses case a 
recommendation sent by giamatti to a federal judge as part of the 
sentencing of bookmaker ronald peters 
the letter praised peters for being candid forthright and 
truthful with special baseball investigator john m dowd who 
found evidence that rose bet on reds games and other baseball games 
in 1985 1986 and 1987 
peters has told federal authorities who also are investigating 
rose that he accepted perhaps more than 1 million in bets on behalf 
of the manager for two years 
nadel held the letter up in court sunday as he announced his 
decision 
it therefore appears to this court at this point that the 
commissioner of baseball has prejudged peter edward rose nadel 
said we further find that the hearing set tomorrow in new york 
before the commissioner of baseball would be futile and illusory and 
the outcome a foregone conclusion 
nadel ruled that baseball cant take any action against rose for 
the 14 days the temporary restraining order is in effect he also 
ruled that rose cant be fired during that time 
the judge set arguments for a preliminary injunction for july 6 
if granted an injunction could indefinitely block the commissioner 
from deciding roses fate while the court takes over the case 
rose has sought just that getting a judge in his hometown 
rather than giamatti to determine the charges 
nadels ruling didnt touch on the question of whether rose bet 
on baseball rose has denied doing so but dowd testified before 
nadel last week that the manager admitted he had bet on other 
professional sports 
the reds manager was in his office behind a closed door while 
the decision was broadcast on television although he had little to 
say afterward several fans displayed banners of celebration at 
riverfront stadium and reds reliever rob dibble expressed full 
support 
bart giamatti knows nothing about baseball dibble said 
thats what happens when you give somebody power like that to use 
against pete rose

the foreman of the grand jury that investigated 
mary jo kopechnes death at chappaquiddick in 1969 said he was 
approached by two key lawmen who said an inquiry wasnt needed 
according to a published report 
newsweek reported in its july 3 issue that leslie leland a 
pharmacist on marthas vineyard said that the two men took him for 
a ride and told him their version of the nights events involving 
sen edward kennedy 
the bottom line was that this was nothing more than an accident 
and a minor vehicle violation and there was no need for the grand 
jury to get involved leland said 
there was a coverup all they were concerned about was 
protecting teddys political career it was like the hell with the 
fact that this young woman lost her life 
miss kopechne was killed when the car kennedy was driving across 
a bridge on the massachusetts island skidded into 8 feet of water 
he surfaced moments later miss kopechne died in the car 
the massachusetts democrat failed to report the accident for 10 
hours he received a suspended sentence for leaving the scene of an 
accident 
lelands dissatisfaction with the grand jury proceedings has been 
mentioned before most recently in the 1988 book senatorial 
privilege the chappaquiddick coverup by paul damore in it 
leland makes no mention of the ride but says he had a variety of 
meetings with officials and felt pressured not to ask certain 
questions 
in response to the newsweek article kennedys office issued a 
statement in which the senator again expressed remorse for the 
accident and said he takes full responsibility for the tragedy 
i have told everything i know about the accident i only wish 
that it were in my power to do something more to ease the continuing 
pain that i feel and that mr and mrs kopechne feel for mary jos 
loss the statement said 
press secretary paul donovan said there would be no further 
comment 
newsweek did not identify the lawmen or say when the meeting with 
leland occurred 
in the months that followed leland received three anonymous 
death threats and for a time was under 24hour police protection 
the magazine reported he nearly lost his pharmacy license when 
state officials did not send the usual renewal notice 
leland said that after he had convened the grand jury a 
prosecutor warned him to watch his step or the supervising judge 
might cite him for contempt the judge refused to let the grand jury 
subpoena witnesses or to review the record of the coroners inquest 
he said 
the grand jury finally gave up and when its term ran out the 
members were sworn to secrecy for the rest of their lives the 
magazine said newsweek didnt explain why leland decided to talk 
about the case now 
they tied us up leland said they had us handcuffed it 
was devastating there were two sets of rules one for the wealthy 
politician and the other for you and me

the sidewalks are hot enough to grill shrimp 
and one thing a tourist doesnt need in the nations capital right 
now is another line to stand in but guess what theyre doing in 
front of the supreme court these days 
lining up for the abortion decision next to the weather webster 
vs reproductive health services is the hottest thing in town 
word gets around fast the decision might come down today so 
crowds were out in force hours before the court opened the 
justices who know a showstopper when they get one teased the 
appetite with a handful of important rulings but they saved the big 
one for thursday which is probably the last day of the term 
one possibility that almost everyone discounted was that the 
justices might schedule new arguments at the outset of the next 
term which begins the first monday in october 
big events in washington often tend to become chaotic but not at 
the supreme court that temple of serenity 
in one corner of the marble plaza in front of the court 
television cameras were set up under beach umbrellas their 
satellite trucks parked nearby microphones were ready for the 
reporters inside who would rush out with the decision interrupting 
normal morning programming the lines of tourists snaked down the 
street 
experts were standing by cnn had a georgetown university law 
professor tom krattenmaker at the ready to lend his analysis of 
the abortion decision when the court instead issued two decisions 
about the death penalty he wound up talking about that 
nearby cbs also had a georgetown law expert paul rothstein 
demonstrators also were there ready to spring into action with 
their signs and chants 
inside the courtroom packed to capacity with reporters lawyers 
and a few lucky tourists the justiceauthors of mondays opinions 
read from them 
one floor below the court at the press office dozens of 
reporters were crowded in a small room waiting for the decisions to 
be handed out the court employees let the papers go to the waving 
hands as soon as they received a telephone call from within the 
court chamber that the decision had indeed been handed down 
tourists managed to get into that secluded part of the court 
building too since the agony of news people in the throes of 
reportage can make for an entertaining sight too but police kept 
the sightseers at bay 
the abortion ruling was not among mondays output and word 
flashed out no webster today 
demonstrators packed away their signs tv crews took down their 
cameras and tourists went whereever it is that tourists go showtime 
was postponed until at least thursday 
by 1025 am the no webster today call had been made and the 
street theater in front of the court dissolved a few tourists 
stayed around to see the courtroom now empty 
it was 85 degrees and climbing on the plaza outside but the 
weather service said the humidity made it feel like 95

a suspected poison was sprayed 
in a college chapel hours before a west german official met there 
monday with antiapartheid leaders a college official blamed 
rightwingers for the incident 
about 25 staff members at st barbabas college were treated for 
nasal irritation and west german labor minister norbert bluem got 
a good whiff of the foulsmelling substance said michael corke 
headmaster at the school in the johannesburg suburb of bosmont 
we suspect that rightwingers or other intolerant elements in 
our society were responsible for this vandalism said corke 
they are people who are anxious to disrupt the efforts of 
responsible groups working for social justice 
corke said there was an apparent connection between the spraying 
of the weedkiller believed to contain cyanide and allegations by 
the head of the south african council of churches of poisoning in an 
earlier incident 
the rev frank chikane the councils general secretary recently 
was hospitalized in the united states for the effects of poisoning 
which he said may have been applied to his luggage before he left 
south africa 
the south african press association quoted a police spokesman 
col frans malherbe as saying the incident was being investigated 
as malicious damage to property but if poison were found it would 
become an attempted murder investigation 
chikane returned to south africa last week to preside over the 
councils 21st national conference the church leaders met monday 
morning with bluem 
before bluems entourage arrived at the college corke said a 
toxic and highly noxious liquid had been sprayed over the chapel 
corke said an examination of the substance by the head of our 
science school suggests that it is a cyanidebased insecticide or 
weedkiller 
corke said one element of the spray was ethnoic acid which was 
mostly vinegar and another was possibly an insecticide 
corke said he believed the vandals had gained access to the 
college chapel after 730 pm sunday 
at his meeting with the church leaders bluem criticized the 
delay and suppression of court cases connected with the killings 
of antiapartheid activists and assured his hosts that the bonn 
government would not make any new investments in south africa 
but he said he was opposed to mandatory international economic 
sanctions which church council leaders say would pressure the 
government to end its apartheid laws 
under south africas system of racial segregation its 5 million 
whites control the economy and its 28 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs

syria must withdraw its troops from 
lebanon deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger said monday 
the syrians have to back off eagleburger said on 
christianowned voice of lebanon radio 
all of the outside parties ought to back off and let the 
lebanese make their own judgment about where their future lies 
there is too much foreign involvement on all sides he said in an 
interview recorded in washington 
his call for a syrian withdrawal indicated an apparent us 
policy shift but the state department said it was not so 
eagleburgers comments appeared to reverse his march 16 statement 
that syrian troops restrain warring parties in lebanon and that 
their withdrawal would worsen the situation he was speaking before 
the senate foreign affairs committee eight days into the current 
round of fighting 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
monday we have often called for the withdrawal of all foreign 
forces in lebanon 
the deputy secretarys remarks are entirely in keeping with 
us policy we believe and have often said the lebanese should be 
free to pursue a political process free of threats and coercion 
boucher said 
in mondays broadcast eagleburger said washington hopes 
lebanons 14year civil war can be resolved by an arab league 
committee comprising king hassan ii of morocco king fahd of saudi 
arabia and algerian president chadli bendjedid were obviously 
very hopeful that the arab committee can in fact bring sense to 
the situation and can convince the syrians to withdraw plus all 
those other foreign parties that have gotten themselves involved in 
the tragedy of lebanon eagleburger said 
an arab league summit gave the special committee six months to 
find a settlement in lebanon 
the three arab leaders are to meet tuesday in the algerian town 
of oran 
their mission was decided by a summit of the 22member 
organization after syria refused some members calls for it to 
withdraw from lebanon where it is the chief power broker lebanese 
christians backed by iraq damascus main arab foe charge syrian 
troops have violated a 1976 league peacekeeping mandate by siding 
with moslem militiamen in recent fighting 
a month after the summit the committee still has not been able 
to enforce a ceasefire between gen michel aouns mostly christian 
army of 20000 and 40000 syrian troops in lebanon 
the syrians on monday fired sporadic salvos of 130mm mortar 
shells to maintain their blockade of christian ports north of beirut 
and prevent iraqi supplies reaching aoun 
christian gunners retaliated with a barrage of 155mm howitzer 
shells on the seaside boulevard of moslem west beirut where several 
syrian batteries are deployed 
no casualities were reported 
by police count 373 people have been killed and 1460 wounded in

president bushs spokesman accused the oil 
industry monday of moving too slowly on oilspill cleanup technology 
and said three weekend spills highlight the pervasiveness of the 
problem 
but presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said that bush 
would not take any direct steps to respond to the weekend spills in 
rhode island delaware and texas 
the white house does not intend to assume an operational role 
in oil spills he said we think the coast guard is fully able 
and adequate to carry out these responsiblities 
fitzwater also ruled out a moratorium on new oil drilling and 
exploration 
we have to go ahead with exploration and development of natural 
resources we have to have petroleum products for meeting our energy 
needs he said 
fitzwater said a commanding aspect of the latest spills was 
to show the pervasiveness of the problem he said they 
underscored the need for legislation to better define tanker owners 
liabilities 
he cited legislation proposed by the administration on may 11 to 
give tanker owners first level of responsibility for paying 
cleanup costs 
under the administration bill tanker owners would be 
automatically liable for damages from 5 million to 78 million 
depending on the extent of the spill and the size of the ship 
a federal fund would be set up to pay cleanup costs over the 78 
million ceiling to be financed by a fee of 13 cents on every 
barrel of domestic as well as imported oil 
fitzwater said that the coast guard last year received reports of 
7500 oil spills 200 of which required a federal takeover of 
cleanup operations 
we feel the industry could do more both individual 
companies and the industry as a whole particularly in the area of 
research into better techniques for dealing with oil spills 
fitzwater said 
presumably we have had a lot of experience with oil spills we 
know that they are going to occur we have in place systems to deal 
with them but we also know from recent experience that there are 
problems that have to be corrected he added 
he said the most obvious shortcoming is the industrys 
research and development into better ways to disperse oil spills 
we also find that research has not produced dispersants the way 
it should that work is going forward the sense of urgency i 
believe is there in the congress and in the administration so 
theres no need to delay development of energy resources but there 
is a need to move quickly and effectively on better techniques in 
dealing with oil spills

romania is pulling down a wire fence it 
recently built on its border with hungary mti state news agency 
reported 
there was no word from romania on the fence which was criticized 
by the soviet union at a human rights conference last week in paris 
the barrier was erected along a 188mile section of the oroshaza 
district in southeastern hungary apparently to stop romanians from 
crossing into hungary illegally 
the wire curtain and the concrete pillars were almost 
completely removed from saturday to monday mti said monday 
hungarian foreign minister gyula horn on a visit to austria 
said monday i havent heard it yet but the news delights me 
horn called for romania to reestablish an autonomous region to 
safeguard ethnic and cultural rights of the 17 millionmember 
hungarian minority 
the situation is gradually deteriorating it is disastrous 
he said at a lecture on hungarian foreign policy but we havent 
given up hope for changes 
mti said the dismantling of the fence was announced by col janos 
pal commander of hungarian frontier guards in oroshaza 
during the first five months of this year 3231 romanians 
crossed illegally into hungary hungarian officials said 
about 30000 romanians most ethnic hungarians have fled to 
hungary in recent years seeking refuge from chronic hardships and 
discrimination under president nicolae ceausescu 
in a june 20 dispatch mti denied a western report that romania 
was building a wall along the border but said a wire fence 6 feet 
to 8 feet high was being erected and has been completed along 90 
percent of the border 
a subsequent mti report said romanian authorities had piled sand 
on roads leading to the border apparently to block traffic and 
border guards had noticed a kind of steel car trap 
mti said romania started building the fence 1 years ago but the 
pace of construction was speeded up in march 
romania came under bitter attack for flouting human rights of 
dissidents and ethnic minorities including hungarian magyars 
during the monthlong paris meeting 
even the soviet union criticized its ally 
the helsinki final act makes no mention of a barbed wall 
said chief soviet delegate yuri kashlev if we were the romanians 
we wouldnt have done it 
relations between hungary and romania have deteriorated as 
communist officials in budapest prepare to embrace mutliparty 
democracy and free elections next year ceausescus hardline 
government plans to raze thousands of villages including hundreds 
of ethnic hungarian communities to force assimilation 
recently romania has protested alleged antiromanian statements 
made during the june 16 public funeral of imre nagy the executed 
leader of the 1956 uprising

chengdu to look into the situation said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity

environmental experts said monday most of 
the estimated 420000 gallons of oil spilled into the ocean no 
longer threatened the shore and federal officials began a criminal 
investigation 
only a few small patches of oil could be seen in rhode island 
sound and along the states shoreline state and federal officials 
said 
the worst is over said debbie payton an oceanographer with 
the natonal oceanographic and atmospheric administration theres 
not going to be any more shoreline impacts like there were at the 
beginning im confident of that 
she estimated no more than 5 percent of the highly toxic oil 
spilled from the tanker world prodigy remained floating on the 
water the tanker loaded with nearly 8 million gallons went 
aground friday on brenton reef at the mouth of narragansett bay the 
coast guard estimated 420000 gallons spilled 
there had been some reports of lobsters killed and several small 
birds found dead but officials said those did not appear to be 
widespread 
my feeling is that people in rhode island scientists included 
are being maybe a bit upbeat warned william sargent director of 
the coastlines project at the woods hole oceanographic institute in 
massachusetts 
agents from the fbi and three other state and federal agencies 
met with justice department attorneys to begin their investigation 
into the accident said us attorney lincoln almond 
the problem that we have is that some of the information the 
coast guard has has been immunized and cannot be used by us 
almond said 
the coast guard has been gathering material for a joint 
investigation with the national transportation safety board that 
will open tuesday in providence said capt eric williams of the 
coast guards marine safety office 
because some of that information must be provided by law to the 
coast guard it cannot be used in a criminal investigation almond 
said among the statements in question was an admission by the 
ships greek master that he mistakenly brought the 533foot vessel 
into the harbor without a pilot 
criminal charges could be filed for negligent operation of a 
vessel or under the clean water or refuse acts almond said each is 
a misdemeanor with a maximum jail term of one year but the clean 
act violation could mean a fine of double the damages against the 
ships owner bollard shipping of athens greece almond said 
state beaches from jamestown almost to connecticut remained 
closed as a precaution although eastern beaches were open a 
statewide shellfishing ban remained in effect 
conditions were much much better than yesterday said 
stephen g morin state director of groundwater and wetlands after 
he and other officials flew over the area 
i havent seen it anywhere on the beaches weve flown today 
he said 
there was some problem with boaters who ignored requests to stay 
out of the area dragging oil along in their wake he said 
crews used booms and pads that can absorb up to 50 times their 
weight in oil to soak up the remaining contamination said michael 
annarummo deputy director of the state department of environmental 
management 
he said officials had not decided how to dispose of the pads 
which must be handled as hazardous waste 
coast guard capt eric williams said 72500 barrels of oil were 
left on the ship by midmorning of the 195000 barrels it had been 
carrying he estimated the removal would take a day or two more and 
said the ship would not be moved until it was empty

the supreme court ruled monday that 
skyrocketing punitive damage awards in personalinjury lawsuits 
dont violate the constitutions ban on excessive fines 
but the 72 ruling left open the possibility that dueprocess 
guarantees the constitutions assurance of fair play for all may 
be used to put a cap on the amount of money in such suits 
some justices practically invited a new appeal to resolve the 
dueprocess issue 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall in a 
concurring opinion said the ruling leaves the door open for a 
holding that the due process clause constrains the imposition of 
punitive damages 
some studies show punitive damages have soared in recent years 
one such study found that the average punitive damage award in 
personal injury cases in cook county ill was 14000 for a 
fiveyear period ending in 1969 and 19 million for a comparable 
period concluding in 1984 
industry spokesmen were disappointed with mondays ruling but 
hopeful they could win in the future 
were happy to see at least four justices interested in the due 
process challenge said quentin riegel a lawyer with the national 
association of manufacturers i expect a quick acceptance of a 
case with that issue perhaps later this week 
the court upheld a 6 million award a jury ordered a houston 
wastecollection company to pay a vermont competitor for trying to 
drive the new england company out of business 
writing for the court justice harry a blackmun said the 
constitutions eighth amendment prohibiting cruel and unusual 
punishment and excessive fines doesnt apply to civil lawsuits 
between private citizens or corporations 
the ban is designed to protect people against excessive 
punishment by the government generally in criminal prosecutions he 
said 
the fact that punitive damages are imposed through the aegis of 
courts and serve to advance governmental interests is insufficient 
to apply the excessive fines clause to a private suit blackmun said 
he relied in part on the us constitution and also on english 
common law dating to the 13th century when blackmun said 
awarding damages far in excess of actual compensation for 
quantifiable injuries was well recognized 
blackmun suggested the court might be willing to place a ceiling 
on such awards if it could be shown that runaway juries violated 
dueprocess standards 
justices sandra day oconnor and john paul stevens in a 
dissenting opinion said punitive damages may violate the 
constitutions ban on excessive fines 
business leaders have clashed for years with lawyers and consumer 
groups over the legitimacy of multimillion dollar awards in a wide 
range of lawsuits 
those who oppose the bigmoney awards say they are catastrophic 
for american competitiveness and development of new products 
particularly new forms of medical treatment 
they say juries capriciously penalize the wealthy to benefit 
those who have suffered injuries particularly if the victim is from 
nearby and the defendant is from another state or region 
consumer activists and trial lawyers say punitive damages are a 
powerful deterrent to corporate greed that poses a threat to public 
safety they say smaller compensatory awards may be viewed by large 
corporations as a cost of doing business 
some state legislatures reacting to soaring insurance rates 
have imposed ceilings on how much money can be recovered in 
personalinjury cases 
mondays case involved a 6 million punitive damage award against 
browningferris industries inc a wastecollection company based in 
houston with annual revenues exceeding 13 billion the company was 
ordered to pay the money to kelco disposal inc of burlington vt 
joseph kelley left browningferris to form kelco in 1980 and soon 
captured more than 40 percent of the market in the burlington area 
browningferris allegedly instructed its new burlington manager 
to put kelley out of business do whatever it takes squish him 
like a bug 
browningferris cut prices almost in half but failed to drive 
kelley out browningferris ultimately left the vermont market 
a vermont jury awarded kelco 51146 in compensatory damages and 
6 million in punitive damages

the halfpint juice box popular with children at 
snacktime tops the list of the best food science inventions in the 
last 50 years says a food technology group 
a panel on food safety and nutrition for the chicagobased 
institute of food technologists ranked better ways of canning 
vegetables second and the development of the microwave oven third 
the list was announced sunday 
the juice boxes are an example of aseptic packaging in which 
liquids are heated quickly to kill germs then cooled and placed 
into sterile airtight containers the juice or milk stays fresh 
even if the boxes are not kept cold 
among the other top innovations in the technologists list are 
frozen concentrated citrus juices freeze drying frozen meals food 
fortification and improved methods of sterilizing milk 
the group developed the list in connection with its 50th 
anniversary celebration this month 
these innovations have helped to ensure healthier eating while 
also reducing food bills significantly said fergus m clydesdale 
chairman of the panel that compiled the list and head of the food 
science department at the university of massachusetts 
clydesdale said life expectanty has increased so much since the 
last century partly because of the availability of more nutritious 
safer food 
we dont get the kinds of infections from food we used to he 
said that is because of the incredible sanitation that we didnt 
have before 
while canning food has been done for centuries it was included 
on the list because of a relatively new process used to can 
vegetables 
in the past food was placed in a can and heated clydesdale 
said often the food would be overheated not only killing 
bacteria but also knocking out nutrients

president bush on monday said archaic and 
unacceptable attitudes toward women help breed violent crimes 
against them and can rob them of full equality in american life 
this war against women must stop bush declared in an address 
to 2000 people at a convention of the american association of 
university women 
he said women can be victims not only of husbands abuse and 
street violence but also economic victims of a climate of fear 
that leaves them afraid to work late or walk to a library at night 
he said it was unthinkable that his seven granddaughters 
should not have the same opportunities in life as his four 
grandsons however he added 
no matter how equal the opportunities in our schools and 
workplace women will never have the same opportunities as men if a 
climate of fear leaves them justifiably concerned at walking to the 
campus library at night or reluctant to work late hours for fear of 
getting out of some parking lot safely 
he did not propose any specific new remedies to protect women 
but he said they would gain wider protection from the 12 billion 
anticrime package he sent congress june 15 
that initiative calls for building more federal prisons hiring 
more prosecutors and slapping tougher penalties on criminals who use 
firearms 
all too often violent crime also means crime against women 
said bush i am angered and disgusted by the crimes against 
american women and by the archaic and unacceptable attitudes that 
all too frequently contribute to those crimes 
whether it involves spouse abuse at home or violence in the 
street these are evil acts that transcend racial and class lines 
said bush 
he cited no examples but his words called to mind the recent 
rape of a jogger by a teen gang in new yorks central park as well 
as the murder of several women by their estranged husbands one on 
a furlough from an indiana prison 
marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said the 
presidents passion for this comes from his experiences like his 
discussions with drug enforcement administration agents in new 
york and his talks last thursday with runaway kids at the covenant 
house shelter in new york 
bush told the womens group those youths had spoken to him about 
drugs prostitution and hopelessness 
it was tragic and it brought home to me loud and clear how 
much we have left to do in terms of offering hope through 
education to the young people affected by this scourge of 
narcotics he said 
fundamentally violence against women wont subside unless 
public attitudes change we must continue to educate police and 
prosecutors judges and juries and we must engender a climate where 
the message our children get in television and films from schools 
and parents is that violence against women is wrong 
bush closed the speech quoting the 19th century frenchman alexis 
de tocqueville as saying the united states owed its singular 
prosperity and growing strength to the superiority of their 
women 
asked if that referred to their intelligence or looks fitzwater 
replied we better not try and interpret de tocqueville 
bush received an honorary membership in the 140000member 
organization 
technically that makes me the first aauw member to be president 
of the united states but i know i wont be the last he said 
the aauw founded in 1881 promotes equal opportunity and 
advancement for women and girls at all levels of education

a legislator monday suggested withdrawing the 
nations highest military order from leonid brezhnev the former 
soviet leader awarded the honor for his service in world war ii 
tass reported 
supreme soviet deputy albert likhachev said many people see the 
decoration as one of brezhnevs undeserved rewards tass however 
said the legislature was not empowered to revoke the award 
brezhnev rose to major general serving as a political officer in 
the war and got the jewelencrusted order of victory in 1978 33 
years after the war ended he died in 1982 
stripping him of the honor would further discredit the man now 
widely condemned for plunging the economy into crisis and stagnating 
the rest of soviet society his name has been stripped off cities 
and ships and his relatives have lost some of the benefits given 
family members of a soviet leader 
in recent years brezhnev has been satirized for all the medals 
he received many of which he awarded himself

rob lowes lawyer told a judge monday that the 
mother of a teenager lowe allegedly videotaped during a sexual 
encounter has no grounds to sue because the girl is not living with 
her mother 
the attorney also argued that the mother has suffered no direct 
harm from the tape which has been copied and widely circulated and 
shown in edited form on television 
the hearing before us district judge g ernest tidwell was on a 
motion by lowes attorneys to dismiss a lawsuit filed by lena arlene 
wilson the marietta woman who accused lowe of seducing her 
then16yearold daughter lena jan parsons during the democratic 
national convention in atlanta 
the suit which says lowe inflicted emotional harm on the mother 
seeks unspecified damages 
according to the lawsuit lowe made the sexually explicit tape in 
his hotel room while visiting atlanta for the political convention 
last july henry said the totality of conduct by mr lowe 
constitutes seduction 
the videotape shows a man believed to be lowe in a room with miss 
parsons and another woman it shows the teenager having sex with 
the woman with the man heard and seen giving directions but it 
does not show intercourse between the actor and miss parsons a 
different segment of the tape apparently taken at a different time 
shows the man having sex with others 
tidwell heard 40 minutes of arguments monday but did not indicate 
when he would rule 
lowe 25yearold star of such films as st elmos fire and 
about last night did not attend the hearing 
atlanta attorney edgar neely representing lowe told the judge 
that georgia law under which the suit was filed says only a 
custodial parent has the right to take legal action on a matter 
concerning a child 
miss parsons parents have divorced in the past year and her

taxpayers in this detroit suburb will 
pay an extra 16 million because the towns insurance company was 
four days late mailing a check to survivors of a man killed in a 
1982 police shooting 
circuit judge thomas foley doubled the 16 million award to the 
estate of benjamin davis 36 for the shooting which led to the 
1985 manslaughter conviction of officer michael killian 
police in nearby southgate began chasing davis after they saw him 
apparently commit a traffic violation killian joined the chase as 
it went through lincoln park and shot davis to death near davis 
home in detroit 
lincoln park a town of 45000 and californiabased mission 
national insurance co agreed to a 16 million settlement in the 
shooting 
the insurer paid 500000 on time in 1986 but was four days late 
with the remaining 11 million city attorney edward zelenak said 
the company is now bankrupt 
mayor robert heyer said he had no explanation for the late 
payment 
i would have been willing to get on a plane and go get the 
check if someone would have asked me to said heyer who was 
police chief at the time of the shooting we thought everything 
was taken care of 
after the state supreme court refused to hear an appeal of 
foleys decision foley made the award final may 19 to pay the 
award taxpayers are being assessed about 50 each this year and 
about 30 each next year 
city officials would like to get the extra 16 million from the 
insurers but since the company is bankrupt they dont have high 
hopes 
the bottom line is a deal is a deal the mayor said i 
think the average citizen will realize this is one of the costs we 
have to pay to provide law enforcement

the congressman who spurred an 
investigation into the death of a recruit last year at a navy 
training school said monday theres no sign that a second death 
there stemmed from similar problems 
after an extensive briefing by the chief of navy training rep 
toby roth rwis said he saw no evidence of failed safety 
procedures instructor abuse or a lack of emergency services in the 
death friday at the naval training center in pensacola fla 
a naval aviation officer candidate michael fedie 22 of 
altoona died friday in shallow water after a training exercise a 
preliminary autopsy showed abnormal brain swelling and further 
tests were under way 
in march 1988 airman lee mirecki 19 of appleton died during a 
different type of exercise 
it is really eerie that this should happen to another young 
sailor from wisconsin at the very same training facility said 
roth 
roth had ordered a congressional investigation into the death of 
mirecki a constituent after the young mans family raised 
questions about the navys explanation for the death 
in the mirecki case the general accounting office congress 
investigative arm found failures in safety procedures abuse of 
trainees by instructors and a lack of emergency services 
the probe led to reforms at the school and disciplinary action 
against a number of instructors and school administrators 
a pathologist concluded that mirecki had an abnormal fear of 
being pulled under water and died of heart failure and drowning when 
he was forced under water during training 
though fedie is not from roths district roth has looked into 
his death also he said he had an extensive discussion monday with 
adm john disher who is chief of navy training worldwide 
its clear as a bell the navy is handling this death in an 
entirely different way roth said in an interview in washington 
he said disher appears to be on top of the situation whereas 
last year we had a lot of stonewalling 
roth said fedie was wearing a uniform and normal gear when he 
jumped from the 12foot tower at the training pool for an 
abandonship exercise fedies father has described him as an 
excellent swimmer 
after fedie collapsed in shallow water as he was leaving the 
pool safety officers pulled him immediately from the water and 
began first aid an ambulance arrived within four minutes roth 
said and a doctor arrived shortly thereafter in a backup ambulance 
a preliminary autopsy saturday indicated fedie died from acute 
cerebral edema caused by an abnormal accumulation of fluid said kay 
esty a spokeswoman for the naval education and training command 
the navy has temporarily suspended the abandonship exercise 
fedie had just completed when he collapsed and died roth said

albertina sisulu the south african 
antiapartheid activist invited to visit by president bush said 
monday she favors additional international sanctions against her 
countrys white government 
mrs sisulu said she views the invitation by bush as a 
breakthrough that might portend a more active us role in bringing 
about negotiations between south africas black majority and its 
government he invited her last month after meeting with three other 
antiapartheid leaders visiting the united states 
mrs sisulu 71 whose family has come to symbolize the fight 
against racial segregation in south africa meets with bush and 
state department officials later this week this is the first time 
she has been allowed to leave south africa 
because she was invited by bush mrs sisulu told reporters she 
did not encounter difficulties getting a passport but the document 
only allows her to travel to the united states and is only valid for 
31 days she added 
mrs sisulu a nurse is one of three joint presidents of the 
united democratic front treasurer of the womens league of the 
outlawed african national congress and a founder of the federation 
of south african women her husband walter sisulu has been serving 
a life sentence since 1964 for being one of the founders of the anc 
along with its jailed leader nelson mandela 
two of mrs sisulus five children have fled into exile to avoid 
imprisonment and she served various jail terms and has been under 
house arrest and other government restrictions for 18 years 
mrs sisulu declined to say what she would tell bush but said 
that we would like the outside world to help us with comprehensive 
and mandatory sanctions in order to pressure the government 
president reagan imposed limited economic sanctions against south 
africa in 1986 after his veto was overriden by congress efforts by 
liberal democrats in congress to broaden the sanctions have so far 
failed 
bush while reluctant to support additional sanctions has 
endorsed a more active us role in bringing about negotiations to 
end the apartheid system of segregation and grant political rights 
to blacks 
secretary of state james a baker iii is scheduled to meet next 
month in washington with fw de klerk who is expected to assume 
his countrys presidency later this year and will be the first south 
african government leader on an official visit here in 30 years 
mrs sisulu said that despite his promise to enact political 
reform and end the domination of 28 million blacks by 5 million 
whites we see no change with de klerk his predecessor 
president pw botha made similar promises and failed to fulfill 
them she added 
de klerk should legalize the anc and return its leaders from 
exile so he can negotiate with them she said 
mrs sisulu praised former us ambassador edward perkins the 
first american black to hold that job saying he had helped obtain 
the release of south african children from jail we are sorry to 
lose him she said perkins returned here recently to head the 
foreign service

presidentelect carlos menem who 
has translated the radical slogans of his peronist campaign into 
conservative proposals in the face of economic chaos said monday he 
would fight for his program 
he appealed to the peronist party for support but said i am 
ready for an internal battle if necessary 
my political life has not been a bed of roses menem who is 
to take office july 8 said in an interview with radio mitre ive 
had to take roads full of rubble and thorns but when there is 
firmness capacity and a bit of audacity things turn out well 
the 58yearold provincial governor was elected may 14 with the 
support of organized labor and the working poor the peronists and 
their allies also won control of the legislature 
argentines expected a government that would spur employment 
continue the governments role in the economy and improve public 
services without raising their cost 
as a candidate menem promised huge pay increases and work 
work and more work he criticized increases in utility rates 
hinted at suspending payments on the 60 billion foreign debt and 
opposed efforts to sell inefficient stateowned companies to private 
investors 
as presidentelect he included three conservative nonperonists 
in his eightmember cabinet and picked an economic team that 
proposes large increases in utility rates partial sale of the state 
telephone and oil companies and a new currency 
an austerity program being devised to combat tripledigit 
inflation recession and a chronic budget deficit will be 
extremely hard he said last weekend 
menem was asked on friday how argentines could afford higher 
gasoline prices 
normally workers dont have their own cars he replied 
those who have cars and cant afford gas will have to put them 
away and buy a bicycle in china and other parts of the world 
they ride bikes its good for your health 
argentines were jolted by the statement they consider car 
ownership an achievable goal if no longer a right along with home 
ownership and annual vacations 
the peronist party and its backbone the 4 millionmember general 
labor confederation have accepted menems decisions so far but 
some party and union leaders are upset 
saul ubaldini the labor coalitions secretarygeneral organized 
13 general strikes against president raul alfonsin ubaldini 
rejected menems offer of foreign diplomatic post which was seen as 
an attempt to get the labor leader out of the way 
menem made the offer public and further undercut ubaldini by 
rejecting his demand that argentina halt payments on the foreign 
debt 
other clashes are possible on the minimum wage maintenance of 
collective bargaining agreements and the right to strike 
jorge triaca menems designated labor minister recently asked 
ubaldini for a pledge not to call a general strike for two years 
ubaldini refused 
when alfonsins government agreed last week to raise the monthly 
minimum wage by 130 percent to 20000 australs about 44 menems 
transition team expressed concern about where the money would come 
from 
alfonsins sixyear term ends dec 10 under the constitution but 
he said two weeks ago he would step down early because he could not 
stabilize the economy 
inflation was 785 percent in may and is almost certain to be 
higher for june monthly interest rates surpassed 200 percent last 
week 
construction in buenos aires has virtually halted auto 
electronics and other assembly lines have partially shut down 
hospitals and pharmacies are short on medical supplies and la 
serenisima one of the largest dairies has filed for bankruptcy 
no payments have been made on the foreign debt since last year 
and argentina is about 4 billion in arrears the central bank has 
only about 140 million in foreign reserves menem said and new 
loans from abroad are unlikely 
the budget deficit and unemployment are growing real wages have 
shrunk by at least 30 percent so far this year 
menem describes the argentina he will inherit as poisoned 
calamitous and chaotic and says he has fashioned a government of 
national unity to improve it 
those who criticized me most severely in the past now 
understand that they were wrong he said monday 
i hope my supporters who are now raising their voices finally 
understand that menem is not working just for the 6 million who 
voted for him but has to govern the 30 million citizens of 
argentina he declared

a decorated general charged with betraying 
the ideals of the cuban revolution by trafficking in cocaine ivory 
and diamonds appeared for a second day monday before a military 
honor tribunal 
the court of 47 topranking officers was expected to conclude 
monday with a recommendation for a courtmartial foreign ministry 
officials said on condition of anonymity 
they said the courtmartial of division gen arnalfo ochoa might 
begin as soon as tuesday 
the official cuban news agency prensa latina said ochoa 
admitted he was guilty of the charges sunday during the tribunals 
first session in a statement ochoa said he accepted 
responsibility for his actions the agency said 
defense minister gen raul castro brother of president fidel 
castro told the tribunal sunday that ochoas punishment should 
set an example 
some foreign ministry officials interpreted this to mean ochoa 
might face a firing squad but others speculated ochoa might be 
spared because of his decorated combat service his long friendship 
with gen castro and his rank one of the highest in the 
revolutionary armed forces 
ochoa is accused of being the ringleader of military and interior 
ministry officials who collaborated with the medellin cartel the 
worlds largest cocainesmuggling operation based in colombia he 
is also accused of smuggling ivory and diamonds 
gen castro accused ochoa of trying to build his own power base 
a clique beholdened by lavish gifts his comments were interpreted 
to mean that ochoa may have become a threat to the established order 
run by the castro brothers since the marxist revolution in 1959 
gen castro said that after ochoa returned from angola last year 
he began spreading lavish gifts around in a delirous exercise of 
selfcomplacency 
he said ochoa was trying to create an image and ties of 
personal gratitude with an absolute lack of principle and ethics 
the government has mounted an intensive public relations campaign 
against ochoa describing his alleged corruption in extraordinary 
detail in granma the official newspaper of the cuban communist 
party 
granma published the entire text of gen castros remarks to the 
tribunal on its front page on monday 
havana residents have mobbed news vendors since the scandal broke 
on thursday buying up every available copy of granma minutes after 
it hits the streets 
in a break from its usual reticence to report on internal 
affairs prensa latina has distributed extensive reports on the drug 
scandal 
cuban televison showed film from the closed tribunal on sunday 
night and government radio has run scores of interviews with 
soldiers and officers who professed outrage at ochoa for betraying 
the high moral stands of the revolution and the armed forces 
ochoa was decorated for his service as a field commander in 
angola in 1987 and 1988 and is one of only five officers ever 
awarded the hero of the republic of cuba 
gen castro on sunday told the tribunal that ochoas actions were 
a stab in the back to the fatherland

moslem guerrillas killed 1748 soldiers 
and wounded 3438 in five months the government said monday in its 
first detailed casualty report on the war since the soviet

civilians were killed and 3442 wounded during the period jan 20 
to june 21 he blamed the rebels for the civilian casulties 
afghan soldiers began taking over the fight against insurgents in 
january and the last of an estimated 115000 red army soldiers left 
feb 15 ending nine years of involvement in afghaistans civil war 
in islamabad pakistan a rebel spokesman said afghan rebels and 
soviet embassy officials agreed at talks monday that rebels held 
prisoner in kabul will be released in exchange for captured soviet 
soldiers 
but an official release from the embassy said final approval must 
come from the ruling marxists in kabul 
the spokesman said on condition of anonymity that both sides will 
exchange lists of prisoners at another round of talks to be held 
within the next week but he said the principle of a mass exchange 
demanded by insurgents at previous negotiation sessions was 
endorsed 
the guerrillas say 40000 rebels are missing in action no number 
was given for soviet prisoners 
local authorities in peshawar pakistan meanwhile said one 
person was killed monday and three people were seriously hurt when a 
mediumrange scud missile presumably fired from kabul hit 
pakistani territory less than a mile from the border 
more than 3 million afghan war refugees live in pakistan most of 
them in camps near the border 
when soviet military forces were in the country afghan soldiers 
joined them in military operations but rarely acted alone moslem 
insurgents began fighting after a coup in april 1978 and the soviets 
entered the war in december 1979 
amani said he did not have guerrilla casualties since jan 20 
but he said at least 12000 had been killed in the battle for 
jalalabad alone guerrillas began attacking the city march 6 
on monday amani said the government had effective control of 
jalalabad which 75 miles east of kabul and 45 miles from the 
border most of the guerrillas are based in pakistan and receive 
support from the united states 
according to amani the guerrillas fired more than 337000 
rockets and artillery shells in afghanistan during the period 
covered by the report including 136140 at jalalabad 
afghanistan refuses to reveal the size of the army but diplomats 
estimate it has about 80000 men 
amani also reported that photojournalist tony obrien of santa 
fe nm accused of entering the country illegally and held by 
afghan police was in good health and saw american news magazines on 
monday for the first time in 19 days 
he said that edward desmond new delhi bureau chief of time inc 
brought magazines and novels for the 42yearold freelance 
journalist who was on assignment for time inc 
amani said afghan troops captured obrien on june 8 not june 14 
as reported earlier in wardak province next to kabul he said 
obrien was found in rebel company 
police have yet to charge obrien nor have they allowed desmond 
or others to meet him 
afghan authorities say they are awaiting the arrival of a us 
diplomat from new delhi in the case they said he could not come to 
kabul on monday because of air transportation difficulties

the same pumps used to evacuate oil from the 
exxon valdez in alaska were clearing out the world prodigy off rhode 
island monday as the coast guard found itself dealing with four 
major oil spills 
officials said a response system that is under review as a result 
of the march 24 alaskan spill appears to be working well in handling 
smaller oil spills in rhode island delaware and texas 
no equipment or personnel had to be moved from alaska for the 
latest spills said david pascoe chief of the coast guards 
environmental response branch exxon is paying thousands of workers 
to clean up oil in the 10milliongallon alaskan spill 
in each of the latest spills local coast guard officials were 
overseeing the cleanup said pascoe 
but a strike force used in alaska and based in alabama was at 
work with its pumping equipment in rhode islands narragansett bay 
where the world prodigy ran aground friday and spilled 420000 
gallons of processed heating oil pascoe said the highvelocity 
pumps purged the exxon valdez of its remaining 40 million gallons of 
oil a few days after it ran aground in prince william sound 
the world prodigy retained about 6 million gallons which was 
being pumped into barges 
delaware national guardsmen and private contractor employees were 
scooping up blobs of oil from an estimated 800000gallon spill from 
a uraguayan tanker saturday in the delaware river but coast guard 
officials said shoreline damage downriver in delaware pennsylvania 
nd new jersey was almost nonexistent because the oil was thick and 
was not washing up on the shore 
in texas the coast guard was investigating a collision friday 
between the tanker rachelb and a barge owned by coastal towing co 
of houston most of the area affected by that spill was industrial 
pascoe said it was too early for the alaskan spill to have much 
impact on the way the coast guard or other agencies respond to 
spills but he noted that congress is considering several measures 
to deal with spills in the wake of the alaskan disaster and the oil 
industry last week announced its own plans for a coordinated 
response 
coast guard units throughout the country also are conducting a 
sixmonth review of their contingency plans for oil spills the 
review is to be completed in the fall 
pascoe said the fact the reviews are under way may have 
heightened the response of officials to the latest spills but he 
said there have been no policy or operational changes since the 
alaskan spill

more than 40 years after being found in the 
qumran caves many of the dead sea scrolls remain a mystery largely 
because the few scholars with exclusive access have failed to make 
their findings public 
other scholars are clamoring to have a look and israeli 
authorities have laid down a deadline of 1996 to see all the 
documents in print 
its true that scholars have been dragging their feet for the 
past 40 years its an absolute scandal said magen broshi 
curator of the shrine of the book where about eight of the 800 
scrolls are on permanent display 
the bimonthly biblical archaeology review published in 
washington has carried two articles questioning the delays and 
saying scholars were unfairly blocked from access to both the 
original manuscripts and photographs 
editor hershel shanks wrote that the team of scholars originally 
given exclusive rights to research by king hussein of jordan and 
later by the government of israel has now become more an obstacle 
to publication than a source of information 
shanks called for opening the materials to research by any 
scholar who so wishes 
one angry scholar is robert eisenman professor of religion at 
california state university in long beach he said he was denied 
permission to conduct carbon14 dating tests on the scrolls and was 
barred from looking for a bible passage in isaiah that he needed to 
support a theory 
manuscripts of crucial importance are jealously guarded by 
small group of scholars eisenman said in a telephone interview 
we have research to do and we are tried of waiting and want to 
know whats in the scrolls in our lifetime 
john strugnell a professor at havard universitys divinity 
school and the new editorinchief of the scroll project that 
involves about 20 scholars said he tries to accommodate as many 
outside requests as possible 
my general inclination is to facilitate requests but my 
problem is to get the scrolls published not satisfy the vanities of 
particular scholars said strugnell who is based in a chamber in 
a church at the frenchrun ecole biblique in jerusalem 
strugnell who predicted the scroll project would be completed by 
the end of the century noted a series of greek papyri found in 
egypt 100 years ago was still not fully published 
he demonstrated the difficulty of the work by displaying a 
photograph of a stillundeciphered manuscript in which tiny 
fragments of hebrew letters dotted the plate 
maybe the one big mistake was deciding in the beginning to 
publish every detail he said 
shanks said the 1996 target date set by israels department of 
antiquities was a hoax and a fraud because it did not say what 
would happen if scholars failed to meet deadlines 
but amir drori the antiquities chief and a former army general 
said he set up a program to require annual progress reports and got 
the scholars to agree on publishing all their finds in seven years 
he said fewer than half of the scrolls had been published 
to speed the process drori said scholars had been urged to 
share the workload with students and other researchers and a 
special study program has been set up by hebrew university for 
leading bible scholars next fall a 350000 grant from an offshoot 
of the wolfson foundation has also been obtained 
for the first time we have a plan and if someone does not 
complete his work on time we have the right to deliver the scrolls 
to someone else said drori the former commander of troops in 
lebanon during israels 198285 invasion 
drori defended the decision to close the doors to some scholars 
saying free access was unfair to those who have devoted their 
life to the research 
drori was interviewed at his office in the rockefeller museum 
where the leather parchment manuscripts are kept in airconditioned 
aluminum boxes in the cellar 
the review said some scroll fragments are deteriorating so 
rapidly that if the outside world cannot see them soon it may never 
be able to see them 
broshi who oversees conservation dismissed the allegation as 
absolute rubbish adding that only about 1 percent of the 
manuscript collection had deteriorated beyond repair other scholars 
with access to the scrolls put the figure as high as 5 percent but 
said the care is good 
discovered by bedouin nomads in the caves overlooking the dead 
sea in 1947 excavations uncoverd the documents from 11 caves in a 
10year span 
the scrolls include some of the earliest copies of the books of 
the bible as well as poetry and legal texts scholars say they 
provide an insight into the life of the ancient essene sect of jews 
as well as the roots of christianity 
the dead sea scrolls provide a missing link between christian 
and judaism they help us understand how jesus arrived at some of 
the teachings he preached certainly there is a similarity between 
his teachings and this sect said rudolph cohen deputy director 
of the rockefeller museum

opponents called mondays supreme court 
decisions upholding the death penalty for retarded killers and some 
teenage murderers appalling and tragic but law enforcement 
officials hailed the rulings as a victory in the fight against 
violent crime 
it is quite appalling that the supreme court would read the 
constitution as not banning the execution of children said 
henry schwarzschild of the american civil liberties union 
to let society hang children is medieval and barbaric 
however kentucky attorney general fred cowan said he found the 
decisions on juvenile killers gratifying 
in an era of growing concern over the increase and seriousness 
of violent crime the courts decision reaffirms that state 
legislators the juvenile justice system and local juries not the 
federal courts can and should decide upon the proper age to impose 
the death penalty cowan said 
clearly some 16 and 17yearolds in our society are fully 
mature and capable of plotting and carrying out the most heinous of 
crimes he said the court has obviously responded to societys 
demand to hold youths who are mature enough to commit horrible 
crimes responsible for their actions 
the court said the constitutions ban on cruel and unusual 
punishment does not prohibit the death penalty for murderers as 
young as 16 or for retarded adults with the reasoning capacity of 
young children 
the court upheld the death sentences of a kentucky murderer who 
was 17 when he killed and a missouri killer who was 16 as well as a 
texas killer who has the mental capacity of a 7yearold 
it now falls to state legislatures to assure that no individual 
with this disability is ever put to death in this country said 
james ellis president of the american association on mental 
retardation the execution of any such person would represent a 
tragic injustice 
schwarzschild said the execution of people who are not fully 
responsible for their acts is an atrocity 
american bar association president robert raven said his 
organization was gravely concerned about the courts decision on 
juvenile killers 
to give up with ultimate finality upon a person even before 
they emerge from childhood is squarely in opposition to the 
fundamental premises of an enlightened juvenile justice system 
raven said 
but missouri attorney general william webster whose office 
successfully argued in favor of letting states impose the death 
penalty on murderers who committed their crimes while 16 or 17 took 
issue with such concerns 
i think thats hogwash webster said theres a lot of 
people that say its going to open the door thats ludicrous

president bush told five dozen exdemocrats at 
a party monday for new republican officials that the switch is 
on to the gop while the democratic party is moving to the left 
and out of the mainstream 
the officials got handshakes from bush duly recorded by a white 
house photographer as part of a celebration that lee atwater the 
gop chairman called his proudest single moment in office 
bush looked at the state legislators aldermen judges sheriffs 
and other officeholders who had crossed political lines and 
pronounced himself well pleased 
the switch is on to the party in sync with the american 
principles said bush the switch is on to the republican 
party 
on this sweltering afternoon bush was having none of the 
bipartisanship the extended hand that he so often stresses in 
dealings with the democraticcontrolled congress 
it was back to the hardhitting antiliberalism he successfully 
hammered democratic presidential nominee michael s dukakis with in 
last years campaign 
people say the republican party is on the move thats 
true were moving in the right direction but the democratic party 
is on the move too to the left and out of the mainstream bush 
said 
he quoted the greatest former democrat of them all ronald 
reagan who has said that i didnt leave the democratic party the 
democratic party left me 
rep bill grant of florida the congressman who announced his 
switch to the gop at the white house in february told the others 
you didnt come here because it was an easy road i know you went 
through period of great selfdoubt ambivalence even before you 
changed your party registration 
youre tough he said youre being accused of being a 
traitor turncoat accused of betraying the voters by leaving the 
democratic party he added 
atwater said that this is a great day for our party weve had 
118 elected officials and party officials switch from the democratic 
party to our party since my chairmanship began while i know of 
no single example of a republican party official or elected official 
who has switched the other way 
all but a handful of the switchers were from the south and most 
made their move this spring 
charles evers outgoing longtime mayor of fayette miss and 
brother of civil rights martyr medgar evers said he switched 
because i dont like to be with losers the democratic party is a 
loser and it took us for granted

unita rebel leader jonas savimbi appeared 
before thousands of cheering supporters monday and said the 
ceasefire is holding in the civil war and that more peace talks are 
planned this week 
savimbi said at his bush headquarters in southeastern angola that 
he believes a national unity government can be established by the 
end of the year although he set no firm date 
i am confident the negotiations will bear fruit he said of 
talks planned this week in kinshasa zaire between the 
westernbacked unita guerrilla movement and the marxist government 
of angola 
the angolan people want peace and the unita delegation is 
prepared to be flexible he said 
savimbi denied reports that he consented to go into foreign 
exile he said he will remain in his homeland as leader of the 
national union for the total independence of angola known by its 
portuguese acronym unita 
a person goes into exile after hes been defeated he said 
i plan to stay right here 
thousands of rebel soldiers and civilian supporters sang danced 
and waved redandgreen paper replicas of the guerrilla flag at a 
parade to celebrate the ceasefire declared thursday at a 20nation 
african summit in gbadolite zaire 
the spirit of the ceasefire can be considered as holding 
savimbi said he said isolated skirmishes could break out due to the 
difficulty of contacting all combatants but he said he thinks the 
truce will last 
the summit was the first meeting between savimbi and president 
jose eduardo dos santos since the battle for power broke out in 1975 
shortly after angola gained independence from portugal 
the guerrilla movement controls areas in southeastern angola 
occupied by up to 3 million of the countrys 9 million people 
savimbi and dos santos sealed the accord with a handshake and 
agreed to more talks 
since the handshake angola radio has referred to savimbi as 
unita president rather than its previous description of him as 
a traitor and bandit leader 
savimbi meanwhile said the rebel radio now refers to dos santos 
as president rather than caudillo the portuguese word for 
tyrant or dictator 
savimbi praised dos santos for his bravery in agreeing to the 
talks with unita i want president dos santos to succeed 
savimbi said i know he needs time 
savimbi said he expected talks between the two sides in zaire and 
possibly another african summit to review the process in august or 
september 
the angolan government said during the weekend that the 
ceasefire was holding 
unitas chief of intelligence gen wambu chindondo said the 
rebels declared a halt to offensives in february and that the 
guerrilla movement had no difficulty abiding by the ceasefire he 
said the combined angolancuban forces appeared to be preparing for 
attacks but there were no major battles in recent weeks 
the angolan civil war has claimed tens of thousands of lives and 
involved several foreign governments including the united states 
the soviet union south africa and cuba 
in a dispatch from luanda the portuguese news agency lusa quoted 
unidentified diplomatic and military sources as saying the united 
states pressured savimbi to attend the gbadolite summit and accept 
the angolan peace plan 
according to lusa the sources said savimbi at first refused 
because of internal discord within unita zaire president mobutu 
sese seko was obliged to contact washington and pretoria in order 
to ensure the success of the summit 
the ceasefire follows usbrokered regional peace accords 
angola signed in new york in december with cuba and south africa 
under the accords south africa agreed to allow angolas southern 
neighbor namibia independence under a un plan and halt aid to 
savimbis guerrillas in exchange cuba agreed to a phased 
withdrawal of its estimated 50000 troops backing dos santos 
government unita was not party to the agreement

rezsoe nyers said monday he and the 
other three members of the communist partys new collective 
leadership will work together for unambiguous reform 
nyers the new party chairman said the four leaders chosen over 
the weekend have equal responsibility but in matters of party 
policy he is first among equals 
creation of the fourman presidium by the central committee 
appears to strengthen the reform wing and limit the power of karoly 
grosz the party general secretary who also is a member 
grosz who replaced longtime party chief janos kadar 13 months 
ago has resisted numerous demands from reformers that he resign 
also on the new leadership team are imre pozsgay the partys 
leading reformer and reformminded premier miklos nemeth 
nyers pozsgay and nemeth insisted at a news conference monday 
that each of the four had equal power 
it is not a mathematical formula of three plus one nyers 
said in a clear reference to the reformers and grosz it is not a 
question of where weve been but where we are going the party 
wishes to become a more unambiguous reform party 
he said the party had chosen to dissociate itself from 
extremes 
pozsgay said a real compromise was achieved the important 
matter is the unity of views and not the differences 
he said peaceful transition to democratic socialism and a 
multiparty system should not lead to a power vacuum 
a country should not run loose pozsgay declared it is 
important to govern 
prominent members have expressed concern that a split might cause 
the party to disintegrate pozsgay has said repeatedly that none of 
the political groups springing up in hungary is ready to assume 
power 
nemeth said it would be wrong to define unity by the former 
criteria under which the leadership presented a unifed platform 
everyone is a boss in some way in the new presidium he said 
as nyers explained it grosz would be responsible for the entire 
party apparatus and nyers the chairman would handle the partys 
domestic and foreign relations 
pozsgay has been proposed as the party candidate for president of 
hungary when the post is created the new presidency would have far 
greater powers than the current ceremonial office 
in the new leadership everyone supports reform grosz told 
the news conference with debate centering on the type of reform and 
the pace at which it should occur

soviet dissident andrei d sakharov said 
monday that trimming the soviet military and halving enlisted mens 
service time would have a colossal effect for world disarmament 
sakharov said the number of soviet army officers should be 
reduced at a slower rate with the view of setting up an 
allprofessional army 
he told reporters at the nobel institute that arms reduction 
should be moscows major foreign policy priority 
the institute is home of the committee that awarded him the 1975 
nobel peace prize sakharov 68 arrived from london on sunday for 
his first visit here since winning the prize for his human rights 
activities 
sakharov said the soviets were being pragmatic in their 
guarded response to the beijing governments crushing of the chinese 
democracy movement and the death sentences for chinese students 
he pulled a paper from his pocket that he said was a telegram he 
sent to world leaders it said now is not the time for cautious 
pragmatic reactions 
sakharov said that despite the kremlins removal of its last 
troops in afghanistan in february the soviet union still has 
considerable influence in afghanistan and ought to reduce it 
he spent eight years in internal exile in gorky for attacking the 
mass soviet military intervention in afghanistan in late 1979 
sakharov a renowed physicist who helped develop soviet nuclear 
capability said he favors continued use of nuclear energy but 
recommended that power plants be built underground 
sakharov and his wife yelena bonner were invited by the 
oslobased norwegian research council for science and the 
humanities the nobel committee and michelsen institute for science 
and intellectual freedom in bergen 
soviet authorities would not let him come to oslo to accept the 
1975 nobel prize and ms bonner received it on his behalf 
she came home full of warm feelings for norway now im 
extremely happy to be in this house which has so often been in my 
thoughts sahkarov said 
he is to meet prime minister gro harlem brundtland and foreign 
minister thorvald stoltenberg he also will address scientists 
visit research institutes and attend a human rights seminar 
the sakharovs earlier visited the netherlands and britain and 
will proceed to switzerland from norway

here is a text of former speaker jim wrights 
statement on his decision to resign his house seat effective friday 
and not seek reelection 
since announcing that i would retire from the house of 
representatives at the end of this month i have received thousands 
of written and verbal requests from people in my district imploring 
me to reconsider 
some have spoken of writing my name in on the special election 
ballot and some others even have begun circulating petitions to 
place my name on the ballot 
naturally i have been moved by such gracious and spontaneous 
expressions of support i did not encourage these entreaties but 
out of profound respect and affection for the wonderful people who 
have been coming to me i did not peremptorily dismiss their ideas 
i heard them out 
as deeply as i appreciate the devoted friendship which impels 
these sincere petitions i must conclude that i was right in 
announcing my retirement from congress 
independent polling data have made it very clear that i could be 
reelected these demonstrations of strong bipartisan support are 
truly gratifying but i feel that i probably have done as much good 
as i can do in congress at the present time and should look to the 
next phase of my life 
it is best for the institution and best for the people whom ive 
served that i step aside now and make room for others 
thirtyfour and a half years is a very long time and i have been 
richly blessed 
to seek and gain the splendid honor of a public endorsement one 
more time would be vainglorious to do so without intending to serve 
for a prolonged period would be pointless 
to postpone the moment when another may begin would be a 
disservice 
i do not foreclose the possibility that at some future time and 
some other way i may again be of service to our nation but not in 
elective office 
as for now betty and i are ready to enjoy a period of private 
life i will not be inactive but i hope to be selective and pursue 
a slightly less hectic pace than at present i have received perhaps 
65 or 70 speaking invitations for example and have accepted five 
or six i am also considering some limited business and professional 
relationships and some invitations to write i will have an office 
in fort worth 
if i should live to be 100 i shall never cease to be grateful to 
the people of my area and to my colleagues in congress who have made 
it possible for me to do whatever good ive been able to do for our 
country and to have the joy of doing it

the justice minister monday said israel should 
deport more palestinians to help crush the revolt in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
dan meridors suggestion is among tougher measures to handle the 
18month uprising proposed by israeli officials and criticized by 
the united states and human rights organizations 
i think deportation is serious but must be used i would say 
perhaps even more that what has been done until now meridor told 
army radio 
i think its an effective punishment when we have appropriate 
evidence he said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin has recommended speeding up 
deportation procedures as well as demolishing more homes of 
palestinians suspected of antiisraeli activities and lengthening 
the term security suspects can be detained without trial from six 
months to one year 
washington and human rights organizations say all three methods 
ignore international conventions on the treatment of people in 
occupied lands and violate due process of law because suspects have 
no chance to go to court 
the justice and defense ministries sunday set up a joint 
committee to devise tougher measures to put down the uprising 
meridor told the radio about 50 palestinians have been deported 
since the start of the uprising and nearly 300 houses have been 
demolished or sealed 
also monday the body of a woman suspected of cooperating with 
israeli authorities was found in the west bank city of nablus arab 
reports said she had been beaten to death they said 
palestinians said sabah khadi kanaan 30 had been accused of 
collaborating with israels secret police but an army spokesman 
said police believe the killing was criminal 
ms kanaan was the 68th suspected collaborator killed by 
palestinians since the uprising began in december 1987 the unrest 
has killed 536 palestinians and 23 israelis 
a suspected collaborator killed sunday initially was identified 
by arab reporters as nidal salhab 21 but police monday said 
salhabs father reported his son was alive the victims head had 
been crushed and police said they still are trying to determine his 
identity 
meanwhile sen daniel inouye dhawaii said israel must present 
a united front on its peace plan 
though it may be difficult and painful israel must declare and 
demonstrate to one and all friendly and unfriendly that she is not 
divided and that her mission of peace is sincere and real inouye 
said speaking at a hebrew university graduation ceremony 
prime minister yitzhak shamir has proposed holding elections in 
the occupied lands to select palestinian representatives to open 
negotiations on an interim peace agreement with israel 
hardliners in his rightwing likud bloc oppose the plan saying 
it could lead to formation of a palestinian state 
inouye also said the united states should stand behind israel 
this is a time of testing for america and israel testing 
whether we are prepared to take this important step in the pathways 
of peace and we must not fail inouye said

fransie geringer enjoyed himself monday but 
at age 16 he knows he may not make it to the next annual reunion of 
victims of progeria the fatal syndrome that turns children old 
before their time 
the shrunken pinchfaced south african one of the 16 known 
victims of the condition praised the reunions in a soft shy voice 
as he visited sea world marine park 
i get to my see my friends said geringer who suffered a 
series of heart attacks in recent months and had to drop out of 
school it may be the last time 
progeria sufferers and their families from argentina australia 
canada england the netherlands south africa and the united states 
are enjoying themselves at sea world walt disney world and a nearby 
ranch 
the reunion for the youngsters who range in age from 4 to 19 
began june 23 and runs through friday 
progeria with a reported incidence of up to 1 in 8 million 
births is characterized by what appears to be rapid aging 
dwarfism baldness and distortion of joints and faces most 
sufferers die before they turn 20 the cause is unknown 
geringers journey from brakpan south africa to californias 
disneyland in 1981 and his meeting there with three other victims of 
the genetic syndrome made the world aware of the syndrome 
two of the other three have died but mickey hays 17 faces his 
plight with bravado saying hes a tough little texan whos like 
anyone else 
theres nothing wrong with me said the longview texas 
teenager i do what i like fishing working on a race car with 
my friend i left school in the eighth grade dont need it 
the gatherings have been sponsored since 1982 by the 
philadelphiabased sunshine foundation which grants the wishes of 
terminally ill children 
the number of progeria sufferers has remained about 16 for 
several years said bill sample the former philadelphia police 
officer who founded the organization 
about the time we add one we lose one said sample 
this reunion is critically important to the kids the parents 
especially but to the medical community too sample said 
the annual gatherings may eventually lead to treatment even 
prevention if researchers succeed in isolating the genetic 
breakdown that causes the problem said drs ted brown and frank 
debusk who have been studying progeria for the past eight years 
it has not been possible for any one doctor to see more than 
one or two of these children at one time anywhere in the world 
said brown doctor debusk and i have been fortunate in having 
reunions such as this 
brown a geneticist at cornell medical school who began studying 
progeria in 1974 said he believes its caused by a cell defect that 
prevents normal absorption and elimination of a substance called 
hyaluronic acid from the body he believes he can prove his theory 
in about two years 
debusk who is with the university of floridas pediatrics 
department estimated there have been about 100 cases of progeria in 
the world since it was first reported in 1866 some researchers say 
it appears in one out of 8 million births others say one in 4 
million 
some cases are not reported and some are not properly identified 
before the victims die some victims parents deny their children 
have it debusk said 
im sure there have to be many others he said

here are excerpts from mondays supreme court 
decisions upholding the death penalty for convicted murderers as 
young as 16 and for mentally retarded killers 
from justice antonin scalias majority opinion in the 
juvenilekillers cases 
petitioners are correct in asserting that this court has not 
confined the prohibition embodied in the eight amendment banning 
cruel and unusual punishment to barbarous methods that were 
generally outlawed in the 18th century but instead has interpreted 
the amendment in a flexible and dynamic manner 
in determining what standards have evolved however we have 
looked not to our own conceptions of decency but to those of modern 
american society as a whole we emphasize that it is american 
conceptions of decency that are dispositive rejecting the 
contention of petitioners and their various amici organizations 
filing friendofthecourt briefs that the sentencing practices of 
other countries are relevant 
first among the objective indicia that reflect the public 
attitude toward a given sanction are statutes passed by societys 
elected representatives of the 37 states whose laws permit capital 
punishment 15 decline to impose it upon 16yearold offenders and 
12 decline to impose it on 17yearold offenders 
this does not establish the degree of national consensus this 
court has previously thought sufficient to label a particular 
punishment cruel and unusual 
from justice sandra day oconnors concurring opinion 
it is sufficiently clear that no national consensus forbids the 
imposition of capital punishment on 16 or 17yearold capital 
murderers 
i am unable however to join the remainder of scalias opinion 
which in part emphatically rejects the suggestion that beyond an 
assessment of the specific enactments of american legislatures 
there remains a constitutional obligation imposed upon this court to 
judge whether the nexus between the punishment imposed and the 
defendants blameworthiness is proportional in my view this court 
does have a constitutional obligation to conduct proportional 
analysis 
from justice william j brennans dissenting opinion 
i believe that to take the life of a person as punishment for a 
crime committed when below the age of 18 is cruel and unusual and 
hence is prohibited by the eighth amendment 
together the rejection of the death penalty for juveniles by a 
majority of the states the rarity of the sentence for juveniles 
the decisions of respected organizations in relevant fields that 
this punishment is unacceptable and its rejection generally 
throughout the world provide to my mind a strong grounding for the 
view that it is not constitutionally tolerable that certain states 
persist in authorizing the execution of adolescent offenders 
from oconnors controlling opinion in the death penalty for 
retarded killers ruling 
mental retardation is a factor that may well lessen a defendants 
culpability for a capital offense but we cannot conclude today that 
the eighth amendment precludes the execution of any mentally 
retarded person of johnny paul penrys ability convicted of a 
capital offense simply by virtue of their mental retardation alone 
so long as sentencers can consider and give effect to mitigating 
evidence of mental retardation in imposing sentence an 
individualized determination of whether death is the appropriate 
punishment can be made in each particular case 
while a national consensus against execution of the mentally 
retarded may someday emerge reflecting the evolving standards of 
decency that mark the progress of a maturing society there is 
insufficient evidence of such a consensus today 
from brennans opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part 
i agree that the jury instructions given at sentencing in this 
case deprived petitioner of his constitutional right to have a jury 
consider all mitigating evidence that he presented before sentencing 
him to die i would also hold however that the eighth amendment 
prohibits the execution of offenders who are mentally retarded and 
who thus lack the full degree of responsibility for their crimes 
that is a predicate for the constitutional imposition of the death 
penalty 
from justice john paul stevens opinion concurring in part and 
dissenting in part 
justice scalias opinion adequately and fairly states the 
competing arguments respecting capital punishment of mentally 
retarded persons in my judgment however that explication 
particularly the summary of the american association on mental 
retardation and other amici curiae friends of the court compels 
the conclusion that such executions are unconstitutional 
from scalias opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part 
in holding that the jury had to be free to deem penrys mental 
retardation and sad childhood relevant for whatever purpose it 
wished the court has come full circle not only permitting but 
requiring what the court once condemned freakishly and 
wantonly have been rebaptized reasoned moral response

the chicago mercantile exchange and other 
futures markets should do a better job of cracking down on 
highpressure telephone sales tactics at member firms the staff of 
the commodity futures trading commission said monday 
the staff report praised the exchange for responding to earlier 
suggestions for improvement but said more needs to be done to 
ensure that investigative procedures adequately address the issue 
of detecting abusive oral sales representations 
one of the biggest complaints of securities and futures customers 
after the october 1987 stock market crash was that they had been 
talked into making unsuitably speculative investments without being 
properly warned of the risks 
the staff of the commission which regulates futures markets 
praised the merc for starting a program of interviewing customers to 
make sure futures brokers dont use sale pitches designed to 
override risk disclosure documents provided to customers however 
it said the exchange should routinely conduct the interviews in a 
more systematic and timely fashion 
specifically the commission staff said the merc did a poor job 
of investigating a particular firm which it did not identify that 
had attracted an unusual number of customer complaints 
the cftc division of trading and markets believes that the 
exchanges investigation was not concluded in a timely manner 
and should have included certain additional procedures such as an 
attempt to uncover high pressure sales tactics the agencys 
report said 
it also said that the exchanges requirement that most actions by 
staff investigators be authorized by an internal committee may 
unnecessarily prolong an investigation 
andrew a yemma a spokesman for the exchange said the merc 
disagreed with the commissions assessment of that particular 
investigation 
we believe our efforts were timely and thorough and we will 
attempt to bridge this gap with the cftc he said 
however he said the exchange intends to adopt a commission 
suggestion that it work more closely with the national futures 
association and will adopt an invesigatory technique used by the 
association the association sometimes has its investigators pose as 
customers as a way of uncovering sales abuses 
in another recommendation the commission said the mercs member 
firms should do a better job of supervising sales personnel who were 
hired away from other firms that got into trouble with regulators 
members of the mercantile and of other exchanges as well have 
employed and in some cases even recruited employees of firms 
subject to commission enforcement proceedings or disciplinary 
actions for sales violations the report said 
yemma said the mercantile would adopt the recommended procedures 
for monitoring such employees 
in general he said the merc believes the commission report was 
favorable for instance it praises the exchange for more than 
doubling its audit staff from 16 in may 1985 to 35 in january 1988 
futures markets regulation has become a particular focus of 
congress since the disclosure in february that the fbi had conducted 
a twoyear undercover investigation of alleged abuses members of 
congress are questioning whether futures exchanges selfregulation 
system is working and whether the commission is providing effective 
oversight of the system 
the legislative scrutiny will likely come to a head this fall 
because congress must reauthorize the commission before sept 30 or 
the agency will go out of business

forecasters predicting as much as 15 inches of rain in the next 24 
hours

some areas of brazoria county had received more than 10 inches of 
rain in the previous couple of days and that amount also was 
expected for parts of houston weather service meteorologist ernest 
chapa said 
it should weaken after it goes ashore but itll take a 
while chapa said

sending a benzenebearing barge aground in the houston ship channel 
three people escaped serious injury and the barge was not believed 
to be damaged coast guard spokesman mark kennedy said 
it may be able to ride out the storm aground kennedy said 
these are fairly soft and sandy bars and reefs so maybe it wont 
be a problem 
tides ranged from 3 to 5 feet above normal chapa said 
in galveston the rain and high tides pushed highland bayou out 
of its banks along a highway submerging cars in more than 4 feet of 
water

most of the day with ernest kucza head of the foreign affairs 
department of the polish communist party central committee

a soviet nuclear submarine caught fire monday 
off norway the second such accident since april but the soviets 
said no radiation was released norway complained of a long delay in 
reporting the accident 
fire began on the echo ii class sub built in the 1960s when a 
reactor broke down 70 miles off the coast soviet and norwegian 
officials said 
the reactor was shut down and there were no casualties the 
soviet defense ministry said the vessel was bound for the soviet 
naval base at murmansk under auxiliary diesel power accompanied by 
other soviet vessels the ministry said 
adm vladimir n chernavin the soviet navy commander said on 
soviet television monday evening the submarines nuclear weapons 
were safe after the accident and no radioactivity was released he 
did not give subs name 
the authoritative british handbook janes fighting ships says 
echo ii submarines are 380 feet long with crews of 90 and have eight 
missile silos built for cruise missiles 
johan joergen holst the norwegian defense minister said we 
were not informed by the soviets but had to find out for ourselves 
about the fire 
he would not say how norway learned of the accident citing 
security considerations press reports said a radio distress signal 
from the sub to its base probably was intercepted 
holst said norway would test air and water in the area because 
the information we have is not detailed enough to know if there 
was a radiation leak 
in washington the state department said soviet claims of no 
radiation could not be confirmed until tests were completed 
norwegian intellegence learned of the accident at 5 am and air 
force f16 fighters confirmed half an hour later that smoke was 
billowing from it he said 
a cable from the soviet foreign ministry at 10 am responding 
to an official norwegian request for information said the fire 
started at 430 am holst said 
the norwegian rescue center received word shortly before 10 am 
that its helicopters and rescue vessels would not be needed the 
center cooperates with the murmansk rescue center under a 1988 
agreement covering emergencies at sea 
in his television interview chernavin said the stricken 
submarine would arrive in murmansk on thursday 
maj gullow gjeseth spokesman for norways supreme defense 
command said it took moscow more than a day to inform norway 
through diplomatic channels of the sinking april 7 of a mikeclass 
nuclear submarine in which 42 sailors died 
after the fire monday holst said it is unsatisfactory for us 
as a neighboring state not to be warned immediately about an 
accident aboard anuclear submarine 
when two such incidents happen so close together we cannot 
help but feel uneasy about these vessels close to our waters he 
said if there are operational problems with nuclearpowered 
submarines carrying nuclear weapons then we are uneasy 
the soviet cable to the norwegian embassy in moscow said there 
was a break due to fatigue in the first chamber of the reactor 
which has been shut down it said the sub declined offers of help 
because there are several soviet vessels in the vicinity 
izvestia the soviet government daily quoted defense minister 
dmitri t yazov as saying a pipe on a reactor burst and the hermetic 
seal was broken 
capt y kasatkin took his vessel to the surface and shut down 
nuclear power then other soviet ships provided water to cool the 
reactor yazov said 
the submarine crew fired a flare and waved off a norwegian rescue 
helicopter to indicate the ship did not want help said terje b 
lien of the norway rescue coordination center 
maj gjeseth said about 100 nuclear submarines including 30 of 
the echo ii class operate from the soviet base on the kola 
peninsula near norway 
it was the third recent accident involving a soviet vessel the 
soviet cruise ship maxim gorky was torn open by ice june 20 near 
norways spitzbergen island no casualties were reported among the 
950 people aboard who were evacuated

the governments land reform secretary 
has resigned but president corazon aquino said monday she would not 
accept the resignation until scandals in his department are 
investigated 
philip juico said he submitted the resignation saturday because 
of allegations of criminal conspiracy in the purchase of an estate 
in camarines sur province for distribution to peasants 
the purchase was blocked in december when officials said the 
government had agreed to pay 3 million for land worth only 142000 
juico and 20 department officials went on leave last month after 
newspapers disclosed the deal at the time juico said he was taking 
leave so an investigation mrs aquino ordered would not be 
influenced 
after the camarines sur sale was disclosed investigators said 
that in at least two other cases juicos department agreed to pay 
vastly inflated sums for land 
the secretary has denied wrongdoing and said subordinates 
deceived him he he said monday that his resignation was not an 
admission of guilt 
mrs aquino told reporters she had received the resignation but 
would wait for the investigating committees recommendations and 
then act accordingly 
j antonio carpio head of the national bureau of investigation 
said last week he had recommended criminal charges against 19 
department officials he refused to name them

alan c nelson criticized earlier this year in 
a justice department audit was replaced monday as head of the 
immigration and naturalization service the department said 
attorney general dick thornburgh announced in a brief statement 
that he was appointing james l buck deputy ins commissioner as 
acting head of the service to replace nelson who resigned 
justice department spokesman david runkel declined to say why 
nelson was being replaced before a permanent successor is found 
but a justice department source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said officials were concerned about the overall 
management at ins which was criticized in the audit ordered earlier 
this year by thornburgh 
officials were particularly concerned about the agencys budget 
because nelson as a lame duck had no incentive to control 
spending the source said 
nelson a holdover from the reagan administration has been 
privately criticized by department officals who have long signaled 
that he would be replaced 
his resignation has been pending since the start of the bush 
administration but was not accepted until this weekend runkel said 
gene mcnary the chief executive of st louis county mo is 
expected to be nominated by president bush to fill the post 
ins spokesman greg leo said senior officials of the agency were 
not informed of thornburghs decision to replace nelson with buck 
until 1030 am monday about the time the justice department 
issued its public announcement 
leo said nelson who was in california was first advised last 
wednesday that bush would be accepting his resignation and was 
formally informed of the action by telephone on saturday 
the audit said accounting management and administration were in 
disarray citing a growing backlog of cases awaiting adjudication 
it also noted that ins western regional officials had chartered 
jets to fly to conferences when commercial flights were available 
more recently nelson raised the ire of justice department 
officials by approving a trip to the national sheriffs association 
convention in honolulu of 19 officials of his agency 
nelson was forced to cancel the trips of all but three or four 
after the department issued an order to curtail the number of 
attendees traveling to conferences and meetings 
this episode the source said raised concerns in the justice 
department about nelsons commitment to controlling spending 
nelson defended his agency against criticisms in the audit which 
he called grossly deficient 
the audit noted that the agency had spent 1500 for an oil 
portrait of nelson justice department officials were also privately 
critical of a videotape tribute to nelson that ins produced at 
taxpayer expense 
in his statement thornburgh noted that nelson has led the 
immigration and naturalization service through difficult times 
during his tenure at ins nelson oversaw the amnesty program for 
illegal aliens that was enacted by the 1986 immigration reform and 
control act 
rep bruce morrison dconn who chairs the house immigration 
subcomittee said in a statement that he wished commissioner 
nelson well but added that i have long felt that a change in 
leadership was needed at ins 
but more than new leadership what is needed is a complete 
reorganization of the structure if the functions now collected under 
the ins are to be performed effectively

cities will be cut from 5 pm to 11 pm adding since records 
have been kept there has not been so severe a shortage of rain 
much of the electricity in this oklahomasized south american

idled 13 of the 14 turbines of the salto grande complex on the 
uruguay river a major power source 
for weeks uruguay bought electricity from neighboring argentina 
but this week argentina which has been having its own troubles is 
scheduled to resume power cuts itself 
a bit more than 8 inches of rain have fallen this year serrato

drinking water is being rationed in the small city of melo 
throughout uruguay grazing land has dried out and water is being 
trucked in for livestock 
the general strike was called by the national central of workers 
which is demanding a pay increase of about 30 percent starting july 
1 
the current minimum wage set in february is about 70 a month 
the increase would apply to many of the approximately 260000 
state employees who make up about onequarter of the total work 
force private sector companies raised wages by about 25 percent for 
the marchjune period 
inflation for 1989 is projected at 80 percent

south africas emerging new leaders must be 
pressured to quickly end apartheid because the time is running 
out for a congenial bloodless resolution australian prime 
minister bob hawke said monday 
it is the time now for pressure to bring them not to their 
knees but to the negotiating table hawke said in answer to 
questions at the national press club 
hawke said apartheid will be resolved one way or another and 
the time is running out where the conflict can be resolved in a 
congenial bloodless way 
i trust that what will be done by the rest of the world is 
to keep up pressure but to give the new leadership emerging in 
south africa the opportunity of responding getting them to 
understand that only by getting to the negotiating table in the near 
future are we going to have the opportunity of a resolution of the 
conflict in a bloodless way he continued 
leaders of south africas black resistance movement the african 
national congress and the black frontline countries bordering south 
africa want a multiracial society in the country hawke said they 
recognize that countrys future prosperity depends on keeping the 
whites white capital and expertise he said 
but those black leaders are running out of time with their 
younger generations who question such an attitude when it brings 
no positive response he added 
hawke described as silly the view of those who said that us 
economic sanctions voted by congress over former president ronald 
reagans veto failed to have the desired effect he noted that both 
the south african finance minister and central bank governor 
admitted the sanctions had the impact of forcing a lowering of 
standards and expectations

national party is expected to succeed president p w botha later

us and soviet negotiators resumed talks monday on 
monitoring nuclear tests and both sides predicted agreement soon 
they are drafting new monitoring provisions for two superpower 
treaties of the 1970s still not ratified by the us senate 
limiting military and other nuclear explosions to 150 kilotons 
one kiloton has the force of 1000 tons of tnt the bomb dropped 
on hiroshima japan in 1945 originally reckoned at 20 kilotons 
had an explosive force of 12 or 13 kilotons 
the goal is to get senate ratification which was withheld 
because of concern that the limits could not be enforced 
talks resumed after a sixmonth recess caused in part by the 
bush administration review of arms control and security policy 
mondays meeting was held at the us mission in geneva between 
delegation chiefs c paul robinson of the united states and igor 
palenykh of the soviet union 
robinson has said the purpose of the new negotiations expected 
to last five to six weeks is to produce complete agreements 
palenykh said there is a good basis for reaching practical results 
within a short time 
they said a verification plan for the 1976 peaceful nuclear 
explosions treaty is virtually complete but some work remains on how 
to prevent cheating on the 1974 threshold test ban treaty 
both sides are to be allowed various methods of measuring the 
power of explosions including onsite checks at each others 
testing grounds 
future negotiations are intended to produce more agreements to 
limit nuclear tests and ultimately prohibit the 
the soviet union has urged washington to join in a test ban but 
the united states says tests will be necessary as long as its 
military strategy includes reliance on nuclear weapons 
talks on nuclear testing are separate from ussoviet 
negotiations on reducing longrange nuclear arsenals which resumed 
in geneva last week 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said in washington 
that a realistic verification plan is crucial to success of the new 
talks on monitoring tests 
the us approach to these negotiations complements our efforts 
to reach agreements that will strengthen our security and enhance 
stability fitzwater said in a statement a priority for these 
stepbystep talks is to complete protocols to provide for effective 
verification of the two treaties 
he said the senate ratified neither treaty because they were 
not ratifiable in their original form 
our approach to these negotiations is based on a realistic 
approach to our security fitzwater said as long as we must 
rely on nuclear weapons we must continue to test to ensure their 
safety security reliability effectiveness and survivability

a federal agency violated its own policy when 
it cleared the way for an ohio coal company to strip mine coal in 
the wayne national forest congressional investigators have 
concluded 
it is improper for the office of surface mining to have based 
this decision on considerations other than its stated policy said 
a report by the house interior committees mining subcommittee 
delivered to the interior department parent of the office of 
surface mining on friday and made available on monday 
agency records showed the decision to let belville coal co of 
ironton ohio to mine was based on flimsy reasoning a skimpy review 
and no independent documentation according to the report 
carl close the director of the pittsburgh office of the office 
of surface mining has said he consulted a staff attorney and 
believed he was on firm legal ground when he made the nowcontested 
decision 
close in december reversed a 1986 decision and determined that 
the company had a valid existing right to mine in the 190000acre 
forest on the ohio river in other words mineral rights that 
predated creation of the forest that the federal government was 
bound to recognize 
it is inappropriate for a decision of this magnitude involving 
approximately 5440 acres of national forest land to have been 
based on a dearth of written independent agency analysis and 
supporting agency documentation the report said 
no record exists which suggests that the office of surface 
mining conducted a thorough analysis before ruling that the 
company had a legal right to strip mine for coal said the report 
the company has submitted an application for state mining permits 
covering 180 acres spokesman todd ambs said the ohio department of 
natural resources will probably act on it sometime before the end 
of the summer 
interior department spokesman john wright said monday a deputy 
assistant secretary was reviewing the wayne forest determination 
to see what prompted the decision how it was based and he 
could not comment on the report 
the congressional probe was conducted at the request of rep nick 
rahall dwva chairman of the subcommittee he has asked interior 
secretary manual lujan to freeze activity on all pending coal rights 
claims until theres a federal standard in place 
wright said a reply probably would be ready next week 
the forest service part of the agriculture department and the 
congressional investigators contend the office of surface mining 
should have followed state standards since theres no federal 
standard governing companies that buy previous owners mineral 
rights and apply to mine on land like national forests 
an unsigned undated office of surface mining memorandum provided 
to the investigators said turning down the coal company was 
probably the most defensible position legally

eastern airlines and its pilots union met 
under court order monday negotiating for the first time since 
eastern sought permission last week to cancel the pilots contract 
and impose wage and other concessions 
representatives of eastern and the air line pilots association 
met with david i shapiro the courtappointed examiner overseeing 
the airline on behalf of the bankruptcy court 
a pilots union spokesman said nothing fruitful came from the 
talks which were ordered by us bankruptcy judge burton r 
lifland it was essentially feelingout process a discussion of 
basic issues said the spokesman dan asbhy another session was 
scheduled for tuesday 
in a related matter a house subcommittee plans this week to 
examine the impact of the nearly 4monthold strike and a senate 
panel has asked the general accounting office to assess the impact 
easterns proposed reorganization would have on the airline industry 
a group of six senators also is asking transportation secretary 
samuel skinner to at least temporarily block eastern from selling 
more assets a major part of the airlines reorganization plan 
a consultant to the pilots union said over the weekend that 
shapiro would oppose easterns bid to terminate the contract 
shapiro did not return calls seeking comment monday and eastern said 
it wasnt aware of shapiros position 
most of easterns pilots are in effect striking although 
technically they are honoring the pickets of the striking 
machinists as are easterns flight attendants 
the meeting at shapiros law office here came five days after 
eastern requested about 50 million in wage and benefit concessions 
as well as changes in work policies that would allow eastern to 
increase pilots hours 
weve been trying to get the pilots to meet with us for some 
time said eastern spokesman jim ashlock we at least see this 
as having brought that about 
ashlock declined to say whether eastern had revised any of its 
positions 
ashby said easterns statements that the pilots have refused to 
meet were groundless and appeared to be part of an effort to 
convince the bankruptcy court that the pilots were acting in bad 
faith 
the federal railway labor act which also covers airline 
collective bargaining requires both sides to continue negotiating 
unless an impasse is declared and the talks referred to a federal 
mediator 
youd never know it by what the company says but weve met with 
them at every scheduled meeting ashby said 
eastern said it needed contract concessions from the pilots as 
part of its plan to reorganize and emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protections as a smaller carrier 
lifland would have to approve the reorganization plan which 
includes major asset sales the unions unsuccessfully have sought 
the sale of eastern 
lifland said three weeks ago that the court would no longer 
consider the buyout offer of chicago commodities trader joseph 
ritchie although he said ritchie was free to pursue his offer with 
eastern 
the airline has said it doesnt plan to sell but the unions have 
maintained that ritchies effort to buy eastern continues 
on captol hill the senate committee on commerce science and 
transportation has requested the gao investigation saying in a 
letter that its review should examine whether the proposed 
business plan of eastern has any realistic prospect of revitalizing 
the carrier 
in a separate letter to skinner six senators called on the 
transportation secretary to seek a delay in additional sales that 
could further erode the competitive base in the airline industry 
the senators specifically cited easterns reported plans to sell 
its south american routes 
the senators who wrote to skinner were democrats frank r 
lautenberg of new jersey wendell h ford of kentucky bob graham of 
florida daniel patrick moynihan of new york john f kerry of 
massachusetts and republican alfonse m damato of new york

attorneys for deathrow convicts blasted a supreme court ruling 
monday that allows the execution of murderers who committed their 
crimes as young as 16 while prosecutors applauded the decision 
in my opinion its utterly barbaric to execute any 16 or 
17yearold said sapulpa okla attorney bob ravitz 
his client sean sellers was convicted in 1986 of killing his 
parents and a convenience store clerk in oklahoma city at age 16 
ravitz argued that his client was under satans influence 
asked about the decision oklahoma assistant attorney general bob 
nance said i think were pleased from the attorney general on 
down 
in 54 votes the supreme court said the constitutions ban on 
cruel and unusual punishment does not prohibit execution of older 
juveniles or adults with only the reasoning capacity of children 
in a second instance however the court ruled that convicted 
murderers have a right to demand that sentencing juries and judges 
consider mental retardation as a possible mitigating factor 
the juvenile killers ruling affects about 25 of the 2200 death 
row inmates across the nation 
there are at least 11 states with one or more inmates under a 
death penalty for crimes committed before they were 18 according to 
state officials texas topped the list with nine inmates followed 
by alabama and georgia with four each 
the supreme court apparently drew the line for capital punishment 
at age 16 last year when they voted 53 to throw out the death 
sentence of an oklahoma murderer who committed the crime when 15 
the ruling will probably not affect paula cooper because she was 
15 when she stabbed a retired gary ind bible teacher to death 
said her attorney william l touchette miss coopers case has drawn 
international attention and a call for clemency from pope john paul 
ii 
in west palm beach fla lawyer james eisenberg reacted with 
sadness to the courts ruling 
eisenberg was the trial attorney for cleo lecroy who was 
convicted in florida in the 1981 shooting deaths of a couple camping 
in rural palm beach county lecroy was 17 at the time of the crime 
even countries such as russia have recognized that killing 
their children is not something that people ought to do and im 
sorry that in this country we dont feel the same way dont have 
the respect for our kids lives eisenberg said 
carolyn snurkowski who is in charge of death appeals for florida 
attorney general bob butterworth said the ruling seemed to affirm 
the system that we currently employ 
in its decision the high court upheld the death sentence of 
missouri inmate heath wilkins who was 16 when he stabbed a kansas 
city area liquor store clerk to death in 1985 
michele coleman of the missouri coalition against the death 
penalty called the ruling devastating 
it just gives our state rein to execute children i can just 
hear prosecutors using the supreme courts ruling in their closing 
arguments ms coleman said 
missouri attorney general william webster called such arguments 
hogwash 
theres a lot of people that say its going to open the door 
thats ludicrous said webster 
webster said that before a juvenile can face the death penalty 
he or she has to be certified as an adult go through a battery of 
mental exams and have their age considered as a mitigating 
circumstance by the judge 
but wilkins courtappointed attorney public defender nancy 
mckerrow said courts decide whether to try a youngster as an adult 
according to the seriousness of the crime not the youngsters 
mental nature 
where are the safeguards mckerrow said they make no 
determination of a childs maturity theyre looking at the 
seriousness of the crime then age becomes irrelevant the fact that 
wilkins was 16 years old made no difference

exhusband mike tyson and the thrill of danger continues to 
draw her to the heavyweight boxing champion

of the comments the boxer shrugged and said come on man 
a new biography of tyson fire and fear the inside story of 
mike tyson describes him as wifebeater who reportedly said that 
he never hit an opponent as hard as he hit givens on one occasion 
the two were married feb 7 1988 and givens filed for divorce 
in october the divorce was finalized last month 
givens denied that her mother ruth roper helped manipulate the 
boxers life during the shortlived marriage 
people always say well why was your mother around i had to 
beg this woman to be around i couldnt do it by myself she 
said 
also false she said is the rumor that she moved to california 
shortly before filing divorce papers to take advantage of that 
states communityproperty laws 
the funny thing is not only didnt i get a fortune i didnt 
get anything she said

the marriage

us could what people dont understand what they have forgotten in

house for 48 hours because of threats allegedly made by the citys 
airport commissioner 
the commissioner luther boykins faces two misdemeanor counts of 
thirddegree assault against schoemehl 
boykins allegedly made the threats because of ordinances adopted 
last week that sharply curtailed the duties of his exwife city 
license collector billie a boykins

problems going to meetings a high school reunion and a jefferson 
day rally aides said the schoemehl family returned home sunday

number of his bodyguards from one to four he also decided to move 
his family to a safe place as he has done in the past during 
protests and demonstrations in front of his house

auditor margaret kellys report that ms boykins had failed to 
collect millions of dollars in revenues due the city

secretary of state james a baker iii looking 
beyond the current wave of arrests and executions said monday night 
the leaders of china cannot block forever the countrys rendezvous 
with freedom 
baker told 1000 guests at a blacktie dinner of the asia society 
in new york we will be there to help when the day follows the 
night 
bakers theme in a 25minute speech to the group was that a 
new order of freedom is emerging in asia and the pacific he 
called repression in china and burma rites of passage and spoke 
philosophically of recent events in beijing 
we and some other nations have suspended business as usual 
baker said but we and the rest of the world must not let our 
revulsion at this repression blind us to pressure for reform 
he added china has suffered a tragic setback but the story is 
not over 
the asia society is a private organization dedicated to improving 
americans understanding of asian affairs 
meanwhile monday chinese authorities told 11 americans not to 
leave kunming while charges of distributing religious tracts were 
investigated a us official said we expect the matter to be 
resolved soon 
the americans went to china june 13 despite a warning by the 
state department after soldiers fired on students june 34 in 
beijing 
the americans being held were believed to be associated with an 
evangelical christian group the latter rain ministry of litchfield 
ill 
the charges against them were not considered serious under 
chinese law a us diplomat was on his way from the american 
consulate in chengdu to investigate 
in the past americans who distributed religious tracts have been 
fined and asked to leave 
according to adam shub a state department spokesman the 11 
americans who had planned to return home early next month were 
detained at the yunnan university guest house and charged with 
passing out religious material to the public their passports were 
taken and they were forbidden to leave the city 
laura templeton secretary of latter rain ministries inc in 
litchfield said the group was 99 percent sure the members were 
in no serious trouble in kunming 
they werent scheduled to leave for hong kong until next 
tuesday and i am sure they will be leaving on schedule she said 
at the white house president bush said the united states 
intended to continue trying to convince the chinese leadership 
that it is in their interest to keep reform moving forward 
despite the recent bloodshed said presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater 
fitzwater said bush made the observation during an oval office 
meeting with japans new foreign minister hiroshi mitsuzuka 
the foreign minister said japan was encouraged by the 
presidents experience in the region and hoped our two countries 
would keep each other informed on our views fitzwater said in a 
statement bush was head of the us liaison office in china in 
197475 
mitsuzuka speaking before baker at the society dinner called 
chinas path toward isolation in the international community 
regrettable and appealed to chinas new leaders to govern in a 
spirit of reconcilation and restraint 
earlier fitzwater was asked at a white house briefing if bush 
had sent any communication to the new chinese communist party chief 
jiang zemin who replaced the ousted zhao ziyang 
i dont believe he has communicated with the new communist 
party chief fitzwater said i dont know whether he knows him 
or not 
australia prime minister bob hawke insisted that he bush and 
the leaders of britain and france must walk a very difficult 
dividing line in supporting continued economic reform in china 
while denouncing the crackdown on political freedom 
hawke who met with bush at the presidential retreat in camp 
david md told reporters at the national press club we have to 
express a position without equivocation of condemnation at the 
same time make clear we want to do what can be done to assist the 
processes of economic reform the interst of the people of china 
and particularly those who are committed to political reform would 
be very adversely affected if by the action of the rest of the world 
china was forced to turn completely in upon itself because the 
process of economic reform would be diminished and subsequently the 
opportunity to political reform 
baker leaves july 3 on a trip to asia his speech monday night 
was his first summarizing bush administration policy on the region 
the postwar era is over he said in asia as in europe a 
new order is taking shape 
baker will stop in tokyo to help plan multinational economic aid 
for the philippines then in brunei he will attend the annual 
meeting of the association of southeast asian nations this is an 
economic grouping of brunei indonesia malaysia the philippines 
singapore and thailand 
the purpose of my trip is to establish the framework for a new 
pacific partnership he told the private group to build that 
new partnership we need continued american engagement in the 
regions politics commerce and security 
above all baker stressed us ties to japan 
he called for a more creative sharing of global 
responsibilities and praised the japanese for shouldering more of 
the cost of keeping us troops in the country about 40 percent 
and baker said japan soon will be the largest donor in the 
world of overseas development assistance yet mitsuzuka stressed 
the need for america to maintain a strong political economic and 
military presence and commitment to the region 
turning to china baker concluded the country clearly had decided 
to abandon its isolation from regional progress but the pace of 
political change did not match the aspirations of the people 
defending us policy against calls for sterner measures in 
response to the violence baker said we have acted in a measured 
way 
he said it would be a mistake to dismantle the relationship the 
united states built up over two decades with the communist 
government in beijing 
however baker said americans and the us government will stand 
for democratic values and he said chinas rendezvous with 
freedom like its rendezvous with the advancing nations of the 
pacific cannot be long delayed

an army patrol battled leftist rebels at 
their remote highland stronghold and killed 42 of them in some of 
the worst fighting in the rebels nineyear insurgency a military 
official said monday 
the military refused to provide information on army casualties 
the troops and shining path rebels fought sunday evening near the 
village of pampaccori 40 miles northeast of ayacucho a military 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
the military spokesman said troops also captured a large number 
of weapons and subversive propaganda 
he said it was one of the biggest losses of life suffered by the 
shining path in their nineyearold fight against the government 
the ayacucho region 235 miles southeast of lima is the 
birthplace of the shining path insurgency and remains its stronghold 
the guerrilla organization began its fight against the government 
in may 1980 after 10 years of grass roots organizing among indian 
peasants in this impoverished region 
since then the violence has spread throughout the country and 
more than 15000 people have died in clashes between troops and 
guerrillas as well as in rebel attacks

demonstrators shot while resisting the armys 
drive to crush seven weeks of prodemocracy protests got what they 
deserved a senior military officer said monday 
in another development an explosion aboard a train late monday 
killed 20 people and seriously injured 11 in the suburbs of 
shanghai an offical of the shanghai foreign affairs office reported 
the official xinhua news agency said an onthespot investigation 
showed the explosion was caused by dynamite the shanghai official 
on tuesday called it an accident and said it happened at 1113 pm 
monday in songjiang county 18 miles southwest of shanghai 
he said the train was bound from hangzhou to shanghai and that 
the explosion occurred in a seated compartment less than an hour 
before it was scheduled to reach its destination but that he had no 
further details 
he said an undetermined unknown number of passengers also were 
slightly injured 
japans kyodo news service said the explosion occurred in a 
toilet 
on the political scene on monday the official press said the 
communist party was prepared to expel members who participated in 
the studentled movement for a freer china suggesting a fullscale 
purge following saturdays announcement that moderate party chief 
zhao ziyang had been ousted from his party posts 
a us embassy spokesman said two americans a teacher and a 
student at nankai university in nearby tianjin were ordered to 
leave china by friday 
teacher mark radicia and student helen qubain were being expelled 
because evidently they were very involved in the student 
movement he said speaking on condition of anonymity the two 
whose ages and hometowns were not available were questioned by 
security forces he said 
a us official said monday in washington that a group of 11 
americans who went to china against state department travel advice 
were charged by police in kunming with distributing religious 
literature and ordered to remain in the city 
the americans names and hometowns were not disclosed the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said a us diplomat 
was bound for kunming from chengdu to look into the situation he 
said the charge evidently was not a serious offense 
li zhiyun one of the commanders of the june 34 military assault 
on beijing said he had no regrets about what chinese and 
foreign witnesses have said was a massacre of unarmed residents and 
students 
li speaking to foreign reporters invited to tour tiananmen 
square stressed the government line that no shots were fired at 
students during the assault to remove thousands of student activists 
from the square 
the whole process was nonviolent no one used guns he said 
li said troops shot into the air once when thugs occupying a 
building to the southeast of the square opened fire wounding one 
soldier 
he acknowledged some innocent people may have been wounded 
when troops fought to reach the square but said people were warned 
not to go out that night 
when our troops moved to the square we received persistent 
resistance li said individuals even used guns to kill our 
warriors we were forced to defend ourselves this group of people 
got what they deserved 
the government puts the death toll from the assault at about 300 
and says most were soldiers who were attacked by mobs chinese 
witnesses and western intelligence reports say up to 3000 people 
were shot to death or crushed by tanks as the military stormed the 
city 
during a tour of the square he said black burn patches on the 
pavement were caused by students who set fire to tents to stop the 
troop advance he called stories that troops had burned the bodies 
of students were totally untrue 
the monument was decorated with banners reading carry on the 
will of the revolutionary martyrs a reference to soldiers killed 
during the attack and promote the glorious traditions of the 
troops 
bushes and grass around the monument had been replanted and 
newly planted flowers bloomed in boxes between the monument and the 
mausoleum where mao tsetungs body lies in state 
li said the troops returned the square to the people but 
could not say when it would be reopened to the public he said armed 
thugs were at large 
about 1800 people including up to 500 in beijing have been 
arrested nationwide since the crackdown in beijing prompted 
widespread disturbances 
the party central committee on saturday announced that zhao a 
pioneer of chinas past decade of economic reform was stripped of 
all party posts for supporting the turmoils and splitting the 
party 
shanghais wen hui bao daily newspaper said 14 members of the 
wild geese suicide squad one of many groups of young workers 
who joined street protests were sentenced to up to 13 years for 
slashing car tires beating drivers and blocking traffic the report 
was seen in beijing on monday

a report today that federal officials are 
underestimating the spread of aids raises questions about the 
nations ability to cope with the crisis say congressmen who are 
monitoring the epidemic 
a general accounting office report says the number of aids cases 
expected to be diagnosed over the next three years has been 
undercounted by as much as onethird by the centers for disease 
control 
the really frightening aspect of this report is it proves how 
little we know about the aids epidemic rep ron wyden dore 
said sunday he and reps john dingell dmich and henry waxman 
dcalif requested the study 
when these projections of aids cases go awry it undermines 
research destroys the validity of our plans for taking care of aids 
victims and conveys a false sense of confidence to our fellow 
citizens that the aids epidemic is under control wyden said

question whether a firstofits kind bill approved in florida will 
prevent accidental shootings 
we do feel there will be some difficulty in enforcement since 
it will take a child committing some dreadful act before law

dont expect to read about fairport convention in 
the rolling stone illustrated history of rock amp roll theyre 
not even mentioned 
and dont look for fairport convention in the billboard book of 
top 40 hits they never had a hit single 
while reunions of the rolling stones and the who make headlines 
fairport convention quietly tours the country by trailer appearing 
in small clubs 
but since four soon to be six young english musicians formed 
the band in 1967 fairport convention has produced some of the 
finest folkrock of the past two decades 
if youre asking whether i thought the band would still be 
traveling about in the late 1980s the answer would be no said 
guitarist simon nicol an original member who helped put fairport 
convention back together in 1985 
their early records were heavily influenced by the beatles and 
the byrds with spirited harmonies and a tight rhythm section 
besides nicol the group featured the brilliant guitar playing and 
songwriting of richard thompson and the songwriting and soulful 
vocals of sandy denny 
you had a band at the end of every street and for most people 
it was a phase they went through nicol recalled the unlucky 
ones got caught on the treadmill we wanted to get off the 
treadmill 
by their fourth album 1969s liege and lief fairport 
convention was recording traditional english songs and making 
greater use of the mandolin and fiddle instruments that had been 
rarely used in a rock n roll format 
they built a small but devoted following with the originals 
come all ye and meet on the ledge the traditional matty 
groves and covers of bob dylans ill keep it with mine and 
percys song 
i think that the byrds had taken their roots and made it viable 
encouraged us nicol said of the american folkrock group 
the group went through several personnel changes and by the early 
70s thompson and denny had left to pursue solo careers the band 
struggled without them eventually calling it quits in 1979 
but in august 1980 fairport convention minus denny who died 
in 1978 reunited for a concert in cropredy england encouraged by 
the response the band played again the following summer and now 
headlines an annual twoday festival of folkrock and traditional 
music 
they began recording again in 1985 with nicol and two other 
fairport convention veterans bassist dave pegg and drummer dave 
mattacks forming the core of the group thompson was well 
established as a solo star so guitarist martin allcock and fiddler 
ric sanders were recruited 
the three of us had gotten on terribly well nicol said 
wed known martin for years he was very enthusiastic and really 
wanted to play with us ric was also a fan we rehearsed three days 
and found out it was going to work 
they have since released four albums gladys leap 
expletive delighted in real time and most recently red 
and gold fairport convention has also toured extensively using 
mostly new material as well as matty groves and meet on the 
ledge 
its impossible to say what a typical fairport audience is 
because they all look different pegg said we get 17 and 
18yearold kids who have discovered the music for the first time 
and people in their 50s a lot of our audience are more familiar 
with the new stuff 
the title track from red and gold was written by ralph 
mctell a friend of the band who learned that cropredy had been the 
site in 1644 of a bloody battle during the english civil war 
the album also includes a cover of open the door richard a 
pair of instrumentals written by sanders the rose hip and the 
battle and a traditional ballad the beggars song 
its just surprising when you come up with traditional songs 
that people havent heard before pegg said the best ones have 
been recorded if not by us then by other bands like steeleye span 
they got about 50 percent of the really good songs and we got the 
rest

in her small laboratory maritza vela 
garzon gently opens a 400yearold book as if it were a jewel case 
the red and black gothic type reveals a breathtaking antiquity 
and a tragic carelessness there are thumbsized holes in the first 
few pages 
someone put scotch tape on these pages she said they 
thought they were doing the right thing keeping a tear from 
worsening 
the glue from the tape eventually ate through the old paper 
mrs vela garzon the colombian national librarys only staff 
expert in book preservation and restoration hopes to repair the 
damage its a painstaking task 
and a frustrating one 
among the librarys 28000 old and rare books are entire jesuit 
libraries seized in the late 1700s by the spaniards about 40 
volumes date back to before the invention of moveable type in 1500 
the oldest printed in 1480 is by st thomas of aquinas many were 
printed or illustrated by hand 
they beg for attention 
its not a question of negligence the librarys director 
ruben sierra explained in an interview its simply a lack of 
money 
the same refrain can be heard across financially strapped latin 
america where governments struggling with big foreign debts 
grinding poverty and other urgent economic and social problems have 
little time or money for cultural preservation 
sierra said hes heard stories from state librarians of much 
worse situations in other countries one national librarys shelves 
are full of cats he said because its the only affordable way they 
can deal with the rats 
indeed compared with most neighboring countries colombia enjoys 
a thriving economy and a low inflation rate running at about 25 
percent a year but its 20 billiondebt is still burdensome and a 
program of relative public austerity has been in effect for years 
they promised us some money but it didnt come sierra said 
theres always something else that takes precedence last year it 
was emergency flood aid for the coast this year who knows what it 
will be 
sierra said he expects to receive about 30 million pesos the 
equivalent of about 80000 this year to run the 900000volume 
library it is less than half what the library asked for 
nonetheless he is hopeful the government will come up with an 
extra 200 million pesos about 540000 next year for creating a 
respectable conservation and restoration center 
mrs vela garzon works alone in her small lab crowded with 
equipment much of it donated by the organization of american 
states she has one small chest for fumigating the several hundred 
old books infected with mold a few dozen at a time 
this is the first step there is much left to do she said 
for right now we can only take care of the most valuable or 
those that most urgently need attention 
the library was created in the 1770s when colombia was still a 
colony of spain authorities needed a place to shelter thousands of 
leatherbound volumes confiscated from jeusit colleges and missions 
when the roman catholic clerical order was expelled from the spanish 
kingdom 
all of the rare volumes have been catalogued not so in the rest 
of the library boxes holding some 40000 books are piled high in 
the cellar awaiting revision no ones sure when they arrived or 
exactly what they hold 
according to sierra a predecessor solved a similar problem in 
1972 by simply selling 15000 books as scrap to a local paper 
company 
it was a barbarous act he said but he added that some of 
the books were salvaged including historically important records

for the past several years south 
africas hulking pugnosed armored cars called casspirs have run 
the roads and plowed the bush of ovamboland in the search for 
guerrillas of the southwest african peoples organization swapo 
to the south africans who invented it the 11ton vehicle with 
its heavy firepower and sturdy protection against landmines it is 
the ultimate weapon for counterinsurgency warfare 
to the local people the casspir is the embodiment of evil they 
largely support swapo and they look upon the south africans an an 
army of occupation 
now with the 23year bush war supposedly at an end and namibia 
preparing for independence from south africa under united nations 
supervision a change of image may be in store for what one bumper 
sticker seen here calls casspir an unfriendly ghost 
un police monitors assigned to watch the local security forces 
and report abuses of authority during the election campaign are 
preparing to acquire at least 10 casspirs for their own use 
in un livery white paint with big black un letters on 
the side the armored cars will no longer instill the fear that 
many people say they felt whenever the army or police roared past 
turrets bristling with machine guns 
although various versions of the casspir have been employed by 
regular and paramilitary forces in ovamboland its fearsome 
reputation stems mainly from the koevoet the counterinsurgency 
police made up of local black officers led by white south africans 
koevoet the names mean crowbar in afrikaans is notorious 
for tough and often brutal tactics in prying out the swapo 
guerrillas infiltrating across the border from angola 
local people tell of terrorist raids beatings and crop 
destructions in koevoets campaign to crush swapo and a few koevoet 
members have been charged with murder 
some of koevoets casspirs actually a more powerful version 
called the wolf turbo have been earmarked for the un police 
monitors operating out of oshakati the nerve center for un 
operations in the region 
peter fitzgerald a silverhaired irishman on leave from his post 
as a dublin police superintendent to serve as district commander of 
the un contingent calls the casspirs absolutely the most 
intimidating articles i have ever seen in my life 
he said it was necessary however for the un transition 
assistance group to have its own casspirs in order to keep track of 
the local police who continue to use them on bush patrols of up to 
seven days at a time unlike the police the untag vehicles will 
have no weapons on board 
under un resolution 435 which spells out procedures for 
namibias independence by early next year koevoet has already been 
integrated into the southwest african police however the unit 
remains active and reports persist of koevoet members continuing to 
badger residents who express proswapo sympathies 
un officials at the operational level say proof of police abuse 
is hard to obtain and untag recently moved to double to 1000 the 
number of monitors assigned as police watchdogs 
the sight of numerous police casspirs in recent days with their 
50caliber machine guns still mounted also indicates that the police 
forces have not fully complied with a un proviso for disarming the 
vehicles 
fred eckhard a un spokesman said it was understood that the 
police would carry only small arms while not clearly defined he 
said this was generally taken to mean nothing more than sidearms 
and semiautomatic rifles mounted machine guns would violate that 
understanding he said 
many south africans see the casspir as the proudest achievement 
of a homegrown arms industry springing out of a 1972 arms import 
embargo imposed by the united nations in response to the south 
african governments refusal to abandon apartheid 
military sources say that despite the embargo south africa now 
manufactures 95 percent of its own weapons and has become the 
worlds 10th largest arms exporter with customers in 32 countries 
casspirs have reportedly been put on display at international 
arms shows 
the name casspir is an acronym derived from the vehicles 
designers the council for scientific research and the south 
african police for whom it was originally developed different 
versions are tailored for a specific task carrying infantry into 
battle or urban riot control 
its most innovative feature is a heavily armored vshaped 
underbody designed to deflect rather than absorb the blast of a 
land mine 
while swapo has periodically claimed to have damaged or destroyed 
the vehicles in the bush war south african military sources say 
casspirs that hit swapolaid mines suffered only minor crew injuries 
and damage that was easily repaired

seniority isnt what it used to be 
once the coin of congressional status it was devalued by reform 
there are new status symbols including the personal political 
action committee a growing practice that is now the target o new 
reform proposals 
by setting up a committee a member of the house or senate can 
collect campaign funds and dole them out as contributions to other 
members or to candidates who presumably will not forget the favor 
they are called leadership pacs and there are about 50 of 
them they do seem to be a mark of success among them are the 
political action committees of the three newlyinstalled leaders of 
the democratic majority and the two top men in the republican 
minority 
ross k baker a rutgers university political scientist says in 
a study published by the twentieth century fund that the number of 
leadership pacs funneling contributions from one member of congress 
to another is likely to grow 
pacs seem to offer members a kind of prestige he says to 
have a pac is for some a mark of their sovereignty in a congress 
whose 535 members act increasingly like independent entrepreneurs 
a personal pac also can be used to finance the political travels 
of the member who sets it up enabling a senator or representative 
to appear at events around the country a vital opening phase of a 
presidential campaign 
baker concentrates reform suggestions on the use of pacs by 
members of congress to extend their influence with other members he 
dates the rise in the use of campaign donations to influence 
insidethehouse competition from the fall of the system under which 
committee chairmen were chosen strictly by seniority that change 
made chairmanships subject to secret ballots in the majority party 
caucus 
political action committees of all varieties are big business 
they also are a favorite target of reformers who see them as 
vehicles for special interest money and influence their support 
goes heavily to incumbents they can give a candidate up to 5000 
an election individuals are limited to 1000 
they are an unintended byproduct of the campaign reforms that 
followed the watergate scandal president bush has proposed 
legislation that would ban contributions by political action 
committees effectively eliminating them because they have no other 
purpose 
labor business and interest group pacs 4268 of them paid 
out 148085016 in campaign contributions in 1988 while the 
leadership pacs represent only a fraction of that baker said their 
influence is significant in part because of their sponsorship so 
too he said is their impact on the inside politics of congress on 
contests for committee chairmanships and on leadership elections 
baker cites the inhouse campaign of rep william h gray iii of 
pennsylvania now the democratic whip for his previous rung on the 
leadership ladder as chairman of the democratic caucus 
gray wasnt shy about using campaign contributions to his 
colleagues to gain support in that threeway contest he set up his 
own pac the committee for democratic opportunity and sent out a 
request for contributions to be relayed to other house democrats 
bakers study recounts grays request for checks for 500 or 
1000 so that i can begin to build the active support within the 
democratic members of congress to win this key leadership position 
the gray committee made about 140000 in campaign contributions 
to 95 candidates during the 1988 election season according to the 
federal elections commission speaker thomas s foleys pac the 
house leadership fund contributed more than 134500 to 74 other 
democrats the effective government committee the pac set up by 
rep richard a gephardt dmo now majority leader spent 
222000 most of it on his unsuccessful campaign for the democratic 
presidential nomination his pac gave 24000 to eight other 
candidates 
while those party leaders have their own committees bakers 
study suggests that their leadership tasks may be made more 
difficult by the proliferation of leadership pacs 
the greater the number of important players armed with their 
own checkbooks the harder the job of party leaders as they try to 
manage the delicate and often frustrating task of building 
parliamentary majorities he says the result is an increasing 
fragmentation of power and decreasing importance of parties the 
basis of our form of democracy 
pacs not only post a threat to the traditional structure of our 
government they also contribute to the growing perception of a 
political system run by money a system that is if not corrupt 
corruptible baker says

almost every day a small group shows up on 
parliament hill to protest prime minister brian mulroneys austerity 
budget but they have yet to set off nationwide outcries against 
belttightening and higher taxes 
mulroneys government drew up the austerity budget as a means of 
controlling canadas budget deficit and austerity may be the tone 
he is setting at least for the start of his second term 
mulroney led his progressive conservative party to a second 
consecutive majority government last fall in an election whose 
overwhelming issue was approval of the free trade agreement with the 
united states 
his victory cleared the way for the pact to take effect jan 1 as 
scheduled 
however his critics charge that since the trade agreement was 
the key issue in the campaign the election outcome did not give 
mulroney a mandate to tackle the budget deficit at the expense of 
programs that the canadian government traditionally has supported 
although the canadian public has remained largely silent a 
gallup poll published june 15 indicated that only 30 percent of 
canadians would vote now for mulroney compared to 45 percent for 
the opposition liberal party led by john turner it was the 
progressive conservatives worst showing in that opinion poll since 
november 1987 
but the prime minister has little to worry about for now 
he is at least three years away from having to call another 
election and early in his term is an ideal time to put unpopular 
programs into place 
several factors appear to be working in mulroneys favor to 
defuse any public indignation at what once would have been 
unthinkable changes in government programs such as unemployment 
insurance 
both major opposition parties are involved in internal races of 
their own because their longtime leaders have announced they are 
stepping down 
the liberals wont pick a new leader until june 1990 although 
turner is staying on in the interim and spearheading his partys 
criticism of the budget 
the socialist new democratic party which scored 21 percent in 
the june gallup poll will pick a new leader to replace veteran ed 
broadbent at the outset of winter 
mulroney and his supporters also started immediately after the 
november election to lay the groundwork for the plans to bring the 
deficit under control 
the alternative is to keep this mountain of debt growing and 
place it on the backs of your kids and grandchildren mulroney 
told canadians 
what brought more public furor was a leak of the budget the night 
before it was to be released april 27 a violation of traditional 
canadian secrecy about the document until it is officially reported 
in parliament 
the debate about the leak lasted weeks and as political 
columnist carol goar wrote in the toronto star it kept the 
nations mind off one of the most painful and pivotal budgets in 
recent history 
in the meantime analysts say they have found that as little as 
one fifth of the savings in the budget intended for deficit control 
come from spending restraints the rest comes from increasing taxes 
a survey by the private global economics consulting firm found 
that tax increases amounted to nearly 72 billion canadian dollars 
6 billion of the 9 million dollars 75 billion that could be 
considered deficit control measures 
lloyd axworthy one of the most prominent liberal members in 
parliament said much of the impact of the prime ministers budget 
has been camouflaged 
theres going to be a delayed reaction he maintained in an 
interview i dont think theyre out of the woods on the budget at 
all its like a perpetual toothache 
despite the raised taxes and cut expenses a deficit for 198990 
remains of 305 billion canadian dollars 253 billion that has 
prompted mulroneys supporters in the business community to charge 
that he has not moved strongly enough to bring the deficit under 
control 
the ratio of debt to gross domestic product is about 5 percent 
double that of the united states and second only to italy among the 
leading industrial nations

abortion is a secret act in mexico federal 
law makes it a crime except in cases of rape or if the womans life 
is endangered the roman catholic church calls all abortions a sin 
yet mexican health officials estimate that one in 10 pregnancies 
end that way every year the estimate may be low 
the last time an attempt was made to change the law in 1979 
proabortion lawmakers were beaten in the streets their photographs 
appeared on posters calling them assassins marchers denounced 
them as communists 
but proabortion activists are ready to make another try and 
antiabortion activists are girding for battle 
there is pressure by a lot of leftist groups to legalize 
abortion said jorge serrano limon leader of the prolife 
organization but we are ready to fight this dangerous movement 
the prochoice side has been encouraged by news and other 
accounts of the arrest interrogation and alleged mistreatment of 
eight women after they had abortions they are also watching closely 
the abortion debate in the united states 
the arrests took place march 16 when teresa suarez and nine 
other women were returning to mexico city from an illegal abortion 
clinic in the adjacent state of mexico 
three police intelligence agents stopped their van at gunpoint 
bitches suarez said they shouted at them whores 
assassins 
they were taken to an intelligence police jail where they were 
later joined by a doctor two nurses and a receptionist who were 
arrested at the clinic 
suarez 27 a schoolteachers wife and mother of a 3yearold 
daughter said she and the others were slapped and pistolwhipped 
she added that they could hear the screams of their elderly doctor 
being tortured with electric shocks then she said they were 
interrogated about their abortions 
the women also were subjected to what suarez called painful and 
humiliating pelvic examinations in the presence of three men who 
made sexually disparaging remarks 
i felt like i was going to faint because of the abortion the 
emotional stress and the fact i had not eaten since the day 
before suarez recalled in an interview with the associated press 
after 14 hours the women were released without being charged 
mexico city police spokesman francisco algorri confirmed that 
uniformed intelligence agents arrested the women in an interview 
algorri handed over a copy of the arrest report saying thats 
all the information i have 
the report did not say what happened after the arrests algorri 
would not comment on suarezs charges that the women were mistreated 
suarez said she went public with her account at the urging of 
fellow members of the leftist revolutionary workers party and 
because my life is threatened anyway 
prochoice activists are hoping to rewrite the 1931 law that 
outlaws abortion except in the cases of rape or endangerment of the 
womans life 
i have been involved in the womens rights movement here in 
mexico for 15 years and ive only seen two cases where judges 
approved the abortions said heather dashner a revolutionary 
workers party activist 
the penalty for women who have illegal abortions is an automatic 
suspended sentence but doctors who perform them can lose their 
medical licenses 
federal deputy amalia garcia of the mexican socialist party plans 
to propose clarifying guidelines for legal abortions when congress 
reconvenes in the fall 
if there is enough public support garcia will propose legalizing 
all voluntary abortions the last such proposal made in 1979 
created an uproar before dying in committee 
i think mexico has changed garcia said there is more 
tolerance a more open way of thinking 
still she said a fight to legalize abortion would be tough 
both the catholic church and the vocal prolife group which 
oppose all abortions are powerful in mexico 
prolife leader serrano said he is ready for battle during an 
interview ap in his office serrano pointed to 7foothigh stacks of 
antiabortion petitions the group will begin circulating this summer 
by september prolife plans to present congress with the 
signatures of at least 5 million people opposing abortion he said 
some prochoice activists believe prolifes vocal antiabortion 
campaign fostered the climate that led to the arrests of suarez and 
the others 
rosario villalobos who accompanied suarez during her abortion 
and who also was arrested said that the week before serrano had 
called for a crackdown on abortion clinics 
i dont think it was a coincidence villalobos said but 
serrano denied any responsiblity for the arrests 
the newspapers said we were starting another inquisition 
serrano said although abortion is a crime we condemn the 
torture the physical aggression against the women 
a crackdown on clinics wont stop women from ending pregnancies 
federal deputy garcia said 
most women in mexico where an unskilled female worker makes 
about 350 a day cannot afford the 125 to 400 that clinics 
charge instead they perform their own abortions or seek help from 
a midwife nurse or friend 
mexican women fling themselves down stairs use coat hangers 
drink risky herbal brews or douche with cleaning chemicals they 
sometimes bleed to death afterward garcia said 
while the health department estimates the abortion rate at 10 
percent of 24 million pregancies annually a recently published 
government study estimated 700000 abortions are performed 
nationwide annually the estimate was drawn from a survey showing 
70000 women were treated for postabortion complications at social 
security hospitals in mexico city in one year 
the study which did not survey private hospitals and clinics 
indicated that women with abortionrelated complications are the 
third most common social security hospital patient it said six of 
every 100 such patients die 
although birth control was legalized in 1972 unwanted pregnancy 
is common many women dont use birth control because of ignorance 
or because they are ashamed to ask for it some live in rural areas 
where contraceptives are unavailable 
most women undergoing abortions have at least three children and 
cannot afford another garcia said 
or they need to work she said both public and private sector 
employers give female job applicants pregnancy tests pregnant 
applicants are turned away pregnant workers are fired 
lots of mexican women have abortions suarez said the only 
difference is that i talked about it

more than 15000 people work for congress enough 
to populate a mediumsized town thats almost 10 times the number 
of aides and clerical workers on the payroll 50 years ago has the 
congressional paper chase gotten out of hand thats the subject of 
considerable debate among political scientists and others who keep 
an eye on the hill

on new years day 1934 alice klopstad stepped 
off the train at washingtons union station a 22yearold shorthand 
whiz on her first trip away from her hometown of spink sd 
the next day she went to work as a secretary in room 452 of the 
senate office building one of fewer than 600 employees on the 
staffs of the 96 senators and their committees 
how that 600 has grown 
today about 4000 people work for 100 senators committees 
employ 1700 more the story in the house is similar in 1934 there 
were 992 employees in 1989 between members and committees there 
are 9683 
in all more than 15000 people work for congress enough for a 
mediumsized town 
one is alice klopstad andersen still deep in the congressional 
paper chase 55 years after she took her first dictation for south 
dakota democrat william j bulow since 1973 she has been the 
administrative assistant to rep carlos j moorhead rcalif 
now of course its so different mrs andersen says you 
think of a rural area and now its a metropolis its that 
different 
it sure is 
people worry about it political scientists write books about it 
some say the staffs have grown too big that all they do is help 
their bosses get reelected 
others disagree congress needs more staff they say because it 
has more work to do now 
as staffs have grown so has their work space 
the office alice andersen unlocks each morning shortly after 8 
am is room 2346 of the rayburn house office building one of three 
house office buildings and two annexes tourists encounter as 
they drive up the long slope of independence avenue to the south of 
the capitol on the northern or senate side are three senate 
office buildings 
by midafternoon mrs andersen has papers spread all around her 
snatching some from a chair so a visitor can sit she recalls that 
in 1934 she was one of four people on bulows washington staff he 
kept an office in south dakota to be sure but it was in his home 
in beresford 
her current employer moorhead has a staff of nine in 
washington plus two back home in glendale and three more in 
pasadena 
such district staffs are typical in 1959 roughly half the 
members of congress had fulltime yearround offices in their 
states or districts now all do usually more than one 
sens george mitchell dmaine and albert gore dtenn have 
eight home offices apiece sens donald riegle and carl levin both 
michigan democrats each has seven sen paul simon dill has 
four district offices staffed by 57 workers 
many congressional staff members both in washington and at home 
work on constituent services dealing with complaints about 
their boss stand on an issue answering questions about 
legislation helping voters penetrate the bureaucracies of the 
social security administration or the veterans administration for 
example 
others assist their bosses in dealing with the welter of 
legislation before them 
one recent day as the senate debated the budget resolution four 
senators were on the floor two aides flanked sen pete domenici 
rnm thrusting papers in front of him across the aisle sen 
james sasser dtenn conferred with two aides more than a dozen 
others sat on a red plush bench in the rear of the chamber 
or consider the role of staffs in melding divergent house and 
senate versions of legislation into one bill both houses can accept 
for example 
in room 2175 of the rayburn building where house and senate 
conferees are discussing the minimum wage bill sen edward m 
kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor committee leafs 
through the conference agenda 
it is my understanding he says that there has been 
agreement at the staff level and we do have recommendations on items 
2 3 8 10 11 12 13 14 and 16 it is my understanding we can 
just go through those or just move to adopt them if there is no 
further discussion 
there is none 
items 4 to 7 on the other hand deal with the subminimum 
training wage a key point of dispute between congressional 
democrats and the bush administration 
we have indicated they couldnt be part of a staff 
recommendation and would be decided by the members kennedy says 
after brief discussion the items are left in 
at that point kennedy and sen james jeffords rvt the only 
senators present must leave for a vote on the floor representing 
the senate side is left to john v harvey jr 33 chief labor 
counsel of the committee and a cluster of other staff members 
that brief meeting on may 2 was the culmination of weeks of staff 
work beginning when the bill passed the senate on april 12 
democratic and republican senate aides met separately to 
formulate their positions then all the senate aides got together 
there were similar meetings in the house then there were four 
meetings of aides with the members of the conference committee 
going through the agenda item by item making objections agreeing 
on changes 
after each preliminary meeting says one aide the staffs carried 
the changes to their bosses for approval the member is always 
involved in terms of final approval he says 
when the conference committee met says the aide who commented 
on the condition he not be identified it was really easy we 
didnt know until that moment that it was going to be easy 
mrs andersen reflecting on what staff members do says 
theres a volume of work i wouldnt think we needed all those 
people but she lets the thought trail off 
others are more blunt 
basically they will get as many staff members as they possibly 
can says mark liedl director of the congressional assessment 
project of the conservative heritage foundation as their power 
grows they are able to get into more and more mischief and i think 
having the staff is just another resource that allows them to

on the other hand christopher j deering an associate professor 
of political science at george washington university who specializes 
in the study of congress says the number of congressional staff 
members is hardly outrageous when you compare it to the size of 
the operation and the responsibilities that they have its really 
quite an appropriate staff level it seems to me 
still it is by far the largest staff of any legislative body in 
the world the canadian parliament which is second has an 
administrative staff of 1700 and an additional 1500 employees who 
work for members 
the swelling of congressional staffs from just over six per 
senator when mrs andersen arrived in washington to 40 or more today 
was sharply criticized in a 1980 book by michael j malbin then a 
research fellow at the conservativeleaning american enterprise 
institute 
in unelected representatives malbin wrote that the 
staggering growth in the number of aides has reinforced a 
situation in which the deliberative aspect of representation gets 
short shrift on all but the broad outlines the process no 
longer forces members to talk to each other to resolve the tough 
issues 
deering says members of congress range all the way from a 
member who is pretty much staffdriven to members who dont deal 
with their staffs at all 
rep norman d dicks dwash has seen the process from both 
sides before his election to the house in 1976 he served for three 
years as legislative assistant and later administrative assistant to 
the late sen warren magnuson 
in the house dicks finds there is more direct member 
involvement and interest than in the senate because the 435 
representatives are not spread as thinly among the committees as the 
100 senators are 
you hear some grousing in the cloakroom about how we have to go 
to conferences and the senators sometimes dont show up and youve 
got to deal with the staff of the senate he says he adds 
however that as a member of the house appropriations committee he 
has been impressed with the level of knowledge that the senate 
subcommittee chairmen have and you didnt feel that they were being 
led around by the staff 
i think frankly that the american people get a good return on 
the investment in congressional staff dicks says 
so do the members of congress he adds 
staff members can make or break you if they make mistakes and 
get you in trouble it can hurt you on the other hand if they do a 
good job it can do you an enormous amount of good its a big 
advantage for the incumbent 
indeed it is say critics and thats the rub 
if they are helping congress solve national problems then its 
good says the heritage foundations liedl if they are focusing 
more on doing activities that help their individual congressmen 
expand and keep power as in helping them get reelected then its 
disturbing 
dicks is by no means alone as a member of congress who graduated 
from being an aide to a lawmaker from his state 
house speaker thomas foley dwash worked for the late sen 
henry m jackson mitchell the senate majority leader worked for 
sen edmund muskie of maine nancy landon kassebaum rkan worked 
for sen james pearson 
congressional aides also move on to other jobs in washington a 
check of 58 biographical sketches of key government officials in the 
federal staff directory for 1988 showed that 10 of them had worked 
on capitol hill they included an assistant attorney general two 
assistant secretaries of state the director of an independent 
agency and members of three fulltime commissions 
like the senators and representatives they work for the staff 
aides get lobbied 
to be honest with you most of our nutsandbolts work is done 
with the staff members says jim magill legislative director of 
the veterans of foreign wars who sometimes makes his point with 
staff members over lunch he buys 
probably the most visible of our work is appearing before the 
various committees and subcommittees where we make our testimony 
but that usually is the final stage in a very long and drawnout 
process of working with the staff members and drafting legislation 
and also working with the staff members to get the member that they 
work for to offer amendments 
all in all says dicks the professional staff up here does a 
great job and they dont get paid very well 
some might disagree about the pay 
records of the clerk of the house show that mrs andersen was 
paid 50000 last year harvey the senate labor committee counsel 
made 52500 at 24 michael r bushman press secretary to rep 
terry bruce dill made 29000 
for some aides there is a fair amount of travel at the 
taxpayers expense 
the senates statement of disbursements for the six months that 
ended sept 30 showed for example that daryl h owen staff 
director of the senate energy committee ran up 8860 in expenses 
on a trip to moscow leningrad and kiev that joanne n paulk 
director of interparliamentary services in the secretary of the 
senates office was paid 3841 for a trip to london and geneva 
and that her assistant yvonne l hopkins got 3611 for travel to 
vienna prague warsaw and reykjavik 
james a miller in his book running in place about his 
experiences on the staff of former senate republican leader howard 
h baker jr said that in 1982 bakers chief foreign relations 
aide cran montgomery visited panama argentina chile peru and 
mexico in january saudi arabia lebanon jordan and israel in 
april and china and hong kong in may 
defenders of capitol hill staffs point to congress greater 
responsibilities these days both at home and abroad 
congress role has increased dramatically because of the great 
society programs our role in the world what have you says 
deering i dont think there is any question the size of 
government itself and government responsibilities expanded in the 
1960s 
it was a simpler capital when alice klopstad arrived that new 
years day 1934 
we were in washington about six months of the year and home 
about six months she says now everybodys here all the time

a recent poll in le monde showed that most french know only a 
little about the major events of their revolution numerous magazine 
articles and tv commentators make the point that the citizens are 
less enthusiastic about the bicentennial than the americans were 
about theirs in 1976 
the revolution that began as a neighborhood disturbance in the 
faubourg st antoine by the sansculottes artisans and shopkeepers 
who did not wear the fancy knee breeches of the aristocracy led to 
the declaration of rights of man and the citizen and the eventual 
overthrow of the monarchy but napoleon with his whiff of grape shot 
was waiting in the wings not an egalitarian representative 
government 
since the revolution france has been governed by five republics 
interspersed with two emperors three kings and a fascist marshal 
the goal of liberte egalite fraternite is still on the agenda of 
most political parties 
what is there to celebrate asks bernard laplaud of 
villeneuve les avignon it was a time of shame the revolution 
brought the terror and then napoleon who made france a lot of 
enemies 
laplaud a heating contractor was installing a new furnace in 
the penitentiary at marseilles when france last executed a criminal 
a pimp convicted of murder he recalls that the sentence was 
delayed for several hours because the ancient truck delivering the 
guillotine from paris broke down along the way

you can count the yearround population of 
this town on the fingers of one hand they are mark and sherri 
kepler and their three children 
in the summertime the four months of thaw in interior alaska 
the population swells to a grand total of maybe 30 these are gold 
miners drawn back as irresistibly as the migrating swallows they 
come to work their old mining claims to see anew the bedazzling 
flashes of yellow among the gravel in their gold pans 
the lure must be irresistible because even in summer flat has 
none of the amenities you might expect in any american village 
however small with a certified us post office not one store not 
one cash register not one telephone 
i am the federal presence here says mark kepler i am the 
postmaster here is the post office 
he shows proudly a oneroom building of about 10 feet by 15 
feet that he explains was once a liquor store he restored according 
to government specifications complete with a zip code and a flag 
i fly the flag by the rules he says i raise it at dawn 
which here in alaska happens in april and i take it down at sunset 
in september 
correction flat alaska does have a store it is padlocked but 
its goods are still on the shelves unsold the last sale was about 
1942 one of the unsold items is a brandnew dog sled 
it also has a bank likewise padlocked inside is a rolltop 
desk its pigeonholes full a green visor and sleeve garters in one 
drawer a locked vault with who knows what in it and a set of brass 
scales that weighed 17 million ounces of gold 
flat was one of this frontier states boomingest gold boom towns 
now frozen in time but still breathing 
its gravel streets and byways are strewn with carcasses of cars 
and trucks and mining debris dating from the 1930s when those 
people all left says kepler i guess it was too much trouble to 
take them out 
kepler a mechanic drives a 38 pickup truck he made to run like 
a jeweled watch from salvaged parts 
it would indeed have been at least as much trouble to take all 
that stuff out as it was to haul it in 
flat was named for nearby flat creek it might as easily have 
been named otter for another nearby creek or poorman for yet 
another although that would not over all have been accurate it 
is out in the wilderness 275 miles northwest of anchorage as the 
crow flies 
as the hungering miners found their way here when gold was 
discovered by a prospector named john beaton in 1908 the route was 
much longer 
it required riverboats up the kuskokwim river then up the 
iditarod river to a landing place then eight miles overland to the 
gold fields of flat 
a town of about 6000 sprang up at the landing place iditarod 
and the gold rush became known as the iditarod stampede nothing 
remains of iditarod only weathered skeletons of a few buildings 
one of them was tootsies a house of ill fame 
a bathtub from the collapsed rubble of tootsies now resides in 
the home of mark and sherri kepler at their home in flat which they 
built and furnished themselves 
isnt it something look at those clawed feet says mrs 
kepler if only it could talk 
john miscovich remembers tootsies 
in fact miscovich has a remarkable memory for every place and 
every excitement in flat since he was born here in 1918 in a cabin 
on otter creek 
he is the son of an ambitious immigrant who heard about the 
iditarod stampede got in on it worked for wages bought a claim 
and sent for his wife in yugoslavia john is the result 
he at 71 and his wife mary and any of their four grown 
children who can make it return to flat every summer with the 
swallows to take out of their now extensive land holdings whatever 
gold a momandpop operation as he calls it can yield 
in the early days we took 6000 ounces a year he says we 
dont even try for that now but its still worthwhile 
you bet gold appears daily in his sluice and two years ago he 
unearthed a 28ounce nugget at the going price of gold that alone 
is worth about 8000 
well says miscovich because its a nugget and not dust 
and it fits just right in the palm of your hand its probably worth 
at auction 10 times the price of gold some texan would pay that to 
make it into a belt buckle 
oh yes we still have it he says youre never broke if 
you have a little gold put aside 
but miscovich didnt make it only on gold working for his father 
as a boy he had to straddle like a horse a huge and heavy 
cannonlike hose nozzle used to bust up goldproducing earth with a 
highpressure stream of water it was hard work and dangerous he 
figured there must be a better way so he invented one and patented 
it 
if you have seen a fireboat at work or a ladder truck with a 
mounted nozzle you have seen miscovichs invention a water cannon 
with even higher pressure but small and safe and easy to aim i 
designed it for miners he says but it was firefighters who 
wanted it the most

miscovich left school in the 11th grade never went to college 
yet the knowledge of geology and mining he picked up on his own is 
so recognized that he has served for years in the winter months as a 
consultant to mining companies inspecting potential digging sites 
around the globe 
he could have made a fine living at that alone it isnt need or 
greed he says that draws him and his wife here every summer from 
their comfortable winter home in orange calif 
their home here is typical of an alaska mining camp it is small 
tinroofed its plumbing uncertain its dooryard cluttered with old 
wagon wheels moose antlers remains of mining equipment 
it doesnt have all the comforts he says but we actually 
look forward to coming back every year 
we like the isolation we like getting out and working with our 
hands if the ballgame on tv or the sunday paper or the movie 
house arent all that important to you you would understand 
the nowempty town also brings back vivid memories for miscovich 
he remembers the day wiley post crashlanded here in 1933 a 
snapshot of miscovich with the pioneer aviator hangs on his wall 
he remembers catching fish as a boy selling them to the miners 
to relieve their diet of moose steaks and of the excitement when a 
bear would wander into town 
he remembers the fourth of july bashes at the recreation hall 
that lasted three days the hall remains decorated with 48star 
flags and a fine upright piano the piano needs tuning 
and he remembers the great black bear gold robbery flats only 
recorded crime 
it was set up by the mail carrier who delivered the gold by dog 
sled 120000 worth and by a prostitute known as black bear her 
sister was called the cub and by her procurer 
they got caught the gold was recovered the mailman turned 
states evidence and went free the other two were tried in 
fairbanks the jury set them free too 
black bear and the procurer later made a fortune in bootlegging 
and went off to california to raise racehorses 
miscovich saw the boom end and flats terminal illness set in 
flat became inaccessible except by airplane the old iditarod road 
rendered impassable by neglect small operators couldnt meet the 
bottom line 
for excitement in flat today the biggest attraction would be 
mark keplers workshop 
it is truly a wondrous place machinery from another age still 
functions lathe drill press saw forge turned to life by a 
single motor and a dozen flapping belts 
this is where i spend most of my time he says its my 
playground anything busted kepler can fix 
the very isolation of flat not to mention all that abandoned 
machinery to play with was what prompted the keplers to buy one of 
its forsaken houses seven years ago to use for summer outings 
they lived in aniak a small village 75 miles southwest the 
closest place from here where people live he worked there as a 
commercial pilot and airplane mechanic kepler is 35 the two kepler 
boys are 12 and 9 and the girl is 2 
when the postmaster job opened up three years ago we decided to 
come out here and stay permanently to us this is paradise i have 
plenty to keep me busy 
what do you do in winter 
mostly cut wood 
wood fuels the kepler furnace and the kitchen stove a diesel 
generator provides electricity for the refrigerator but kerosene 
lamps serve for much of the lighting 
do the children like the life 
they love it the other day sherri and i were discussing the 
possibility of the post office closing down and us having to leave 
the boys said they would stay without us 
mrs kepler teaches the children by correspondence not unusual 
in the alaskan outback she uses books and lesson plans provided by 
the state she talks to a correspondence teacher twice a week by 
radio both boys test well above their grade level she says 
every three or four months mark cranks up his airplane and the 
keplers go shopping in anchorage they have their supplies mailed 
back which gives kepler a little business at the post office 
his other postal business is mainly forwarding mail in winter to 
the miners who keep flat as their permanent mailing address unlike 
miscovich who has a regular second home most of the others go off 
to various sunny places to spend their gold 
the mail plane arrives three times a week even if theres 
nothing to deliver 
flat happens to be on the way between other more populated mail 
drops and it isnt much trouble to make one more landing besides 
alaskans have a tradition of seeing to one another out in the bush 
especially during the dark harsh winter 
drop us a christmas card says kepler were always glad to 
hear from the outside 
five people there thats all their address is flat alaska

they are disadvantaged children given an 
advantage their parents didnt have a chance at the best education 
america has to offer this spring the first group of minority 
students to go through the prep for prep program collected college 
diplomas the next test is how they put their knowledge and skills 
to work 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the idea was planted 11 years ago by a public 
school teacher in the south bronx find gifted minority students 
give them some intensive instruction and place them in exclusive 
private schools 
this spring that idea bore fruit 
some of the finest universities in the country princeton 
northwestern pennsylvania oberlin gave degrees to 10 students 
from new york mostly from disadvantaged neighborhoods who entered 
the prep for prep program in 1978 as 11 and 12yearolds 
they go to private schools and colleges like princeton but 
they never forget where they came from says frankie cruz 22 who 
was in that first group of students i never forgot the south 
bronx and i hope to use my newly acquired skills to give something 
back to that community 
thats just how the founder gary simons pictured it 
what were really interested in is leadership development 
says simons 43 itll be another six or eight years before 
theyll get out into positions in society 
there are about 550 prep for prep students who will be attending 
the citys best private schools this fall another 150 from the 
programs early days will be in college 
more than 1700 of the most talented minority students in the 
city applied this year for only 150 spots 
its probably harder to get into prep than to get into 
harvard says sherry wang dean of the preparatory program 
those who make it will go from graffitiscarred numbered schools 
ps 121 ps 183 to independent schools with names such as 
fieldston dalton collegiate buckley 
they often travel from poor to affluent circumstances for the 
school day and they are suddenly surrounded by white kids 
i was leaving all my friends behind and i didnt know what 
private school would be like says lourdes sastre a 16yearold 
hispanic girl who just finished her junior year at nightingale 
school then later some of my friends would say youre acting 
white 
i lost a lot of friends that way says cherell carr a 
16yearold from brooklyn who is black and just finished her junior 
year at dalton on manhattans upper east side 
thats when i found out who my real friends are says miss 
sastre 
the core of the program is a 14month stretch of intensive 
instruction for public school fifth and sixthgraders to get them 
ready for the exclusive independent schools thats preparation for 
preparatory schools prep for prep 
you cant imagine how hard it really can be until you get into 
it says luanda williams an 11yearold who will move from the 
sixth grade at ps 121 in the bronx to trinity school on 
manhattans upper west side in the fall the first summer is the 
toughest you dont know whats going on 
her father franklin williams is a bus driver who grew up poor 
in jamaica he and his wife who would read nightly to their 
daughter knew prep for prep was the unmistakable knock of 
opportunity 
when i heard there was this opportunity to go to a better 
school i thought this could be a better chance in life 
franklin williams says its very hard but theres a challenge in 
everything nothing good is easy 
children accepted into prep for prep find themselves immersed in 
a rigorous summer program from 9 am to 4 pm five days a week 
they continue attending their public schools for the sixth grade 
but go to prep for prep classes every wednesday evening and all day 
saturday 
this is followed by another summer of special schooling after 
which they enter a private school prep for prep continues to track 
the students offering counseling and tutoring 
all of the students attending private schools get aid of some 
kind with more than threequarters of them on full or nearlyfull 
scholarships when it comes time to choose a college they are given 
assistance in applying for aid all of the students receive some 
college aid many getting full scholarships 
in 1987 a similar program called prep 9 was begun for 
ninthgrade students who go off to boarding schools 
prep for prep has a 19 million budget for its preparatory 
program counseling tutoring and administrative costs its covered 
by grants from foundations and corporations and gifts from 
individuals state and city money accounts for 2 percent of the 
budget 
about onequarter of those accepted into prep for prep drop out 
of the 14month program but 95 percent of those who are accepted 
into private schools complete their secondary education there 
this years 46 high school seniors are headed for among other 
places duke vassar massachusetts institute of technology 
stanford yale harvard and carnegie mellon university 
behind all of this is simons whose unassuming manner belies an 
ardent desire to change the world in a nutshell hes trying to 
produce leaders social political artistic scientific from the 
minority community

were looking at a society thats becoming increasingly 
pluralistic simons says my sense is that the old standby the 
american dream is very corny but very powerful it undergirds our 
collective consciousness 
but there is an enormous gap between the rhetoric of the 
american dream and the blemished reality 
simons himself attended public school albeit the rarefied halls 
of the bronx high school of science when i grew up i never 
realized there was another set of schools he says 
as a teacher of gifted students in the south bronx simons 
despaired of watching talented children languish in unchallenging 
sometimes chaotic public schools 
most of those kids get destroyed long before they get to the 
starting gate he says 
outside the classroom the environment would mow them down 
peer pressure there is a density of kids who dont have a sense of 
options and that reinforces the limitations 
the public school system doesnt meet the needs of the young 
people of the community ms wang says 
most of the children come from gifted programs or magnet 
schools but theyre still in very large classes they dont have 
the skills to compete at the collegiate level 
prep for prep grew out of simons field work toward a doctorate 
in gifted education he never got that degree work on the program 
swamped him he says but he succeeded in proving that one person 
can have an effect on peoples lives 
simons wants the prep for prep students to end up in positions 
where they can legitimately and effectively affect decisions 
from their own lives they may have a sense of how public 
policy most impacts those least able to influence it he says 
we want to inculcate a sense of social responsibility 
they tell us its not about social welfare its about social 
change youre capable people we need people in power who 
represent everybody said charles guerrero a 16yearold from 
the bronx who graduated from fieldston this spring and will attend 
harvard in september 
says frankie cruz who was one of simons students in the bronx 
for a selected few students he made the american dream possible 
you can say its idealistic but through hard work and the kind of 
commitment he demands he made it successful 
that commitment means 11 and 12yearolds who find their summers 
shot all for an intangible goal years in the future 
i didnt feel i was losing out on anything i felt i was 
gaining everything says angel colon a 12yearold from brooklyn 
who will switch from ps 250 to packer collegiate in the fall 
but the adjustment period was tough he says for example 
my best friend would always call me about his new comic books his 
new bike hed say he went to the pool friday he went to great 
adventure wednesday 
his mother damaris dumey recalled his saying when im small 
why make me give up my summer 
i feel the program has secured his future academically she 
says if it wasnt for this program he wouldnt be on his feet 
today because of the peer pressure 
luanda williams found the amount of work you get every night is 
overwhelming sometimes im up to 11 oclock i think if i make it 
through this ill go to one of the best schools and everything will 
work out 
sometimes the social adjustment is just as big 
one of the first things that happens is their speech patterns 
change they sound different says martha boyd a counselor who 
holds sessions for the children that cover everything from etiquette 
to drugs to getting along with rich white kids 
this bothers some children youre not sounding like youre 
supposed to she says their dress changes their values 
change their behavior changes we tell them change is all right 
its natural dont be afraid of it 
cherell carr found she enjoys dalton and the upper east side i 
like the fact that they learn from you as much as you learn from 
them they only know about themselves theyre learning about other 
cultures now 
i have a lot of friends back home who are very bright who 
could make it in college but are not on the right track says 
nicole atchison who came out of the bronx into prep for prep and 
on to cornell from which she graduated this spring 
they dont think they can make it they werent encouraged 
they dont think have enough money she says what prep for prep 
does is start you out on the right track

hes a selfstyled badboy bureaucrat 
decisive and outspoken a maverick fond of his adversaries a 
conservative aboard a motorcycle perry rivkind is in charge of the 
nations most volatile immigration district in dealing with 
haitians cubans nicaraguans and others flooding into miami he 
keeps his office door ajar and his phone lines open and runs his 
district like a benevolent despot

perry rivkind miamis immigration director who 
sometimes seems to be a branch of the us government unto himself 
angrily called a haitian exile leader about the sign someone erected 
outside the krome alien detention center 
it read reagans concentration camp 
does that bother you asked the rev gerard jeanjuste the 
exile leader 
he was assured in the strongest terms that the sign did bother 
rivkind a fervent admirer of ronald reagan and traditional american 
values albeit he sometimes dresses in black leather and zips around 
town on his motorcycle 
the next day the sign had been replaced 
the new one rivkinds concentration camp 
rivkind had to laugh when he called jeanjuste after that one 
jeanjuste was laughing too the priest who has been the outspoken 
leader of miamis haitians for a decade may not like rivkinds 
policies but he likes rivkind 
we are friends and enemies at the same time jeanjuste 
explains we tease each other and laugh together but when we are 
on business we are both devils 
for his part rivkind who recently rebuked jeanjuste publicly 
for calling him mr hitler promises to invite his friend gerry 
to his goingaway party when he retires later this year after 22 
years of federal government service 
the perry and gerry show the ongoing exchanges between two 
of miamis most public figures is symptomatic of the us 
immigration and naturalization service in miami in the six years 
since rivkind returned to his hometown from washington 
rivkind the selfstyled badboy bureaucrat is in charge of 
the nations most volatile immigration district in dealing with 
haitians cubans nicaraguans and others flooding into this 
immigrant city he keeps his office door ajar and his phone lines 
open and runs his district like a benevolent despot quite unlike 
the nations 34 other immigration districts 
i think perry rivkind has been a breath of fresh air says 
ira kurzban a miami attorney who recently filed the latest in 10 
years worth of lawsuits challenging us treatment of haitian 
immigrants 
the miami ins district office has for a long time been a 
hotbed says verne jervis chief ins spokesman in washington 
its such an international city there are an awful lot of forces 
at work there it takes a real juggling act to try to carry out the 
immigration law 
under rivkind jervis says the ins in miami probably has more 
support there than ever before his openness the access to his 
office are the highest theyve ever been a number of people here at 
ins headquarters certainly view him as a little bit of a maverick 
but if you can do that and maintain a semblance of control and order 
you can get away with it 
the 100000 or more haitians in the area detest us interdiction 
of haitians at sea and what they see as unfair and even racist 
treatment 
while they dont necessarily buy rivkinds explanation that hes 
simply upholding the law and defending the nations borders many 
haitians admire his gestures of humanity such as his 1984 order 
sending immigration officers to haiti to fetch a 9yearold haitian 
boy who was deported while rivkind was on vacation 
cubans who with more than 800000 in south florida constitute 
the largest cuban community anywhere except the city of havana have 
feted rivkind and admire his anticommunism the immigration 
director says that if he were president hed have the marines 
landing on fidel castros beaches tomorrow 
nicaraguans more than 100000 strong in south florida like 
rivkinds aversion to sending them back to what he considers a 
hostile sometimes brutal government and many in miamis other 
hispanic groups like rivkinds caudillostyle forceful 
personality and decisiveness 
rivkind the 59yearold son of russian immigrants loves his job 
the latest in a long series of federal positions a high school 
dropout he became a masters laureate korean war veteran and 
former miami beach hotelier vice cop and county police patrolman 
before becoming a career federal bureaucrat most of his 22 federal 
years have been in the justice department in various roles but he 
still recalls grimly a few months working in the pentagon which he 
found stifling

the worst thing about government is inertia congress it 
takes so long to get anything done the state department they 
analyze everything to death rivkind says 
not so with perry abbott rivkind 
with a dozen nicaraguans set for deportation three years ago 
rivkind refused to send them back to a cowardly communist 
government 
thus miami became the first immigration district to stop 
deporting nicaraguans while the ussupported contra rebels were 
fighting a guerrilla war 
rivkind today says he had been told the justice department 
planned to change the policy of course when attorney general edwin 
messe iii acted the policy already was a year old in miami 
jervis said rivkind may not always follow channels but his 
judgment has generally been pretty good 
rivkind who counts presidential son jeb bush among his close 
friends admits hes not a team player and unlike many bureaucratic 
colleagues doesnt spend a lot of time worrying about possible 
negative reactions to his decisions 
after so many years in government so many agencies so many 
experiences ive been to 75 countries under the nixon 
administration training foreign narcotics agents you dont react 
to events you handle them you make decisions with ease without 
overreacting without worrying 
some examples 
when two groups of young cubans came ashore three years ago 
rivkind immediately granted them asylum and brought them up to his 
11thfloor office for a news conference to talk about the terrible 
state of affairs under castro 
when everglades brush fires sent coarse smoke billowing across 
downtown miami in april most miamians closed their windows and 
complained rivkind closed the ins building then evacuated the 
krome detention center 
for a while he was telling television crews he was trying to 
hire enough buses to ship all of the more than 700 aliens 
threefourths of them haitian to texas ins centers that alarmed 
haitians in miami and surprised ins officials in texas after a 
night at miamis baseball stadium the aliens were back in krome 
when floridas lottery made a nicaraguan a millionaire recently 
questions were raised about his immigration status with the winner 
apparently in hiding rivkind granted him asylum 
rivkinds decisions can seem hasty to some given the national 
and international implications 
some people wondered whether the cubans had demonstrated a 
wellfounded fear of persecution as required for political asylum 
but rivkind said they certainly would be persecuted if they were 
returned to their perverted pathological government 
haitians who get here in dangerously overcrowded boats can be 
returned rivkind says because they dont face persecution at home 
in fact he believes the haitian government actively encourages 
haitians to go to the united states to get jobs for pay they can 
send home to relatives 
as for the nicaraguan lotto millionaire rivkind says he deserved 
asylum because of the persecution threat after all rivkind joked 
hes now a capitalist and the sandinista government persecutes 
capitalists 
the krome detention center a converted nike missile base on the 
edge of the everglades is a symbol of ins abuse to exile activists 
such as jeanjuste rivkind visits frequently eats lunch with the 
detainees at least once a week but says he is required by law to 
hold undocumented aliens there pending exclusion proceedings 
rivkind so managed to distance himself from the arrogant agency 
he works for that he was like the reagan of immigration the teflon 
ins man says robert boyer an attorney who presses nicaraguan 
immigration claims 
rivkind who claims unconvincingly to be surprised and flattered 
that a reporter wants to visit him is ready with a thick pile of 
newspaper clippings and even family scrapbooks featuring his late 
father sam a semipro basketball player and pioneering miami beach 
hotelier perrys older brother lawrence is a dade circuit court 
judge 
amid all the photos of rivkind with reagan bush nixon and 
others there hangs a framed photo of an idyllic scene a placid 
river lined with trees and mountains near roanoke va 
thats where hell be a year from now says the divorced father 
of two hell be relaxing enjoying retirement 
but hed like to do some college teaching and maybe hit the 
lecture circuit talking about immigration law and my favorite 
subject me he says laughing

the confederacys infamous andersonville prison 
camp in georgia marks its 125th anniversary this year so does the 
unions elmira prison in new york while andersonville remains a 
symbol of the inhumanities endured by prisoners in the civil war 
elmira and other northern prisons escaped that notoriety but there 
is little evidence that one was any better than the other 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
like some rusty bayonet or tattered battle 
flag hidden away in the attic the elmira prison camp is an 
allbutforgotten relic of the civil war 
considering the human suffering involved maybe memories of the 
prison which opened 125 years ago this month are best left 
undisturbed 
except for a flagpole a small monument and two stone markers 
theres nothing in the quiet elmira neighborhood where the prison 
camp once stood to mark its presence but buried beheath tidy rows 
of white headstones and shade trees at the woodlawn national 
cemetery are the remains of 2973 confederate soldiers who died at 
elmira many from starvation 
the confederacys andersonville prison in georgia is remembered 
as the most infamous example of the inhumanity and deprivations of 
the civil war even though records show that a soldier imprisoned in 
elmira stood little better chance of surviving than did one in 
andersonville 
questions linger over whether those 2973 rebels died mainly 
because of the primitive state of medicine and sanitation during the 
civil war or whether they were victims of the lincoln 
administrations retaliatory neglect of some prisoners of war 
can one say that by design this was a death camp asks j 
michael horigan an elmira history teacher who spent much of the 
last year researching records from civil war prison camps in 
washington dc and in the south i think one can say it but 
you cant document it the records on this camp are very incomplete 
but circumstantial evidence certainly makes it look that way 
union officials ordered in may 1864 that a complex of barracks at 
elmira that had been used for three years to house union soldiers be 
converted to a prison camp for captive southerners a 12foot high 
fence was immediately thrown around a 30acre portion of barracks 
there were 35 wooden buildings in the complex each about 100 
feet long and 16 feet wide union officers in elmira wrote the war 
department that the barracks could accommodate 3000 men comfortably 
and 1000 more in a pinch 
orders came back from washington that 10000 men were to be 
housed in the camp men not lucky enough to get places in barracks 
would sleep in tents wooden barracks werent constructed for all 
the men until well after winter had set in 
on july 6 1864 a train pulled into elmira with the first 
399man contingent of prisoners on board 
it was a ragged group of prisoners most had been captured during 
the grinding battles of the wilderness in virginia elmirans noted 
that their ragtag uniforms hardly made the men look like members of 
the same army some prisoners wore only shirts and underwear many 
had no shoes 
things went wrong at the prison camp almost from the beginning 
on july 15 a train loaded with 844 confederates and 128 union 
guards bound for elmira smashed headon with a coal train near 
shohola pa many of the wooden cars were reduced to kindling in the 
accident which killed 49 prisoners and 17 guards 
five prisoners escaped during the chaos and it took three days 
for some of the wounded to receive medical treatment 
meanwhile inside the camp a peril just as lethal though slower 
in its effect was taking shape 
a stagnant body of water called fosters pond was within the 
fences of the prison with so many men being sent to the camp 
there would be more than 4400 by the end of july 9600 by the end 
of august the water quickly became fouled the pond became a 
breeding ground of disease amid an extended heat wave that summer 
less than three weeks after elmira opened a local newspaper 
reported that a deleterious miasma hung over the camp due to the 
stagnant water one union surgeon called it a festering mass of 
corruption 
prison administrators asked the unions commissioner general of 
prisoners col william hoffman for permission to dig canals 
connecting the pond with the nearby chemung river to allow fresher 
water to pass through it 
approval for that project didnt come until october and 
prisoners didnt complete the canals until jan 1 1865 
i think this falls into the realm of circumstantial evidence 
horigan says this is what i call the politics of delay the 
sluice could have been done by august 1864 
in the meantime men were dying in droves 
the scurvy was among us and as the cold weather advanced the 
death rate increased rapidly wrote prisoner lb jones scurvy 
typhoid pneumonia and finally smallpox broke out to an alarming 
extent carrying off great numbers of the poor fellows

emory thomas a history professor at the university of georgia 
says doctors at elmira werent different from those practicing 
elsewhere during a war in which twice as many men died from disease 
than from battlerelated wounds 
the doctors really werent convinced about the germ theory of 
disease at this point he says at this time they were dealing 
with very very nutsandbolts things like how to set a fracture 
properly and whether chloroform would kill and if ether was better 
than chloroform these are important things but were not talking 
about great leaps forward in medical practice 
the food at elmira could have been another problem elmira 
prisoners after the war said a days rations generally included two 
1inchthick slices of bread 2 ounces of meat and a pint of soup 
often only the thin broth in which the meat was cooked union 
officers insisted after the war that rations at elmira were more 
generous 
i was assured by a guard that the same rations were issued to 
the prisoners as to the us troops stationed there confederate 
soldier erastus palmer recalled after the war there seemed to me 
to be some bad leak in it before it got to us 
in may 1864 secretary of war edwin stanton had ordered that 
prison rations to confederates being held in northern camps be 
reduced to the same level as those southern troops in the field were 
receiving this coincided with the lincoln administrations general 
hardening of its treatment of southern prisoners starting that year 
as news began to filter north of the deprivations being endured by 
union soldiers at andersonville the libby prison in richmond va 
and other confederate camps 
horigan calls stanton a very vindictive man who exercised 
virtual dictatorial control over the northern prison camp system 
abraham lincoln had very little to do with any decisionmaking 
as far as the prisoncamp system was concerned horigan says 
one of the characteristics of his presidency was that he relegated 
power to his cabinet members he gave them an enormous amount of 
power and an enormous amount of leeway 
many of elmiras prisoners blamed stanton too 
it is my honest opinion that secretary stanton did this in 
retaliation virginia soldier enos lyons later wrote of conditions 
at elmira yes men died in elmira prison i know from hunger and 
want this in a land of plenty i was young and strong and 
determined i would not be carried out if i could help it but many 
poor prisoners lay right down and died of hunger 
according to figures compiled by an earlycentury historian of 
the elmira prison clay holmes 27 percent of the camps captives 
died pulitzer prizewinning civil war historian james mcpherson 
places elmiras mortality rate at 24 percent 
by way of comparison 13000 or 29 percent of the 45000 union 
soldiers imprisoned at andersonville died 
for the civil war as a whole 155 percent of the union soldiers 
imprisoned in 28 southern camps died while in captivity and 12 
percent of the confederates in 24 northern camps died 
why then have elmira and other northern prisons with high death 
rates camp alton ill lookout point md johnsons island ohio 
and rock island ill escaped andersonvilles notoriety 
to the extent that elmira and others lack infamy i would guess 
it has to do with who won the war thomas says 
andersonvilles commandant henry wirz was the only soldier 
executed after the civil war as a war criminal an act that caused 
lingering resentment for decades among some southerners who claimed 
he was made a scapegoat for the mismanagement of prison camps on 
both sides 
and the only historic site operated by the national park service 
at a former civil war prison camp is at andersonville events 
including historic recreations memorial services and even an 
archaeological dig will be held throughout this year to mark 
andersonvilles 125th birthday 
but elmiras anniversary will pass quietly the chances are good 
that most of the people living in the wellmaintained 
turnofthecentury homes around the former site of the camp wont 
give the historic significance of this year a second thought 
a lot of people from around here a majority of people id 
say still dont know there was a prison camp in elmira decker 
says 
the people in the south know elmira horigan says they 
know their granddaddy was there or whatever and quite a few compare 
it to andersonville i dont think theyre correct in doing so 
nothing else was andersonville 
but why we only think of andersonville when we think of civil 
war prison camps i dont know these places were bad places all of 
them were it was despicable the way both the south and the union 
treated their prisoners it was the darkest chapter of the war

connecticut yankee mason adams sitting on the 
wooden deck of his california hillside home isnt speculating on 
the future of the nbc summer comedy series knight and daye 
im in suspended animation as far as doing any more knight and 
daye shows says adams who stars in the series with jack warden 
and hope lange we did six episodes well have to see how it 
plays it could come back as a midseason replacement but thats 
all speculation 
the show had a preview july 8 and is scheduled to begin its 
regular summer run july 12 
the comedy focuses on the oncefamous radio act of hank knight 
and everett daye adams is daye warden is knight and lange is 
dayes wife gloria 
knight and daye had split up 30 years earlier when knight made a 
play for dayes thengirlfriend gloria 
i was a news writer basically a journalist adams says of 
his character i got a job at this radio station where jack warden 
was a radio personality when the station manager saw our names 
knight and daye he put us together i was reluctant so what it 
evolved into was that we were constantly in confrontation 
when we get back together someone says hey theyre 
fighting and someone else says thats what they do when im 
asked about our breakup i say we had a profound disagreement 
actually he was making moves on my future wife 
adams whos lived mostly in connecticut for the past 30 years 
bought the house in bel aire when he came west to play managing 
editor charlie hume in lou grant 
we never sold it and its worked out very well i hate living 
in hotels he says he and his wife margot a writer also keep a 
home in new york city 
its the third television series for adams besides lou 
grant which ran from 197782 adams also starred in 
morningstar eveningstar which was on briefly in 1986 
but an older generation knows adams as pepper young in the 
longrunning radio soap opera pepper youngs family he was the 
third actor to play pepper taking over the role in 1945 and staying 
until it left the air in 1959 he also had regular roles in such 
radio series as big town and gasoline alley 
when i got out of college and went back home to new york city i 
decided to earn my living as an actor instead of as a teacher 
adams says radio was a good way for an actor to make money 
because you could also work in the theater but around 1960 radio 
passed away and many actors moved to los angeles 
i didnt want to move here permanently so i went into 
commercials i established a beachhead mostly doing voices i 
prefer not to be on camera i still do commercials for a lot of 
national and regional accounts 
adams mellow voice with a hint of a rasp is a familiar one 
behind commercials hes the one who says with a name like 
smuckers it has to be good 
adams was living in connecticut when the offer came from lou 
grant a spinoff of the mary tyler moore show starring edward 
asner allan burns cocreator of the show had seen adams in the 
deadliest season in which he played the mean owner of a hockey 
club 
id just taken a role in another world he says it was 
my first soap but the level of actors in it is terrific they were 
all broadway actors then i got the call about lou grant i was in 
a dilemma i flew out and met with the producers i wasnt legally 
bound to another world but i felt ethically bound they very 
graciously gave me my release 
adams says there has been talk of doing a lou grant movie 
but he doubts they could ever get all the people back together 
again i would certainly do it he says i think the idea of 
writing it is also daunting the feeling was that the show had a few 
more years left when cbs yanked it off the air so theres no great 
desire to go back 
asner who was involved in various liberal causes at the time 
has said cbs killed the show because his political positions were 
controversial 
adams says he likes playing the heavies in films in the tv movie 
under siege he was the lean and mean presidential 
assistant in the theatrical movie fx he was the corrupt 
government official 
playing the bad guys is fun he says in fx i was bad 
news a smooth and plausible guy a high honcho in the justice 
department who was as bent as he could possibly be id love to be 
offered another good part like that

john amos has worked as an advertising 
copywriter a standup comic a variety show writerperformer and 
even as a regular on mary tyler moores popular television sitcom in 
which he played gordy the weatherman 
but in his more than 20 years in and out of show business the 
broad powerfully built actor never appeared in a shakespearean 
play that changed recently with his portrayal of sir toby belch in 
twelfth night the opening production of the new york 
shakespeare festivals annual summer sojourn in central park 
and amos has found himself in a highpowered company of movie and 
theater names that includes jeff goldblum michelle pfeiffer mary 
elizabeth mastrantonio gregory hines stephen collins and fisher 
stevens 
the actor tried out for the role at the urging of james earl 
jones a veteran of the shakespearean repertory and one of the best 
othellos of recent years 
they were sitting in a trailer last year while working on the 
eddie murphy movie coming to america when jones told him if 
you dont try shakespeare it will just loom as a bigger and more 
insurmountable obstacle to you so you just might as well go ahead 
and take your best shot treat it as you would another play 
i had auditioned him before for another play and didnt give 
him the role recalls joseph papp head of the new york 
shakespeare festival but i thought gee hes an interesting 
actor with an imposing figure and good clear speech i told him 
you should look at shakespeares plays because there are many roles 
you could play 
after reading parts of twelfth night for papp and director 
harold guskin amos got the role of funloving highspirited sir 
toby 
my biggest concern was that i didnt develop an affected 
accent amos recounts 
amos born in newark nj didnt start out to be an actor his 
big dream was to play football but nothing came of it 
his acting career didnt get going until he moved to california 
my entree into show business came because of my writing during 
the day i was working for an advertising agency in los angeles at 
night i was moonlighting on a local television variety show called 
lohman and barkley as a writerperformer wed do 90 minutes of 
contemporary comedy and satirical bits 
out of that job came a position as a staff writer on the leslie 
uggams show a shortlived variety show on cbs in 1969 on it 
amos helped write what he calls a forerunner of todays situation 
comedies about middleclass blacks it was a 15minute segment 
called sugar hill in which miss uggams played the wife lincoln 
kilpatrick her husband and johnny brown her brother 
sugar hill taught me a great deal about the structure of 
situation comedy he says now so that later when i got 
involved in performing in a situation comedy i felt i had a slight 
edge on some of the other actors 
his job on the leslie uggams show won amos a role the 
following year on a new comedy series starring mary tyler moore his 
role of gordy the weatherman was his first national recognition 
amos had studied acting at a small theater in los angeles but he 
likes to think he honed his acting skills working as a standup 
comic in clubs in new yorks greenwich village in the late 60s 
i wasnt very good he says now but its the best training 
any actor can get particularly if you use your own material then 
you can gauge whether or not your perception of whats funny is 
funny to the general public 
amos lived in california for about 15 years before coming back to 
new york he was able to support himself by occasional television 
series like the tim conway comedy hour and future cop as 
well as commercials but he returned to the east coast and new 
jersey seven years ago to do more theater 
i had started to loose my hustle he says im not the kind 
of guy who can just lie by the pool waiting for my agent to call 
last year amos became artistic director and artistinresidence 
for a theater located in the grant avenue community center in 
plainfield nj after its mayor richard taylor asked him to do a 
few fundraisers 
he also staged the theaters first offering forever my 
darling a play by dan owens it takes place in the 1950s and 
concerns four black women who want to become the first female rhythm 
and blues singing group amos has even optioned the movie rights 
work on commercial projects like the upcoming sylvester stallone 
movie lockup gives amos the financial freedom to spend more 
with his fledgling theater 
i think im pretty much living the ideal life staying here in 
the east so i can be close to my theater doing i hope one 
picture a year and as much stage work as possible he says 
thats the best of both worlds

president najib spends most of his time 
these days trying to sweep away the image of a brutal repressive 
government hes even been saying neither he nor his close 
associates ever were marxists 
in his heavily guarded suite in the presidential palace najib is 
trying to build a new image not only for his government but also for 
himself repudiating almost everything about the 1978 revolution 
that installed a prosoviet regime in afghanistan 
he has been brushing off the marxist tag for himself and his 
associates on the ruling politburo ever since soviet troops withdrew 
in february 
he talks about subjects that once were taboo the big 
mistakes made before he assumed power in may 1986 halfbaked 
land and education reform policies launched by his predecessors in 
the early years of power 
during the past 11 years the revolution has traversed a 
difficult complicated and dangerous path with shortcomings haste 
and hurry he said in a recent interview with the associated 
press we have learned big lessons of history the passage of time 
is a great teacher 
since the last soviet troops withdrew feb 15 najib has adopted 
a position that at times sounds as though he would be willing to 
step down and leave his peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
with only a slim guarantee of existence 
although the party is communist in structure with a standard 
politburo central committee and youth organization it advocates a 
freemarket system and accepts the islamic religion its meetings 
begin with readings from the koran the islamic holy book and najib 
is a regular at friday prayers and often invokes the name of god in 
his speeches 
najib says he only seeks the 16th seat at the negotiating 
table with the seven moslem guerrilla groups based in pakistan and 
the eight in iran that are trying to topple his government 
he says hes ready to negotiate with the moslem guerrillas 
through intermediaries if necessary anywhere anytime and on any 
terms 
but the most extreme of the guerrilla leaders and their main 
supporters the united states and pakistan have taken the position 
that najib and key members of his government must go before they 
talk peace they contend the government trampled on ancient social 
and religious traditions and created chaos by opening the way for 
the soviet unions military intervention in december 1979 
some of the moslem guerrillas say they now would favor a 
negotiated settlement but the guerrilla governmentinexile formed 
in pakistan after the soviet withdrawal still insists najib must go 
even if it means more military action 
najib says he would resign but maintains that would not end the 
conflict which has already claimed more than 13 million lives 
destroyed thousands of villages and forced 5 million people 
onethird of the population into exile in pakistan and iran 
the departure of a personality or force will not solve 
afghanistans problems the 43yearold president said in the 
interview that can only be done by sitting down at the table and 
talking 
his appeals at times exhibit an air of desperation but most 
diplomats in kabul doubt his government is on the verge of military 
or political collapse on the contrary they say najibs departure 
could mean that any coalition government would not survive because 
neither members of his party nor the guerrilla leaders have his 
power and authority 
the government has been strengthened by a continuing soviet 
airlift of arms and ammunition the soviets have promised to stand 
by the najib government even though the supply costs are enormous 
believed to be about 2 billion a year 
najibs soldiers also have been strong and predictions that they 
would join the rebels and that the government would collapse after 
the soviet withdrawal have not proved true 
who is strong and who is weak najib said months have gone 
by and were still here and a year from now well still be here 
with the soviet troops gone afghans are looking to this summer 
as a season when the government and the guerrillas may finally talk 
peace they yearn for a political settlement that would end daily 
hardships 
long lines form daily outside bakeries and gasoline stations 
meat and vegetable prices have skyrocketed as high as 10 times last 
years inflation is running at 215 percent and wages have been 
frozen 
iran and china which also backed the guerrillas are moving 
toward supporting a negotiated settlement egypt and turkey have 
questioned washingtons policy on afghanistan the guerrillas they 
say lack the battlefield prowess to defeat the government troops 
and are so divided among themselves they would be unable to form a 
stable government 
but the united states which allocated an estimated 600 million 
in weapons and other aid to the rebels says the kabul government 
disqualified itself from talks about afghanistans future with the 
terror and destruction that was carried out at its behest 
rebel leaders claim at least 75000 people have been killed by 
khad the sovietstyle secret police since the marxists seized 
power april 27 1978 
najib a physician headed khad for six years before he was 
picked in may 1986 to succeed babrak karmal now believed to be 
living in the soviet union 
i see no reason to rehash the past najib replied when asked 
about khad george bush once headed a similar organization the 
central intelligence agency and now hes president of the united 
states 
but najibs government has started to speak about terror against 
its opponents 
so far most of the talk is confined to the first 20 months of 
the revolutionary regime in 197879 when najib was ambassador to 
iran power during that time was held by nur mohammad taraki who 
was smothered with a pillow in a party feud in september 1979 and 
whose successor hafizullah amin was assassinated shortly after the 
soviet troops arrived 
government officials say only about 1000 political prisoners 
remain in polecharki prison on the outskirts of kabul they say 
executions except those ordered by the courts have stopped 
diplomats from both eastern and western nations say they see no 
evidence that summary executions continue 
the guerrillas however contend afghanistan still holds 12000 
to 15000 political prisoners a figure accepted by the 
international committee for the red cross 
there have been improvements in the situation were not saying 
we never made mistakes says najmuddin kawyani a politburo member 
and secretary of the central committee 
prison is not a good thing for anyone said the 42yearold 
kawyani who was jailed briefly with najib for throwing stones at 
vice president spiro agnews car when he visited afghanistan in 1969 
and then for 16 months during amins reign 
however kawyani argues the guerrillas were equally as guilty of 
atrocities killing civil servants and government soldiers who tried 
to switch sides but were suspected of being informants 
why is the united states keeping mum on human rights violations 
by the mujahedeen he said

more and more moslem rebels are saying 
they would welcome a political solution to the 11yearold civil war 
in afghanistan 
we hope the battle for jalalabad is the last battle in 
afghanistan said massoud a writer for the afghan media resource 
center a prorebel news agency partially funded by the united 
states 
the rebels called mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors have 
fought government forces to a stalemate at jalalabad in eastern 
afghanistan since soviet troops ended more than nine years of 
involvement in the country feb 15 
casualties are estimated in the thousands making it one of the 
bloodiest battles of the war 
the most extreme of the moslem fundamentalist guerrilla leaders 
however want no part of a peace agreement that does not give power 
to their selfproclaimed interim afghan government a 
cabinetinexile composed of a sevenparty mujahedeen alliance with 
headquarters in this pakistani frontier city 
pakistan backs the rebels with help from the united states and 
shelters more than 3 million afghan war refugees 
critics of the guerrilla regime formed in february charge that 
it is not representative of the majority of afghans 
a large number of antigovernment afghans favor the return from 
exile of their former monarch king zahir shah to head a 
transitional administration that would guide the country to peace 
zahir shah was ousted in 1973 by the military which then 
established the republic that was overthrown by the marxists in 1978 
rasul sayyaf prime minister of the mujahedeen government and 
leader of the hardline ittehadiislami rebel party rails at 
proposals for a negotiated settlement 
it should be clear that any attempt to solve the afghan issue 
against the wishes and decisions of the mujahedeen will not only be 
futile but would also have negative repercussions on afghanistan and 
the region as a whole he said in a statement issued from his 
peshawar office 
if the world community wants to end bloodshed in afghanistan 
they should put pressure on the russians to stop propping up a 
regime which is totally unacceptable to the afghan nation 
some rebel leaders say they are stockpiling weapons and planning 
attacks on kabul the afghan capital and other key cities 
the guerrilla offensives that usually herald winters end havent 
happened this year except for the attempt to take jalalabad 
no one wants to fight said massoud who uses only one name 
everyone wants a peaceful solution zahir shah does have 
popularity as opposed to rebel leaders who want a military 
solution 
but one afghan intellectual who asked not to be identified said 
an alternative to zahir shah would be to have afghan politicians who 
belonged to earlier noncommunist cabinets take over until 
elections monitored by the united nations can be held

here is a chronology of the supreme courts 
major abortion decisions 
jan 22 1973 in roe vs wade the court for the first time 
legalized abortion nationwide the court in an opinion by justice 
harry a blackmun based its 72 ruling on a womans constitutional 
right to privacy 
the court said a womans decision to have an abortion during the 
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor 
it said states may impose certain regulations during the second 
trimester to protect the womans health and may take steps to 
protect fetal life in the third trimester state authority to 
regulate abortions after the first trimester was not made absolute 
however 
jan 22 1973 in roe vs bolton the court that same day struck 
down by a 72 vote restrictions on facilities that could be used to 
perform abortions the decision gave rise to a new kind of medical 
facility the abortion clinic 
july 1 1976 in planned parenthood vs danforth the court by 
a 63 vote said states cannot give husbands veto power over their 
pregnant wives decision to abort their pregnancies by a 54 vote 
the court said that neither can parents of minor unwed girls be 
given an absolute veto over abortions 
june 20 1977 in maher vs roe the court ruled 63 that states 
have no legal obligation to pay for nontherapeutic abortions 
jan 9 1979 in colautti vs franklin reached by a 63 vote 
the court reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion 
in determining the timing of fetal viability when a fetus can 
live outside the mothers womb the justices said states may seek to 
protect a fetus that has reached viability but the determination is 
up to doctors not courts or legislatures 
july 2 1979 in bellotti vs baird the court by an 81 vote 
elaborated on its parental consent decision of 1976 it implied that 
states may be able to require a pregnant unmarried minor to obtain 
parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides an 
alternative procedure to parental approval such as letting the 
minor seek a state judges approval instead 
june 30 1980 in harris vs mcrae the socalled hyde amendment 
was upheld by a 54 vote the court said the federal government and 
individual states are under no legal obligation to pay for even 
medically necessary abortions sought by women receiving welfare 
march 23 1981 in hl vs matheson the court ruled by a 63 
vote that states may require doctors consulted by some girls those 
still dependent on their parents and too immature to decide such 
matters for themselves to try to inform parents before performing 
a requested abortion 
june 15 1983 in three decisions called city of akron vs akron 
center for reproductive health planned parenthood of kansas city 
vs ashcroft and simopolous vs virginia the court in a 63 
ruling said states and local communities may not require that all 
abortions for women more than three months pregnant be performed in 
a hospital 
the court also struck down regulations that among other things 
imposed a 24hour waiting period between the signing of an abortion 
consent form and the medical procedure and required doctors to tell 
women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a human life 
june 11 1986 in thornburgh vs american college of 
obstetricians and gynecologists the court voted 54 to strike down 
pennsylvania abortion regulations somewhat similar to those it 
invalidated in 1983 the court said states may not require doctors 
to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and about 
available medical assistance benefits for prenatal care and 
childbirth 
in that decision the court also struck down requirements that 
doctors performing thirdtrimester abortions which are rare use 
procedures least risky to a fetus capable of surviving outside the 
womb and that two doctors always be present for abortions performed 
in the third trimester also invalidated was a regulation requiring 
doctors to make a record which could become available to the 
public of every abortion they perform 
dec 14 1987 in hartigan vs zbaraz the court split 44 the 
effect was to invalidate an illinois law that could have made 
abortions more difficult to obtain for some teenagers 
the decision was announced two months before justice anthony m 
kennedy joined the court and replaced justice lewis f powell who 
had retired the previous june

missouris abortion statute quickly 
drew a legal attack after it passed in 1986 and a federal court 
blocked its implementation even before it took effect 
that was what supporters wanted the law was passed with the 
intention of making it a vehicle for challenging the us supreme 
courts roe vs wade decision of 1973 which legalized abortions 
the missouri case drew national attention and a flood of briefs 
for and against abortion poured into the supreme court which heard 
arguments on the issue last april 
the law drafted with the help of the missouri catholic 
conference was the missouri legislatures third effort to restrict 
abortions since the 1973 decision parts of a 1974 law enacted to 
get around roe vs wade were overturned by the supreme court in 
1976 another law requiring that abortions during the fourth to 
sixth months of pregnancy be conducted in hospitals was overturned 
in 1983 
the legislature voted overwhelmingly to pass the latest law 
which restricted the availability of abortions and defined life as 
beginning at conception 
state rep jim barnes a democrat who was one of the laws 
sponsors said legislators intentionally passed a measure that would 
be challenged so that the abortion issue could be reviewed by the 
current supreme court seen as more conservative than the one that 
decided roe vs wade 
republican gov john ashcroft a strong abortion opponent signed 
the bill which was to have taken effect aug 13 1986 but 
reproductive health services of st louis planned parenthood of 
greater kansas city and others filed suit in july in us district 
court in kansas city seeking to overturn the law 
on july 31 1986 us district judge scott wright ordered the 
state not to enforce the statute until the lawsuit could be heard a 
fourday trial was held the following december 
the case became known as webster vs reproductive health 
services after one of the plaintiffs and missouri attorney 
general william webster 
wright struck down major portions of the law in march 1987 and 
the state appealed to the 8th us circuit court of appeals in st 
louis the appeals court struck down most of the law last july 
saying it conflicted with roe vs wade 
in addition to declaring that human life begins at conception 
the law said no public funds employees or facilities could be used 
to perform or assist in an abortion or to counsel a woman to have an 
abortion 
the appeals court upheld a provision in the law banning the use 
of taxpayer money for performing or assisting an abortion but it 
ruled use of a public facility or the services of a public employee 
could not be banned if all such costs were reimbursed by a patient 
the appeals court also threw out the definition of life beginning 
at conception saying it was unconstitutional for a state to adopt 
one theory of when human life begins 
among the record 78 friendofthe court briefs filed with the 
supreme court was one signed by 127 missouri lawmakers asking the 
justices to uphold the states law and allow each state to determine 
what its abortion laws should be 
according to that brief missouri passed its first abortion law 
in 1825 and from 1835 until 1973 the state prohibited abortions 
except when necessary to save the mothers life 
the missouri department of health says 17382 abortions were 
performed statewide last year 17574 in 1987 19039 in 1986 and 
19482 in 1985 it says all the abortions were performed in private 
facilities

throughout the 1980s about 15 million 
abortions have been performed on american women each year according 
to a private survey 
the number climbed steadily after the 1973 supreme court decision 
legalizing abortion from about 750000 to more than a million by 
1976 the survey showed 
who are the women seeking and obtaining abortions the following 
statistics have been reported by the alan guttmacher institute a 
new yorkbased organization that studies reproductive issues

computers oil wells and children 
scurrying with school bags have replaced assault rifles rubble and 
teenage combat soldiers in chad a nation that has seen little but 
strife and war since independence from france in 1960 
with the guns silent since 1987 except for a few lingering 
skirmishes the central african nation has begun to tackle the 
monumental problems of economic survival and development 
until very recently international and bilateral aid programs 
were here to distribute emergency food to relieve hunger and counter 
other effects of guerrilla war and conflict with neighboring libya 
as well as a disastrous drought in 1984 now they are here to extend 
aid for longterm economic recovery 
the computers incongruous in a country where 85 percent of the 
estimated 5 million people are subsistence farmers and less than a 
quarter of all children attend school are playing an essential role 
a senior official for the us agency for international 
development usaid said the computers gather the information that 
allows the most effective allocation of resources 
computer programmers funded by the us bureau of census and 
usaid for example plan to help the government of president hissene 
habre conduct the nations first census next year 
the united states gave 1857 million in bilateral economic aid 
to chad this year while all foreign assistance in 1987 amounted to 
200 million much of the aid helped the government pay operating 
costs and salaries of civil servants teachers and public officials 
gueralbaye koumadoum a 37yearold secondary school teacher who 
worked without pay in the worst years of the war and its aftermath 
began to receive his full monthly salary the equivalent of 368 in 
january 
things are much better now he said but many students 
cant afford things like paper and pens and owning a book is a real 
luxury 
just for shared textbooks parents must pay 8 a month for each 
primary school child and 16 for every secondary school student 
a landlocked country that has long been an eastwest crossroads 
in the heart of africa chad is classified by the world bank as one 
of the worlds 10 poorest nations its annual per capita income is 
125 
when the bottom dropped out of the world cotton market four years 
ago chad the largest producer of cotton in west and central 
africa lost nearly half its normal foreign currency revenue 
one bright spot now is oil with reports that two wells have 
begun limited production neither the government nor representatives 
of esso which operates a concession north of lake chad would 
confirm or deny the reports 
a world bankfinanced microrefinery is expected to produce most 
of the petroleum the country needs by the early 1990s 
enough petroleum to meet almost 50 percent of chads needs is now 
smuggled from neighboring nigeria the remainder imported through 
legal channels 
france the single most important donor this year provided chad 
with 833 million in budgetary support technical assistance and 
development and military aid 
according to figures from private french sources chad has only 
13000 salaried employees about 7000 houses and offices are hooked 
up to electric power lines and 10000 have water meters 
ten percent of the governments current 835million budget 
comes from taxes levied on the sale of gala beer one of the 
countrys leading manufactured products 
despite the monetary poverty the towns and villages of chad do 
not seem mired in the misery that characterizes many other african 
cities 
i know its a contradiction said diego berriot a world 
health organization representative but although chad is among the 
poorest of the african countries the life is not nearly as 
miserable as elsewhere on the continent 
government figures indicate this years harvest of cereal grains 
including mainstays millet and sorghum will reach 800000 tons 
about enough to make chad selfsufficient in food president habre 
said in a june 7 speech marking his seventh year in power 
the world bank which has provided 156 million in aid since 
1984 says in its latest report that the overwhelming impression 
is that chadian entrepreneurs have a wealth of ideas and dynamic 
entrepreneurial spirit but are severely hampered by a shortage of 
capital and technology 
since 1982 when habre defeated rival armed factions and declared 
himself head of state much of chads foreign aid has been in grants 
or nearly interestfree loans 
in 1979 civil war broke out among the 11 groups that made up the 
shaky government of national union this was complicated in late 
1980 by the incursion of libyan troops on the side of goukouni 
oueddei habres chief rival for power and one of the major 
belligerants 
the libyans withdrew suddenly in november 1981 leaving goukouni 
seriously weakened in june 1982 habres forces entered ndjamena 
bringing the main war to an end 
but sporadic fighting among rebellious army units continued in 
the south until early 1985 and goukounis libyanbacked forces in 
north finally were defeated in july 1987 with the help of french 
ground and air forces sent to chad in 1983

reports still crop up periodically however of skirmishes 
between government troops and what are described as rebels 
on april 13 the government announced it had put down a rebellion 
and that three prominent members of habres administration had fled 
information minister adoum moussa seif said in a recent interview 
that the april 12 incident occurred when the government uncovered a 
scheme to smuggle arms to libyanbacked rebels based in western 
sudan 
londonbased amnesty international issued a report june 22 saying 
that at least 100 people arrested in the incident may face torture 
and illegal execution 
moussa seif said a number of people were taken in for 
questioning but added that he believed most had been released 
chadians still wonder how long it will be before their future can 
be unlinked from the plans of col moammar gadhafi the libyan 
leader 
since gadhafi came to power 20 years ago libya has been enmeshed 
in chads internal affairs supporting a rainbow of antigovernment 
factions and tendencies over the years 
a us state department publication on aid to chad says 7000 
libyan troops remain in the aouzou strip a 45600squaremile area 
between the two countries occupied by libya since 1973 the 
publication adds that chads continued resistence to libyan 
aggression helps contain libyas expansionist ambitions curb its 
aggression and terrorism and reduce libyan prestige and influence in 
subsaharan africa 
chad is strategically situated between libya to the north and 
zaire to the south and between nigeria in the west and sudan in the 
east 
the united states which has backed habre ever since libya sent 
troops into chad in 1980 furnishes military aid to chad and chadian 
military personnel train in the united states 
meanwhile habre says a committee of leading chadians was 
putting the finishing touches on a draft constitution that he hoped 
would be put to a vote before the end of the year the document he 
added would provide a more solid basis for democratic rights in 
chad 
despite economic problems some chadians are optimistic 
among them are abdel hamid a 20yearold shepherd and his 
grandmother fatima who look forward to the paving of a road 
running out of ndjamena 
the house from which they make their living selling goat cheese 
is on the road 12 miles northwest of the capital 
theres no point in moving to town to sell because then people 
wont think our cheese is fresh hamid said so when the road is 
done people can come to us all year round and not worry about the 
rains 
even in ndjamena the streets turn to mud in the rainy season 
health is another area where international aid has come into play 
dr issaline greindl a belgian specialist in tropical medicine 
is using computers in a harvard universitysponsored project to 
identify chads major health problems and allocate resources 
in 1985 no one even knew how many health facilities there were 
in the country she said but now we are receiving about 310 
standardized reports a month which represents about 90 percent of 
the facilities 
chads basic health problems are fevers including malaria 
respiratory problems and diarrhea either avoidable or treatable 
with minimum infrastructure and medication 
the average life expectancy still is in the mid30s but in 
statistical health reports anyone who survives past the age of 5 is 
considered an adult

true believer rcacolumbia home video vhsbeta 8995 
rated r 
 
true believer is fun to watch unfortunately it is not 
believable 
james woods plays with his trademark intensity eddie dodd a 
pioneering civil rights lawyer who lost his 1960s spirit on the way 
to the 80s he finds himself defending mostly drug dealers and 
defending himself for doing so 
along comes a young lawyer roger robert downey jr who 
worships dodds earlier work and an 8yearold murder case in which 
the defendant might actually be innocent dodd is reluctant to take 
the case and roger sneers it was close huh we almost defended 
someone who wasnt a drug dealer 
but dodd plunges into the case and he also finds hes fighting 
public corruption and various urban evils 
the problem with the movie directed by joseph ruben is that 
instead of taking a close look at dodds disillusionment or at the 
relationship between dodd and roger true believer takes the 
easy way out and goes for the thrills 
for starters the old murder is recreated dodd is beaten up by a 
phony white supremacist and theres a crazy and dangerous chase 
through a plumbing supply factory on the good side the ending is 
clever 
downey is fine as is yuji okumoto playing the convict and

the midnight hour vidmark vhsbeta 8995 
 
the midnight hour is a good little vampire witches and 
ghouls tale starring shari belafonteharper as a witch who brings 
terror to a small town on halloween 
although there are recognizable names in the movie the acting 
leaves much to be desired costarring are levar burton lee 
montgomery dick van patten kevin mccarthy jonelle allen dedee 
pfeifer and cindy morgan 
and for a horror flick the chills are as lacking as the thespian 
skills 
nonetheless it is still an enjoyable romp as the the towns 
cemetery residents climb out of their graves and munch rip and 
mutilate their way through the night joining trickortreaters and 
crashing a halloween party 
the game then becomes how to get the baddies back in the grave 
and the townsfolk back to normal along the way there are a few 
chuckles 
and despite all its flaws the midnight hour is an adequate 
little horror flick for a rainy saturday afternoon

the telluride sessions mca strength in numbers 
 
innovation and bluegrass are uneasy companions but the allstar 
band strength in numbers is proof that the banjo dobro bass 
fiddle and mandolin can break new ground 
the telluride sessions combines bluegrass instrumentation 
with new age melodies and classicalmusic arrangements and the 
result is a pleasure to hear 
these guys arent just any pickers sam bush on mandolin and bela 
fleck on banjo are members of the new grass revival one of the best 
progressive bluegrass bands mark oconnor on fiddle guitar and 
mandolin jerry douglas dobro and edgar meyer bass are also 
terrific instrumentalists 
but for their first record together these inventive virtuosos 
decided to emphasize ensemble playing rather than solos themes are 
developed by unusual instrumental combinations two violins and a 
bowed bass for example on the beautiful one winters night 
counterpoint and dynamics rarely important in bluegrass music are 
explored to great effect the band has a lot of fun with 
syncopation too 
the telluride sessions isnt without dazzling solos oconnor 
on guitar and fleck play with breathless speed on slopes 
oconnor and bush stage a mandolin duel on macedonia 
but the star of record may be its most unheralded participant 
meyer performs tricks on the bass that will leave listeners shaking 
their head and he had a hand in most of the strongest compositions 
including the goodhumored pink flamingos and the pensive no

agnes varda compares filmmaking to cutting open 
an apple and seeing whats inside she likes to find fresh ways to 
examine everyday life 
one of the most influential directors of the french new wave the 
61yearold varda has depicted a young carpenter torn between two 
women happiness a drifter amidst the peasants and bums of 
south france vagabond and the friendship of two women over 15 
years one sings the other doesnt 
sometimes her films are broad in scope salut les cubains 
salute the cubans is a 1963 documentary of the cuban 
revolution and the black panthers examines the radical 1960s 
organization 
in cleo from 5 to 7 a pseudodocumentary of two hours in the 
life of a glamorous pop singer who may have cancer she focuses on 
the tiniest details 
her new film kung fu master is a different view altogether 
a love triangle involving a 15yearold boy a 40yearold woman and 
a brand new video game the idea was suggested to varda by her 
friend jane birkin who stars as 40yearold mary jane 
do you know how love begins between people between human 
beings varda asked love is made up of a series of bad or good 
reasons which come to a point 
maybe shes lonely at the time shes had two husbands maybe 
she likes the boy as a mother maybe nobodys looking at her and 
that little boy looks at her maybe she wants to go back to her own 
adolescence there are many reasons at that moment of her life 
birkin is married to the french director jacques demy and their 
son mathieu portrays the young boy whose interest in mary jane is 
balanced by his passion for the kung fu master video game 
its the last days of a child varda said the last months 
of being not yet a man the feeling that its coming and its not 
yet there theres a real frustration at that age they want so much 
to be men and its not yet here 
varda was born in ixelles a suburb of brussels and went to 
paris after world war ii to pursue classical studies at the lycee 
victorduruy courses at the ecole du louvre stimulated her interest 
in painting and sculpture and she also took night classes at the 
vaugirard school of photography 
in 1951 she was appointed official photographer of the theatre 
national populaire and remained in that position for the next 
decade 
during that time she made her debut film though varda had no 
interest in film as a child she remembered having a head full of 
movie images and decided to write a scenario she rented a house 
on the coast and filmed la pointe courte released in 1955 
the film took its title from a fishing village to which a young 
man and his parisian wife return hoping to save their marriage 
varda contrasted the young couples story with the local villagers 
struggle to survive eventually linking the two seemingly disparate 
ways of life 
she deliberately used a real fishing village wanting to give the 
film the look of a documentary ive always been using reality as 
a texture to understand better i like for stories to look true 
although a failure at the box office la pointe courte was a 
major influence on other french directors notably alain resnais 
who edited the movie and cited it as an influence on his 1959 
classic hiroshima mon amour 
she made several documentary shorts but inadequate funds 
prevented varda from making her next feature cleo from 5 to 7 
until 1961 
backed by french businessman georges de beauregard who had 
supported jeanluc godards breathless the film studied cleos 
evolvement from a shallow pop star to an authentic human being 
capable of understanding pain in herself and others 
cleo was again praised by critics and was a commercial 
success as well building anticipation for happiness which won 
the silver bear award at the 1965 berlin festival and used mozart 
for background music 
im full of cliches like everybody the filmmaker said i 
used mozarts music because he gives me that feeling of happiness 
and death its never intellectual i just feel strongly about it 
her biggest success since came in 1985 with vagabond which 
earned raves for young sandrine bonnaire who played the title role 
vagabond like much of vardas best work managed to fund 
humor and hope in even the grimmest aspects of life 
ill never be a bum i hope but i could be near them enough so 
i can speak to them and let them express feelings of anger and put 
them in the film varda said its not a documentary but i 
could approach them enough to not betray them not make them 
ridiculous or too much to take just show what they are 
she bonnaire is a survivor not a victim life is varied it 
cant be totally sad

museums of the future will have to draw 
more on walt disney than the renaissance if they are to attract 
visitors ensure sources of funding and survive competition from 
theme parks 
museums must change from selfcentered to clientcentered 
environments says george f macdonald director of the canadian 
museum of civilization they must market themselves not only as 
educational but also as meaningful leisuretime activity 
macdonald was one of half a dozen experts who spoke at a recent 
symposium on museums sponsored by the caixa de pensions foundation 
and the cultural olympics part of the 1992 summer olympics 
organized by the city of barcelona 
people already spend more time on visits to theme parks than on 
trips to museums an average of eight hours as compared to 50 
minutes according to statistics provided at the symposium 
but interest in museums appears to be on the increase said 
kenneth hudson director of the european museum of the year award 
he added however that government and foundation funding on which 
so many museums depend is shrinking as public budgets are tightened 
and costs rise forcing them to become more selfsupporting 
museums of the future will have to borrow techniques from the 
successful theme parks such as extensive sensory stimulation through 
lights graphics and color as well as live performances constant 
change and updating of attractions film presentations on giant 
screens and attractive boutiques selling related merchandise 
but museums need not sacrifice their traditional role of 
educating and providing wellresearched and accurate information 
macdonald said when improving on attention to the needs and 
interests of their visitors 
many museum curators would put up enormous resistance to such 
changes he acknowledged 
they have comfortable niches there and they dont like the 
earth trembling under their feet macdonald said but i think 
the future is equally bleak if they dont respond because their 
funding will shrink every year and eventually theyll be running 
empty museums with no operating budget 
margaret j king a specialist in american popular culture at 
philadelphias thomas jefferson university said part of the change 
will require museums to fuse popular culture with the elite culture 
that has been their traditional domain 
in order to attract visitors inside the experts said museums of 
the future will have to offer greatly expanded leisure facilities 
such as fullservice restaurants theaters conference facilities 
and reception rooms big enough to accommodate weddings or perfume 
and other marketing launches 
and they will have to be visually exciting and welcoming rather 
than monumental and intimidating 
visitors reared on television will be more readily drawn to 
exhibits where information is displayed on tv screens than on 
printed labels and videocomputer hookups will be used to allow 
museumgoers to request additional information that is specifically 
suited to their interests 
because visitors will be able to control the information museums 
will be able to present several interpretations of an exhibit or 
object permitting the viewer to come to his or her own conclusions 
science museums maritime museums and museums of human 
civilization have been among the first to make use of theme park 
techniques 
at barcelonas maritime museum housed in the 14th century royal 
shipyards building on the mediterranean waterfront the 180 symposim 
participants were able to see some of the principles of the modern 
museum put into practice 
for example the recent remodeling is concentrating on 
highlighting valuable but poorly lighted exhibits such as the 
lifesize replica of the juan de austria spains flagship in the 
1517 battle of lepanto with halogen focus lamps or fluorescent 
strip lighting that draws the visitor closer to the objects 
the threeyearold city of science and industry in paris la 
villette neighborhood was billed by its president roger lesgards as 
a cultural enterprise offering the visitor the opportunity to 
simulate flying an airbus jet watch a living fetus as it develops 
or climb inside the ariane rocket 
if this fails to hold ones interest the visitor can stroll the 
136 acres of park surrounding the museum visit one of the four bars 
or three shops change money at the bank play the 
discoverythroughplay inventorium for children or do some research 
with 190000 reference works 
but directors and curators of fine and decorative arts museums 
have been slower to welcome the disneylike atmosphere into their 
marble halls 
art museums still contrive to make visitors feel that they are 
studying for an examination or should be said hudson who is no 
friend of theme parks he believes the museum of the future will 
have to become a grassroots social center where the atmosphere 
surrounding the objects may be more important than the objects 
themselves 
in macdonalds view the art museum of the future will have to 
pay more attention to creating a context for the art and to 
revealing the codes of meaning contained in the work of many 
artists especially contemporary ones 
one of the most effective ways of doing that is to have 
presentations that look through the eyes of the artist he said 
ernest j hugh de samper senior director of government and media 
relations for colonial williamsburg said most museum people resent 
the theme park as an interloper 
for them the real thing is the real thing he said but 
like detente it the theme park must be recognized we must adapt 
our activities to make the best of our assets while keeping up with 
the competition

in the late 1970s donna summer ruled as disco 
queen of the music world but she turned in her tiara once 
breakdancing outhustled the hustle 
summer made headlines in 1980 by signing with the newlyformed 
geffen record label whose founder david geffen had successfully 
promoted jackson browne the eagles and joni mitchell 
it seemed like a perfect match summer was coming off a 
phenomenal string of hit singles including bad girls on the 
radio and hot stuff geffen was a widely respected executive 
browne still thanks him on each of his records who also signed 
elton john neil young and john lennon 
but something went wrong many of the big names soon became 
unhappy and left summers first record for geffen the 
wanderer went gold but her sales later fell off by the 
mid80s she was seeking her release from the label 
it wasnt working she recalled in a recent interview it 
wasnt that we hated each other it just wasnt working they didnt 
really have the facilities to promote someone like me it was 
frustrating 
her major success of the decade came in 1983 with the album 
she works hard for the money the title track was a top 10 
smash an anthem for working women unconditional love a 
collaboration with the reggae group musical youth was also a major 
hit 
the record came out on polygram 
summer had flops as well cats without claws and all 
systems go when she completed work on another place and time 
geffen refused to release it 
david said he didnt like the album he said he wasnt going to 
put it out and i could sue him if i wanted to she said i 
thought oh great then ill go this is the chance ive been 
waiting for i dont want to be here 
she signed with atlantic records and this time i know its for 
real the debut single soon reached the top 10 the album 
recorded in london was produced and written by the team of mike 
stock matt aitken and peter waterman who have also worked with 
rick astley and bananarama 
the guys who produced me are very commercial minded much more 
than i am she said as an artist and a writer you tend to want 
to do what you want to do theres a time you need to be commercial 
thats the whole object to sell records enough to be on a label 
you need somebody to kind of monitor your sense of creativity 
summer usually contributes her own material but admitted to 
getting sidetracked by more creative pursuits 
i got very involved in seeing polo played one of my best 
friends her husband is captain of prince charles polo team 
i had to go she said with a laugh i couldnt say no you 
dont get these chances all the time in life every week we went up 
there for about two days i had such a ball and i dont get to take 
a lot of vacations because of my kids 
summer who was born in 1948 in boston became the soloist in her 
church choir by age 10 
there was no question i would be a singer i just always knew 
i had credit in my neighborhood people would lend me money and tell 
me to pay it back when i got famous 
she began cashing in with love to love you baby a no 1 hit 
in 1975 that helped open the disco era 
for the next four years she was everywhere eight singles in the 
top 10 three reaching no 1 and three consecutive charttopping 
double albums live and more bad girls and on the radio 
greatest hits i and ii 
but summer was never comfortable with the disco queen label 
musically she began to change in 1979 with hot stuff which had 
a tough rock n roll beat 
i grew up on rock n roll said summer who later covered a 
bruce springsteen song protection 
i like the moody blues the beatles and the rolling stones as 
well as aretha franklin dionne warwick the supremes and 
temptations i didnt know many white kids who didnt know the 
supremes i dont know many black kids who dont know the moody 
blues 
and who would have guessed that the voice behind so many dance 
floor hits secretly longed for a house in the country 
when i was a kid i studied agriculture said summer who 
lives with her husband bruce sudano and three daughters on a 
california farm i wanted to do agriculture i always had a sense 
of wanting to live on a farm just being free to walk and have no 
people around i wanted to have a space where i didnt have to be 
anything for anybody 
summer is anxious to attract a young audience but concedes that 
todays kids would rather dance to madonna so what happened to the 
kids who danced to bad girls in 1979 
theyre having kids summer said and im going to hope 
their kids are buying records

veteran tv and country music entertainer 
bill anderson whose wife was almost killed in a traffic accident 
says he will never again perform songs about alcoholic beverages 
becky anderson 43 suffered brain damage and was given just a 
5050 chance to live after her car was struck head on by a truck 
driven by a drunken driver in 1984 
bill recounts the incident and several other personal setbacks 
in his new autobiography whisperin bill the book published by 
longstreet press takes its title from andersons nickname 
the 461page book marks another career milestone for anderson 
who has been a grand ole opry singer awardwinning songwriter soap 
opera actor network game show host record producer and businessman 
anderson said his wifes accident from which she has almost 
fully recovered has made him realize the danger of drinking and 
driving hes sworn off performing songs about drinking tunes that 
are a mainstay of country music 
this has really opened up my eyes to the fact it is very 
real he said i dont think before this happened that i was as 
sensitive to it as i am now before i thought it was just something 
you sang about and you kind of lived your life as you wanted to 
now i will not sing a drinking song 
the andersons filed a 4 million civil lawsuit after the 
accident a nashville jury awarded them 12 million but a judge 
reduced the award to 825000 at the time the 12 million was the 
largest amount ever awarded in nashville 
the whole thing that happened to her was so senseless the 
51yearold anderson said in an interview it didnt have to 
happen yet it did i cant blame it on anything other than the fact 
he the other driver celebrating his 18th birthday was drunk 
the accident happened after anderson had enjoyed one of the most 
successful and diverse careers among nashville entertainers 
anderson had been cohost of the abc game show the better 
sex had appeared periodically for three years on the soap opera 
one life to live and also acted in televisions alias smith 
and jones and the men 
he appeared frequently on other tv game shows such as hollywood 
squares and the match game anderson had recorded more than 40 
country music albums and won more than 50 awards for song writing 
he had appeared regularly on the grand ole opry since 1961 
but the accident wasnt the only tragedy faced by the andersons 
daughter terri now 28 was diagnosed as having cancer he lost 
millions as an investor in a restaurant chain and his own health 
declined because of a debilitating back problem that kept him on 
pain medication for months 
these things kept happening and you wake up every day and hope 
the last straw is on the camels back and nothing else will 
happen anderson said 
finally life is looking up again the accident and recovery 
strengthened his strained marriage the restaurant chain is on the 
rebound and doctors are optimistic that the cancer in terri was 
caught in time 
anderson whose best known songs are still and city 
lights said writing the book was therapeutic 
when everything came down as hard and fast as it did i had so 
much built up it just had to come out he said 
anderson said the adversity made me realize how blessed i had 
been all my life that i really had lived a charmed life up until 
then it made me thankful and more grateful for that you take 
things like good health for granted 
i think the biggest effect overall was in my priorities he 
said things that i thought were important were not and things i 
didnt think were important were more important than i had ever 
realized such as my family 
i had put career ahead of family at times but i dont think 
ill do that any more 
i learned about determination especially from watching what 
becky did during recovery there never has been a human being more 
determined 
in writing the book he learned quickly that its more work than 
composing a song you write a song and you write one page and 
youre finished with a book youre just getting started 
anderson said he got some good advice from fellow grand ole opry 
star jan howard who also recently wrote an autobiography 
she said when you mention frying the onions you have got to 
make them smell the onions

when island pictures released shes gotta have it about a 
sexually independent young woman spike lee was lionized as the 
leader of a new wave of independent filmmaking he had made the 1986 
lusty blackandwhite movie for an amazing 175000 
he spent millions more for do the right thing and with this 
frank realistic and brutal portrait of racism and its byproducts 
the brash young filmmaker has entered the mainstream 
race was not an issue in shes gotta have it in his last 
film school daze columbia pictures biggest grosser for 1988 
lee was strident and polemical in his treatment of racial issues 
but in do the right thing he allows the movie itself to unravel 
and define bigotry 
the theme for the movies title comes from a speech made by the 
late black activist malcolm x in december 1964 racism is a human 
problem and a crime that is absolutely so ghastly that a person who 
is fighting racism is well within his rights to fight against it by 
any means necessary until it is eliminated 
malcolm x and the late nobelist martin luther king jr both 
play an indirect role in the movie which takes place in a 
lowermiddleclass neighborhood in the bedfordstuyvesant section of 
brooklyn it is a longing to include photographs of the late civil 
rights leaders on a wall of fame in a pizza parlor run by an 
italian that sparks a tragic racial confrontation the italian owner 
has only the pictures of white italianamericans on his wall such 
as frank sinatra and sophia loren 
it is a sweltering summer in bedfordstuyvesant perspiration 
runs freely as do fire hydrants and tempers 
sal danny aiello and his two sons vito and pino open their 
pizzeria to start a new day da mayor ossie davis an ancient 
resident who spends his time washing down the yesteryears with a 
bottle of beer sweeps up mookie lee arrives in dodgers shirt 
they were once the brooklyn dodgers folks ready to do his 
delivery chores 
on the street radio raheem a young man of few words and an 
intense scowl lumbers about with a ghetto blaster the size of a 
minitruck forcing the world to listen to rap music the stuttering 
smiley lopes about trying to sell pictures of king and malcolm x 
buggin out the local activist grouses about how there are no 
blacks on the wall of fame and yet only blacks and hispanics 
frequent the pizza parlor 
lees neighborhood mosaic slowly takes shape with sharp images of 
human character tensions and conflicts abound mookie and the young 
woman who gave birth to his son radio raheem and the hispanic kids 
radio raheem and sal buggin out and sal sal and pino vito and 
pino mookie and pino 
it is the final confrontation between the hothead and racist pino 
and radio raheem that culminates in the movies violent end raheem 
is murdered by police people on the block respond by destroying 
sals pizzeria 
lee does not set up a frenzied random or mobinspired reaction 
indeed it is mookie a character who easily talks to everyone and 
who plays the role of peacekeeper who casts the first stone he is 
as malcolm x advised doing whatever is necessary to fight racism 
as sal the italian who has run a business in a black 
neighborhood for 25 years aiello is splendid davis is endearing as 
the downtrodden da mayor and his wife ruby dee has a wonderful 
character in da mayors love interest mother sister john torturro 
does a believable stupid punk as the racist pino and bill nunn is 
menacing as raheem 
the movie introduces rosie perez in the role of tina mookies 
girlfriend she also does some explosive dancing with the opening 
titles however as an actress her lines are muddled 
lee has created something of a repertory company with his films 
and one sees familiar faces in them all his sister joie lee who 
costarred in shes gotta have it returns as mookies gracious 
sister jade who is adored by sal giancarlo esposito who has 
costarred in lees two major releases plays buggin out 
esposito has found his niche with lee in shes gotta have 
it he was a nacissistic dandy in school daze he was a 
narcissistic fraternity brother as buggin out hes selfrighteous 
as for lee he has never really thought of himself as an actor 
yet he always puts in a star performance his direction is tight 
and the mood he creates leaves one as hot as the characters on the 
screen 
lee has a powerful movie whose truths may repel those who 
continue to deny that racism is indeed woven into the fabric of 
american life

they take too many drugs and sometimes plead 
for more they get confused shaky and sick and feel like theyre 
going crazy at least 200000 end up in hospitals each year untold 
thousands die 
dopeshooting junkies hardcore crack cocaine smokers 
no just folks taking their medicine 
most older people are taking too many drugs and are taking 
doses that are dangerously high said dr sidney wolfe director 
of the washingtonbased public citizen health research group 
founded by consumer advocate ralph nader 
the greatest epidemic of drug abuse in american society is 
among our older people who suffer 9 million adverse reactions to 
medicine a year many unrecognized as drugrelated says worst 
pills best pills wolfes 1988 book on overmedication of older 
people 
side effects include depression hallucinations confusion 
memory loss delirium impaired thinking shaking and twitching 
nausea vomiting appetite loss stomach pain and bleeding 
constipation diarrhea difficulty urinating and controlling 
urination dizziness and falls that result in hip fractures 
people 60 and older represent 17 percent of the us population 
but account for nearly 40 percent of drugrelated hospitalizations 
and more than half the deaths from drug reactions said richard 
kusserow inspector general of the us department of health and 
human services 
experts say the elderly are prone to harmful reactions or 
interactions between drugs because they take so many medicines 
largely because they have more maladies than younger people and age 
can slow the bodys ability to process and excrete drugs making it 
more likely they will interact or accumulate to toxic levels 
yet the elderly their relatives and doctors often blame 
drugrelated symptoms on old age said kathryn watterson author of 
the safe medicine book there isnt any reason people 
shouldnt expect to feel very good when they get older if they 
dont theres a reason either a disease or the medicine theyre 
on 
thousands of elderly americans die each year from adverse 
reactions to medications although the exact toll is unknown wolfe 
and kusserow said in a series of reports last year the arizona 
republic estimated drug reactions kill 73000 us senior citizens 
annually said reporter chuck cook now editor of the newhall 
calif signal that calculation was based on american hospital 
association and food and drug administration statistics and other 
research 
that could very well be in the right ball park said 
kusserow who calls overmedication of the elderly americas other 
drug problem 
in a report this year kusserow estimated that at least 200000 
elderly americans are hospitalized each year by adverse drug 
reactions we suspect the number is considerably larger because 
many hospitalizations are wrongly blamed on patients diseases 
rather than their medicines he said 
the republic estimated 19 million such hospitalizations yearly 
the pharmaceutical manufacturers association lacks data on 
drugrelated deaths and hospitalization if the republics estimates 
are correct such cases still represent much less than 1 percent of 
prescriptions written annually for americas elderly said spokesman 
jeff trewhitt the problem is not totally out of hand as is being 
implied he said 
wolfe however said us senior citizens fill 613 million 
prescriptions annually an average of 155 per person and many 
are taking as many as 10 different drugs at a time 
he contends at least twothirds of those prescriptions fall into 
one of three categories the dose is excessive a safer alternative 
should have been used or the prescription is unnecessary because 
the diagnosis is wrong or the disease should be treated by nondrug 
therapy such as diet changes 
sleeping pills tranquilizers and antianxiety drugs most 
commonly cause harmful side effects among the elderly said dr t 
franklin williams director of the national institute on aging 
drugs for cardiovascular and digestive ailments also are overused 
wolfe said 
elderly patients often have several doctors to avoid drug 
misuse older patients should get a brown paper bag put 
everything theyre taking in it and go review it with their primary 
doctor williams said 
in addition pharmacists should do a better job monitoring 
patients drug use to prevent harmful interactions kusserow said 
doctors receive woefully inadequate training in pharmacology and 
geriatrics and depend heavily on selfinterested drug company 
advertisements and salespeople for information he said 
many spend too little time with elderly patients and may not 
find out what drugs patients are on before giving new drugs said 
dr edward schneider gerontology dean at the university of southern 
california 
they also tend to use the prescription pad as the way to 
terminate an appointment with a patient watterson said 
patients share the blame though with more than half of elderly 
patients failing to follow dosage instructions kusserow said 
in addition older people can be very persistent demanding 
drugs and shopping around until they find a doctor who complies 
williams said 
i spend a lot of my time trying to talk elderly people out of 
taking drugs and they look at me like im crazy said dr michael 
freedman new york university medical centers geriatrics director 
all physicians probably prescribe more than they want to 
prescribe there are times when people sort of push you into giving 
them a prescription

thousands of elderly americans are hospitalized 
and die every year because they take too many medicines and suffer 
adverse reactions sam benton after two decades abusing 
prescription drugs kicked the habit on his own ap science writer 
lee siegel is his grandson 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
sam benton doesnt look like a junkie but 
for 22 years the unassuming grandfather was hooked on a narcotic 
painkiller and sleeping pills 
ive been on so many different kinds of pills youd have to get 
a book to tell you how many the more you take the worse off you 
are one pill leads to another pill and i was drinking liquor on 
top of that 
its a wonder hes alive today said rose benton 81 married 
for nearly 60 years to the retired clothing factory production 
manager you know what living in hell is watching somebody go 
through this 
for benton 86 recovery started early last year when he felt 
ill sleepless confused and like my mind wasnt acting properly 
he quit cigarettes most medicines and finally the two hefty 
shots of whiskey he enjoyed nightly last fall he spent two 
agonizing months withdrawing from his 22year habit of three to 
seven daily percodans a painkiller containing a synthetic narcotic 
he was a percodan junkie said bentons soninlaw portland 
lawyer sol siegel but he quit percodan at home without any help 
a doctor first prescribed percodan in 1966 when benton suffered 
severe stress headaches over the years he mixed percodan with 
feldene and indocin arthritis drugs orinase for diabetes 
antacids decongestants motrin a nonnarcotic painkiller 
coumadin to prevent blood clots that caused leg pains elavil an 
antidepressant and xanax ativan librium and serax to fight 
sleeplessness anxiety and nervousness 
the situation worsened several years ago when a car rearended 
bentons injuring his neck and prompting another doctor to 
prescribe more percodan 
doctors keep giving you the stuff you just tell them my head 
bothers me my neck bothers me i cant sleep theyll give you 
pills 
if any doctor objected benton would say doc if you take me 
off it youll hurt me more than if you leave me on it 
the minute it wears off you get a terrible urge everything 
begins to disturb you you crave it i couldnt go to sleep without 
it i couldnt do anything without it 
bentons daughter julie siegel said his latest doctor kept 
urging him to quit percodan but was compassionate enough not to cut 
off his supply 
gramp was desperately profoundly dependent on his various 
doctors to keep him in percodan he lived in fear of someone cutting 
him off it would be easy to condemn all the doctors involved but i 
can see their position too 
i dont want to blame my doctor i was the one who coaxed 
him said benton who finally decided to quit most medications and 
then percodan because of sleeplessness weakness druginduced hives 
and mental confusion 
as benton tapered off percodan i was weak sweaty nauseous 
had an inner craving my mind wouldnt relax i was hot and cold all 
the time he also suffered severe insomnia 
he now takes only coated aspirin for arthritis and occasionally 
onequarter of a sleeping pill my mind is now alert he said 
he sleeps and feels better and is starting to regain the 
motivation he believes the drugs robbed him of 
and he wants other senior citizens to know the dangers of 
overmedication it wrecks your body and your mind its going to 
ruin your life

here are 10 rules for safer drug use adapted 
from worst pills best pills the older adults guide to avoiding 
druginduced death or illness by dr sidney wolfe and others at 
the public citizen health research group 
1 have brown bag sessions with your primary doctor when 
you go to a doctor you havent seen before or with whom you have 
never had such a session dump into a bag all prescription and 
overthecounter drugs you are using have used in the last month or 
are likely to use and take them along 
discuss the reason each was prescribed the dose and frequency 
how long you should take it possible side effects possible 
interactions with foods or other drugs and whether you can stop 
taking any of them 
2 contact your doctor if you have any of the following symptoms 
after starting a drug depression hallucinations confusion 
delirium memory loss impaired thinking shaking or twitching 
dizziness upon standing falls loss of appetite nausea vomiting 
abdominal pain bleeding constipation diarrhea difficulty 
urinating and loss of bladder control 
3 assume that any new symptom you develop after starting a 
new drug might be caused by the drug report it to your doctor 
4 make sure you really need the drug for your condition and ask 
whether the side effects may be worse than the disease 
5 if drug therapy is indicated in most cases it is safer to 
start with a dose that is lower than the usual adult dose 
6 when adding a drug see if it is possible to stop another 
drug 
7 review with your doctor at least every three to six months 
the need to keep taking each drug 
8 before leaving the doctors office or pharmacy make sure you 
and a family member or friend understand the instructions for taking 
the medication 
9 discard all old drugs carefully throw them away when 
your therapy is over so you arent tempted to use or give away 
outdated drugs 
10 ask your primary doctor to coordinate your care and drugs 
if you see a specialist and he or she wants to start you on new 
medicines in addition to the ones you are on check with your 
primary doctor first

when next years head count is done census 
bureau officials expect to report there are more people aged 65 and 
over than there were americans at the time of the civil war 
the 1860 census found 314 million americans the 1990 count is 
expected to find 316 million people 65 and older 132 million of 
those being 75 and older the 1830 census counted 129 million 
people 
there is no historical precedent for the aging of our 
population we are in the midst of a new social phenomenon wrote 
beth j soldo and emily m agree in americas elderly a study 
for the private population reference bureau we cannot foresee all 
the repercussions implications or social changes stemming from the 
presence of so many older persons and the aging of society 
people born in 1900 could expect to live 47 years life 
expectancy passed 50 in 1908 topped 60 in the 1930s and hit 70 in 
the 60s americans born today can expect to live about 75 years 
thanks largely to better medical care 
the elderly comprise about 122 percent of the population well 
over half are women 70 percent say theyre healthy and 
threefourths own their homes they also spend a greater percentage 
of what are often fixed incomes on food housing and health care 
than younger people 
but take a closer look 
by definition the elderly are 65 and up but the mix is changing 
in 1960 61 percent of the population was 65 to 74 and 31 percent 
was 75 and older by 1987 72 percent were 65 to 74 and 5 percent 
were 75 or older 
a halfcentury ago men and women comprised equal numbers of the 
elderly but women began living longer in the 1930s as pregnancyand 
childbirthrelated deaths began declining women now live an average 
783 years compared with 715 years for men and comprise 592 
percent of those age 65 and over 
as of 1988 103 percent of all american males were 65 or older 
compared with 143 percent of all women 
the problems of old age in america are largely the problems of 
women six out of every 10 older americans are women said dr 
robert butler a former director of the national institute on aging 
in general older women have fewer financial assets and 
because they typically outlive their spouses are more dependent on 
adult children and formal health care services agree and soldo 
wrote 
and that poses a problem with the need for home care for many 
elderly rising just as social change threatens to undermine the 
traditional source of that care says researcher alice t day in a 
1985 population reference bureau report she estimated 66 million 
elderly people needed longterm care but only 14 million were in 
nursing homes the rest were helped by families but small families 
mean fewer young people to care for the elderly and most of them 
face other obligations including jobs 
while elderly women tend to be widows 80 percent of men aged 65 
to 74 are married as are 66 percent of those aged 75 and over 
as people age health is of increasing concern four out of 
every five noninstitutionalized older persons have at least one 
chronic condition and many have more than one said soldo and 
agree the most common of these diseases are arthritis 
hypertension heart disease and hearing impairments 
the national center for health statistics reported in 1984 that 
23 percent of the elderly had trouble completing at least one common 
task like shopping preparing meals and housework 
nevertheless a survey by the center found that 70 percent of 
elderly considered themselves to be in good or excellent health 
those with higher incomes were more likely to list themselves in 
excellent health 
since most elderly people are retired they have lower average 
incomes in 1986 median income for families headed by someone 65 
and older was 19932 about 62 percent of that for families headed 
by someone 25 to 64 the senate special committee on aging in 1985 
reported a median income of 20354 for families with a 65 to 
74yearold head 16412 for those headed by 75 to 84yearolds 
and 15111 for 85 and over 
with less cash the elderly tend to spend a bigger percentage of 
it on food housing and health care than do younger people even so 
business now views the elderly as a market segment of growing 
importance and has begun targeting products and advertising 
another place where the elderly have attracted attention is the 
voting booth more than one in five voters in the 1986 congressional 
elections was 65 and over while 46 percent of all eligible voters 
went to the polls 651 percent of those 65 to 74 voted the most of 
any population segment 
the senate committee found that most older people are adequately 
housed although some have problems finding affordable homes in 
1985 threefourths of elder households owned their home and 25 
percent rented males were more likely to own than were females and 
those over age 75 were more likely to rent 
the elderly tended to occupy older homes 36 percent living in 
house built before 1940 compared to 21 percent of younger people 
the 1983 annual housing survey found 10 percent of the homes 
occupied by the elderly with some serious flaw in such areas as 
plumbing electrical structure and heating

when bob rheinhart needed to expand his 
office recently he didnt have to look far for expertise the 
architect and skilled craftspeople he needed all were on his payroll 
and they all were retired 
so are the office workers at rheinharts 11yearold retiree 
skills inc a temporaryhelp agency handling people over age 50 
ads on buses cabs and elsewhere say it offers employers 
experience skills dependability 
i dont care how many age discrimination laws there are age is 
the main reason people over 50 arent hired when they seek work 
says rheinhart a 68yearold retired stockbroker we dont 
guarantee well get anyone a job but on the other hand we dont 
charge them anything either 
jack shine and roscoe lacy both 70 have been with retiree 
skills almost from its start 11 years ago 
id be lost without something productive to do and with the 
cost of living what it is the money dont hurt anything either 
says shine who ran his own sporting goods store for years now he 
paints houses limits his work week to 24 hours and will continue 
as long as i can climb a ladder 
lacy who spent 30 years in the navy averages 24 hours a week 
filling in for school custodians who are sick or on vacation ill 
do it as long as i can get around when youre active it keeps you 
young 
retiree skills offers workers in more than 200 job 
classifications including secretaries engineers accountants 
electricians word processors chemists plumbers carpenters 
mailroom personnel equipment operators masons computer 
programmers auditors and laborers 
theres even a professional clown rheinhart says 
the national council on aging says it knows of no similar group 
most temporaryhelp agencies specialize in categories like office 
workers most employment organizations for retirees are limited to 
one type of professional 
workers remain on the payroll of retiree skills saving the 
temporary employer social security sick pay retirement vacation 
and insurance costs which can total a third or more of the average 
payroll employers are billed for actual time at a rate above what 
workers are paid which rheinhart says is near the areas prevailing 
wage for their skill the minimum is 4 an hour 
more than 300 companies have used retiree skills and rheinhart 
says he has found work for more than 2500 people about 800 now are 
registered 
most came to us originally as a last resort can you believe 
the morale boost for someone whos almost at the point of feeling 
useless and then finding hes got talent that people are looking for 
and are willing to pay for and the flip side is that the people who 
use them are getting genuine bargains aside from their skills 
their oldfashioned work ethic is so different from whats 
fashionable today among younger people rheinhart says 
i have a very positive reaction to retiree skills says 
barbara walker office manager for desert analytics a small testing 
laboratory 
harold koenig a retired chemical engineer did so well as a 
temporary lab technician that he was hired as a regular working 
somewhat less than 40 hours a week because he wants mondays off 
walker says 
another worker a 58yearold banker forced out in a corporate 
realignment was sent to a savings and loan and stayed eight years 
he had applied for work at 60 places rheinhart says including the 
one that finally kept him on 
retiree skills keeps people on social security advised about how 
much they may earn without penalties those 65 to 70 can make 8800 
this year and still receive all benefits under 65 its 6480 
generally 1 in benefits is lost for each 2 earned over the limit 
at 70 full benefits are available regardless of earnings 
rheinhart who had started a life insurance company in dayton 
ohio and a brokerage in columbus retired to tucson to play golf 
but you can play just so much golf without getting bored most of 
the people i met were older and i was hearing two things from them 
they either didnt have enough to do or if they did have things to 
do they didnt have enough money to do them 
about that time the national council on aging put on a tv 
commercial that showed an empty rocking chair that was in motion 
with the suggestion it was time for the elderly to get off their 
rocker 
those two things gave me the idea to start retiree skills 
he hopes eventually to franchise the retiree skill idea and has 
trademarked its slogan from inactivity to productivity

marjory stoneman douglas stands watch over the 
everglades with the temperament of the ancient sawgrass that 
dominates the wetland 
she can be smooth and genteel hands folded in her lap and voice 
hinting at the refinement of her new england upbringing more than 
three generations ago 
yet like the sawgrass she cuts for the bone when rubbed the 
wrong way 
its not a question of if we can save the everglades we 
must said douglas 99 there is no choice to consider without 
the everglades much of florida is lost too 
water is the gift of the everglades a soggy plain that ends a 
300mile water system running down the center of the florida 
peninsula this slowmoving river of grass part of the title 
of douglas 1947 book starts a process that brings rain to the 
populated coast during the sixmonth wet season 
whether youre a developer or an environmentalist the message 
is still the same douglas said if the everglades go then 
south florida becomes a desert 
the greatest threat isnt pollution but the draining of land to 
accommodate the boom in one of the fastest growing states id say 
about 80 percent of the everglades are unspoiled but what im most 
worried about is mans ignorance of the importance of the 
everglades the people coming to florida know nothing about the 
everglades that is our greatest peril 
age has clouded douglas sight but her vision is reaching new 
horizons 
recent attention to the everglades has brought renewed attention 
to her crusade in january she and five other women were named ms 
magazines women of the year she was abc news person of the week 
jan 13 and was on the nbc today show in february in may she 
became an honorary vice president of the national sierra club the 
highest award the organization gives 
but she was conspicuously absent from a threeday conference in 
january on the everglades which featured more than 200 experts and 
officials she prefers to surrender the highprofile events to the 
friends of the everglades a group she founded in the 1960s shed 
rather greet visitors in the stucco cottage that she built in 1926 
in coconut grove 
from her easy chair surrounded by cassette tapes of books she 
receives word on the political battles being waged over the 
everglades why do people worry about me and my age so much 
said douglas who disdains ambiguity i get by lets concentrate 
on the real problems 
she has been to the everglades what winston churchill was to 
britain in world war ii said mike finley the parks 
superintendent she has been the leader the conscience the 
rallying point 
throughout her life douglas has kept a distant relationship with 
the everglades even when her sight was good she rarely traveled 
into the grass and cypress interior besides she says there are 
too many bugs 
every time it rains we know the everglades are there said 
douglas who dons a floppy widebrimmed hat whenever outdoors 
its not necessary to be out there to feel its presence 
i suppose you could say the everglades and i have the kind of 
friendship that doesnt depend on constant physical contact she 
wrote in river of grass the product of five years research 
in 1915 douglas left a domineering husband in new jersey and 
boarded a southbound train her destination was literally the end of 
the line miami was then a ramshackle railway terminus of 5000 
residents where ice was scarce and dreams of riches in real estate 
abounded 
it was also home to her father a lawyer who founded what would 
become the miami herald newspaper with a printing press he collected 
on a bad debt 
douglas landed a job as a columnist and reporter but soon left 
to sell freelance magazine articles in 1943 she began a novel to 
help overcome an emotional breakdown following her fathers death 
when a publisher asked for a book on the tiny miami river she felt 
it too insignificant she persuaded the publisher to consider a 
treatise on the everglades water system 
nearly 50 years later the book is still in print 
among her other eight books are florida the long frontier in 
1967 and alligator crossing a childrens book she can no 
longer use a typewriter but is determined to dictate a biography of 
english environmentalist wh hudson best known for his book 
green mansions 
death in douglas view is the end she believes in no afterlife 
for herself or for south florida if the everglades perish when 
the everglades are gone then we are finished theres not much to 
consider beyond that

t franklin williams a geriatrics physician is 
director of the national institute on aging one of the 13 
institutes that comprise the national institutes of health of the 
department of health and human services

a person born during the year 1900 could 
expect to live to be 50 years old today a persons life expectancy 
at birth is 75 years a full generation longer why are people 
living longer what do these extra years mean to the individual to 
the family to society 
how long a person lives depends on several factors genetics 
medical advances lifestyle and environmental assaults 
science and medicine have given us antibiotics vaccines and 
better medical care so that illnesses once fatal no longer are 
people are more aware than ever of changes in lifestyle that affect 
health eating a wellbalanced diet that limits fats and fiber 
exercising sensibly wearing seat belts quitting smoking and 
drinking little if any alcohol have all contributed to longer 
healthier lives governmental regulations have eliminated many 
concerns about the food we eat the water we drink and the air we 
breathe 
some 20 or 30 years ago people believed that getting old meant 
an inevitable decline of health and intellectual function in fact 
many medical textbooks still use the word senile to describe 
people who suffer confusion and memory loss and imply that this 
condition is a natural consequence of age 
today thanks to studies on normal human aging we know that 
people can live to be 100 and more with no evidence of heart disease 
or memory impairment scientists also have concluded that 
personality does not change with age in fact there are few if 
any changes that occur to all people as they grow old 
despite these results there are many people for whom aging is no 
joy i recently met a woman in her mid70s who confided no one 
ever told me that growing old hurts so much many older people 
become dependent on family members and society because of 
debilitating conditions that severely restrict their independence 
arthritis osteoporosis and alzheimers disease to name a few are 
problems for which science and society have not yet found adequate 
solutions a person should be able to remain functional and vigorous 
throughout life 
as director of the national institute on aging at the national 
institutes of health i am all too frequently asked is this what 
i have to look forward to as i grow old studies that help us to 
understand and eliminate the afflictions that rob a person of 
independence are a high priority among researchers around the world 
make no mistake we have made progress for example we have the 
expertise to treat certain forms of urinary incontinence we have 
identified the risk factors that make falls and subsequent fractures 
likely and we understand the benefits of early rehabilitation after 
stroke 
because of these and other successes many children today know 
their grandparents and even their great grandparents in many 
cases grandparents are an integral part of the family and are 
called upon to lend support to the family unit this is all very 
positive however new problems arise as many grown children are 
called upon to care for a frail parent or relative for many the 
caregiving role is fraught with doubts guilt tedium and fears and 
indeed is an area which requires innovative approaches to best serve 
all concerned 
to society the implications of the growing number of older 
people is still confusing many healthy older people do not choose 
retirement they wish to remain employed healthcare systems do not 
yet know how to respond to the growing number of people who require 
longterm care health professionals and policymakers need to sort 
out the ramifications of having so many older people in need of 
assistance 
from the day you are born you begin to age no matter how old you 
are aging issues apply i hope this information will serve to 
eliminate some of the common fears many of us have about growing old

my garden looks tidier and yields richer harvests today than the 
vegetable patch i was cultivating eight years ago when at age 65 i 
drew my first pension check leisure has worked wonders 
new retirees planning to raise vegetables will enter an exciting 
era the kitchen garden reflecting our widely traveled population 
has acquired a global look with european and oriental favorites now 
maturing next to the old corn patch midget vegetables and intensive 
growing techniques have come along for people with small gardens 
also power tillers as light as 17 pounds a boon for seniors 
to meet demand new seed houses have sprung up dealing primarily 
in exotic fare old established catalogs have added international 
sections if you liked a crisp lettuce you savored in france a red 
radicchio chicory in italy or a bokchoi cabbage in asia you can 
find the seeds here meanwhile domestic breeders multiplied their 
own offerings all told up to 130 new cultivars from beans to 
zucchini appeared in this years catalogs 
why grow your own when the worlds choicest produce adorns 
supermarket shelves well anyone who has nurtured a bean or tomato 
from babyhood knows no storebought veggie matches the taste of the 
home gardens fresh young crops legions of us share that feeling a 
gallup survey for the national gardening association shows 31 
million us households grew vegetables in 1988 some garden 
organically avoiding pesticides 
for my 70th birthday my wife children and grandchildren bought 
me a new fence to replace the unsightly sagging wire and rotting 
locust poles with a posthole digger and grunts of strength my son 
put in pressuretreated poles to resist the weather above the taut 
new chicken wire we strung a batteryoperated hot wire to keep 
out woodchuck and raccoon 
along with the facelift i set out to deepen the scattered 
knowhow i had accumulated in 30 years of gardening enrolling in a 
college horticulture course i met numerous other seniors with the 
same intention among them a 75yearold whose children had given 
him a greenhouse for his birthday we got valuable tips and sobering 
insights into the magnitude of the subject from professors 
discussing soil water sun and plants in terms of complex chemical 
equations 
seniors wanting a less formal approach will find wide coverage of 
gardening in books magazines and newspapers the best advice often 
coming from the local columnist who knows the peculiarities of the 
area television radio and videocassettes cover the field computer 
owners can buy software that will design gardens plan crops 
according to geographical location give tips on fertilizers 
estimate costs and keep records 
on my own i dug into the oftenhardtofind history and legends 
of the vegetables i was raising putting together a modest little 
bookshelf of intriguing lore and smoothly helped along by my word 
processor i streamlined and greatly expanded my daytoday notes on 
the progress of the season 
as time went on gardening became more and more a yearround 
activity for me indoors under lights im always growing 
something in the winter i raise lettuce arugula parsley basil 
chives and some small tomatoes in a custommade fluorescent stand in 
the dining room the same stand serves to start the seeds for most 
of my outdoor summer crops giving me a jump on the season 
we live in the country 50 miles north of manhattan with plenty 
of room in my 65by25foot garden for spacegobblers like corn and 
asparagus but in sharply dwindled space i could still produce 
quantity and variety for just me and my wife nationwide gardens 
keep getting smaller a gallup survey shows the typical plot dropped 
in 1988 to only 200 square feet but along with the drop have come 
miniature vegetables and techniques for utilizing space to the 
utmost tomato plants no taller than a foot are producing small 
fruit in fourinch pots 
ive found that three or four broccoli plants two zucchini 
plants a few tomato plants and a couple of eggplants fill our 
twoperson needs in these crops i grow varieties with staggered 
harvests and also succession crops of beans and lettuce keeping the 
garden busy deep into the frosts of autumn coldloving brussels 
sprouts still green in the snow provide us with gardenfresh 
vegetables for christmas dinner 
from the parttime gardening of my working years ive become a 
fulltime gardener with something of a farmers priorities when 
friends grouse about a rainy forecast im thinking the rain is good

time inc as part of its battle against 
paramount communications incs hostile 107 billion bid for the 
media company released a legal brief by the attorneys general of 13 
states that opposes the transfer of times cable tv franchises to 
paramount 
time also said in a statement sunday the us conference of 
mayors had written to dennis c patrick chairman of the federal 
communications commission expressing concern over paramounts 
desire to transfer the franchise agreements 
in their filing with the fcc on friday the attorneys general 
said that if the franchises are transferred without prior approval 
of the local and state authorities that granted them federal 
state and local laws will be violated and the rights of state and 
local franchise authorities to review effectively and preapprove the 
transfer of cable franchises will be lost 
paramount has proposed that it purchase shares in time through a 
trust that would hold the stock until permission to transfer the 
cable franchises was obtained 
the letter from the mayors group dated wednesday said that the 
paramount plan is an attempt to circumvent the requirement that 
transfer of cable francises receive prior approval of state and 
local franchising authorities and to avoid its legal obligations at 
the state and municipal levels 
the issue of transferring the cable licenses held by times 
american television and communications corp is one of several time 
has raised as it attempts to fight paramounts bid and continue with 
its own plans to buy warner communications inc through a 14

several times before despite the efforts of time to stir up 
opposition with misinformation we expect to get state and local 
cable franchise approvals in an orderly and expeditious way

civil rights gains will be eroded further if a 
federal judge approves general motors corps proposed settlement of 
a discrimination suit says a spokesman for a group of disgruntled 
black workers 
the concerned black salaried employees of general motors has 
called on the black community including coworkers to boycott gm 
products until a settlement it believes is more equitable is 
reached spokesman napoleon quick jr said sunday 
the group also hopes to fill a courtroom with angry workers 
today when us district judge john feikens in detroit is scheduled 
to begin two days of hearings on gms settlement proposal 
the employee group spent the weekend rallying support for the 
boycott it launched wednesday quick said during a telephone 
interview from his detroit home he said the group has draw up to 
600 people at its meetings 
we feel that if the settlement is forced down our throats by 
judge feikens then that will begin a new era of discrimination in 
this country said quick 52 a former gm salaried worker and 
plaintiff in the suit 
we feel our days in court have been just about snuffed out 
because of the recent supreme court decisions involving racial 
issues including reverse discrimination he said 
passive resistance is the approach that we must now seriously 
consider to make fair hiring practices a real part of good business 
practice in general quick said 
the suit filed in 1983 by four black salaried gm employees was 
certified for class action in 1986 on behalf of 10000 such workers 
in michigan ohio and indiana 
gm has offered to pay cash settlements to some workers and raise 
the salaries of others but the automaker does not admit to 
discriminating against black workers in pay raises and promotions 
if accepted the settlement would amount to 20 million to 40 
million over the next five years for the plaintiffs their attorneys 
said 
gm also proposes to monitor the pay and promotion of black 
workers for five years and to assess that information using computer 
models for comparable white employees 
we continue to believe that the proposed agreement is a winwin 
settlement and we will wait for the courts review this week gm 
spokeswoman patricia molloy said 
but the settlement proposal falls short in several areas 
including payment for damages or lost wages the concerned black 
salaried employees said 
the gm plan would make payments only to those workers whose wages 
were most out of line rather than compensate all black workers 
whose salary fell below the norm the group claims 
it also said the companys proposal would be less binding and 
enforceable than current policies under the us department of labor 
not all of the suits plaintiffs oppose the gm proposal one of 
the original four workers who filed the suit the rev james e 
kennedy of flint said he favors the proposed settlement

william winpisinger the unapologetic 
outspoken liberal leader of the machinists union walked away 
quietly last week in the middle of his biggest fight 
from retirement however the labor veteran once referred to as 
the labor movements last angry man will surely be heard from 
again 
his unions strike against eastern airlines was nearing the 
fourmonth point as winpisinger 62 took leave friday of the union 
he had joined 38 years ago as a high school dropout and led as 
president for the past 12 he was succeeded by george kourpias who 
had been a union vice president 
i had hoped very much to have that as a retirement present 
winpisinger said last week when asked whether he believed the 
machinists would win their war with eastern and parent texas air 
corp but the strike continues and ill be more than a casually 
interested observer for the most of the way 
to winpisinger the strike against eastern and the bigger battle 
with texas air chairman frank lorenzo is the manifestation of the 
antiunion animus of the reagan years 
there wasnt a single employer in the country that didnt get 
that message loudly and clearly and tried to emulate it he said 
and weve had a wave of unionbusting and everything else 
reminiscent of decades long ago 
but winpisinger believes the tide is turning that better days 
for the labor movement lie ahead if its leaders act responsibly 
when that power comes back and i view it as inevitable it has 
to be used more responsibly than ever before so as to diffuse the 
notion that we are a special interest that we bargain only for 
ourselves that organized workers are somehow greedy by 
definition he said 
he believes a new breed of labor leaders is emerging most of 
them are younger tested battlehardened and had to live through 
all this evolution and discomfort afflicted by the reagan years 
he said 
weve profited from that we learned what we had to do with our 
backs against the wall 
his liberal view has prompted some to label him a socialist and 
winpisingers criticisms of the reagan defense buildup often seemed 
odd coming from the president of a union representing thousands of 
workers in defenserelated industries 
he blames the defense buildup for the decline of basic 
manufacturing and research and development in the united states and 
he labels reagan a hypocrite for making rallying cries for us 
industry to become more competitive 
where the hell do you get all the brains to do that when hes 
already siphoned all of them into the defense complex said 
winpisinger 
his harsh words are not for republicans alone 
the democratic party he said needs to stop trying to imitate 
republicans and return instead to its traditional base 
we have a lot of people who are running around masquerading as 
democrats who are pale imitations of the enemy said winpisinger 
who nominated jesse jackson for president at the 1988 democratic 
national convention 
who will emerge as the partys future leader winpisingers not 
sure 
if the american people showed any propensity at all to elect 
high school dropouts president of the united states id go out and 
given the money id try it myself he said with a grin rolling 
a fat cigar between his fingers 
retirement will take him away from the platform the nearly 
millionmember machinists union gave him but winpinsinger promises 
speak out when i perceive the need and perceive that someone will 
listen i dont intend to be invisible 
he will freely assess others but not himself refusing to discuss 
his contribution to the labor movement besides winpisinger says he 
has more important things to worry about 
i have to catch up on 38 years of accumulated tasks he said 
and find out whether or not me and my wife can live under the same 
roof on a daily basis or what kind of adjustments i have to make to 
make that possible

sears roebuck and co said today it will keep its 
6000employee merchandise group in illinois but move it to a 
chicago suburb we believe this chicagoland location will serve 
the best interests of our company and its shareholders for decades 
to come chairman edward brennan said in a statement released 
before a morning news conference 
we anticipate that the move to the new facility will begin in 
2 to 3 years he said 
the site is in hoffman estates 20 miles northwest of chicago 
last fall the nations largest retailer announced a 
restructuring plan that included selling the 110story sears tower 
the worlds tallest building and shifting the merchandise group 
and its 6000 employees to less costly quarters 
the announcement set off a bidding war between illinois and 
sunbelt states especially north carolina and texas 
the chicago tribune said illinois offered an incentive package 
worth an estimated 61 million to lure the merchandise group to a 
200acre site in hoffman estates the newspaper said local tax 
breaks to sears will be worth an estimated 178 million 
the total proposal that was worked out is extremely competitive 
with alternative sites brennan said 
the hoffman estates site is part of an undeveloped 1300 acres 
north of the northwest tollway at illinois 59 
sears said it had signed a contract to purchase 700 acres along 
the tollway including an outdoor music theater poplar creek sears 
said the theater will continue operating 
the hoffman estates parcel was selected from about 50 sites in 
the chicago area and other states brennan said 
sears estimates that building a campusstyle facility in hoffman 
estates will cost about 220 million the development will 
eventually generate an estimated 11 million a year in property 
taxes 
brennan said future commercial development of the site also is 
planned 
the tribune and the chicago suntimes said the deal was cemented 
sunday after talks between illinois gov james r thompson and 
brennan 
when the merchandise group move is completed about 600 employees 
of sears corporate staff will remain in the downtown sears tower 
the company said

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
killing a lawsuit growing out of the development of an aeromedical 
center in kaduna nigeria 
the court said it will review a decision requiring ws 
kirkpatrick amp co a new jersey corporation to defend itself 
against allegations that it won the contract by illegally bribing 
nigerian government officials 
those allegations are raised in a suit filed by environmental 
tectonics corp of pennsylvania 
a justice department investigation of the 1981 contract between 
kirkpatrick and the nigerian government led to kirkpatricks 
pleading guilty to one count of violating the foreign corrupt 
practices act 
kirkpatrick was fined 75000 
environmental tectonics which had submitted a lower bid for the 
nigerian contract then sued kirkpatrick its lawsuit alleged that 
environmental tectonics would have been awarded the contract but for 
kirkpatricks payment of bribes 
a federal judge dismissed the suit relying on the socalled 
act of state doctrine it precludes us courts from inquiring 
into the validity of a foreign governments acts committed within 
its own territory 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals however reinstated the 
suit last year the traditional justification for invoking the 
doctrine avoiding a judicial determination of the legal validity 
of a states act within its own borders is not present in this 
case the appeals court said 
kirkpatrick then sought the supreme courts help 
the case is kirkpatrick amp co vs environmental tectonics corp

britain today rejected plans to create a 
single european currency and a central bank but pledged to accept 
some elements of a plan to form a united european market by late 
1992 
west germany however urged the leaders of the 12nation 
european economic community to endorse the single currency and 
central bank 
french president francois mitterrand also enthusiastic about a 
sole currency and central bank said he may renege on an agreement 
to lift controls on the movement of the french franc if britain 
holds up the economic union plan 
under the plan being considered at an eec summit in madrid 
member states would gradually hand over economic policymaking power 
to the eec surrendering aspects of national sovereignty is a key 
issue as the community heads toward dropping all trade barriers and 
creating the single market in 1992 
decisions on these matters are simply not on the current 
agenda british officials quoted prime minister margaret thatcher 
as telling the closeddoor summit meeting we must stick to the 
practical and go for what needs to be done now 
the leaders adjourned for lunch on the first day of the twoday 
summit with aides seeking to draw up a compromise position 
west german chancellor helmut kohl pressed the leaders to accept 
the plan in its entirety said his spokesman hans klein 
as part of endorsing the first stage of the plan which would 
begin in july 1990 mrs thatcher pledged to link the pound to the 
other major eec currencies by joining the exchange rate mechanism of 
the european monetary system 
but a british spokesman who requested anonymity said mrs 
thatcher said britain would join the european monetary system if 
britains 83 percent inflation rate was reduced significantly 
other eec countries abolish exchange controls by july 1990 and the 
community allows an open market in banking and financial services 
mrs thatcher argued that earlier membership of the currency 
alignment by britain could have shaken the entire system britain is 
the only major oil producer in the eec and the pound is boosted by 
oil price increases which tend to depress the other currencies 
since spain joined last week only britain greece and portugal 
are outside the system 
pedro solbes spokesman for spanish prime minister felipe 
gonzalez said that despite the disagreement over monetary union 
the atmosphere was positive in general 
but we shouldnt be led into fooling ourselves were going 
to have to work very hard theres only a slim possibility of an 
agreement but it is worth making the effort he added 
mrs thatcher remained isolated on the second major issue at the 
meeting proposals for communitywide regulations guaranteeing 
workers rights including representation on company boards 
earlier lord plumb president of the european parliament the 
eecs legislature cautioned summit leaders in an opening address 
that all these issues strike at the heart of national 
decisionmaking 
it is not surprising that in the past the expressions of grand 
aspiration have not always produced quick results said plumb a 
british conservative 
mrs thatcher criticized within her conservative party for her 
oftencombative stance toward the eec has adopted a more 
conciliatory tone in madrid stressing britains commitment to 
europe 
late sunday as the eec leaders assembled for their semiannual 
meeting west germany indicated that it will settle for a 
declaration of political will as opposed to a firm commitment on 
the two final stages of monetary union 
i see possibilities that we will come to a common position 
said lutz stavenhagen a senior aide to kohl but we dont want to 
go into the blue we need the political will to come to an end 
mrs thatchers aides discounted reports that the prime minister 
feels she is in a weaker position because of her partys defeat by 
britains labor party in elections this month for the european 
parliament 
the latest british opinion poll by harris was published sunday 
and showed the conservatives trailing labor by 14 points 
the other common market members are belgium denmark france 
ireland italy luxembourg and the netherlands

firsttime home buyers are on a financial 
treadmill unable to afford a 20 percent down payment they rent 
instead paying out so much each month that little remains for 
savings 
so common is the situation that nearly everyone knows someone 
caught in that bind statistics seem to document it homeownership 
for households in the 2529 age group fell to 362 percent in 1988 
from 433 percent in 1980 
the primary reason for this trend which directly contradicts the 
dearly held notion that opportunity keeps growing in america is the 
inability of renter households to raise cash for a down payment and 
closing costs 
that conclusion was reached this month in a study by the joint 
center for housing studies of harvard university which suggested 
the distribution of economic opportunity in american society was 
thereby becoming polarized 
it wasnt the first time that conclusion was reached in fact 
us senate hearings were held this month on a national affordable 
housing act which seeks to break the stalemate in a manner fair to 
both renters and homeowners 
no one proposal is likely to get things moving again in the lower 
tier of housing markets although it is widely agreed that federal 
tax incentives and mortgage subsidies and outright government grants 
might spur some activity 
but in an age in which privatization attracts considerable 
attention little of that attention is directed to a reasonable and 
intelligent solution that is so private it remains within the family 
simply stated the solution is the opportunity for those with 
housing equity such as parents to pass on that equity to offspring 
the justice of it is unassailable the reason some current owners 
have such a large supply of equity is inflation it is one of the 
most important reasons if not the primary reason why their 
children cannot afford to buy 
the tax system seems to approve a portion of equity can be 
transferred by the owner without tax complications in fact there 
could be tax advantages should the owner borrow on a primary 
residence to finance an offsprings home 
the money could be in the form of a gift or gifts or it could be 
as a loan in the latter case the rationale seems impeccable it 
would help a loved one it would be a wellsecured loan it would 
mean a high yield to the lender 
in fact where in the vast universe of investments would a lender 
call him or her an investor or saver if you prefer find a 
sounder use for longterm money mortgage money remember is lent 
at 10 percent or more 
the timing may be propitious too many parents are beginning to 
think of the day when they can retire and that happy dream is 
almost instantly followed by the worrisome topic of retirement 
income here it is a monthly check 
the harvard report from its joint center for housing studies 
notes that only 115 percent or 128 million of the estimated 111 
million renter households in the 2534 age group have sufficient 
assets and income to buy a starter home 
of that 111 million the bigger of the drawbacks is assets not 
income 
many thousands of renters therefore would seem to qualify for a 
lowcost starter home if they had the down payment lacking it they 
rent and hope that their ability to save is stronger than the 
advance in housing prices 
if it isnt they fall behind and all because of a down payment 
that already resides within the family

futures prices of corn and soybeans closed sharply 
lower monday on the chicago board of trade amid rain forecasts 
wheat futures finished mostly higher on signs of large soviet 
purchases of us wheat 
most corn contracts plunged more than 9 cents a bushel following 
a wetterthanexpected weekend in iowa nebraska and southwestern 
minnesota 
more moisture was expected in the midwest as the cold front moved 
east 
twothirds of the corn belt is expected to get rain today and 
tomorrow said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter 
reynolds inc in chicago 
talk circulated that the soviet union had bought at least 500000 
metric tons of us wheat on the open market 
analysts said the buying indicated that the soviets needed wheat 
immediately since they usually buy us grain through a subsidy 
program which takes longer 
at the close of trading wheat was 3 cents lower to 4 cents

sears roebuck and co will move its 6000worker 
merchandising hub from downtown chicago to suburban hoffman estates 
the giant retailer announced monday in capping a bidding war between 
illinois and the sunbelt for the facility 
illinois won the contest with the aid of a 61 million package of 
incentives which was backed by local tax incentives reportedly 
totaling up to 178 million 
we believe this chicagoland location will serve the best 
interests of our company and its shareholders for decades to come 
chairman edward brennan said at a morning news conference in the 
downtown sears tower 
last fall the nations largest retailer announced a 
restructuring plan that includes selling the 110story sears tower 
the worlds tallest building and shifting the merchandise group 
hub to less costly quarters 
the announcement set off a fierce competition between illinois 
and sunbelt states especially north carolina and texas 
illinois offered a 61 million package of incentives to keep the 
merchandise group headquarters said gov james r thompson who 
joined brennan at the news conference 
jay r hedges director of the state department of commerce and 
community affairs said sears would continue paying taxes but about 
80 percent of the tax revenue would be used for development costs of 
the hoffman estates project 
illinois will recoup its investment during the merchandise 
groups fifth year in its new headquarters hedges and thompson said 
hoffman estates offered a 20year plan of tax incentives the 
chicago tribute in mondays editions quoted an unnamed source as 
valuing the villages incentives at 178 million although neither 
state nor village officials would confirm the figure 
peter t burchard village manager in the middleclass suburb of 
45000 said local taxing districts would get 67 million in revenue 
over the life of the local plan 
sears estimates that building a campusstyle facility on the 200 
acres it plans to use in hoffman estates will cost about 220 
million the rest of the tract also will be commercially developed 
and sears hopes to draw other corporate offices to the site brennan 
said 
brennan said sears which began in chicago in 1887 was 
expected to begin moving the merchandising operation to the hoffman 
estates site about 30 miles northwest of chicago in 2 to three 
years 
when the merchandise group move is completed about 600 employees 
of sears corporate staff will remain in the downtown sears tower 
brennan said 
we understand the strong ties which sears has to chicago and 
know that the people of that great city are pleased to have the 
decision in their favor said carroll gray president of the 
charlotte chamber of commerce 
we understood all along that chicago was probably sears first 
choice gray said 
brennan also said chicago had been the companys first choice 
but he believed it was his responsibility to sears shareholders to 
look at other prospective sites 
thompson said the incentive package was the biggest the state has 
ever put together to keep jobs in illinois illinois offered 88 
million to entice diamondstar motors to normal in 1985

sears chairman edward brennan has a reputation as 
a numbers man and his decision to keep the sears merchandise group 
in the chicago area is backed by some persuasive figures 
local tax breaks that reportedly could total 178 million for 
starters 
but it is possible that sentimental factors also came into play 
as brennan and his team weighed the pros and cons of 50 potential 
sites before settling on hoffman estates a suburb about 30 miles 
northwest of chicago 
less than a month ago rumors had the 6000 employees of the 
retailing units headquarters packed up and ready to roll to 
charlotte nc 
dallas was also in the running 
but the decision announced monday suggests that sears 
centuryold chicago roots may run deeper than the sunbelt sun could 
reach 
sears roebuck and co grew up here 
and brennan grew up with it 
his grandfather father mother and two uncles all worked for the 
company at a rambling west side complex that contained distribution 
facilities and until the completion of sears tower in 1974 the 
companys headquarters 
brennan joined sears as a clerk in madison wis in 1956 just 
after graduating from college and moved to the chicago headquarters 
as a buyer in 1959 
his climb up the corporate ladder entailed a series of 
outofstate assignments from 1967 until 1980 when he was brought 
back to illinois as head of the merchandise group 
in addition to the merchandise group sears owns the dean witter 
reynolds financial services group allstate insurance and the 
coldwell banker real estate concern 
brennan has no great love for sears tower the worlds tallest 
building which the company is selling as part of its costcutting 
plan nevertheless his office will remain on the 68th floor of the 
110story skyscraper after the retail group moves out 
the relocation of the retailing headquarters will recreate for 
those workers the sort of working environment that brennan found so 
agreeable as a young sears executive 
when you are housed in a vertical structure you have less 
people interaction than when you are in a lowrise campustype 
environment he said in an interview late last year you have a 
more cohesive organization when theres more people interaction 
the sale of the tower may occur by the end of this year said 
analyst monroe greenstein of bear stearns amp co who said sears 
insiders had told him they were in no rush to sell the building 
greenstein said the decision to move the retailing group to the 
suburbs satisfied three major criteria 
first he said sears will avoid major disruptions of its 
retailing operations a particularly sensitive point because the 
company recently launched an ambitious effort to lure more consumers 
to its stores by offering lower prices and more brand names 
second in addition to the 200acre building site the deal 
includes 700 acres along an expressway including an outdoor music 
theater called poplar creek sears said the theater will continue 
operating and greenstein said sears commercialization of the 
remaining land will pay for the construction of the merchandise 
groups new headquarters 
third sears got all those tax breaks 
illinois offered a 61 million package of incentives also the 
chicago tribune quoted unidentified sources monday saying the 
villages incentives were worth 178 million although neither state 
nor village officials would confirm the amount 
greenstein and others said sears ruled out north carolina because 
it would not have been a convenient destination for foreign 
visitors especially sears suppliers from japan and south korea

stock prices took a spill today as traders cashed 
in some of the gains that carried the market to new postcrash highs 
on friday 
the markets climb last week to new peaks since the debacle in 
the fall of 1987 was spurred by accumulating evidence of a slowing 
economy 
as interest rates fell in the credit markets rumors circulated 
that the federal reserve might soon lower its discount rate the 
charge it sets on loans to private financial institutions 
the fed took no such step immediately however and traders began 
the new week in a more cautious mood 
brokers also noted that the market was running out of support 
from window dressing by money managers at investing institutions 
readying their portfolios for midyear reports to clients

the number of working oil and natural gas rigs 
continued an upward climb this week growing by 15 rigs to total 
810 according to baker hughes inc 
the increase marked the fifth straight weekly gain for the 
nationwide count which increased by four rigs last week a year 
ago the count totaled 894 baker hughes reported monday 
the companys rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing 
oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
among major oil producing states oklahoma saw the biggest gain 
with 19 additional rigs followed by louisiana six new mexico and 
pennsylvania two each and michigan and ohio one each 
texas posted the biggest decline for the week with six fewer 
rigs followed by wyoming california and kansas two each and 
colorado one north dakota was unchanged from the previous week

france angered by britains rejection of a 
single european currency and central bank threatened monday to 
renege on an agreement that forms part of the drive for a united 
european market by 1992 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher refused at the opening 
session of a twoday summit to embrace a plan for a tight monetary 
union of the 12 nations of the european economic community 
her opposition prompted french president francois mitterrand to 
threaten to renege on promises for more liberalized money markets 
if there is no agreement as a totality then countries who 
are committed to lifting exchange controls could be led to revise 
their position a french spokesman quoted mitterrand as saying in 
the closeddoor session 
spanish officials worked late monday trying to win backing for a 
fourpoint compromise proposal to submit to the leaders tuesday the 
final day of the semiannual summit 
its most controversial point seeks backing for moves to create a 
common central bank 
the leaders had gone into the summit at odds over key parts of 
the plan supported most enthusiastically by france west germany 
and spain and opposed by britain 
this split surfaced in their daylong closeddoor talks 
the rough work was in the hands of president mitterrand who 
said it quite strongly while the nuances were with west german 
chancellor helmut kohl said dutch prime minister ruud lubbers 
kohl urged his colleagues to accept the farreaching changes 
mrs thatcher said she supported closer monetary and economic 
cooperation but objected to the two subsequent stages that would 
lead to a single central bank and a common currency in the trading 
bloc 
decisions on these matters are simply not on the current 
agenda a british official quoted mrs thatcher as telling other 
leaders during the closeddoor session we must stick to the 
practical and go for what needs to be done now 
britain was backed at times by the netherlands portugal and 
luxembourg 
the moves for monetary union have added a new dimension to the 
eecs plans to fashion a single market by the end of 1992 by that 
date the nations want to remove the many trade barriers that 
prevent the free movement of people goods services and money 
officials said there was general agreement the 12 nations should 
cooperate more in economic and monetary matters 
we commit ourselves to the goal of the economic and monetary 
union process said the british official what we have not 
committed ourselves to is a process as defined in the report 
as part of endorsing a first stage of the plan which would begin 
in july 1990 mrs thatcher pledged to link the pound to the other 
major european currencies by joining the exchange rate mechanism of 
the european monetary system 
but mrs thatcher said britain would join the system only if 
britains 83 percent inflation rate was reduced significantly 
other eec nations abolished controls on their currencies by july 
1990 and europe provides for an open market in banking and financial 
services 
only the currencies of britain greece and portugal are not full 
members 
eec members are britain belgium france germany denmark 
luxembourg spain greece italy portugal the netherlands and 
ireland

the supreme court ruled monday that federal 
antiracketeering law is not just aimed at mobsters making it 
easier to use the statute in lawsuits against businesses being sued 
for fraud 
the court unanimously reinstated a lawsuit against northwestern 
bell telephone co by minnesota consumers the civil suit accused 
the utility of violating the federal racketeer influenced and 
corrupt organizations act or rico 
congress may have passed the rico law because of the perceived 
need to combat organized crime justice william j brennan said 
for the court but congress for cogent reasons chose to enact a 
more general statute one which although it had organized crime as 
its focus was not limited in application to organized crime 
in another case the high court agreed to set guidelines on when 
employers may withdraw recognition of a labor union after hiring new 
workers to break a strike 
the rico case which accused northwestern bell of bribing state 
public utility officials had been dismissed by the 8th us circuit 
court of appeals 
the appeals court ruled that the phone companys customers failed 
to prove a pattern of racketeering activity required to make a 
case under rico 
the consumers claim that the utility began in 1981 illegal 
attempts to win rate increases by offering gifts employment and 
other favors to members of the minnesota public utilities commission 
the 8th circuit said a single fraudulent scheme is insufficient 
ruling that at least two schemes must be alleged 
but brennan rejected that argument saying that to prove a 
pattern of racketeering activity a private plaintiff or a 
prosecutor must show at least two criminal acts within a single 
scheme that were related and that amounted to or threatened the 
likelihood of continued criminal activity 
other federal appeals courts have allowed civil rico suits based 
on numerous acts advancing only one fraudulent scheme 
rico claims are often found in lawsuits involving virtually any 
business dispute the stigma attached to being linked in public 
court documents to alleged racketeering can be powerful leverage for 
outofcourt settlements 
winners of rico cases may collect triple damages and lawyer fees 
which generally are not available under state antifraud laws 
justice department lawyers in court papers submitted last year 
sided with the phone customers urging a broad interpretation of the 
rico law 
also backing the customers were 14 states arizona california 
connecticut idaho michigan new jersey new mexico north 
carolina oregon texas washington west virginia wisconsin and 
wyoming 
but other interests urged the high court to bar the lawsuit the 
aflcio for example said that private civil rico actions have 
become a tool of harassment against legitimate businesses and 
labor organizations 
in the strikebreaker case the court agreed to hear a bush 
administration appeal of a ruling stemming from a 1979 strike 
against a texas laboratory supplies company 
curtin matheson scientific inc was struck in 1979 by workers at 
its houston warehouse after a union contract expired and the company 
locked out all 27 teamsters union members employed there 
five of the 27 employees crossed the picket line when the strike 
began june 13 1979 and 12 days later the company hired 29 new 
employees to replace the remaining 22 strikers 
when the union later offered to end the strike under terms 
previously offered by management the company withdrew the offer 
along with its recognition of the union as the workers bargaining 
agent 
the national labor relations board in 1987 said the company 
illegally withdrew its recognition of the union but the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals overruled the board last november 
in other decisions announced monday the high court 
ruled 72 that skyrocketing punitive damages awards in 
personal injury lawsuits do not violate the constitutions ban on 
excessive fines the decision left open the possibility that such 
hefty awards violate dueprocess rights 
ordered a lower court to restudy a dispute over drug and alcohol 
testing for transit workers employed by the southeastern 
pennsylvania transportation authority 
decided to review a decision requiring ws kirkpatrick amp co a 
new jersey corporation to defend itself against allegations that it 
bribed nigerian government officials to win a contract to develop an 
aeromedical center 
let stand a ruling that cbs inc no longer enjoys trademark 
protection for the amos n andy radio and television shows

next monday in london 
the ico composed of 74 major coffeeproducing and consuming 
nations attempts to control coffee prices by limiting the amount of 
coffee that each producer country may sell to the consumers

6year agreement will expire sept 30 without a pact to succeed it 
leaving coffee prices open to freemarket forces for the first time 
since 1963 
ico members will consider two proposals next week one to extend 
the current agreement with no change in quotas and the other to 
extend the agreement with changes to increase the availability of 
mild arabica coffees the type most in demand 
the two proposals are expected to be voted on but both are 
expected to be rejected said sandra kaul a coffeemarket analyst 
in new york with shearson lehman hutton inc

quotas other producer countries will approve it and coffee will 
flood the market

toy executive stephen d hassenfeld 
chairman and chief executive of hasbro inc was praised monday as 
unequaled among his peers but his death left questions about the 
companys future 
hassenfeld 47 died of pneumonia and cardiac arrest sunday night 
at columbia presbyterian hospital where he had been hospitalized 
for four weeks said hasbro spokesman wayne charness 
i believe that within the next year you will see the company 
sold its an attractive property in the industry said paul 
valentine an analyst at standard amp poors corp 
valentine said he expected hassenfelds family which owns 131 
percent of the pawtucketbased toymaker eventually would reexamine 
its position 
with stephen gone and the company now a larger more 
bureaucratic organization the fun has probably gone out of this 
business for the hassenfeld family he said 
valentine estimated the sale price at 32 per share but higher 
if the company performs better than expected this year 
hasbro common stock closed at 2225 up 25 cents on the 
american exchange monday its volume of nearly 12 million shares 
made it the second most heavily traded issue on the exchange 
but said analyst walter kirchberger at painewebber group inc 
stephens absence doesnt mean the company is without a leader 
thats not to say that stephen wont be missed but there are 
competent and qualified people to run the company 
charness did not know when hasbro directors would meet to select 
a successor hasbro president alan hassenfeld 40 who is 
hassenfelds brother has run the company in combination with a team 
of senior management 
we continue as we have for the last month charness said 
hassenfeld built hasbro into a toy giant with more than 13 
billion in sales from wellknown products including gi joe 
transformers my little pony and mr potato head the companys 
revenue was just 102 million 10 years ago 
hassenfeld bought companies such as the milton bradley co in 
1984 and developed a diverse line of lowcost products although the 
company last year scrapped plans for an interactive video and 
electronic game system called nemo after reportedly spending 
millions of dollars on research and development 
hasbro recently announced it would acquire assets of financially 
troubled coleco industries of avon conn maker of cabbage patch 
kids and other toys 
stephen hassenfield stands out virtually without a peer in the 
toy industry over the past 10 years he created what i refer to as 
the modern american toy company a broadly based well diversified 
toy company valentine said 
hassenfeld who was born in providence joined hasbro in 1964 and 
was named executive vice president of marketing and elected to the 
board of directors in 1968 he became president in 1974 and chairman 
in 1980 
in mid1987 hassenfeld was treated also at columbia 
presbyterian for what he later said was endocarditis a bacterial 
infection of the heart valve and lining 
his brother said hassenfeld never fully recovered from the heart 
infection partly because he was allergic to antibiotics used to 
treat the illness 
word of hassenfelds illness a month ago prompted heavy trading 
in hasbro stock 
at the time john t oneill hasbros chief financial officer 
dismissed rumors of a hostile takeover the hassenfeld family owns 
131 percent of the company stock and warner communications owns 
136 percent in a voting trust controlled by the hassenfeld 
brothers hasbro has the right of first refusal to purchase warners 
stock 
nevertheless hasbro adopted a poison pill earlier this month 
which would give existing shareholders the right to by additional 
stock in the event of a hostile takeover

five northrop corp executives are retiring or 
being reassigned as part of a streamlining program that includes the 
previously announced elimination of 2500 to 3000 rankandfile 
jobs 
the moves announced monday come as the company faces 
congressional efforts to cut spending on its premier program the 
b2 stealth bomber and as longtime chief executive thomas v jones 
transfers power to his successor 
retiring are two senior vice presidents cr bob gates 64 
who headed international marketing and joseph p gallagher 52 in 
charge of programs gallagher will leave active management but 
continue as a consultant on fighter plane development the company 
said 
three vicepresidents jobs under gallagher are being cut said 
spokesman tony cantafio 
the company has previously said that it would cut its workforce 
by 2500 to 3000 by the end of the year the main reason given for 
the cuts is that the b2 is moving from development to production 
and fewer workers are required 
jones the chairman and chief executive who will pass ceos 
responsibilities at the end of the year to kent kresa president and 
chief operating officer told stockholders earlier this year to 
expect changes in management ranks 
one industry analyst john simon of seidler amdec securities inc 
in los angeles saw the changes as moves by kresa to put his own 
stamp on management 
theres nothing unusual here simon said these are the 
kinds of things that happen when a new guy comes in 
another analyst paul nisbet of prudentialbache securities inc 
in new york said elimination of foreign marketing hierarchy makes 
sense since the company has less overseas business than in the past 
it is ending production of the f5 fighter plane sold to foreign 
air forces and electronics sales also are slower overseas than 
previously 
the three other executives leaving or being reassigned are jaime 
oaxaca vice president of total quality management retiring in 
july robert d lovell vice president of manufacturing who will go 
on special assignment to the b2 division and lou carrier vice

international economic forecasting and consulting firm by mutual 
consent the parent company said monday 
wefa group the parent company said chimerines job had been 
eliminated and the us subsidiary would report to an executive 
committee as other subsidiaries do it said chimerine would 
maintain a limited association with the firm as a senior economic 
adviser and keep his office 
wefa group of bala cynwyd pa was formed by the merger of 
wharton econometric forecasting associates inc and chase 
econometrics inc in 1987 and is owned by wef associates of basel 
switzerland 
there was a changing environment and larry decided he wanted to 
pursue other things gerard vila the wefa group chairman said in 
an interview

the us operation because the firm had become multinational and he 
said clients were demanding comprehensive business data and advice 
as opposed to narrowly defined macroeconomic forecasting 
forecasting is chimerines specialty 
chimerine said he was prevented from discussing the reasons for 
his departure and called it a long story he said his plans were 
uncertain but would include outside speaking and consulting work 
im delighted he said ive been thinking of doing other 
things for a long time and this will give me an opportunity to do

a nonsmokers organization is fired up over a 
cigarette manufacturers campaign to have pittsburgh restaurants 
post signs declaring smokers and nonsmokers are welcome 
bill godshall spokesman for the association for nonsmokers 
rights of pennsylvania filed a complaint with the federal trade 
commission against philip morris cos inc for failing to include 
the us surgeon generals tobacco warning in ads promoting 
accommodation the new sign of the times 
the nations largest cigarette manufacturer placed ads in 
newspapers and billboards advising people to look for a 
redandgreen emblem at restaurants showing that they have 
designated areas for smokers and nonsmokers 
godshall on monday condemned the campaign as an attempt to 
encourage people to smoke 
but philip morris spokesman les zuke said the campaign is a way 
for the business owner to convey a special message to his 
customers 
zuke said ftc rules require cigarette manufacturers to print the 
surgeon generals warning that smoking can be dangerous to a 
persons health on their products and in their ads he said ads for 
the pittsburgh campaign promote an idea not tobacco 
we wouldnt bring a campaign to pittsburgh without checking 
first he said were promoting rights for smokers and 
nonsmokers courtesy and tolerance 
more than 170 restaurants have agreed to display the emblem he 
said in exchange the restaurants are mentioned in advertisements 
appearing in the pittsburgh area over four months 
we are not paying them anything at all zuke said 
half of the sign contains a smoking cigarette against a 
background of green the nonsmoker half of the sign is red 
philip morris said it chose pittsburgh to launch the campaign 
because of the number of letters it said it received from customers 
confused by a smoking ordinance that took effect last year more 
customers wrote from pittsburgh than from any other city that 
restricts smoking in public places zuke said

the head of the coal miners union on 
monday accepted a new unconditional offer from gov gaston caperton 
for talks aimed at ending a union walkout and related wildcat 
strikes by nearly 43000 miners 
but the chairman of coal company that is the object of the unrest 
said hes tied up with jury duty this week 
also monday a federal judge in virginia fined the union 240000 
for its strike tactics against pittston while a federal judge in 
clarksburg refused to order strikers back to work 
wildcat strikes in sympathy with united mine workers strike 
against the pittston co continued monday in west virginia 
illinois pennsylvania alabama ohio indiana kentucky virginia 
and tennessee however most umw members began their twoweek 
vacations this week and the coal fields have been relatively quiet 
since the weekend 
about 350 umw members in missouri ended their wildcat strike 
monday and called on caperton to help end the unions dispute with 
pittston they also asked him to bring a halt to violence that 
erupted on picket lines in the past week 
in addition a federal judge in charleston reset hearings on 
whether to bar more wildcat strikes and find miners in contempt for 
ignoring his backtowork orders 
caperton invited pittston chairman paul douglas and umw president 
richard trumka last week to meet at the governors mansion and hash 
out a contract trumka accepted 
but caperton tacked on four conditions that led douglas to reject 
it that both sides negotiate in good faith that pittston not use 
any other coal companies to fill its orders that the union end all 
wildcat strikes and that other companies suing the umw because of 
the strikes suspend their litigation 
on monday caperton dropped the conditions and reissued the offer 
trumka again accepted 
douglas declined to say if he would accept adding he has been 
called for jury duty in new york this week however douglas said 
from pittston headquarters in greenwich conn any communication 
we get from the governor will get due consideration 
pittston has said its last contract offer made june 9 will be 
its best after the umw rejected that offer pittston declared an 
impasse and imposed its own contract at its operations 
about 1600 umw miners in virginia and west virginia went on 
strike against pittston on april 5 after working for 14 months 
without a contract they were joined by 300 kentucky miners earlier 
this month 
that strike spurred sympathy walkouts around the coal fields 
since june 12 when the wildcat strikes began 43000 miners in 10 
states have gone off the job 
figures released monday by the us energy information 
administration show that national coal production fell 12 million 
tons from 195 million to 183 million in the week following the 
start of the wildcat strikes 
caperton said his offer to be host of negotiations has improved 
the atmosphere in the coal fields 
it has evidenced itself in the form of a calmer gentler 
atmosphere in our coal fields a sense that something versus nothing 
is being done he said 
a teenager was grazed with a bullet on a west virginia picket 
line last week and pickets at a kentucky mine overturned a jeep 
being ridden by a company official shots also have been fired at 
mines in alabama 
in charleston us district judge dennis knapp reset a hearing 
for july 3 on five coal companies request that the umw and its 
members be held in contempt for ignoring his backtowork orders 
knapps office also said the judge has reset for july 11 a hearing 
on 13 companies request that he issue a preliminary injunction to 
halt wildcat walkouts in west virginia virginia ohio and kentucky 
both of those hearings originally were set for last friday 
in abingdon va us district judge glen williams ruled that 
daily convoys on coal hauling roads are being orchestrated by the 
union and violate his order prohibiting the umw from blocking the 
movement of coal trucks 
williams found the umw and two officials in contempt of court and 
issued fines totaling 240000 
in clarksburg us district judge william kidd denied 
consolidation coal cos request that he order its union miners back 
to work in monongalia marion and harrison counties kidd also 
dissolved a temporary restraining order against picketing at the 
mines 
and in another court development in kentucky pittstons eastern 
coal co subsidiary subpoenaed an associated press correspondents 
film of a union rally as part of a civil suit it has filed against 
the umw

about 200 people crowded into a federal courtroom 
monday to protest general motors corps proposed settlement of a 
discrimination suit 
us district judge john feikens told the black workers he would 
consider their objections to the settlement and make a decision in 
the case soon said napoleon quick jr a spokesman for the 
concerned black salaried employees of general motors 
the group last week called for the black community to boycott gm 
products until it wins a more favorable settlement in the suit 
first filed in 1983 by four salaried black gm workers 
the suit was certified in 1986 as a class action on behalf of 
10000 such workers in michigan ohio and indiana if accepted the 
settlement would amount to 20 million to 40 million over the next 
five years for the plaintiffs their attorneys have said 
the proposal is grossly inadequate and calls for setting up a 
doublemodel standard to monitor black salaries versus white which 
represents a problem in itself said quick 52 of detroit a 
former gm personnel administrator 
quick said the automakers proposal to monitor black workers pay 
and promotion for five years and to assess that information using 
computer models for comparable white employees establishes a double 
standard 
gm also has offered to pay cash settlements to some workers and 
raise the salaries of othes but the automaker does not admit to 
discriminating against blacks in pay and promotions

ford motor co said monday that it will idle its 
chicago and atlanta assembly plants for a third week after their 
normal twoweek summer shutdown this year 
the week of july 17 will be added to both plants normal twoweek 
shutdown for changeover from production of 1989 to 1990model 
automobiles ford spokesman joel pitcoff said 
the extended shutdown resulted from a delay in obtaining parts 
for 1990 models with new passive restraint systems and wasnt meant 
to reduce inventories pitcoff said 
the chicago plant employs about 2300 hourly employees and the 
atlanta plant employs about 2150 both produce the popular ford 
taurus and mercury sable automobiles 
ford has about a 54day supply of taurus cars and a 59day supply 
of sable cars on hand compared with a normal 65day inventory at 
this time of year pitcoff said 
pitcoff was quoted by the new york times in tuesdays editions as 
saying that the parts delay caused the company to delay the start of 
1990 production by a week at each plant 
because of the delay ford asked its dealers to buy an extra 
weeks worth of 1989 models but the dealers balked because the 
company already had begun taking orders for the 1990 models the 
dealers reluctance prompted the company to shut the plants for an 
extra week
