curbing future use of chemical weapons not judging 
events in the past is the purpose of a meeting of more than 140 
countries beginning this weekend foreign minister roland dumas said 
wednesday 
but the united states is widely expected to make an issue of its 
allegations that libya has built a large chemical weapons plant 
the conference opening saturday follows the downing of two 
libyan jet fighters by us navy planes on wednesday 
the conference also may become a forum for disputes between iran 
and iraq following iraqs use of chemical weapons in the eightyear 
persian gulf war iraq said it used chemical weapons after iran did 
but iran has denied using them 
speaking at a news conference dumas said france hopes the 
fiveday conference will not deviate from its agenda after the 
incident he also said the meeting should avoid reviewing past 
chemical weapons deployment 
the paris conference must not judge past acts dumas said 
the aim of the conference is to reaffirm the 1925 geneva protocol 
banning the use of chemical weapons and give impetus to negotiations 
in geneva on a universal ban on use and production of chemical arms 
javier perez de cuellar the un secretarygeneral will attend 
the conference un officials said 
william burns the us arms control director told reporters in 
washington on wednesday that the american delegation will focus on 
trying to strengthen the secretarygenerals authority to 
investigate allegations of chemical weapons use and authorize the 
un general assembly or security council to impose sanctions 
but burns said this could be difficult since all actions at the 
conference will be taken by consensus this means a single 
participant such as libya could hold off an overwhelming majority 
the us government accuses libya of having built a chemical 
weapons plant in the desert town of rabta 35 miles south of its 
capital tripoli president reagan last month said a military strike 
on the plant was under consideration 
libya says the plant in question produces pharmaceuticals 
west german radio quoted the foreign ministry as saying the west 
german ambassador in tripoli met wednesday with libyan leader col 
moammar gadhafi to discuss ways for an international commission to 
inspect the rabta plant 
us officials have said they suspect that a west german company 
helped build the chemical plant 
hansdietrich genscher west germanys foreign minister told 
reporters in bonn before the attack that his government was 
investigating the firm imhausenchemie but that it had no 
independent verification of the us claims that it supplied libya 
with materials for the plant 
britains foreign office said wednesday night it had independent 
information confirming the plant was built to produce chemical 
weapons it was britains first comment on the us allegations 
on wednesday two american f14s shot down two libyan jet 
fighters us government officials said the navy jets were 
conducting routine operations and had been threatened 
us defense secretary frank carlucci denied the action was 
related to the earlier accusation concerning the chemical weapons 
plant 
dumas said it was too soon for all the facts on the air skirmish 
to be known and that france awaited the libyan version of the 
events 
dumas said france did not have enough information to decide 
whether the libyan plant was capable of producing chemical weapons 
the conference was formally proposed by president reagan during 
his september address to the un general assembly

cuban president fidel castro on wednesday said 
the first of 3000 cuban troops in angola will return home tuesday 
the official prensa latina news agency reported 
castro also warned that a plan to cut the number of un 
peacekeeping troops in neighboring namibia would permit south africa 
to install a puppet government in that country also known as 
southwest africa 
we will fulfill our obligations before the first of april 
castro said in a dispatch monitored in mexico city he was referring 
to the deadline for the pullout of the first 3000 cuban troops from 
angola under a usbrokered peace accord 
angola cuba and south africa signed a treaty dec 22 calling for 
the withdrawal of the 50000strong cuban force from angola within 
30 months half of them by nov 1 
castro said a proposal to reduce the size of a un peacekeeping 
force in namibia from 7500 to 3000 troops would enable south 
africa to maintain a powerbrokers role in namibia and complicate 
the cuban pullout from angola 
difficulties have arisen in enacting the accord for the 
independence of namibia for which swapo has fought many years 
spilling the blood of many of its combatants castro said 
referring to the acronym for the southwest african peoples 
organization nationalist movement 
taking into account the growth of the south african forces 
in namibia the reduced number of un troops could not guarantee 
these goals and would benefit south african plans to install a 
titular government in the country castro declared he said cuba 
had made its concerns known to the un security council 
castros complaints echoed those made by sam nujoma leader of 
swapo earlier wednesday in havana the cuban capital 
castro suggested that other african nations including nigeria 
ethiopia and tanzania contribute troops to the un force prensa 
latina said 
cuba sent troops to angola in 1975 to help the marxist government 
fight invading south african troops and usbacked rebels of the 
rightwing national union of the total independence of angola 
called unita

us navy jet fighters shot down two libyan 
mig23 jets wednesday after the americans were approached at high 
speed in what defense secretary frank c carlucci called a hostile 
manner in international airspace over the mediterranean sea 
carlucci said the two american f14 tomcat jets acted solely in 
selfdefense based on preliminary reports the sovietbuilt libyan 
jets activated their weapontargeting radar before the us jets 
opened fire with their airtoair missiles he said 
carlucci denied that the jets assigned to the aircraft carrier 
uss john f kennedy were airborne to participate in a military 
strike on a disputed chemical weapons production plant inside libya 
president reagan now oppposes a us military strike against the 
plant because it would cause an international furor that might harm 
other us interests the washington post reported in thursdays 
editions 
carlucci said the carrier was only crossing the mediterranean 
toward a port call and conducting routine operations when the 
incident occurred at midday local time about 5 am est 
the us planes each carrying two crewmen returned without 
incident to their carrier and were then flown to naples italy for 
debriefing carlucci said the fate of the two libyan pilots 
remained unclear although he said two parachutes were sighted 
and a rescue helicopter was later seen in the area 
it was the first military confrontation between the united states 
and libya since a us bombing raid over tripoli in 1986 that raid 
came after the reagan administration said it had conclusive evidence 
that libyan leader moammar gadhafi was behind a terrorist bombing 
attack in west germany 
reagan on vacation in los angeles was awakened about an hour 
after the downing and told of the incident by lt gen colin l 
powell his national security adviser in a phone call said white 
house spokesman roman popadiuk 
the spokesman said he had no information on reagans reaction 
except to say that the president considers the incident closed 
in washington at a pentagon briefing carlucci echoed that we 
now consider this matter closed 
libyas foreign ministry called it a premeditated attack by 
us forces and said it would seek an emergency meeting of the un 
security council 
presidentelect bush was told of the incident by phone at 6 am 
wednesday by the white house situation room according to 
spokeswoman sheila tate hes being kept informed throughout the 
day she added 
senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga said 
the us jets were acting defensively and the libyan planes had 
maneuvered themselves into a position of attack and they did it on 
two occasions 
that violates the rules of engagement that we have common 
understanding on in the international environment nunn said 
you cannot in this day and time and modern technology wait until 
another plane has fired in order to defend yourself its too late 
then 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said the downing 
appeared to be selfdefense pure and simple 
gadhafi never learns dole said maybe this time he will 
finally get it straight whenever he threatens american forces we 
will defend ourselves 
carlucci said the libyan jets were shot down in selfdefense by 
american f14s with airtoair missiles 
the defense secretary said the migs were detected shortly after 
they left al bumbah airfield and were tracked the us pilots he 
added maneuvered to avoid the closing aircraft they changed 
speed altitude and direction 
the libyan aircraft continued to close in a hostile manner at 
about 14 miles the us section leader decided his aircraft was in 
jeopardy and they could wait no longer one mig23 was shot down 
with a sparrow missile the second mig was shot down by a sidewinder 
missile at six miles 
the incident occurred well off the libyan coast in international 
airspace carlucci said the aircraft carrier was about 127 miles 
north of tobruk libya while the two f14s were about 70 miles 
north of the coast 
a navy e2c hawkeye radar surveillance plane was airborne with 
the two tomcat fighters and monitored the action said one pentagon 
official who asked not to be identified 
it was all routine until these guys the libyans took off and 
headed straight for the f14s the source added 
based on our current information the us pilots 
descended in altitude from approximately 15000 feet to 4000 feet 
and they took some five different evasive actions carlucci said 
each time the libyan aircraft sought to put their nose on our 
aircraft they also accelerated so the hostile intent seems to be 
fairly clear he said 
carlucci said there was some preliminary information that 
radars were turned on 
in rome libyas ambassador to italy abdel rahman shalgam 
called wednesdays incident a unilateral act and a dangerous 
action he declined to say how libya would respond 
the libyan foreign ministry said that as libyan reconnaissance 
aircraft were carrying out a patrol over international waters us 
aircraft carried out a premeditated attack on them and shot them 
down 
libyas official jana news agency said the foreign ministry 
ordered its united nations representative to present an urgent 
complaint to the security council concerning the aggression 
perpetrated by the usa against two libyan reconnaissance planes 
and to demand the holding of an urgent security council meeting 
on this subject 
last month in a television interview reagan said administration 
officials had debated a military attack on a newly constructed plant 
that libya is preparing to produce chemical weapons but added 
that is a decision that has not been made yet 
libya claims the plant will make pharmaceuticals and gadhafi has 
charged the united states is using the allegations of chemical 
weapon production as a pretext to attack his country 
carlucci insisted wednesday the kennedy and its air wing had no 
designs on the chemical weapons plant 
this has nothing whatsoever to do with all the speculation and 
if i may say excessive speculation that has existed on the 
chemical plant carlucci said 
if you were going to make an attack on the chemical plant you 
would not position your carrier some 600 miles away i think thats 
self evident

earsplitting military training flights 
over this densely populated country became a major issue in west 
germany in 1988 because of a series of crashes and opponents have 
vowed to step up their campaign this year 
this selfimposed threat from the skies must end our populated 
areas must above all be safe erwin horn a federal lawmaker with 
the opposition social democrats said tuesday 
nato pilots resumed tactical flights over west germany on tuesday 
following a threeweek moratorium in memory of the victims of a dec 
8 crash of a us military jet on the northern city of remscheid 
five west germans and the us pilot were killed 
critics insist on more than a moratorium and say they will step 
up their pressure for nato forces in west germany to abandon 
lowlevel training flights in which planes fly at altitudes as low 
as 250 feet 
we want military lowlevel flights to stop permanently said 
werner mey head of the nationwide protest group coordination of 
opponents of lowlevel flights 
there will be a whole spectrum of protest actions this 
year mey said in a telephone interview from his home in 
biebelnheim near mainz 
the screeching of nato jets on lowflying training maneuvers is a 
frequent occurrence in west germany where air bases are scattered 
across the country there are about 400000 foreign nato troops in 
west germany more than half of them americans 
a series of military air crashes in 1988 has ignited widespread 
opposition among the west german populace to nato lowlevel training 
flights 
politicians from the social democratic party are among the most 
vocal opponents of the flights at times scolding the united states 
and other nato partners with warplanes here over the issue 
i appeal to the allies to stop their lowlevel flights and to 
carry out these flights at home said legislator albrecht mueller 
a social democrat 
he said west germanys nato partners should not expect german 
citizens to bear burdens that their own people are spared from 
the debate over whether to stop nato lowlevel training flights 
has been a divisive one 
polls indicate that nearly threequarters of all west germans 
want the flights to stop 
in fact observers note it can be politically dangerous to 
support lowlevel training flights 
whoever says lets reduce lowlevel flights is certain of 
meeting with approval the respected daily frankfurter allgemeine 
zeitung said in an editorial on tuesday 
government officials under public pressure say they want 
lowlevel flights reduced to a minimum but they insist the 
exercises are necessary for the proper training of nato pilots 
stationed in this country to offset possible threats from the east 
bloc 
defense minister rupert scholz has been targeted for harsh 
criticism during the dispute 
perhaps a defense minister is needed with more experience and 
more talent in balancing out military needs with citizens who are 
tormented by military flights the munich newspaper merkur 
said in a commentary 
the dispute over lowlevel jet training exercises is the central 
issue of a larger debate often targeting the prominent us 
military presence over whether west germans are truly masters of 
their own land 
the leftleaning frankfurter rundschau newspaper on tuesday 
published a story about what it called roundtheclock noise 
terror from us helicopter units based near frankfurt 
it said protests against the helicopter base at bonames near 
frankfurt have never been as loud as they are now 
the us armed forces have not appeared especially ready to 
cooperate in reducing the noise at the base the newspaper wrote 
the us government insists its military forces do nothing to 
limit west german sovereignty or to go against the wishes of the 
west german government 
but many leftists have charged that conservative west german 
officials wouldnt dare to thwart the will of us military 
officials 
horn in a list of demands on the defense minister said tuesday 
that german jurisprudence and german law should be put to use in 
order to work against the loss of sovereignty through nonuse 
the opposition party plans to begin a parliamentary initiative 
this month to examine whether west germanys sovereignty rights are 
in jeopardy and if so what can be done about it

the federal crime office says 662 
people died from drug abuse in west germany last year the highest 
number of drugrelated fatalities in the countrys history 
volker limburg head of the offices narcotics division said 
tuesday that the record death toll was in part attributable to the 
unusually high purity of some of the heroin being sold illegally in 
the country 
he said most addicts are accustomed to a more diluted form of the 
drug and that the 60 percent purity mix circulating has increased 
the risk of overdose 
on the other hand limburg said a sharp rise in impurities in 
some drugs also contributed to the unusually high death toll 
authorities have found gypsum or plaster being used to cut heroin 
by some dealers he said 
suicide through intentional overdosing was a third cause behind 
the high death toll which exceeded the 623 drugrelated deaths in 
1979 the previous record year limburg said 
the average age of the victims was 28 and heroin was most 
frequently the drug involved

freshman rep ronald k machtley was 
entertaining a small group of relatives lobbyists and other guests 
at his swearingin party tuesday when a man entered who received 
perhaps the most emotional greeting of all 
i have a xerox machine here said the custodian peering into 
machtleys longworth house office building suite 
grab him take it the congressman roared 
machtley could hardly be blamed for his desperation the office 
he inherited came with furniture but no typewriters copying 
machines or other equipment hardly the best way to get a running 
start in the 101st congress but a common situation for newcomers 
the rhode island republican is one of just 33 freshmen in the 
435member house but he comes to the job with more notoriety than 
most he was the only one of six challengers to defeat an incumbent 
in november and the only one to oust a committee chairman democrat 
fernand j st germain who headed the house banking panel 
machtley pronounced makely received his partys nomination 
only after a favored rival failed to file his declaration of 
candidacy in time for the primary 
his surprising 56 percent to 44 percent victory over the 14term 
veteran st germain came after the incumbent was battered with 
renewed attention to allegations that he received favors from 
lobbyists machtley had never before run for public office 
i accept that i wont go down there and turn congress 
upsidedown legislatively the 40yearold lawyer said last week 
from his office in newport ri but i have the educational 
background so that ill do a good job 
machtley a naval academy graduate who went on to become an 
attorney defeated st germain after a campaign in which he took 
popular positions in the overwhelmingly democratic district such as 
favoring a womans right to abortion and reduced spending on 
president reagans star wars missile defense program 
on tuesday his victorious campaign bore fruit as he officially 
took over as the congressman from rhode islands 1st congressional 
district 
actually machtley began savoring the perks of office even before 
he was sworn in 
look theres cooter he told his family during their walk to 
the swearingin ceremony in the capitol when he spied a fellow 
newcomer rep ben jones a georgia democrat best known for his 
portrayal on televisions the dukes of hazzard of the good ole 
boy cooter ive met him hes a nice guy 
machtley and his wife kati who for now are staying with their 
two children at a local hotel began their day working out in an 
exercise room at 8 am 
he was in his office an hour later joined by a few family 
members including his wife two children parents and 
motherinlaw the group crossed the street to the capitol to watch 
a twohour session of the house that culminated in members taking 
the oath of office 
its a real big deal concluded his 12yearold daughter 
erin 
then it was back to his longworth office where a small group of 
lobbyists staff and other lawmakers dined on cold cuts soda beer 
and wine and mingled with relatives who told of the days machtley 
while in the naval academy earned spare change by diving for balls 
in golf course ponds polishing them up and selling them 
i was the one who had to clean them said his younger sister 
susan carl 
above the din of the reception machtley juggled interviews with 
rhode island reporters and posed for photographs with his family it 
was all interrupted by a strange series of loud buzzes wellknown 
to the ears of capitol hill veterans 
what is that he asked his aides 
it was the signal used to summon members to the house floor for a 
vote

in their bid to win public support cuban 
authorities not only extol the virtues of socialism but also 
frequently use ridicule to try to discredit the purported evils of 
capitalism 
the other day the cuban communist party daily newspaper granma 
cited some of the horror toys sold during the christmas season 
in the united states as examples of the crude excesses of capitalism 
the article mentioned dolls that spew green vomit when squeezed 
and toy monsters with removable organs soaked in fake blood 
in addition the commentary said there are other objects so 
incredible and abominable that the most elemental good taste 
prevents their description in a newspaper 
what can be expected from that country where private property 
and the quest for profits are sacred and untouchable the 
commentary asked 
variations on the same theme accompany the rhetoric of president 
fidel castro in his defense of the cuban system 
castro has been especially strident lately he seems to sense 
that with the reformist trend in the soviet union and other 
communist countries few of those countries leaders are speaking 
out for ideological purity 
socialism or death marxismleninism or death the president 
said sunday night on the 30th anniversary of the revolution that 
ousted rightist dictator fulgencio batista and swept castro to power 
as cuban officials see it to dilute the socialist ethic would 
open the way to such capitalist ills as drug abuse and the aids 
epidemic 
cubas socialist model faces immense problems ranging from 
chronic product shortages to shoddy goods but castro still likes to 
compare revolutionary cuba with the usdominated prerevolutionary 
era 
he says 100000 cuban women were involved in prostitution during 
the 1950s and gambling casinos siphoned off the meager income of 
workers often leaving their children unfed 
the old system he says left 80 per cent of the cuban people 
semiliterate now he says virtually every worker is highly 
literate and politically aware 
the united states now has the literacy problem he says he adds 
that even a simple task like getting on the right bus can thwart 
some americans because they cant read the route signs 
capitalist societies says castro are marked by consumer 
anxiety and the quest for profit not by a zeal for resolving 
mankinds problems 
castro says he believes that under capitalism people start to 
believe they are entitled to more than they really need 
to make the point he sometimes resorts to exaggeration 
when somebody has enough to dress himself nicely he wants to 
change clothes every day he says when he can change clothes 
every day he wants to change in the morning at noon and in the 
afternoon and before going to bed also this is the system that 
governs capitalist societies 
these types of crazy luxuries castro says are common in 
rich countries that pillage poor ones 
at home castro has eased up a bit on some practices associated 
with capitalism tipping for example is now tolerated officials 
also allow moonlighting by carpenters and other skilled workers 
but two years ago castro acted decisively against what he 
regarded as more dangerous forms of capitalist penetration he 
discovered for example that some cubans were making huge sums off 
a 6yearold experiment under which farmers sold a portion of their 
goods at market rates 
castro abolished the program he said some enterprising cubans 
were making 20 times more than a cuban doctor who performs heart 
transplants

resolutions for a skinny new year were taken 
seriously by more than 30 people who attended a clinic at the 
university of illinois physicians office 
the clinic offered a free body analysis to people willing to hook 
themselves up to electrodes on tuesday 
the participants ranging from age 20 to 60 allowed doctors to 
apply metallic tape and clips to a hand and a foot so they could 
measure their body fat 
a lot of people make a vow to themselves at the beginning of 
the year to lose weight and especially coming off the holidays 
said mike maggio spokesman for the university of illinois hospital 
its a time for new years resolutions and coming off the 
goodies maggio said 
the electrodes send electric currents through the skin to measure 
the amount of tissue resistance said dr georgia andrianopoulos a 
director of the program 
because fat tissue conducts less than muscle tissue doctors can 
use the electrodes to calculate the percentage of body fat they 
also can determine the number of calories a person should consume to 
lower the fat ratio 
but does it hurt 
not at all said pam gaidelis 23 one of those who waited in 
line i was kind of scared seeing all the electrodes but you 
cant feel anything 
ms gaidelis said she already lost 40 pounds on her own through 
diet and exercise but is looking for a way to keep the fat off

physicians who treat women are being enlisted 
in a nationwide effort to aid battered women and help break a 
generational cycle that has caught some american families in a web 
of violence 
the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists is 
sending information to its 28000 members to heighten their 
awareness of the problem of domestic violence and better enable them 
to help abused women 
surgeon general c everett koop who joined the group for its 
announcement of the campaign tuesday said stopping violence against 
women is a major part of the effort to end family violence a cycle 
that often begins when someone is the victim of abuse and then grows 
up to become an abuser 
its obvious that if youre going to break that chain 
youve got to start with child abuse koop said but you cant 
just wait for the three generations to work themselves out youve 
got to take care of the elderly abused and youve got to take care 
of the battered women 
the physicians campaign is aimed at the estimated 15 million 
women who have been beaten raped or suffered other forms of 
physical and sexual assault a total that koop says grows by 1 
million a year 
it is an overwhelming moral economic and public health burden 
that our society can no longer bear koop said in this country 
no man has a license to beat and get away with it and no woman is 
obliged to accept a beating and suffer because of it 
koop noted that help is available from state and national 
coalitions and social service organizations law enforcement 
agencies and the courts and he encouraged doctors to become part of 
the crusade against violence 
we say we are a civilized society koop said all right 
lets act like one and lets stop the violence in our families and 
lets end the battering of women in this country 
koop said however he did not advocate mandatory reporting by 
doctors of abused women such reporting he said could further harm 
a woman by prompting retaliation against her or her children at a 
time when she may not have the financial means to leave her home 
the pamphlets and bulletins the group is sending to its members 
outline the physical signs of abuse and suggest to doctors how to 
discuss the problem with women who have been abused the written 
material includes information about womens legal rights social 
services that are available to women and strategies for helping 
women escape from abusive situations 
we are providing physicians with the tools they can use to help 
women escape from such a relationship said luella klein a former 
president of the physicians association we dont expect obgyns 
always to treat the pathology of battering but we expect them to 
tell women what their rights are under the law and advise a woman 
how to plan for dealing with her abusive partner 
women who have been abused will often have injuries on their 
head face neck chest abdomen breast or arms she said women 
who are abused when they are pregnant often have abdominal and 
breast injuries she added 
the doctors are also advised that abused women often complain 
about headaches insomnia choking sensations and stomach chest 
pelvic and back pains she said these women she added may appear 
shy frightened embarrassed evasive anxious or passive and often 
cry

backers of the equal rights amendment made it 
the first order of business for the new congress but say the real 
battleground for its adoption is in the state legislatures where it 
died in 1982 
our foremothers never gave up on the right to vote until we 
won and we will never give up on the equal rights amendment until 
we have won molly yard president of the national organization 
for women told a capitol hill news conference 
we are certainly not giving up said rep don edwards 
dcalif who was joined by 128 other house members in cosponsoring 
the era as house joint resolution 1 before the new congress as it 
convened on tuesday 
yard said the campaign for passage would concentrate on state 
legislatures where she said women would need to control onethird 
of the seats about twice the share they now hold to ensure the 
measures ratification 
its shocking to me that on the 200th anniversary of the 
constitution women are still not in it rep patricia schroeder 
dcolo said 
the nation celebrated the bicentennial of the signing and 
ratification of the constitution in 1987 and 1988 
the equal rights amendment which would prohibit sex 
discrimination came closest to passage nearly seven years ago 
having been approved by congress and 35 state legislatures the 
proposed amendment still needed approval by three more state 
legislatures when time for its ratification expired on june 30 1982 
it was reintroduced in congress in 1983 1985 and 1987 but did 
not win the twothirds support needed to be submitted to the states 
again the republican party has withdrawn its support for the 
proposed amendment and presidentelect bush who once supported the 
era also has changed his mind 
but yard said she remained hopeful that such a proposal would be 
adopted before the end of the century 
edwards said he was encouraged by the number of cosponsors of 
the proposal but said he did not know whether it would make it 
through congress this time

former white house chief of staff donald regan 
in a parting shot at president reagan says he hopes presidentelect 
bush has learned from reagans shortcomings 
in a paperback reissue of his insider book for the record 
due to be published feb 1 regan praised bush while inveighing 
oncemore against the management style of his former boss 
while saying he felt confident that bush had learned from 
reagans successes regan said he hoped the presidentelect has 
learned from reagans shortcomings his baffling reluctance to give 
orders or even guidance to his close subordinates and the 
tendency to permit some of his advisers to manage the presidency for 
effect rather than for results 
the reissue of regans book is scheduled to hit the newsstands 
and bookstores on feb 1 bush assumes the presidency on jan 20 
sheila tate a spokeswoman at bushs transition headquarters 
here said that to my knowledge he bush has not solicited 
advice from donald regan i do believe they have always had a 
cordial relationship 
a source in the bush transition office declining to be named 
publicly said that bush has not spoken with regan except during a 
chance encounter at burning tree country club a suburban maryland 
golf course 
the initial publication of regans book last spring caused a stir 
in washington as the former white house chief of staff depicted 
reagan as a laidback president who had difficulty making decisions 
and who didnt work hard 
reagan and his wife nancy denounced regan for telling the 
insider stories white house spokesman marlin fitzwater labeled 
regans work a kissandtell story in the mold of all books that 
seek to exploit the presidency or the first family for personal 
selfinterest 
during a questionandanswer session on dec 16 with students at 
the university of virginia reagan quipped at one point that 
somebodys talking to me about doing a book and there are some 
backstage stories that i might enjoy getting out 
in the new chapter that regan added to the reissue of his book 
published by st martins press inc in new york the former chief 
of staff also wrote that 
bush cannot survive politically if he reneges on his 
campaign promise to oppose increases in tax rates to cope with the 
federal budget deficit 
bush is no protectionist and predicted that the 
presidentelect will work to open markets abroad 
bush will almost certainly face the necessity of dealing with 
a recession perhaps in bushs first term 
as long as he listens to his own instincts and to the voice of 
his own experience the american people will be wellserved regan 
said 
he said that bush must bring the white houses relationship 
with the news media under control so that he and his people spend 
the greater part of their time dealing with the reality of the 
nations problems rather than catering to the natural tendency of 
the media to transform the presidency into entertainment 
bush in fact signaled last month that he will not follow 
reagans practice of allowing reporters to ask questions during 
white house picturetaking sessions with visiting foreign leaders

glasnost brought a little more color into the lives 
of soviet newspaper readers as izvestia heralded with a frontpage 
splash of green the opening of its pages to foreign advertisers 
for decades the same government daily had railed against 
capitalism in small gray type now it was introducing the western 
sales pitch 
french perfumes french wines and the french effort to find 
comfort have been wellknown to you for a long time proclaimed 
pechiney a french firm that bought all of page five in tuesdays 
groundbreaking edition now you have a chance to get more closely 
acquainted with industrial france 
in a frontpage announcement izvestia said the two pages of ads 
from european and us companies were the first in a weekly effort 
to give western businessmen the possibility to enter into direct 
dialogue with future soviet partners who are trying to set up 
contacts with the foreign market 
west germanys dresdner bank the first western bank to open an 
office in moscow in 1973 had a quarter of page six with a green 
stripe matching the splash of green on the eightpage papers front 
the ads represent a sharp turnabout for the central press soviet 
newspapers usually consist of four to six broad sheets of small type 
crammed from top to bottom of each page they have not accepted any 
advertising 
in recent years newspapers such as moscow news which is at the 
forefront of gorbachevs drive for greater openness and 
restructuring soviet society have begun publishing occasional ads 
for staterun enterprises 
in announcing an agreement oct 15 to cooperate on the 
advertising project with west germanys burda magazine izvestia 
called advertising the engine of trade 
staterun enterprises are freer under president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms to buy and sell on the world market in order to 
attract new technology but izvestia said they needed an open 
exchange of information with foreign firms 
there are completely new problems for us the paper said 
one of them and by far not the last is business information 
karl schlue moscow representative of the dresdner bank said he 
did not know precisely how much the advertising cost but that a 
full page was about 50000 payment is in hard currency which the 
average soviet cannot possess legally 
schlue said it was difficult to anticipate how often his company 
would advertise or what kind of results it expected 
other advertisers tuesday included armand hammers occidental 
petroleum monsanto and the munichbased mann firm most of the 
firms have permanent representatives in moscow and pechiney 
provided information about its joint project to build an aluminum 
factory in soviet armenia 
the foreign ads in izvestia almost exclusively explained the 
companies business in simple type with few illustrations there was 
no change in the format of the rest of the paper 
izvestia said that for the time being the advertising will be 
carried once a week in papers distributed in moscow and abroad that 
will make up not less than 600000 of the papers total distribution 
of about 9 million copies 
it said the advertising would stress industrial and scientific 
products to help bolster the soviet economy rather than foreign 
consumer goods that are not for sale in the soviet union and cannot 
be purchased with consumers nonconvertible rubles 
staterun firms also are free to advertise on izvestias pages 
and one placed an ad in tuesdays edition 
the hydromechanization trust of the ministry of energy and 
electrification said it was prepared to work together with foreign 
companies on industrial projects across the soviet union 
but ads for aeroflot the staterun airline or items in constant 
deficit such as toothpaste and tights will not appear izvestia said 
in the oct 15 edition nor it said will ads for the latest 
model of mercedes suits by cardin or invitations to vacation in 
fiji

the massive amount of classified information 
pervading the irancontra case is threatening again to delay this 
months scheduled start of former presidential aide oliver l 
norths criminal trial 
a federal appeals court tuesday temporarily stayed pretrial 
review of norths plans to divulge classified information when his 
lawyers question high government officials in open court 
and the federal judge in the case gerhard a gesell on tuesday 
turned down a request to further censor classified documents 
prosecutors want to use as evidence to accommodate objections of 
intelligence agencies 
the decision by the us circuit court of appeals here to 
consider norths motion to permanently bar gesell from giving 
prosecutors a summary of the proposed defense testimony could force 
a delay in the trial now set for jan 31 
north is charged along with former national security adviser john 
m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and richard v secord 
with conspiring to illegally divert more than 14 million in 
usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
the threejudge appeals panel issued an indefinite 
administrative stay of gesells plan to give independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh the 162page defense summary while it considers 
what the defense called grave constitutional issues involving 
norths right to a fair trial 
gesell meanwhile refused walshs request to make more editing 
changes in the 300 prosecution exhibits 
us intelligence agencies are concerned that sensitive 
references in the documents that cover some 3000 pages could 
disclose covert operations or secret dealings with foreign nations 
a ranking administration official said it was too early to assess 
the full impact of gesells ruling on the case against north 
but gesells latest decision was a fresh reminder that government 
refusal to disclose certain classified information at trial could 
scuttle major charges against the former white house aide 
under the classified information procedures act the attorney 
general can decide to seek dismissal of criminal charges to prevent 
disclosure of secrets that might endanger national security 
the administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the decision did not spell the end of the case against north 
but it could bar walsh from using some of the documents as evidence 
gesell for instance is insisting that the names of israel iran 
and the central american nations appear in any document despite a 
government proposal to refer to each nation by a letter 
this procedure was used during the 1987 congressional irancontra 
hearings even though the true identities of the countries quickly 
became an open secret 
gesell is known to have raised concerns at the cia and other 
agencies about his insistence that government reports be quoted 
verbatim with only a few modifications to protect sources and 
methods of intelligence gathering 
walshs request for a modification of gesells dec 12 order was 
filed under court seal dec 22 after the independent counsel had 
conferred with the white house and an interagency task force that is 
reviewing the classified information at issue 
north contends that gesells decision to let walsh look at the 
summary of his defense strategy will give prosecutors an unfair 
advantage before the case goes to trial 
lawyers for the former national security council aide described 
the document in court papers as a detailed road map to the defense 
case 
never has a criminal defendant been compelled to disclose 
before the prosecution has called its first witness the details of 
proposed defense testimony on virtually every disputed factual issue 
in this case the defense said in papers filed tuesday 
gesell had proposed to give walsh the summary by tuesday 
afternoon barring intervention from the appeals court the case 
before circuit judges kenneth starr james buckley and david 
sentelle is one of several issues that could delay the proceeding 
also looming on the horizon is norths attempt to subpoena 
president reagan and vice president bush to testify as witnesses 
justice department officials said tuesday that a motion to quash the 
subpoenas could be filed by weeks end 
the government is expected to resist the subpoenas based on the 
principle of separation of powers executive privilege and the need 
to protect classified information 
north meanwhile has subpoenaed other administration officials 
notably secretary of state george shultz and several of his top 
aides including assistant secretary of state elliott abrams 
undersecretary michael h armacost legal adviser abraham sofaer and 
m charles hill shultzs executive assistant

the effort by oliver north to compel president 
reagan and presidentelect bush to testify at his irancontra trial 
has renewed a debate almost as old as the union over executive 
privilege 
can a president or a former one be forced to testify in a legal 
case courts have provided little guidance but constitutional 
experts said tuesday that norths legal tactic may succeed 
no sitting president ever has testified in court in a criminal 
trial but several have provided testimony or what might be 
considered the equivalent 
the personal stakes are high for north the former white house 
aide is charged with theft conspiracy to defraud the government and 
several other felonies in the case involving the support of 
nicaraguan rebels with money from the sale of us weapons to iran 
his trial is scheduled to begin jan 31 just 11 days after bush 
is to succeed reagan besides reagan and bush subpoenas also have 
been issued for other key figures in the reagan administration 
including secretary of state george p shultz and four other state 
department officials 
the man who first tried to force a president to testify was aaron 
burr a former vice president who stood trial in 1807 on charges of 
treason 
burr sought to force thomas jefferson the president under whom 
he had served to testify at the trial 
jefferson resisted but chief justice john marshall presiding 
over the trial ruled against jefferson the president eventually 
avoided having to appear by releasing some information burr had 
sought 
the closest the supreme court has come to ruling on the issue 
presented by norths subpoena came in the watergate tapes decision 
of 1974 in a case called nixon vs us 
the court then ruled 80 that president richard m nixon had to 
comply with a special prosecutors subpoena seeking the surrender of 
white house tape recordings 
the general assertion of privilege must yield to the 
demonstrated specific need for evidence in a pending criminal 
trial the high court ruled 15 years ago 
jerome barron a law professor at george washington university 
here said tuesday the 1974 decision is a strong precedent for north 
whether mr reagan or mr bush can be subpoenaed was resolved 
in nixon vs us and the answer is yes barron said 
if the evidence sought by north is material i think reagan 
and bush can be required to appear barron said 
on the other hand unnamed justice department sources were quoted 
by the washington post as saying that nixon vs us offers support 
for fighting subpoenas of reagan and bush they said the supreme 
court emphasized that its watergatetapes decision did not deal with 
a claim of privilege based on national security grounds 
justice department and white house officials have said they will 
try to have the subpoenas thrown out 
stanley brand a washington lawyer who once served as general 
counsel to the house of representatives said north may succeed 
my sense is north has a good claim the president was involved 
in the process and one of norths defenses is that he was serving 
the president by following orders brand said 
in 1975 thenpresident gerald r ford gave a videotaped 
deposition in the trial of lynette squeaky fromme who was 
convicted of trying to assassinate ford the videotape was played 
for jurors at frommes trial 
while in office president jimmy carter provided videotaped 
testimony in two criminal prosecutions

memo to michael dukakis if youre thinking of 
making another run at the presidency in 1992 check the record only 
once in this century has a defeated presidential nominee won the 
office on his second try 
that one was richard nixon 
dukakis announced in boston tuesday that he wont try for a 
fourth term as governor of massachusetts when this one ends in 1990 
he did not drop the other shoe whether he will make another run at 
the presidency or on the other extreme get out of politics 
altogether 
he acknowledged however that it is very difficult to run for 
the presidency as an incumbent governor 
dukakis would have plenty of company among presidential aspirants 
who subscribe to the if at first you dont succeed school of 
politics the record is fat with candidates of the harold stassen 
stripe who dont take a dearth of votes for a hint 
ronald reagan sought the republican partys presidential 
nomination in 1968 1972 and 1976 before finally getting it in 1980 
george bush had tried in 1980 too 
but when a candidate gets the nomination and then loses his 
party is loath to let him try again the modern exceptions are 
william jennings bryan who was nominated three times twice in this 
century thomas dewey and adlai stevenson there were boomlets for 
a third nomination for dewey in 1952 and stevenson in 1960 but they 
came to nought 
after serving twice as vice president in the dwight eisenhower 
administration nixon ran and lost in 1960 against john f kennedy 
he spent a good part of the next eight years collecting republican 
ious with almost ceaseless speechmaking and was nominated again in 
1968 
losing a presidential election is more often than not a fast 
slide into political oblivion for the candidate 
gerald ford who became vice president and then president without 
benefit of elections tried for a full term on his own and was 
defeated by jimmy carter in 1976 he remains one of the most visible 
former presidents because of his affinity for celebrity golf 
tournaments ford also turned into a oneman corporation lending 
his name to boards of directors lecturing for fees of 15000 and 
more entering into a partnership to buy radio stations and 
receiving 1 million for his memoirs 
carter was defeated after his one term by reagan he moved back 
to plains ga but not as a peanut farmer instead he took up 
woodworking traveling meeting with world leaders climbing mount 
kilimanjaro becoming a visiting professor at emory university and 
devoting time to the carter presidential center where he hosts 
international conferences 
walter mondales disappearance from the spotlight has been so 
complete that democrats rarely mention the man who lost to reagan in 
a 1984 landslide 
oh i miss it a little mondale said in atlanta during the 
democratic national convention last summer but added you know i 
had my say and i dont miss the 18hour days 
mondale practices law in washington and minneapolis and theres 
been some talk not from him that he may try to reclaim his 
senate seat from minnesota in 1990 
barry goldwater defeated by lyndon johnson in 1964 cooled his 
political heels for four years then was reelected to the senate 
without the seniority he had built up in the previous two terms 
hubert humphrey who had been vice president for four years when 
he lost to nixon in 1968 spent a little while as a professor at 
macalester college and the university of minnesota then won back 
his senate seat in 1970 he ran again for the democratic nomination 
in 1972 but withdrew in the face of overwhelming odds at the partys 
convention he died of cancer in 1978 
mcgovern the south dakota senator who won the 1972 nomination 
but lost to nixon stayed in the senate until 1980 when he lost his 
seat he made a third try for the presidency in 1984 in a primary 
campaign that lasted less than six months before he dropped out 
the other presidential losers took their lumps and started anew 
after his second consecutive defeat for president in 1948 dewey 
saidi have been graduated at a comparatively early age to the 
role of elder statesman which someone has aptly defined as a 
politician who is no longer a candidate for any office 
a year later he wrote a friend nothing could arise now or in 
the future that would lead me to be the nominee of our party in 
1952 my decision on this matter is as certain and final as death 
and the staggering new deal taxes 
after more such disclaimers he ran in 1950 for his third term as 
governor of new york and won dewey died in 1971 
stevenson the eloquent but reluctant democratic candidate in 
1952 and 1956 was appointed by president kennedy to be us 
ambassador to the united nations a post he held until his death in 
1965 
when he lost the second time stevenson recalled the lincoln line 
that he felt like a little boy who had stubbed his toe in the dark 
too old to cry but it hurt too much to laugh

crying let me stay with my 
mommy please 12yearold ximena vicario was wrested from the 
woman who took her in as an infant knowing that the girls real 
mother was likely killed by security forces 
the wrenching scene tuesday replayed on afternoon and evening 
television newscasts dredged up bitter memories of the eightyear 
military dictatorship that ended in 1983 
during those years at least 8960 argentines were arrested and 
presumed killed as part of a brutal crackdown on leftist subversion 
ximenas parents juan carlos vicario and stella maris gallichio 
de vicario were arrested in february 1977 and never seen again 
they disappeared as argentines say 
then about eight months old ximena was handed over to a state 
orphanage where susana siciliano worked an identity tag stated the 
babys name and said she was the daughter of a subversive 
according to court records 
ms siciliano took the baby home and renamed her romina paola in 
1981 she legally adopted the child 
three years later darwinia rosa monaco de gallichio found out 
what had happened to her granddaughter and began legal proceedings 
to get her back 
she was supported in her efforts by the human rights group 
grandmothers of the plaza de mayo which estimates that about 300 
babies were born in or taken along with their mothers to clandestine 
detention centers and put up for adoption after the mothers were 
killed 
the group has helped reunite about 50 children with their 
biological families 
a federal appeals court ruled recently that ms siciliano must 
give up the child police took her and ximena to court tuesday 
where federal judge juan fegoli gave the girl to her grandmother 
after more than seven hours of talks with both sides and with 
psychologists 
they took away my daughter ms siciliano cried as she walked 
out of fegolis office 
ximena darkhaired and tearyeyed told reporters i dont 
want them to take me from my home or put me on a program of visits 
wtih obligatory hours and dates like the children of separated 
parents have 
im content to have another grandmother i want my 
grandmother to come and see me every time she wants but at the 
house of ms siciliano she said im going to escape if they take 
me away 
mrs gallichio lives in rosario 190 miles from buenos aires 
ms siciliano knew ximenas background from the start and hid 
those facts when she applied for adoption court records show ms 
siciliano who had said ximena had been abandoned by her maid faces 
charges of abduction of a minor and falsification of records 
an attorney for ms siciliano said she will appeal ximenas 
custody to the supreme court 
ximenas case reminded many of el caso juliana or the 
juliana case that in its own way tightened heartstrings across 
this south american country several months ago 
juliana trevino 10 at first was ordered taken from her adoptive 
parents and then returned jose and carmen trevino never hid the 
childs background suspected she might have been the daughter of a 
disappeared couple adopted her legally and worked with human 
rights groups to establish her identity 
ximenas case is much more typical and calls to mind the 1986 
oscarwinning movie the official story in which an argentine 
family adopts the daughter of a couple executed by police

president reagan will undergo surgery in 
washington saturday for a longstanding and worsening condition that 
causes the ring finger of his left hand to bend inward and resist 
straightening 
the president will enter walter reed army hospital on friday and 
is expected to return to the white house on sunday dr john hutton 
the white house physician announced tuesday 
hutton said the president will be operated on for a disease known 
as dupuytrens contracture 
this procedure should not interrupt his normal schedule other 
than the obvious presence of a dressing on the left hand the 
doctor said 
the presidents contracture was minimal but present when he 
took office in 1981 and has been followed over the past eight 
years he said within the past year it has progressed to the 
degree that surgical therapy is now necessary 
he said the surgery is expected to take two to three hours the 
presidents arm will be put to sleep but no general anaesthetic is 
planned he said 
dr charles lane a hand specialist in private practice in 
beverly hills said the cause of dupuytrens contracture is not 
known 
the disease is named for a french surgeon and anatomist who 
described it in 1833 
it strikes men more often than women but as many as one in every 
five people over age 60 are likely to be afflicted with it 
according to information provided by the hand surgery section of the 
orthopedic department at walter reed reagan is 77 
it pulls the finger down so the finger cant be straightened 
lane said so the finger gets in the way particularly for such 
things which might be a problem for mr reagan as shaking 
hands 
also its hard when you shave and try to get your hand in your 
pockets he said 
the curving of the fingers is caused by thickening of the gristle 
below the skin lane said 
he said the operation although delicate is not particularly 
risky 
the president and first lady are to fly to the white house on 
thursday after two weeks of relaxing at their new bel air home in 
los angeles and visiting friends in palm springs 
it will be reagans first surgery since he had an operation for 
an enlarged prostate in january 1987 he also underwent surgery in 
july 1985 for cancer of the colon and has been operated on for skin 
cancer 
in the past reagan has gone to bethesda naval hospital in the 
maryland suburbs just outside washington 
deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk said walter 
reed was chosen because the doctors who would do the operation were 
located there 
hutton said the physicians involved would be dr george bogumill 
of george town university a consultant at walter reed col alan 
smith and maj paul perlik of the hand service at walter reed and 
himself 
the anesthesiologist will be lt col charles gandy lt col 
lawrence mohr of the white house medical unit and members of the 
department of medicine at walter reed will take part as consultants 
the procedure is scheduled to begin at 730 am est hutton said 
the president is expected to be walking around by afternoon

president reagan says his new 
whistleblower bill will protect federal employes from reprisals 
for reporting wrongdoing and at he same time prevent undue 
harassment of agency heads about legitimate personnel decisions 
a democratic sponsor of similar legislation which the president 
vetoed in october however says reagans version is insufficient 
and probably irrelevant because george bush will be president on 
jan 20 
reagans proposal is nearly identical to current law rep 
patricia schroeder dcolo said in a telephone interview 
i dont think theres anybody except the president who thinks 
thats adequate she said the quacking duck has laid an egg 
an aide to rep frank horton rny who cosponsored last 
years bill with schroeder said the lawmaker had not seen reagans 
legislation but was pleased that it had been proposed 
i think its important the congress thinks its important and 
i hope we can all sit down and get a bill that can become law 
aide donald upson quoted horton as saying 
schroeder and horton reintroduced the vetoed version of the bill 
on tuesday the first day of the congressional session 
in vetoing the original bill reagan said it would have 
redesigned the whistleblower protection process so that employees 
who are not genuine whistleblowers could manipulate the process to 
their advantage simply to delay or avoid appropriate adverse 
personnel actions 
in a message to congress accompanying the new bill he said 
the legislation protects from reprisal federal employees who 
expose wrongdoing within the government it also ensures that 
federal personnel managers are not burdened with routinely defending 
appropriate personnel decisions 
federal employees who blow the whistle on fraud waste abuse 
and violations of the law help to ensure that the federal government 
uses american taxpayers dollars effectively and efficiently he 
said the nations laws must encourage such reports and protect 
those who make them from reprisal 
the vetoed bill would have required federal employes only to show 
that whistleblowing was a factor in their discharge or 
reassignment rather than a significant or dominant factor 
in order to prove they were discriminated against 
reagan said his bill would give federal employees the right to 
initiate a proceeding before the merit systems protection board to 
contest any action they considered a reprisal for whistleblowing 
it also would give preference to whistleblowers who seek 
transfers to other jobs comparable to the ones they hold 
it calls for an office of special counsel to protect federal 
employees by seeking orders from the merit systems protection board 
to set aside actions taken against employees until the employees 
case has been heard 
employees would have the right to seek review by a federal court 
if they do not win their case before the board 
unlike the earlier bill however it does not call for the 
special counsel to go to court to seek review of disputes to which 
his office is a party reagan said this was an infringement of the 
presidents constitutional power to settle differences within the 
executive branch of government

federal prosecutors unleashed a tough new law 
in their war on drugdealing street thugs hoping to send a repeat 
drug offender accused of possessing 150 grams of crack to prison 
with no chance of getting out 
richard van winrow a 21yearold reputed gang member pleaded 
innocent tuesday to three drugrelated charges at his arraignment 
before us district judge consuelo marshall 
the new law is being used to target gang members in the hopes 
of reducing drug sales and consumption said the prosecutor 
special assistant us attorney lisa lench theres a hope there 
will be an impact on the streetgang drug problem 
the charges against winrow are believed to be the first filed 
under the antidrug law president reagan signed in november ms 
lench said the law requires federal judges to impose life sentences 
with no hope of parole on defendants convicted of drug trafficking 
under certain circumstances 
in winrows case the circumstances are that he has at least two 
convictions on felony drugrelated charges and was holding at least 
50 grams of crack cocaine when he was arrested the prosecutor said 
winrows lawyer deputy public defender kevin brehm said the law 
is too harsh he said it is unfair that someone with three 
convictions for possessing cocaine as winrow has faces the same 
sentence as someone convicted at least twice previously of drug 
trafficking 
others who can be sentenced under the law include defendants with 
at least two felony drug convictions who are then convicted in 
federal court of possessing for sale at least 1 kilogram of heroin 
5 kilos of cocaine powder or 100 kilos of marijuana a kilogram 
equals 22 pounds 
this prosecution and future prosecutions are designed to 
convince the drug dealers on the streets that we are not kidding and 
they are not going to slip out of it said john gordon head of 
the gang drugtrafficking task force in the us attorneys office 
here 
winrow is charged with one count of possession with the intent to 
distribute cocaine one count of carrying and using a firearm in 
relation to the first charge and one count of possessing a firearm 
as an exconvict 
a march 7 trial date was set for the los angeles man who 
remained in custody without bail 
winrow was convicted three times in 1987 for possession of 
cocaine and was sentenced in state court to three years probation 
and 180 days in jail said ms lench a justice department 
prosecutor assigned to a joint federal state and local street gang 
task force in los angeles 
the task force was formed last year to combat the los angeles 
areas gang and drug problem last year more than 330 people in los 
angeles county were slain in gangrelated violence which 
authorities contend is often linked to the drug trade 
winrow was arrested on dec 8 for investigation of possessing 
about 150 grams of crack the potent smokable highly addictive 
form of cocaine with the intent to distribute it ms lench said 
brehm said he may challenge the constitutionality of the new 
federal law if winrow is convicted he also said he would 
investigate whether winrow was being prosecuted selectively 
but ms lench said winrow was not singled out unfairly he 
happens to be the first who meets the criteria

amnesty international today condemned turkey for 
its appalling human rights records saying it has received 
almost daily reports since november of political prisoners being 
tortured 
the londonbased rights organization says in a report released 
today that the turkish government has begun a public relations 
campaign to improve its image abroad but has taken no substantial 
steps to end the torturing of political detainees 
amnesty said 250000 political prisoners have been detained in 
turkey this decade and almost all of them were tortured 
thousands were imprisoned for nonviolent political or religious 
activities 60000 were convicted after unfair trails more than 700 
death sentences were imposed and at least 200 prisoners died in 
custody many alleged to be the result of torture the organization 
said 
amnesty said it sent urgent appeals to the turkish government in 
november and december but it said turkey has made no apparent 
effort to change the brutal reality of torture deaths in custody 
political imprisonment and unfair trials 
the group said that six months ago it gave turkish authorities 
the names of 229 men and women who had died in custody in the 
preceding 7 years but the authorities have provided no 
explanation whatsoever for 144 of the deaths 
the report says most reported cases of torture and deaths in 
custody occur within the initial period of detention when detainees 
are held incommunicado and interrogated 
it says the prisoners are tortured to obtain confessions and 
as a form of pretrial punishment 
the most frequently used methods are beatings with fists feet 
truncheons or other tools on any part of the body the systematic 
beating of the soles of the feet or falaka is the traditional 
method the report says 
among specific cases described by amnesty is that of sadik 
celebi who was detained nov 16 authorities provided no 
information about his whereabouts until nov 26 when they delivered 
his body to his family the report says 
officials said celebi died in an armed encounter with guerrilla 
forces but relatives said his body was covered with bruises in 
addition to the bullet wounds the report says 
amnesty quoted a mardin state hospital official as saying celebi 
had been dead since at least nov 22 the day before the guerrilla 
encounter alleged by the authorities 
it also cited hasan hakki erdogan who died in police custody in 
istanbul in 1984 police said he died of kidney and heart failure 
amnesty said it was only after five police officers were convicted 
last month of torturing the prisoner that authorities acknowledged 
he had been tortured 
turkey ratified the european convention for the prevention of 
torture in february and the un convention against torture in 
august 
despite these positive moves and repeated claims that human 
rights are respected in turkey the authorities appear reluctant to 
take even the most elementary practical steps to eradicate human 
rights abuses and have failed to implement the provisions of the 
treaties amnesty said 
an amnesty international delegation discussed human rights with 
government officials in turkey in june in august the organization 
sent the government a memorandum on its concerns and recommendations 
for preventing further abuses in november it published a report on 
its concerns 
turkey has not responded to the recommendations in the memorandum 
or the report amnesty said 
instead it has conducted a worldwide public relations campaign 
and turkish embassies in several countries have provided amnesty 
international with largely incomplete and unsatisfactory 
explanations for a range of human rights abuses

12398 yen today and closed at 12405 yen down 185 yen from last

the us currencys plunge resulted from massive dollarselling 
after excessive dollarbuying toward the end of last year following 
similar trends on overseas markets said a dealer with the bank of 
tokyo speaking on condition of anonymity 
trading today was directionless mainly because it was lacking 
marketaffecting news he said adding that the rate stabilized at 
around the 124yen level today 
the majority of speculative investors remained on the sidelines 
to await us unemployment figures for december due to be announced 
friday he added

extinguished by a duke power co fire brigade the unusual event 
posed no danger to plant workers or to the public spokeswoman mary 
boyd said 
workers were bringing unit 1 online when an electrical breaker 
associated with the reactors coolant pumps apparently caught fire 
station manager mike tuckman said 
the unit had been automatically shut down monday by what is known 
as a reactor trip which he said occurs several times a year 
when the fire occurred operators manually took the unit offline 
and deenergized the four reactor coolant pumps which under 
normal conditions are used to carry heat away from the hot reactor 
core 
tuckman said natural circulation of cooling water continued in 
the reactor until one pump was restarted about 2 hours after the 
fire was put out there was never any danger of core overheating he 
said 
the unusual event the leastserious of four emergency 
nuclear plant classifications began at 745 pm but tuckman said 
the situation remained stable 
nuclear regulatory commission inspectors were at the plant 
tuesday night monitoring the situation tuckman said 
ms boyd said workers would have to inspect the damage to 
electric equipment before company officials can estimate when the 
unit will go back into operation units 2 and 3 at oconee continued 
normal operation

gov michael dukakis says his decision to forgo a 
chance for a record fourth term has nothing to do with his prospects 
in national politics but admitted its exceedingly difficult to 
run for president as governor 
with two years remaining in his term dukakis unexpectedly 
announced tuesday he would not seek reelection in 1990 he parried 
questions about his political future however saying only he 
intended to be active in national affairs and would not rule out 
another run for the white house 
public policy and public service is what im all about its 
what i love dukakis 55 told a crowded news conferenceive 
loved this office and i still do 
the defeated democratic presidential candidate said his decision 
not to seek an unprecedented fourth term as massachusetts governor 
was not related to the 1988 presidential campaign or to a possible 
1992 rematch against presidentelect bush 
he acknowledged however that it was exceedingly difficult 
to mount a national political campaign while exercising executive 
authority and defending his long record as governor 
i think the deliberate distortions about massachusetts were 
increasingly difficult to defend said dukakis whose initially 
strong campaign withered under republican attacks on his 
gubernatorial record on crime the environment and other issues 
franklin d roosevelt was the last sitting governor to win the 
white house in 1932 
when asked whether he intends to run for president in 1992 
dukakis said ive learned occasionally painfully never to say 
never in politics 
however the governor who has ruled out a run for congress said 
it was much too early to discuss 1992 
political analyst william schneider of the american enterprise 
institute a democratic think tank in washington said dukakis 
decision was consistent with another run for the presidency 
but it is regarded with some dismay among democrats because 
the conventional wisdom is that he was a poor candidate who ran a 
poor campaign schneider said hes got to change that 
perception to let people know that he has changed that he learned 
something 
elaine kamarck a democratic party activist in new york city 
said dukakis made a smart move if he intends to run for president 
again adding now im not sure thats what this means 
she also said there is an undercurrent of anger within the 
party 
there is some feeling this could have been a democratic year 
and he blew it she said if he runs again i dont know how he 
copes with that 
dukakis aides were divided over the likelihood that he would seek 
the white house again 
i have heard nothing that michael dukakis has said publicly or 
privately even oneonone that would bow in that direction said 
s stephen rosenfeld a presidential campaign aide who now serves as 
dukakis chief of staff 
but paul pezzella who worked with rosenfeld on the campaign and 
now serves as his deputy said i think hed like another whack at 
it 
the announcement broke a political logjam in massachusetts 
politics and touched off immediate speculation about the new 
landscape in the democratic party here and in washington 
in recent weeks dukakis had been urged by democrats to announce 
his intentions so they could begin making plans it seemed to me 
desirable to make the decision now rather than later dukakis 
said 
among democrats expected to consider a run for governor are 
boston mayor raymond l flynn former state attorney general francis 
x bellotti and us rep joseph p kennedy ii along with 
conservative state rep john flood 
if he completes his current term dukakis would surpass 
revolutionary war patriot john hancock as the longestserving 
governor in massachusetts history hancock held the office for 11 
years

conductor phillipe entremont says hes resigning 
from the denver symphony because budget cuts made his vision of the 
orchestras future like a bird being shot in midair 
entremont has been principal conductor of the dso since 1986 and 
music director since 1987 he said tuesday his resignation from the 
posts is effective in june the end of the season 
entremont 54 also is a concert pianist and conductor of the 
vienna chamber orchestra and director of the orchestra colonne de 
paris 
he said he believed the dso was progressing at a wonderful 
rate toward the artistic goals he had set but plans to trim its 
schedule because of cuts to the artistic budget threaten to bring 
the orchestra 10 years back 
with the division of opinion between myself and the board 
regarding the orchestras musical goals i had no other choice but 
to resign he said i never cheat artistic matters 
the dso has struggled financially in recent seasons and in 
september the symphony board announced it would seek protection 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code a panel appointed 
by mayor federico pena studied the situation and recommended a 
budget for next season of 65 million 800000 less than the 
198889 budget 
entremont said he had seen no encouraging signs in the last few 
months that the board saw the orchestra as a major international 
orchestra 
he also criticized state government for giving insufficient 
support to the arts 
this orchestra i think deserves much better than it got its 
really a firstclass orchestra he said it was like a bird 
being shot in midair 
dso president chris dunworth said the board accepted entremonts 
resignation with regret and planned to meet today to initiate a 
search for his successor

the captain of a ferry that sank 
on new years day with the loss of 79 lives claims the crew of the 
naval patrol boat that was towing his boat was drunk 
the mishap off the caribbean coast was guatemalas worst maritime 
disaster 
late tuesday the captain of the ferry who is charged with 
negligent homocide in the case blamed the navy crew for the 
accident during an interview in a national police jail in this city 
the captain juan pablo esquivel said those on the navy ship 
which he said included nonnavy personnel were celebrating on 
deck during the towing operation he said he smelled alcohol on 
the breath of a machinist who boarded his packed ferry from the navy 
vessel to check the motor 
the ferry skipper said that after eight minutes of towing the 
navy vessel made a brusque acceleration that caused the ferry to 
flip over 
capt rigoberto kiste of the puerto barrios naval base said by 
telephone that he could not officially respond to the charges 
because the navys investigation was continuing 
but earlier tuesday another officer at the local naval base 
denied that the patrol vessel no 654 was at fault and said the 
ferry captain must shoulder prime responsibility 
a tugboat captain and other witnesses told the associated press 
that the ferry was towed with too short a cable and that the patrol 
boat did not slow down even after the ferry started listing 
the wake of the patrol boat was hitting hard against our bow 
and our bow was down in the water you cant keep a ship under 
control when its bow is down in the water said ladislao ponce 
47 who has worked for 19 years as a tugboat captain and who was a 
passenger on the ferry 
capt anibal giron second in command at puerto barrios naval 
base and a graduate of the us coast guard academy remarked 
when people are in grief when theyve suffered loss they look to 
affix blame immediately our business is saving lives we are as 
upset about this as anyone 
giron said the navy was investigating but the preliminary 
conclusion is that esquivel the ferry captain was mainly to blame 
ponce was traveling with his wife and two daughters sunday when 
the ferry justo rufino barrios ii flipped and sank in amatique bay 
while making the 16mile run from livingston to puerto barrios 
ponces wife and one daughter drowned 
ponce said the ferry lost power either from lack of fuel or 
engine trouble and drifted an hour until a naval patrol boat arrived 
and offered a tow 
the cable they used to tow us was very short about 15 meters 
49 feet long said ponce he and rodolfo lucano another 
commercial captain said the cable should have been at least 165 
feet long 
the vessel listed sharply twice to port then starboard but 
they did not reduce speed they must have seen that we were listing 
dangerously said ponce he said passengers were panicked by the 
second steep tilt 
the vessel flipped over trapping passengers below 
rogelio franzua an 18yearold high school student who had been 
headed home to puerto barrios also estimated the length of the 
towing cable at 45 feet he like ponce said no life jackets were 
aboard the rufino barrios 
both the ferry and the navy have responsibility because the 
ferry was overloaded and without needed equipment and the patrol 
boat should have taken off at least some of us before beginning to 
tow and they towed us too fast franzua said

japanese companies captured half the 
worlds 502 billion semiconductor market last year while the 
market share of us companies declined according to a survey 
released today 
the american share fell from 39 percent in 1987 to 37 percent in 
1988 while the japanese share rose about the same amount from about 
48 percent to 50 percent according to the annual industry survey by 
dataquest a market research and consulting firm 
american companies are not taking advantage of highgrowth 
areas to the same extent said stan bruederle vice president for 
dataquests components division research 
japanese companies emphasis on the industrys fastestgrowing 
segments such as high performance microprocessors and particularly 
dynamic random access memory or drams was responsible for the 2 
percent change in both regions market share bruederle said 
the san josebased company which surveyed 112 top semiconductor 
suppliers also reported that worldwide growth in the industry 
slowed in the final three months of 1988 
global semiconductor sales in 1988 reached 502 billion up 329 
percent from 1987s 381 billion market that increase was greater 
than the industrys 228 percent growth in 1987 but less than 
dataquests growth forecast of 358 percent 
if you look at total worldwide revenues this is typical of 
what occurs at this stage of the business cycle bruederle said 
the semiconductor industry enjoyed its greatest growth in the decade 
in 1984 when sales jumped 48 percent he said 
dataquest said that japanese companies dominance in drams the 
highdensity lowcost memories widely used in personal computers 
helped boost their share of the american semiconductor market to a 
record 20 percent last year up from 15 percent in 1987 
but american companies also gained in the japanese market 
capturing 10 percent of sales in 1988 an increase of nearly 2 
percent from 1987 it was the first time us companies improved 
their share of the japanese market since 1984 dataquest said 
japanese semiconductor companies however have a builtin 
advantage of being the primary suppliers of the japanese market the 
fastestgrowing market in the world bruederle said japanese 
companies enjoy 89 percent of their domestic market 
european companies sales dropped to 10 percent last year from 11 
percent in 1987 but companies in other parts of the world enjoyed a 
greater market share 3 percent in 1988 compared with 16 percent 
the year before dataquest said

the arrival of a record 242000 
immigrants from eastern europe more than half from poland has 
strained west germans hospitality and ability to integrate so many 
newcomers 
the bavarian culture ministry meanwhile announced tuesday that 
a russianlanguage school will open next fall in pfarrkirchen to 
help assimilate refugee children from the soviet union 
those making up the largest group of immigrants in 1988 140226 
came from poland followed by 47572 soviets of german descent and 
39832 people from east germany 
the increase over the previous record of 90000 in 1987 reflects 
a relaxation of emigration policy in the three soviet bloc countries 
even more refugees are expected this year said horst 
waffenschmidt the interior ministry official responsible for 
refugees 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs reform efforts have eased 
restrictions on those seeking to leave the country and the more 
tolerant view has been adopted to some degree by authorities in 
warsaw and east berlin 
politicians and labor union officials concerned about west 
germanys 8 percent jobless rate have been increasingly critical of 
the governments policy of accepting virtually all ethnic germans 
seeking to emigrate to the west 
many of the newcomers speak little or no german and are already 
near retirement age or have limited job skills 
the east european refugees usually require governmentfinanced 
housing food language training and other social services for 
months after their arrival 
saarland state governor oskar lafontaine of the leftwing social 
democratic party complained in october that the ethnic germans were 
getting priority over people from third world countries seeking 
political asylum 
waffenschmidt an influential member of chancellor helmut kohls 
christian democrat party said the bonn government is committed to 
doing all it can to ease for these countrymen their new start in 
our land 
he said 11 billion has been earmarked for aiding east european 
refugees in 1989 
christian democratic spokesman johannes gester on tuesday urged 
the government to create a fourth reception camp for soviet bloc 
immigrants to ease crowding at the three facilities currently 
registering arrivals and provide initial assistance for them 
thousands of immigrants are camped in crowded barracks and tent 
cities throughout the federal republic local governments struggle 
with short funds and a tight housing market to provide suitable 
dwellings 
emigration to west germany from romania fell by about 1000 last 
year to 12902 according to the interior ministry figures there 
were 959 resettlers from czechoslovakia 763 from hungary and 223 
from yugoslavia the government reported

the union movement and dealing with trying to revive polands 
limping economy

joel steinbergs attorney says he doesnt expect 
his client will be acquitted in his trial in which he is accused of 
fatally beat his illegally adopted 6yearold daughter 
i think the best we can get is criminally negligent homicide 
lead defense attorney ira london said in an interview in todays new 
york newsday 
i know joel wont like that because he wants nothing short of 
acquittal but i dont think its realistic london said tuesday 
hell probably do jail time 
also tuesday judge harold rothwax ruled that steinberg must 
undergo an examination by a psychiatrist selected by prosecutors 
because steinbergs lawyers seemed to be presenting an insanity 
defense without formally declaring so 
steinberg 47 is accused of seconddegree murder in the november 
1987 beating death of lisa steinberg 
steinberg must decide whether to argue that he is not criminally 
responsible by reason of mental disease or defect if a defendant 
makes such a claim the prosecution can examine him 
london said he probably will not argue insanity and probably will 
refuse to allow prosecution psychiatrists to examine steinberg he 
said the judge misunderstood the defense position 
i dont think were going to argue mental disease or defect 
london said but the problem is the judge interprets what were 
going to argue as mental disease or defect 
london said he will not argue that steinberg was insane 
i dont think he was crazy i think what happened here is that 
he did not have a perception of what lisa was suffering he said 
he said steinberg got bad information or no information from his 
thenlivein lover hedda nussbaum about the childs condition 
rothwax told prosecutors to have the petition for him to sign 
thursday he left it to both sides to work out an examination 
schedule 
if the defense doesnt invoke an insanity defense the 
prosecution psychiatrist wont be called the judge said if the 
defense clearly does present an insanity defense then the 
prosecution will be prepared to rebut the testimony he said 
last month rothwax turned down a defense request to present an 
insanity defense saying they had to present psychiatric evidence to 
support the request the defense then abandoned that approach 
london said such a move would have required the defendant to give 
up his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination and would 
permit the psychiatrist to testify about any unproven comment he had 
heard about steinberg 
assistant district attorneys peter casolaro and john mccusker 
charged last week that steinbergs lawyers were presenting an 
insanity defense by using the testimony of lay witnesses 
in the newsday interview london said he took the case because it 
was a challenge 
i have three daughters of my own and they were very upset when 
i decided to take this case london said steinberg approached 
me i never thought it was going to be as intense as it was though 
but of course there was also a nice fee involved 
london declined to reveal the amount but newsday quoted an 
unidentified court source as saying it was around 500000 
at the time of his arrest steinberg reportedly had 2 million in 
assets half of which was later taken by the internal revenue 
service in back taxes the newspaper said 
but after awhile even my family came to understand this was 
about more than a large fee london said they understand now 
that if joel steinberg can get a fair trial in this country anyone 
can joel steinberg deserves his day in court like everyone else

chinese students in a central city beat a sri 
lankan student threw rocks at africans and put up antiblack 
posters as racial tensions spread to a fourth chinese city 
foreigners said today 
the violence occurred saturday at the central china polytechnical 
college in wuhan 680 miles south of beijing said a student from 
gabon and an american teacher 
in beijing meanwhile african students boycotted classes at the 
beijing languages institute today one day after chinese 
demonstrated against an alleged attack by a black student on a 
chinese woman 
brothers let us unite and fight for dignity said a leaflet 
distributed by africans at the institute black is beauty 
in wuhan chinese students put up posters saying black devil 
go home on the walls of the foreign dormitory at the college 
according to a student from gabon 
he also quoted a sri lankan student as saying he had been 
attacked and beaten by chinese the gabonese said he did not think 
the sri lankan had been seriously injured 
about 300 chinese students also roamed the campus on saturday 
throwing rocks at the african students dormitory said the 
gabonese who was at the college visiting friends when the attack 
occurred 
school authorities responded sunday by suddenly taking the 
colleges 12 african students on a trip to the interior of hubei 
province where wuhan is located said the gabonese a student from 
hubei medical college 
as of today he said the students had yet to return 
other schools responded by canceling african parties and urging 
darkskinned students not to leave campus said the gabonese and an 
american teacher 
the incident in wuhan began tuesday when chinese students from 
the polytechnical institute wrote a letter to the schools director 
saying they didnt want africans in their university because african 
were polluting chinese society with their relations with chinese 
women the student said 
he said he learned about the contents of the letter from a 
chinese official at the college who is responsible for the africans 
the letter also expressed support for antiblack demonstrations 
occurring simultaneously in nanking several hundred miles to the 
east 
last week thousands of chinese youths demonstrated in nanking 
following a clash between african students and chinese at hehai 
university over chinese women 
chinese authorities say the brawl occurred when two african 
students hit a gatekeeper who refused to allow two chinese women to 
attend an african christmas eve party official chinese news reports 
have said 11 africans and two chinese were injured 
during the demonstrations chinese youths yelled racist slogans 
and called for the africans to be punished 
chinese authorities later arrested one african student from 
ghana and detained three others for questioning in a move 
apparently aimed at quelling the demonstrators wrath 
on tuesday su xiaoxun an official in nanking denied 
allegations made by african students and diplomats that chinese 
forces on saturday attacked and tortured africans at a guest house 
about 50 miles outside nanking 
african students and a diplomat from benin claimed chinese troops 
had applied electic shocks to african students faces backs and 
genitals 
the 140 mostly african students had been forced to the guest 
house on dec 26 following the africanchinese clash and the 
protests 
in beijing about 500 african students at the beijing languages 
institute began their class boycott today as about 2000 chinese 
ended theirs 
the day before about 200 chinese marched for two hours 
protesting the incident during which an african student allegedly 
followed a chinese woman into her room at 430 am on new years 
day 
african students said they were boycotting classes because the 
chinese treat them like animals according to the leaflet 
if we keep silent against this discrimination we witness then 
we are animals and are guilty the leaflet said 
relations between chinese and africans are tense chinese are 
often openly racist and africans are frustrated by a culture that is 
very different than their own the tensions become explosive when 
chinese women are involved 
chinese students are also unhappy with the way the government and 
their schools are treating them and have jumped on the african issue 
as a pretext to vent complex feelings of discontent about their 
position in society 
a fourth raciallyrelated incident continued in hangzhou where 
56 african students have been boycotting classes for a week because 
they allege chinese authorities say they all have aids

at least 10 countries are reliably 
reported to have chemical weapons and several have unleashed them 
in recent wars swedish researchers say 
but an accurate and certain count of countries posssessing 
chemical weapons is clouded by disinformation and vested interests 
said the stockholm international peace research institute 
at one time or another 38 countries were reported to have 
chemical weapons but the reports often were unreliable or hard to 
assess sipri said in its 1988 yearbook which was published in 
august 
its hard to put a figure on it sipri researcher johan 
lundin said in an interview today a few countries have declared 
they have chemical weapons others say they intend to have them and 
there are a lot of allegations against other countries we have no 
information of our own 
sipri is a private research institute partially funded by the 
swedish government it was established to monitor the world arms 
trade and developments in disarmament mainly through published 
reports 
sipri said in the 1988 yearbook that responsible us and other 
government officials speaking on the record listed nine countries as 
having chemical weapons or intending to acquire them 
these were france iraq north korea syria the united states 
the soviet union afghanistan iran and vietnam 
since the books publication the united states has accused libya 
of having a weaponsproducing capability libya denies it 
lundin said the us allegation about libyas capability was as 
reliable as those on which the previous count of nine nations was 
based 
sipri said other countries have been named in less reliable 
reports a purported 1983 us intelligence document leaked to the 
british broadcasting corp added the names of burma china egypt 
ethiopia israel libya and taiwan as possessors 
last year iran and iraq were reported to have used toxic gases 
combatants in angola mozambique and afghanistan also made 
unsubstantiated allegations that they were victims of chemical 
warfare lundin said 
in 1987 libya was accused of using lethal gas in chad and 
vietnam was charged with poisoning water supplies in cambodia and 
the sipri yearbook said chemical weapons were used in the iraniraq 
war 
the previous year charges of chemical war were raised against 
ethiopia iraq iran the soviet union vietnam angola chad libya 
and nicaragua sipri reported without elaborating

anheuserbusch cos says it has suspended 
production at its biggest brewery because an oil slick working its 
way down the mississippi river has slightly altered the taste of the 
water used in making beer 
our quality control systems are highly sensitive to changes in 
the content and aroma of the city drinking water used in the brewing 
process andrew j steinhubl senior vice president of brewing 
said tuesday 
and we acted immediately to cease production when we detected a 
change 
company officials had not detected anything that would indicate a 
health hazard steinhubl said the company said the shutdown will 
last several days at most and will not affect the availability of 
the companys products 
the shutdown forced the layoff of about 2000 brewing and 
packaging production employees steinhubl said about 4000 other 
employees including maintenance workers and office staff will 
remain on the job he said 
the oil slick resulted from the rupture dec 24 of a shell oil 
co pipeline in central missouri state officials said the spill was 
the worst in missouri history 
hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude oil spilled into the 
gasconade river a tributary of the missouri river which flows into 
the mississippi above st louis 
by dec 28 the oil had reached the missouri and mississippi 
river intakes of the st louis water departments plants it now has 
reached as far south on the mississippi as cape girardeau 110 miles 
southeast of here officials said 
james shea st louis director of public utilities stressed that 
the water was safe to drink but that residents might notice a slight 
oily taste or smell 
city officials said the oiltainted water is just now reaching 
customers because the city filled its reserve tanks last week in 
anticipation of the slick 
shell has recovered about 336000 gallons of the oil from the 
rivers and its cleanup is expected to continue at least through 
next week 
anheuserbusch has 11 other breweries the st louis brewery is 
the companys oldest and largest producing 13 million barrels of 
beer a year or 35000 barrels a day

a federal appeals court rejected as 
unconstitutional a school systems practice of offering 
nonsectarian invocations before football games 
a panel of the 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled 21 
tuesday that the offering of prayers by laymen is still 
objectionable because the practice has a religious purpose and a 
primary effect of advancing religion 
im ecstatic said douglas jager 20 the former douglas 
county high school student who sued the 13800student douglas 
county school system in suburban atlanta in 1985 this is exactly 
where i wanted it to be 
at the time invocations were delivered by ministers jager who 
described himself as an agnostic said the prayers violated 
separation of church and state 
in the meantime the school district opened up the invocations to 
nonministers jager and his father challenged the equal access 
plan as well 
a federal judge threw out the original plan but said the 
alternative was acceptable 
however the appeals court said tuesday there is no indication 
that the school district will refrain from its 40yearold practice 
of having clergy deliver religious invocations before high school 
football games 
jeffrey bramlett the jagers attorney said the decision should 
provide guidance for other school systems that allow pregame 
prayers 
hopefully they will see the handwriting on the wall and will 
recognize what they need to do to comply with the law he said 
school superintendent jim steele said he had not seen the ruling 
and could not comment

a daughter haunted by nightmares about her 
mothers 1985 disappearance pried open a locked basement freezer and 
found the womans battered body prompting her fathers confession 
to the slaying police say 
leonard tyburski who told police he kept the body in the freezer 
for 3 years because he loved his wife and didnt want to part with 
her was charged with murder authorities said 
it has some indications of edgar allan poe and even some alfred 
hitchcock said district judge james garber who arraigned 
tyburski on tuesday and ordered him held without bond in the wayne 
county jail 
garber delayed scheduling a preliminary hearing until tyburski 
45 underwent psychiatric tests to determine whether he was 
competent to stand trial 
tyburski dean of students at detroits mackenzie high school 
had cooperated with police investigating his wifes disappearance 
dorothy tyburski was 37 when he reported her missing on oct 2 
1985 tyburski passed a liedetector test and hadnt been considered 
a suspect police said 
the case treated as a missing person report had been closed for 
two years 
but disturbing dreams by one of the couples daughters led her to 
suspect her mothers body was somewhere in the house police said 
kelly tyburski a 20yearold art student at michigan state 
university had nightmares or dreams or whatever you want to call 
them that her mother was in a place where she couldnt move either 
tied up or locked up said police detective richard pomorski of 
canton township a middleclass community 25 miles west of detroit 
she didnt suspect her father until she remembered the freezer 
had been used before her mothers disappearance and the key to it 
had disappeared he said 
later detective keith lazar said the daughters dreams gave way 
to suspicions when tyburski began making up stories about why the 
key was missing 
on monday she pried the lock off the 15cubicfoot freezer while 
her father was away police said she found blood on the lid and 
sides and her mothers clothed body bent over meat wrapped in 
butcher paper police said 
kelly tyburski and her 16yearold sister kim called a friend 
who drove them to the police station ignoring their father as he 
returned home detectives said police obtained a warrant and 
arrested tyburski 
later tyburski told police he killed his wife during an argument 
on sept 28 1985 pomorski said 
it appeared he felt sorry for her pomorski said he kept 
her in the basement for 3 years his reason was that he loved her 
he didnt want to part with her 
tyburskis daughters appeared with him during his arraignment but 
did not speak with reporters 
the cause of death remained undetermined pending an autopsy 
lazar said 
the couple had been married 17 years when tyburski reported his 
wife missing police said tyburski told them his wife had left 
with the clothes on her back after an argument and that she told 
him in late october 1985 that she planned to settle in toledo ohio 
police had no reason to suspect foul play because people leave 
home all the time detective lt larry stewart said we did some 
relatively minor checking 
tyburski passed a lie detector test and later told police and 
neighbors his wife had moved to ohio and that she might have left 
because of emotional problems stemming from the death of a sister 
stewart said

fighting flared in south lebanon today 
after syrian troops moved into neighborhoods on the outskirts of 
beirut to separate rival shiite moslem factions who had battled for 
five days 
a police spokesman said 10 combatants were wounded in the mortar 
duels in iklim eltiffah shattering an overnight lull 
the new casualties increased the overall toll in the fiveday 
confrontation to 29 killed and 76 wounded 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
regulations said it was not known which of the two factions the 
proiranian hezbollah or the syrianbacked amal rekindled the 
confrontation just north of israels selfdesignated security zone 
in south lebanon 
the two factions have been fighting for control of villages 
bordering the northwestern edge of the security zone amal is 
entrenched in the market town of nabatiyeh and hezbollah holds 
positions in the nearby villages of jbaa ein bouswar jarjou arab 
saleem and louwaizeh 
in south beiruts slums the undeclared truce held but officials 
feared it would not last in the absence of a political settlement of 
the power struggle that has raged for nine months 
the shiite communitys mufti or religious judge said in a 
statement the only solution is to disarm the two militias 
their weapons have become tools for killing children and other 
innocent people sheik abdul amir qabalan said no one should be 
allowed to possess weapons in south beirut except the syrian 
forces 
the syrians who have had 4500 troops in south beirut since the 
first round of hezbollahamal fighting last year moved into the 
area at night 
soldiers wearing helmets and armed with ak47 automatic rifles 
and rocketpropelled grenade launchers quietly entered contested 
neighborhoods and tore down sandbag barricades the militiamen had 
erected when the latest battle began on new years eve the police 
spokesman said 
he said the syrian soldiers manned narrow buffer zones separating 
the combatants and syrian officers used loudspeakers to order 
militiamen to withdraw from the streets and remove military 
manifestations 
several sandbagged positions were removed before dawn several 
gunmen withdrew from the streets but they gathered at entrances to 
buildings or basements the police spokesman said 
he described the syrian move as another shot of tranquilizers 
the clashes will start again if the syrians do not crack down on 
one faction or the other he said the situation in south lebanon 
was more delicate because there are no syrian regulars in that 
area 
many civilians were seen leaving the south beirut slums for safer 
areas in the capital during the lull in fighting today 
they militias still have plenty of weapons and ammunition 
they will fight again said umm mohammed a resident of the south 
beirut neighborhood of haret hreik 
ill return to south beirut only when one of the two factions 
smashes the other or when the syrians disarm both groups she said 
at her daughters home in west beirut 
a syrian military source who demanded anonymity said the army 
will talk to both sides convince them of certain measures and 
deploy on the ground to implement these measures there is no 
decision to crack down on either side 
in addition to their contingent in south beirut the syrians have 
7500 troops in west beirut and 25000 soldiers in eastern and 
northern provinces under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the arab 
league

a tentative 97 million settlement reached 
with malibu residents whose expensive homes were damaged in a 1983 
landslide may halt what was expected to be one of the longest trials 
ever 
the settlement from the county the state and insurance companies 
was offered tuesday to about 250 homeowners who blamed the landslide 
on a decision to cut into a hillside to build a highway 
the homeowners will receive an average of about 200000 if the 
offer is approved said kenneth chiate one of the homeowners and an 
attorney in the case the rest of the settlement goes toward 
lawyers fees 
the vast majority of the homeowners wanted out he said 
its been a long five years no matter how much money we got 
theres no way it could pay for the damage some of them suffered 
the trial which was due to start next month was expected to 
last two to five years and run up nearly 100 million in legal fees 
not all the homeowners were happy with the settlement offer 
actor pernell roberts complained that it fails to punish the parties 
responsible for the landslide 
we will never have an opportunity to get at the real heart of 
the crime he said 
this was a tragic situation where many people will never come 
close to being fully compensated for their loss and the people 
responsible for what happened will continue to make bad judgments 
involving innocent people 
the homeowners claimed the slide caused 200 million in damage 
thirty homes were condemned many have moved several feet toward 
the ocean since the slide and owners have been unable to sell said 
attorney richard norton who represented some of the homeowners 
under the proposal the county will pay 35 million homeowners 
charged that the county helped cause the landslide by approving 
development on big rock mesa 
the state department of transportation will pay 15 million in 
addition to 25 million it agreed to pay earlier after being found 
liable for contributing to the landslide by cutting into the mesa to 
build pacific coast highway 
the homeowners insurance companies will pay 22 million under 
the proposal however some of those companies have not agreed to 
that amount chiate said 
the cases of 16 families not represented by chiate or norton 
remain unresolved 
under terms of the settlement the property owners would drop 
future claims and the county would be absolved of responsibility

red army soldiers who remain there could stay beyond the feb 15 
withdrawal deadline 
if a ceasefire holds and there is no fighting in afghanistan 
then thats a very good situation for soviet forces to leave 
deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov told reporters as he arrived 
in islamabad 
afghan insurgents headquartered in pakistan have refused to 
accept a ceasefire until the current moscowbacked government in 
kabul steps down 
asked whether soviet troops could overstay the deadline 
vorontsov said we shall see i dont know 
vorontsov who is also ambassador to afghanistan is searching 
for a political consensus that will enable the soviets to get all 
their troops out on schedule and without being attacked along the 
way 
shortly after arriving vorontsov met privately with pakistans 
foreign minister sahabzada yaqub khan the soviet official refused 
to discuss the substance of the talks but as he left the meeting he 
told the associated press the talks were very interesting and very 
useful 
when he was asked to elaborate he said we talked about 
sovietpakistan relations and afghanistan 
pakistans foreign secretary humayun khan told the ap following 
the meeting that both sides are trying to work toward a political 
solution 
pakistan along with the united states has strongly supported 
the afghan insurgents who began fighting after an april 1978 
communist coup 
about 100000 soviet troops intervened in afghanistan in december 
1979 to replace one promoscow regime with another under 
unmediated accords half the troops had left by aug 15 the 
balance are to be out by feb 15 
the soviets who say more than 13300 of their soldiers have been 
killed in the war have already begun withdrawing troops from the 
western afghan cities of shindand and herat western diplomats said 
tuesday 
they also said soviet civilian advisers are leaving kabul en 
masse and quoted afghan officials as saying the main red army exodus 
will begin jan 15 
vorontsov said today that no further talks have been scheduled 
with leaders of the pakistanbased guerrilla alliance with whom he 
met in saudi arabia last month in the kremlins first official 
recognition of the insurgents 
the guerrilla alliances chairman sibghatullah mojaddidi told a 
news conference tuesday that he expected to meet vorontsov on 
friday but guerrilla sources say some alliance members want no more 
meetings with the soviets 
the saudi arabia meeting was tacit acknowledgment from moscow 
that it is exploring a noncommunist alternative to president najib 
head of the embattled kabul government 
nevertheless vorontsov today refused to write off moscows 
allies in kabul as participants in a future afghan government 
the ruling marxists will survive by all means he said but 
they are willing to participate in the creation of a broadbased 
government 
the seven pakistanbased guerrilla groups in the alliance while 
divided on most things agree the najib regime can play no part in a 
postwar afghanistan 
insurgents claims that the kabul government will collapse 
without soviet help is a big mistake said vorontsov thats 
wishful thinking 
mojaddidi on tuesday announced a lastminute attempt to form a 
transitional government and said a 400member consultative council 
would convene within three weeks 
half its members would be drawn from guerrilla commanders 
fighting soviet and afghan government troops the rest would include 
wellknown intellectuals tribal leaders and good moslems 
but it will be difficult to select and convene such a council 
and the resistance movement has scant time to maneuver 
vorontsov was in tehran on tuesday meeting iranianbased leaders 
of shiite moslem afghan guerrillas who operate separately from and 
have occasionally been at odds with the seven sunni moslem groups 
based in the pakistani border city of peshawar that comprise the 
main guerrilla alliance 
at least 55 million afghans have fled their country during a 
decade of civil war most to pakistan the insurgents use border 
cities and refugee camps as bases and supply points for operations 
inside afghanistan

lowincome residents in san francisco alameda and contra costa 
counties 
in about 30 percent of the deliveries in the east bay there 
was some relationship to cocaine said loubet he said that while 
a normal delivery costs about 3000 a baby affected by cocaine can 
cost as much as 150000

a senior aide to plo chairman yasser 
arafat today accused the mossad israels secret service of bombing 
pan am flight 103 to counter growing international sympathy for the 
palestinian cause 
however salah khalaf admitted the plo did not have concrete 
evidence linking the disaster to israel 
khalaf cofounder of arafats fatah the mainstream palestine 
liberation organization faction also renewed a plo offer to help 
washingtons probe into the bombing that killed 270 people on dec 
21 
the boeing 747 with 259 people on board crashed into the town 
of lockerbie scotland all on board and 11 people on the ground 
died 
we charge mossad of carrying out the operation khalaf said 
at a news conference the sole party to benefit from this incident 
at this time in particular is israel because it is seeking to 
undercut the prominence that the palestinian issue has gained 
internationally 
the inquiry into the bombing has focused in part on palestinian 
extremists opposed to arafats recent peace overtures which include 
recognition of israel and on iranianlinked moslem fundamentalists 
among those mentioned as possibly being involved is ahmed jibril 
a former syrian army captain who leads a libyanfunded syriabased 
plo splinter group called the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command 
jibrils group has denied involvement in the incident 
we have expressed readiness to exchange information about this 
incident or any other because we are definitely against 
terrorism khalaf said but until now there have been no 
contacts by the united states with us to translate this into 
action 
an adviser to arafat khaled hassan told the london channel 4 
commercial television network on tuesday that if the perpetrators 
were palestinians and were caught arafat would put them in front 
of the court 
khalaf commenting on that remark said we are not yet in a 
position to put anyone on trialwe cant even lay our hands on 
ahmed jibril

episcopal bishops are expected to act quickly to 
confirm the election of the anglican churchs first woman bishop now 
that standing committees around the country have provided the 
necessary supporting votes 
the rev barbara harris a priest in philadelphia passed the 
milestone late tuesday when an envelope arrived at the episcopal 
diocese of boston containing the 60th vote of support from the 118 
standing committees 
harris needed the approval of a majority of the committees or 
more than 59 votes 
the boston diocese named harris suffragan or assistant bishop 
on sept 24 months of debate followed with several factions 
opposing the election because of her sex 
james solheim spokesman for the diocese said harris had won 
support from roughly two out of three standing committees as of 
tuesday 
the vote was the only serious obstacle to her consecration 
he said the expectation is that the bishops will vote quickly and 
affirmatively 
the bishops balloting will be conducted by mail and the process 
is expected to begin shortly solheim said 
one reason harris is expected to win support of a majority of 
episcopal bishops is that they themselves voted in 1976 to allow 
women priests and bishops 
women have been priests since then but harris would be the first 
female bishop in any branch of worldwide anglicanism 
bishop david e johnson of the boston diocese said in a 
statement i am especially delighted for barbara that the church 
has endorsed her for this new ministry and its an exciting way for 
us to move into the new year 
harris did not return a message left at her office at the 
episcopal church publishing co in philadelphia on tuesday her home 
number has been changed three times because of death threats related 
to her election solheim said 
harris mother and the boston diocese said she was traveling to 
boston 
harris 58 is executive director of the publishing house and 
interim rector of the church of the advocate in philadelphia in 
recent months she has declined to comment until the standing 
committees and the bishops confirm her election 
each standing committee consists of four lay members and four 
members of the clergy

two student journalists have been ordered 
reinstated at dartmouth college by a judge who said their 
suspensions were tainted by bias against the offcampus 
conservative weekly for which they worked 
superior court judge bruce mohl on tuesday said he found no 
persuasive evidence that the students were actually punished for 
their association with the darmouth review 
but he said one member of the panel that disciplined review 
editors christopher baldwin and john sutter harbored substantial 
bias and prejudice against the weekly 
as a result he ordered the ivy league school to reinstate the 
two who could be disciplined again by a reconstituted disciplinary 
panel 
mohls ruling ends the first skirmish on what he described as a 
massive legal battleground in which the students backed by 
prominent conservatives including william f buckley jr and william 
simon say that dartmouth discriminates against conservatives 
mohl generally did not address first amendment claims and other 
core issues in the students pending state and federal lawsuits 
they were suspended in march for 18 months for harassment for 
their role in a classroom confrontation with a black music 
professor william cole a third review staffer involved completed 
his sixmonth suspension a fourth served probation 
the students who are white denied any racial motivation but 
the incident heightened racial tension on the hanover campus where 
baldwin and other students most of them review staffers were 
disciplined for a nighttime sledgehammer attack on antiapartheid 
shanties on campus in 1986 
late tuesday dartmouth had not decided how to respond to the 
ruling 
although the court has temporarily set aside the disciplinary 
committees decision we welcome the courts findings that the 
college has safeguarded the students rights and that the colleges 
discplinary procedures are fair said spokesman alex huppe 
baldwin 21 of hinsdale ill and sutter 22 of st louis 
will return to campus late this week for the term that began tuesday 
after tying up loose ends at their jobs in new york one of their 
lawyers francis murphy said today 
the students are overjoyed with the decision said murphy 
theyve missed dartmouth greatly 
mohl ruled that film professor albert lavalleys presence on the 
ninemember disciplinary panel was fundamentally unfair to the 
students 
the students questioned his objectivity because four months 
before the classroom confrontation he signed a letter condemning the 
review for slanderous articles that seriously threatened the 
principle of academic freedom 
mohl did not judge other issues in the case such as whether the 
suspensions were supported by the evidence or were unduly harsh or 
discriminatory 
but he dismissed claims that two other panel members were biased 
and that yet another member who dropped off the panel before it 
began deliberating prejudiced the outcome by participating at all 
mohl concluded by scolding all the participants in the feb 25 
confrontation in coles classroom 
it cannot help but be noted that had greater civility and less 
discourtesy been observed by all the participants in that brief 
encounter an exhaustive expenditure of human and financial 
assets might well have been avoided mohl wrote underlining 
all

libyan leader moammar gadhafi asked 
moscow to help prevent a possible uslibyan clash in the 
mediterranean by sending ships to an area of planned us maneuvers 
the tanjug news agency said today 
the report from tripoli which gave no source for its 
information was apparently filed shortly after the united states 
announced it had shot down two libyan fighter jets over the 
mediterranean 
tanjug said the news was neither confirmed nor denied in 
libya libyan radio later reported the attack 
tanjug the official yugoslav news agency did not say when 
gadhafi had asked the kremlin to intervene 
the libyan leader reacting to the news about american 
movements in the mediterranean asked moscow to send part of its 
mediterranean fleet to the area of forthcoming american maneuvers to 
avoid direct libyanamerican clashes which could serve as an excuse 
for new american and possibly israeli attacks on vital targets in 
libya tanjug said 
the news agency has a correspondent in tripoli and his reports 
have often proved reliable 
tanjug did not specify which part of the mediterranean gadhafi 
had in mind or how many soviet ships he wanted to see moved 
in naples italy us navy spokesman lt david morris said the 
soviets routinely have a presence in the mediterranean but that he 
did not have specifics on the number or type of soviet vessels there 
now 
tanjug reported libya had taken heavy military precautions 
following word of us fleet in the mediterranean 
gadhafis residence in tripoli has been turned into a 
fortress with new tank and antiaircraft reinforcements tanjug 
reported 
additional antiaircraft batteries have been placed on the roof 
tanjug said adding that frenchbuilt antiaircraft missiles have 
been mounted 
the mobilization of libyas reserve troops has reportedly been 
ordered and military aircraft based at airfields on the 
mediterranean coast have been moved inland to points in the sahara 
desert tanjug said 
guns have been mounted in the streets at key intersections and 
gadhafis personal guard has taken over duties from traffic police 
who normally regulate the movement of vehicles the anency said 
the correspondent also said he had learned that col junis 
jabber the commander of libyas armed forces may have lost his job 
in an ongoing reorganization of the countrys military strength he 
gave no sources for that aspect of the report

israels two largest political parties are 
trying to prevent disclosure of the names of major campaign 
contributors a move denounced by one opposition lawmaker today as 
scandalous behavior 
israeli law does not require disclosure of campaign 
contributions and the total amount of money raised by the parties 
for the 1988 campaign is not known 
but as much as onethird of the money reportedly comes from the 
united states and other foreign countries 
the controversy arose when state comptroller miriam benporat 
announced that in her 1988 report she planned to name every 
contributor who donated more than 50000 shekels 27800 to one or 
more political parties 
the report would cover the recent parliamentary election 
in response the rightwing likud bloc and the leftofcenter 
labor party introduced a joint bill that would give the parliament 
speaker sole authority to publish the comptrollers report on 
election financing and allow the speaker to withhold parts of it 
the speaker is always a member of the largest party and the 
position long has been controlled by labor or likud 
ms benporat met with parliament speaker dov shilansky of likud 
this week to express reservations about the proposed law the 
jerusalem post said 
shlomit lavy a spokeswoman for the comptrollers office refused 
to comment on the report 
spokesmen for labor and likud who recently formed a new 
coalition government did not return telephone messages at their 
offices 
parliament member amnon rubinstein of the leftleaning shinui 
party today criticized the laborlikud proposal 
to me that is scandalous behavior he said we are talking 
about millions of dollars the parties have received from big 
business the very fact that they want to conceal it speaks for 
itself 
rubinstein said the system opened the door to corruption 
somebody who gives huge sums expects the party to give him 
preferential treatment he said in a telephone interview 
the fat cats abroad often give huge sums to both of the big 
parties and then they make sure they get their outlay back in 
investments concessions and other financial privileges 
rubinstein told the jerusalem post 
at the time of the 1988 campaign israeli media reports said 
swiss businessman bruce rappoport donated 15 million to labor and 
us millionaire meshulam riklis gave 1 million to likud 
labor leader shimon peres raised 2 million during a nineday 
trip to the united states in 1988 and likud legislator binyamin 
netanyahu gained nearly 1 million for his party during a similar 
visits reports said 
rubinstein said he has pushed for a 30000shekel 16700 
ceiling on single contributions and a requirement that all 
contributions be made public but that the proposals were killed in 
committee 
us law forbids donations from foreign nationals and limits 
individual contributions to 1000 and donations of political action 
committees to 5000 public disclosure is required

immigration agents looking for illegal 
aliens at workplaces misused search warrants and questioned anyone 
who looked hispanic even if the warrants named only one or two 
people civil rights attorneys charged 
as a trial over the way the immigration and naturalization 
service conducts workplace raids opened tuesday civil rights 
attorneys argued for strict regulations on agents who go to 
factories and farms in search of illegal aliens 
the trial is expected to last several months us district judge 
robert aguilar is presiding 
witnesses will establish that there is a consistent pattern of 
nonspecific or general warrants said suzanne needles 
spokeswoman for the employment law office of the san francisco legal 
aid soiety 
a warrant would name two persons but the ins would arrive with 
as many as 20 agents with guns drawn and visible approach the 
property at high speed locate the two persons named and then 
approach anyone who appeared to be hispanic 
us citizens as well as undocumented aliens have been detained 
she said 
according to court papers in 25 northern california raids the 
ins cited 32 people in search warrants but made 481 arrests 
us attorney joseph russoniello representing the ins contended 
the agency has the right to enter a workplace with a warrant based 
on information that illegal aliens are there once inside agents 
can question and arrest aliens for cause even if those aliens are 
not named in the warrant he said 
the ins used the warrants of inspection solely for entry 
purposes and after entry independently developed the probable 
cause to arrest illegal aliens russoniello said in papers filed 
with the court he also said the ins practices have been upheld by 
other courts 
although the case affects the ins only in northern and central 
california lawyers in the case said it could be influential 
elsewhere

president reagan was awakened early today with 
the news that us navy planes acting in self defense had shot 
down two libyan fighter jets that pentagon officials said had turned 
on the american aircraft 
white house spokesman roman ropadiuk said reagan vacationing at 
his new bel air home was informed about the 5 am est incident by 
national security adviser colin l powell 
popadiuk said powell telephoned the president after conferring 
with white house chief of staff kenneth n duberstein 
the white house staff had come under fire in august 1981 after 
failing to awaken reagan after a similar encounter between us and 
libyan jets 
reagan was awakened about an hour after todays incident in 
contrast to theprevious episode when he was not told for more than 
six hours 
describing the latest incident popadiuk said two f14 jet 
fighters were conducting routine defensive patrols from the uss 
john f kennedy in the mediterranean 
the libyan aircraft approached the us aircraft in a hostile 
manner over international waters and the us aircraft acting in 
selfdefense fired airtoair missiles downing both of the libyan 
aircraft said popadiuk 
there were no reported us injuries 
a pentagon spokesman said the american planes were not in the 
mediterranean because of increased tension between libya and the 
united states over a plant us officials claim libya is using to 
produce chemical weapons 
that spokesman lt col rick oborn said the f14s fired after 
they were approached at high speed by the sovietbuilt mig23s in 
the middle of the mediterranean other pentagon sources said the 
libyan pilots turned on the f14s and activated their targeting 
radar 
us officials have said they have proof libya has started 
producing small amounts of chemical weapons but they are still 
debating whether to try to stop it by force or by international 
diplomatic pressure 
the reagan administration has sought to deter libya from 
producing the lethal arms and to stop other countries from providing 
the libyans with expertise and equipment 
rep stephen solarz dny today urged the administration to 
exhaust all diplomatic attempts before turning to a military 
response 
this is a problem for us to be sure but its also a problem 
for other countries solarz said on abctvs good morning 
america 
so lets before we act unilaterally here first make an effort 
to see whether other countries are willing to join with us he 
said first diplomatically and then if necessary militarily as 
well 
libya contends the facility which the united states has 
designated as a chemical weapons plant near the town of rabta 
about 35 miles southwest of the capital tripoli is only a medicine 
factory libyan leader moammar gadhafi has offered to open the plant 
to international inspection but washington rejected the idea 
gadhafi has launched an international campaign of his own to 
refute the us assertions saying the united states wants an excuse 
to attack his country as it did in 1986 and to kill him the 1986 
air raids against barracks living quarters and other installations 
at tripoli and the coastal city of benghazi came after the reagan 
administration accused libya of having orchestrated the bombing of a 
west berlin discotheque patronized by american servicemen 
several countries including west germany have voiced skepticism 
about the latest us claims but secretary of state george p 
shultz heading a us delegation to an international conference 
beginning saturday in paris on chemical weapons will push the 
american case while there is still time to do something about 
it department spokesman charles redman said 
western assistance in terms of technology expertise 
materials is still required if this plant is going to sustain 
limited production certainly if its going to be able to produce on 
a fullscale basis said redman 
the new york times in todays editions and abctv on tuesday 
night reported that libya has been moving chemicals needed for the 
production of poison gas out of the plant in recent days perhaps to 
clear away evidence before an international inspection both reports 
quoted unidentified us officials 
there was a spill of toxic chemicals at the plant during an 
operational test run last summer the washington post reported in 
todays editions the newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying 
that few details were known about the spill

two consultants made periodic 1000 payments to 
a navy official to help hazeltine corp get inside information to 
compete for a multimilliondollar navy contract court papers allege 
the documents a warrant to search hazeltines offices in 
greenlawn and an affidavit supporting the warrant request were 
unsealed tuesday in us district court 
according to the papers consultant william parkin was hired by 
hazeltine in 1986 to help the company win a 159 million navy 
contract called upm150 to build a battlefield airtraffic control 
system 
parkin split his 1000amonth payment from hazeltine with 
another consultant fred lackner who contacted stuart berlin a 
navy procurement specialist with the naval air systems command 
every few months the consultants gave 1000 to berlin the 
government documents said 
berlin apparently played a significant role in the development 
of the upm150 rfp request for proposal and provided inside 
information to lackner for hazeltines use the papers said 
lackner once told parkin that the information berlin provided was 
information that the company could not obtain on its own 
the affidavit was based in part on conversations recorded from 
parkins phone 
the court papers were unsealed because prosecutors looking into 
fraud and bribery in the procurement of pentagon contracts said the 
investigation phase of their case was complete and the affidavits no 
longer needed to be secret the search warrant was executed in june 
gerard treanor parkins lawyer said our position is that the 
government can try the case outside the courtroom but parkin is 
going to be found innocent before a jury 
in alexandria va additional court documents were released late 
tuesday others are under seal in st louis minneapolis and los 
angeles 
among the alexandria documents was a search warrant of parkins 
house in which investigators said the consultant may have been 
engaged in criminal activity before he retired from the pentagon in 
1983 
telephone intercepts and recorded conversations indicated that 
parkins business has been criminal prior to beginning his 
consulting business he has said that he was helping other 
consultants make money while working at the pentagon by 
providing them with information the document said 
parkin also mentioned working for companies directly while in 
government it said 
a grand jury in alexandria is expected to hand up indictments in 
the case soon possibly as early as this week 
parkin a known target of the pentagon procurement probe had 
been employed by the navys joint cruise missile project office from 
1977 to 1983 
hazeltine a subsidiary of the st louisbased emerson electric 
makes electronics communications in its greenlawn plant 
lt brian cullin a navy spokesman said hazeltine and another 
contractor gould inc had been the final two competitors for the 
upm150 contract which he said has not yet been awarded 
berlin has been transferred to a noncontracting position in the 
navy cullin said 
the papers also briefly mentioned two other military contracts 
involving hazeltine and another consultant thomas muldoon 
muldoon had been hired by hazeltine in 1987 in connection with a 
marine corps digital wideband transmission system contract called 
mrc 139 the affidavit said 
it was alleged that muldoon had discussed various bids for the 
initial 1 million phase of the project with yet another consultant 
mark saunders 
investigators said in the papers that saunders received the bid 
information from george stone a navy employee who previously was 
director of the office of management ervices in the contracts 
division of the space and naval warfare systems command 
stone has been suspended without pay from the navy cullin said 
the third contract involved the navys secure tranceiver and 
ancillaric equipments program the affidavit alleged that parkin and 
muldoon discussed bids made for that project prior to their being 
made public 
cullin said that hazeltine is one of several contractors placed 
on a certification list which requires companies to certify in 
writing that they have not done anything improper in obtaining

leaders of the newlyconvened 101st congress 
are speaking kindly of presidentelect bush and theyre talking 
about cleaning up capitol hills image of corruption especially if 
they can get a pay raise too 
the ceremonial start of the new session on tuesday gushed with 
optimism about what could be accomplished in the next two years 
with the congress more firmly in democratic control and with a new 
republican in the white house 
by working together we can help our new president fulfill his 
beautiful promise of a kinder gentler america said rep jim 
wright dtexas upon his reelection tuesday as speaker of the 
house 
on the other side of the capitol bush in his role of vice 
president administered the oath of office to new and reelected 
senators former majority leader robert c byrd dwva was 
elected president pro tempore of the senate as george mitchell 
dmaine took the floor in byrds old role 
in a sign of cooperation senate leaders are arranging to speed 
up work on confirming bushs appointments hearings on secretary of 
statedesignate james a baker iii are scheduled to start jan 17 
three days before bush becomes president and can send the nomination 
to congress 
today bush leads a joint session of congress to count the 
electoral votes that will make him president on jan 20 
wright pledged the earnest and unstinting cooperation of the 
leadership of this house in helping bush with his foreign policy 
goals and the speaker even thanked his outgoing adversary 
president reagan for his international successes and encouraging 
the growth and sustenance of politial freedom in countries 
throughout the world 
the speaker listed the federal budget and trade deficits and a 
myriad of social needs as requiring bipartisan cooperation 
and he announced that he and republican leader bob michel 
rill will soon appoint a bipartisan panel to review the houses 
ethics code 
wright himself is at the center of an ethics storm in the 
congress the house ethics committee is investigating allegations 
that wright misused his office for personal gain and that he 
revealed government secrets 
four house incumbents were defeated in the last election after 
questions were raised about their personal or campaign finances 
reps harold ford dtenn and robert garcia dny both 
reelected currently are under indictment on criminal charges 
concurrent with the ethics controversy is a new proposal to give 
lawmakers a pay raise of up to 50 percent and the two issues have 
become intertwined 
a presidential advisory board has recommended increasing pay for 
awmakers from the current 89500 to 135000 but it said at the 
same time house and senate members should be banned from accepting 
fees for their speeches critics contend that allowing members to 
pocket up to 2000 for their speeches often to lobbying groups 
reinforces the publics low opinion of capitol hill ethics 
reagan is expected to propose soon a pay raise smaller than the 
commission recommended and that raise would take effect march 1 
unless both houses of congress first vote it down 
if the president goes ahead and proposes a pay raise were 
prepared to go ahead and eliminate the honorariums said rep tony 
coelho of california the thirdranking democrat in the house 
democratic leaders hope to avoid making members vote on the pay 
raise but republican rep tom tauke of iowa announced tuesday that 
he was introducing legislation with the support of three dozen 
lawmakers from both parties to prevent any sidestepping 
the bill would prevent congress from taking a pay raise without 
voting on it first and would delay the boost until after the next 
election 
this legislation not only prevents members from voting for a 
pay increase for themselves during their current term of office it 
would also require each member to take a public stand on this 
issue he said at the very least we owe this to our 
constituents 
talk of a tax increase something bush has vowed to fight also 
cropped up as congress launched another year of battling the federal 
budget deficit but leaders refused to let such seriousness 
interfere with the pomp of the first day 
as the top republican and democratic officers from both chambers 
gathered to receive a ceremonial phone call from reagan reporters 
asked about the chances for a tax boost this year 
the leaders just laughed

soviet media rapidly reported the downing of two 
libyan jet fighters by us navy warplanes today and made light of 
american charges that libya is producing chemical weapons 
tass the official news agency moved its first report on the 
incident as a news briefing at the foreign ministry press center was 
ending 
that dispatch based on an associated press report from 
washington did not repeat the us claim that the navy jets 
attacked the aircraft after being threatened by them over the 
mediterranean 
earlier morning newspapers warned of an impending us military 
attack on libya 
foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh said any unprovoked 
attack on the north african nation would merit worldwide 
condemnation 
gremitskikh speaking at the news briefing before reports of the 
mediterranean incident had been confirmed blamed increasing 
tensions in the region on foes of a middle east settlement 
i believe someone just doesnt like the beginning of 
uspalestinian dialogue and prospects of moving the israeliarab 
conflict off dead center he said 
in such circumstances any unprovoked military action wherever 
it comes from would deal a very serious blow to the process of 
improving the international climate and would deserve condemnation 
from the international community including the soviet union 
gremitskikh added 
the tass dispatch refrained from any commentary echoing 
restraint voiced by the soviet press in earlier reports about 
mounting uslibyan tensions 
despite the kremlins public professions of support for libyan 
leader moammar gadhafi soviet officials privately say they consider 
him impetuous and unreliable 
us officials say libya has begun production of chemical weapons 
at a plant south of the capital tripoli the officials including 
president reagan have indicated a military strike on the plant is 
under consideration 
radio moscow in its report on the incident called us charges 
about the plant groundless 
gremitskikh noted that libya has denied any intent of 
manufacturing chemical weapons and that gadhafi offered to open the 
suspect plant to us inspectors 
he would not say if the libyans have requested military aid from 
the soviets to meet any us attack 
soviet newspapers today warned of an impending us attack on 
libya and made light of the reagan administrations charges that the 
north african nation has begun producing chemical weapons 
washingtons current antilibyan campaign is a relapse of the 
notorious aircraft carrier policy that the united states does not 
at all want to renounce the military daily red star claimed 
pravda said the us accusations were designed to detract 
attention from peace and disarmament proposals that soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev made in a speech to the united nations last 
month 
generally this is a wellknown scenario the communist party 
daily added 
the newspapers used relatively restrained language which could 
indicate soviet wariness about allowing the dispute to damage 
superpower relations 
both pravda and red star printed photographs of the us 
nuclearpowered aircraft carrier theodore roosevelt which the 
military daily said was leading a 13ship us battle group toward 
the mediterranean 
the pentagon says the ship movements are part of a routine 
rotation of forces but pravda headlined its report usa is 
preparing a blow against libya 
pravda reminded readers of the barbaric air raids by us 
warplanes against libya in april 1986 that killed at least 100 
people it said the american air pirates had then killed women 
children and old people 
the north african nation it said has not by chance been 
chosen again as the target of american interference 
it said americans had long been subjected to the stereotype of a 
libyan enemy and that it was easy for the us government to 
revive its antilibyan campaign

tombstones or seated in overflow halls relatives and townspeople 
wept and prayed today for the dead of bombed flight 103 as a 
minister urged them to turn their thoughts away from vengeance 
lockerbie the town where most of the pan am boeing 747 crashed 
after being blown apart by a bomb came to a standstill for the 
40minute service for the 259 people killed aboard the plane and the 
11 residents who died on the ground 
prime minister margaret thatcher in black coat and hat and her 
husband denis joined the other mourners who packed into dryfesdale 
parish church clustered among nearby tombstones or sat in crowded 
hallways 
the local people dignitaries relatives and pan am staff members 
flown in by the airline for the service sang hymns and prayed 
afterward the 63yearold prime minister who visited the crash 
site the morning after the disaster met privately with the 
relatives in a school 
investigators have concluded a bomb blew up the plane and 
suspicions have focused on middle eastern terrorists prompting mrs 
thatcher to advise the united states publicly against eye for an 
eye retaliation 
the right rev james whyte moderator of the church of scotland 
echoed that advice 
justice yes retaliation no he told the congregation from 
the churchs marble pulpit 
we may be tempted indeed urged by some to flex our muscles in 
response to show that we are men whyte said 
to show that we are what to show that we are prepared to let 
more young and more innocent die to let more rescue workers labor 
in more wreckage to find the grisly proof not of our virility but 
of our inhumanity 
that is what retaliation means i for one will have none of 
it and i hope you will not either 
the simple dignified service was televised live to the nation 
and to mourners gathered in a local cinema community hall and 
church 
many preferred to stand in the chilly rain among the old granite 
tombstones outside the church huddled under umbrellas dressed in 
windbreakers and cloth caps 
the lights of the austere presbyterian church shone brightly 
into the gathering afternoon gloom and sheep grazed in a field 
nearby the union jack flew at halfstaff 
inside the 91yearold sandstone church a man cradled his wifes 
head as they sang a hymn and a baby slept on its fathers shoulder 
for the first time in two weeks the skies of lockerbie were 
silent empty of the helicopters that have led a massive search for 
wreckage and bodies over 150 square miles of countryside 
outside the town hall which has become a makeshift mortuary 
wreaths lined the sidewalk and more bouquets were laid outside the 
church 
pan am said it flew several hundred employees and relatives of 
victims to lockerbie including pan am chairman thomas plaskett 
many employees wore the airline uniform at the service 
neil kinnock leader of the opposition labor party also 
attended and us ambassador charles h price ii read one of the 
lessons from the gospel according to st john

rev alan neal of the anglican all saints parish church 
also present were lord jakobovits chief rabbi of the united 
hebrew congregations of the british commonwealth the most rev 
edward luscombe primate of the scottish episcopal church and the 
most rev thomas winning the roman catholic archbishop of glasgow 
the boeing 747 was torn apart by a bomb on dec 21 as it reached 
cruising altitude of 31000 feet wreckage hit homes in lockerbie 
and the fuelladen wings exploded in a deadly pillar of fire 
as search teams continued to hunt for wreckage and victims 
police said 126 of the 242 bodies recovered from the crash had been 
released to relatives 
but police said tuesday they now see little chance of finding the 
missing bodies of 20 passengers and eight local residents they are 
believed to have died in the sherwood crescent area of lockerbie 
where parts of the planes fuselage and wings crashed forming a 
30footdeep crater 
between 80 and 90 percent of the plane has been found but only 
20 percent of it has been picked up police said much of it is in 
inaccessible countryside 
the body of capt james macquarrie the pilot of flight 103 was 
cremated at carlisle 25 miles southeast of lockerbie on friday

foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
said today the federal government has no evidence that a west german 
company helped libya build a plant to produce chemical weapons 
another official a spokesman for genscher later said west 
germany had asked the united states for additional material to 
back up claims that a german company helped build the plant 
genscher before the pentagon announced in washington that us 
warplanes today shot down two libyan fighter jets over the 
mediterranean uslibyan tensions have been building over american 
claims that the libyans have built a plant to make chemical weapons 
speaking at a news conference in bonn genscher said the 
government took very seriously allegations that the 
imhausenchemie company in southwest badenwuerttemberg state was 
involved in the libyan plant 
the foreign minister said that two days after he and chancellor 
helmut kohl were informed nov 16 of us suspicions that libya had 
been helped by the west german company the governments security 
council met to discuss the matter 
genscher declined to disclose details of the discussion 
the government has thus far found no evidence to support the 
allegations against the west german company genscher said 
hanns schumacher a foreign ministry spokesman told reporters 
the government has asked the united states for any additional 
material to prove the allegations such material has not yet 
appeared he said 
in freiburg district state director willi voegele said he has 
informed the federal finance ministry that his investigation has so 
far found nothing connecting the company with the allegations 
voegele said his office was ordered dec 30 to check the companys 
foreign export contacts 
juergen hippenstielimhausen managing director of 
imhausenchemie which employs 500 people has denied the

the nation 
dec 30 
chronicletribune marion ind on base closings 
if grissom air force base in indiana had been on the list 
of military facilities to be closed our attitude might be less 
charitable but we dont think so 
the recommendation by a government commission that 86 military 
installations be closed is only the first of several tough decisions 
the united states must face if the budget deficit ever is to be 
whipped 
from all indications the recommendations were made for all the 
right reasons after a careful and thorough study the primary 
consideration the nations defense should be strengthened by the 
closing or realignment of the military bases 
what do concern us are attemmpts by some congressmen to inject 
politics into what was a nonpolitical process there is no cause 
for any member of congress to claim victory or defeat based on 
whether his or her district lost or kept a military facility 
the process was designed specifically to withstand political 
pressure from congressmen trying to protect bases in their districts 
and thats the way it appeared to work 
the closing of the military facilities while distasteful and 
painful to some are more than justified the savings over the next 
20 years are estimated to be 56 billion

oshkosh wis northwestern on base closings 
the initial reaction to the schedule of military base closings 
was positive nobody with power on armed services committees was 
offended 
but there are plenty of congressmen who have been and the 
reverberations from the release of the listings is settling in 
illinois is one unhappy state what with the inclusion of chanute 
field and fort sheridan on the list 
california is another big loser but texas surprise loses 
very little and the militarybaserich southern states sacrifice 
very little in comparison to what they have 
the chances are great that the list and the closings will be 
sustained in the process ahead 
retiring secretary of defense frank carlucci is expected to 
approve the list he cant legally change it and it will be up to 
congress to act against it if it is not to be implemented 
it is quite unlikely that congress can get enough votes to 
scuttle the plan 
there is something sad about the convolutions of the law that set 
up the commission and require congress to vote up or down on the 
entire package but time has shown that this is the only way 
unnecessary military bases will be abandoned 
congress has shown year after year that if it is left to them 
politicking will rescue even the most superfluous station as 
twisted as is the process it at least seems at last to be getting 
the job done

alamogordo nm daily news on base closings 
many of the communities near the 86 bases under recommendation by 
a government commission for closure will feel the economic pinch if 
the recommendations are approved 
but the nations economy has to be taken into consideration as 
well right now the nation has a large deficit to deal with 
consolidating bases and closing down inefficient bases makes a 
lot of sense the recommendations made by the commission seemed to 
be good ones 
this country has too many problem areas such as the homeless

the morning news tribune tacoma wash on african americans 
it may not catch on but describing americans of african descent 
as african americans is a good idea 
the new term has been coming into favor among some black writers 
and civil rights leaders for several years now 
jesse jackson called attention to the trend and endorsed it 
wholeheartedly at a recent civil rights conference in chicago 
every ethnic group in this country has a reference to some land 
base some historical cultural base he said african americans 
have hit that level of maturity 
more importantly the term african american avoids any 
reference to skin pigmentation which ought to be irrelevant in 
todays america far more relevant are the culture and experience 
shared by a people 
in the case of black americans that experience has been shaped 
by centuries of oppression beginning with the forcible abduction 
and enslavement of their african ancestors blacks hung on to their 
african heritage in the face of slavery and racism creating a rich 
and distinctive new culture that culture cant be understood 
without taking into account its african roots 
african american reflects those roots it also reflects a 
pride in being both african and american the kind of pride felt by 
greek americans polish americans and others whose ancestors came to 
america by choice and suffered less in the new land if most blacks 
now choose to call themselves african americans the rest of the 
country should oblige them and feel honored

the state supreme court has found the selfevident if the state 
promises pensions it must actually set aside the money to pay them 
west virginia politicians have done many things but not that it 
will be interesting to see them comply with court orders enforcing 
common sense 
the justices ruled that the state has shorted the public 
employees retirement system association by at least 80 million over 
the last four years sometimes the governor did it sometimes 
legislators did 
the court ordered the state to repay the money within four years 
the ruling represents a good days work in the system of checks

a leading british conservative said 
today that libya may have paid the price for its aggressive 
stance toward the united states in the downing of two libyan 
warplanes by the us navy 
soviet media quickly reported todays fighting over the 
mediterranean earlier a soviet official said unprovoked attacks on 
libya would merit worldwide condemnation in which the soviets would 
join 
in west germany opposition leaders said they were surprised by 
the incident in spain foreign ministry spokesman juan lena said 
spain follows with attention and concern the development of 
events 
the pentagon reported two of libyas sovietbuilt mig23s were 
shot down early today by us f14s from the aircraft carrier john 
f kennedy the incident was the first fighting between the united 
states and libya since us jets bombed libya in 1986 
roman popadiuk deputy white house press secretary said in los 
angeles that the us warplanes acted in selfdefense after the 
libyan aircraft approached them in hostile manner over 
international waters 
tensions between the two nations rose recently over libyas 
construction of a plant the united states says is intended to 
produce chemical weapons 
roland dumas the french foreign minister said he hoped the 
incident would not dominate an upcoming chemical weapons conference 
in france the meeting will bring together more than 140 countries 
jan 711 to discuss expanding a 1925 treaty banning the use of 
chemical weapons dumas said the downing of the jets reinforces 
the need for this kind of international conference 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany said 
today the federal government has no independent verification that a 
west german company helped build the plant as the united states has 
charged 
michael mates of britains governing conservative party and 
chairman of the parliamentary committee on defense told the british 
broadcasting corp 
if the libyans have made an offensive gesture toward the united 
states im not surprised theyve been shot down because theyre 
not a friendly nation they have committed many aggressive acts 
against the united states 
he said libya has tried to deny the united states access to 
disputed waters they tried to make false claims within the area 
of the mediterranean to keep out american troops who are entirely 
entitled to be in international waters and if theyve paid the 
price well thats tough 
british lawmaker gerald kaufman the opposition labor partys 
spokesman on foreign affairs told bbc television the americans 
ought to show the utmost caution and they really will need to 
justify this activity if theyre going to get any support or even 
understanding from our country 
lockerbie the pan am plane crash last month was an outrage of 
the foulest kind britain has every right to be angry the americans 
have every right to be angry but as prime minister mrs 
margaret thatcher said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth 
is not the way of dealing with it 
he recalled that in 1986 britain allowed washington to use 
bombers based on british soil to bomb libya an attack staunchly 
defended by mrs thatcher and denounced by the labor party 
he said the americans then acted in a very rash and foolish 
way and if the latest incident was part of a move to destroy an 
alleged chemical weapons plant in libya i would regard that as 
unacceptable not because in any way i would support or accept that 
libya should manufacture chemical weapons but because it is 
unacceptable for one country to attack another internally because it 
disagrees with what its doing 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh 
commenting before receiving word of the uslibyan exchange said 
i believe someone just doesnt like the beginning of 
uspalestinian dialogue and prospects of moving the israeliarab 
conflict off deadcenter 
in such circumstances any unprovoked military action wherever 
it comes from would deal a very serious blow to the process of 
improving the international climate and would deserve condemnation 
from the international community including the soviet union

a panel of independent and drug industry 
scientists began today trying to hasten the process for approving 
new drugs to treat cancer and aids a task its chairman says must 
balance patient safety against the need for speedy treatment 
while safety and efficacy must remain of paramount importance 
in permitting the use of new drugs it is also critical that the 
food and drug administrations regulatory procedures be such as to 
not unduly hinder the rapid transfer of new agents to patients with 
cancer and aids said dr armand hammer chairman of the 
presidents cancer panel which appointed the drug study panel 
hammer said the panel of experts has been asked by 
presidentelect bush to review current drug approval procedures and 
determine whether the regulatory processes governing cancer and aids 
drugs should be different from the processes governing development 
of drugs for diseases that are not lifethreatening 
speaking to reporters after his address to the panel meeting at 
the national institutes of health hammer said he believes the 
approval process for cancer and aids drugs should be shortened from 
the current period which varies from two to three years to less 
than one year 
were not going to sacrifice safety and speed he said 
were going to combine safety and speed 
hammer said the fdas recent announcement of new streamlined 
procedures to move drug approvals more quickly are inadequate 
though he did not elaborate 
however he said the involvement of leading pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology companies on the study panel will provide valuable 
insight into the approval process 
dr anthony fauci the aids coordinator at the national 
institutes of health said extraordinary progress has already 
been made in aids research though no cure has been found and only 
one drug has been approved for treatment of aids azt which has 
been shown to prolong the lives of certain aids patients 
there is a lot of despair out there and thats understandable 
because of the terrible scourge of this disease he told panelists 
he said scientists are cautiously optimistic that they will 
develop a drug or combination of drugs within the next few years to 
prolong the lives of aids victims however he said there is 
unlikely that a single drug will be developed that cures the disease

federal prosecutors have dropped criminal 
cases against 17 pilots in orlando and tampa charged with concealing 
drug and alcohol convictions on government forms 
us attorney robert genzman said tuesday the cases were 
dismissed so that the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta 
can decide whether the federal aviation administraion medical forms 
filled out by pilots are vague 
four related cases from tampa have been appealed to the higher 
court and genzman said prosecutors could reinstate the 17 dismissed 
cases if the four cases are upheld 
they were the first in a national crackdown on pilots failing to 
report convictions on faa forms federal officials said they were 
taking the action to ensure air safety 
us district judge george carr threw out cases against five 
pilots in tampa last month ruling that the faa medical forms were 
fundamentally unfair

about 86000 hungarians opposed to the 
construction of a danube river power project have signed a petition 
calling for a referendum on the plant the state news agency mti 
reported wednesday 
president bruno f straub said tuesday night a referendum on the 
plan was inconceivable because parliament has decided to go 
ahead with the project 
environmentalists who say the plant will destroy wildlife 
wetlands and drinking water supplies began the campaign in november 
because they believed parliaments decision in october did not 
reflect the will of the people 
the session approved construction of the nagymaros power plant 
which together with a hydropower station in gabcikovo 
czechoslovakia is to be one of the biggest power generation plants 
on the danube 
environmentalists plan to present the proposal for a referendum 
to straubs presidential council or to parliament once they reach 
100000 signatures the agency said 
straub ruled out a lastminute change in an interview on budapest 
tv saying collecting signatures is a movement by young people 
who want to use the chance to protest against something

here is a transcript of the pentagon briefing 
wednesday by defense secretary frank carlucci and adm william 
crowe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff on the incident in 
which two us navy planes shot down two libyan jet fighters over 
the mediterranean sea 
carlucci good morning 
the chairman and i here to present the facts of the libyan 
incident as we understand them at this point 
and let me emphasize that 
these are preliminary reports and preliminary reports are never 
100 percent accurate 
there are always changes in detail 
but in the interest of getting to the american public and the 
world in general the information that we have were going to 
present a statement based on that information but i urge you to 
take into account the fact that preliminary reports sometimes do 
change 
this morning at about 5 am eastern standard time or 12 am 
local time in the mediterranean two libyan mig23 aircraft were 
shot down in selfdefense by american f14s with airtoair missiles 
two parachutes were sighted and a libyan searchandrescue 
helicopter was later detected headed for the area 
the us navy aircraft were operating from the aircraft carrier 
uss john f kennedy which was off the southwest tip of crete and 
about 127 miles north of tobruk libya indicates location on map 
and there you have the location of the aircraft tobruk is down in 
this region 
at the time of the incident both the ship and its aircraft were 
conducting training operations in international waters 
the two f14s and you have the f14 location right here 
indicates on map were providing combat air patrol approximately 50 
miles south of the kennedy which is some 70 miles north of the 
northeast libyan coast 
the mig aircraft were detected shortly after they left al bumbah 
indicates on map thats right here at about 450 am 
eastern standard time and were tracked as they closed the two f14 
aircraft

<TEXT>
the f14 pilots maneuvered to avoid the closing aircraft 
they changed speed altitude and direction 
the libyan aircraft continued to close in a hostile manner 
at about 14 miles the us section leader decided his aircraft 
was in jeopardy and they could wait no longer 
one mig23 was shot down with a sparrow missile 
the second mig was shot down by a sidewinder missile at six miles 
these 6th fleet ships and aircraft were operating in 
international waters and international airspace at the time of the 
incident and posed no threat to libya 
these routine operations are of the same type that have been 
conducted in the same area many times in the past 
the 6th fleet operations have no connection whatsoever with 
libyas newly constructed chemical facility 
these operations which were conducted over 600 miles northeast 
of the plant and the plant is right down in this region here 
using map 
so you see where the carrier is and its 600 miles away 
it had nothing to do whatsoever with that plant 
we now consider this matter closed 
admiral crowe and i are now prepared to take your questions 
q mr secretary 
q what were the indications of hostile intent youve 
mentioned the fact that the libyan planes continued to close what 
else if anything was there that told the pilots the libyans had 
hostile intentions 
carlucci bear in mind what i said earlier that these are 
preliminary reports 
the pilots are being flown to naples for a detailed debrief 
so we will not know the actual maneuvers that took place until 
we have the detailed debrief from the pilots 
but based on our current information and i emphasize that 
point the pilots descended in altitude from approximately 15000 
feet to 4000 feet and they took some five different evasive 
actions and each time the libyan aircraft sought to put their nose 
on our aircraft they also accelerated 
so the hostile intent seems to be fairly clear 
q mr secretary was the what were the rules of engagement 
that were 
carlucci normal peacetime rules of engagement 
q mr secretary 
carlucci no change there has been no change in the rules of 
engagement 
q mr secretary 
q and there were no communication required then 
q who gave the ok to fire 
q between the f14s and the kennedy 
carlucci excuse me 
q they didnt have to go back to the kennedy and ask for weapons 
release authority or anything like that

here are some recent developments in 
uslibyan relations following the american contention that libya 
had become able to manufacture chemical weapons 
sept 14 the state department says libya now can produce 
chemical weapons and calls that a particularly worrisome 
development in light of a dangerous precedent of use of such 
weapons in the iraniraq war and the general record of 
irresponsible behavior on the part of libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi 
oct 4 in a speech at the united nations the libyan foreign 
minister again demands compensation for the 1986 us air attack on 
two libyan cities an attack in which 41 people were killed 
oct 25 cia director william webster says a libyan chemical 
plant is the largest of its kind the agency has detected webster 
says later he meant the plant is the largest of its kind in the 
developing world 
oct 26 ambassador l paul bremer the governments top 
antiterrorism expert says there was no evidence libyan planned to 
arm terrorists with chemicals but reason to fear it might they 
have no record of restraint he says 
nov 25 a libyan official tells italy his country adheres to 
international prohibitions on the use of chemicals weapons those 
prohibitions do not cover manufacture or ownership 
dec 19 the state department says libya is on the verge of 
fullscale production and calls on all countries to deny related 
technology to libya iran and iraq 
dec 21 in a televised interview president reagan says the 
united states has discussed military action against the chemical 
weapons plant with allies and thats a decision that has not been 
made yet 
dec 22 libya denies it has built a chemical weapons plant and 
says doctors nurses and pharmacists are planning a sitin 
apparently to discourage any attack on what it says is a 
pharmaceutical factory white house spokesman marlin fitzwater says 
military action is an option were not ruling it out 
dec 23 presidentelect bush says he shares reagans 
determination to prevent the plant from spreading further 
destruction but declines to spell out what he thinks should be 
done the arab league says it is not true that libya is producing 
chemical weapons 
dec 25 iran iraq and syria announce support for libya in the 
dispute 
dec 28 reagan extends for six months us economic sanctions 
against libya first imposed in 1986 the action froze libyan assets 
in the united states and forbade certain dealings with libya 
including oil production by us companies there 
dec 29 libyas ambassador to tunisia predicts better relations 
with the united states under the incoming bush administration the 
ambassador repeats denials that his country has built a chemical 
weapons plant 
dec 30 the united states rejects an offer by gadhafi conveyed 
through italy for an international inspection of the plant a 
single inspection could not be conclusive because the plant 
could easily be modified to appear as a legitimate industrial 
chemical plant the state department says 
jan 3 1989 the state department says it has proof libya has 
begun limited production and says the united states will raise the 
issue at a nato meeting in paris beginning saturday while there is 
still time to do something about it the defense department says 
the sailing of an aircraft carrier battle group from norfolk va to 
the mediterranean is a standard deployment 
jan 4 the pentagon announces the shooting down of two libyan 
fighters by us planes the washington post reports the plant 
suffered a spill of toxic chemicals last summer the new york times 
and abctv report recent movement of chemical raw materials out of 
the plant

is backed by brute force and in spite of the threats the 
revolutionaries of great libya will not bow their heads and will not 
abandon their principles and the objectives of their eternal

uslibyan clash in the mediterranean 
libyas foreign ministry said the us shot down the libyan jet

libyan ambassador abdel rahman shalgam called todays incident 
a unilateral act and a dangerous action of escalation by the 
united states in its response to the chemical plant situation he 
declined to say how libya would respond 
on tuesday us officials said for the first time they had 
evidence the plant had begun producing limited quantities of 
chemical weapons 
libyan officials including gadhafi have insisted the plant near 
tripoli will make pharmaceuticals and offered to let international 
experts inspect the facility the reagan administration has rejected 
the offer for a onetime inspection 
referring to the us insistence that the plant is a chemical 
weapons facility shalgam said of the us administration why 
dont they wait until the start of an international conference on 
chemical weapons scheduled to begin this weekend in paris 
we are willing to accept any international measure regarding 
chemical arms he said as long as it applied to all nations but he 
said the united states was evidently not willing to do so 
he stressed that libya said it would open the plant in a few 
weeks for inspection so that the whole world could see

the us downing of two libyan jet fighters 
wednesday was the latest in a series of military clashes between the 
two countries during president reagans eightyear tenure 
on april 14 1986 waves of us landbased and carrierbased 
warplanes carried out a series of middleofthenight bombing raids 
on libya the us planes dumped one bomb 10 yards from the 
residence of libyan leader moammar gadhafi in his tripoli fortress 
headquarters reportedly killing his baby daughter two crewmen from 
a us f111 were killed in the action 
president reagan ordered the 1986 attack in retaliation for what 
us officials said was libyan involvement in the bombing of a 
nightclub in berlin frequented by us soldiers a us soldier and 
a turkish woman were killed by the berlin bomb 
among us allies in europe only britain cooperated and other 
countries refused to permit us planes to fly over their 
territories as a result the britishbased f111s used in the 
attack had to be refueled in the air several times in a long dogleg 
flight over the atlantic ocean through the straits of gibraltar and 
over the mediterranean to libya 
on march 24 1986 libya fired surfacetoair missiles missing 
us aircraft the united states retaliated saying it hit two 
libyan patrol boats and a missile battery at sirte libya 
the following day the united states renewed its attack hitting 
the missile site again and two more libyan boats 
in june 1983 navy f14s intercepted two libyan fighters outside 
the gulf of sidra but there was no shooting 
an armed confrontation on aug 19 1981 was similar to todays 
incident two soviet built mig23s were downed today by f14 planes 
from the aircraft carrier john f kennedy there were no us 
casualties officials said two libyan parachutes were seen 
in the 1981 clash us f14 fighters shot down two sovietbuilt 
libyan su22 fighter planes over the mediterranean in a oneminute 
battle off the libyan coast 
the pentagon said the planes were shot down after an unprovoked 
attack by the libyans as the us jets from the aircraft carrier 
uss nimitz patrolled above a navy task force conducting a routine 
exercise more than 100 miles off shore in the gulf of sidra 
none of the americans in the twoman f14s was hurt in the 
incident one libyan pilot was seen parachuting from his stricken 
plane 
the libyans disputed the us account claiming their planes were 
on routine surveillance missions 
libya has claimed the gulf as its territory since 1973 but the 
united states does not recognize the claim

so in my judgment the speculation has been excessive but let 
me emphasize we do not comment on military contingencies 
q mr secretary could you clarify 
q mr secretary let me follow up that was triggered by that 
was triggered by president reagans own statement that he was 
considering a military option 
carlucci i dont think thats what the president said if you go 
back and look at his actual statement 
but in any event the reports im referring to are reports that 
you all have been putting out from the pentagon 
q mr secretary 
q do you have any indication 
q mr secretary were the planes capable of making an attack on 
the socalled weapons or chemical weapons plant were those f14s 
carlucci if you were going to make an attack on the chemical 
plant you would not position your carrier some 600 miles away i 
think thats selfevident 
q mr secretary 
crowe nor used f14 aircraft 
q mr secretary 
q was there any indication that the planes were going to fire 
that the migs were going to fire 
carlucci ive indicated that by their maneuvers they were 
clearly acting in a hostile fashion 
q did they paint with their radar 
q did we have a radar 
q did they lock on with the radar 
crowe once again let me emphasize the point we have some 
preliminary information that radars were turned on 
we do not know the nature of the radars 
we do not until we debrief the pilots it is really not 
appropriate to get into that kind of detail 
pentagon spokesman dan howard mr secretary 
q mr secretary other than the migs were there any other 
howard lets not have a shouting match here we have so many 
people who want to ask questions why dont we do it by raising your 
hands and let the secretary recognize you 
q mr secretary other than the migs that were shot down were 
there any other libyan forces in the area that you are aware of 
carlucci not that were aware of inaudible 
q mr secretary could you describe any planetoplane 
conversations between the americans and the libyans or perhaps any 
other conversations 
carlucci thats a little detail that we shouldnt get into until 
weve had the debriefing of the pilots 
q mr secretary 
q well we understand they were warned can you tell us how they 
were warned 
carlucci no im not aware of any warnings 
q mr secretary 
q mr secretary in the previous week or 10 days had there been 
any report from the area of suspicious or threatening behavior by 
the libyans of any kind 
carlucci no not to my knowledge bill 
q we had reconnaissance planes up over the past week or 10 days 
around the carrier they were never challenged or threatened in any 
way by the libyans until this morning 
carlucci there have been normal challenges and this activity 
took place in what is called a flight information region where you 
do have these kind of challenges to identify aircraft 
this has no legal standing 
its an icao regulation but these kinds of challenges are normal 
we do it ourselves 
that has nothing to do with carrier training operations 
q what youre saying is if the libyans had behaved the way they 
behaved this morning a week or two weeks or three weeks ago we 
would have shot them down then too

carlucci any time an aircraft demonstrates clear hostile intent 
and on the basis of our preliminary information this is certainly 
the case here our aircraft are entitled under the rules of 
engagement to defend themselves 
q mr secretary what happened after this incident was there 
any scrambling of libyan jets any libyan activities that followed 
this incident 
carlucci other than the sar operation search and rescue 
operation i have no indications of any other libyan activity 
q mr secretary could you clarify earlier you said that you 
consider the case closed does that mean that were back to 
business as usual theres no extra alerts theres no further 
military action under way just go back to where you were 
carlucci that is correct 
we will continue with our training operations and the carrier 
will continue its course into port 
q no special alerts have been issued 
carlucci no special alerts 
q just to clarify mr secretary 
q mr secretary the navy is saying excuse me that the 
planes were warned in english to break off are you saying that 
there was no such warning or youre just 
carlucci i know of no warning 
once again we will debrief the pilots but at this point we 
know of no warnings 
q mr secretary you said the can i just go ahead i cant 
raise my hand here because im in front of the tv people 
carlucci yes go ahead laughter 
q you said that the kennedy had arrived in the area around 
christmastime and had begun training operations at that point is 
that correct 
carlucci admiral crowe said that 
crowe it arrived in the area 
it had been in port over the holidays and then left port to go to 
the eastern mediterranean 
q when was the last time sir prior to that that it had 
conducted training operations in this region 
crowe i dont know about the kennedy but we were in this 
specific area in october 
q mr secretary 
carlucci weve conducted training operations in this area 
routinely to staff i think barney what is it some 12 times 
staff twelve times during the last year and prior to oct 18 in 
that specific area 
q mr secretary i wonder if you could compare the normal 
challenges that you said occur in this area compared with what 
happened today and why this was perceived to be hostile action as 
opposed to what normally occurs 
carlucci well any pilot can determine the difference 
it depends on the maneuvers that the aircraft take 
if you fly out and simply ask an aircraft to identify itself 
thats one thing 
if youre coming directly at an aircraft accelerating in speed 
and you when the aircraft maneuvers to get out of your way you 
reposition yourself so that you are basically in a firing position 
then the hostile intent is clear 
but let me emphasize the point again until we have debriefed the 
pilots we cannot present you with all the details 
q but did the f14 
q when do you expect that to take place 
carlucci the pilots are en route to naples right now 
q mr secretary you said that their our f14s reduced 
altitude and changed their headings and the migs positioned 
themselves back on their head the normal firing position in the 
gulf preferred gulf firing position is behind did we change 
altitude to get the same altitude as the migs and would we not 
could they not have considered our changing altitude a maneuver to 
get on their tail 
carlucci no based on once again based on the information we 
have today there is no way that the libyans could have interpreted 
our evasive maneuvers as hostile intent 
q were the migs lower than us did we reduce our altitude to get 
to the same altitude of those or get below 
carlucci actually they went below the migs 
q you said this had no connection to the chemical weapons plant 
but didnt that dispute over the chemical weapons plant create 
heightened tensions and did that in some way contribute to what 
happened 
carlucci we have expressed our grave concern over the chemical 
weapons plant 
there is a conference convening in paris on jan 7 to deal with 
the worldwide issue of chemical weapons 
we are exploring this subject within the context of that 
conference 
we will of course at that conference express our concerns about 
the libyan facility 
but there is no way in which our military routine military 
training can contribute to heightened tensions in the area 
q do you think this incident will have any impact on this whole 
dispute about the chemical weapons plant 
carlucci i indicated that we consider the incident closed 
q mr secretary do you 
howard ladies and gentlemen i think weve exhausted the 
imformation available to us thank you very much mr secretary 
carlucci thank you

britain today announced its agreement to the soviet 
union playing host to a human rights conference in 1991 paving the 
way for a speedy start to new eastwest talks on cutting 
conventional forces in europe 
a foreign office statement said britains turnabout followed 
substantial improvement in the soviet human rights record sources 
in washington said tuesday that president reagan also has decided to 
approve holding the conference in moscow 
the foreign office said british agreement in principle hinged on 
the soviet union establishing effective guarantees of freedom of 
speech religion and emigration by 1991 
britain and the united states had taken the toughest line on 
moscows ambition to host the conference and todays announcement 
opened the way to wrapping up 35nation talks between east and west 
in vienna due to end this month 
the ending of the current conference on security and cooperation 
in europe talks in vienna is a prerequisite for starting new 
eastwest negotiations on reducing conventional weapons and troops 
in europe 
the foreign office statement cited a string of improvements in 
the soviet unions human rights record including it said allowing 
jews and others to emigrate freeing political prisoners and ending 
the jamming of western broadcasts 
it said that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in an address 
to the united nations last month had promised to reform the soviet 
criminal code and include human rights in new legislation 
this is a substantial improvement in soviet human rights 
performance which we welcome said the foreign office statement 
nonetheless much remains to be done and we shall continue to 
monitor the reforms carefully between now and 1991 
the british statement said that by 1991 we shall expect to 
see 
implementation of gorbachevs promised changes in the criminal 
code 
effective guarantees for freedom of religion speech and 
emigration 
an end to the imprisonment of people for their political or 
religious beliefs or their incarceration in psychiatric hospitals 
that all longterm refuseniks are allowed to emigrate 
it added that the moscow conference should be held under the same 
conditions as other conference on security and cooperation in 
europe talks held in the west 
the conference needed approval of all 35 memberstates and 
britain and the united states took the lead in setting conditions 
for moscow which wants the conference to set the seal on 
gorbachevs reformist policy 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze stunned 
participants when the vienna talks opened in 1986 by proposing a 
human rights conference in moscow 
senior officials of the british conservative government described 
the proposal as outlandish and one top policymaker likened it to 
holding a whiskey distillers convention in riyadh capital of 
teetotaling saudi arabia 
but since then western countries have acknowledged changes or 
promises of change by gorbachev 
austria as host of the talks in vienna has invited the 
participating nations to attend a threeday closing meeting jan 17 
the new conventional stability talks on arms and troop reductions 
are due to be held between the 16 nato countries and the seven 
members of the communistled warsaw pact military alliance 
the mandate for the talks is scheduled to be part of the final 
accord of the vienna meeting 
the new conventional arms talks will replace the unsuccessful 
mutual and balanced force reduction talks on reducing forces in 
central europe which started in vienna in 1973 and produced no 
results

solidarity leader lech walesa interviewed 
by the communist party weekly polityka for the first time since 
martial law was imposed predicted authorities will have to 
reinstate his union one way or the other 
the 400000circulation newspaper published the fullpage 
interview in its jan 7 edition which sold out quickly at one busy 
newsstand when it became available wednesday 
the appearance of the interview in the influential weekly 
formerly edited by prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski and often 
used to convey official party positions was a further hint that 
authorities have accepted walesa as a partner for discussions and 
are reconsidering the ban on solidarity since 1982 
under the headline thats why we must come to an agreement 
the interview presented walesa defending the right of solidarity to 
exist the staterun pap news agency also carried excerpts of the 
interview indicating they likely would appear in official 
newspapers thursday 
the authorities will grant the union whether they want to or 
not walesa said pointing to simmering public frustrations 
only will it be by force or without and what will be the costs 
the publication came one day after government spokesman jerzy 
urban made clear that authorities are ready to begin talks on the 
chief opposition demand the restoration of the legal status of 
solidarity seven years after it was suppressed in a martiallaw 
crackdown 
walesa has declined to enter the talks saying he first wants 
confirmation of official willingness to legalize solidarity the 
government says the talks should start with no preconditions 
legalization of solidarity is the key issue walesa said in 
the interview 
i repeat we do not want to overthrow the authorities a 
compromise is in our common interest the interest of poland is 
the order of the day this is the supreme cause thats why we must 
come to agreement with each other 
walesa also indicated that if legalized the union would strive 
for moderation 
we agree there cannot be constant strikes struggle any 
attempts at taking over power we can guard against this however we 
shall not allow ourselves to be divided to be left without 
guarantees that we can maintain our independence he said 
although the interviewers pressed walesa on what guarantees he 
could offer authorities walesa refused to be specific saying that 
he could only discuss such guarantees in private with authorities 
but he said he understood officials concerns i understand the 
fears on both sides how could one help it 
marian turski who conducted the interview for polityka with 
fellow political journalist jerzy baczynski said wednesday the idea 
for the interview came up at a dec 13 newspaper editorial meeting 
walesa was telephoned 30 minutes later and agreed to the suggestion 
immediately turski said 
the main part of the interview was conducted dec 14 at st 
brygidas church in gdansk but walesa added some comments after a 
communist party plenum dec 2021 turski said 
we came to the conclusion that through the interview we could 
accelerate certain things as far as achieving national consensus 
said turski and that is among other things the role of our 
paper 
in its 31year history polityka has served the top party 
leadership as a sounding board for controversial ideas and a way to 
prepare the ground for major decisions or to define the limits of 
acceptable comment 
the paper first interviewed walesa shortly after the august 1980 
gdansk shipyard strike agreement that marked the beginning of 
solidarity 
the recent interview came out between two sessions of a communist 
party plenum at which central committee members have been asked to 
reconsider the issue of solidarity the second part of the plenum is 
expected as early as next week 
if the party indicates that it will make solidarity legal again 
walesa has said he would start negotiations with the government at 
longdelayed talks on how the union would be restored and other 
problems facing poland the talks were proposed by the government 
during a wave of strikes in august 
it was not the first interview of walesa since martial law the 
weekly konfrontacje broke the unofficial ban on walesa in the 
official press with an interview published in september 
walesa also appeared uncensored on nationwide television nov 30 
in a debate with official unions chief alfred miodowicz which 
authorities said was one of the mostwatched tv shows in polish 
history

us navy planes today shot down two libyan jet 
fighters over the mediterranean sea after the american aircraft were 
threatened while conducting routine operations in international 
airspace administration officials said 
defense secretary frank carlucci emphatically denied that the two 
american f14s and their host aircraft carrier the uss john f 
kennedy were in the area with the intention of attacking a libyan 
chemical weapons factory 
the 6th fleet operation had no connection whatsoever with 
libyas newly constructed chemical facility these operations were 
conducted over 600 miles northeast of the facility carlucci 
said at a pentagon news briefing 
we now consider this matter closed he said 
the air battle was the first fighting between the united states 
and libya since american jets bombed tripoli in 1986 and came amid 
rising tension between the two countries over libyas construction 
of the plant 
at the state department spokesman charles redman also said there 
was no link between the plant and the warplane incident there is 
absolutely no connection to any other story or concern you may 
have he said it may be ironic but the two things are not 
related 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi called the downing of his jets an 
act of increased american terrorism and vowed to meet 
challenge with challenge the official libyan news agency jana 
said 
the american force posed no threat to libya and the fighters 
were operating under normal peacetime rules of engagement 
carlucci said referring to the guidelines on when us servicemen 
can open fire on forces that are thought hostile 
the commander of the f14 patrol made the decision to fire at the 
libyan aircraft in selfdefense and apparently shot down both 
planes said carlucci the four crewmen of the two planes were being 
flown to a us base at naples italy for debriefing he said 
at the time of the incident both the ship and its aircraft 
were conducting training operations between the greek island of 
crete and libya he said the aircraft carrier was 127 miles north 
of tobruk libya and the f14s were providing combat air patrol 
50 miles south of the kennedy which is some 70 miles north of the 
northeast libyan coast he said 
carlucci said the f14s descended from 15000 to 4000 feet in 
altitude and attempted five seperate evasive maneuvers they 
changed speeds altitude and direction he said 
the libyan aircraft continued to close in a hostile manner 
he said each time the libyan aircraft sought to put their nose 
on our aircraft they also accelerated so the hostile intent seems 
to be fairly clear he said 
at about 14 miles the us section leader decided that his 
aircraft was in jeopardy and he could wait no longer one mig23 was 
shot down with a sparrow missile the second mig was shot down by a 
sidewinder missile at six miles he said 
afterwards he said two parachutes were sighted and a libyan 
search and rescue helicopter was later detected headed for the 
area it was not clear whether the libyan pilots survived 
the confrontation occurred about noon local time or 5 am est 
the two mig23s were spotted by radar taking off from the al 
bumbah airfield in eastern libya climbing to 9000 feet and then 
accelerating and closing in on the f14s which were at 15000 feet 
officials said 
officials said there were no indications that the libyans fired 
before the two american jets downed them 
sen sam nunn chairman of the senate armed services committee 
said indications are that libya violated what we call the rules 
of engagement they maneuvered themselves into a position to be 
able to shoot down american planes the rules of engagement permit 
selfdefense in those circumstances 
under those circumstances clearly it was libya that took 
the provocative action nunn dga told atlanta radio station 
wgst 
gadhafi never learns said senate republican leader bob dole 
of kansas maybe this time he will finally get it straight 
whenever he threatens american forces we will defend ourselves 
in rome libyas ambassador to italy abdel rahman shalgam 
called todays incident a unilateral act and a dangerous 
action he declined to say how libya would respond 
the libyan foreign ministry said that as libyan reconnaissance 
aircraft were carrying out a patrol over international waters us 
aircraft carried out a premeditated attack on them and shot them 
down 
the jana news agency said the foreign ministry also ordered its 
united nations representative to present an urgent complaint to 
the security council concerning the aggression perpetrated by the 
usa against two libyan reconnaissance planes and to demand 
the holding of an urgent security council meeting on this subject 
president reagan vacationing at his new home in los angeles was 
awakened and informed of the aerial confrontation about an hour 
after it occurred deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk 
said 
he said national security adviser colin l powell telephoned the 
president after speaking with white house chief of staff kenneth 
duberstein about the incident 
the awakening of reagan contrasted with an incident in august 
1981 in which white house aides ran into criticism for not awakening 
the president after a similar encounter between us and libyan jets 
presidentelect bush also was told of the incident by telephone 
at 6 am est and was bring kept informed of developments 
spokeswoman sheila tate said 
popadiuk said the us fighters were threatened while 
conducting routine operations in international airspace north of 
tobruk 
we will continue with our training operation he said 
there is no indication of any further libyan movements outside of 
the search and rescue operation there was no change in the rules of 
engagement i wish to stress that our aircraft were on a routine 
training operation and posed no threat to libya 
the incident came amid rising tensions and concern over what the 
united states says is a newly constructed plant to make chemical 
weapons about 35 miles southwest of the libyan capital tripoli 
on tuesday us officials said for the first time they had 
evidence the plant had started producing limited quantities of 
chemical weapons and has conducted trial runs of its production 
equipment 
libya has claimed the plant will make pharmaceuticals and offered 
to let international experts inspect the plant the united states 
claimed the offer was inadequate 
gadhafi has claimed that the united states is using the 
allegations as a pretext to attack his north african country 
reagan pointedly refused to rule out a military strike at the 
plant and the united states was scheduled to discuss the plant at 
an international conference in paris beginning saturday 
the president told an interviewer last month that a military 
attack on the plant had been discussed but added that is a 
decision that has not been made yet 
the movement of a us carrier group headed by the uss theodore 
roosevelt toward the mediterranean last week had prompted 
speculation of an impending strike against libya the pentagon 
described it as a standard deployment and rotation of duty with 
the kennedy carrier group

the world bank is raising interest rates for 
more prosperous third world countries to 765 percent annually the 
first such increase since the bank began lending at variable rates 
in 1982 officials said wednesday 
the rate will apply during the first six months of this year on 
37 billion worth of loans to about 70 countries said sheldon 
rappaport a spokesman for the bank 
for the second half of 1988 the rate was 759 percent the 
increase amounts to only 006 percent but will cost the borrowers an 
additional 11 million rappaport estimated the rate is based on 
the cost of the banks own borrowings and will be recalculated in 
mid1989 the bank gets most of its funds from borrowing on world 
markets 
the bank is owned by 151 governmwents with the united states 
holding the largest block of shares and is the biggest single 
source of aid to third world countries to help raise their living 
standards it lends more than 19 billion a year 
when it introduced variable interest rates on most of its loans 
in july 1982 the annual rate was 1143 percent since then the 
rate has been reduced each time it was recalculated twice a year 
the poorest countries which borrow from the banks international 
development association will continue to get loans for 40 years at 
less than 1 percent a year with long grace periods during which 
only interest is due

vice president george bush declared himself 
winner of the 1988 presidential election today in a quaint 
constitutional ceremony certifying the ballotbox triumph he gained 
last november 
this announcement shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of 
the persons elected president and vice president of the united 
states bush said after reading the results of the electoral 
college ballots 
he immediately shook hands with house speaker jim wright and 
grinned as members of the house and senate accorded him a standing 
ovation 
bushs pronouncement of his election and that of vice 
presidentelect dan quayle before a joint session of congress capped 
a carefully choreographed bit of stagecraft as old as the republic 
the final tally gave bush 426 votes democrat michael dukakis 
received 111 and democratic vice presidential running mate lloyd 
bentsen received one 
that comported almost exactly with the results of the election 
with the exception of one west virginia elector margarette leach of 
west virginia who cast her vote for bentsen instead of dukakis 
quayle did not attend the votecounting ceremony his office 
said because he had no official role and thought it more important 
to work on private meetings concerning hiring his staff and plans 
for the jan 20 inauguration 
he didnt want to go it would have just been a photo op 
said press secretary dave beckwith adding that quayles staff had 
discussed the matter with the bush staff since quayle is no longer 
a senator his successor was sworn in tuesday and not yet the 
vice president there was no need for him to be there beckwith said 
the outcome was utterly lacking in suspense yet it was an event 
that has not occurred in precisely these circumstances since the 
days of martin van buren the constitution requires that the vice 
president preside over the ceremony and as bush occasionally points 
out van buren was the last vice president to win election directly 
to the white house 
thus he was the last man who presided over the ceremony that 
certified his own triumph in 1837 
bush was greeted by applause when he led a parade of senators 
into the house chamber for the ceremony two pages carried the 
electoral college votes cast by the states into the house in two 
mahogany boxes 
the vice president then mounted the speakers rostrum of the 
house chamber for the ceremony four lawmakers opened and pronounced 
the electoral college results from each of the 50 states and the 
district of columbia regular in form and authentic and announed 
the results 
if there was no suspense bush injected a note of humor when 
rep frank annunzio dill simply said that arkansas had cast six 
votes for president bush interrupted and said the chair wonders 
who won that one 
bush did along with 39 other states and the right to the white 
house 
at the same time bush savors his presidential election victory 
aides say he is close to making the final appointment to his 
cabinet that of energy secretary james schlesinger who served in 
the post during the carter administration remains the leading 
candidate according to one republican source 
bush also is expected to appoint a drug czar within the next few 
days 
he met privately tuesday with sen dennis deconcini dariz and 
the arizona republic reported that deconcini is a top contender for 
that job deconcini would not discuss specifics of the meeting 
highlevel appointments aside bushs trip to the capitol for the 
electoral college ceremony closed the circle on the election of 1988 
bush was in the capitol on tuesday as well presiding over 
swearingin ceremonies for 33 new and newly reelected senators he 
took time out long enough to renew loud and clear his campaign 
pledge to oppose higher taxes 
its funny ive talked to about 33 new senators and not one of 
them has said that to me bush said when asked if a possible tax 
ncrease had been discussed 
he said of his campaign pledge the american people have heard 
it loud and clear 
despite bushs comments many democrats and some republicans 
believe he will have to change his mind to win agreement on a 
comprehensive plan to reduce the federal budget deficit 
bush performed the senatorial swearing in chores twice first in 
a formal ceremony on the senate floor administering the oath of 
office to senators in groups of four he then did it one by one in a 
hall where photographers were permitted 
the presidentelect jokingly told reporters he was going to 
make a little news up here for you guys 
but when he was asked whether he intends to fight a subpoena to 
testify in the irancontra trial of former white house aide oliver 
north bush retorted i dont want to make that much news

president reagan has decided to support a 
schedule of three human rights conferences including a 1991 session 
in moscow the white house announced today 
deputy press secretary roman popadiuk said reagan has authorized 
the us delegation in vienna to support the threeconference plan 
in cooperation with likeminded allies to encourage continued 
progress on human rights in the soviet union 
the conferences are scheduled to take place in paris in 1989 
copenhagen in 1990 and moscow in 1991 he said 
a white house statement noted significant progress on soviet 
human rights in the past three years including release of hundreds 
of political prisoners and an end to jamming of voice of america 
radio liberty and other western broadcasts 
but popadiuk added the president recognizes that there is much 
yet to be done in the soviet union before that nation meets 
acceptable and universal human rights standards 
us agreement to participate in the conference signals american 
support for soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs internal reforms 
and sets the stage for the opening of new eastwest negotiations on 
cutting troops and arms in europe 
the human rights conference and the european arms negotiations 
are linked and secretary of state george p shultz has recommended 
they proceed based on soviet advances in human rights a us 
official had told the associated press on tuesday 
reagan on vacation in california decided tuesday to accept 
shultzs advice said another official who also spoke on condition 
he not be identified 
shultz on sunday is to meet with soviet foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze in paris where they will be attending a conference 
of more than 100 nations on ways to halt the proliferation of 
chemical weapons 
the start of conventional arm reduction talks between the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact has been awaiting 
completion of a 35nation review in vienna of human rights in the 
soviet union and in eastern europe 
evidently reagan has seen enough progress in the soviet record 
to close the conference in vienna and move on 
its not a perfect scorecard but theyve done a lot said 
one us official who spoke on condition of anonymity theyve 
come amazingly far 
the state department last friday credited the soviets with 
significant progress in its treatment of political prisoners and 
jewish citizens who are refused permission to emigrate 
the soviets have released more than 600 political prisoners in 
the last two years including all the monitors of the 1975 helsinki 
agreement which held out the promise of an improvement in the human 
rights situation phyllis oakley the state department spokeswoman 
said last friday 
all prisoners charged with violating political or religious 
constraints are now free and less than a dozen of 120 cases of 
soviet citizens denied permission to join family members abroad 
remain unresolved mrs oakley said 
jamming of ussponsored radio broadcasts has ceased and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev in his speech dec 7 to the un 
general assembly pledged that laws bearing on human rights would be 
changed she said 
they have made significant progress mrs oakley said i 
think thats clear from the examples ive given 
meanwhile the national conference on soviet jewry reported on 
monday that 3652 jews left the soviet union in december the 
highest monthly total since december 1979 
the exodus for 1988 totaled 19287 the highest for any year 
since 1980 when 21471 jews left 
shoshana s cardin chairman of the conference said we welcome 
the marked increase in jewish emigration in 1988 however we had 
hoped that the 2696 refuseniks remaining in the soviet union would 
have been granted permission in a true expression of glasnost 
openness let us hope that the trend toward increased emigration 
will continue in 1989 and that all remaining refuseniks will be 
included 
jewish emigration is one of the yardsticks used by the united 
states to measure soviet performance on human rights the soviets 
recently turned over to the state department a list of about 50 
refuseniks mostly from the leningrad area that were to be given 
exit permits 
this was one of the moves that prompted shultz to recommend us 
approval of a soviet proposal for holding an international human 
rights conference in moscow 
soviet imprisonment of about 30 citizens on criminal charges is 
another problem that from the us view appears to be easing the 
state department suspects political motives for some of those 
imprisonments 
the soviets have proposed a negotiating forum in which us 
officials would have access to court records and could present their 
concerns that some prisoners may be the victims of trumpedup 
charges the official said 
gorbachev has been eager to host a human rights conference in 
moscow to demonstrate the reforms he has undertaken 
it is intended as a review of the 1975 helsinki agreement which 
was signed by the united states the soviet union canada and 32 
european countries reviews are due to be held in paris this year 
and in copenhagen in 1990 
in order to gain what moscow took to be western acceptance of the 
postworld war ii borders of eastern europe the soviets in 1975 
agreed to accelerate the exchange of democratic ideas across the 
eastwest divide 
ever since the united states and its allies have used the 
helsinki accord to pressure moscow to improve human rights 
conditions

a university president in nanking appealed 
wednesday for african students to return to the campus where a fight 
with chinese touched off racial hostility that has spread to at 
least four cities 
in beijing the nearly 500 african students at the beijing 
languages institute boycotted classes wednesday a day after chinese 
demonstrated against an alleged attack by a black student on a 
chinese woman 
brothers let us unite and fight for dignity said a leaflet 
distributed by africans at the institute black is beauty 
in wuhan an industrial city in central china about 300 chinese 
students threw rocks at the african students dormitory allegedly 
beat up a sri lankan student and put up posters saying black 
devils go home in a disturbance saturday at the central china 
polytechnical college foreigners said wednesday 
in the eastern city of hangzhou about 50 africans were in their 
second week of boycotting classes over what they say was an attempt 
by university authorities to isolate them by saying they had aids 
liang ruiju head of hehai university in nanking said he hoped 
for the prompt return of about 40 africans who have been isolated at 
a guest house outside the eastern chinese city for nine days 
we have made full preparations to welcome foreign students to 
return to school to study liang was quoted by the official xinhua 
news agency as saying he said there are a small number of african 
students who do not study hard behave poorly and often fight and 
make trouble 
but he said hehai university has treated students from all 
countries equally and never discriminated against african students 
the 40 african students city officials put the number at more 
than 50 reportedly refuse to return to the campus out of fear for 
their safety 
they were among about 140 mostly african students who were forced 
to the guest house after police blocked their attempt to board 
trains for beijing they were fleeing thousands of chinese youths 
who ransacked their dormitory and staged street rallies demanding 
punishment for africans involved in a dec 24 fight in which 11 
chinese and two africans were injured 
a student from ghana was arrested saturday in a confrontation at 
the guest house in which africans claim police beat and tortured 
them with electric batons three other students have been detained 
for questioning 
a diplomat from the ghana embassy in beijing said on wednesday 
that the foreign ministry had denied everything related to 
police brutality 
ministercounsellor yn oheneakrasi said a group of about nine 
african diplomats who met with the africans in nanking last week 
planned to return on friday to confer with the students 
oheneakrasi said the outbreak of racial strife in other chinese 
cities gives us concern we are following these events very 
keenly 
the two foreigners who described the disturbance saturday at the 
central china polytechnical college in wuhan a student from gabon 
and an american teacher said school authorities took the colleges 
12 african students on a trip to the countryside on sunday and they 
have yet to return 
the student and teacher spoke on condition of anonymity 
the gabonese student said chinese students at the college wrote a 
letter to the school director saying they didnt want africans at 
the school because they were polluting chinese society with their 
relations with chinese women 
in the city of hangzhou an african student at the zhejiang 
agricultural college said the africans boycotting classes in the 
aids protest met school officials wednesday who promised to give 
them a written statement saying the university had no official 
policy of discrimination against africans 
the student vincent ongas of kenya said that once the 
statement is received the africans would consider whether to end the 
boycott it was a tough meeting as you know were not quite a 
happy group in china he said 
the chinese side denies all charges of racial prejudice and 
expresses pride at its longestablished policy of showing solidarity 
with the third world by giving scholarships to african students 
there are about 1500 african students from 40 nations now in china 
however africans say they are subject to racial discrimination 
and social contacts between african men and chinese women are a 
frequent source of tension 
chinese also resent that africans many from countries as poor as 
china receive far better food and lodging than chinese students

leader lech walesa published in the jan 7 edition of the communist 
party weekly polityka 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the government can say that solidarity means the struggle 
against the authorities or the threat of anarchy and it is right 
somebody else will say that it is the struggle for reform and he is 
also right for me it is the struggle for making the authorities 
undertake reforms carried on at various places not en masse as it 
once used to be but through various associations clubs economic 
movements and its main unionist stream 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the international situation is much better now important 
transformations are taking place in other countries especially in 
the soviet union i talked about this with professor andrei sakharov 
in paris they also understand in moscow that it is necessary to 
depart from the stalinist system to break with it the totalitarian 
structure must be replaced by pluralism 
we also could hear a similar opinion voiced from the highest 
rostrum in poland recently this raises our hopes that reformatory 
forces will prevail in the governing camp solidarity keeps 
repeating that it is ready to sign an anticrisis pact in favor of 
reform 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the authorities have seen that without agreement nothing can be 
done in the country and society has also learned that without the 
authorities one cannot go far 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i state once again in this country agreement is necessary the 
legalization of solidarity is the key matter there is nothing to be 
afraid of i repeat we do not want to overthrow the authorities 
compromise lies in our common interest together we have to do 
something for poland the interest of poland is the order of the 
day this is the supreme matter and this is why we must reach 
agreement 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
you are saying that there is at threat of destabilization if the 
authorities legalize the union the authorities shall grant the 
union whether they want to or not only will it be by force or 
without and what will be the costs for me this is the question 
and tanks wont help here because they did not once already 
poland needs quick agreement 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
guarantees i reassure we are not a threat to this authority 
this apparatus we dont have any other party or group which could 
take over power and the party has lots of time to situate itself on 
this evolutionary path however it is threatened by a revolutionary 
path and thats why if it does not come to terms with us if we 
together dont find a place for it the party and for us then this 
would be dangerous both for the party and maybe for us as well it 
is better to come to terms now peacefully rather than after 
fighting there is more to be gained and it will be easier for the 
party to rule when it is clearly aware of its place in poland there 
must be place for everybody the sooner the party comes to terms 
with us the better a new solution by force we dont want to 
become afghanistan i will say what i said in 1981 lets meet on 
the road to reforms because there is no other way out 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
i evaluate this meeting tv debate nov 30 with the head of the 
official union federation alfred miodowicz very well but not from 
the point of view of a battle or victory it must result in 
something the stagnation which has existed in poland must end since 
we all are losing because of it this debate was like a breeze 
in our inertia we have caught some wind in our sails

president reagan was awakened about an hour 
after wednesdays downing of two libyan jet fighters by us navy 
planes over the mediterranean sea in contrast to a similar incident 
in 1981 when he was not told for more than six hours 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said that lt gen colin l 
powell the presidents national security adviser telephoned the 
president at the home in the fashionable bel air district of los 
angeles where reagan will live after his term ends jan 20 
the president and first lady nancy reagan have been staying at 
the home during most of a twoweek california vacation which they 
will wind up on thursday returning to washington for their final 
two weeks in the white house 
popadiuk said powell telephoned white house chief of staff 
kenneth m duberstein before informing the president of the shooting 
at 253 am pst 
he said he had no information on the presidents reaction except 
to say the president considers the incident closed 
in the earlier incident in august 1981 seven months after reagan 
took office his aides were sharply criticized for allowing him to 
sleep after they knew of the downing of two libyan planes 
in both incidents two libyan aircraft were downed by us f14s 
in the 1981 case reagan was also in los angeles staying in a 
750aday suite at the century plaza hotel at that time he went 
six hours and four minutes without knowing of the shooting 
deputy white house press secretary larry speakes said 
presidential counselor edwin meese iii and national security adviser 
richard v allen both in los angeles with the presidential party 
were informed almost immediately 
that incident the first since the vietnam war in which us 
planes fired on foreign planes occurred at 1020 pm pdt meese 
telephoned reagan at 424 am pdt speakes said they spoke for 
four or five minutes and the president went back to sleep he added 
popadiuk said he did not know whether reagan went back to sleep 
after being told of wednesdays shooting he also said powell kept 
in touch with the president by telephone during the day bringing 
him up to date on developments 
in 1981 speakes said meese decided not to inform the president 
after conferring with secretary of defense caspar weinberger he 
said meese felt that no decisions were necessary and he wanted to 
await a more complete report before disturbing the president 
speakes said the president did not object to not having been 
awakened earlier others informed before the president included 
secretary of state alexander m haig jr in santa barbara calif 
vice president george bush in maine and cia director william casey 
in washington 
speakes said reagans aides decided that only two decisions were 
necessary and that they had been made shortly after the incident 
one was whether to continue the training exercises which the 
fleet commander had decided to do and the other was whether the 
aircraft pilots should return fire which they had already done 
in wednesdays case also officials announced that the training 
exercise would continue

a top us diplomat said tuesday the united 
states hopes a paris conference on chemical weapons will expand the 
power of the united nations to investigate allegations of use of the 
illegal arms 
we would like chemical weapons never to be used and we would 
like countries like libya not to be producing them said 
ambassador herbert s okun deputy permanent representative 
our goal will be to enhance the role of the secretarygeneral 
to investigate promptly allegations of the use of these chemical 
weapons and to report back to the international community so they 
can do something about it said okun the no 2 us diplomat at 
the united nations 
okun in an interview with the associated press commented on an 
international conference on chemical weapons starting saturday in 
paris which will discuss what he called the poor countries 
atomic bomb 
the meeting was proposed last fall by president reagan and french 
president francois mitterrand to curb the use and production of 
chemical weapons and to strengthen international opposition to the 
arms 
the weapons already are outlawed by the geneva protocol of 1925 
but it has been violated widely by some developing nations 
the conference will be attended by about 140 nations and 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
okun declined to discuss possible sanctions such as a trade 
embargo for confirmed use of the weapons saying that was premature 
the un general assembly and security council have condemned the 
use of chemical weapons in general and in the iraniraq war last 
summer a un report cited iraqs widespread use of the weapons 
allegedly against its dissident kurdish minority iraq denied it and 
refused access to international investigators 
sometimes diplomats have said political considerations have 
prevented the world body from promptly expressing outrage and 
condemnation of a particular country last year when the security 
council wanted to bring iraq to the bargaining table to try to end 
its war with iran some nations were reluctant to publicly condemn 
iraq lest it refuse to talk 
okun said the us goal at the conference is to heighten 
consciousness about the use of chemical weapons 
asked about us charges that libya is about to produce chemical 
weapons at a purported pesticide plant okun said plans for the 
conference preceded the libyan situation 
it is not directly aimed at libya iraq or anbody else he 
said 
he emphasized that un investigation of alleged chemical weapon 
use was one thing and the production side is another question 
but clearly a heavily defended libyan plant that is producing 
only pesticides in libya allows us to assume the worst we have to 
assume that its a separate issue but we take it very seriously 
he said 
asked against whom the libyan plant would have to be defended 
okun said he didnt know but added if their motives are not 
good they probably would have to fear a lot of people

two sikhs convicted in the 1984 
assassination of prime minister indira gandhi are to be hanged 
friday relatives of the condemned men and a government official 
said wednesday 
todays date is the blackest date for me not because my 
fathers execution date has been fixed but because an innocent man 
has lost all hopes of mercy and justice said rajinder singh the 
son of one of the men my father was and is innocent 
he said his mother and brother were informed of the execution 
date when they visited new delhis tihar jail on wednesday 
his father kehar singh 54 and satwant singh 24 have been at 
the prison since their arrest in november 1984 the men are not 
related all sikhs take the name singh which means lion in the 
punjabi language 
an official at the home ministry confirmed the hanging was 
scheduled friday but said it was open to change 
we have to wait for the supreme courts decision on thursday 
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the condemned who are not related have filed appeals before the 
court that are scheduled to be heard thursday 
it is the second time their execution has been set the supreme 
court stayed the hanging 15 hours before it was scheduled dec 2 
after kehar singhs lawyers challenged the dismissal of his mercy 
petition to president ramaswamy venkataraman 
satwant singh did not filed a mercy petition legally the final 
avenue for a person condemned to die but under indian law his 
death sentence was automatically delayed when kehar singh sought 
clemency 
venkataraman turned down the mercy plea monday clearing the way 
for the executions 
on thursday the supreme court will hear kehar singhs appeal of 
the presidents dismissal of his mercy petition the court also will 
hear satwant singhs request that it investigate his allegations of 
murder against two of mrs gandhis bodyguards 
mrs gandhi was shot in the garden of her new delhi residence on 
oct 31 1984 by two sikhs 
one of them beant singh was shot and killed by two bodyguards 
minutes later the other satwant singh was shot and wounded 
satwant singh has alleged the bodyguards fired at him and beant 
singh after they were disarmed a magistrates court and an appeals 
court have already rejected his pleas to investigate the case 
kehar singh an uncle of beant singh was convicted of conspiracy 
mrs gandhis assassination was in apparent revenge for an army 
raid she had ordered four months previously on the golden temple in 
amritsar the holiest sikh shrine to rid the complex of sikh 
militants 
more than 1200 people most of them sikhs died in the raid 
sikh militants are fighting for a separate nation in punjab 
state where they are a majority throughout india however sikhs 
are a minority and claim discrimination by the hindu majority

mahdi said wednesday the government was working on economic and 
political reforms severe shortages of bread and gasoline continued 
across the country and newspapers reported student protests in two 
western towns 
officials said wednesday 130000 tons of wheat and flour from 
turkey saudi arabia and the netherlands had arrived in port sudan 
on the red sea and would be used to relieve the bread shortage 
bread when available has increased in price from the equivalent of 
about 1 cents to nearly 23 cents 
in an interview with the associated press mahdi blamed the riots 
on dramatic price increases for basic goods which were rescinded 
immediately he asserted that his 3yearold government was in 
control and had the support of most sudanese 
i have no doubt that if it comes to street support the 
government will have greater support than any combination of its 
enemies mahdi declared 
he added however i think troublemakers will try to work up 
something on the streets the provocative procedures if some 
insist on them will be neutralized ultimately if it is a 
question of street action i think it will be defeated 
the prime minister conducted the interview in his downtown 
offices wearing the traditional sudanese white flowing robe and 
turban 
protesters stormed the offices on dec 29 smashing government 
cars and shouting for mahdis resignation but police dispersed them 
with tear gas and water cannon before they reached the premier 
riots began after the government decreed price increases of 600 
percent for sugar and 60 percent for cigarettes and a 15 percent tax 
on domestically manufactured goods wages were raised by up to 500 
percent two days earlier and the government said the new revenues 
were intended to pay for them 
i think the main cause of the demonstrations is the extent of 
the changes that have taken place without necessary preparations 
mahdi said and he was discussing with trade unions how to finance 
the higher wages 
he said revenue must be found and we are discussing these 
sources there will be more negotiations on all fronts 
asked about possible peace talks with the sudan peoples 
liberation army in the south mahdi said he would send defense 
minister abdulmaguid hamed khalil to meet with the rebel leader 
former army col john garang 
if they are interested in peace they will have to meet with 
the party against whom theyre fighting he said 
no date has been set for khalils departure garang has said he 
will speak only with someone who brings government endorsement of a 
peace proposal he signed in november with the democratic unionist 
party then a member of mahdis governing alliance 
the democratic unionists left the coalition after mahdi refused 
to accept the terms many political observers say he rejected the 
agreement to placate the fundamentalist national islamic front a 
buffer in the cabinet between his umma party and the unionists 
what the front opposes is a provision to suspend the 
1350yearold islamic legal code in sudan which the rebels in the 
predominantly christian and animist south consider a necessity 
garangs army seeks greater autonomy for the the south from the 
moslem north of africas largest country 
mahdi said he wants peace but what is under review are the 
unacceptable aspects of the agreement 
speaking of famine and disease in the south which western 
officials say killed at least 560000 people in 1988 mahdi said 
hope can be found in the food airlift being conducted by the 
international committee of the red cross 
he said the airlift agreed upon by the government and rebels 
has had a peaceful effect 
relief efforts had been stalled by rebel threats to attack 
convoys moving without permission whether from the government or 
international organizations the government refused to cooperate 
with international agencies dealing with the rebels

joyce mays former nail biter got her first 
manicure 20 years ago to enhance the beauty of the big topaz ring 
her husband gave her 
twenty years later mays fingernails are her most prized 
posession each fiveinchlong twisting brightly painted one of 
them 
now she uses the nails to draw the customers from among the 
curious who gather at the window of the finesse hair designers salon 
and watch her give manicures 
people stare at my nails said mays 43 when they do it 
doesnt bother me i try to get closer and give them one of my 
business cards 
it has been three years since she cut her nails which she paints 
with acrylics changing the designs about every three weeks 
to protect them she never uses them in mundane tasks like 
dialing telephones instead her knuckles get a lot of wear and tear 
she also cant change the sheets on the bed for that she 
enlists the aid of her husband bill 
when pope john paul ii visited new orleans last year she painted 
a picture of the pontiff hands clasped in prayer on one thumbnail 
on the other was a likeness of st louis cathedral blue sky in the

there are about 35000 babies just 
waiting to be born in louisiana officially speaking that is 
the babies are alive and kicking as far as their parents are 
concerned but they dont yet exist in state records thats because 
budget cuts have caused a threemonth backlog on the issuance of 
birth certificates in the state 
we are waiting for the paper to come in we expect it to come 
in in about a week said gwen bachstewart spokeswoman for the 
department of health and hospitals what we plan to do to get 
caught up is to print 6000 to 8000 a week to knock out the 
backlog 
when cashflow problems developed last year the department cut 
in half its order of paper used in printing birth certificates she 
said 
when the supply got low we had to order again bachstewart 
said but state purchasing procedures are lengthy and the paper ran 
out 
state law requires the office of vital statistics to send the 
parents of all newborns a free birth certificate normally about 
2000 of the certificates are sent each week 
once the new paper supplies arrive vital statistics will start 
sending the certificates out at an expedited rate assigning 
additional workers to the job until the backlog is erased 
bachstewart said 
it is going to be behind for a while if the public bears with 
us we should be back to normal in a short time she said

more than 1000 people have flocked 
to a suburban firewood yard since christmas eve sometimes standing 
vigil until dawn to see a glowing light and what some claim to be 
images of the virgin mary or jesus 
the reported appearance of the light amid logs and stacks of 
bundled firewood has drawn increasingly larger crowds each night to 
this predominantly black community a few miles northeast of houston 
to me its a blessing said pat reed 46 a homemaker in 
barrett station i keep coming back for more its the most 
wonderful thing thats ever happened i think it will help draw us 
together to serve god more 
the size of the crowds has prompted the harris county sheriffs 
department to offer assistance with crowd control as cars begin 
stacking up at dusk and hundreds file into the site 
joseph lemond 75 who runs the firewood yard with his son said 
he first saw the light on christmas eve when he went to check 
equipment in the yard 
photographs taken a few days later show a light radiating a 
brilliant blue beige and white diamondshaped image but lemond 
said the image is much clearer and more vivid when ive seen it 
than it appears in the blurred photos 
after new years eve he said the blue light faded to a golden 
white in which some spectators reported seeing a vision of jesus 
with a thorned crown along with occasional glimpses of the virgin 
i feel the light is pretty miraculous lemond said 
the light reflects off an overturned white table lying near a 
shed at the back of the cluttered lot 
everything has been like this for five years said lemonds 
son martin weve come out here at night and never seen it 
before 
last weekend the family showed it to some neighbors and to a 
roman catholic priest the rev donald fest 
i saw the blueandwhite configuration said fest who viewed 
the light new years eve its possible that its supernatural 
but im not an expert i cant explain it i call it a curious 
phenomenon

a sheriffs deputy on her second night of duty was 
fatally shot at a jail early today by an inmate released hours 
earlier authorities said 
suzanne kays 33 was shot several times with her own gun at the 
lew sterrett criminal justice center after the rookie tried to stop 
37yearold alfonso seward from entering an area off limits to the 
public officials said 
kays who had been named the top graduate in her class at the 
training academy was pronounced dead at parkland memorial hospital 
seward was shot several times by police officers after the 
slaying said sheriff jim bowles he was listed in serious condition 
it was the first slaying at a dallas jail since jack ruby shot 
lee harvey oswald on nov 24 1963 in the basement of the dallas 
city jail authorities said oswald had been arrested in the 
assassination of president kennedy 
todays shooting was the first slaying of a law officer in dallas 
in 1989 five police officers were killed in 1988 the deadliest 
year in department history 
seward who had been arrested five times since nov 9 on 
misdemeanor charges had been jailed monday for failing to pay for a 
restaurant meal and was released tuesday evening less than eight 
hours before the shooting 
sheriffs spokesman jim ewell said seward had stayed in the lobby 
for a couple of hours after being freed bowles said the man tried 
to enter a secure area 
there was an altercation and he assassinated her the sheriff 
said 
after the shooting the man waved the deputys pistol at clerks 
and a janitor and fired a shot in a corridor bowles said two 
police officers with shotguns demanded his surrender but he refused 
and was shot in the lower body the sheriff said 
kays was described as a model officer and had worked for the 
county as a detention officer since 1981 any time an officer is 
slain its terrible said sheriffs lt james cron but when 
its one of her caliber its a real loss 
kays who was single and had served from army from 1975 to 1979 
she joined the department in 1981 starting as a detention service 
officer 
she was the only female in the training class that graduated 
thursday and was awarded a wristwatch as the top student in 
academics and firearms efficiency as a detention officer she had 
not been allowed to carry a weapon 
kays was the first dallas county law enforcement officer since 
1982 to die in the line of duty 
bowles said he will order a review of security at the jail

a farm couple who have bitterly fought 
foreclosure were released from jail wednesday after being charged in 
an incident in which they refused to obey an eviction notice and 
were carried out of their home by sheriffs deputies 
herman gennrich was charged with trespassing and his wife 
beverly gennrich was charged with trespassing and obstructing the 
legal process both misdemeanors said carver county attorney mike 
fahey 
a condition of their release is that they not return to their 
farm without permission from the court fahey said if they do 
theyll probably be arrested again for trespassing 
the couple were removed from their home near cologne on tuesday 
authorities using trucks and trailers then removed their 
belongings machinery and livestock 
sheriffs captain ed hjermstad said the gennrichs were carried

couples farm about 40 miles southwest of minneapolis fahey said 
tuesday 
the couple were told to be off the 320acre farm by nov 4 but 
they had until dec 31 to match the banks offer on their property 
which they failed to do fahey said 
the gennrichs land was auctioned in may 1987 but the family was 
allowed to farm the land for one year under a grace period 
provision the farm was purchased by farm credit services for 
405000 
the gennrichs are to appear in court again jan 11 fahey said 
in june 1987 gennrich and his son robert who owns an adjoining 
farm pleaded guilty to charges that they resisted attempts by 
authorities to repossess equipment and livestock in february of that 
year authorities said the father and son bashed a trailer and 
brandished firearms when creditors tried to repossess the equipment

the electoral college a 200yearold political 
oddity has once again elected a president and vice president of the 
united states 
the electoral votes were carried by bluecoated pages into a 
joint session of congress at 1 pm wednesday in a pair of large 
brassbound mahogany boxes secured with stout leather straps 
the straps were unfastened padlocks were unlocked and tellers 
two from the senate and two from the house slit open the sealed 
manila envelopes stored inside and read the official results state 
by state by state 
born of compromise in the constitutional convention of 1787 the 
electoral college first saw service in the nations first 
presidential election in 1789 deciding that the voters were right 
in selecting george washington as president and john adams as vice 
president 
in theory the electoral college could have arrived at a 
different result entirely in 1789 
and again in theory the outcome now could be entirely different 
than that called for by the voters george bush for president and 
dan quayle as vice president 
indeed the result bush announced 426 electoral votes for bush 
111 votes for democrat michael dukakis and one vote for sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas is one vote off the result dictated by voters 
when the electoral votes originally were counted in state 
capitals one elector margarette leach of west virginia cast her 
presidential vote for sen lloyd bentsen dtexas and her vice 
presidential vote for dukakis 
why did she do that 
i wanted to make a statement about the electoral college she 
said weve outgrown it and i wanted to point up what i see as a 
weakness in the system that 270 people can get together in this 
country and elect a president whether hes on the ballot or not in 
most states electors can do whatever they want if youre over 35 
and a citizen 
on wednesday bush became the first sitting vice president since 
martin van buren in 1837 to announce his own election as president 
bush shook hands with dozens of house members as he entered the 
house chamber in a procession in which the boxes containing the 
electoral ballots came first bush came next and members of the 
senate brought up the rear 
early in the counting process rep frank annunzio dill a 
teller appointed by the house forgot to give the names of the 
winners declaring only that arkansas casts six votes for 
president and six votes for vice president 
who who who the audience of lawmakers chanted 
bush got off a quip 
the chair wonders who won that he said 
the house chamber burst into applause 
its obvious they all know the answer to that bush said 
displaying a happy grin 
there were few other slips although annunzio repeatedly declared 
that he was announcing electorial votes 
at least one grumble was heard after bush announced the results 
rep frank mccloskey dind said he believed the electoral system 
should be scrapped and replaced with a direct popular vote he 
predicted that might well be done at some point where a president 
is elected by a minority 
the electoral college sprang from disagreement inside the 
constitutional convention over how a president should be elected 
direct popular election was opposed by delegates who feared that 
most people would not know enough about the candidates to make a 
wise choice other objections were raised to proposals that congress 
select the president or that state legislatures do it 
a committee was appointed and it hammered together a solution 
each state would appoint presidential electors equal to the total 
number of its senators and representatives in congress 
in present day terms that comes to 435 members of the house of 
representatives and 100 members of the senate plus three electoral 
votes for the district of columbia 
on election day the voters of each state actually choose 
electors pledged to the candidate of their choice and selected by 
state party organizations 
to win election a presidential candidate must receive 270 
electoral votes an absolute majority 
if no candidate scores that high the winner is picked by the 
house of representatives from the three top vote getters in that 
process each state delegation casts just one vote 
if no vice presidential candidate gets a majority the victor is 
chosen by the senate from the top two

the mayor of the west bank town of bethlehem 
who proposed a truce in the palestinian uprising appeared to be in 
hiding wednesday after a warning from yasser arafat and death 
threats painted on the town walls 
the jerusalem post on tuesday quoted mayor elias freij as saying 
he had withdrawn the truce idea 
freij said friday that during a recent visit to romania he 
raised the possibility of a unsponsored truce in the yearold 
palestinian uprising 
he said he proposed conditions under which israel would free 
5000 palestinian prisoners allow universities to open and hold 
municipal elections for the first time in 12 years 
i spoke about a unsponsored resolution like the one that 
stopped the iraniraq war he said in an interview with the 
associated press he said he asked romanias president nicolae 
ceaucescu to pass on the idea to arafat 
since it began more than a year ago 346 arabs and 14 jews have 
been killed in the uprising or intefadeh 
arafat in remarks broadcast monday said no one can stop the 
intefadeh and any responsible palestinian calling for stopping it 
exposes himself to the bullets of our people 
the plo leaders comments were carried by the frenchrun monte 
carlo radio station which has a large middle east audience 
threats appeared on walls in bethlehem including shame on 
freij and death to the betrayers they were were written in 
red paint and signed by the popular front for the liberation of 
palestine 
one slogan signed by the front said freij would share the same 
fate as zafer al masri a projordanian assassinated march 2 1986 
after being named mayor of the west bank city of nablus 
al masri was appointed with israels approval and amid 
speculation he would play a role in a peace dialogue the pflp 
claimed responsibility for his slaying 
freij a christian who has close ties with jordan was quoted by 
the englishlanguage jerusalem post as saying he was abandoning his 
truce idea because of plo opposition 
it is not up to me to make a decision it is the plo our sole 
and legitimate representative which makes the decision i will 
not pursue my proposal for a truce any further freij was quoted 
as saying 
telephone calls to freijs office went unanswered and his home 
telephone was out of order 
jamal salman secretary of the city council told a reporter he 
did not know where the mayor was and knew nothing of his reaction to 
arafats statement 
a reporter who went to freijs home was turned away by a member 
of the freij family the relative said the mayor was not at home 
after first going inside to see if freij was available 
hanna siniora editor of the daily al fajr newspaper said he did 
not believe arafat had meant to threaten freij or other moderates 
i feel the intention of arafat was to say that the intefadeh 
was the most effective tool the palestinians have to try to end the 
occupation and create coxeistence between two states palestine and 
israel siniora said in a telephone interview

shiite moslem militias fought mortar 
battles in south lebanon on wednesday while in beiruts southern 
slums syrian troops moved to separate the warring factions 
police said 10 fighters were wounded in artillery duels between 
the prosyrian amal and the iranianbacked hezbollah in the southern 
iklim eltiffah near israels security zone 
the casualties raised the toll from five straight days of clashes 
to 29 dead and 76 wounded 
amal accused hezbollah of shelling its forces from positions in 
the deserted jbaa ein bouswar jarjou arab saleem and louwaizeh 
villages on the northwestern edge of the security zone a six to 
10milewide strip of land israel established in 1985 after 
withdrawing the bulk of its troops from lebanon 
we had to respond in order to silence the sources of fire 
said an amal spokesman who refused to be identified we are 
determined to end hezbollahs provocative acts in the south once and 
for all 
amal arabic for hope and hezbollah or party of god are 
struggling for dominance of lebanons 1 million shiites the 
countrys largest sect 
a police spokesman who cannot be identified under standing 
regulations described the situation in south lebanon as more 
delicate than in south beirut 
the two factions are heading toward a showdown and the syrians 
are not there to control the situation at the last minute he said 
syria the main power broker in lebanon keeps 25000 soldiers in 
eastern and northern lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from 
the arab league it has no troops in south lebanon near the security 
zone 
in the slums of south beirut the syrians have 4500 troops who 
were deployed in may to halt a threeweek bloodbath between amal and 
hezbollah 
the police spokesman said syrian troops armed with automatic 
rifles and rocketpropelled grenade launchers manned buffer zones 
to separate fighters in south beirut 
he called the syrian move another shot of tranquilizers and 
said the clashes would start again as long as the syrians do not 
crack down on either side 
some south beirut residents said they were convinced more 
fighting would erupt and left 
they the militias still have plenty of weapons and 
ammunition they will fight again said umm mohammed a harat 
hreik district resident who said she had moved in with her daughter 
in west beirut 
ill only return to south beirut when either of the two 
factions smashes the other or when the syrians disarm both groups 
she said 
a syrian military source said his command had no plans to do that 
we talk to both sides convince them of certain measures and 
deploy on the ground to implement these measures there is no 
decision to crack down on either side said the source who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the shiites mufti or religious judge called for disarming both 
militias saying their weapons have become tools for killing 
children and other innocent people 
no one should be allowed to possess weapons in south beirut 
except the syrian forces sheik abul amir qabalan said in a 
statement broadcast on lebanese radio

defense secretary frank c carlucci has 
approved the recommendation of a special commission to close dozens 
of military bases across the country setting the stage for a final 
debate on capitol hill pentagon officials said wednesday 
the officials who insisted on anonymity said carluccis 
decision was hardly unexpected and would be announced by the 
defense secretary at a press conference on thursday 
carlucci has been a strong backer of efforts to close unneeded or 
obsolete military bases and strongly advocated the law passed last 
year that created the special government commission 
under that law since carlucci has now endorsed the panels 
recommendations congress must either accept or reject the list of 
bases proposed for closure in its entirety it cannot pick and 
choose or bargain over the fate of individual bases on the list 
the commission has recommended actions affecting 145 military 
facilities including 34 bases that would be closed outright 
the defense department declined to discuss carluccis decision on 
wednesday beyond saying he had scheduled a press conference and 
will send to congress his decision regarding the recommendations 
on thursday 
carlucci could have taken until jan 15 to make up his mind if he 
wished 
the commission known formally as the base realignment and 
closure commission has recommended that 34 military installations 
and 52 military housing complexes be closed completely that five 
other installations be partially closed and that 54 others get new 
missions or additional personnel 
all told the panel has estimated the actions would produce 
savings of 693 million a year 
while that is not an inconsiderable sum it represents only a 
small part of the nations spending on defense the pentagons 
budget this year totals 2995 billion nonetheless congressional 
leaders also have predicted the closing list will be approved 
my general feeling is that this will be well received by the 
congress sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed 
services committee said after the list was unveiled 
he said the odds are heavily in favor of the recommendations 
taking effect 
the largest affected bases are five air force bases chanute in 
illinois george mather and norton in california and pease in new 
hampshire all recommended for closing and three army 
installations the army bases include fort dix in new jersey to 
partially close and fort sheridan in illinois and the presidio in 
downtown san francisco to close completely 
the philadelphia naval hospital also would be closed completed 
other important bases that would be affected are fort meade md to 
partially close and the jefferson proving ground in indiana to 
close 
the pentagon has not shut down a major installation since 1977 
mainly because of pressure from members of congress with major bases 
in their districts 
the closing process created last year requires the commissions 
entire package of proposals to be either accepted or rejected 
precisely with the idea of overcoming that political pressure from 
congressmen trying to protect local bases

a private research institute that 
monitors the world arms trade says libya probably has joined at 
least nine other nations that possess or plan to acquire chemical 
weapons 
the organization the stockholm international peace research 
institute also says however that an accurate and certain count of 
countries posssessing such weapons is clouded by disinformation and 
vested interests 
at one time or another 38 countries were reported to have 
chemical weapons but the reports often were unreliable or hard to 
assess the institute said in its 1988 yearbook which was published 
in august 
johan lundin an institute researcher said in an interview 
wednesday its hard to put a figure on it a few countries have 
declared they have chemical weapons others say they intend to have 
them and there are a lot of allegations against other countries we 
have no information of our own 
the institute is a private research institute partially funded by 
the swedish government it was set up to monitor the world arms 
trade and developments in disarmament mainly through published 
reports 
the organization said in the 1988 yearbook that responsible us 
and other government officials speaking on the record listed nine 
countries as having chemical weapons or intending to acquire them 
france iraq north korea syria the united states the soviet 
union afghanistan iran and vietnam 
since the books publication the united states has accused libya 
of having a weaponsproducing capability libya denies it 
lundin said the us allegation about libyas capability was as 
reliable as those on which the previous count of nine nations was 
based 
the institute said other countries have been named in less 
reliable reports a purported 1983 us intelligence document leaked 
to the british broadcasting corp added the names of burma china 
egypt ethiopia israel libya and taiwan as possessors 
last year iran and iraq were reported to have used toxic gases 
combatants in angola mozambique and afghanistan also made 
unsubstantiated allegations that they were victims of chemical 
warfare lundin said 
in 1987 libya was accused of using lethal gas in chad and 
vietnam was charged with poisoning water supplies in cambodia and 
the institutes yearbook said chemical weapons were used in the 
iraniraq war 
the previous year charges of chemical war were raised against 
ethiopia iraq iran the soviet union vietnam angola chad libya 
and nicaragua sipri reported without elaborating

the florida supreme court has agreed to hear oral 
arguments in an appeal by a migrant farm worker imprisoned for 20 
years in the pesticide poisoning deaths of his seven children the 
mans attorney said wednesday 
attorney ellis rubin called the move a significant step on a 
possible road to freedom for james richardson a black man 
convicted by an allwhite jury of one count of firstdegree murder 
in a daughters death 
attorneys for richardson have obtained affidavits from two 
nursing home aides who say the childrens babysitter later deemed 
mentally incompetent has confessed to poisoning the childrens 
fatal lunch and from a former arcadia police chief charging that an 
exsheriff framed richardson 
rubin had filed a writ with the supreme court asking for 
permission to return to the trial court to argue that perjured 
testimony was knowingly presented by the prosecution the state 
suppressed evidence and new evidence has been discovered 
i will urge the court to grant us permission to go back to the 
trial court in fort myers and seek a new trial rubin said 
richardson whose death penalty was commuted to life by the us 
supreme court in 1972 also is seeking clemency from the governor 
whose office is investigating both the criminal case and allegations 
of prosecutorial wrongdoing 
the prosecution argued at trial that richardson killed his 
children to collect on a life insurance policy signed the night 
before the children ate their parathionlaced meal oct 25 1967 
but rubin contends the prosecution withheld from evidence an 
insurance agents card showing the policy was only an offer at the 
time of the mass killing

the california highway patrol booked a 
motorist for evading arrest and other charges following a long slow 
chase through four counties that never exceeded the speed limit a 
spokesman said wednesday 
the chp pursuit of a 1978 volkswagen sedan began near malibu at 
about 645 pm tuesday and ended more than four hours and almost 
200 miles later in san diego county officer cliff williams said 
his vehicle ran out of gas thats why he stopped williams 
said 
the driver brett t barish 29 of la jolla was booked on 
charges of failure to yield to a peace officer driving while 
intoxicated driving without a valid license and seven miscellaneous 
warrants williams said 
the chase began when officer donna urqidi tried to stop the 
volkswagen for driving very slowly while northbound on malibu canyon 
road about 30 miles west of downtown los angeles 
the car stopped williams said but as urqidi approached the car 
it pulled away as urqidi watched the car turned eastbound on 
mulholland drive going 35 mph 
reviewing the report that summarized the ensuing chase williams 
said ive got six pages of where this vehicle traversed it went 
mulholland past cold canyon past stunt road past turtle creek 
lets see then it turned onto northbound topanga at 40 mph 
within 15 minutes a los angeles police helicopter chattered 
overhead and for the next four hours at least two chp patrol cars 
pursued the car sirens screaming and lights flashing as it wended 
its way through los angeles riverside orange and san diego 
counties 
at 718 pm the fleeing car was reported eastbound on state 
route 134 at 55 mph at 724 pm it was southbound on interstate 5 
at 55 mph 
the chp never really considered trying to force the car off the 
road williams said 
ramming a vehicle could lead to more serious consequences 
williams said explaining the danger to other vehicles on the 
freeway the only time we try to force someone off the road is if 
theyre doing something dangerous that represents a threat to public 
safety 
the car turned southbound on interstate 215 then turned onto 
state route 91 and followed that highway into san diego county 
the pursuit ended at 1050 pm in the northbound lanes of 
interstate 15 
its unusual when people attempt to evade whether its fast or 
slow williams said but whenever they do evade us we make 
every attempt to make the stop

researchers say they may have observed an 
astronomical oddity a remnant of a supernova star explosion within 
the remains of another supernova 
if they are right a star may have exploded less than 800 years 
ago inside the expanding shell of material from another stars 
explosion about 4000 years ago 
this is a speculative interpretation of the data cautioned 
pf winkler of middlebury college in vermont one of the 
researchers reporting the evidence 
im not persuaded by it said robert fesen of the university 
of colorado in boulder who was familiar with the work 
fesen said it is highly unlikely that two neighboring stars would 
explode at what astronomers consider virtually the same time nobody 
has reported such a double supernova elsewhere he said 
the new work is reported in thursdays issue of the british 
journal nature it was written by winkler along with scientists at 
the harvardsmithsonian center for astrophysics and the cerro tololo 
interamerican observatory in chile 
at that observatory in february they studied a collection of 
intertwined filaments near the center of the puppis a supernova 
remnant 
analysis showed the filaments were made of different elements 
including oxygen and sulfur that could be ejected by an exploding 
star the appearance of the filaments was consistent with their 
being a supernova remnant and their speed approached that seen in 
material ejected from a supernova winkler said 
although other supernova remnants give off xrays and radio 
waves none was observed from the filaments winkler said that 
suggests the filaments could be within the shell of the older 
supernova where the highpressure lowdensity environment would 
prevent the emissions 
perhaps the double supernova resulted from explosions of two 
similar stars that were orbiting each other he said 
fesen said he believes the filaments came from the original 
supernova explosion and that they are a curious feature that 
should be explained in some way

opponents in a legal battle between 
dartmouth college and two suspended student journalists drew 
opposite messages wednesday from a judges ruling that the two must 
be reinstated to the college 
in a decision released late tuesday grafton county superior 
court judge bruce mohl ordered the ivy league school to reinstate 
christopher baldwin and john sutter former editors of the 
conservative offcampus magazine dartmouth review the two were 
suspended after a classroom confrontation with a black professor 
mohl found the schools disciplinary panel and the 18month 
suspensions it imposed in march tainted by the participation of a 
professor who four months earlier signed a letter criticizing the 
dartmouth review as racist and sexist 
im happy as a pig in mud said baldwin 21 of hinsdale 
ill reached at the national review a conservative political 
magazine in new york where he has been working 
i just want to go back and have a smooth and uneventful senior 
year at dartmouth he said i just want to put this behind me 
he and sutter 22 of st louis are expected to return to campus 
thursday classes resumed at the school tuesday sutter also has 
been working as a journalist in new york 
their return wont end the matter lawsuits are pending in state 
and federal courts charging dartmouth with discriminating against 
conservatives 
a spokesman for the college claimed mohls ruling was a victory 
for the school because the judge found no persuasive evidence to 
support the students claim that they were brought up before the 
committee on standards because of their association with the review 
the disciplinary committee is made up of students faculty members 
and administrators 
the judge thus unequivocally rejected the students major claim 
that there was a bias against conservative students and students 
affiliated with the dartmouth review said the spokesman alex 
huppe 
any other reading of that would be a selfserving and 
misleading reading he said 
but harvey myerson one of the students lawyers said the judge 
did support the students contention when he said in another 
paragraph contrary to the colleges position the charges against 
the four students did arise directly out of their activities on the 
review 
mohl went on to note that the confrontation between music 
professor william cole and the students stemmed directly from their 
efforts to get his response to a review article criticizing him 
we dont think theres any question about it myerson said of 
whether the judge agreed the students were singled out for their 
review ties thats been a cornerstone of what weve been saying 
from the beginning 
baldwin sutter and two other review staffers clashed with cole 
after their magazine called one of coles courses one of 
dartmouths most academically deficient and denounced him for 
racist rantings one of the other students also was suspended 
but is already back on campus and the fourth served probation 
myerson also insisted the judge drew no meaningful distinction 
between the ninemember disciplinary panel whose chairman was the 
dean of the college and dartmouth itself 
obviously the court didnt draw that distinction myerson 
said the court found that the actions of the committee on 
standards were the actions of the college and ordered them the 
students reinstated 
he called the dean the righthand man to dartmouths 
president who he noted received the antireview letter signed by 
the biased disciplinary board member 
we felt from the beginning that the disciplinary process was 
really a sham process myerson said it looked clean it smelled 
clean but it was dirty the jury was stacked 
huppe disagreed saying mohl had affirmed the fundamental 
fairness of the disciplinary process

an elderly south texas weather prognosticator 
assures george bushs inaugural planners their worst nightmare a 
snowstorm wont come true to ruin the festivities surrounding 
bushs swearingin as president on jan 20 
this old gentleman from south texas sent me his almanac which 
said the period from jan 19 to jan 23 will have sunny warm and 
pleasant weather in washington dc said bobby holt general 
cochairman of the presidentelects inaugural committee 
holt a millionaire oil and gas tycoon and old friend of the vice 
president from midland texas told reporters wednesday he couldnt 
recall the amateur weathermans name and couldnt vouch for his 
accuracy 
im scared to call him and ask about his track record holt 
said with a nervous laugh he admitted the threat of a heavy storm 
during the inauguration was a constant worry 
the national weather service said it couldnt predict 
washingtons weather that far ahead except to say that average 
temperatures during the five days of inaugural events will range 
from 43 degrees to a low of 27 
one of the worst inaugural snowstorms in modern memory occurred 
the night before john f kennedy took the presidential oath in 1960 
the storm dumped eight inches of snow on washington halting all 
traffic and stranding guests trying to reach inaugural events 
army troops shoveled pennsylvania avenue clear of snowdrifts and 
by noon on jan 20 it was clear sunny and 22 degrees when a hatless 
kennedy took the oath on the east front steps of the capitol 
because of extreme cold in january 1985 president reagan moved 
his official swearingin for a second term from the west front of 
the capitol inside to the rotunda and the traditional inaugural 
parade down pennsylvania avenue to the white house was canceled

south korean government party officials 
on wednesday rejected a north korean proposal for unification talks 
involving political and religious leaders 
the party officials accused north korea of relying on a 
hackneyed propaganda aimed at causing unrest in south korea 
opposition party leaders described the north korean call as 
impractical or another political tactic out of impure motives 
on sunday north korean president kim il sung called for a 
political conference with south korean political and religious 
leaders to discuss reunification of the divided korean peninsula 
he invited to the proposed meeting in pyongyang south korean 
president roh taewoo leaders of three main opposition parties 
cardinal kim suhwan the top roman catholic leader in seoul and 
two dissident leaders mun ikhwan and paek kiwan 
kim il sung did not mention rohs repeated proposals for summit 
talks and invited him as head of the governing democratic justice 
party 
south korean government officials charged kim il sungs proposal 
was unfaithful and showed his intention not to recognize the roh 
government while dissident leaders reserved comment 
we believe the north is trying to dampen our positive 
initiative for a summit meeting and other channels of dialogue 
said a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
kim daejung who heads south koreas main opposition group said 
the north korean proposal was impractical he declined to elaborate 
rival opposition leader kim youngsam questioned the norths 
intention behind the proposal saying it appears to be aimed at 
causing division among south korean political parties 
the two koreas in recent months have traded fresh proposals for 
dialogue sports talks political and military talks on arms 
reductions and student talks in addition to ongoing parliamentary 
talks 
lawmakers from both countries held a series of talks last year 
with the latest meeting held dec 29 at the truce village of 
panmunjom 
such talks have been held on and off since the early 1970s but 
little progress has been made korea was divided north and south in 
1945 when soviet and us troops ended japans colonial rule at the 
end of world war ii

the united states is pleased with cuban 
president fidel castros announcement that he intends to release 225 
remaining prisoners his government has recognized as political the 
state departments spokesman said wednesday 
we welcome the announced release of the political prisoners 
particularly the remaining four longterm plantados all of whom 
have served more than 19 years in prison said spokesman charles 
e redman 
plantados are prisoners who refused on principle to 
participate in rehabilitation programs or in some cases to wear jail 
uniforms some have been jailed since the first years after the 1959 
revolution 
redman said castro has promised officials of the us catholic 
conference that he wil release the prisoners the conference has 
been pressing since 1985 for such action 
the washington post said wednesday the group of prisoners 
includes 44 persons havana has previously described as too dangerous 
to release from jail 
of the prisoners on the governments roster of those who have 
faced political charges about 250 were released during 1988 
the political prisoners the government has acknowledged include 
those named in a list of about 450 presented to cuba in may 1988 by 
cardinal john oconnor of new york the post said 
during the summer castro said that everyone on that list would 
be freed except the 44 he described as too dangerous

with the skirmish over the mediterranean 
serving as a backdrop the reagan administration readied an urgent 
appeal wednesday to industrialized nations to deny chemical weapons 
technology to libya and to approve economic penalties for poison gas 
users 
even before us jets shot down two libyan fighter planes near 
crete the reagan administration had served notsosubtle notice to 
the world that it considers moammar gadhafis drive to produce 
poison gas an allegation the libyan leader has consistently denied 
a serious threat to world stability 
in the wake of the clash defense secretary frank c carlucci and 
other senior us officials sought to separate the incident from the 
drumbeat of alarm the reagan administration has sounded for more 
than two months over the facility near the desert town of rabta 
about 40 miles south of tripoli 
the skirmish is bound to be centerstage at the chemical warfare 
conference that opens saturday in paris and yet william burns the 
us arms control director said it is not aimed at bashing a 
particular country 
referring to the us downing of two libyan jets burns told 
reporters at the state department i dont see it as really 
germane to the conference i think that other nations will not see 
it as germane as well 
he said the american delegation will focus on trying to 
strengthen the authority of united nations secretary general javier 
perez de cuellar to investigate allegations of chemical weapons use 
and to authorize the un general assembly or security council to 
impose sanctions on nations that challenge world order 
burns conceded however this could be difficult since all 
actions will be taken by consensus this means a single participant 
such as libya could hold off an overwhelming majority 
mindful of the us bombardment of the libyan capital in april 
1986 in which 37 persons including an adopted daughter of gadhafi 
perished a sense of foreboding enveloped the conference even before 
foreign ministers and ambassadors from more than 100 countries began 
to assemble in the french capital 
it is routine for the united states not to rule out any option 
including a military strike and yet when president reagan took 
this familiar stance last month the world took notice the downing 
of the two libyan jets on wednesday kept attention fastened on the 
libyan facility 
secretary of state george p shultz who flies to paris on 
thursday and will hold talks there through sunday will concentrate 
his efforts on the industrialized countries charles e redman the 
state department spokesman said the key was to deny gadhafi the 
equipment material and expertise to produce poison gas 
if these kind of things are going to be cut off its going to 
be very difficult for a plant of this kind to operate he said 
the 1925 international protocol under review in paris bans the 
use of chemical weapons but does not outlaw their production some 
20 nations by us estimate either have produced chemical weapons 
or are capable of manufacturing them 
the protocol has no enforcement mechanism its effectiveness 
depends on the selfdiscipline of the 130 nations that are parties 
to the pact 
at one time the civilized world abhorred poison gas but iraq 
which signed the 1925 agreement discovered in the persian gulf war 
that chemical weapons were effective against numerically superior 
iranian forces and some third world countries resent interference 
with their chemical industries 
to try to stem proliferation redman said we are prepared to 
discuss the strongest possible measures against countries that 
export chemical weapons technology 
the west european governments have responded with some skepticism 
to the us allegations against libya and its alleged suppliers 
however west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said 
wednesday his government had no evidence proving west german 
pharmaceutical firm had helped build the plant at rabta a spokesman 
for genscher said meanwhile bonn had accused washington for 
additional material to back up the allegation 
but the reagan administration has not pulled back 
robert m gates a former cia deputy director who was named last 
week as deputy director of the national security council said in a 
recent speech that the plant was built with the help of nearly a 
dozen nations east and west he declined to name them 
the united states stopped production of chemical weapons in 1969 
then resumed 17 years later on the grounds the soviet union and 
other potential adversaries had chemical weapons programs 
currently us chemical components and artillery shells to contain 
them are being produced but stockpiled separately 
the soviet union acknowledged in 1987 possession of chemical 
weapons then claimed to have ceased production a foreign ministry 
spokesman said 50000 tons would be stored the rest destroyed 
officials of the two countries have held nine sessions in geneva 
to plan ways to restrict proliferation 
so far the united states and the soviet union are the only two 
countries in the world to admit possessing chemical weapons

president reagan acknowledging recent human 
rights reforms in the soviet union agreed wednesday to us 
participation in a 1991 human rights conference in moscow 
the meeting was part of a threeconference schedule in europe 
approved by reagan 
the president decided to agree to this schedule including the 
moscow conference as a means of encouraging continuation of the 
significant progress in human rights that has taken place in the 
soviet union over the past three years deputy press secretary 
roman popadiuk told a briefing as regan vacationed in california 
britain quickly announced its concurrence in approving the 1991 
moscow conference paving the way for new eastwest negotiations to 
reduce conventional forces in europe 
britain and the united states had taken the toughest line on 
moscows ambition to host a human rights conference and wednesdays 
announcement opened the way to wrapping up 35nation talks between 
east and west in vienna due to end this month 
the ending of the current conference on security and cooperation 
in europe talks in vienna is a prerequisite for starting new 
eastwest negotiations on reducing conventional weapons and troops 
in europe 
popadiuk said reagans decision was prompted by evident progress 
in soviet human rights including the release of hundreds of 
political prisoners and the granting of exit permission for many who 
had long been refused the right to emigrate 
emigration rates from the soviet union are substantially higher 
and jamming of the voice of america radio liberty and other western 
broadcasts have ceased popadiuk said 
the threeconference schedule which reagan approved calls for a 
meeting in paris in 1989 a second in copenhagen in 1990 and the 
third in moscow in 1991 
popadiuk warned that the united states could reconsider 
participation in the moscow conference if the soviets should reverse 
their recent pattern of progress in the area of human rights 
the president recognizes that there is much yet to be done in 
the soviet union before that nation meets acceptable and universal 
human rights standards popadiuk said 
we will make it clear to the soviet union that the lack of 
future and institutionalized progress or a reversal of progress made 
to date will cause us to reconsider our decision to attend a moscow 
conference in 1991 he said 
the british foreign office placed similar limitations on its 
participation setting down specific requirements to be met by the 
soviets by 1991 if britain is to participate in the moscow 
conference 
the british statement said that by 1991 we shall expect to 
see 
implementation of gorbachevs promised changes in the criminal 
code 
effective guarantees for freedom of religion speech and 
emigration 
an end to the imprisonment of people for their political or 
religious beliefs or their incarceration in psychiatric hospitals 
that all longterm refusedniks are allowed to emigrate 
the human rights conferences and the european arms negotiations 
are linked and secretary of state george p shultz recommended the 
us agreement to reagan a us official told the associated press 
at present we believe that western concurrence in principle in 
such a moscow conference may be the best way to encourage and 
support future improvement in soviet human rights performance 
popadiuk said 
shultz is to meet sunday with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze in paris where they will be attending a conference of 
more than 100 nations on ways to halt the proliferation of chemical 
weapons 
the start of conventional arms reduction talks between the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact has been awaiting 
completion of the 35nation review in vienna of human rights in the 
soviet union and in eastern europe 
austria as host of the talks in vienna has invited the 
participating nations to attend a threeday closing meeting jan 17 
the new conventional stability talks on arms and troop reductions 
are due to be held between the 16 nato countries and the seven 
members of the communistled warsaw pact military alliance 
agreement to the moscow conference signaled a dramatic shift in 
british attitudes since it was first proposed in 1986 at that time 
senior officials of the british government described the proposal as 
outlandish and one top policymaker likened it to holding a 
whiskey distillers convention in riyadh capital of teetotaling 
saudi arabia 
but since then western countries have acknowledged changes or 
promises of change by gorbachev

a judge has ruled unconstitutional an 
ordinance designed to stop homosexual activity in orlando parks by 
prohibiting anyone from walking or sleeping in bushes 
the decision tuesday by judge walter komanski reverses the 
conviction of a retired air force colonel who was arrested even 
though he said he was in a park only because he was waiting for his 
wife the judge said the regulations are too vague an attempt to 
govern activity that is no threat to public safety 
ordinary innocent conduct is made criminal and the police are 
provided unfettered discretion to arrest lawabiding citizens who 
may stray into bushes or foliage at a city park komanski said in 
his ruling 
police have been using the ordinance for a couple of years to 
crack down on homosexual activity and loitering by transients in 
langford park near downtown police officials contended homosexuals 
were using paths that wind through dense groves of trees and bushes 
to commit sexual acts 
homosexual and civil rights groups have clashed with officers and 
city officials over enforcement of the law contending police were 
stopping only single men while ignoring women children and 
heterosexual couples 
i have no problem with them enforcing laws that apply to all 
people said michael wanzie a spokesman for the gay rights group 
we the people 
police chief dan wilson said homosexual activity has declined 
since last march and police have made fewer arrests 
the citys police legal adviser john ross said he would advise 
the department to continue enforcing the law because komanskis 
ruling is not binding on other judges but the defense attorney in 
the case predicted that other attorneys would cite komanskis ruling 
the law makes it a misdemeanor to sleep or otherwise be or 
remain in any bushes shrubs or other foliage in a city park 
violators are subject to a 500 fine and 60 days in jail 
the ruling was on an appeal by william marsden who was arrested 
may 19 1986 at langford park police said an undercover officer 
saw marsden walking in the park for two hours before disappearing 
into the bushes with another man 
marsden told county judge dorothy russell that he was walking in 
the park while waiting for his wife and walked off a boardwalk at 
the time another man happened to be walking in front of him 
marsden pleaded no contest was fined 100 and ordered to stay 
out of city parks for 60 days according to court records he 
appealed and the judges ruling overturns the conviction

a consultant under investigation in the 
defense department fraud case once left his car in the pentagon 
parking lot so a federal employee he had paid 100 a week could dump 
government documents in the trunk newly released ourt papers showed 
wednesday 
the papers search warrants and affadavits were made public as 
defense attorneys speculated that indictments in the nationwide 
investigation which began in september 1986 could be returned as 
early as friday 
sharon dibbley spokeswoman for us attorney henry hudson said 
the federal grand jury meets on thursday and friday she would not 
say whether hudson expects indictments then or when any 
pleabargain arrangements might be disclosed 
some companies and their employees are known to be talking to the 
government about plea bargaining 
prosecutors said last week they no longer need to keep under seal 
search warrants and affidavits issued in june because they have 
completed the investigative phase of the case papers have been 
released here and in brooklyn ny but remain under seal in st 
louis minneapolis and los angeles 
a search warrant for the home of william parkin a consultant who 
was employed by the navys joint cruise missile project office from 
1977 until 1983 provides a wealth of new detail about how parkin 
ran his consulting business using money and personal relationships 
to gather information 
at the heart of the case are allegations that consultants were 
paid by defense contractors and used the money to bribe pentagon 
employees to obtain inside information on contracts worth millions 
of dollars 
an unusual relationship developed between parkin and jean uebele 
a former contract negotiator at the cruise missile office where 
parkin once worked the search warrant showed information in the 
warrant was obtained by intercepting telephone conversations 
uebele frequently called for her biweekly checks of 50 the 
paper said parkins secretary at the time sheila wohlfarth once 
told uebele she was making the checks out to smiths maid 
service 
occasionally parkin asked uebele to give him copies of documents 
the warrant added in one conversation in march 1987 uebele 
called parkin and told him that if he parked his car in her place at 
the pentagon she would put materials in the trunk including all of 
her instructions cost and pricing lists reference books copies of 
every contract and information relating to mcdec mcdec is the 
marine corps development education center 
uebele retired from her navy job last week her office said her 
former employers said they did not have a forwarding telephone 
number and her home number was unlisted 
parkins attorney gerard treanor has said his client is 
confident he had done nthing wrong parkin is going to be found 
not guilty before a jury treanor said 
the warrant also discussed conservations between parkin mrs 
wohlfarth and her husband robert wohlfarth a navy patent attorney 
in an april 1987 conversation wohlfarth complained to his wife 
that parkin promptly paid the other guys he worked with or they 
called him the implication was that parkin owed wohlfarth for the 
information he had provided 
wohlfarth refused to discuss the matter and referred all calls to 
his attorney neil eggleston who was out of town 
parkin had a series of relationships with defense contractors 
including teledyne electronics of newbury park calif hazeltine 
corp long island ny northrop and unisys investigators say the 
contractors paid parkin thousands of dollars 
the court documents said investigators believe parkin may have 
been working for private companies before he retired from the 
government in 1983 
parkin has said that he was helping other consultants make 
money while working at jcmpo by providing them with information 
the papers said parkin also mentioned working for companies 
directly while in government 
while the investigation was under way in 1987 parkin apparently 
was finding business more difficult the search warrant said he 
told different people how it had become more difficult than in the 
past to obtain the information because more people were concerned 
about going to jail

the us f14 fighter that shot down libyan 
mig23 warplanes over the mediterranean sea on wednesday is more 
maneuverable and has more sophisticated radar and weapons than the 
sovietmade plane say retired navy officers 
we have felt that the f14 has been and continues to be the 
worlds best fighter plane said retired adm elmo zumwalt who 
served as chief of naval operations in 197074 
the american pilots were almost certainly better trained than 
their libyan adversaries other experts said 
you are kind of putting professionals up against amateurs 
said retired marine lt col john buchanan a pilot who flew the 
a6 another carrierbased aircraft 
zumwalt who lives in the virginia suburbs of washington said 
that even if the libyan pilots were as good as ours the f14 
could outpoint them 
us analyses of the mig23 show it to be a highly 
maneuverable a very highspeed craft but its avionics and missile 
systems cannot compete with the f14 he said 
norman polmar of the naval institute data base said that the 
the f14 is a lot more airplane a lot more expensive to build and 
to fly than the mig23 which epitomizes the soviet philosophy of 
building lots of less expensive airplanes 
the f14 has two engines to the migs one giving it greater 
acceleration has twin rear fins giving it greater maneuverability 
and although both fighters have wings that sweep back in flight 
those on the f14 operate automatically while the mig23s are 
directed by the pilot said polmar 
the f14 pilot does not have to think he just flies said 
polmar 
moreover the f14 pilot is assisted by a radarweapons officer 
while the mig23 pilot is alone 
one of the f14s strongest points is its sophisticated radar 
system which is capable of looking down and over great distances 
while tracking 24 targets at once according to the navy the awg9 
weapons tracking system can fire up to six phoenix missiles while 
continuing to scan the airspace according to the navy 
both the f14 and the mig23 entered production more than 15 
years ago and fly at similar speeds and heights 
the f14 tomcat which began aircraft carrier trials in 1972 
remains the premier allweather daynight air defense fighter in 
the world according to the navy production by grumman of long 
island ny is expected to continue into the 1990s 
a prototype of the mig23 was seen in public for the first time 
at a moscow air show in 1967 the fighter known to nato pilots as 
the flogger entered active duty in 1973 according to janes all 
the worlds aircraft 
the flogger is flown by all the air forces in the moscowled 
warsaw pact and by 1987 had been sold to a dozen other countries 
according to janes 
at takeoff floggers have wings that are fully extended to 46 
feet and sweep back to about 25 feet as the fighter cruises at mach 
2 twice the speed of sound or about 1400 mph at its maximum 
altitude of 59000 feet above sea level according to janes 
libyas mig23s are armed with one 23mm gsh23l twin barrel gun 
and can carry aa2 atoll airtoair missiles said polmar 
before the incident libyas sovietbuilt fighters included 44 
mig21s 131 mig23es 67 of the more advanced mig25 foxbats and 92 
sukhoi 2022 fighters additionally libya had 22 frenchmade 
mirages according to the military balance published by the 
londonbased institute for international strategic studies 
the american f14 also is a sweptwing aircraft taking off with 
wings spread to 64 feet and flying with the wings swept back to 38 
feet as it approaches a top speed of 234 times the speed of sound 
or 1544 mph at its ceiling of 50000 feet 
the tomcat is armed with an m61 vulcan 20mm gun and can carry 
four sparrow and four sidewinder missiles or a different mixture of 
sparrow sidewinder and phoenix missiles and it can carry bombs 
the navy said 
the f14s on wednesday fired sparrow and sidewinder missiles 
defense secretary frank c carlucci said

president reagan acknowledging recent human 
rights reforms in the soviet union agreed wednesday to us 
participation in a 1991 human rights conference in moscow 
the meeting was part of a threeconference schedule in europe 
approved by reagan 
the president decided to agree to this schedule including the 
moscow conference as a means of encouraging continuation of the 
significant progress in human rights that has taken place in the 
soviet union over the past three years deputy press secretary 
roman popadiuk told a briefing as regan vacationed in california 
britain quickly announced its concurrence in approving the 1991 
moscow conference paving the way for new eastwest negotiations to 
reduce conventional forces in europe 
britain and the united states had taken the toughest line on 
moscows ambition to host a human rights conference and wednesdays 
announcement opened the way to wrapping up 35nation talks between 
east and west in vienna due to end this month 
the ending of the current conference on security and cooperation 
in europe talks in vienna is a prerequisite for starting new 
eastwest negotiations on reducing conventional weapons and troops 
in europe 
popadiuk said reagans decision was prompted by evident progress 
in soviet human rights including the release of hundreds of 
political prisoners and the granting of exit permission for many who 
had long been refused the right to emigrate 
emigration rates from the soviet union are substantially higher 
and jamming of the voice of america radio liberty and other western 
broadcasts have ceased popadiuk said 
the threeconference schedule which reagan approved calls for a 
meeting in paris in 1989 a second in copenhagen in 1990 and the 
third in moscow in 1991 
popadiuk warned that the united states could reconsider 
participation in the moscow conference if the soviets should reverse 
their recent pattern of progress in the area of human rights 
the president recognizes that there is much yet to be done in 
the soviet union before that nation meets acceptable and universal 
human rights standards popadiuk said 
we will make it clear to the soviet union that the lack of 
future and institutionalized progress or a reversal of progress made 
to date will cause us to reconsider our decision to attend a moscow 
conference in 1991 he said 
the british foreign office placed similar limitations on its 
participation setting down specific requirements to be met by the 
soviets by 1991 if britain is to participate in the moscow 
conference 
the british statement said that by 1991 we shall expect to 
see 
implementation of gorbachevs promised changes in the criminal 
code 
effective guarantees for freedom of religion speech and 
emigration 
an end to the imprisonment of people for their political or 
religious beliefs or their incarceration in psychiatric hospitals 
that all longterm refusedniks are allowed to emigrate 
the human rights conferences and the european arms negotiations 
are linked and secretary of state george p shultz recommended the 
us agreement to reagan a us official told the associated press 
at present we believe that western concurrence in principle in 
such a moscow conference may be the best way to encourage and 
support future improvement in soviet human rights performance 
popadiuk said 
shultz is to meet sunday with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze in paris where they will be attending a conference of 
more than 100 nations on ways to halt the proliferation of chemical 
weapons 
the start of conventional arms reduction talks between the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact has been awaiting 
completion of the 35nation review in vienna of human rights in the 
soviet union and in eastern europe 
austria as host of the talks in vienna has invited the 
participating nations to attend a threeday closing meeting jan 17 
the new conventional stability talks on arms and troop reductions 
are due to be held between the 16 nato countries and the seven 
members of the communistled warsaw pact military alliance 
agreement to the moscow conference signaled a dramatic shift in 
british attitudes since it was first proposed in 1986 at that time 
senior officials of the british government described the proposal as 
outlandish and one top policymaker likened it to holding a 
whiskey distillers convention in riyadh capital of teetotaling 
saudi arabia 
but since then western countries have acknowledged changes or 
promises of change by gorbachev

enough body parts including a severed head 
have been found and reassembled to tentatively identify the victim 
as a city man with a checkered past who met a grisly end around 
christmas police said wednesday 
murders always gruesome when they decapitate the body and 
then dissect it it becomes that much more gruesome said 
allegheny county police superintendent robert kroner 
body parts have been found in scattered locations east of 
pittsburgh the victim is thought to be anthony patrick michalowski 
a 22yearold unemployed pittsburgh resident known to hang out on 
the street 
the head severed from his body with a machete or similar weapon 
was found along with a 1 to 2foot piece of large intestine in a 
plastic garbage bag in a commercial garbage bin behind a shopping 
center in north versailles on dec 27 the victim had been dead 24 
to 48 hours said coroner joshua perper 
the lower jaw had been removed apparently to hinder 
identification it was found tuesday outside a steel mill several 
miles away in north braddock a tongue small intestines and several 
strands of hair were found in the same plastic garbage bag with the 
jaw authorities believe the body pieces came from the same body and 
are testing them for confirmation 
a dog turned up a lung dec 28 in whitaker across the 
monongahela river from north braddock lab tests determined that the 
lung and head came from the same body 
the coroners staff stitched the lower jaw and lip to the head on 
tuesday allowing police to distribute a sketch of the victims 
face michalowskis aunt and brother recognized the sketch on 
television notified police and then identified the blond blueeyed 
head at the morgue tuesday night dental records showing two 
fillings also suggest the victim was michalowski 
police said a close comparison of the victims teeth with 
michalowskis dental records will confirm the identification 
we no longer have to call him the head kroner said 
thats a terrible thing to have to refer to a human being as the 
head 
identifying the victim however is only part of a victory 
the superintendent said 
weve got an awful lot of work to do our jobs are only really 
beginning now he said now detectives have to go out and start 
interviewing people start tracing his steps so we can get back to 
the night of his demise if thats possible 
michalowski was last seen alive around 7 pm christmas eve 
standing on pittsburghs liberty avenue a downtown strip known for 
prostitution and pornography kroner said 
he spent a lot of time downtown he said he had a lengthy 
record for things street people do such as disorderly conduct 
michalowskis criminal record released by police lists about 10 
charges since 1984 and he was awaiting trial on robbery charges 
according to kroner 
detectives were checking reports that michalowski may have been 
associated with prostitution or drugs kroner said 
were hearing a lot of stories he said we cant 
substantiate the rumors 
michalowski lived at times with his aunt carol michalowski on 
pittsburghs north side she said her nephew had gone out for a 
christmas tree prior to the holiday and never returned 
a head thats all ive got i dont even know if theyll give 
me that she told kdkatv 
detectives say they may need the rest of the body to be sure that 
michalowski was murdered and not just mutilated after dying from 
another cause 
the rest of the body certainly would be helpful kroner said

private exporters have sold an additional 
440000 metric tons of us wheat to china at subsidized prices and 
also more corn to the soviet union the agriculture department 
reported wednesday 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said the wheat was part of 1 million 
tons authorized dec 30 for china under the export enhancement 
program or eep 
under the eep arrangement exporters can sell wheat and other 
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in 
order to meet foreign competition exporters then collect free 
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or 
subsidies 
the wheat sales equal to about 173 million bushels were 
handled by five companies continental grain co 70000 tons 
cargill inc 270000 tradigrain inc 30000 tradecom inc 
30000 and louis dreyfus corp 40000 
sims said the wheat was sold for january delivery and will carry 
an average subsidy rate of 2264 per ton or about 62 cents per 
bushel 
counting some wheat left over from previous eep arrangements 
china has 570000 tons still available under the program 
the soviet union bought an additional 250000 tons of corn for 
delivery under a longterm grain agreement with the united states 
that boosted corn sales to the soviets in the 198889 agreement year 
to nearly 102 million tons 
besides the corn the soviets have ordered 370000 tons of wheat 
450000 tons of soybeans and 1132500 tons of soybean meal plus

has been subsidized 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 440000 tons of 
wheat would be about 161 million bushels the latest corn sales to 
the soviet union would be about 99 million bushels 
wheat prices at the farm have been averaging around 4 per 
bushel according to recent usda market figures making the new sale 
worth an estimated 64 million the corn at 260 per bushel could

surgeons transplanted a third liver into a 
5yearold boy whose second operation was made possible by a mother 
who volunteered an organ intended for her child 
jason point of deale md was in critical condition wednesday 
considered normal for recent transplant patients on tuesday he 
received the third transplant in a 17hour operation at childrens 
hospital of pittsburgh

last november after problems developed with that liver he was 
given a liver originally intended for candi thomas 6 of accokeek 
md 
penny thomas offered to let jason have a transplant first when he 
took a turn for the worse as candi herself the veteran of a prior 
transplant was being readied for surgery 
surgeons eventually corrected candis liver problem without 
another transplant and she left the hospital dec 16 
jason needed the third transplant because his condition had 
gone downhill over the past week or so said hospital spokeswoman 
lynn mcmahon doctors discovered an abscess in the liver two days

the shooting down of two libyan jet fighters by 
american military planes is just another bitter episode in eight 
years of bad blood between president reagan and libyan leader 
moammar gadhafi 
the tone of the uslibyan longdistance relationship was set in 
1981 when the new president expelled libyan diplomats from the 
united states for an unacceptable pattern of conduct and it 
continued its unyielding way through last week when less than a 
month away from leaving office reagan officially declared that 
libya still was not meeting minimum standards of human behavior 
the united states has shown its disgust with the libyans 
behavior the past three years by freezing libyan assets in this 
country a paper reagan signed on dec 28 extends the authority for 
the us sanctions for another six months because reagan said 
the government of libya continues to use and support international 
terrorism 
tension between the two nations has been rising in recent weeks 
with the united states charging that libya has built a plant for 
producing chemical weapons libya said the factory produces 
pharmaceuticals 
reagan said military action against the plant was under 
consideration 
at the pentagon on wednesday defense secretary frank carlucci 
said in response to questions about the shooting incident that the 
american planes and their carrier the uss john f kennedy were not 
in the area with the intention of attacking any such factory and 
had no connection whatsoever with it 
at the state department spokesman charles redman said it may 
be ironic but the two things are not related 
gadhafi called the incident an example of increased american 
terrorism and said he would meet challenge with challenge 
the libyan leader has been open about his own support for some 
terrorism in 1985 when palestinians attacked airports in rome and 
vienna killing 15 people including an 11yearold american girl 
gadhafi called the incidents the most sacred action on earth 
asked about those remarks reagan said i dont answer fellows 
who think its all right to shoot 11yearold girls 
gadhafi has been at libyas helm since he overthrew king idris in 
1969 one of his first actions then was to close down us and 
british military bases 
he nationalized most oil companies and expelled more than 20000 
foreigners although thousands of americans remained in libya 
working in the oil fields 
with his oil money libya remained the thirdlargest foreign 
supplier of oil to the united states gadhafi bought billions of 
dollars worth of soviet arms he proclaimed his kinship with fidel 
castro and the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
in december 1979 a mob ransacked and burned the american embassy 
in tripoli in support of the iranians who seized the us embassy 
and took hostages in tehran thenpresident carter ordered the 
embassy in libya closed but american oil companies maintained 
business 
in may 1981 reagan severed diplomatic ties and in august came 
the shooting of two libyan warplanes the us government said were 
trying to intercept two us navy f14 fighters over the gulf of 
sidra 
three months later there were reports that libya had sent hit 
teams to assassinate reagan vice president george bush and other 
top government officials the tightened security put in place in 
washington as a result still is in place 
in december 1981 the us halted travel to libya and asked 
americans to leave that country some did but many did not the 
following march the reagan administration banned all oil imports 
from libya and exxon and mobil withdrew their operations 
in june 1983 the us navy staged maneuvers off libyas coast 
amid allegations that libyans were supporting dissidents in 
westernbacked chad and sudan navy jets chased away two libyan 
mig23 fighters 
more shooting broke out in march 1986 when american planes 
extended their operations below the line of death drawn by 
gadhafi across the gulf of sidra and libyans fired six 
surfacetoair missiles toward us aircraft missing them 
us aircraft retaliated by shooting and setting afire a libyan 
patrol boat and hitting a shoreline missile site the 
administrations actions were applauded by congressional leaders 
democrats as well as republicans 
on april 15 american planes bombed five military targets around 
the major port cities of tripoli and benghazi to punish libya for 
what reagan called gadhafis reign of terror he said the raid 
was in retaliation for the fatal bombing of a berlin night club and 
described it as an engagement in the long battle 
there is nothing new about the uslibyan tensions nearly two 
centuries ago president thomas jefferson dispatched warships to 
blockade tripoli harbor when the ruler of tripolitana youssef 
karamanli demanded 250000 a year to prevent his pirates from 
raiding us merchant ships in the mediterranean 
then as now americans said freedom of the seas was at stake

as much as 2 million in coins owned by the 
federal reserve bank of chicago is missing and the fbi is 
investigating the suburban armored car company where the money was 
stored officials said wednesday 
the fed suspended its dealings with the public armored car inc 
of bensenville last week after an audit revealed the shortage said 
nancy goodman a spokeswoman for the agency 
maureen dillon a receptionist at public armored said company 
president john boyle was the only person who could talk about the 
shortage and he was not in the office wednesday 
the exact amount of money missing was not released but ms 
goodman said it was a substantial loss 
the only thing we had on deposit there was coins and when we 
discovered the shortage we removed the rest of our funds to our own 
vaults ms goodman said 
the fbi was investigating ms goodman said 
fbi spokesman bob long declined to say whether the agency was on 
the case 
the chicago tribune quoted sources it did not identify wednesday 
as saying the loss was about 2 million but said the exact amount 
would not be known for several days 
public armored was serving as a depot for coins being transferred 
between banks and the fed ms goodman said the company began 
working with the agency in july 
the company was one of six storing coins and making coin 
deliveries for the fed to banks and savings institutions in the 
chicago area ms goodman said because insurance covers the loss 
no financial institution will be affected by the shortage she said 
but they will have to make arrangements with other armored car 
companies 
we inspected their public armoreds facility when we started 
with them and did a second onsite inspection in late december 
thats when we found the shortage ms goodman said 
the money shortage was very unusual because the fed and the 
firms hired to deliver cash are in daily telephone contact to 
confirm how much money is delivered and to whom she said 
we balanced with them public armored by telephone every day 
and those numbers balanced she said when we went to do a 
physical inspection we found less money than what should have been 
there 
when a bank wants to make a deposit in coins to its account at 
the fed the coins are picked up by an armored company and taken to 
a warehouse and the agency is notified the transaction has been 
made she explained when a bank needs coins the fed is notified 
and a delivery is made from the warehouse 
several banks use public armored to hold large amounts of coins 
she said the company also has contracts to pick up coins for the 
illinois state toll highway authority

a panel of researchers began looking 
wednesday for ways to speed approval of drugs for treating cancer 
and aids and the food and drug administration declared that drugs 
for the desperately ill remain our highest priority 
critics have accused the fda of being too conservative in its 
evaluation of new drugs for cancer and aids at the panels initial 
meeting officials of the national cancer institute said the 
regulatory agency could make therapies available earlier without 
sacrificing patient safety 
fda commissioner frank e young said recent changes in the 
agencys approval process will make new drugs available in half the 
time it used to take 
already fda review takes an average of seven months for cancer 
drugs he said and the only aids drug approved so far underwent 
review in 107 days 
young assured members of the panel of academic and drug industry 
researchers that drugs for the desperately ill remain our highest 
priority 
however bruce chabner director of cancer treatment at the 
national cancer institute said the fda should be more flexible and 
encourage early testing of new drugs in children who have cancer and 
aids 
samuel broder director of the national cancer institute said 
the fda is too stringent in the proof it requires that a new drug 
extend survival longer than existing drugs the result broder said 
is that effective therapies are being rationed 
dr louis lasagna chairman of the study panel said his 
committee hopes to establish mechanisms to mediate the fireworks 
and improve communications between the fda and the cancer institute 
because there is so much public pressure regarding aids about 
not wasting time getting treatments to victims we might be able 
to capitalize on that concern to bring about improvements in the 
drug approval process lasagna said 
dr armand hammer chairman of the presidents cancer panel who 
appointed the study group last year said he believes the fdas 
process for approving drugs can be reduced from several years to 
less than a year 
he said the fdas recent improvements are not enough but in 
defense of the agency he said fda wants to be sure of the 
safety and this is their first concern and it should be they 
certainly dont want to give them patients drugs that are going to 
kill them 
on the other hand we have to have indications that we can 
prolong life of people with aids he said using that incurable 
and fatal disease as an example 
so far the fda has approved only one drug azt that has been 
shown to prolong the lives of victims of aids or acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
dr anthony fauci who is in charge of aids research at the 
national institutes of health reported extraordinary progress 
in the search for a drug that will significantly prolong the lives 
of aids victims 
but to someone who is suffering from a lethal disease who does 
not have a nontoxic drug thats available those types of 
scientific advances really dont mean much he said 
theres a lot of despair out there and its understandable 
because of the terrible scourge of this disease but we in science 
are cautiously optimistic he said 
fauci said it is unlikely that a penicillin equivalent will 
be found as a cureall for aids

an earthquake of the type that killed tens of 
thousands last month in soviet armenia would cause many fewer deaths 
in a typical american city because of differences in construction 
standards a us engineer said wednesday 
loring wyllie a san francisco structural engineer and coleader 
of an american team of experts that surveyed the soviet earthquake 
site said most of the buildings that collapsed were poorly 
constructed built from a common design and of concrete that 
collapsed like a stack of cards 
we would have a lot less loss of life due to the diversity of 
our construction wyllie said at a news conference 
he said the soviet buildings were constructed from blueprints 
developed in moscow for use throughout the soviet union most of the 
destroyed buildings had been were built in recent years using 
prefabricated concrete parts not at all of the quality you would 
find here in the united states he said 
if that kind of construction happened on a job here in the 
united stastes the inspector would have rejected it and the 
contractor would have to redo it said wyllie 
he said concrete used in the soviet construction was frequently 
filled with rock pockets that weakened the material and that 
concrete beams were often joined together in a haphazard fashion 
as a result when the earthquake struck buildings up to 10 
stories high collapsed very quickly he said 
fred krimgold an expert from the virginia polytechnic institute 
and a member of an american search and resuce team that arrived in 
armenia four days after the earthquake said the building design was 
a prime factor in the high number of deaths 
the floor system of these buildings is made up of concrete 
planks he said when these floors collapsed we got very tight 
compact rubble with few voids where people might have survived 
as a result this was one of the most deadly earthquakes weve 
seen said krimgold typically the ratio of injury to fatality 
is on the order of three or four to one in this earthquake it was 
the reverse 
krimgold said that though the official death toll of the 
earthquake has been placed at about 24000 he believes the exact 
number will never be welldocumented some soviet officials he 
said estimated that there were more than 100000 unregistered 
people living in the area and that thousands of bodies buried in the 
rubble will never be recovered 
the rubble of many buildings that were thought to contain people 
said krimgold now are simply being bulldozed level with no effort 
to recover bodies 
there have been 24000 bodies recovered he said but dont 
mistake the number of bodies found with the actual number of dead 
fifty to sixty thousand probably 60 is a reasonable estimate 
krimgold who has participated in rescue efforts following 
earthquakes in mexico and central america said more people survived 
in those disasters because the buildings collapsed in large pieces 
these large pieces left hollows or pockets within the rubble where 
trapped people could survive until they were rescued 
delays in reaching trapped soviet victims also cost many lives 
he said 
we uncovered a number of people who unfortunately had died only 
recently before we got to them they were not dead at the time of 
the collapse said krimgold many people died of exposure 
trapped in the buildings the nighttime temperature was below 
freezing 
the armenian earthquake struck around 1140 am on dec 7 the 
main shock measured 68 on the richter scale which is considered a 
strong quake it was followed a few minutes later by an aftershock 
that measured 58 
about 80 percent of buildings in leninakan a town of 250000 
were leveled and a number of smaller towns nearby were destroyed 
john filson a us geological survey expert and a coleader of 
the american team said aftershocks continue in the area with one 
measuring 50 occurring as recently as saturday 
filson and wyllie headed an 18member team of specialists 
organized by the usgs the national academy of sciences and the 
national science foundation at the request of soviet authorities 
the group spent two weeks in the armenian earthquake area gathering 
scientific and engineering information in collaboration with soviet 
experts 
filson said the information will be analyzed and shared 
internationally in an effort to better understand earthquakes and 
how to construct safer buildings in areas of seismic activity

the customs service said wednesday it will 
classify imported sport utility vehicles like the suzuki samurai and 
most small vans as trucks subjecting them to duty rates 10 times 
higher than those for cars 
deputy customs commissioner michael lane said that in the past 
these vehicles sometimes had been classified as cars upon which a 
25 percent duty is imposed and at other times as trucks subject 
to a 25 percent duty 
the deciding factor often was whether the vehicles were fitted 
with back seats and other amenities 
lane said auto industry officials have estimated the ruling could 
affect 100000 to 250000 or more vehicles many of which will be 
switched from the car to truck category and could net the government 
hundreds of millions of dollars in higher tariffs 
wednesdays ruling specifically applied to suzukis samurai and 
yoe but customs officers have been instructed to use the same 
standard in classifying other imported vehicles the agency said 
chrysler corp spokesman al slechter said the automaker was 
ecstatic about the ruling he said it would end manipulation of 
the tariff system and increase treasury revenues 
suzuki spokeswoman laura segall said most samurais already were 
being imported as trucks but that the company was disappointed 
the customs service had ruled against allowing some sport vehicles 
to be admitted as cars 
vehicles imported as trucks are not covered by the voluntary 
restraint agreement under which japanese automakers limit the number 
of cars brought into the united states

congress budget agency said wednesday that 
unless new taxes or spending cuts are approved the federal deficit 
next year will be 141 billion 14 billion higher than the white 
house estimates and well in excess of deficitreduction goals 
releasing its forecast only days before president reagan sends 
his final budget to congress the nonpartisan congressional budget 
office said it expects the deficits to decline only slightly in 
future years unless action is taken 
by fiscal 1993 when grammrudman mandates a balanced budget the 
federal deficit would still be 129 billion based on current 
trends the report said 
the deficit during the current fiscal year will be about 155 
billion the same as last year according to the cbo report and it 
will drop only slightly next year to 141 billion if current 
government services are maintained with no new taxes 
that means 41 billion in spending cuts or new revenues would be 
needed under the cbo projections to reduce the fiscal 1990 deficit 
to the 100 billion target in the budget balancing law 
however the administration using more optimistic economic 
assumptions is projecting a 1990 deficit of 127 billion making it 
easier to hit the 100 billion deficit target required for reagans 
final budget 
if presidentelect george bush and the congress dont approve 
enough spending cuts or new taxes to get within 10 billion of the 
grammrudman goal the law imposes automatic spending cuts across a 
broad swath of domestic and defense programs to take effect next 
october 
bush has said repeatedly he would cut the deficit without any new 
taxes leaders of the democraticcontrolled congress have been 
skeptical of his approach which he terms a flexible freeze on 
spending 
president reagans 12 trillion budget which goes to congress 
next monday will propose spending cuts asset sales and hikes in 
some user fees to reduce the deficit to 925 billion reagans 
budget director joseph wright has said 
the congressional budget office provides congress with many of 
its budget estimates as it considers spending legislation through 
the year however the grammrudman law is triggered by the figures 
provided by the presidents office of management and budget 
the cbo deficit projections compared to those made by the agency 
last august are 7 billion higher for the current fiscal year and 
5 billion higher for fiscal 1990 the key reason the cost of 
shoring up the ailing savings and loan industry 
the cbo deficit report was based on projections that the economy 
would continue a slow but steady growth of 22 percent in 1990 and 
1991 and 23 percent in each of the next two years with 
unemployment holding steady inflation increasing slightly next year 
and interest rates gradually declining 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said the 
cbo report was troubling because it may indicate the white house 
outlook was too sanguine it that happens deficit cutting efforts 
may be found inadequate as the new fiscal year approaches 
triggering grammrudmans automatic spending cuts 
if the projections are overly optimistic now that means 
reassessments could mean that we would face automatic spending 
cuts to make up the difference he said 
the more we use the rosy scenario approach the more we lose 
touch with reality he said

the transportation department announced new 
security requirements for airports wednesday that will require 
tighter control over restricted areas likely through the use of 
computerized identification cards for employees 
the department said the new federal aviation administration 
regulations will be phased in over the next 2 years with the 
busiest airports required to comply by early 1991 
although airport operators will be allowed to meet the new 
security requirements through various ways many are expected to use 
a computercontrolled identification card system to control access 
to restricted areas 
the tighter regulations were proposed last march 
the faa estimates that 270 airports ultimately will have to 
install the computerized id system or another method or procedure to 
provide a required level of security 
faa administrator allan mcartor said the new requirements will 
provide tighter control over employee id cards both in terms of 
who carries them and where an employee can and cannot go at an 
airport 
he said the cards can be electronically coded to permit access 
only to those areas an employee is authorized to enter a card also 
can be made ineffective if it is lost or the employee assigned the 
card quits without returning it

libyas leader col moammar gadhafi 
asked moscow to send part of its mediterranean fleet to act as a 
buffer in a possible uslibyan confrontation the yugoslav news 
agency tanjug reported wednesday 
tanjug reported later that tripoli residents jammed filling 
stations in a flight from the libyan capital hours after hearing 
that us warplanes shot down two libyan fighter jets over the 
mediterranean on wednesday 
it said gadhafis home was turned into a fortress with 
antiaircraft missiles mounted on its roof 
the initial tanjug report from tripoli which gave no source for 
its information apparently was filed after the us defense 
department announced the air incident tanjug said the news was 
neither confirmed nor denied in libya 
tanjug the official yugoslav news agency has its own 
correspondent in tripoli and his reports have often proved reliable 
in the past 
the libyan leader gadhafi reacting to the news about 
american movements in the mediterranean asked moscow to send part 
of its mediterranean fleet to the area of the forthcoming american 
maneuvers to avoid direct libyanamerican clashes which could serve 
as an excuse for new american and possibly israeli attacks on vital 
targets in libya tanjug said 
it did not specify which part of the mediterranean gadhafi had in 
mind or say how many soviet ships he wanted to see involved 
in its later report tanjug said that only a few hours after 
the united states shot down the libyan planes migration of 
citizens from tripoli was noticeable 
gas stations in tripoli were jammed with cars the same way as 
before the american attack on the north african nation in 1986 
the agency said 
moments after the news of the incident an avalanche of 
protests against american aggression struck libya with 
political activists calling for armed struggle against the 
united states tanjug said 
tanjug reported that libya took heavy military precautions 
following word that us fleet movements were under way in the 
mediterranean 
gadhafis residence in tripoli has been turned into a 
fortress with new tank and antiaircraft reinforcements and with 
frenchbuilt antiaircraft missiles mounted on its roof tanjug 
reported 
the agency said mobilization of libyas reserve troops reportedly 
has been ordered and military aircraft based at airfields on the 
mediterranean coast have been moved inland to points in the sahara 
desert 
in tripoli guns were mounted at key street intersections and 
gadhafis personal guard took over traffic duties from police 
tanjug said 
the correspondent also said without identifying sources that he 
learned that col junis jabber the commander of libyas armed 
forces may have lost his job in a continuing reorganization of the 
radical arab nations military strength

libya asked wednesday that the security 
council hold an emergency meeting and condemn what it called us 
aggression in shooting down two jet fighters it said were on an 
innocent reconnaissance mission 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar issued a statement 
saying he regrets the incident and hopes both sides will exercise 
restraint so as not to heighten existing tension in the region 
libyan ambassador ali sunni muntasser met with security council 
president ismail razali of malaysia and delivered a letter 
requesting the urgent session the 15member council scheduled 
informal consultations on the libyan request for thursday morning 
without a doubt we ask for condemnation of this premeditated 
act of aggression said muntasser the acting permanent 
representative the planes he said were unarmed on 
reconnaissance ordinary routine flying 
it was an innocent flight he said 
he declined to say if libya would retaliate saying it wanted the 
security council to take its responsibility 
in washington officials said us navy planes shot down the 
libyan jet fighters over the mediterranean sea after the american 
aircraft were threatened while conducting routine operations in 
international airspace 
the incident was the first fighting between the united states and 
libya since american jets bombed tripoli in 1986 and came after the 
united states charged that libya had recently built a new chemical 
weapons plant 
although the reagan administration has refused to rule out an 
attack on the plant us officials said the downing of the libyan 
planes was unrelated to the dispute over the facility 
at the united nations muntasser said i presented a letter 
from the libyan government asking the security council to meet 
urgently to discuss this aggression of us forces against two 
libyan reconaissance planes on routine duty they were attacked and 
shot down 
we expect the whole international community to deplore this we 
expect even the american people will yesterday it was threats 
today it was acts 
un spokesman francois giuliani said perez de cuellar had been 
informed by both sides that official letters about the incident were 
being sent from washington and tripoli perez de cuellar also met 
with us ambassador herbert s okun but details of their 
discussion were not disclosed

a federal appeals court panel wednesday 
rejected a bid by oliver l norths attorneys to avoid showing 
prosecutors a summary of classified testimony the defense expects to 
present at the irancontra trial 
the us court of appeals dissolved a temporary stay it issued 
tuesday and denied a motion to permanently bar us district judge 
gerhard gesell from giving the office of independent counsel 
lawrence walsh a summary of proposed defense testimony that is 
classified 
the request could have forced a delay in the trial now set for 
jan 31 
norths lawyers have said providing the 162page summary to 
prosecutors would unfairly present them with information on norths 
defense and they petitioned the appeals court for a writ of mandamus 
but in a twopage order a threejudge appeals court panel said 
such a step is to be invoked only in extraordinary situations 
adding that although north had raised serious claims that he will 
suffer deprivation of constitutional rights he fails to satisfy 
the stringent legal standard for obtaining such relief 
this court will not interrupt a criminal proceeding and invade 
the province of the district court when petitioner has an effective 
remedy through direct appeal from a final judgment of conviction 
said the appeals court 
the decision came as walsh met with attorney general dick 
thornburgh to discuss the continuing problems posed by classified 
documents in the case against the former national security council 
aide 
walsh who said only that he had a very serious discussion 
with thornburgh was accompanied by aides who deal with the secrecy 
issue as well as john keker recently named the lead trial 
prosecutor in the north case 
it was learned that walsh sought the meeting with thornburgh to 
discuss the implications of gesells refusal tuesday to reconsider a 
dec 12 decision ordering the inclusion of certain sensitive 
references in 300 documents prosecutors want to use as trial 
exhibits 
walsh had asked gesell to modify the order to accommodate 
concerns raised last month by intelligence agencies 
meanwhile in a fourpage memo filed tuesday in federal court and 
publicly released wednesday norths attorneys reiterated their 
objections to being subjected to being limited to an arbitrary 
limit of 300 purportedly classified documents in a defense of 
north at his trial 
the figure had been set dec 12 by gesell 
norths lawyers filed a narroweddown list of 300 classified 
documents on tuesday 
there is no justification for such a restriction in this global 
case challenging aspects of three years of united states foreign 
policy brendan sullivan and other north lawyers said in the memo 
walshs office will be limited to using some 300 classified 
documents in prosecuting north 
north has deemed some 3500 documents to be relevant to his 
defense and the memo by his attorneys said the courts limitation is 
omitting thousands of other obviously relevant documents 
norths attorneys said the defense should not be compelled to 
select its 300 documents when it is unclear what counts will be 
tried 
the conspiracy and several other counts in the case are in 
jeopardy because the judge has directed more complete disclosure of 
information in classified documents than us intelligence agencies 
appear willing to grant 
us intelligence agencies are concerned that sensitive 
references in the documents walsh plans to use could disclose covert 
operations or secret dealings with foreign nations gesell said last 
month the administration had deleted too much material from 
classified documents the prosecution plans to use the judge 
detailed what must be disclosed in order to give north a fair trial 
and gesell on tuesday rejected a request from walsh to reconsider 
that order 
under the classified information procedures act the attorney 
general can decide to seek dismissal of criminal charges to prevent 
disclosure of secrets that might endanger national security 
in their memo norths lawyers also said the court should have 
held a hearing to determine the relevance of the 3500 documents and 
that the restriction of 300 documents compels north to identify for 
prosecutors the documents the defense plans to use without even 
knowing the substance of the testimony by the prosecutions 
witnesses 
north also says he is entitled to know what information in the 
3500 documents he wants to use is classified and what is not 
classified

the official death toll stands at two but six 
other crewmen from a container ship that sank last week have joined 
thousands of people lost at sea who never get a final resting place 
the search stays indefinitely in a suspended mode us coast 
guard petty officer ellen marie harrington said wednesday and 
thats difficult because part of the grieving process is tied up in 
having some sort of memorial or burial service 
after the 254foot ship sank in 25foot seas on its journey from 
port elizabeth nj to bermuda five crewmen were plucked from the 
water two of whom died six crew members were still missing 
wednesday and presumed dead the coast guard said 
you race out there with hopes of making a rescue and then for 
one reason or another it doesnt happen as time goes on theres a 
definite psychological letdown because you start to edge toward the 
reality of the conditions and the challenge said lt jonathan 
trumble thats when you finally have to leave and go home 
emptyhanded or with corpses 
when we do have a successful search theres a feeling that 
well we kind of stole one from the ocean this time he said 
trumble was heading the coast guards command post in boston when 
distress signals came in from the lloyd bermuda which was about 200 
miles off the coast of new jersey violent seas and a sudden shift 
of cargo sent crewmen racing to unlash the ships life rafts 
trumble said air and naval rescue teams mobilized with optimism 
when they go out theres a 100 percent chance of finding them 
we had high hopes that all 11 men were in life rafts but as the 
case wore on those odds decreased considerably he said then 
theres a real stomachwrenching feeling theres a real gut feeling 
when you finally have to say look weve done everything we 
possibly could do and i call them home 
the rev barbara crafton a minister at the seamens church in 
port newark nj said it is with the searchs suspension that 
families begin a troubled mourning process 
the grieving process is denied these families she said 
from the pastoral point of view there is a closure when you have 
in fact seen the body of the one you loved as painful as it is 
in dealing with widows of seafarers those whose husbands are 
lost and never seen again get stuck in uncertainty she added 
they know intellectually hes dead but emotionally there is a 
lack of acceptance 
about 25 people attended a memorial service friday at the 
seamens church a regular gathering place for the lloyd bermudas 
crew members and other seafarers passing through the port city 
a memorial isnt much but it is something concrete that 
certifies in an emotional way that this mans life is over and that 
this is a life that had meaning she said 
during the past decade an average 79 seafarers on american 
vessels have been listed annually as lost and presumed dead at sea

whether he should be sent to the united states to stand trial for 
blowing up a plane 
mohammed rashid is accused of bombing of a pan am jetliner over 
hawaii in 1982 killing a 15yearold japanese boy dead and injuring 
15 people 
the court said he may flee the country if he is freed before a 
final decision on the us request for his extradition 
no date has been set for rashids next extradition hearing which 
has been delayed for months on the grounds that the united states 
has failed to provide enough evidence and documents to implicate 
rashid in the bombing 
rashid 39 was arrested at athens airport by greek police 
following a tip by us embassy officials last year he was 
sentenced to jail for seven months for possessing a false passport 
the extradition request is viewed as a test of greeces 
willingness to crack down on terrorism 
a group of us congressmen have introduced legislation calling 
on the greek government to extradite rashid who officials say may 
have information regarding the pan am bombing over scotland two 
weeks ago

house in coming weeks also condemned greeces socialist government

presidentelect bush savoring his 40state 
1988 victory anew announced to a joint session of congress on 
wednesday the official results of his own presidential election 
triumph 
this announcement shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of 
the persons elected president and vice president of the united 
states bush intoned as he presided over a housesenate session 
called to certify results of the electoral college ballots cast last 
month 
it had been 152 years since a vice president had been able to 
peform such a task grinning broadly bush rapped the gavel and 
declared the joint session dissolved 
it was his final expected official act as the constitutional 
presiding officer of the senate and it marked the first time a vice 
president had been able to preside over his own presidential 
election certification since martin van buren did so in 1837 
in a closely orchestrated session in the house chamber the vice 
president proclaimed that george bush of the state of texas had 
received 426 electoral votes to massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
111 votes democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen got 
one vote filed in protest of the electoral college system by one 
elector 
the session was called under a provision of the constitution 
which gives congress the job of passing final judgment on the 
authenticity of each states electoral tally 
after announcing the outcome bush shook hands with house speaker 
jim wright dtexas and was given a standing ovation by members of 
the house and senate then he phoned vice presidentelect dan quayle 
of indiana to notify him 
quayle did not attend the votecounting ceremony his spokesman 
said because he had no official role and thought it more important 
to work on hiring his staff and on plans for the inauguration on 
jan 20 
he didnt want to go it would have just been a photo op 
said press secretary dave beckwith 
on another subject bush spokeswoman sheila tate said the vice 
president had been notified at 6 am of the us navys attack on 
two libyan fighter planes over the mediterranean and hes been 
kept informed throughout the day 
bush also was reported to be nearing an announcement of his 
choice for energy secretary however bush transition sources said 
james schlesinger who held that job during the carter 
administration ias no longer viewed as a serious contender for the 
post 
the vice president and schlesinger met last week to talk about 
energy releated issues but the job was not offered said a 
senior bush transition official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
sources close to bush said he still hasnt made up his mind on

jewish groups expressed outrage wednesday at 
the reported involvement of a west german company in libyas 
suspected chemical weapons production saying the country that 
gassed millions of jews bears responsibility for preventing the 
production of such arms 
the groups said they were also investigating whether companies in 
other countries had provided help for libyas chemical weapons 
plant and would protest to those countries once their findings are 
complete 
the united states has said a west german company along with 
firms in japan and italy supplied technology and expertise for the 
libyan plant located 35 miles southwest of tripoli swiss japanese 
and south korean firms were also reportedly involved in building 
what libya contends is a pharmaceutical factory 
us officials told west german chancellor helmut kohl last 
december that a company called imhausenchemie was one of those 
helping libya but foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said 
wednesday his countrys investigation had not found any involvement 
by the company in the plant 
the director of the simon wiesenthal center a nonprofit 
organization which hunts surviving nazi criminals around the world 
said kohls office told him imhausenchemie had not applied for an 
export license to libya 
rabbi marvin heir said the deputy director of kohls office 
stepan eisel told him in a telephone conversation tuesday that if 
investigators determine the company had exported material to libya 
without permission it would be prosecuted 
heir said he had sent kohl a telegram to express his shock 
the idea of german firms helping moammar gadhafi the foe of 
israel and a dangerous enemy of the world is repugnant to jews 
especially because of the holocaust rabbi heir said it is an 
unforgivable act that should be harshly punished he added in an 
interview 
its part of germanys responsibility to atone for the past by 
preventing chemical warfare from ever happening again heir said 
israel singer secretarygeneral of the world jewish congress 
said his group was making representations to several governments 
to express our deep concern and profound anxiety at this volatile 
and dangerous situation

two funeral parlors ran out of 
coffins on wednesday and four more bodies were pulled from the 
waters by this grieving port town raising to 83 the number of 
people killed when a ferry sank on new years day 
the skipper of the craft has been jailed and president vinicio 
cerezos administration has ordered an investigation into the worst 
maritime tragedy in guatemalas history 
the justo rufino barrios ii evidently developed engine trouble 
halfway on a 16mile run from livingston to puerto barros 187 miles 
northeast of guatemala city 
a navy patrol boat came to its assistance and offered a tow but 
survivors said the cable was too short and the patrol boat sank the 
ferry when it suddenly accelerated 
survivors including the captain accused the crewmen of the 
naval craft of being drunk and swamping the craft navy officials 
insisted the ferry was overcrowded 
they are trying to put the blame on me so as to remain 
blameless themselves juan pablo esquivel the 22yearold ferry 
captain said in a jailhouse interview 
esquivel could face up to 10 years in prison for negligence in 
the disaster 
over 160 people including about 40 children were on the ferry 
when it went down according to officials here officials said its 
official capacity was 90 passengers 
four bodies were recovered from amatique bay on wednesday 
raising the death toll to 83 
none of the survivors interviewed alleged malice on the part of 
navy crew but esquivel who has been arrested on charges of 
criminal negligence said he doubted the navy would accept any 
responsibility 
esquivel interviewed tuesday night said the patrol boats crew 
was celebrating the new year on deck when it arrived to help the 
ferry 
they were in a state of drunkenness esquivel claimed he 
said a navy machinist who came on board the ferry to check the 
engine smelled strongly of alcohol 
isaac acevedo another survivor was quoted by the local 
newspaper as saying they the navy crewmen were drunk and gave 
us a very brusque pull 
capt anibal giron deputy commander of the puerto barrios naval 
base and a graduate of the us coast guard academy denied 
wednesday that anyone was drunk on the navy boat 
esquivel said he asked the patrol boat skipper to take on half 
his ferry passengers before beginning the tow but that the skipper 
denied the request giron said the approaching dusk and the 
difference in deck levels made a transfer impossible 
grieving townspeople continued showing up at la milagrosa and 
estrada the towns two funeral homes stands that normally hold 
varnished wooden caskets were bare and carpenters were building 
roughhewn pine coffins to meet the demand 
rodolfo lucano administrator of the ferry service said 150 
passengers was a safe load for the 60foot ferry 
esquivel said he was aware there were 100 adults but said more 
could have come on board without his knowledge 
even if it were overloaded that is not going to make it 
capsize what made it capsize was a a bad tow lucano said

officials in armenia and azerbaijan on wednesday 
appealed to refugees who fled ethnic violence to return home and 
promised severe punishment for those who instigated attacks that 
left at least 31 people dead 
throw aside all hesitations and doubts your neighbors 
friends comrades in work and study are waiting for you said a 
statement distributed by the tass news agency 
all those who encroached on the brotherhood of the people who 
expelled families persecuted people on account of their 
nationality will be punished in accordance with all the strictness 
of the law it said 
tass said the statement from the communist parties and 
governments of the neighboring southern republics was published 
wednesday in the official press 
according to official reports about 180000 people fled across 
the border to their ethnic homeland to escape the violence erupting 
in midnovember in the past month official reports have said that 
some of the refugees had returned home but no numbers have been 
given 
the appeal said the migration had attained enormous 
proportions 
both small republics have responsibility for feeding and housing 
refugees that is especially difficult for armenia which also is 
struggling with the effects of the dec 7 earthquake that devastated 
its northern cities 
the dispute between the republics began in february when 
armenians began agitating for annexation of the nagornokarabakh 
region of azerbaijan which is dominated by ethnic armenians 
violence has broken out several times since then and more than 
60 people are known to have been killed azerbaijan and central 
authorities in moscow have rejected armenias demand for annexation 
the government newspaper izvestia said wednesday that 75 criminal 
cases began in armenia before nov 22 and that 70 began after that 
date it said the later cases included murders assaults robberies 
and intentional destruction of personal property 
izvestia also said some local officials were fired for failing to 
keep the peace 
it said two police officers in the gugar region of armenia where 
eight azerbaijanis were killed in the most recent violence had been 
fired and a criminal investigation was under way against one of them

bradford university in northern england and london antiques dealer

to be in the soviet union was sentenced in 1962 to 42 years 
imprisonment in a highly publicized case the 42 years were for the 
42 british agents prosecutors said the dutchborn blake betrayed to 
their deaths 
blake escaped from londons wormwood scrubs prison after serving 
less than five years in a soviet television interview last april 
he said he hid in an apartment near the prison for a few days hid 
in another for two months and then was smuggled from britain to the 
soviet union by way of east berlin 
blake who married in the soviet union painted an idyllic 
picture of life in moscow 
the names of randle and pottle have been linked previously to the 
blake escape in newspaper stories but their book titled the 
blake escape how we freed george blake and why appears to promise 
the first full account 
camilla nicholls spokeswoman for the books british publishers 
harrap ltd said lawyers have told the company that publication is 
not illegal it is illegal to profit from criminal acts 
we are advised the writing of the book is not a criminal act 
said ms nicholls 
randle said he and pottle expected to be questioned by police 
we are prepared to go to jail if necessary he said we feel 
that our decision was a right one and we have always been prepared

the chief kremlin negotiator on 
afghanistan said wednesday he is not certain that soviet troops will 
withdraw on schedule if moslem guerrillas keep fighting the 
communist afghan regime 
under a unmediated agreement soviet soldiers began leaving 
afghanistan on may 15 1988 half were out by aug 15 and the 
remaining 50000 are to be gone by feb 15 the guerrillas not 
parties to the agreement have continued the war 
yuli vorontsov soviet deputy foreign minister and ambassador to 
afghanistan told reporters when he arrived in islamabad on 
wednesday 
if the ceasefire holds and there is no fighting in 
afghanistan then thats a very good situation for soviet forces to 
leave when asked what would happen to the withdrawal plans if the 
insurgency continued he said we shall see all of us i dont 
know 
guerrillas have rejected the sovietbacked governments offer of 
a coalition and are ignoring a unilateral ceasefire it proclaimed 
which began jan 1 
vorontsov is expected to meet insurgent leaders thursday in 
moscows search for a political solution to the civil war that began 
after a communist coup in april 1978 soviet soldiers entered 
afghanistan in december 1979 and totaled an estimated 115000 when 
the withdrawal agreement was signed april 14 in geneva 
the soviet envoy held meetings in saudi arabia a month ago with 
guerrilla leaders based in pakistan and conferred in tehran earlier 
this week with others based in iran 
about 55 million afghans onethird of the population have fled 
since the war began nearly all to pakistan and iran afghanistans 
neighbors on the east and west guerrillas use border towns and 
refugee camps as bases and supply points 
pakistan and the united states provide most of the insurgents 
arms and financial support 
guerrilla sources in islamabad said representatives of fighters 
operating from iran were expected to arrive thursday to join the 
talks with vorontsov 
vorontsov said he was prepared to meet with the guerrillas but 
they were not ready yet before i came here 
a guerrilla source said privately the resistance leaders from 
iran and pakistan probably would confer with each other before 
meeting vorontsov and whether they would see him jointly or 
separately had not been decided 
vorontsov is trying to work out arrangements that will allow all 
soviet forces to leave by the deadline without being attacked along 
the way the kremlin has acknowledged the loss of at least 13300 
soldiers in the war 
he met with foreign minister sahabzada yaqub khan soon after 
arrival but would not reveal the substance he told the associated 
press as he left the meeting the talks were very interesting and 
very useful and when asked to elaborate said we talked about 
ovietpakistan relations and afghanistan 
humayun khan of the foreign ministry told the ap both sides 
are trying to work toward a political solution 
western diplomats said tuesday that soviet troops were 
withdrawing from shindand and herat in western afghanistan they 
also said soviet civilian advisers were leaving kabul en masse and 
quoted afghan officials as saying the main red army departure from 
the capital would begin jan 15 
sibghatullah mojaddidi who took over jan 1 as chairman of the 
sevenparty guerrilla alliance based in pakistan told reporters 
tuesday he expected to meet vorontsov on friday but guerrilla 
sources say some alliance members want no more discussions with the 
soviets 
meeting with guerrilas is a tacit acknowledgment moscow is 
exploring a noncommunist alternative but vorontsov refused on 
wednesday to write off the kremlins allies in kabul as participants 
in a future government 
the ruling marxists will survive by all means but they are 
willing to participate in the creation of a broadbased 
government he said the government in kabul is led by president 
najib 
factions in the pakistanbased guerrilla alliance are divided on 
many issues but agree najibs regime cannot have a role in postwar 
afghanistan 
they contend his government will collapse without soviet military 
help but vorontsov called that a big mistake wishful 
thinking 
mojaddidi announced tuesday 400member council would convene 
within three weeks with the task of forming a transitional 
government

a soviet television news program on wednesday 
promised viewers a report on 17 armenian earthquake survivors 
surviving nearly a month under the rubble of a grain elevator but 
failed to show the story 
editors of vremya could not explain why the report 
apparently the same one denied a day earlier by soviet officials 
was not shown on the program 
seventeen people survived almost a month under the ruins of an 
elevator we expect a report about this announcer anna shatilova 
said at the beginning of the nightly news program which is watched 
by tens of millions of viewers 
in a report about the visit of leningrad communist party leader 
yuri solovyev to the earthquakedevastated city of leninakan 
vremya showed a brief picture of rescue worker sasha ivanov from 
leningrad 
today leningrad resident sasha ivanov who saved the lives of 
17 people as hundreds of his comrades from all corners of the 
soviet union was raising a new leninakan the report said 
it showed the young mustachioed ivanov for only a couple of 
seconds in a report of several minutes and said nothing about when 
or how he saved the people 
hundreds of people were pulled alive from the wreckage of 
leninakan and other cities following the dec 7 quake but the 
official tass news agency on tuesday quoted norik muradyan head of 
the relief effort in the devastated city of spitak as saying the 
last survivor had been rescued there 10 days ago 
the tass report was a denial of a story monday by a french radio 
station that 17 people had been rescued from a collapsed grain 
elevator in spitak it said they had survived for more than three 
weeks by eating grain and drinking melted snow 
vremya editors could not explain the confusion you saw 
everything on the screen that we received from yerevan said the 
duty editor in charge of the program 
the editor who spoke in a telephone conversation with the 
associated press on condition he not be identified said ms 
shatilovas announcement at the beginning of the program could have 
referred to the report about ivanov or that film crews in yerevan 
perhaps had not had enough time to put together a report 
editors at tass in moscow and at the official armenpress news 
agency in armenia said they had no information to verify that 17 
people were rescued from a collapsed elevator 
telephones at government offices and the red cross in yerevan did 
not answer wednesday night

congressional leaders said wednesday the united 
states acted appropriately in shooting down two libyan fighters as 
they accepted the reagan administrations denial that us forces 
planned to attack a purported libyan chemical weapons factory 
defense secretary frank carlucci told a pentagon news conference 
the commander of the f14 patrol made the decision to fire at the 
libyan aircraft in selfdefense and apparently shot down both 
planes 
carlucci also denied the two american f14s and their host 
aircraft carrier the uss john f kennedy were in the area with the 
intention of attacking the what the united states says is a chemical 
weapons factory 
members of the house and senate were nearly unanimous in their 
support for the us action and legislators emerging from afternoon 
briefings by the joint chiefs of staff expressed their satisfaction 
with the administrations explanation 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said the american jets were acting defensively because the libyan 
planes had maneuvered themselves into a position of attack and 
they did it on two occasions 
that violates the rules of engagement that we have common 
understanding on in the international environment nunn said 
you cannot in this day and time and modern technology wait until 
another plane has fired in order to defend yourself its too late 
then 
nunn who was contacted by adm william crowe chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff and later attended one of the briefings said 
he was reassured there was no connection between the incident and 
the chemical weapons plant 
ive talked to admiral crowe about that and ive gotten an 
emphatic no no connection in terms of what the american ship was 
doing nunn said the action took place 4550 miles away from 
shore it wasnt even in the approximate region of that chemical 
plant 
so from the american point of view everything i know 
indicates that there was no connection between what the ship or 
planes were doing and our concern about the chemical plant in 
libya he said 
rep les aspin chairman of the house armed services committee 
said that based on information from the briefing everything that 
weve done was appropriate 
aspin said he believes the administrations contention that us 
forces were conducting routine operations in the mediterranean sea 
and suggested that libyan leader moammar gadhafi provoked the 
incident 
gadhafi was looking for a little bit of a dustup with the 
united states aspin said 
house majority whip tony coelho dcalif said the information 
presently available indicates our pilots acted defensively and well 
within the rules of engagement 
congress should be informed however if the united states is 
engaged in a piecemeal escalation of our conflict with libya beyond 
these legitimate acts of selfdefense coelho said 
sen christopher dodd dconn a member of the foreign relations 
committee said the us pilots were provoked and they responded 
decisively and correctly 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said the american pilots had 
reason to believe they were under attack and they were acting in 
selfdefense 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said the downing of the 
two libyan jets the first battle between the united states and 
libya since american jets bombed tripoli in april 1986 appears to 
be selfdefense pure and simple 
gadhafi never learns dole said maybe this time he will 
finally get it straight whenever he threatens american forces we 
will defend ourselves 
libyas construction of a chemical weapons factory exacerbated 
the already volatile relationship between the united states and 
libya us officials said tuesday they had evidence the plant had 
started producing limited quantities of chemical weapons and has 
conducted trial runs of its production equipment 
libya has claimed the plant will make pharmaceuticals and offered 
to let international experts inspect the facility the united states 
claimed the offer was inadequate 
sen john mccain rariz a member of the armed services 
committee said early reports indicate that the us action was 
warranted in that when an aircraft locks onto another aircraft with 
its radar it then has the capability of launching a missile a 
radarguided missile 
sen alfonse damato rny said the american jets took the 
proper action and indicated that some us action against the 
chemical plant may be necessary 
under no circumstances would we countenance them letting the 
genie out of the bottle in terms of chemical warfare and if 
necessary we would destroy that facility damato told reporters 
in albany ny 
sen tim wirth dcolo a member of the armed services 
committee said the us jets were justified in defending themselves 
the technology involved in modern combat doesnt allow much 
time to verify an attack one missile fired from beyond visual 
range is all that is necessary to destroy a plane or ship wirth 
said 
in areas of high tension as in the gulf or near libya every 
action must be regarded as potentially harmful he said 
sen alan j dixon dill chairman of the armed services 
subcommittee on readiness sustainability and support said the 
united states did exactly what we should have done those of 
us who have looked into it approve of what occurred

washington ap the department of energy estimated wednesday it 
may take 91 billion to 200 billion over 60 years to clean up 
radioactive and chemical contamination at 45 government civilian and 
military nuclear plants around the country 
in a report to sen john glenn dohio the energy department 
said the work to be done includes cleaning up soil surface and 
ground water including removal treatment and disposal of bulk 
wastes 
glenn at a news conference urged the reagan and bush 
administrations to commit significant resources to the job 
chairman of the senate government affairs committee glenn said 
the situation at 17 nuclear facilities is so serious it represents 
nothing less than an environmental time bomb 
its up to the white house to ask for enough money to defuse 
that bomb before it explodes glenn said the acid test of our 
governments commitment to cleaning up these facilities does not lie 
in this report but in the amount of money that is actually budgeted 
and spent for cleanup 
campaign rhetoric promises and good intentions will not do the 
job he said weve waited too long already to start this job 
we simply cannot afford to wait any longer 
glenn said his committee will open hearings early in the year to 
examine the energy department report and two others soon to be 
issued 
they include a followup report on the cost of clean up at each 
specific nuclear site and the socalled 2010 study which is to 
examine goals for nuclear weapons production and facilities in the 
year 2010 
glenn said the latter reports should be issued over the next few 
weeks 
glenn said he is concerned that insufficient funds for the 
cleanup job will be included in the budget being prepared by the 
office of management and budget and added the main thing is will 
they have guts enough to put this in the new budget 
he said that he understands that omb is considering proposing 
spending of about 14 billion for the fiscal year beginning next 
oct 1 but asserted that it will take at least 18 billion to 
just keep up 
as far as im concerned 14 billion is completely 
inadequate he said 
glenn said that while spending in the magnitude of some 6 
billion a year is clearly called for he believes a good start can 
be made with a cleanup program costing 35 billion to 4 billion a 
year 
its not going to get any cheaper glenn said we know it 
has to be done lets get on with it

here is the official englishlanguage text 
of a libyan mission statement issued wednesday on the us downing 
of two libyan jets 
communique issued by the peoples committee of the peoples 
bureau for foreign liason 
this morning the united states of america launched a new and 
premeditated attack against the great jamahiriya american airplanes 
intercepted and downed two libyan reconnaissance airplanes which 
were on a routine mission over international waters 
this premeditated american aggression was preceded by reinforcing 
the 6th fleet in the mediterranean sea with the movement of huge 
naval military concenration comprising 13 naval vessels the nuclear 
airplane carrier roosevelt as well as a landing force consisting of 
12000 personnel it was also declared that those naval forces were 
sent to conduct maneuvers opposite libyan shores 
this naval military concentration was coupled with american 
threats to attack libya and destroy specific targets therein under 
pretexts and justifications that have been rejected and condemned by 
world public opinion 
this massive american military concentration in the mediterranean 
sea is only a smoke screen it cannot cloud the fact that should be 
clear to the world ie launching a widescale attack against the 
socialist peoples libyan arab jamahiriya that targets its military 
and economic installations 
the pretext of conducting routine maneuvers reinforces rather 
than weakens the american administrations decision to launch this 
attack this is underlined by the declarations and statements made 
by officials in the american administration which do not conceal 
their inclination to attack the jamahiriya under any circumstances 
and any pretexts 
in protesting against repeated attacks made against it by the 
american administration the socialist peoples libyan arab 
jamahiriya calls upon the international community its international 
and regional organizations and bodies to shoulder heir 
responsibilities and hasten to 
stop the maneuvers conducted by american opposite libyan shores 
and call for the withdrawal of the american naval military 
concentration which exists for aggressive purposes and not for 
conducting normal maneuvers as america claims 
shoulder the responsibility of the inernational community in 
halting this aggression against pacifist and peaceful people 
this aggression threatens peace in the mediterranean region as 
well as world peace and security 
in facing an unjust aggression made against it by a world 
superpower the libyan arab people reserves its legitimate right to 
defend itself and its existence

a federal judge on wednesday upheld the governments 
right to prosecute panamas military ruler general manuel antonio 
noriega on charges he turned his central american nation into a way 
station for cocaine traffickers 
us district judge william hoeveler rejected arguments by 
noriegas defense attorneys that as panamas de facto head of state 
noriega was immune from prosecution 
we have this material this poison being sent to us the 
judge said in a ruling from the bench after the twohour hearing 
to countenance sovereign immunity under these particular 
circumstances would be a serious error 
hoeveler noted the us state departments affidavit that noriega 
is not accepted as legal ruler of panama our government has said 
he is not and in fact has characterized him as kind of an outlaw 
head of state he said 
the judge refused to rule on two other issues raised by noriegas 
defense attorney neal sonnett 
the defense had argued noriega was being selectively prosecuted 
to force him into concessions on control of the panama canal which 
under treaty is to be turned over to the panamanian government at 
the end of the century 
sonnett also said in his motion for dismissal that pretrial 
publicity would make it impossible to find an objective jury 
the judge said those issues would have to wait until the case was 
ready to go to trial which both sides interpreted to mean when 
noriega was extradited to the united states 
us attorney dexter lehtinen conceded noriega would be 
difficult to extradite but said his regime could fall anytime 
hes on tenuous ground lehtinen said hes just a secondrate 
military commander an upstart who seized power in panama 
about 30 panamanian exiles in the courtroom audience crowded 
around prosecutors and later outside the courthouse cheered the 
announcement of hoevelers ruling 
the indictment accuses noriega and 15 others of working with 
colombias medellin cartel to smuggle cocaine into the united 
states alleging that the general provided protection and services 
to the traffickers 
following the february indictment the united states declared an 
economic blockade of panama and worked openly with noriegas 
domestic opposition to depose him but the effort failed at one 
point over the objections of miami prosecutors the united states 
offered to drop the indictment if noriega would resign 
the 12count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in miami 
accused noriega of accepting 46 million in bribes from the drug 
cartel a grand jury in tampa indicted noriega on three marijuana 
importation counts the next day 
chief deputy assistant us attorney richard gregorie initially 
sought to have the defense motion sealed for fear it might contain 
blackmail against the reagan administration but agreed to 
release the documents publicly when he found there was none noriega 
has claimed to have information in his files on presidentelect 
george bush 
sonnett said one foreign policy issue was pressure by 
conservatives in the reagan administration to renegotiate the panama 
canal treaty signed during the carter administration the treaty 
hands control of the waterway over to panama at the end of the 
century 
there were attempts to modify aspects of the treaty he said 
we argue that it was one of the circumstances leading up to a 
decision to attempt to get noriega out of power 
the motion contains quotes from the news media made by reagan 
administration officials such as assistant secretary of state 
elliott abrams that the defense says demonstrate the political 
nature of the case abrams is quoted as saying in may that the 
indictment drove noriega crazy and gave us a terrific bargaining 
tool 
the defense calling the case against noriega indictment 
diplomacy noted that in march the government offered to guarantee 
it would not seek his extradition if he fled to spain and in may 
offered to drop the indictments altogether if he left panama

libya claimed the destruction of two libyan jet 
fighters by us navy planes on wednesday was a premeditated attack 
and col moammar gadhafi declared his nation would meet challenge 
with challenge 
if america has prevailed because it is a superpower in the air 
and the sea it will inevitably be defeated on land gadhafi said 
we as well as the fish are awaiting them 
gadhafi asked the soviet union to move some of its warships in 
the mediterranean to the area in which us vessels are operating 
near libya the official yugoslav news agency tanjug reported from 
tripoli the libyan capital 
tanjug reported later that tripoli residents jammed filling 
stations in a flight from the city a few hours after the aerial 
encounter 
tanjugs correspondent one of the few nonarab journalists with 
an office in tripoli has had excellent access to high libyan 
sources in the past and his reports often prove reliable 
a reporter for italian tv said gadhafis residenceheadquarters 
in tripoli already equipped with watchtowers and tanks parked in 
camouflaged garages had been even more heavily fortified 
the italian correspondent who arrived in tripoli on wednesday 
said antimissile batteries had been placed in key areas he said 
the government television station was one point at which security 
was notably greater 
he described the reaction as first incredulity then anger 
when word arrived in tripoli that fighters from the us 6th fleet 
had shot down two libyan mig jets 
gadhafis compound was a target of the last us military strike 
against libya bombing raids in april 1986 on tripoli and benghazi 
president reagan described the raids as retaliation for the bombing 
of a berlin disco frequented by american servicemen which the 
united states blamed on terrorists sponsored by libya 
wednesday evening the libyan foreign ministry summoned heads of 
western european diplomatic missions and asked them to condemn the 
us aggression and to prevent any escalation in tensions the 
official libyan news agency jana reported 
gadhafi according to jana branded the us action on wednesday 
as an example of increased official american terrorism which is 
backed by brute force 
in spite of it and of the threats the revolutionaries of great 
libya will not bow their heads and will not abandon their principles 
and the objectives of their eternal motherland of unity liberation 
and the building of progress he declared 
they will meet challenge with challenge he said 
in new york libyan ambassador ali sunni muntasser requested an 
emergency meeting of the un security council to condemn this 
premeditated act of aggression in shooting down two aircraft that 
were unarmed on reconnaissance ordinary routine flying 
earlier in the day libyas ambassador to rome linked the event 
to us charges that libya had built a chemical weapons factory in 
the desert southwest of tripoli in washington the state department 
said there was absolutely no connection 
gadhafi has said the plants function is to produce medicines 
jana reported in recent days that libyan doctors and nurses were 
conducting a sitin at the factory anticipating a us attack 
the agency quoted the foreign ministry as describing us naval 
presence in the mediterranean as a smokescreen for a 
largescale aggression to be launched against libyan military 
and economic installations 
libya preserves its legitimate right to defend itself and its 
existence jana quoted the ministry as saying it said the 
ministry had asked for an emergency meeting of foreign ministers 
from arab league nations 
libyan state radio carried this foreign ministry statement 
earlier wednesday 
at 1103 hours 503 am est while two libyan reconnaissance 
aircraft were carrying out a patrol over international waters us 
aircraft carried out a premeditated attack on them and shot them 
down 
abdel rahman shalgam the libyan ambassador to italy said the 
us navy action was dangerous but did not say how libya would 
respond his embassy issued a statement wednesday evening calling it 
an act of destabilizing provocation for all the mediterranean 
area 
it is an incomprehensible provocation the statement said 
and libya asks for the solidarity of the mediterranean area 
peoples recognizing especially the role played by italy in 
international peacemaking 
giulio andreotti italys foreign minister has recommended that 
allegations about the chemical factory be discussed at an 
international conference on chemical weapons beginning saturday in 
paris

israeli soldiers killed a 16yearold boy 
wednesday and wounded five other palestinians hospital officials 
reported and leftwing legislators said they would defy israeli law 
and meet with plo officials 
a palestinian man was shot dead in jericho in the occupied west 
bank but it was not clear whether the killing was connected with 
the 13monthold uprising in the occupied territories 
conferences are planned in paris and the hague later this month 
despite israeli laws that prohibit meetings with the palestine 
liberation organization 
a palestinian newspaper and israeli magazine announced plans 
wednesday for a similar meeting in new york in march to which 
members of israels parliament and the palestine national council 
the plo legislature would be invited

palestinians killed in the rebellion fourteen israelis also have 
died 
in jericho 25yearold bassam barahme was killed by unidentified 
gunmen near his home wednesday night army officials and israel 
radio reported 
barahme was taken to mukassad hospital in arab east jerusalem and 
died of two bullet wounds the radio said 
the reason for the attack was not known a military official 
said troops were not involved it was a clash between residents 
the uprising has been credited with bringing about a more 
moderate stance by plo chairman yasser arafat that has in turn 
encouraged some israelis to press for a talks with the plo 
arafat said wednesday his peace overtures to israel would be 
withdrawn unless it agreed to negotiate 
i dont expect israel to accept peace easily or to give in 
easily he said during a rally in cairo after a meeting with 
president hosni mubarak of egype 
but if israel continues to spurn talks i will return to the 
palestine national council and tell them its no use these people 
israelis do not want peace 
in jerusalem lova eliav of israels mainstream labor party said 
wednesday that he and five other israeli politicians would attend 
the meetings with plo officials 
i think the israeli government must negotiate with the plo and 
the meetings in the hague and paris can be a catalyst for future 
meetings he said 
organizers of the hague meeting said they believed the plo would 
be represented by two top officials bassam abu sharif and khaled al 
hassan 
eliav said he and and fellow labor party member ora namir would 
go to paris along with yair tsaban of the socialist mapam party and 
shulamit aloni of the leftwing citizens rights movement all are 
members of israels parliament 
he said abba eban a former labor foreign minister and haim 
tzadok a former supreme court justice would attend the hague 
meeting 
the hebrewlanguage hadashot newspaper also reported an 
unidentified labor legislator was trying to arrange a meeting with 
arafat in paris 
meanwhile palestinian editor hanna seniora said his plobacked 
newspaper al fajr and the israeli magazine new outlook would sponsor 
a meeting march 1820 in new york to bring palestinians and israelis 
together 
after arafat said dec 14 in geneva that the plo recognized 
israels right to exist and renounced terrorism the united states 
opened meetings with the plo but israeli officials continue to 
denounce arafats organization as a terrorist group 
a foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday that the ministry 
asked israeli legislators not to attend the meetings a group of 31 
rightwing and religious party lawmakers also asked government 
officials to legally block those going to paris from leaving israel 
an army official said the military was investigating the death of 
an 11yearold palestinian who family members charge suffered a 
fatal head injury when he was pushed off a military jeep on dec 10 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said there was 
no evidence that the boy badr karadeh of nablus was ever in 
military custody 
but a palestinian physician dr abdel hadi abu zant of nablus 
said he saw the boy seized beaten and taken away by israeli 
soldiers in a jeep 
two leftwing members of parliament dedi zucker and yossi sarid 
of the citizens rights movement have called for a defense ministry 
probe 
in another development mayor elias freij of the west bank town 
of bethlehem who proposed a truce in the uprising appeared to be 
in hiding wednesday after a warning from arafat and death threats 
painted on the town walls 
freij had proposed conditions under which israel would free 5000 
palestinian prisoners allow universities to open and hold 
municipal elections for the first time in 12 years 
arafat in remarks broadcast monday said no one can stop the 
intefadeh and any responsible palestinian calling for stopping it 
exposes himself to the bullets of our people

mayor art agnos on wednesday defended as 
lowkeyed and responsible a sweep of up to 50 homeless people 
from a campsite of tarpaulins and plastic sheets near city hall 
the evictions tuesday followed complaints the homeless camp was 
blocking access to a building about a dozen police officers watched 
as public works employees removed the shelters a garbage truck used 
in the eviction was emblazoned with the slogan the sweep is on 
the campers moved voluntarily when requested to do so and were 
given ample time to collect their belongings said agnos the 
homeless problem was created by federal policies that reduced the 
amount of local housing aid by 80 percent over then past eight 
years no city can make up for that 
agnos has refused to open a national guard armory to the 
homeless saying it is too small and would be too expensive to run 
but four days before the sweep he asked local religious leaders to 
make churches and synagogues available 
the encampment in un plaza in view of city hall was set up a 
few days earlier dozens of men and women spent the holidays in the 
encampment using sleeping bags plastic sheets tarps and blankets 
to ward off the rain and cold as a series of storms struck northern 
california 
pacific gas and electric complained to police that the shelters 
were blocking a fire exit company officials said 
right now we probably look like the bad guys said pgampe 
spokeswoman cynthia schramm but we have a lot of sympathy for 
these people we only wanted the police to unblock a fire door 
police sgt dave ambrose said the operation was not a police 
action the san francisco police stood by while the department of 
public works took apart the temporary structures 
earl thompson who helped start the tent community refused to 
leave and was arrested others who built their tent shacks on the 
plaza wandered away but vowed to move back 
james robinson 32 said he didnt know where he would head next 
it depends on how far they beat us back he said 
on tuesday katherine baker an organizer of the tent city stood 
a few yards away as dpw crews hosed down the bricks where the 
homeless had been she stood near a pile of blankets and shopping 
carts that had once been the community house 
she said they had banded together for selfprotection against 
theft or worse 
if were scattered weve got the robbers and night creepers 
wanting to come by and mess you up she said we got nowhere 
else to go the hotels arent safe the shelters are packed 
they treat us like tramps said baker and its hard 
every damn day how long can one human being keep taking that from 
another human being 
the city houses about half of san franciscos estimated 6000 
homeless in budget hotels bob prentice coordinator of the mayors 
homeless program said the city has been trying to find another 
building that can be used as a temporary shelter 
were doing the best we can to get a place for them he said 
until then they have to keep a low profile

a united nations refugee expert visiting 
the southern tip of texas said wednesday she has seen hundreds of 
central american emigrants camping in makeshift tents and crowded 
into dilapidated motels 
clearly these people are experiencing difficulty and hardship 
and this is one thing i wanted to come down and see about said 
susan timberlake of the washington dc office of the un high 
commissioner for refugees 
ms timberlake arrived in the lower rio grande valley on tuesday 
night and planned to stay until thursday visiting immigrant shelters 
and meeting with local officials and immigration and naturalization 
service representatives 
ms timberlake said as of wednesday she had not observed any 
apparent violations of international law 
al de leon assistant ins district director for examinations in 
harlingen said no violations of un protocol were relayed to him 
in his meeting with ms timberlake 
basically she is down here to observe and learn about the 
situation he said 
more than 30000 central americans have crossed the rio grande 
illegally near brownsville and sought political asylum since the end 
of may when the ins started keeping count of the growing flood of 
other than mexican newcomers 
the concentration of central americans in the valley has 
increased sharply since dec 16 when the ins started requiring 
asylumseeking immigrants in the area to submit their applications 
at the ins harlingen office and to receive word of approval or 
denial here 
the un refugee offices interest in cameron county the states 
southernmost was not a result of the new ins procedure but by 
the fact that there are large numbers of asylumseekers here and 
thats what the un is interested in said ms timberlake 
the office of the high commissioner for refugees based in 
geneva was established to protect refugees rights more than 100 
countries have subscribed to a 1951 convention andor a 1967 
protocol relating to the status of refugees each defines who is a 
refugee and outlines proper conditions for handling refugees 
much of the un language was incorporated into us law with the 
1980 refugee act refugees are defined in part as people who are 
outside their country because of wellfounded fear of persecution 
when i go back ill discuss what ive seen with my office and 
with my headquarters in geneva and well sit down with the us 
government and discuss it ms timberlake said 
a main concern of the un body is whether refugees have adequate 
access to the asylum process she said 
asylumseekers previously were allowed to travel to their 
destination cities usually miami or los angeles a huge backlog of 
asylum cases in those cities and a large number of unwarranted 
asylum claims prompted the ins to adopt the new procedure officials 
said 
ins officials have said most of the applicants are seeking 
economic betterment not fleeing persecution and therefore do not 
qualify for asylum those denied asylum will be asked to leave the 
country or face deportation but may appeal their cases 
because there is at least a 30day wait for an answer from the 
ins many of the immigrants with no money and no place to go have 
begun camping out in the brush under discarded sheets of plastic 
a shanty town of plastic roofs continues to grow outside the 
catholic churchsponsored casa oscar romero shelter for central 
americans southeast of brownsville casa romero is limited to a 
capacity of 200 by court order 
ms timberlake said she had visited that camp site dotted with 
human feces where 250 people stayed tuesday night and the amber 
motel a condemned structure in brownsville that remains packed with 
central americans

is one of many children who need help but cannot get it because 
there are not enough resources to go around 
roger raymond biddefords special education director said he 
contacted the state department of human services two months ago 
because he feared scott was at risk 
its terrible what happened raymond said it goes without 
saying we dont have the resources available for kids who are in 
need of such services and i doubt that his situation is unique 
after a threehour detention hearing tuesday district court 
judge robert crowley found probable cause for a felony murder charge 
stemming from the fire death of raymond r lauzon assistant 
attorney general eric wright said the boy must appear jan 17 in 
district court 
felony murder is a homicide that occurs during the commission of 
a felony in this case arson in which someones death is a 
reasonably foreseeable result 
should scott be tried as a juvenile and convicted he could 
remain in the custody of the state until he is 21 or 22 years old 
if tried for murder as an adult he would face a minimum of 25 years 
in prison and a maximum life term 
at tuesdays hearing scotts 8yearold brother jason told the 
court that the two boys had been visiting lauzon and were told to 
leave when the older boy was caught trying to steal money from 
lauzons bedroom 
jason said he walked away but scott lingered around the apartment 
building before joining him later 
in interviews and court testimony juvenile caseworkers school 
officials and scotts mother janet sullivan portrayed him as an 
emotionally troubled youngster who had been placed in three special 
schools but remained uncontrollable 
for the past three months he had run away about once a week from 
ms sullivan 31 who is divorced jobless and on welfare according 
to testimony 
a spokesman at the department of human services said scotts 
problems were not so severe that he needed to be placed in a foster 
home or residential treatment center

slashing the number of un peacekeeping troops in 
namibia will give south africa an opportunity to maintain control 
over the territory a rebel leader warned on wednesday 
rebel leader sam nujoma ripped a move by un security council 
members to reduce from 7500 to 3000 the contingent that will 
oversee namibias transition this year to independence from south 
africa 
this obviously is unacceptable unjust and undemocratic 
nujoma told a news conference it is an attempt to assist south 
africa to achieve politically what it failed to achieve militarily 
he said a un force of 3000 wont be able to control 
anything given the scope of namibias 800000squaremile 
territory 
instead of reducing the transition force nujoma said the united 
nations should increase it to ensure that the transition to 
independence and black majority rule is carried out peacefully and 
without south african interference 
the proposal for a reduction in the 7500member force was based 
on financial considerations 
nujoma who leads the rebel southwest africa peoples 
organization said the united states was one of those who supported 
the reduction plan he did not name the other nations that supported 
it 
two weeks ago south africa agreed to implement a un plan for 
namibias transition to independence as part of the deal cuba 
agreed to withdraw its 50000 troops from namibias northern 
neighbor angola 
south africa will be allowed to keep a residual force of 1500 
troops in namibia until an independent government takes power but 
nujoma expressed concern about alleged south african efforts to 
continue influencing events in the territory 
among other things he said antiindependence death squads 
operate in namibia 
nujoma was in cuba for talks with president fidel castro and to 
take part in activities related to the 30th anniversary of the cuban 
revolution 
namibia also is known as southwest africa

dolphins saved the life of a 17yearold 
boy who was attacked by a large shark while surfing off the north 
coast of new south wales state police said the shark tore a huge 
chunk from the boys surfboard 
police said a group of dolphins chased off the shark that 
attacked adam mcguire on tuesday at evans head about 400 miles 
north of sydney 
mcguire from newcastle about 100 miles north of sydney 
suffered a badly cut abdomen in the attack police and ambulance 
officers said 
he swam to shore despite his injuries and raised the alarm 
ambulance officers attended mcguire and rushed him to a hospital 
where he underwent surgery and was in stable condition 
police said mcguire was surfing about 300 feet or more off half 
tide beach with two friends when a shark believed to be a tiger 
shark attacked him twice 
on the first pass the shark gouged out a big piece of his 
surfboard and knocked him into the water 
sydney shark expert john hajje said mcguire probably could thank 
his surfboard as much as the dolphins for his survival 
the police told me that when the shark attacked it took a chunk 
out of the board and he fell off he said 
rather than attack him it kept on going for the board it 
really just brushed him and didnt take much of a bite 
hajje said it was not the first time he heard of dolphins 
intervening in a shark attack although he had yet to confirm the 
details of this incident 
dolphins are highly intelligent creatures and it certainly 
wouldnt be beyond them to know when a humans in distress and help 
out he said

the nicaraguan government sharply 
devalued the official currency exchange rate raised bus fares 
20000 percent and increased fuel prices wednesday in an effort to 
keep the economy afloat 
the economy is so battered after eight years of war against 
ussupported rebels that inflation last year topped 20000 
percent according to official figures 
the austerity measures were published in the sandinista party 
newspaper barricada they include an immediate devaluation of the 
cordoba of more than half in relation to the us dollar a 20000 
percent increase in bus fares and a raise in fuel prices of about 
120 percent 
on saturday president daniel ortega said in a new years speech 
he was cutting the defense budget by 29 percent which includes a 40 
percent cut for police and other security forces 
government spending on public works projects and other essential 
investments are being reduced this year by 56 percent ortega said 
the sandinistas have maintained strict controls over business and 
other economic activities since they seized power from a 
proamerican rightist government in 1979 the government sets prices 
for all essential goods and services from gasoline to bread and 
milk 
barricada said the central bank nicaraguas federal reserve on 
wednesday raised the official exchange parity from 920 to 2000 
cordobas to the dollar that is the rate the government uses for 
essential imports such as crude oil 
a parallel exchange rate at which most transactions such as 
paying hotel bills are carried out remained at 4500 to the dollar 
the black market rate is approximately 5500 to the dollar although 
it is not very large 
urban bus fares went up from half a cordoba to 100 cordobas or 
one 9000th of a us cent to a little over 2 cents the government 
has been heavily subsidizing bus fares to keep them low 
similarly the price of gasoline went up from 1900 cordobas to 
4200 cordobas a gallon or from about 42 cents to about 95 cents a 
gallon gasoline is rationed and motorists now get 17 gallons a 
month 
buses and other public means of transportation are in a shambles 
for lack of spare parts because of the usimposed trade embargo 
the united states said nicaragua had established close military ties 
with cuba and the soviet union 
nicaragua gets weapons training and other military assistance 
from soviet block countries the reagan administration has been 
claiming these ties together with alleged sandinista aid to leftist 
guerrillas in el salvador are a threat to security in central 
america 
as a result nicaragua now mainly trades with the soviet bloc 
with which it runs a big deficit imports last year totalled 800 
million while exports earned only 200 million 
ortega has said the trade embargo alone cost nicaragua 315 
million in income since the united states imposed it in 1985 and 
another 422 million in credits which the sandinistas were refused 
because of us pressure on world lending institutions

investigators believe the cyanide poisoning 
of a teenager is an isolated incident but said wednesday they were 
looking into a possibility it may be linked to an unsolved tampering 
case of two years ago 
the last known death or injury in new jersey from product 
tampering was in september 1986 when a runnemede man died after 
eating a small amount of soup that contained cyanide 
in both cases the tampered products were purchased at 
supermarkets but the tainted goods were manufacturerd by different 
companies said camden county prosecutor samuel asbell 
obviously we have to look into whether or not theres a 
connection said asbell adding that investigators have not found 
such evidence asbell said he knew of no motive or suspects 
us food and drug administration inspectors meanwhile toured 
the kraft inc dairy group plant that produced the tainted breyers 
black cherry yogurt in south edmeston ny officials said 
we havent seen anything that would indicate any problem 
there said fda spokesman william grigg in rockville md 
fda commissioner dr frank e young has said the incident appears 
to be an isolated case grigg said 
kraft inc dairy group meanwhile voluntarily added new york 
state wednesday to three other states where all flavors of breyers 
yogurt is being removed from retail stores 
we are taking this step to remove any doubt in consumers minds 
about the integrity of the product company president thomas 
herskovits said in a news release 
thomas lee 17 of haddonfield lapsed into a coma after eating 
about a third of an 8ounce container lee remained on a respirator 
at west jersey hospitalvoorhees late wednesday said spokesman ed 
kanis 
investigators also planned to look again at the carton in which 
the yogurt was packaged 
we need to go back and take a closer look said matthew 
lewis an fda district supervisor in west orange were all trying 
to find out where this happened right now we dont have any 
leads 
lewis said initial inspections of the carton and package lid 
revealed no pinholes the company has said breyers yogurt packages 
have a seal that makes any tampering evident asbell said there was 
no immediate evidence the seal had been broken 
the number one question here is when and where the 
contamination occurred said john h kundts an fbi spokesman in 
philadelphia 
breyers yogurt products have been removed as a precaution from 
167 acme stores in southern new jersey pennsylvania and delaware 
said walter rubel a spokesman for the malvern pabased chain 
the yogurt containing the cyanide was purchased sunday at a 
westmont acme supermarket from a yogurt batch dated feb 9 1989 
officials said 
marilyn riley a spokeswoman for the new jersey department of 
health said state officials were cautioning consumers who called to 
carefully inspect any products for tampering 
but lewis said tests tuesday on 130 similar yogurt containers 
turned up no sign of cyanide which is used in rat poisoning and can 
be fatal to humans 
authorities said the cyanide appeared to have been on the top of 
the yogurt and not stirred in 
the yogurt was in one of 6900 cases each with a dozen 
containers routed through a kraft facility in walton ny said 
mary agnes welsh a spokeswoman for kraft inc dairy group of 
glenview ill 
george kerns a spokesman for asbell said lees mother had 
purchased a batch of yogurt from the store and two other containers 
had been eaten without any side effects 
lee a junior at haddonfield memorial high school became ill 
tuesday morning when he was eating the yogurt on his way to class

the shooting death of a couple a few 
feet from their adoptive babys crib has meant a second chance for 
the 18yearold biological mother who said wednesday she is ready 
now to raise the child 
tracy medeiros successfully fought to regain custody of travis 
the son she gave up at birth nine months ago 
as she prepared him for a trip home to massachusetts she met 
wednesday with social service workers attended a parenting class 
here and talked with a child psychologist 
now i know im ready ive grown up a lot said medeiros 
shes a gutsy little kid shes young and thats the big thing 
against her said her attorney barbara rohan shes determined 
to do it shes really determined 
pregnant at 17 medeiros decided to give up the baby after her 
boyfriend left her a former boyfriend introduced medeiros to his 
cousin tasia stephens and her husband william of novato 
married for 15 years and owners of successful hair salons and 
video stores tasia 43 and william 45 wanted desperately to 
adopt a baby 
the young mothertobe and the stephenses grew close medeiros 
stayed at a home for teenage mothers in nearby santa rosa during 
her pregnancy she and the couple chose the babys name together and 
the couple was present at his birth 
the stephenses paid her medical and travel expenses and kept the 
baby even though the formal adoption process was delayed by a 
backlog of cases medeiros planned to visit the baby and the 
stephenses during the yearend holidays 
then novato police called her in massachusetts to say the 
stephenses had been found shot to death in their bed dec 14 
travis hungry but unharmed was found in his crib where he had 
been unattended for at least 24 hours authorities estimated 
suddenly medeiros said the safe secure future she arranged for 
her son was uncertain 
my world was totally crushed she said i thought what am 
i going to do with the baby i thought i love him i want him to 
be with me 
a marin county judge placed the baby in a foster home and 
medeiros petitioned for custody relatives of the stephenses argued 
that returning travis to his biological mother wasnt in his best 
interest 
on tuesday superior court juvenile commissioner sylvia shapiro 
ruled the adoption wasnt final and medeiros was still the babys 
legal parent the custody agreement requires medeiros to take 
parenting classes and make monthly reports about the childs welfare 
so the case can be reviewed in six months 
as medeiros prepared for the trip home the stephenses 
housekeeper and her boyfriend yolanda segura and zohelin diaz both 
25yearold guatamalans were arraigned on charges of murder police 
said they know of no motives 
rohan said experts believe travis was old enough at the time of 
the slayings to be real affected by what happened to him so 
meetings with a child psychologist can help medeiros detect signs of 
emotional problems 
medeiros lives with her mother in bellerica mass and works at 
a state institution for the retarded she has arranged fulltime 
child care so she can continue working 
at the time of the adoption i was doing what i thought was 
best for him now im doing whats best for him again medeiros 
said adding that she was so scared during the hearing that she 
didnt speak 
i never really wanted to give him up in the first place she 
said 
rohan said medeiros at first was frightened by the new situation 
by the prospect of failure and by media attention but the lawyer 
said she detected a growing closeness between mother and child 
hes a sweet friendly little baby he really is hes 
obviously been very loved rohan said i think hes starting to 
get to know her 
sebastopol attorney allison pharis who handled the adoption 
said medeiros will be your basic hardworking single mother 
trying to make it the stephenses relatives now want an amicable 
relationship with her she said

the losing side in a bitter contest among 
democrats for state senate majority leader on wednesday stripped the 
winner of most of his powers with the help of the small republican 
minority 
nineteen supporters of sen john j bevilacqua joined seven of 
the chambers nine republicans to take charge on the second day of 
the 1989 session 
sen david r carlin jr who defeated bevilacqua for the 
majority leadership by a 2219 vote of senate democrats in november 
was stripped of most of his formal powers including the right to 
name committee chairmen and control the flow of business on the 
floor 
the bevilacqua forces elected their own slate of committee 
chairmen but agreed to accommodate some requests from carlin 
backers for particular committee assignments bevilacqua retained 
his position as judiciary committee chairman 
the republicans who have been badly outnumbered in the rhode 
island senate for most of the past 50 years won the right for the 
minority leader to unilaterally force bills to a vote 
we did what we had to do said minority whip ann h hanson 
look at this as a political coup thats what it was we didnt 
ask for it it came to us 
carlin and bevilacqua avidly sought the support of the 
republicans who held the votes necessary to give one side or the 
other a majority of the senates 50 members the major changes 
wednesday were adopted 2624 
both sides offered similar concessions but hanson said 
bevilacquas offer was earlier and more specific 
in an occasionally heated debate carlins supporters charged 
bevilacqua was seeking revenge for the nasty tone of the campaign 
for the majority leadership 
he didnt deserve to win and he doesnt know how to lose 
charged sen william c oneill 
bevilacqua said after the debate that he would seek peace with 
carlin but would also ask to be included in some of the majority 
leaders traditional prerogatives such as representing the senate 
in budget negotiations with the house and the governor 
we will not interfere or create roadblocks bevilacqua said 
the peoples business comes first 
carlin would not comment on bevilacquas demand but said the 
senate as a whole would be weakened by the conflict 
instead of one voice who can speak effectively for the senate 
we now have three factions he said 
bevilacqua and republican leaders said they did not plan to 
continue their alliance by working together on legislation this 
is not a marriage this is a long weekend at the very most hanson 
said

keebler co bowing to consumer concerns 
about cholesterol announced wednesday it will eliminate certain 
oils from its keeblerbrand cookies crackers and snack foods 
the action follows similar announcements by pepperidge farm inc 
and other manufacturers who were prodded by a group called national 
heart savers 
in addition to removing tropical oils and lard from its products 
keebler said it would begin listing nutritional values on packages 
of its products 
tropical oils made with products like coconut or palm kernels 
and lard are high in saturated fats which can be converted by the 
body into arteryblocking cholesterol 
were extremely proud to respond to consumer concerns about 
these ingredients by replacing them with more healthful oils said 
thomas m garvin keebler president and chief executive officer 
keebler said its products refashioned with vegetable oils which 
are lower in saturated fat should begin appearing on store shelves 
in march 
by the end of 1989 no keebler product will contain tropical oil 
lard or beef fat said stuart greenblatt a keebler spokesman 
greenblatt said reformulating the food products would not affect 
consumer prices 
last week pepperidge farm inc promised to remove tropical oils 
from its products including its popular original goldfish 
crackers due to consumer health concerns 
kellog co announced dec 12 that it had stopped using tropical 
oils in its cracklin oat bran cereal sunshine biscuits inc 
announced nov 16 that it would remove palm oil and palm kernel from 
cookie and cracker products 
phil sokolof founder of national heart savers says tropical 
oils have been popular among food manufacturers because they help 
extend the shelf life of food products 
the 65yearold nebraska multimillionaire placed advertisements 
in newspapers in october criticizing manufacturers for advertising 
specific products as healthy or cholesterolfree when they are 
poisoning americans with saturated fats 
cholesterol is a form of fat contained in many foods that is 
deposited in artery linings doctors have said oils high in 
saturated fat cause the body to produce more cholesterol than it 
needs resulting in blockages and hardening of the arteries and 
increased risk of heart disease 
keebler headquartered in this western chicago suburb employs 
more than 8000 people nationwide and said its annual sales measure 
more than 1 billion

a rookie sheriffs deputy slain with her own gun 
wednesday at the dallas county jail had urged more handson 
training for county law enforcment officers 
deputy suzanne kays 33 was on her second day of work when she 
was killed by a man at the lew sterrett justice center who was 
released 24 hours early apparently due to a clerical error city 
manager richard knight said 
the suspect identified as alfonzo seward is thought to have 
taken the deputys gun after decking her with a punch and shot her 
several times at pointblank range 
in a memorandum to the city council knight said seward had been 
released early due to a clerical error and that the employee 
involved has been placed on paid administrative leave pending 
further investigation 
knight could not be located for comment late wednesday afternoon 
the shooting came less than a week after kays in evaluating her 
training recommended that county law enforcement officers receive 
more handson training 
kays in a statement dated dec 29 was mildly critical of the 
amount of training she received although she praised the quality of 
academy instructors and small class size 
the handson training and practicals i feel are a very 
important part of a peace officers training and i feel could have 
benefited more with extra time spent on these areas she wrote 
our class was small just 6 i really do not feel i could have 
benefitted as much as i have if i had been in a larger class with 
less time allowed in some areas 
lt jack watson commander of the training academy could not be 
reached for comment on kays evaluation of the county program which 
is required from all recruits after they complete the more than 600 
hours of training that spans 17 weeks 
the shooting suspect who was wounded by police gunfire has been 
known to use at least three names and listed his address as a dallas 
rescue mission and a restaurant where he was arrested police said 
the suspect who has identified himself on previous occasions as 
alfonso seward alfonso steward and alfonso stewart had been 
released from jail less than eight hours before the slaying which 
occurred shortly after 1 am wednesday 
the 37yearold suspect who has claimed to be both from oklahoma 
and arkansas was in serious condition at parkland memorial hospital 
with shotgun wounds in his legs and groin 
he has been charged with capital murder and is being held without 
bail he also is being held for investigation of attempted capital 
murder and attempted murder 
the slaying was the first at a dallas jail since jack ruby shot 
accused presidential assassin lee harvey oswald to death nov 24 
1963 in the basement of the dallas city jail authorities said 
oswald had been arrested two days earlier in the shooting of 
president john f kennedy 
kays who was single was born in cincinnati ohio and served in 
the army from may 1975 to january 1979 she joined the sheriffs 
department in december 1981 as a detention service officer 
kays was the first dallas county law enforcement officer to die 
in the line of duty since a deputy was killed while investigating a 
burglary in 1982 her death was the first slaying of a law 
enforcement officer in dallas this year

president fidel castro offered a ringing 
endorsement of the policies of the soviet union on wednesday night 
seemingly putting to rest suggestions of disagreements in 
sovietcuban relations 
in a speech broadcast live on radio marking the 30th anniversary 
of his revolution castro also bitterly criticized us policies 
toward libya and other third world countries prompting a walkout by 
the chief us diplomat in havana jay taylor 
castro spoke for nearly three hours before a crowd of tens of 
thousands at the site of a huge new exhibit commemorating the social 
and economic achievements of the revolution over the past three 
decades 
in several speeches in recent months castro has made clear his 
unhappiness with the marketoriented reform policies of soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev indicating concern cuba may have 
difficulties as a result 
but wednesday night castro dismissed sovietcuban differences as 
almost inconsequential and he praised the kremlins policies on 
peace and disarmament and said the two countries also see eyetoeye 
on the problem of international debt 
he also noted moscow has been a staunch ally of the cuban 
revolution during times of relative tranquillity and also when 
castros experiment has been under threat from the united states 
we support the policies of peace of the soviet union castro 
said he referred specifically to gorbachevs efforts to reduce the 
risks of nuclear war 
castro criticized a threat by the reagan administration to 
destroy a chemical weapons plant it claims libya has built 
castro said the united states has the most powerful chemical 
weapons arsenal in the world and he asked why should it deny that 
right to others 
shortly afterwards taylor walked out of the ceremony in apparent 
protest over castros remarks 
castro made no direct reference to the incident wednesday in 
which us fighter planes downed two libyan warplanes off the libyan 
coast 
castro was interrupted a number of times by applause from the 
huge crowd which gathered in late afternoon in an area adjacent to 
exhibition highlighting the achievements of the revolution that 
toppled dictator fulgencio batista on jan 1 1959 
the exhibition in south havana near lenin park includes about 45 
outdoor exhibits portraying cuban advances in such fields as nuclear 
energy agriculture and other endeavors 
castro made an appearance jan 1 in the east coast city of 
santiago which he regards as the cradle of the revolution because 
of its progressive heritage 
many of those attending took part in the work brigades which 
constructed the exhibit known as expocuba 
among the dignitaries sharing the platform with castro were 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega namibian rebel leader sam nujoma 
and czechoslovak communist party leader milos jakes

tim dunigan was an interested onlooker when 
the television series lucas tanner about a former baseball 
player turned teacher was filmed near his home 
they filmed some of it in webster groves mo where i grew 
up said dunigan i was interested because i wanted to be a 
baseball player i never thought about acting 
nevertheless dunigan did begin acting at webster college in st 
louis he soon joined the st louis repertory co 
last year dunigan won out over more than 1000 actors for the 
role of the new davy crockett in nbcs the magical world of 
disney the role was originated by fess parker in the frontierland 
segment of disneyland in 195455 
the latest chapter will be seen sunday jan 15 crockett who 
saves a young creek indian and becomes his guardian spirit is 
caught in a moral dilemma when the army plans to attack the youths 
village during a sacred ceremony 
my davy crockett is certainly different from fess parkers 
dunigan said during a brief visit in los angeles the show is filmed 
in british columbia 
fess parker will always be davy crockett to a lot of people i 
dont think people are going to forget him i know i grew up 
watching him but i think people can watch me and enjoy me as davy 
crockett too actually since i was born in 1955 i think of fess 
parker more as daniel boone whom parker played in the 1960s the 
davy crockett i see was more of a will rogers of his time he was a 
storyteller who liked to sit around and tell good stories 
i think people want to see the legend still we have to give 
it more reality so there we are out in the woods we have to tell a 
story that both children and adults can enjoy its the hardest 
thing ive ever done physically 
at times the role has called for dunigan to run up a mountain 
wearing soaking wet leather clothing and carrying a heavy musket 
dunigans crockett is younger than parkers but the major 
difference is that in the past 30 years views regarding indians 
ethnic minorities and women have changed the upcoming episode 
reflects that change in the past its doubtful that crockett would 
have been sensitive to indian sacred ceremonies 
he did his share of indian fighting said dunigan but 
later when he was in congress he tried to help indians im out in 
the woods hes a hero thats the way i play him hes exciting he 
tells you straight 
dunigan first came to los angeles for a pilot called century 
city in which he played richard kileys son id been doing 
musicals and had never been in front of a camera before he said 
you know what i liked about it you could do it over again 
dunigans last show was the syndicated series captain powers 
and the soldiers of the future which was also made in canada in 
1983 he was baby sitter to an orangutan in mr smith this 
monkey business didnt last very long on wizards and warriors 
he was prince dirk blackpools incompetent brother geoffrey 
he was also the original templeton face peck in the 
ateam he appeared in the pilot but was replaced by dirk 
benedict in the longrunning series 
they said i was too young and too tall said dunigan whos 
6foot5 i look even younger on camera than i am so it was 
difficult to accept me as a veteran of the vietnam war which ended 
when i was a sophomore in high school it took me a while to get 
over it i kept saying what did i do wrong the producer stephen 
cannell said i didnt do anything wrong but i still felt it was my 
fault george peppard called to cheer me up he said he had been 
replaced in dynasty as the original blake carrington 
dunigan was filling in for a week or so as skip on the soap opera 
the young and the restless when he auditioned for davy crockett 
i replaced the actor playing skip when he went into the 
hospital he said i didnt know the character id have to 
drive out to the disney ranch for davy crockett then id drive to 
cbs television city for the soap i never knew which accent to do

the government at the moment appears to view all our efforts

recent interview 
at a series of conferences last year church leaders have called 
for dialogue with government officials on a variety of topics 
including human rights issues implementation of sovietstyle 
political reforms education policies and alternative military 
service 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness has been a frequent theme and church leaders have 
criticized the nations conservative leadership for rejecting 
outright the need for such a reform course 
church calls for change including a loosening of the nations 
tough foreign travel and emigration policies have been rebuffed by 
the government which has seized or censored several church 
publications in recent months

the east german communist party has traditionally been 
orthodox intolerant and inflexible says a western diplomatic 
source in regard to its present behavior toward the lutheran 
church its certainlyliving up to that tradition 
bishop leich said the governments reaction to the churchs 
efforts to discuss social and political problems has been needlessly 
harsh and that its refusal to discuss problems has led to a certain 
resignation among east germans 
i have the impression that in many instances the political 
leadership is no longer in touch with reality leich said 
leich ran afoul of the communist leadership when he declared 
recently that socialism in east germany should show a more human 
face in a reference to a term used to describe shortlived reforms 
in czechoslovakia in 1968 
the church has traditionally sought to work together with the 
state in resolving problems from within its willingness to 
compromise summed up in agreements with the state that defined the 
role of the church in socialism 
that view guided largely conformative church policy during the 
difficult decades of reconstruction after world war ii 
but leich said times have changed 
discussion has now become more important than simply following 
orders leich said 
we have always believed that our church has the task and 
responsibility of helping to determine and to shape our society and 
our nation to do that one must speak openly and critically 
but over the past year the church has found itself increasingly 
at odds with the government over the issue of ausreisewillige 
or those who want to leave the country 
growing dissatisfaction over economic and political conditions 
has led to a record number of applications from east germans who 
want to leave the country for neighboring capitalist west germany 
according to estimates by the west german government and human 
rights groups more than 750000 people have filed applications to 
leave east germany 
counting family members the total amounts to 15 million of the 
nations 16 million population 
in keeping with its position to change the system from within 
church leaders have been careful not to encourage east germans to 
leave the country arguing instead for patience and renewed 
commitment to the community 
we try to give people strength but its hard very hard 
said a lutheran pastor whose congregation in a small town outside 
dresden has dwindled over the years as more an more families have 
left for the west 
you cant hold a community together with people who already 
have one foot in the federal republic west germany said the 
pastor who asked that his name not be used 
at a church conference earlier this year participants urged the 
government to loosen its travel and emigration restrictions saying 
well want to stay once were allowed to leave

among all the new years resolutions that can be 
made and broken few carry a more ominous burden than the simple 
this year im going to get organized 
even in a household of modest means the paperwork pile can 
easily get out of control bills pay stubs bank statements 
canceled checks and too many others to mention 
at the start of a new year the flow reaches flood stage with 
w2s 1099s and the other trappings of income taxes 
most people dont have many alternatives to coping with this 
problem whether their filing system reposes in a single desk drawer 
or a sophisticated computer program 
you can pass along the burden of filling out your tax forms to 
some trusted friend or paid preparer but there is no way to dodge 
the legal responsibility of being able to document where you stand 
with uncle sam 
the burden of proof for the accuracy of your return is directly 
on you not your accountant tax adviser or tax preparer notes 
the accounting firm of arthur andersen amp co in its tax guide and 
planner for 1989 
tax laws passed in recent years have only served to increase the 
emphasis on recordkeeping 
these days if you inadvertently fail to report the interest 
earned on some small forgotten bank account the internal revenue 
service can quickly catch the omission 
then it can demand not only tax payment for the neglected amount 
but interest on the balance due and maybe penalties as well 
once you get your records in order of course theres the 
continuing challenge of keeping them organized what to do say 
with that file marked checking account 1979 
the irs usually has three years from the filing deadline to audit 
an individual income tax return the limit is six years if your 
income is underreported by more than 25 percent 
and there is no statute of limitations in cases where anyone has 
filed a fraudulent return or no return at all 
lets suppose you are reasonably confident you reported all your 
1979 income and didnt commit any kind of deceit in doing so the 
deadline has passed for auditing your 79 return so you can go 
ahead and throw that folder away 
but wait does it contain receipts for improvements you made to 
your house statements from a mutual fund in which you still have an 
investment documents showing nondeductible contributions to a 
retirement savings plan 
things like these could have an important bearing on the taxes 
you might owe in some future year their rightful place is in a 
permanent set of records independent of yearbyyear files 
in general arthur andersens advisers conclude when 
youre in doubt about the importance of any record keep it 
if all this makes you feel like an unpaid clerksecretary in 
thrall to the government dont despair good records can have other 
purposes and benefits 
in the course of compiling and maintaining them you can keep 
yourself and your loved ones informed about where you stand 
financially how you are progressing toward some goal or just 
where does all the money go 
records may also be vital to the orderly disposition of your 
affairs should you die or become disabled 
what would happen if someone needed to understand your affairs 
but couldnt discuss them with you arthur andersen observes 
that day will unavoidably come which is a powerful argument 
for maintaining clear accurate accessible records of your tax and 
financial life

how do you keep the kids down on 
the farm after theyve seen the big bucks and high life in west 
germany as in many other places you usually dont 
this is europes richest country and its living standard is among 
the highest in the world the family farm has a tough time holding 
its own in such an atmosphere 
when west germany was born in 1949 it had 1646751 farms but 
that has changed dramatically 
by the end of 1987 there were only 382800 farms still 
operating full time with another 280200 parttime farmers who held 
other jobs said peter neuling an agriculture ministry 
statistician 
west germany is heavily industrialized and densely populated 
with nearly 62 million people living in an area about the size of 
oregan the average farm is just under 70 acres and a parttime 
farmer generally works less than 15 acres neuling said in a 
telephone interview 
farms are closing because industry is flourishing neuling said 
and that is a sign our economy is strong but alfred kunze 64 
and other farmers say the trend is killing a tradition important to 
national selfsufficiency 
were not going to have anyone following in our footsteps 
there wont be any experienced young to take over kunze said at 
his home in auringen about 35 miles west of frankfurt 
he acknowledged farming had become risky because of 
overproduction throughout europe kunze said his 36yearold son 
hubert wanted to be a farmer but i told him to study another 
business just in case 
hubert kunze now is a computer specialist and normally works an 
eighthour day his father observed wryly farmers cant count on 
eighthour days 
as a member of the european economic community west germany must 
import farm products from other members to help balance the 
industrial goods it exports to them 
that shrinks markets and prices for west german farmers said 
alfred kunze who runs a 3500tree fruit farm in central hesse 
state 
taxes to support health retirement unemployment and other 
social benefits also make farming more difficult here than in other 
west european nations where labor and overhead are cheaper 
as costs rose west german farmers tried to close the gap with 
increased crop yields and animal feed containing hormones kunze 
said 
he said use of new fertilizers had doubled grain production since 
world war ii and cited the example of wheat which went from an 
average of about 30 bushels an acre to more than 50 
to speed up the growth of calves raised to produce 
lightcolored meat for veal which the customers demand the animals 
were fed milkbase products spiked with hormones kunze said 
now however environmentalists complain that chemical 
fertilizers pollute waterways and regulations forbid the use of 
hormones in animal feed 
in an attempt to cut production the government is paying farmers 
about 250 an acre to take land out of cultivation more than 25000 
farmers have submitted applications let roughly 425000 acres lie 
fallow in the 19881989 growing season 
this is going to turn german farmland into fruitless plains 
said klara schecke 60 whose family operates a dairy farm with 70 
head of cattle near bad orb 25 miles east of frankfurt 
hiring help is difficult even though 81 percent of west germans 
were unemployed at the end of november mrs schecke said it was 
almost impossible to find a young person willing to learn farming as 
an apprentice 
an advertisement in hessebauer the hesse state weekly farm 
magazine accomplished nothing she said 
in the latest edition there were 12 advertisments seeking 
apprentices mrs schecke told an interviewer we checked there 
hasnt been a single response the young see absolutely no future in 
farming anymore 
manfred mannel a 32yearold farmer from schenklengsfeld 70 
miles northeast of frankfurt said much the same weve advertised 
since last year to hire someone to help its hopeless 
eberhard mann spokesman for the federal labor office said 
unemployment among people under 20 was 51 percent in november but 
theyre not interested in farming because its a shrinking 
business

three graduates of cambridge university in 
england were among the signers of the american declaration of 
independence there wasnt even one from oxford university 
score that cambridge 3 oxford 0 says mark kaplanoff an 
american lecturer in history at cambridge 
ancient history scoffs henry drucker of oxford five current 
members of the us senate are oxford men score that 5to3 for 
oxford 
whatever the final score the 780yearold rivalry between 
englands two premier seats of learning has spilled across the 
atlantic indeed has gone global 
and now the contest is taking a new form fundraising 
a yank at oxford drucker is not only a booster he is also the 
universitys fundraiser appointed in 1987 he is the first person 
to hold such a post since the founding of britains oldest 
university 800 years ago 
cambridge set up a fundraising office in 1988 
the fact is that both institutions are a bit low on endowments 
and so the two queens of britains 45university chessboard are 
starting to do what 3000 american colleges and universities have 
been doing with vigor for generations hit their alumni and any 
other likely prospects for donations 
all britains universities are reacting to a squeeze for funds 
under the pennypinching government of oxford alumna margaret 
thatcher 
in 1981 oxford which traditionally honored the 24 british 
prime ministers it has produced thus far expressed its academic 
displeasure with mrs thatcher by denying her an honorary degree 
last october oxford vice chancellor sir patrick neill 
complaining that the university has more than 100 academic posts 
vacant for lack of money launched a worldwide campaign for oxford 
its goal is to raise 220 million pounds or 395 million in five 
years 
cambridge not in such dire straits is working on a cambridge 
2000 plan for the 21st century 
we are plowing a quieter furrow our needs are less 
desperate said william squire of cambridge in a telephone 
interview squire became cambridges first development director 
since 1200 ad in 1988 
both universities were encouraged for 60 years to depend on the 
british government for more than half their funds said stephen 
bragg who heads the cambridge office of the american friends of 
cambridge university a group of us alumni who unasked have 
raised 12 million for their alma mater since 1966 
under the statefunded regime both developed greatly the range 
of their teaching and research cambridge lists the discovery of 
dna the development of radioastronomy and pioneering work in 
superconductivity as examples of speculative research which paid 
off bragg said 
but he who pays the piper calls the tune he added and 
british universities are learning that in allowing government 
subsidy for teaching and research to rise to more than 50 percent of 
their total income much of their freedom has been lost 
so the race is on to raise private donations around the world and 
achieve the sort of independence that comes for example from 
harvard universitys 4billion endowment by comparison oxfords 
endowment is equivalent to 144 million 
british universities fundraising techniques look a little rusty 
from disuse one of druckers first discoveries on taking office at 
oxford was that the university did not even have an alumni roster 
jeanne sigler of jeanne sigler associates a new yorkbased firm 
specializing in nonprofit fundraising noted the alumni list is 
the lifeblood of the american university english attitudes have 
traditionally differed 
cambridge did have a list of worldwide graduates including its 
60 nobel prizewinners oxfords nobelist score by the way is 24 
but no addresses 
so how many cambridge grads are out there 
about 100000 to 120000 said squire depending on the 
mortality tables you use we will be trying to reach them all 
with a oneyear headstart drucker the son of a department store 
owner in rutherford nj is already reaching oxford alumni with 
the efficiency of a yankee trader 
we now have a mailing list of 120000 graduates around the 
globe he said thats more listings than the city of oxfords 
phone book we expect to have 140000 by 1989 including 8000 in 
the united states 
cambridge has about 5000 american graduates who set up the 
american friends group 
we now have similar organizations in japan singapore and other 
places said squire we have students from 91 countries 
drucker has two people working for him in the united states 
squire doesnt have any yet that compares with columbia 
universitys fundraising staff of 150 and princetons 200 
both oxford and cambridge have already successfully tapped 
international corporations for major funding at oxford squibb 
corp of the united states has contributed 36 million to set up a 
pharmacological research laboratory while monsanto corp and gd 
searle and co are giving 108 million for a biological institute 
cambridge has raised funds from japan and the united states to 
back new professorships usbased smithkline beckman corp has 
donated 18 million for research on aids at cambridges school of 
clinical medicine 
for 700 years we successfully raised funds in england said 
squire and after two generations of government subsidies we are 
now going back to our roots 
but its not only money he said during a visit to new york 
that he insisted was not a fundraising trip you have those three 
cambridge men who signed the american declaration of independence 
at this time exhibits from cambridges fitzwilliam museum are 
beginning a yearlong tour of american cities its a matter of 
shared heritage and values over the centuries 
besides he added as you know john harvard was a 
cambridge man chalk up the founder of harvard university as one 
more point for cambridge 
ancient history again said drucker adding that oxford is the 
alma mater of the scholars who currently head new york university 
georgetown university the university of pittsburgh mount holyoke 
pomona and johns hopkins 
chalk up a few more points for oxford

elsie may ashford hadnt seen her brother in 81 
years not since she was sent as a toddler to live with her uncle 
a few weeks ago the salvation army reunited them 
tracing missing persons is just one of an array of social 
services the churchinuniform has taken on in a history of good 
works that began with a soup kitchen in londons squalid east end in 
1866 
the organization and its socialevangelical work has since spread 
to countries around the world 
although its image is still defined by its military uniforms 
brass bands and bell jingling at collection pots the 
25millionmember army tries to adapt to the times 
recent innovations include budgeting advice for credit card 
junkies and free electronic telephone cards for downandouts and 
runaways to phone home 
the missing persons bureau handles 5000 cases a year and claims 
a 70percent success rate 
after 83yearold mrs ashfords son wrote in for help it took 
maj colin fairclough and his 24 assistants just two weeks to trace 
william pring 85 who was living about 150 miles away 
but the missing persons bureau wont handle cases where one of 
the parties seeks a divorce 
although the army regards itself first and foremost as a church 
its reputation rests heavily on its social work 
through our social work we are seen as being prepared to go 
where other people are perhaps not quite prepared to go says 
commissioner harry read who directs evangelical work in britain 
were the worlds largest volunteer organization said 
spokesman capt charles king but at the same time if our social 
work was enormously professional but no one was hearing about 
christianity we would be failing in our first task 
william booth the builders son and bornagain christian who 
founded the organization in 1865 envisaged an army of soldiers with 
military ranks to wage war on satan with bibles and compassion 
booth the first general never meant to found a church or a 
social service he simply wanted the poor to go to church 
he saw himself as a poor mans billy graham but most 
churches wouldnt have the smelly new converts and whether he 
liked it or not he had a church on this hands said read in an 
interview in his spartan office at the armys world headquarters 
near the thames river 
finding hungry people unreceptive to preaching booth opened a 
soup kitchen the first hostel opened in 1888 
bodyguards were hired to ward off mocking crowds who would pelt 
army preachers with eggs fish and rocks the first group of guards 
happened to play musical instruments so it became the first brass 
band 
the name salvation army was adopted in 1878 and from the 
outset it stressed family with booth setting the example his son 
bramwell succeeded him as general when he died in 1912 and son 
ballington and daughters emma and evangeline opened chapters in the 
united states 
the present general is eva burrows an australian and the first 
woman since evangeline booth to head the army 
today 60 percent of the soldiers have relatives in the army 
the organization has a 50millionpound 92 million budget and 
works in 89 countries running hostels for 30000 homeless schools 
for 280000 children and hospitals and homes for lepers the blind 
handicapped suicidal and sick 
among british charities it spends the least on administration 
and fundraising according to the nonprofit charities aid 
commission 
but changing mores and the growth of professional social services 
have tended to eclipse some aspects of salvation army work 
its 25000 officers havent increased in number since 1972 it no 
longer caters to unwed mothers because they now more often choose 
abortion or motherhood and roughly onefifth of its 950 beds in 
london remain empty each night 
some criticize their hostels as institutional and object to 
the 690pound 1260 fee for a bed and breakfast although the 
government reimburses the sum and the truly needy arent charged 
people find it quite authoritarian said lorna reith a 
worker with a small london homeless charity i think its a way of 
forcing their religion on people 
the army strongly denies any element of coercion but sees a 
basic duty to spread the gospel 
we are not first and foremost a social service organization 
with a church tagged on said maj colin hunt who heads one of 
the armys 14000 corps churches 
the army upholds mainstream christian beliefs but eschews such 
rituals as baptism and holy communion ministers are called officers 
and services are called meetings 
i would like more and more people to know were an evangelical 
christian church said hunt because the more people who know 
the more people will come

from their clifftop campus in hoboken nj the 
593 foreign students at stevens institute of technology have a 
grandstand view of the new york city skyline and the battery of 
skyscrapers around wall street 
to some its like a vision of the promised land and many are 
tempted to stay in this country to start careers 
currently 356200 students from other countries attend more than 
2000 colleges and universities across america and as many as 
onefifth of them do in fact stay on 
our best estimate is that in recent years only 80 to 85 percent 
of foreign students in the united states returned home says jack 
reichard vice president of the washingtonbased national 
association for foreign student affairs 
moreover 5060 percent of foreign students studying science and 
engineering a vital area for their countries as well as the united 
states decide to stay according to a study by the national 
science foundation 
about 40 percent of nonamerican phd recipients in science and 
engineering seek jobs in this country and about 40 percent of 
american university science and engineering faculty members under 
the age of 35 are now foreign nationals according to the national 
academy of sciences 
whether these young intellectuals of the world should stay on to 
make their careers in america or return home is a question in 
growing contention their individual decisions to stay or to go home 
could have a considerable impact on world affairs 
leon febres cordero who earned a bachelor of engineering degree 
at stevens in 1953 completed a fouryear term as president of 
ecuador last august 
niklos nemeth an economist with postgraduate training at harvard 
university was named in november to be prime minister of hungary 
benazir bhutto who has a ba from radcliffe college became prime 
minister of pakistan elected in december as the first woman ever to 
head a moslem government 
in dozens of other nations of every political persuasion 
graduates of american universities have occupied positions of 
influence and power in politics industry and other fields 
foreign students who decided to stay on in the united states have 
been no less successful 
shanghaiborn an wang who was sent to study physics at harvard 
by president chiang kaishek of nationalist china stayed on in the 
united states to found wang laboratories a major scientific 
company and make a fortune estimated by forbes magazine at 365 
million 
the average foreign university student attends courses for about 
35 years reichard said in a telephone interview so it may be 
estimated with about 350000 foreign students in the country that 
approximately 100000 new universitylevel students enter the 
country each year 
according to us immigration figures about 20000 of these 
foreign youths among the worlds best and brightest trade in their 
student visas for immigration cards 
the foreign students come from 186 countries and territories two 
thirds of them are from developing nations where in many cases a 
depressing paradox awaits them on their return home there is a 
desperate need for their knowledge but jobs are scarce and poorly 
paid even at the advanced level they have achieved 
so the temptation to remain in the united states is strong 
making it even stronger is the encouragement of some american 
business and academic leaders acutely aware of a shortage of 
americanborn science students in particular 
according to the council on competitiveness the united states 
could face a shortfall of 500000 americanborn scientists and 
engineers by the year 2010 due to retirements and the declining 
number of american students choosing careers in these fields 
the council composed of 151 chief executives of industry labor 
and higher education also noted in a report last july that 1300 to 
1800 engineering positions are vacant even now at american 
universities 
how can we replenish these faculty positions asks stevens 
president harold j raveche it takes 10000 high school students 
expressing an interest in a science or engineering major to assure 
us of 20 doctorates 
we should talk about our education deficit rather than about 
our budget deficit says kenneth wilson 1982 winner of the nobel 
physics prize we need math and science teachers he said during 
a forum on us competitiveness at stevens 
the academic gap is being filled by an increasing number of 
professors from other countries particularly india japan and other 
asian nations 
sixty percent of all foreign students in the united states are in 
engineering mathematics computer sciences physical and life 
sciences or managementrelated fields according to the new 
yorkbased institute of international education which administers 
international scholarship programs and places thousands of foreign 
students in us schools 
an important policy need is to encourage developingcountry 
nationals to return home their us education should represent a 
brain gain not a drain says institute chairman charles h percy 
a former illinois senator 
dissenting peter sprague chairman of the board of national 
semiconductor corp notes that the american university system is 
unmatched in the world and the united states is a mecca for foreign 
students 
about half our science and engineering graduate students are 
foreigners we should give them green cards admitting them as 
immigrants said sprague at the stevens forum he said he spoke for 
the high technology industries of californias silicon valley 
while us universities may set a high standard american primary 
and secondary education is often inadequate said pulitzer 
prizewinning author david halberstam at the stevens forum 
technical universities like stevens are at the cutting edge of 
economic development he said but the japanese are killing us 
in ninth grade mathematics

a lone assassin rapidly fired 
five shots at pointblank range through the window of a small 
pizzeria then vanished into the cold december night on a motorcycle 
he left behind three people dead or dying three wounded and his 
belgianmade 12gauge sawedoff shotgun a trademark of an 
underworld killing 
the next morning at a gas station across town a moblinked 
contractor opened the door of his bulletproof car and died along 
with his soninlaw in bursts of submachinegun and automatic rifle 
fire 
the ndrangheta the name for the calabrian underworld has made 
a killing field of the faded cities and towns in the rugged hills 
and along the jagged coast of italys impoverished southern tip 
in the past year 165 people have been murdered in the province 
of reggio calabria at least 50 of them in this city across the 
strait of messina from sicily the death toll is staggering when 
compared to just 31 killings in the province of rome which has a 
population of about 37 million more than six times greater than 
reggio calabrias 589000 
investigators say most of the calabrian dead fell victim to the 
struggle for control of the drug trade or to a 25yearold blood 
feud between two powerful crime families 
in certain zones of sicily calabria and campagna naples the 
possession of the territory by organized crime is total domenico 
sica italys high antimafia commissioner recently told 
parliaments antimafia commission 
the bosses of the ndrangheta which means society of valorous 
men rule their calabrian territories through fear and 
intimidation their retribution is swift and lethal often life in 
their domain is short and incredibly cheap 
one romebased investigator speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the average price for a hired killing in calabria is 400 
freelance hit men sometimes kill for free hoping to curry favor 
with a certain boss 
drugs are at the core of the criminal empire that links the 
ndrangheta with the sicilian mafia colombian cocaine kingpins and 
heroin warlords of asia 
experts estimate italian crime bosses earn 10 billion to 12 
billion a year from the international heroin trade and that sales of 
cocaine and other drugs may push the total above 20 billion 
the ndrangheta also profits from murdersforhire gunrunning 
trading in counterfeit dollars and kidnapping rings that collect 
huge ransoms for quick reinvestment in drug deals 
calabrian businesses must pay extortion to avoid the torch and 
corrupt politicians swell ndrangheta coffers with millions 
misdirected from public works contracts government development 
funds and investment schemes designed to benefit italys blighted 
south 
to reassert control the government proposes expanding the powers 
of police investigating organized crime and drug trafficking one 
measure would give police the authority to conduct undercover 
investigations forbidden in a postwar italy that remembers abuses 
under the fascist dictatorship of benito mussolini 
in rome us drug enforcement administration agents already are 
quietly training italian authorities in undercover work 
interior minister antonio gava also has promised better training 
for police specialized departments creation of mobile groups to 
help in trouble spots and new local commissioners to oversee the war 
on crime in calabria 
this encourages lt col corrado borruso commander of the 
carabinieri paramilitary police in reggio di calabria who are on 
the front line of the war with crime 
borruso said he believes the government can defeat the 
ndrangheta that it can use expanded powers and undercover 
operations to go after the leaders and stop the killing 
it will be a struggle really a long struggle said borruso 
we must seek to stop this slaughter through the arrest of the big 
bosses who pull the strings of all the ndrangheta operations 
however some other investigators question the political will of 
the government to do the things necessary to defeat organized crime 
billions of dollars in illicit profits bolster the clout of the 
mafia and ndrangheta and some politicians owe their careers to 
votes collected by the mob 
privately some investigators admit they cant penetrate the 
tightknit clans of the ndrangheta and dont know enough about its 
operation 
for example they know the calabrians help smuggle tons of 
morphine base into italy from southwest asia to refine it and to 
sell it in europe and in the united states through contacts in 
toronto 
but they dont know the details of the partnership with the 
sicilians who really control the drug market or how much the 
calabrians share in the profits 
informers and hirelings willing to testify against their 
calabrian bosses are extremely rare 
he who is blind deaf and dumb will live a hundred years 
advises an italian proverb on the code of silence called the 
omerta or diffidenza 
the ndrangheta has a long memory and a long reach while italy 
laments the romebased investigator has no effective witness 
protection program 
the governments enemy is also formidable in its sheer size 
police say there are 156 ndrangheta clans in calabria 93 of them 
in the province of reggio calabria police records list slightly 
over 4000 members of the clans in calabria but investigators have 
said they believe that for everyone on the list there are at least 
two who have escaped identification 
police from all agencies in calabria number about 3600 
but borruso and other investigators bristle at suggestions that 
they need more manpower apparently considering such recommendations 
a veiled slap at police effectiveness 
it is not only a question or a problem for the police said 
borruso 
the government he said must change the things in calabria that 
permit the ndrangheta to flourish 
his sentiments are echoed by politicians both nationally and 
locally who believe italy can never defeat the ndrangheta in 
calabria the camorra in campagna or the mafia in sicily as long as 
the regions are allowed to languish in poverty 
calabria ranks at the bottom of the list of per capita income by 
region with its citizens earning 44 percent less than the national 
average calabrias unemployment rate of 216 percent is nearly 
twice the 119 percent for italy as a whole and two and a half times 
the rate for the countrys affluent north 
calabria like much of the rest of southern italy has not 
benefited significantly from the industrial boom and the economic 
resurrgence that italy contends has given it the wests 
fifthlargest economy many of calabrias factories sit idle its 
ports are largely empty much of its land is rocky mountainous and 
untilled 
in the absence of an adequate presence by the state the 
ndrangheta has penetrated into the vital nerve centers of the 
economy politics and public administration calabrias regional 
president rosario olivio said at a recent meeting with sica gava 
and antimafia investigators 
the central problem is unemployment and around that turns 
everything else said olivio

widely ignored and usually docile 
south africas black homelands are producing a new generation of 
leaders frustrated with limited autonomy and demanding a bigger role 
in shaping the political future 
the authoritarian tribal chiefs who have long ruled the 10 
homelands are being replaced or challenged by younger men who view 
their territories as key partners in a united south africa rather 
than isolated tribal reservations 
the youth see the homelands differently than their parents and 
it is not attractive to them said gen bantu holomisa the 
33yearold military ruler of transkei transkei in 1976 was the 
first homeland to become independent from south africa 
we have been given a raw deal by south africa and we wont 
settle for that again holomisa said in a recent interview in 
umtata transkeis capital 
no foreign governments recognize the homelands including the 
four that south africa classifies as independent transkei 
bophuthatswana venda and ciskei 
antiapartheid activists dismiss the homelands as the 
illegitimate offspring of apartheid which denies south africas 
black majority a voice in national affairs 
the homelands have little industry scarce arable land and are 
heavily dependent on south african financial aid they are largely 
ignored both in south africa and abroad although they have more 
than 13 million residents about half south africas black 
population 
holomisa and other likeminded homeland leaders concede they lack 
leverage when they ask the south african government for a role in 
negotiating political change 
but their goal of a unified south africa directly challenges the 
foundation of the ethnicbased homeland system designed by hendrik 
verwoerd south africas prime minister from 1958 to 1966 
verwoerd sought to make all black south africans citizens of the 
remote homelands granting them local autonomy while whites 
controlled the national economy and government 
a conservative older generation of tribal chiefs accepted 
selfgovernment in the 1960s and 1970s receiving financial benefits 
and the support of south african security forces in return the 
chiefs have neither instigated nor tolerated antiapartheid activism 
however younger leaders see the territories only as an interim 
step on the road to a black government in south africa 
in our own territory we have tried to promote our own 
agenda and unequivocally to destroy the apartheid structure 
enos mabuza the 49yearold leader of the kangwane homeland 
recently told the magazine leadership 
our objective is that kangwane should be part of south 
africa if not now then in the long term he said 
mabuza has risked the wrath of the south african government by 
maintaining contacts with leaders of the outlawed african national 
congress guerrilla movement the largest organization fighting the 
government he describes the anc as a key actor perhaps the most 
important actor among black political organizations 
he also has refused independence for tiny kangwane near 
south africas eastern border with mozambique 
the south african government would like all 10 homelands to 
become independent as part of its policy of racial separation 
critics say the government wants to fragment the black population 
and decrease its political clout 
only four homelands have opted for independence and none has 
chosen that route since ciskei in 1981 
several developments in the past year suggest growing 
antiapartheid activism in the homelands and a general discontent 
with the system 
in kwandebele voters in december overwhelmingly ousted all 16 
parliament members up for election including chief minister george 
mahlangu the defeated incumbents supported independence plans for 
the small patch of arid territory outside pretoria that is home to 
about 300000 people 
in bophuthatswana dissident army officers launched a coup 
attempt feb 10 against president lucas mangope who has led the 
homeland since it was declared independent in 1977 
the group that kidnapped mangope was led by an antiindependence 
politician peter metsing who remains at large south african 
troops rescued mangope and restored him to power hours after he was 
captured 
in venda a nominally independent homeland in the far north 
students and workers staged a highly effective general strike in 
august to protest an alleged government coverup of ritual murders 
in kwazulu homeland leader mangosuthu buthelezis inkatha 
political organization is locked in a power struggle with the now 
banned united democratic front a nationwide coalition of 
antiapartheid groups more than 1000 have died in blackonblack 
faction fighting around the cities of pietermaritzburg and durban in 
the past two years 
buthelezi the best known homeland leader is a critic of 
apartheid and was an anc member years ago but many activists view 
him as too conservative due to his current condemnation of the anc 
and his refusal to support confrontational tactics such as economic 
sanctions consumer boycotts and strikes 
in transkei holomisa says he does not pursue contact with the 
anc because it would invite economic punishment from the south 
african government 
nonetheless he says there will never be genuine change without 
the anc and other major antiapartheid groups 
holomisa stresses that many of transkeis most pressing problems 
are economic not political 
located on the indian ocean coast transkei is a visually 
spectacular collection of rolling hills winding rivers and 
waterfalls 
but 95 percent of the people live in impoverished rural 
settlements and 80 percent are illiterate infant mortality is 
high and life expectancy is low most men who have jobs work 
outside the homeland and either have long daily commutes or are far 
from their families most of the year 
because transkei is not recognized internationally it receives 
no economic aid except from south africa 
south africas racial policies have hurt us said holomisa 
but international sanctions also make us suffer there are human 
problems here that cant be wished away by pretending we dont 
exist

as ronald reagan steps from the stage he 
leaves a world remarkably different from the one he inherited eight 
years ago during reagans watch sovietamerican relations took on 
a warmth that could not have been anticipated then much of latin 
america shed its dictators and embraced democracy the united 
nations gained in importance the us government opened talks with 
the palestine liberation organization which the reagan

washington reagan rewrote the book on dealing with the kremlin 
but if the book has changed so has moscow and so has reagan 
at the outset reagan labelled the soviet union an evil 
empire whose leaders asserted for themselves the right to commit 
any crime to lie to cheat to attain their goal 
so far detente has been a oneway street that the soviet union 
has used to pursue its own aims reagan said on jan 29 1981 
he backed his rhetoric with a trillion dollar defense buildup 
the soviets cranked up their propaganda machine in response 
equating the reagan administration with hitlers third reich 
after the soviets walked out of talks to limit intermediaterange 
missiles reagan pulled his biggest surprise in march 1983 
directing us scientists to devise a shield against 
intercontinental ballistic missiles 
the strategic defense initiative reversed an 11yearold policy 
and has dominated the arms control debate since then it is widely 
credited with driving the soviets back to the bargaining table 
at the same time one generation was giving way to another in the 
kremlin leonid brezhnev who was soviet leader when reagan took 
office and under whom the soviets invaded afghanistan in december 
1979 and countenanced the military crackdown against polands 
solidarity labor union two years later died in november 1982 
he was followed in quick succession by two elderly men yuri 
andropov and konstantin chernenko who died in office and gave way 
to mikhail s gorbachev in march 1985 reagan and gorbachev found 
they could do business 
in december 1987 they signed a treaty that for the first time 
eliminated a whole class of new nuclear weapons and created a highly 
intrusive system of onsite verification 
the two sides also have made progress on a treaty to sharply 
reduce longrange weapons although differences remain especially 
over star wars 
the changes have been profound enough for reagan to declare at a 
news conference concluding the moscow summit last summer that he had 
great confidence in gorbachevs ability to change the soviet 
union

washington israel considered reagan its best friend in the 
white house since president harry s truman supported establishment 
of the jewish state 40 years ago but in his last weeks reagan and 
secretary of state george p shultz authorized talks with the plo 
it was a shocking turn of events bound to open a new chapter in the 
mideasts history 
the decision based on statements made by plo chairman yasser 
arafat renouncing terrorism and saying a palestinian state would 
live alongside israel dismayed prime minister yitzhak shamir and 
was denounced by the jerusalem government still the criticism was 
muted while american jewish leaders also held their fire this was 
largely due to the trust reagan and shultz had built up 
peace plans advanced unsuccessfully by reagan and shultz did 
not provide for an independent palestinian state nor call on israel 
to relinquish all of the west bank and gaza 
us criticism of the spread of jewish outposts in the 
territories was muted and a un resolution condemning them as 
illegal and an obstruction to peace was vetoed by the united states 
the strenuous american campaign against terrorism led by shultz 
cemented ties with israel a target of extremists american jets 
bombed tripoli the capital of libya and shultz denied a visa to 
arafat to speak at the united nations in new york 
ironically only a few weeks later shultz approved a 
substantive dialogue with the plo which enhanced arafats 
prestige and was received with jubilation in the arab world 
in another curious twist the untied states and israel secretly 
provided arms to iran despite irans presence on the state 
departments list of countries that support terrorism the purpose 
was to encourage moderation in tehran and to secure the release of 
american hostages nine remain in captivity as reagan leaves office 
in 1982 when israeli troops and tanks rolled into lebanon in a 
campaign to wipe out the plo the reagan administration organized a 
diplomatic effort to stop the invasion short of beirut and 
dispatched us marines to protect the plo as it evacuated the 
country 
lebanese christians massacred palestinians that september in 
refugee camps south of beirut bringing us marines back to lower 
tensions this mission ended in disaster terrorists blew up the 
us embassy in april 1983 and bombed the marines headquarters in 
october killing 241 servicemen 
in 1983 shultz worked out an agreement for israel to withdraw 
its troops while lebanon moved toward recognition of the jewish 
state syria and saudi arabia persuaded lebanon to abandon the 
accord 
in the meantime reagans plan for peace talks between israel and 
the arabs did not get off the ground when it was rejected by 
menachem begin then israels prime minister in 1982 
shultz tried a similar version of landforpeace in 1988 but 
it was not accepted by israel jordan and palestinians 
a tougher test of the usiraelirelationship began with rising 
violence by palestinian arabs on the west bank and in gaza a year 
ago and the establishment of a us dialogue with the plo a matter 
now put in george bushs hands

years but in october addressing the 159 nations of the general

washington reagan took office determined to reverse prosoviet 
sentiment in central america he leaves with those hopes unfulfilled 
nicaraguas leftist government appears firmly entrenched as the 
thousands of contra rebels on whom reagan invested much political 
capital find themselves in dreary camps along the 
hondurannicaraguan border cut off from us military support 
reagan once told a press conference that his goal in nicaragua was 
to see the sandinistas say uncle 
in el salvador there is more uncertainty than at any time since 
1984 when a democraticallyelected president jose napoleon duarte 
took office 
that event was a victory for administration perseverance but 
duartes term is ending with a guerrilla war still raging and living 
standards far below what they were a decade ago despite hundreds of 
millions of dollars of us aid the countrys political life is 
marked by increasing polarization 
military governments in guatemala and honduras have given way to 
elected governments but in both countries full blown democracy has 
yet to take root 
nicaragua ranks as a major reagan disappointment in every other 
regional conflict afghanistan angola and cambodia the 
administration can claim a measure of success 
reagan was never able to sell the notion to the american people 
that the sandinista government was a menace which left unchecked 
would result in the spread of marxism throughout central america and 
into mexico 
he could never rally a sustainable consensus in support of his 
view that the best way to deal with the sandinistas was through 
generous support for the contra rebels who reagan once called the 
moral equivalent of the founding fathers 
within the reagan white house the contra cause became a highly 
emotional issue it induced some of the administrations most 
strategically placed people national security advisor john 
poindexter and lt col oliver north to bend or perhaps break the 
law because defeat of the contras seemed so unthinkable both were 
charged with breaking the law

washington reagan leaves office with a mixed record on arms 
control the treaty he signed at the washington summit with 
gorbachev in december 1987 was a landmark for the first time in 
history an entire category of us and soviet missiles those in 
the intermediate range of 300 to 3000 miles was abolished 
the treaty also broke new ground in providing for soviet 
inspectors to observe the destruction of banned us missiles here 
while american monitors checked up on the soviets at their sites 
left undone however was the larger reagan goal of completing a 
treaty to reduce globegirdling nuclear missiles bombers and 
submarines by 30 to 50 percent 
some of the weapons ticketed for cutbacks such as sealaunched 
cruise missiles are extremely difficult to detect negotiations 
stalled over verification procedures while the soviets never 
abandoned their attempt to impose some sort of restrictions on the 
us antiballistic missile program as part of a strategic arms 
reduction treaty 
the program known formally as the strategic defense initiative 
is aimed at mounting a defense in space against soviet ballistic 
missiles 
in other arms control areas reagan did not reach an agreement 
with the soviets on ways to monitor underground nuclear tests nor 
find a way to deter the proliferation of chemical weapons he 
accused the soviets in reports to congress of probably exceeding the 
permissible 150kiloton ceiling on underground blasts

washington the prime minister of japan made his getacquainted 
call less than four months into president reagans first term 
questioned about defense policy by members of the house foreign 
affairs committee prime minister zenko suzuki said japan felt it 
better to be a porcupine than a roaring lion 
but the official interpreter got it wrong and porcupine came 
out in english as wise mouse the japanese embassy corrected the 
animal mixup but the incident still triggered a burst of comment 
that japan was shirking responsibility and enjoying a free ride 
on defense at the cost of the united states 
to some americans those displaced from jobs by imports japan 
may look today like a lionsized economic porcupine but experts 
rate overall relations better today than at the beginning of the 
reagan years 
quality and priceconscious us consumers continue to buy up 
japanese products lack of american competitiveness has become 
recognized as part of the problem of us trade deficits that rose 
from 16 billion with japan in 1981 to nearly 70 billion before 
they started to decline last year 
eight years and two prime ministers after suzuki visited 
washington the japanese continue to shun a roaring lion 
military role and there is greater acceptance of this at the 
pentagon and white house the reagan administration hails as a 
success the defense relationship in which japan now helps pay the 
upkeep of nearly 55000 us personnel on its territory and provides 
destroyers antisubmarine patrols and jet fighters to defend 
sealanes up to 1000 nautical miles off its shores 
it also applauds japans offsetting of its 
constitutionallymandated low military profile by becoming the 
worlds largest foreign aid donor with a fiveyear 50 billion 
program of assistance tied less and less to buying japanese products 
experts give reagan and his administration good marks for 
recognizing japans growing status as an economic superpower vital 
to the united states and encouraging the relationship to mature into 
a partnership stressing dialogue and shared benefits more than 
namecalling

for reagan mrs thatcher has stood alone among the other west 
european leaders even at political cost for example she was the 
sole ally to back the 1986 us bombing raid on libya which most 
others in britain denounced as heavyhanded and futile 
under mrs thatcher britain followed the united states out of 
unesco in 1985 was the first to deploy us cruise missiles in 
europe in 1983 and when the superpowers agreed in 1987 to remove 
the missiles she publicly endorsed the deal despite private

mrs thatcher was given to bluntly reminding her fellow europeans 
in nato or the european economic community of their reliance on us 
military and diplomatic power this has revived complaints that the 
british cling to old transatlantic ties and are unenthusiastic 
europeans 
reagans style provoked amusement concern or jibing among 
british opposition parties and in newspapers but not even in strict 
confidence would thatcher aides utter a word of criticism of the 
president 
reagan and thatcher have disagreed on economic issues like the 
us deficit and she had misgivings about the missiles deal but 
theyre obviously fond of each other call each other ron and 
margaret and share some basic instincts like their faith in the 
free market and a strong defense and their hatred of socialism 
you have restored faith in the american dream mrs thatcher

his two terms were very good friends and it is a friendship i

washington the reagan administration looked as if it was going 
to come up empty on its southern africa policies until chester 
crocker the assistant secretary of state pulled out an 11th hour 
peace agreement on angola 
until crocker a former georgetown university professor helped 
negotiate the peace agreement last month he was best known as the 
architect of the administrations policy of constructive 
engagement it called for the united states to use diplomatic 
pressure to force the whiteruled government of south africa to 
change its policies of racial segregation called apartheid 
constructive engagement no longer part of the state 
departments official lexicon was not a success south africas 
policies remain virtually the same with blacks denied political and 
social rights 
in the united states constructive engagement was the target 
of criticism and ridicule and opponents of south africa mounted a 
campaign which resulted in legislation in 1986 providing for 
economic sanctions against the white regime they provided for a ban 
on new investments a prohibition on the import of certain south 
african products and the suspension of south african commercial 
landing rights in the united states reagans veto of the sanctions 
was overridden decisively 
in angola where the reagan administration and south africa had 
supported rebels seeking to overthrow the cubanbacked marxist 
government crocker was more successful 
after months of mediating delicate negotiations south africa 
cuba and angola signed an agreement under which angola pledged to 
send home 50000 cuban troops posted in angola 
at the same time south africa granted independence to southwest 
africa the continents last colony it will become the blackruled 
nation of namibia

washington with us encouragement much of latin america has 
undergone an unprecedented political transformation from 
dictatorship to democracy over the past decade but the region is 
nonetheless worse off economically now than when the generals were 
in charge 
reagan and shultz have repeatedly hailed the democratic 
development in the hemisphere nonetheless the same economic forces 
that swept the dictatorships from power during the 1980s are now 
threatening the emerging democracies in some countries the 
possibility of a military coup is not ruled out 
as reagan leaves office the potential political and economic 
consequences of continued stagnation partly the result of the

the plan calls for economic reforms in the debtor countries and 
new public and private lending from the developed countries to meet 
their capital needs but lending has been far below what had been 
expected when the plan was unveiled three years ago 
hemispheric countries over the past five years have shelled out 
more than 120 billion in debt repayments than they have received in 
new loans repayments on the regions 420 billion debt have meant 
that decades of hardwon gains for some countries have been wiped 
out 
the region has been denied capital needed for investment and 
imports vital for production have been cut back sharply inflation 
and high unemployment are rampant 
the list of countries which have made the shift to democracy or 
are in the process of doing so since 1979 is impressive argentina 
brazil bolivia chile ecuador peru uruguay el salvador 
honduras and guatemala 
but in virtually all of these countries the popular base of the 
incumbent administrations has been eroding reflecting the 
difficulty they have in dealing with the consequences of excessive 
borrowing in the past 
increasingly latin leaders see debt relief as perhaps the only 
way their countries can restore economic growth and to prevent yet 
another lost decade

washington reagans departure coincides with the start of a 
sixyear term by a new mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
offer both countries a fresh opportunity for a more harmonious 
relationship 
reagan met frequently with former mexican president miguel de la 
madrid and the two got along well but the same cannot be said for 
officials at the lower level 
the two governments disagreed sharply over central america 
particularly nicaragua where mexico was viewed by administration 
officials as perhaps the most stalwart noncommunist backer of the 
leftist sandinista government 
elliott abrams the outgoing assistant secretary of state for 
latin america concedes that the ideological tone of mexicos 
foreign policy over the years left the administration very 
unhappy 
us officials angered mexico by suggesting that official 
corruption was hampering that countrys drug enforcement efforts 
mexico felt the reagan administration failed to appreciate the 
sacrifices its security forces made to come to grips with the drug 
issue 
drugs remain a potent issue mexico is believed to provide 30 
percent of the marijuana and 40 percent of the heroin reaching this 
country 
immigration is another divisive issue the reagan administration 
maintained that unwise mexican economic policies forced millions of 
mexicans to cross the border illegally mexicos view is that the 
immigration is the result of the us demand for cheap labor which 
it claims american policies fail to take into account 
on the economic front mexico has maintained that paying the 
interest on its 107 billion foreign debt makes growth impossible 
when bush takes office mexico will be eagerly awaiting some sign 
that he will be amenable to a policy under which mexicos debt 
servicing obligations might be matched to its payment capacity 
mexico has felt for years that its debt is the primary cause for a 
steady decline in mexican living standards during the 1980s

with the same visions of stardom that carried 
scores of farm girls to this town in years past foreign investors 
today are migrating to hollywood to make it big in the entertainment 
industry 
japans sony corp has been trying to purchase film studio mgm 
for months without success british broadcaster television south plc 
acquired television producer mtm enterprises for 310 million in 
july australian businessman alan saffron bought film producer 
atlantic entertainment group on dec 13 
and numerous other overseas buyers flush with cash and bolstered 
by strong currencies have their checkbooks unholstered waiting for 
the right moment to join southern californias movers and shakers 
i predict that over the next three to five years youre going 
to have two or three major studios change hands said steve 
rosenberg president of entertainment consulting firm rose media 
i truly believe that the japanese will at least own one of them 
and maybe the germans will own another 
you get the glamor and glitter to some extent but there are 
also investment characteristics said nancy schwalb whose star 
partners arranges limited participation in films such as a fish 
called wanda 
investors from australia japan france and canada schwalb said 
are interested in the industry because its so strong and they 
appreciate the growth 
even though the film industry is enjoying record profits several 
large and small film studios are desperately in need of money 
there are a lot of companies in serious trouble or potentially 
serious trouble said charles meeker head of the entertainment 
division at law firm white amp case 
cocacolas columbia pictures for one has floundered recently 
and is rumored to be for sale mgm sits dead in the water atlantic 
entertainment just purchased by saffrons kvc video for an 
undisclosed sum was left destitute by boxoffice busts like patty 
hearst and 1969 
yet the continuing deregulation of european television and the 
boom in overseas vcr sales 60 percent of japanese homes have vcrs 
have created a nearly insatiable demand for us programming 
american television shows and movies even domestic bombs like 
airwolf and rambo iii have a remarkable ability to draw 
audiences in most foreign countries 
theres a major change in the regulatory environment in europe 
and theres an excess of japanese capital looking for a home said 
harold vogel an entertainment industry analyst at merrill lynch 
capital markets the combination of those two things means that 
foreign money will move toward the domestic film business 
entertainmentindustry investments give electronic manufacturers 
an unbeatable opportunity to create fullservice companies sonys 
recent 2 billion purchase of cbs records for instance yielded a 
firm with both hardware record tape and cd players and software 
the epic columbia and portrait record labels 
were looking at hollywood because of our interest in video 
precisely the same reason we looked at cbs records because of our 
interest in audio said michael schuloff sonys vice chairman 
following sonys model japan entertainment conglomerate tokuma 
group has opened a los angeles office scouring the city for related 
investment opportunities 
mainly we are now looking for video rights for movies to 
show in japan said hiro iijima general manager of tokumas north 
american operations in the future we would like to get 
theatrical motion picture television and home video rights 
the easiest way to do that of course is to buy a studio already 
owning such rights 
the foreign equation can work both ways a few leading 
programmers disney nbc have begun spreading their franchises 
overseas so far though the advances have been tentative but i 
think youre going to see the successful us studios make major 
moves into foreign markets meeker said 
yet blindly snapping up an entertainment company is as perilous 
as attending a jerry lewis film festival 
sony pictures a tiny movie company now disguised as svs films 
has yet to become a successful producer sony removed its name from 
the enterprise when its releases including a lowbudget slasher 
film called party line threatened to tarnish sonys golden 
corporate image 
svs latest theatrical release an exploitation film called 
vicious will not establish sony as a highbrow producer the 
movie playing in just a handful of theaters is described by the 
entertainment newspaper variety as ludicrous a violent 
cheapie featuring a vulgar screenplay 
entertainment is clearly more risky than other loan 
investments but thats not to say that its necessarily 
outrageous said william newby assistant vice president in the 
entertainment industry department at national westminster bank usa 
you cant always apply typical accounting standards to the 
entertainment industry newby said if a bank or any investor 
does their homework i think there are values to be found 
certainly 
but it seems to be an industry where an awful lot of folks 
dont know what theyre getting into

toronto canada and the united states head for a new era of 
trade cooperation as reagan leaves office 
the free trade agreement that he signed with prime minister brian 
mulroney a year ago won approval only after an intensive debate in 
canada that showed just how wary many here are of their larger and 
more powerful neighbor 
the impact of the agreement which took effect on jan 1 will be 
gradual over a 10year period 
but the debate also put the spotlight on the remarkable ties that 
have developed between canada and the united states already and 
their twoway trading partnership the largest such relationship in 
the world 
canadas prosperity and economic growth have paralleled and 
frequently exceeded the united states during the past six years as 
in the united states concern also has been voiced here that 
affluence has gone only to some parts of society and instead of 
trickling down has created a harsh uncaring class system 
reagan and mulroney shared not only a conservative outlook but an 
irish heritage that improved relations between washington and 
ottawa sometimes at odds before 1984 under prime minister pierre 
trudeau 
the biggest lingering source of friction between the two 
countries is the inability to achieve agreement on acid rain 
despite mulroneys claims to easy access with reagan the canadian 
leader has said he hopes to do better on the issue with bush 
mulroney seeks a treaty under which the us government would 
promise to order reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide 
emissions under a fixed schedule just as canada is cutting its 
emissions by 50 percent

toyota motor corp says it will go ahead with the 
introduction of a new line of luxury cars despite a judges ruling 
that the models name must be changed 
us district judge david n edelstein in new york ruled that 
toyota may not use the lexus name for the cars because it will 
damage the trademark of a similarly named computer database service 
the ruling came in a lawsuit filed against the japanese carmaker 
by mead data central inc which sells a database service to the 
legal profession under the name lexis 
edelstein found friday that the advertising barrage toyota plans 
for its lexus line will dwarf the lexis mark despite the 
difference in spelling he said that when people hear the name the 
car rather than the computer product might come to mind first 
edelstein added that toyota consistently refused to acknowledge 
that its use of lexus might harm meads lexis mark 
but the judge noting that toyota had already spent enormous sums 
on lexus gave toyota five days to accept an alternate order that 
would permit it to use the name provided it meet certain conditions 
among them are making payments to mead to enable the company to 
preserve the distinctiveness of its lexis trademark through 
increased advertising and running a disclaimer in all lexus 
advertising stating that the car line is not connected with meads 
product 
the amount of compensation to mead for extra advertising would be 
subject to negotiation between mead and toyota 
on monday toyota obtained a temporary stay of edelsteins 
injunction on thursday a panel of the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals is expected to hear arguments on whether the stay should be 
extended said mead which is based in dayton ohio 
if the stay is not extended toyota will be prohibited from using 
the lexus name when exhibiting its new car line at automobile shows 
that open saturday in detroit and los angeles mead said 
but jim olson spokesman for toyota motor sales usa inc said 
tuesday that the official launch of the car line scheduled for 
thursday in detroit would go ahead as planned because of the stay 
the us affiliate based in torrance calif also was named in 
the suit 
olson said he could not comment on whether toyota would accept 
the alternate order which was proposed by mead because the matter 
was under appeal 
we were shocked by the lower courts decision which we 
consider wrong and utterly without basis in fact or law said bob 
mccurry executive vice president of toyota motor sales 
edelsteins ruling came under a new york law that entitles a 
trademark owner to relief if it can demonstrate that its trademark 
is likely to be diluted by another companys use of the same or 
similar name 
arthur greenbaum a new york trademark attorney said the 
proposed advertising disclaimers have been used in similar cases 
but called unusual and creative the proposal that toyota pay 
mead to increase its lexis advertising 
toyota said it planned to have the japanese cars in us 
showrooms in midseptember the lexus line represents a move to the 
high end of the car market for toyota which established its 
reputation as a maker of highquality moderately priced vehicles 
toyota said the twomodel lexus line costing 20000 to 35000 
will compete with mercedesbenz and bmw a segment of the market 
being targeted by other japanese carmakers 
lexis the dataretrieval service provides information on court 
decisions as well as access to many other data bases it is used by 
law firms as well as by those in many other fields

one of the most expensive bottling transactions 
ever proposed pepsicos 15 billion plan to buy general cinema 
corps soft drink bottling business has collapsed following a 
government request for more information that delayed the deal 
the deal disintegrated friday when the federal trade commission 
asked for additional details to determine whether it might violate 
antitrust laws the companies said tuesday 
under the agreement signed by general cinema and pepsico on nov 
30 the deal was contingent on a 1988 closure for tax reasons 
had the deal succeeded it would have brought one of the nations 
biggest independent bottlers under pepsis control allowing the 
soft drink giant to consolidate bottling operations and reduce 
costs industry analysts said 
the deal would have allowed general cinema to take advantage of a 
provision in the federal tax law allowing them to defer 400 million 
in capital gains taxes over 20 years that provision expired dec 31 
general cinema and pepsico officials said tuesday that they have 
been already conferring about a new deal 
but the announcement that the original transaction collapsed 
evidently helped depress general cinemas stock which fell 150 a 
share to 24 on the new york stock exchange pepsico was unchanged 
at 3950 a share 
the question is how much is it worth to them pepsico and can 
they continue to negotiate said lawrence adelman an analyst with 
dean witter reynolds but pepsi feels it has a strategic fit 
there and general cinema has strategic problems of its own 
jim griffith a spokesman for pepsico said it was not fair to 
compare any deal made in 1988 with one that may be negotiated this 
year griffith termed the ftcs action a disappointment 
peter farwell vicepresident of general cinema said the ftcs 
move was unexpected the deal as it stood in 1988 is off he 
said 
the cost to pepsico or the compensation to general cinema will 
be decidedly different because uncle sam will have his hand in the 
till for more money said roy d burry a senior vicepresident at 
the wall street brokerage house of kidder peabody inc if a new 
deal is done the parties will have to take a lot less or pay a lot 
more 
general cinema a film exhibition and softdrink bottling concern 
based in chestnut hill mass owns and operates 1359 movie screens 
at 318 locations throughout the united states earnings from the 
movie operations declined about 5 percent despite a slight rise in 
box office revenues in the fiscal year ended oct 31 
general cinema also owns about 60 percent of the neiman marcus 
group which consists of neiman marcus bergdorf goodman and 
contempo casuals stores it has announced plans to open 10 to 12 new 
neiman marcus stores by 1995 
general cinema also owns about 18 percent of the stock in cadbury 
schweppes plc since 1986 company officials said 
general cinema entered the bottling business in 1968 when it 
acquired american beverage corp which held pepsi franchises in 
miami and northern ohio it subsequently purchased other franchises 
and now has regional bottling facilities in atlanta jacksonville 
fla winstonsalem nc twinsburg ohio and charleston wva 
the companys beverage unit had revenue of about 720 million for 
the fiscal year that ended oct 31

japanese companies are likely to beat their 
american rivals to the market with products that use new 
hightemperature superconductors unless the united states puts 
better organization and more money into longrange development a 
white house advisory panel says 
important profitmaking uses for superconductivity are at least a 
decade away but the united states cannot afford to leave them to 
chance the panel said in its report to president reagan on tuesday 
the panel urged the creation of four to six superconductivity 
consortiums scattered around the country that would unite 
university government and industry laboratories that are working on 
superconductivity 
the consortiums would cost the federal government about 25 
million to 30 million a year on top of the roughly 90 million the 
government already spends on superconductivity research the panel 
said 
in addition the panel recommended an increase of a few million 
dollars a year in grants to universities for basic research 
superconductors can conduct electricity without any loss of 
energy from resistance when they are kept extremely cold raising 
the possibility of more efficient engines and motors faster 
computer chips and improved scientific devices such as particle 
accelerators and magnetic fusion machines 
newly discovered materials are superconductive with less 
refrigeration which makes them cheaper and easier to use 
however the report said some of the hopes for superconductivity 
are overblown for example magnetically levitated trains still may 
not be practical in spite of highertemperature materials said 
ralph gomory the chairman of the panel and the chief scientist of 
international business machines corp 
the proposed consortiums would close the gap between the 
shortterm profit focus of industry laboratories and the longterm 
scientific focus of university laboratories gomory said 
americans are probably neckandneck with the japanese in 
basic scientific research on superconductivity gomory said 
but the report said that in terms of commercial applications the 
japanese effort is better structured than the us both for 
systematically developing new materials and for coupling these 
developments closely to industry 
gomory said important commercial applications are so far off that 
there is plenty of time for americans to catch up 
everybodys just out of the gate ahead or behind doesnt 
matter what matters is whos better structured to run he said 
the committee endorsed the current system under which federal 
spending on superconductivity work is divided among five agencies 
on the science front it said universities should continue to be 
the focal point for research partly because they are best suited to 
train future generations of scientists in the new field 
according to the proposal the consortiums would have a 10year 
lifespan and include 20 or more researchers with perhaps twice as 
many students 
this proposal minimizes the role of government builds on the 
strength of the american university system and strongly involves the 
third essential element industry 
here is what the committee concluded about particular industries 
aerospace new superconducting materials could be used in the 
frigid cold of outer space a relatively small market other uses 
are at least a decade away 
chemicals chemical companies are interested in supplying 
superconducting materials but cannot do so until a market develops 
electronics superconducting materials could be used in 
conjunction with standard semiconductors in hybrid circuits densely 
packed chips probably will need to have superconducting wiring by 
around the end of the century 
power generation there is at least a possibility for the use 
of superconducting materials in underground power transmission in 
transformers and in ship propulsion 
transportation unless materials can be found that are 
superconductive at temperatures well above room temperature the 
impact on the automotive industry appears to be minimal likewise 
magnetically levitated trains are not much more economically 
feasible with the latest highertemperature superconductors than 
they were with lowtemperature materials 
in addition to gomory committee members included ibm scientist 
praveen chaudhari h kent bowen of massachusetts institute of 
technology john foster vice president for science and technology 
at trw inc ted geballe of stanford university ken oshman a 
founder of rolm corp and jr schrieffer of the university of 
california at santa barbara who won a nobel prize for 
superconductivity research

former securities executive boyd l jefferies 
one of the biggest victims of the ivan boesky insider trading 
scandal has begun testimony as the governments star witness in the 
trial of gaf corp and one of its officers on stock manipulation and 
fraud charges 
tuesdays appearance was the first time the former chairman of 
los angelesbased jefferies amp co a key source of evidence in at 
least three major prosecutions of alleged securities fraud has 
testified in open court since he was implicated in the boesky 
scandal nearly two years ago 
jefferies told the court about a series of discussions he had 
with james t sherwin vice chairman of the gaf concerning the 
alleged manipulation of union carbide stock in late 1986 
i had spoken to him quite often jefferies said i learned 
to recognize his voice 
sherwin and gaf a wayne njbased chemical company were 
indicted by a federal grand jury here in july on charges of stock 
manipulation securities fraud wire fraud conspiracy and other 
crimes for their alleged attempt to boost the price of carbide the 
former target of a failed gaf takeover attempt 
the indictment said the motive of the alleged manipulation was to 
a create the false impression that carbide stock was rising drawing 
buying interest from other investors and thereby maximizing gafs 
gain from the sale of a huge chunk of carbide stock it had acquired 
sherwin allegedly asked two unidentified jefferies amp co traders 
to make carbides stock rise by purchasing it and he promised to 
reimburse them for any losses that might occur 
jefferies testified that the brokerage ultimately lost about 
40000 on the carbide transaction jefferies said when he told 
sherwin he was going to send him an investment banking bill to cover 
the loss he said fine 
federal prosecutors said jefferies may be on the stand all week 
in the jury trial before us district judge mary j lowe which 
began early last month gaf and sherwin have vowed to vindicate 
themselves in court 
if convicted on all charges the defendants face severe 
penalties sherwin could receive a maximum sentence of 50 years in 
prison and a 25 million fine gaf faces 15 million in fines 
it is the first case to go to trial in the prosecutions that stem 
from disclosures by boesky the nowimprisoned inside trader who 
turned states evidence and paid the government 100 million in 
penalties in november 1986 
four months later boeskys revelations led them to jefferies who 
negotiated his own plea bargain and promised to cooperate in 
exchange for lenient treatment 
he agreed to plead guilty to two criminal charges for which has 
not yet been sentenced in addition he resigned as chairman of the 
company that bears his name and promised to stay out of the 
securities business for five years 
jefferies has proven to be one of the biggest sources of evidence 
in boeskyrelated prosecutions and is expected to be the main 
government witness in separate cases that have been brought against 
takeover speculators salim b sandy lewis and paul bilzerian

the big three automakers the soft drink makers 
cocacola and pepsico and oil giants exxon corp and atlantic 
richfield co are among the best places for blacks to work a 
magazine survey says 
black enterprise magazine released a list of 35 companies 
tuesday saying those included were chosen for the employers 
commitment to affirmative action and minority recruitment 
earl g graves the magazines editor and publisher said the 
recent waves of corporate downsizing takeovers and restructuring 
have significantly impacted on the numbers of black employees and 
advancement opportunities for blacks in some companies 
but he added our survey clearly indicates there are still 
many in the corporate community strongly committed to the creation

the value of european economic community 
food in storage fell by 56 percent to 54 billion in the year ended 
sept 30 with the amount of surplus butter showing the most 
dramatic decline the 12nation trading bloc said wednesday 
the eecs butter mountain declined by 837000 metric tons to

cereals fell 3 million tons to 107 million tons and stocks of 
powdered milk fell by 708000 tons to reach 14000 tons 
the reduction in the value of the stocks is the result of an 
active policy of selling off cereals butter and powdered milk at 
reduced rates eec commission said 
in recent years the eec has revamped its agricultural policy by 
cutting prices and fixing quotas in the dairy and selected other 
sectors to prevent a buildup of surplus stocks

new orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods rose a modest 03 percent in november overcoming declines in 
the military and transportation sectors the government said today 
the commerce department said orders for durable and nondurable 
goods climbed to a seasonally adjusted 2277 billion up 630 
million from the october number 
orders had increased a sharp 20 percent in october after falling 
19 percent in september 
over the last several months new orders have followed a seesaw 
pattern pushed back and forth by fluctuations in the volatile 
defense and transportation sectors 
defense orders plummeted 167 percent to 89 billion in 
november following a 432 percent increase in october 
transportation orders fell 61 percent to 328 billion with 
declines posted in all subcategories except commercial aircraft in 
october transporation orders soared 104 percent 
excluding the military orders in november rose a strong 11 
percent following a 06 percent gain a month earlier excluding 
transportation orders rose 14 percent in november and 05 percent 
in october 
meanwhile the key category of nondefense capital goods a 
closely watched barometer of industry investment plans rose 30 
percent in november to a seasonally adjusted 357 billion it has 
fallen 07 percent in october and 102 percent in september raising 
concern that the yearlong boom in capital spending was tapering off 
american manufacturers have enjoyed brisk export sales as the 
decline in the value of the dollar has lowered the cost of us 
goods overseas consequently they have increased spending to 
modernize and expand their factories 
orders for durable goods big ticket items ranging from 
toasters to tanks were virtually unchanged in november at 1228 
billion 
however electrical machinery shot up 83 percent on the strength 
of a 262 percent gain in orders for communication equipment most 
of it from the military 
orders for nondurable goods climbed 06 percent in november 
following a 09 percent gain a month before the department said 
gains at chemical plants and textile mills accounted for most of the 
gains 
shipments of manufactured goods were up 05 percent in november 
to a seasonally adjusted 2241 billion

general motors corp executives today rolled out a 
new line of multipurpose passenger vehicles for 1990 and for the 
first time included an oldsmobile mpv in its stable 
william w lane oldsmobile general manager said the utility 
vehicle will give olds the chance to capitalize on the growth in the 
minivan market the trend was started and is dominated largely by 
chrysler corp 
chevrolet general manager bob burger said chevrolets lumina 
oldsmobiles silhouette and the pontiac transport se will be built 
at the gm plant in tarrytown ny 
production of the vehicles is expected to reach 100000 during 
the 1990 model year rising to 225000 in later years burger said 
lane said he expects the minivan market to sell 1 million 
vehicles a year in the 1990s compared with 750000 sold annually 
now 
chevrolet and pontiac currently produce minivans and share the gm 
production on a rough 65 percent to 35 percent basis burger said 
lane declined to speculate on what percentage oldsmobile would 
garner in the new production he predicted most of oldsmobile sales 
would come from crossovers from other manufactuers 
the gm guiding principle he said is he who sells them is the 
one who earns them meaning that sales dictate the production 
split among gm divisions 
lane said oldsmobile decided to enter the minivan business 
because 11 million customers switched from cars to light trucks in 
1988 
among those buyers who crossed over to the light truck market 
34 percent purchased a midsized van he said 
in an elaborate news conference featuring the three mpvs the 
lumina sedan the corvette zr1 the pontiac stinger concept car and 
oldsmobiles aerotech ii gm officials said the company is moving 
forward quickly in aerodynamic design it was the first time gm 
divisions have shared a news conference to unveil new vehicles 
the displays were presented at the north american international 
auto show which opens to the public saturday in detroit fortyone 
other manufacturers are showing off new models designed to attract a

the commissioner of the internal revenue 
service said today the agency is making a major effort to ensure 
that taxpayers receive the right answers when they call the irs 
one of every four answers from the irs were wrong last year 
commissioner lawrence b gibbs acknowledged and weve gone back 
to the drawing board to try to improve accuracy levels 
we hope to improve substantially this year gibbs said as the 
agency launched its annual campaign to urge taxpayers to file their 
returns as early as possible 
the irs has increased the number of supervisors to oversee 
employees who answer technical questions by phone gibbs said a big 
plus he added was the decision to put about 1000 temporary 
telephone assisters on the permanent payroll which has allowed 
the irs to enhance their training 
gibbs said taxpayers who file early are apt to receive any refund 
in three or four weeks late filing can mean a sixweek wait 
assuming the irs encounters no problems such as computer breakdowns 
that plagued the 1985 filing season 
he said the temporary amnesty that allowed taxpayers to pay too 
little of their tax in advance without penalty mainly because of 
underwithholding due to the massive 1986 tax overhaul will not be 
renewed 
we are going back to business as normal urging people to 
get their withholding correct gibbs said there will be 
penalties asserted against those who do not 
gibbs unveiled a series of print and broadcast commercials 
donated by the advertising council aimed at encouraging early 
filing the central theme of the commercials is that taxpayers who 
procrastinate may find themselves in a nightmare of their own 
creation when they have to rush to meet the filing deadline 
most taxpayers will have less to fear with their 1988 returns 
compared with those they filed a year ago gibbs said that is 
because there are relatively few changes in the tax law that affect 
the returns due by april 17 
but there is no doubt that chances of making mistakes increase 
when filers rush into their returns at the last minute without ample 
preparation gibbs said last year taxpayers and irs employees 
combined for an estimated 20 million mistakes 
the agency expects 109 million returns will be filed this year 
up from 107 million a year ago about three of every four will 
generate refunds

orders to us factories for manufactured goods 
increased by a modest 03 percent during november according to a 
government report wednesday that some economists said reflected 
continued but slower economic growth 
buyers placed orders worth a seasonally adjusted 2277 billion 
during the month up 630 million from october orders had risen 2 
percent in october and fallen 19 percent a month earlier 
for the first 11 months of the year orders were up 93 percent 
over the comparable period in 1987 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc of 
lexington mass said the latest report was consistent with the 
other evidence that the economy is certainly still on the upswing 
although slower growth is expected during 1989 
orders for big ticket durable goods items expected to last 
at least three years were virtually unchanged during november at 
1228 billion although there was a hefty 83 percent increase in 
requests for electrical machinery mostly communication equipment 
for the military 
in the volatile transportation and defense industries orders 
were down 61 percent and 167 percent respectively following 
increases in the previous month of 104 percent and 432 percent 
virtually all transportation categories except commercial aircraft 
declined in november 
among nondurable goods orders were up 06 percent to 105 
billion following a 09 percent gain in october the largest 
november increases among orders for nondurable goods were in 
chemicals and textile mill products while the biggest decreases 
were in petroleum products and apparel 
robert g dederick an economist with northern trust co in 
chicago said the slower rate of growth in november indicates new 
orders seem to have lost much of their forward momentum except in 
the civilian aircraft industry 
if you exclude that aircraft orders seem to be in a bit of a 
lull he said the implication is that orders are going to have 
to gather steam if manufacturing is going to continue the pace of 
last year 
dederick said weaker growth is not necessarily bad given a 
federal reserve board preference for subdued growth to stave off 
inflation 
samuel d kahan of kleinwort benson government securities in 
chicago said that while the november increase was modest the 
trend is still up moreover the backlog of unfilled orders 
continues to rise suggesting that growth in industrial production 
still will be fairly good 
he said growth in the fourth quarter of 1988 had been expected to 
be strong but debate still was open on whether there will be some 
kind of slowing in the new year so far the economy keeps chugging 
along 
in the key category of nondefense capital goods which reflect 
industry investment plans orders were up 3 percent much of it due 
to demand for civilian aircraft 
jerry jasinowski of the national association of manufacturers 
said the report indicated a robust order picture for manufacturing 
in general 
we are not getting any reports from manufacturers of any 
slowdown in orders across the broad spectrum in manufacturing 
indicating the capital spending boom is going to continue in 1989 
he said 
shipments of manufactured goods were up 05 percent in november 
to a seasonally adjusted 2241 billion

l william seidman is a lot like a protective 
parent when it comes to the nations banking funds 
nothing gets his guard up more than talk of a proposed matchup 
between his baby the federal deposit insurance corp which 
insures commercial bank deposits and the wayward thrift insurer 
the federal savings amp loan insurance corp 
people keep telling us they have to get married and were 
looking at the bride very carefully said seidman fdic chairman 
for the past three years and one of the most forceful regulators in 
washington 
as he tries to help set the banking agenda for the bush 
administration seidman pronounced seedmun is blunt about his 
feelings on the thrift crisis and opposition to an fdicfslic 
merger which some propose as a step toward solving fslics money 
problems banks though worry such a merger will result in 
skyrocketing insurance premiums 
there was a time when you could have merged the two but a 
merger now will bankrupt the funds seidman said in an interview 
unlike the fdic fslic is technically insolvent due to the large 
number of problemthrift bailouts last year alone fslic spent 
386 billion to help merge or sell 222 insolvent sampls hundreds 
more remain financially shaky 
seidman proposes among other things that the government bite 
the bullet by spending another 30 billion in 1989 to close 100 of 
the sickest thrifts the other problem sampls could be dealt with over 
a longer period of time 
he also wants the government to consider revamping the entire 
deposit insurance system to include new broad powers for his agency 
and splitting fslic from its parent the federal home loan bank 
board 
if i were advising the president i think he should do it 
resolve the thrift crisis early on in the honeymoon days when 
its someone elses problem he said if he waits too long it 
becomes his problem its not a politically attractive issue 
seidmans zeal is understandable he had his own problems after 
taking the helm of the fdic in october 1985 becoming its 14th 
chairman 
for one thing he inherited the fallout from continental illinois 
corps near demise a year before during his tenure seidman has 
contended with more than 600 bank failures including a 
postdepression record 221 in 1988 
the fdic posted its first operating loss last year although it 
remains firmly solvent with a net worth of around 15 billion at 
the end of 1988 
seidman 67 came to the job with surprising little banking 
experience 
at the time of his appointment he was dean of the college of 
business at arizona state university before that he served as vice 
chairman at copper giant phelps dodge corp and a managing parter in 
the accounting firm seidman amp seidman started by his father and 
uncle 
his business acumen and investment savvy also have helped make 
him a millionaire many times over and he has several homes around 
the country including one in hawaii he shares some of his business 
smarts in a justpublished book he coauthored competitiveness 
the executives guide to success 
seidman also is no stranger to republican politics from 1974 to 
1977 he served as assistant for economic affairs under president 
ford a childhood friend from his hometown grand rapids mich from 
1983 to 1984 he was cochairman of the white house conference on 
productivity 
he also ran an unsuccessful campaign to become michigan auditor 
general in the 1960s 
all that experience and my good looks seidman said has 
helped in tackling the banking world there have been some big 
issues to tackle including the latin debt problem the campaign to 
expand into investment banking and lately the debtfinanced 
takeover craze which seidman warns could endanger big lending banks 
my experience says that credibility is the no 1 asset you have 
to have seidman said and telling it like it is is the best way 
to deal with things 
a freemarket advocate seidman has been called a team player by 
those who know him well but hes also not afraid to speak his mind 
for instance at the american bankers association annual 
convention in honolulu last fall a redfaced seidman denounced the 
comptroller of the currency robert l clarke who is on the board 
of the fdic for suggesting that commercial banks prepare for a 
possible fdicfslic merger just the day before the two men held a 
friendly informal news conference 
he seidman feels very strongly that the resolution of the 
thrift crisis should not come on the backs of commercial banks 
said james j mcdermott jr a banking analyst with the investment 
firm keefe bruyette amp woods 
he has been a good steward for the industry at a time when the 
effects of deregulation of the 1970s have caused signficant 
turmoil as shown by the bank failures over the years 
he has been a breath of fresh air 
short stout and nearly bald seidman bares a slight resemblance 
to the late actor william frawley known as fred mertz on the i 
love lucy television series he has the same gravelly voice 
but hes far more physically active than the mertz character was 
enjoying polo and a variety of other sports and not as grouchy 
especially to his six children and several grandchildren 
he knows how to relax its a wonderful gift said his wife 
sally he could have a horrendous day and then he just forgets 
about it when he gets home 
while at work seidman also tries to keep things informal 
remaining accessible to banking analysts and the press if it were 
up to him hed probably be wearing sweat shirts and casual slacks 
to work 
before attending a recent aba dinner in honolulu he asked me 
do you think i have to wear a suit and tie mrs seidman 
confided and i said yeah you better

the world bank is raising interest rates for 
more prosperous third world countries to 765 percent annually the 
first such increase since the bank began lending at variable rates 
in 1982 officials said wednesday 
the rate will apply during the first six months of this year on 
37 billion worth of loans to about 70 countries said sheldon 
rappaport a spokesman for the bank 
for the second half of 1988 the rate was 759 percent the 
increase amounts to only 006 percent but will cost the borrowers an 
additional 11 million rappaport estimated the rate is based on 
the cost of the banks own borrowings and will be recalculated in 
mid1989 the bank gets most of its funds from borrowing on world 
markets 
the bank is owned by 151 governments with the united states 
holding the largest block of shares and is the biggest single 
source of aid to third world countries used to help raise their 
living standards it lends more than 19 billion a year 
when it introduced variable interest rates on most of its loans 
in july 1982 the annual rate was 1143 percent since then the 
rate has been reduced each time it was recalculated twice a year 
the poorest countries which borrow from the banks international 
development association will continue to get loans for 40 years at 
less than 1 percent a year with long grace periods during which 
only interest is due

the nations chief tax collector urged 
americans on wednesday to file returns early this year and said the 
irs for its part will fully respect a new taxpayer bill of 
rights and try to provide filers better advice 
lawrence b gibbs commissioner of the internal revenue service 
said of the taxpayerrights bill at a news conferencewe feel it 
is a good bill and we are going to implement the letter as 
well as the spirit of the law 
the legislation enacted in reponse to scattered reports of 
abuses by irs employees requires the agency to fully inform 
taxpayers of their rights any time an audit is begun other 
provisions extend the notice required before the irs can seize 
property and prohibit the agency from promoting employees on the 
basis of how much they collect 
gibbs acknowledged that irs employees gave the wrong answer to 
one of every four technical questions asked last filing season we 
were not satisfied last year he said and weve gone back to 
the drawing board to try to improve accuracy levels 
we hope to improve substantially this year said robert 
lebaube director of taxpayer services one significant factor he 
said is that the irs was able to put on the permanent payroll 1000 
telephone assisters who in past years would have been hired only 
for the tax season this allowed the agency to intensify the 
training of those employees 
there is a clear correlation between experience and accuracy 
lebaube said 
in addition the number of assisters working under each 
supervisor has been reduced from about 20 to about 12 he said 
gibbs said the irs is convinced that taxpayers who file early 
avoiding time pressures that grow near the filing deadline are much 
more likely to have an errorfree return for that reason the irs 
the advertising council and the news media are combining efforts 
again this year to deliver the file early message 
make your taxes less taxing read the print ads do them 
today 
the television commercials attempt in a goodnatured way to 
scare taxpayers into not waiting until the april 17 filing deadline 
why let it haunt you when you can do something about it asks one 
commercial featuring a howling wind and a bewildered taxpayer who 
might have stepped off another planet 
gibbs said most taxpayers will have less to be confused about 
than they did a year ago most of the hundreds of changes brought 
about by the 1986 tax overhaul showed up for the first time on 
returns filed last year there are very few significant changes 
affecting returns that will be filed this year 
early filers are likely to get any refund within three or four 
weeks gibbs said those who file in late march or april may have to 
wait six weeks or longer 
taxpayers in 36 states who qualify for refunds may be able to 
file their returns electronically this year the remaining states 
will be added next year as many as 2 million returns four times 
the number last year are expected to be filed electronically this 
year gibbs said 
electronic returns must be filed through paid professional return 
preparers from one computer to another this significantly reduces 
irs paperwork 
the agency expects 109 million returns to be filed this year up 
from 107 million a year ago about three of every four will generate 
refunds 
gibbs said the irs will not renew a temporary amnesty that last 
year allowed taxpayers to avoid a penalty when they had too little 
tax withheld from their paychecks 
we are going back to business as normal urging people to 
get their withholding correct gibbs said there will be 
penalties asserted against those who do not 
in general taxpayers have until jan 17 to pay 90 percent of 
estimated 1988 tax liability and avoid any underpayment penalty 
taxpayers with significant amounts of income not subject to 
withholding such as interest and dividends could be subject to 
penalties unless they meet that 90 percent target

when the national football leagues top two 
teams brawl in miami on jan 22 for super bowl xxiii one of the 
unsung heros will be the hybrid grass on the playing field developed 
near this tiny south georgia town 
southern turf nurseries inc a leader in constructing and 
renovating athletic fields and golf courses gave miamis joe robbie 
stadium a stateoftheart playing field last year using a tough 
strain developed at the university of georgias coastal plain 
experiment station in tifton and a patented underground 
moisturecontrol system 
the grass covers spots quickly and is extremely durable but 
plush its used in nearly all new athletic fields and golf courses 
in the southeast said southern turf spokesman steve mathis 
a good athletic field is expensive mathis said we can 
build a field for less than 100000 without drainage but it can go 
to 1 million for a topofthe line baseball field 
omega a rural farming community of 1000 residents has a couple 
of cotton gins and some turnofthe century brick buildings that 
house a grocery store a hardware store and a few other businesses 
during the summer 15 to 18 tractor trailers leave the omega farm 
every day to supply southern turf crews working all over the 
southeast the firm also air freights sod and sprigs around the 
world 
when our little phone rings here in omega it could be somebody 
in hong kong said general manager steve gibson you never know 
who might call 
at the dolphins stadium workers installed a system dubbed 
prescription athletic turf or pat pat fields have a network of 
pipes beneath the grass for irrigating when the soil is too dry and 
removing moisture when it is too wet 
southern turf has installed similar systems at florida state 
universitys stadium in tallahassee and at atlantafulton county 
stadium home of the national football leagues atlanta falcons and 
baseballs atlanta braves 
to install a pat system workers remove the top 12 inches of 
soil level the field and dig a network of shallow ditches that 
provide clearance for the water pipes 
after the entire field is covered with plastic a bulldozer 
pushes sand over the plastic and workers cover the sand with a layer 
of peat moss 
workers use machines to blend the peat moss and sand forming a 
new 12inch layer of topsoil then grass sprigs are planted or sod 
installed 
sensors buried in the field turn the systems pumps on and off 
maintaining proper moisture levels 
most people when they see a field only see the grass said 
mathis the real work is underneath 
artificial turf is more expensive to install and maintain than 
natural grass and it is less popular with players mathis said 
some experts believe artificial turf contributes to sports injuries 
instead of mowing it youre scrubbing it trying to remove the 
blood the chewing tobacco and the beer he said in seven to 10 
years you have to spend another 500000 replacing the rug 
after southern turf installs a grass field its the 
groundskeepers responsibility to maintain it 
the atlantafulton county stadium authority recently ordered 
1200 square feet of sod to repair unsafe and unsightly areas steve 
ortmayer the san diego chargers director of football operations 
described the playing surface as the poorest ive ever seen 
mathis said such comments are embarrassing for his firm and he is 
optimistic the stadium authority will heed the companys suggestion 
to hire a yearround groundskeeper at present the stadium has a 
groundskeeper only for baseball 
we know our job was done right said mathis weve 
recommended on several occasions that they hire a man 12 months a 
year 
since its founding 40 years ago southern turf has planted more 
than 2000 athletic fields and golf courses around the world 
including the augusta national golf amp country club in augusta ga 
where the masters tournament is played the assayegh soccer field in 
riyadh saudi arabia and the royal hong kong jockey club 
customers also include the daytona international speedway the 
gator bowl the orange bowl the new orleans saints hialeah race 
track and many major universitie southeast 
including the university of georgia

braniff inc on wednesday announced a bold stroke 
designed to put the regional airline in closer competition with the 
nations major carriers saying it will acquire 50 airbus industrie 
a320 planes and has options to get another 50 in a deal valued at up 
to 35 billion 
the deal could nearly triple the fleet size of braniff a carrier 
with 53 jets that has endured three changes of ownership a chapter 
11 bankruptcy reorganization a major recapitalization and the 
transfer of its major operations to kansas city from dallas in the 
past six years the airline has vowed to become a more competitive 
force in the industry 
todays announcement i think takes us a giant step forward 
toward making that goal a reality william mcgee braniffs 
chairman told a news conference in new york 
the move also represents one of the largest single orders for 
jets produced by airbus a european aircraft consortium that has 
emerged as a major competitor against the us giants of the 
industry boeing co and mcdonnell douglas corp 
the airbus a320 is a 150seat highly efficient aircraft used 
widely to replace aging jets which requires only two pilots in the 
cockpit rather than the customary three it was unclear how 
braniffs acquisition of these planes would affect previously 
disclosed plans to acquire 23 boeing 737s from amr corp parent of 
american airlines 
its a sizable infusion of new capacity in braniff said 
robert joedicke an airline analyst for shearson lehman hutton inc 
it will certainly allow braniff to rationalize and modernize their 
fleet and be much more competitive 
braniff currently operates 25 boeing 727s 10 boeing 737s and 18 
bac111s built by british aerospace plc 
last june investment group biacor holdings inc acquired 
dallasbased braniff for 100 million from dalfort aviation inc 
which is owned by the pritzker family of chicago through the 
investor group painewebber inc controls a majority stake in the 
airline 
the group appointed five top executives from piedmont airlines to 
manage braniff mcgee who had been piedmonts chairman helped 
build that airline into the nations ninthlargest carrier and one 
of the most profitable airlines before it was acquired by usair 
group inc in 1987 
kevin murphy who follows the industry for morgan stanley amp co 
suggested that the current team at braniff could be beefing up the 
airline in preparation for selling it 
our principal objective is to grow kansas city mcgee told 
the news conference referring to braniffs main hub 
he said the airline may introduce international service from 
kansas city as well as first class service on existing flights 
mcgee said he expects braniff to join the ranks of the airline 
majors as measured by 1 billion or more in annual revenue 
within a year and a half 
the carrier should become profitable by the end of this year the 
braniff chief projected 
another airline analyst who asked not to be identified said 
braniff needs to guard against getting too big the predicament 
which prompted its bankruptcy in 1982 
you dont try to dance with the elephants he said 
mcgee confirmed reports that the deal includes 16 planes 
originally intended for pan am corp which recently decided to 
scrap an order of a320s in exchange for a 115 million payment from 
airbus pan am had a firm order for 16 of the aircraft and an option 
on 34 more 
in a separate statement wednesday pan am also confirmed that it 
had transferred the airbus order to braniff and announced that it 
will buy up to four new airbus a310300 longrange planes instead 
while the a320 is a fine aircraft our current route structure 
and our nearterm scheduling plans do not require introduction of 
this aircraft type at this time pan am chairman thomas g 
plaskett said 
engines for the airbus planes which are included in the price 
will be supplied by iae international aero engines a consortium of 
us british west german japanese and italian engine makers which 
is based in east hartford conn the us partner is pratt amp whitney 
aircraft of east hartford 
the deal would be worth the 35 billion only if braniff 
exercises options to acquire all 100 planes airbus will sell the 
first 42 planes to a financing group which will in turn lease them 
to braniff airbus will have to make its own financing arrangements 
for the other eight in the first group of 50 
the members of the financing group are gpa group ltd of shannon 
ireland an aircraft leasing company which has an option to buy 10 
percent of braniff airbus and the engine supplier iae

borden inc put corporate raiders on notice 
wednesday that if an unwanted buyer tries to chop up the food and 
chemical giant bordens 25 top managers will quit en masse under an 
unusual takeover defense 
we think any potential raider would think twice about losing 
that group at once said rj ventres bordens chairman and chief 
executive officer he added that he believed banks and investment 
houses would be reluctant to loan money or raise funds for such a 
raider 
ventres said the new yorkbased company knew of no takeover 
attempt and that borden already has a poison pill plan designed to 
fend off an unwanted suitor 
instead he told reporters at a news conference the new plan was 
devised to ensure that if such an attempt were made borden 
stockholders would receive what the company considers a fair price 
to determine that price the company first would calculate its 
value through traditional methods such as analyzing cash flow and 
market share to that figure would be added at least half of the 
strategic value that a raider could obtain by breaking up the 
company consolidating production and other efficiencies obtained 
after takeovers he said 
an alternate way of determining fair value would be if the 
takeover offer would result in the cash purchase of 85 percent of 
bordens disinterested shares those not already held by the 
purchaser bordens directors or top management 
if a raider failed to meet either one of those tests the 
people plan would go into effect under that plan if any one of 
the top 25 borden managers were dismissed after a takeover without 
cause all 25 would leave the company 
in other words if a raider took over borden at less than the 
fair price and then tried to sell off one of bordens 
divisions the head of that division would be considered dismissed 
without cause and the 24 other top executives would tender 
resignations the agreements with the 25 would be in force for three 
years after a takeover 
in effect if a bidder refused to pay our shareholders a fair 
price under this new standard it would be difficult for him to 
restructure or sell off parts of the company for a period of three 
years ventres said the moment he tried he would lose the key 
operating management 
ventres said the 25 managers agreed to the plan because they have 
invested an average of 21 years in the company and want it to remain 
independent they also received enhancements in their employment 
contracts he said 
under their previous contracts each would have received two to 
three years pay upon termination after a takeover depending on the 
number of years of service under the enhanced contracts each would 
receive up to three years pay each also would receive a stock 
option equal to his last stock option 
ventres said the total cost of the employment contracts should 
they be terminated upon a hostile takeover and breakup would range 
from 35 million in the first year of the threeyear period when 
each would receive three years pay to 10 million in the third 
year when each would receive a minimum amount 
he rejected characterizing the contracts as golden 
parachutes he said they were standard employment contracts that 
were enhanced slightly under the new plan 
john m mcmillin a food industry analyst at prudentialbache 
securities inc said the plan was unique but questioned its 
effectiveness 
its not really going to stand in the way of an allcash bid 
that the shareholders view as fair he said i just view it as 
another form of a poison pill that might make borden a little less 
vulnerable to a takevoer but i stress the word little 
he added that borden did not seem a likely takover target for two 
reasons its management has done a good job boosting its stock 
price and nearly 40 percent of its sales volume is in milk a 
business in which a company has a hard time controlling the 
marketplace corporate raiders he said usually target companies 
that have a firm grip on their markets 
it does show one thing about borden that there is a 
camaraderie of top managers he said they do emphasize the word 
team they all socialize together its a real good environment 
for 1987 borden had a profit of 267 million on sales of 65 
billion it estimates its sales last year rose to 72 billion the 
company is a leader in the dairy snack food pasta grocery 
products wall covering forest product resins and packagingfilms

if you ever wonder why so much borrowed money can 
go into leveraged buyouts at such high interest rates consider 
this most of it is taxdeductible 
and if you wonder why americans dont save more consider that 
interest earned even on piddling savings accounts at modest rates 
is subject to income taxes 
take the idea a step further 
untaxed money for leveraged buyouts tends to push up interest 
rates simply because borrowers will pay higher rates moreover 
such borrowing may diminish funds available for more productive 
corporate uses 
meanwhile taxes on interesta connecting hub at 
tokyos narita airport 
it flies nonstop to tokyo from los angeles san francisco 
honolulu and new yorks kennedy airport 
although ohare is the worlds busiest airport the chicago 
metropolitan area is unable to take advantage of the growing markets 
of air transportation to asia wolf said 
the situation is unfair to the chicago area and runs contrary 
to the interests of the united states he said 
under uniteds proposal it would fly nonstop from chicago to

models are any indication the cars of the 90s will have a 
decidedly windswept look 
the newly renamed detroit auto show began two days of media 
previews with the introduction of a new luxury car line from japan 
a new domestic minivan and questions about whether the nameplate of 
another japanese entry in the highpriced car niche will be covered 
up in a trademark dispute 
also at the show general motors corp chairman roger smith said 
the worlds largest automaker expected to post a record profit for 
1988 though he declined to give a figure 
gms previous record year was 1984 when the automaker posted 
earnings of 452 billion on sales of 8389 billion for 1987 gm 
had a profit of 355 billion on revenue of 10178 billion 
smith also predicted the big three gm ford motor co and 
chrysler corp would earn a record 11 billion in 1988 though he 
did not break it down by company 
the 700000 square feet of cobo hall lit up with neon videos and 
presentations to show off the products of 41 automakers 
gleaming new cars turned slowly on display platforms as models 
practiced their speeches dancers warmed up at the toyota exhibit 
smoke poured from a dodge truck display and workers put finishing 
touches on carpeting as reporters and company executives wandered by 
the show which opens to the public saturday is used to 
introduce new models and to gauge public interest to futuristic 
concept cars 
the common denominator for the hundreds of cars on display is 
smooth lines some say the streamlined look which clicked at ford 
motor co with the taurus and sable models in 1983 is firmly 
entrenched in automobiles and light trucks 
gm showed off its multi purpose vehicle or minivan for 1990 
that it will market through its chevrolet oldsmobile and pontiac 
dealers 
meanwhile highpriced cars for the 1990s are getting a boost at 
the show nissan motor corp officials unveiled three cars from its 
new infiniti line a twodoor coupe and convertible and a fourdoor 
sedan the cars expected to be in infiniti dealer showrooms in a 
year will range in price from about 22000 to 40000 
the cars are targeted at west german luxury performance cars made 
by bmw and mercedesbenz that often are favored by the 35 to 
54yearold buyer on the way up the financial ladder 
the first aim is the large base of japanese owners who are 
moving up in the 1990s said infiniti general manager william 
bruce 
he declined to predict sales of the cars other than to say they 
are expected to be modest about 100 dealers have been signed up to 
carry the cars which will be marketed separately from nissan cars 
and trucks 
toyota motor corp has scheduled an introduction of its lexus 
luxury car line for thursday but a lawsuit filed by mead data 
central inc could mar the cars unveiling mead claims the lexus 
names infringes on the trademark for one of its computer database 
services lexis 
a federal judge in new york last week issued a restraining order 
barring toyota from using the lexus name but an appeals court 
stayed that order a hearing on extending the stay is scheduled for 
thursday in new york 
the lexus name appears 29 times on signs and cars at the 
companys display at the auto show toyota spokesman kurt von 
zumwalt said arrangements have been made to cover the names if the 
injunction goes into effect

copper futures prices rose sharply wednesday on new yorks 
commodity exchange on supply worries rekindled by the apparent 
bombing of three locomotives in peru and a decline in the exchanges 
warehouse stocks of copper 
on other markets precious metals futures retreated grain and 
soybean futures surged energy futures were mixed cattle futures 
rose while pork futures fell and stockindex futures advanced 
copper settled 31 cents to 63 cents higher with the spot 
contract at 158 a pound and the more actively traded contract for 
delivery in march at 1426 a pound 
the bombing of the locomotives in peru the worlds sixthlargest 
copper producer served to remind traders that the settlement last 
month of a 57day peruvian miners strike did not defuse the 
countrys internal political tensions or the potential for 
disruptions in the copper pipeline 
although no copper was lost in the explosions the issue is 
that it will impede shipments of metals including copper to the 
ports said bette raptopoulos a metals analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
meanwhile the commodity exchange reported a 301ton decline in 
its warehouse stocks of copper to 7964 tons it was the first daily 
decline after more than a week of steady or rising supplies 
indicating that copper consumers have returned to the marketplace 
after a holiday break ms raptopoulos said 
finally copper for march delivery broke through strong 
resistance at 140 a pound which prompted heavy buying by 
speculators who trade based on chart signals the contracts close 
at 1426 a pound was viewed as another bullish technical signal 
said craig sloane an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co 
the markets been in consolidation for more than a month and we 
may be breaking out of it to the upside he said the market has 
the potential here for a significant move if it can just move a 
little higher you could easily be in the 150 to 160 area 
copper futures hit an alltime high of 16475 a pound on dec 8 
precious metals prices fell on the comex in response to the 
dollars strength which was in turn a reaction to the us downing 
of two libyan fighter planes off the libyan coast analysts said 
gold settled 230 to 240 lower with february at 411 a troy 
ounce silver was 86 cents to 96 cents lower with march at 6025 
a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures finished sharply higher on the chicago 
board of trade amid reports and rumors of new export business 
wheat for nearmonth delivery surged to a 7year high above 
447 a bushel on news that china had bought 440000 metric tons of 
us wheat at subsidized prices analysts said 
nearmonth soybeans climbed more than 14 cents a bushel to their 
highest close since oct 5 on rumors that the chinese were seeking 
to buy as much as 1 million metric tons of us soybeans 
and corn futures climbed substantially on rumors later confirmed 
by the agriculture department that the soviet union had purchased 
250000 metric tons of us corn 
wheats an exportdriven market as you get into the latter part 
of the season and with exports being such as they are almost on a 
par with last year that speaks very well of that market said 
grainmarket analyst arthur parrish of shearson lehman hutton inc 
in new york 
wheat settled 4 cents to 8 cents higher with march at 447 a 
bushel corn was 2 cents to 5 cents higher with march at 283 a

wall street giant drexel burnham lambert 
inc has paid a 156334 penalty for failing to register two mutual 
funds with illinois officials before selling shares in the state 
the government said wednesday 
secretary of state jim edgar whose office regulates securities 
dealers in illinois said he believes the penalty is the largest 
ever assessed in the state for failure to register mutual funds 
edgar said the case isnt connected to the federal investigation 
of drexel in new york where the firm is based on dec 21 drexel 
agreed to pay the us government a record 650 million in fines and 
restitution and plead guilty to six felonies to settle a massive 
securities fraud case 
an investigation by the securities department of edgars office 
found that shares in the funds worth more than 205 million were 
sold to illinois residents by the firm beginning in april 1987 
the penalty was calculated on the basis of 106334 in management 
fees earned by the company while the shares were being sold 
illegally the remaining 50000 is a grant from drexel to the 
investor protection and education program administered by the 
securities department 
since paying the penalty the firm has registered the mutual 
funds and shares can now be sold legally in illinois edgar said

nissan motor corp is putting up some 
stifferthanusual dealer requirements for its new infiniti car 
line and much of it has to do with money 
infiniti general manager william bruce said wednesday that it 
would take between 25 million and 5 million depending on land 
cost for a business person to set up an infiniti franchise 
that according to the national automobile dealers association 
is about twice the typical startup cost for getting into the 
automobileselling business 
bruce also said each of the 100 or so dealers who have signed 
letters of intent to handle the new japanmade luxury car are being 
told that their businesses must conform to certain architectural and 
space requirements 
just four cars will be displayed at a time he said each with a 
viewing area separated from the others by japanese screens the cars 
will be shown on stone floors instead of carpet or tile usually seen 
in dealerships and there wont be any bright displays 
when you walk into a showroom you arent attracted by an 
orange backlit thing he said 
despite the restrictions bruce said the company has been swamped 
with applications from potential dealers 
we stopped counting at 1500 applications in the fall of 
1987 he said between 60 percent and 65 percent of those who have 
signed letters of intent are nissan dealers now he said 
and the majority of them are megadealers businesses that 
own two or more showrooms typically megadealers have the cash or 
the credit needed to finance expensive projects like an infiniti 
dealership 
the overwhelming majority are megadealers in the 80 percent 
range he said 
part of the reason for requiring that infiniti dealership 
locations be separate from nissan dealerships bruce said is to 
help identify the luxury car division as a different kind of 
dealership 
we at infiniti will differentiate ourselves from nissan a 
lot he said we will not be looked at as an extension of 
nissan 
the cars certainly are different when the two infiniti models 
a coupe and a fourdoor sedan are in showrooms in about a year 
they will range in price from about 22000 to 40000 bruce said 
firmer prices will be announced later and could change depending on 
the relationship of the japanese yen and the dollar

in 1988 surpassing the 45 billion the nations largest automaker 
made in 1984 chairman roger smith said wednesday 
now we havent added up all of the figures but weve added up 
enough of them that i can tell you right now that gms net income 
for the 1988 calendar year is going to be an alltime record 
smith said 
and not only that we are going into 1989 in great shape 
because we have the lowest yearend stock levels of passenger cars

oldsmobile entered the crowded multipurpose 
vehicle field wednesday rolling out its silhouette multipurpose 
vehicle at detroits annual auto show 
two other general motors corp subsidiaries chevrolet and 
pontiac also unveiled aerodynamicstyled vans for 1990 
chevrolet general manager bob burger said meanwhile that chevys 
new lumina sedan which will go into production this spring for the 
1990 model year will be the car upon which gms future success 
depends 
we know that its going to be a big hit because weve had it 
out there among the people who are going to buy it he said 
william lane oldsmobile general manager said the silhouette 
utility vehicle will give olds the chance to capitalize on the 
expansion of the market for minivans started and led by chrysler 
corp 
burger said chevrolets lumina oldsmobiles silhouette and the 
pontiac transport se which share frame design and windswept 
styling will be built at the gm plant in tarrytown ny 
production during the 1990 model year of the gm minivans is 
expected to reach 100000 rising to 225000 a year subsequently as 
sales rise toward plant capacity 
pontiac general manager michael losh predicted the minivan market 
would increase to 1 million units in the early 1990s from the 
current industry output of about 750000 units a year 
chevrolet and pontiac share the gm minivan production on a rough 
65 percent to 35 percent basis burger said 
lane declined to speculate on what percentage oldsmobile would 
garner in the new gm production burger said the split among 
oldsmobile chevrolet and pontiac would depend on how many vans each 
sells 
oldsmobile decided to enter the minivan business because 11 
million customers switched from cars to light trucks in 1988 he 
said 
among those buyers who crossed over to the light truck market 
34 percent purchased a midsized van he said 
gms was one of a host of briefings by the 41 exhibitors at the

quaker oats co said wednesday it plans to 
sell its ghirardelli chocolate business which quaker acquired in 
1986 as part of its purchase of the golden grain co 
the chicagobased quaker said no specific buyer has been 
identified for the famous chocolate concern which is based in san 
leandro 
but quaker said it has been approached by many interested 
potential buyers of ghirardelli since it was acquired 
ghirardelli which was founded before the civil war is 
profitable but is too small for quaker oats said douglas w mills 
executive vice president of quakers diversified grocery products 
division 
he said ghirardelli does not ideally fit with our existing 
businesses and strategies 
in our view ghirardelli has a great deal of upseide potantial 
but with an owner whose priorities are more focused on the chocolate 
business and specialty retailing mills said 
he said quaker was principally interested in the sidedish brands 
of ricearoni and noodleroni when it acquired golden grain he 
noted the chocolate company represented only 12 percent of golden 
grains sales volume 
ghirardelli founded in 1852 originally made powdered chocolate 
around the turn of the century the company bought a square block 
above what is now aquatic park on the edge of san francisco bay 
that property became ghirardelli square when that tourist 
attraction was opened in 1966 the chocolate company operates the 
ghirardelli chocolate shop and soda fountain and an ice scream 
shop at the site

the government plans price increases of 20 
percent in 1989 and hopes to hold inflation to just over 50 percent 
compared to 7080 percent in 1988 deputy premier ireneusz sekula 
announced wednesday 
sekula told a news conference wages will be allowed to rise 
generally in relation to rising prices but the government will use 
a penalty tax to discourage pay increases it considers inflationary 
he said price increases announced last year would produce a basic 
inflation of more than 30 percent in 1989 even if the government did 
not raise prices this year 
by adding that figure to the planned 20 percent increase in 
prices in 1989 the government sees overall inflation exceeding 50 
percent he said 
this is a clear decrease in inflation though unfortunately 
still substantial sekula said 
prices for basic foods will rise by 12 percent while other goods 
will go up at a steeper pace he said 
he said the government plans to stagger the increases throughout 
the year telephone rates for example went up 40 percent on jan 1 
price increases are a politically sensitive issue in poland 
increases set off worker revolts that led to the removal of 
governments in 1956 1970 1980 and most recently last year when 
zbigniew messner stepped down as prime minister under widespread 
criticism of his handling of the economy 
sekula said the government had to allow for a 1 trillion zloty 
2 billion budget deficit in 1989 to avoid higher price increases 
he said limiting price rises to 20 percent means the government must 
raise subsidies on many goods adding that such subsidies will 
account for more than 30 percent of the budget

a japanese realestate company is close to buying 
the worlds tallest building for at least 12 billion a los 
angeles firm representing the prospective buyer said wednesday but 
the skyscrapers present owner said it wasnt involved in any sale 
negotiations 
sears roebuck and co which put the famed 110story sears tower 
up for sale on oct 31 said speculation that a japanese buyer was 
close to a deal was groundless 
we are compiling a financial analysis which is the first step 
in the offering process sears said in a statement we are not 
involved in any negotiations at this time 
the 14yearold structure which rises 1450 feet above the 
downtown loop is expected to fetch a record price for a us 
building surpassing the 660 million paid by walter shorenstein in 
1985 for the bank of america building in san francisco 
sears has said it is selling the tower as part of the giant 
retailers previously announced restructuring plan but intends to 
keep its corporate headquarters in the building 
jack barthell managing partner of kenneth leventhal amp co of los 
angeles said the prospective buyer was a japanese realestate firm 
that owns highprofile buildings in other cities and already has a 
presence in chicago 
his description prompted speculation that the client was shuwa 
corp a japanese real estate developer with more than 2 billion in 
us holdings including abcs new york headquarters the arco plaza 
in downtown los angeles and the quaker oats tower in chicago 
scott tagliarino a spokesman in los angeles for shuwa investment 
corp a shuwa affiliate said the company generally doesnt 
comment on those things essentially theres no comment 
barthells statements drew a doubtful reaction from cushman amp 
wakefield inc a new yorkbased realestate firm that has 
represented japanese buyers in other large commercial property 
transactions 
i find it hard to believe that one client would risk 12 
billion in one place on one property said john oharenko managing 
partner of cushman amp wakefields chicago office the deal is so 
large that you would probably have to have more than one source of 
capital 
oharenko said the cashrich japanese likely would be involved in 
buying the sears tower but probably in conjunction with a us firm 
direct japanese investment in us commercial real estate in the 
past two years has totaled more than 15 billion said martin sawa 
senior investment specialist in cushman amp wakefields san francisco 
office 
the sharp rise in japanese purchases of top us commercial 
property in recent years a phenomenon linked partly to the weak 
dollar has incited a backlash of resentment that most japanese 
firms would prefer to avoid oharenko said 
barthell said his unidentified client was sensitive to that 
situation but undeterred by it 
they are a very good corporate citizen very philanthropic and 
they are known in the communities in which they do business as an 
outstanding community citizen and leader barthell said i 
dont think theyre put off by the profile and recognition that 
buying the sears tower might give them

venezuelan presidentelect carlos andres perez 
said wednesday he is confident there will be increased cooperation 
from the united states under george bush in helping latin america 
overcome its foreign debt burden 
we will have the opportunity for great american cooperation 
with our countries in latin america great opportunities for 
development said perez who recently had several meetings with 
the us presidentelect 
perez said wednesdays visit with new mexican president carlos 
salinas de gortari is part of a effort by latin american leaders to 
find a reasonable solution to the debt problem 
we seek agreement among latin american countries to find 
reasonable solutions with our creditors perez told reporters 
before speaking to salinas we seek agreement in search of an 
understanding and not confrontation 
venezuela on saturday suspended payments on a large chunk of its 
35 billion foreign debt claiming it was short of money because of 
low prices for crude oil mexico is trying to renegotiate payments 
on its 106 billion debt the second largest after brazil among 
developing countries 
both nations say that debt payments are eating so much money that 
they dont have enough left for investment and economic growth 
perez and salinas also discussed oil a major source of foreign 
revenues for both nations 
our countries have suffered the buffeting of the fall in 
prices but in my meeting with the president of mexico carlos 
salinas de gortari i expressed to him my optimism about the 
possibilities of a stablization of the petroleum market soon 
perez told a news conference wednesday night before leaving the 
country 
he also announced that this week he would travel to brazil for a 
similar meeting with president jose sarney 
venezuela is a founding member of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries a 13nation cartel that has faced trouble in 
bolstering prices 
mexico the worlds sixth largest exporter is not a member of 
opec but follows the cartels guidelines about half the oil that 
pemex the mexican state petroleum monopoly sells abroad goes to 
the united states 
perez said if no solution is found to the debt problem the 
severe economic difficulties currently afflicting venezuela brazil 
and mexico will extend to more countries 
perez said debt negotiations should be bilateral but the 
countries should seek to strengthen our bargaining power through the 
establishment of a single latin american position 
i dont want to turn into a lawyer for the banks but the banks 
are tied by the policies established by the us treasury 
department and the federal reserve and that is why it is 
essential that we ask the us government to change its attitude 
perez said 
perez said he was optimistic opec will be able to keep prices 
from falling further but he described the debt as a vise on the 
economy of venezuela
