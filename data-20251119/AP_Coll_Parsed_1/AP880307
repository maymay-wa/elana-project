national assembly candidate 
luis mejia miranda on monday ridiculed reports he was involved in 
misusing us aid money can you imagine that if i had 2 
million i would still be in this country he asked 
president jose napoleon duartes son denied he was trying to 
protect mejia a fellow christian democrat who was reported under 
investigation in the case 
i deny any tie because i am not protecting him and because i 
am against corruption said alejandro duarte candidate for mayor 
of san salvador in the march 20 elections 
the new york times said sunday that mejia is being investigated 
for allegedly misusing up to 2 million of us aid 
it said the money was part of a 10 million program to assist 
warravaged areas and help win the support of salvadorans in the 
war against leftist rebels 
the newspaper quoted unidentified salvadoran and us officials 
as saying it could be the largest case of theft of us aid money 
during the administration of president duarte elected in may 1984 
for a fiveyear term 
in an interview with local newspapers mejia said that news 
about alleged misuse of funds surprises me because it is totally 
false 
rodolfo castillo claramount duartes vice president and 
secretarygeneral of the governing christian democratic party said 
the article was full of vagueness and imprecisions with the 
political intention of damaging the party 
he said it was written within a strategic conception of the 
ultraright of the country 
he also read a communique saying the party backed alejandro 
duarte as an absolutely honorable capable and honest man 
referring to allegations against mejia the communique said we 
abstain from making a value judgment because we do not know if 
there is evidence 
alejandro duarte denied being an associate of mejia and said he 
had urged mejia to cooperate with any investigation 
it is vital that the truth be arrived at he told reporters 
if he mejia is clean he does not have to be afraid if he 
feels he is outside of the accusations then he should submit 
himself to any investigation 
all this is a dirty political game and i feel indignant for 
having been involved alejandro duarte said 
asked about his relationship with mejia he replied i have no 
personal friendship with him i know him like the majority of the 
members of the party 
the new york times said mejia resigned three months ago as 
director of the national commission for the restoration of areas 
but president duarte agreed to allow him to become a party 
candidate for the national assembly on the recommendation of 
alejandro duarte 
a us embassy source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
these allegations are being studied 
at this time the inspector general of aid the us agency for 
international development has made no determination of bad use of 
funds in this program the source said however other recent 
studies have identified certain aspects of financial control and 
management of conara the restoration commission and since january 
of this year there have been some changes in the method of 
management 
castillo claramount said the party asked for an investigation of 
the alleged theft of funds if there is evidence it occurred the 
party will ask the assembly to remove the immunity merida enjoys as 
a substitute deputy and will ask the electoral council to revoke 
his candidacy he said

two frenchcooking schools one the oldest the 
other the newest are giving the worlds gastronomic capital yet 
another culinary lift 
cordon bleu the oldest and most prestigious has taken on a 
hightech image at a new location in a fivestory building that 
once was an infirmary 
the luxurious ritz hotel the newest is opening its kitchens 
april 5 to students of haute cuisine 
the cachet of the elegant right bank hotel is maintained in the 
decor of its new basement cooking school where gleaming 
whitetiled spaces and handpainted murals set the tone 
the cordon bleu long situated in cramped quarters in the classy 
champ de mars district under the eiffel tower moved in january to 
the building on an anonymous corner of the 15th arrondissement in 
southern paris 
the school where servants from affluent families long ago 
watched cooking demonstrations in an amphitheater now offers every 
hightech amenity including video screens 
both schools offer all levels of instruction up to professional 
despite the new home tradition at the venerable cordon bleu 
remains intact the top diploma at the cordon bleu is awarded to 
students who pass a ninemonth session the ritz schools top 
diploma follows a 12week course 
hardly a newcomer to fine food the ritz has been known for its 
cuisine since auguste escoffier attracted international gastronomes 
early in the century it decided to spread its knowhow as part of 
an overall renovation plan started by mohammed alfayed the 
egyptian entrepreneur who bought the hotel nine years ago 
we feel were offering unique and superior instruction for a 
private cooking school said gregory usher an american who left 
the cordon bleu to take over the ritz schools administration 
our chefs are tops 
the courses are to be supervised by three of the ritzs own 
chefs all winners of the top professional award meilleur ouvrier 
de france most daily courses will be handled by two chefs with 
credentials from prestigious french restaurants one andre 
guillut perfected his english while working at restaurants like 
lorangerie and ma cuisine in los angeles 
the uptodate equipment includes permanently cooled pastry 
marbles the latest in ovens freezers and mixers the hotels meat 
smoker will be used for charcuterie courses and video outlets 
are available for taping recipes 
pupils can browse in a reference library taste wine with the 
ritzs sommelier and the change and shower after the course in a 
special area 
across the seine at cordon bleu in the business since 1896 
its a whole new world 
spanking clean in light greys and blues todays bigscale 
school includes two demonstration rooms four huge cooking and 
pastry rooms and a beautiful winter garden 
equipment includes convection ovens pastryrising ovens and 
huge doughkneaders plus special machines for a new course on 
vacuumpacking and cooking to be taught by patrick martin the 
1987 winner of the french national cuisine and pastry trophy 
were still emphasizing traditional french cuisine said 
robin cahill a cordon bleu graduate and its spokeswoman but in 
our expanded facilities just about everything is new 
the basics are still the main point said chef martin one 
of seven chefs the students will still learn how to chop knead 
whip and do everything else by hand as well 
the overwhelming majority of cordon bleu students are from 
abroad about 30 percent american and 20 percent japanese said 
ms cahill 
while the ritz plans english translations in all courses the 
cordon bleu still teaches its advanced courses in french 
financing for the modernization comes from the pages group 
headed by andre cointreau which bought the school in 1981 
intermediate students at the ritz may choose a onetosix week 
course of practical sessions and demonstrations at cost in french 
francs of about 800 a week the ritzs highestlevel auguste 
escoffier course a 12week session costs about 10000 
cordon bleus main three 12week courses comprise a cycle of 
basic through superior at a cost of about 4200 each 
to get the coveted cordon bleu grand diplome pupils now spend 
nine months reduced from 12 in intensive cooking and pastry 
courses preparing for the big exam at a cost of 19000 
were also offering new intensive fourday practical and 
demonstration sessions ranging from charcuterie to regional 
cuisine and costing about 500 said ms cahill 
both schools conduct wine tasting courses 
a visitor to paris who wants to compare the bigschool ambience 
of the cordon bleu with the tonier ritz can attend demonstrations 
at either one for less than 35 each

militant monks in tibet and restive armenians in 
the soviet union are among the minority nationalities in those 
countries now testing sometimes with violence the limits of their 
governments professed policies of openness 
moscow calls them hooligans to beijing they are 
splittists but to both countries they represent a threat to 
the reputation and unity of the state 
thirtyone people died last week in rioting in the soviet city 
of sumgait in azerbaijan where christian armenians are unhappy 
about being part of mostly moslem azerbaijan in tibet up to 23 
have died in clashes between chinese police and tibetans in october 
and over the weekend 
in both countries the communist governments in the past have 
suppressed their minorities to unite vast tracts of land under the 
ruling ethnic group the hans in china and the russians in the 
soviet union 
josef v stalin purged the ukraine in the 1930s and mao 
tsetung swiftly cracked down on unrest in tibet and moslem west 
china in the 1950s and 1960s 
both countries with china in the lead have now declared 
greater tolerance for different views exposing both to flashpoints 
of nationalist sentiment 
china blames outside forces for its troubles saying 
proindependence supporters of tibets exiled religious leader the 
dalai lama were responsible for the first outbreak of violence in 
the tibetan capital of lhasa last october 
moscow is faced with a wider problem of ethnic disputes in 
armenia religious identity in kazakhstan and political activism in 
the baltic republics of estonia and lithuania 
foreign journalists in china have had slightly better access to 
the troubled areas than their moscowbased counterparts china 
expelled 14 foreign journalists from lhasa last october and has 
since given permission for only a few to return 
but lhasa authorities hungry for tourist spending to help 
chinas poorest province have not stopped group tours and some 
reporters have joined excursion groups to tibet 
the soviet union let a few correspondents go to vilnius 
lithuania on a foreign ministrysponsored trip for a planned 
demonstration to mark the feb 16 declaration of independence 
but reporters there were followed constantly 
no foreign journalist has been allowed lately into armenia or 
azerbaijan telephone calls to yerevan sometimes went through but 
nagornokarabakh the center of the armenianazeri dispute cannot 
be reached at all and sumgait only rarely 
reflecting moscows glasnost and beijings similar policy of 
kaifang the official media in both countries have carried 
limited reports of the disturbances 
chinas press has stressed that only a small number of tibetans 
have joined the disturbances and has sent out a barrage of stories 
about tibetans criticizing the separatists and saying how much 
better life is under socialism 
the government has stressed that it will continue to respect the 
local customs and help alleviate poverty in the regions where the 
nations 67 million nonhan minorities live 
moscow too has linked the rioting to a small number of 
hooligans soviet leader mikhail gorbachev however in a feb 
18 speech stressed the importance of working out a new policy on 
nationalities and said the cental committee would hold a special 
plenary session to discuss the matter

a group of men backing panamas new government 
seized control of the countrys disputed consulate in london monday 
night by smashing through the glass door with a land rover police 
reported 
the british broadcasting corp said the seizure took place 
because the consul in london eduardo arango refused to give up 
his post despite being fired by the new government 
control of panamas embassy in washington is also in dispute 
following the ouster on feb 26 of president eric arturo delvalle 
he was removed from office after he tried to dismiss gen manuel 
antonio noriega the military leader and de facto ruler 
the london consulate is about a mile east of the embassy the 
bbc said arango was not in the consulate when the raid occurred 
police said in a statement that six men two representatives of 
panamanian ambassador guillermo vega and four members of a british 
security firm smashed their way into the consulate 
shortly after this several people left the building 
including three women believed to be secretaries and a number of 
security staff one glasspaneled front door was damaged and no one 
was injured as a result of the incident the statement added 
one of the staff members forced out of the consulate tourism 
commissioner rolando domingo 24 said we were just working in 
there and then suddenly we heard a crash 
he said the land rover broke through the glass doors and then a 
group of men burst into the building carrying large hammers they 
threatened us with hammers and one tried to hit my face they took 
my passport and documents then they pushed me down the stairs and 
out of the building domingo said 
london police sealed off the area around the consulate in tudor 
street in the city londons financial district 
the united states and many other countries still consider 
delvalle the president of panama he was removed from office by the 
national assembly which is dominated by noriega supporters 
the reagan administration has called for noriegas ouster since 
he was indicted in florida last month on drug trafficking charges 
the bbc reported that arango was in panama at the time of 
delvalles ouster and has said he helped smuggle delvalle from his 
residence to a hiding place in the central american country 
the british domestic news agency press association said arango 
received a phone call at home from the consulate staff about the 
monday night raid 
the agency quoted arango as saying he was prevented from 
entering the consulate after the attack and that one of the men 
occupying it had told him they were working for vega and carrying 
out orders from panama 
british government officials said they were told last friday 
that arango was being fired as consul 
arango said he had received letters from panama saying he was 
dismissed but had ignored them press association said 
as workmen repaired the doors one of the british security 
guards who took part in the raid said 
it is an exaggeration to say we smashed in we nudged the 
doors with the land rover the police say they may prosecute us for 
mounting the pavement sidewalk but i dont think they can do 
anything else we were authorized to enter the building but i 
cannot divulge any more 
the four guards involved work for gb security a private 
security company based in south london they said they would be 
guarding the building overnight 
a spokesman at the british foreign office who in accordance 
with british practice declined to be named said it was too early 
to say what action if any foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe 
might take over the incident

at least one policeman was killed and 28 injured 
in tibet over the weekend in clashes between police and protesters 
demanding tibets independence from china the peoples daily 
reported today 
the newspaper the voice of the communist party quoted tibets 
top police official in its report on rioting saturday in the 
tibetan capital of lhasa 
the newspaper did not say how many tibetans were injured 
unconfirmed reports from western sources in lhasa said three to 
nine people were killed including one buddhist monk and two 
chinese police officers 
western sources contacted in lhasa said the city was quiet today 
and sunday but that the jokhang temple around which tibetans 
battled police was closed the sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said stores were open and marketplace stalls were doing 
business today 
in india meanwhile 500 tibetan refugees chanting we shall 
overcome demonstrated in new delhi today against the chinese 
crackdown in lhasa 
police prevented the demonstrators from going to the chinese 
embassy no injuries were reported in sporadic clashes between 
protesters and police 
the demonstration was organized by tibetan freedom movement an 
organization of selfexiled tibetans and the tibetan youth 
congress 
india has allowed 120000 tibetans and their temporal leader 
the dalai lama to stay in india the dalai lama fled to india in 
1959 after an abortive tibetan uprising against the chinese 
the peoples daily today quoted the tibetan police official 
public security bureau chief lang jie as saying on tibetan 
television sunday that the disturbances in lhasa began when 
separatists infiltrated a crowd on the final day of a 10day 
prayer festival he said they started shouting independence for 
tibet and other counterrevolutionary slogans 
lang said 20 to 30 buddhist monks circled the jokhang temple 
shouting slogans and throwing stones and damaging chinese 
television vans the official china news service earlier gave the 
number as 60 
they also attacked the tibetan branch of the buddhist 
association and set fire to a car belonging to the group 
controlled by the chinese government 
their purpose was to destroy the peace and unity of our 
country and our region and the peaceful and prosperous life of all 
nationalities in tibet he was quoted as saying the report did 
not say how many tibetans took part in the riots or if there were 
any arrests 
saturday was the first outbreak of violence since last oct 1 
when 2000 tibetans led by buddhist monks set fire to a police 
station facing the jokhang temple police opened fire and at least 
14 people were killed 
china which claims tibet has been an integral part of the 
nation for centuries moved troops into the remote mountain region 
in 1950 
many tibetans deeply resent the beijing government because of 
oppression of tibetan religion and customs and the destruction of 
temples during the 196676 ultraleftist cultural revolution 
although china has tried to redress past wrongs friction 
remains between the tibetans and the hans chinas ethnic majority 
which continues to hold many senior posts in lhasa 
the official xinhua news agency said today that rioters 
stormed looted and set fire to shops and restaurants and beat up 
policemen sent to maintain order 
it said rioters with steel bars and wooden sticks knocked down 
policemen yuan shisheng and yang yuchen stabbed them and threw 
them from a secondfloor window yuan a 22yearold tibetan died 
later in a hospital and yang was reported in serious condition 
the western sources said tibetans set fire to vehicles and lit 
bonfires over a 12hour period and that police fired tear gas 
during the day to control the violence gunshots were heard after 
dark they said 
the lhasa government has turned down almost all requests by 
foreign journalists to visit lhasa and has restricted tourism to 
the area since the disturbances last october

chanted we want religious freedom after thousands crowded into 
a cathedral for a mass honoring a 13thcentury czech princess who 
renounced royal wealth to serve god 
the mass on sunday at st vitus cathedral in the castle complex 
where communist president gustav husak lives drew about 8000 
people 
it was one of the biggest religious services in the capital 
since the communist takeover in 1948 and an indication of the 
reviving strength of the nations roman catholic church 
dozens of plainclothes security officers were seen inside and 
outside the cathedral while mass was held to honor the princess who 
is to be canonized by the vatican later this year 
police arrested 16 dissidents and religious activists under 
48hour detention orders on friday and saturday apparently to 
prevent them from attending the mass a dissident source said five 
people remained in detention sunday night but four of them were 
expected to be freed today 
augustin navratil a roman catholic activist from moravia was 
detained friday morning but there was no word he was free late

religious freedom that has gained more than 300000 signatures 
making it the largest such action in the soviet bloc since 1945

visit a british diplomat friday and two others also were briefly 
held that night 
after the mass about 1000 people went from the cathedral to 
the nearby residence of cardinal frantisek tomasek a few hundred 
chanted we want bishops we want religious freedom and we 
want the pope 
the chanting crowd appeared to reflect growing discontent among 
catholics at the lack of bishops in 10 of the countrys 13 sees

appoint as bishops members of the statesponsored pacem in terris 
organization a group of priests not recognized by the holy see

falling bond interest rates and unexpectedly 
high tuition increases have forced duquesne university to suspend a 
trendsetting tuition prepayment plan according to school officials 
the small roman catholic university announced three years ago 
that alumni could enroll their newborn children for 4450 as full 
tuition payment for four years of education the plan was expanded 
in 1986 to include nonalumni 
the college takes the money and invests it with the proceeds 
covering tuition for four years of college when the child is grown 
the plan prompted about a dozen other private colleges to follow 
suit six states also adopted plans that would enable parents to 
prepay a fixed amount of the childs college tuition starting at 
birth 
duquesne spokeswoman ann rago confirmed sunday that the 
universitys board of trustees had voted wednesday to suspend the 
plan 
when we began the program it was a much different economic 
climate but things have changed so we decided to suspend it she 
said 
the college will keep its commitment to 622 families already 
enrolled in the program ms rago said 
when the plan was created according to ms rago the 
universitys rate of return on the bonds was 108 percent it has 
since dropped to 852 percent she said 
tuition for 198889 recently was raised 8 percent rather than 
the originally projected 6 percent 
the university found it would be necessary to raise the 1987 
tuition prepayment for a newborn to 8630 that was calculated to 
cover tuition costs of 102604 over four years ending in the year 
2005 
for a 15yearold the onetime investment rose from 12864 to 
24310 
at this time those numbers dont make the plan feasible 
ms rago said the administration will reexamine it if the 
economic conditions change

hungarian intellectuals and a member of 
parliament have called on hungary to allow more ethnic hungarian 
refugees to emigrate from romania and appealed for international 
support in monitoring their rights 
about 20 people spoke at the allday forum sunday in a theater 
in budapest more than 700 people attended the meeting 
participants informed the associated press by telephone from the 
hungarian capital 
the meeting sunday was the second one of the democratic 
forum since the group was formed on sept 27 in southern hungary 
the document issued at the september meeting called for genuinely 
effective reform to resolve hungarys economic and social 
problems 
the meetings are unusual in communist hungary because 
authorities although they have not officially recognized the 
forum have not prevented them from taking place and the results 
have been discussed in the official press 
most of the speakers sunday focused on the ethnic hungarian 
minority in romania 
hungary and romania are warsaw pact allies but have engaged in 
increasingly sharp rhetoric over the question of the ethnic 
hungarian minority in transylvania in recent months 
transylvania was ruled by hungary before world war i and both 
nations claim the area is the cradle of their national cultures and 
history 
hungarian officials say increasing numbers of romanias nearly 2 
million ethnic hungarians have sought refuge in hungary 
geza szoecs an ethnic hungarian poet from transylvania who now 
lives in switzerland suggested that the hungarian government 
consider allowing a certain quota of ethnic hungarians from romania 
emigrate to hungary 
he suggested the quota correlate to the number of hungarians who 
apply for asylum in the west each year as well as the general 
decline of the population through the sinking birthrate 
however zoltan kiraly a member of parliament warned against 
establishing a refugee program that would help romanian communist 
leader nicolae ceausescu get rid of the hungarian minority 
ethnic hungarians have said they are increasingly restricted in 
the use of their language and expression of their culture in 
romania which denies the charges and accuses budapest of meddling 
in its affairs 
kiraly told the gathering he and five other parliamentarians 
drafted a resolution calling on the government to set up a 
settlement fund for transylvanian hungarians who wish to stay in 
hungary 
he said the draft resolution which is to be put before 
parliament when it meets in spring session later this month also 
calls on the government to seek the cooperation of the united 
nations and the international red cross and to mobilize 
international public opinion 
kiraly one of the most outspoken members of parliament said 
many hungarians who enter hungary from romania go on to third 
countries because the hungarian authorities are not prepared to 
receive them 
he said many of these ethnic hungarians if given the chance 
would opt to stay in hungary because of the cultural affinity

survivors and those who lost loved 
ones in a ferry disaster retraced the voyage of the herald free 
enterprise casting wreaths and notes over the spot where it 
capsized a year before 
daddy miss you said one of the more than 100 cards dropped 
into the water sunday a cold bleak day with a fine drizzle 
remarkably similar to the day the herald turned over and 193 of its 
passengers died 
others joined in prayer sunday in this belgian port and across 
the north sea in the english port of dover to mark the worst 
peacetime disaster involving a british ship since the sinking of 
the titanic in 1912 
about 270 set out from zeebrugge and stopped just outside the 
harbor wall where the ferry capsized march 6 1987 when water 
rushed in through its open bow doors five minutes after it left 
port 
for 20 minutes they cast flowers onto the choppy seas from the 
baltic ferry which the heralds owners p and o pressed into 
service for the sad pilgrimage 
some were led away to be comforted by red cross and social 
workers others clung to their families a few went off by 
themselves and stood looking into the murky waters 
on the upper car deck which was transformed into a makeshift 
chapel bedecked with flowers prayers were said by three clergymen 
an anglican a roman catholic and a major from the salvation army 
during a halfhour service 
this service can mark a new beginning said the rev peter 
bowers vicar of st peters and st pauls church in dover it 
does not mean we forget those who we have loved in fact it is 
from that memory that we build a new future 
his words were echoed by the bishop of dover the rt rev 
richard third who told more than 600 bereaved at the anglican 
church of st mary the virgin in dover that it was time to leave 
their grief behind 
it is right to grieve it is healthgiving to express your 
sorrow but you cant go on doing it for a lifetime there must 
come a moment when you surrender your grief when you stop crying 
at st donaas roman catholic church across the road from 
zeebrugge port the sunday service was turned into a memorial for 
the ferry victims 
the rev wim catry also offered prayers that the survivors and 
bereaved would be able to reconstruct their lives he said in his 
sermon that a rose garden and plaque would be unveiled in may in 
front of the church to commemorate the dead 
andrew parker who turned his body into a human bridge so 20 
passengers including his wife and daughter could walk across his 
back to safety paid his own private tribute 
he went out on a belgian tug to the spot where the herald 
capsized and with his 13yearold daughter janice dropped 193 
flowers into the water one by one his wife eleanor like several 
other britons who came here remained onshore unable at the last 
minute to relive their nightmares 
said mrs parker i hate this day i just wish i could take 
it off the calendar

unsponsored afghanistan peace talks resumed 
today with uncertainty persisting over whether pakistan is ready to 
sign an agreement with the sovietbacked kabul government which it 
does not recognize 
resumption of talks came after unprecedented consultations 
between the pakistani government and opposition leaders attended by 
islamabads chief negotiator acting foreign minister zain noorani 
sources close to the meetings held during the weekend in 
pakistan said most of 19 opposition parties urged the government 
not to stand in the way of the proposed pullout of the estimated 
115000 soviet troops helping kabul to fight moslem insurgents 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has said a withdrawal could 
start in midmay if a settlement is signed by next week 
in an interview published today pakistani president mohammad 
zia ulhaq said his country will not budge from its demand for an 
interim government in kabul as part of a settlement 
the gulf news daily reported that zia was optimistic that the 
proposed peace accord on afghanistan will be signed on schedule 
there is no question of the accord not going through allowing 
it to be dropped is no option he was quoted as saying 
upon his return to geneva sunday night noorani said the 
formation of a broadbased transitional government was as important 
as the troop withdrawl in bringing peace to the region 
why should we not insist on an interim government he said 
in response to a question from a reporter at the airport 
last week noorani said pakistan would make up its mind after the 
islamabad consultations on whether to sign a settlement with the 
present kabul government of president najib which pakistan does 
not recognize 
he put up only a cryptic smile when asked again before todays 
session if islamabad was now prepared to sign 
pakistan has insisted that any agreement on the withdrawal 
soviet troops should be linked to formation of an interim 
government that is acceptable to all sides in the 9yearold war 
the islamabad government says this is the only way to ensure the 
safe repatriation of 5 million afghan refugees from pakistan and 
iran 
pakistan has been representing afghan rebels at the 
unsponsored talks which began in 1982 
the resistance movements which say they represent 200000 
guerrillas have rejected any powersharing with afghanistans 
president najib and have presented a plan of their own for an 
islamic government 
the afghan government says its own policy of national 
reconciliation envisages a coalition government open to all 
political forces including the pakistanbased resistance movements 
the soviet union which sent its troops in december 1979 to help 
a faltering marxist government suppress a moslem insurrection no 
longer demands a transitional government be formed before 
withdrawal 
diego cordovez the un undersecretary general who has been 
mediating the afghan talks said last week all major differences 
had been resolved in the first three days of the new negotiating 
round which began last wednesday 
the two sides agreed on a ninemonth timetable for the 
withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan cordovez said this 
agreement following years of stalling on the timetable issue 
represented a significant step toward a final political 
settlement 
the sides also agreed that half of the soviet troops would leave 
in the first threemonth phase the socalled frontend loading 
which had been a major concern of the united states

arab guerrillas in southern israel 
hijacked a passenger bus today and held it for three hours before 
israeli troops stormed it killing three gunmen three israeli 
civilians also were killed and eight were wounded an army 
communique said 
israels staterun radio said the terrorists infiltrated from 
egypt and were armed with fragmentation grenades assault rifles 
and a submachine gun 
a man claiming to represent the palestine liberation 
organizations force 17 phoned a western news agency in jerusalem 
and claimed responsibility for the hijacking 
israel radio said a plo spokesman in tunis told cbs news the 
group was not responsible for the attack but a survivor from the 
bus said she heard the arab gunmen say they were from fatah the 
plo faction headed by yasser arafat 
a special antiterrorist unit and border police stormed the bus 
which was loaded with nuclear plant workers and hijacked near the 
aroer junction eight miles from the dimona nuclear facility 
prime minister yitzhak shamir linked the attack to the rioting 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
these are the same people who incite violence in the 
occupied territories we shall not tire from fighting them 
said shamir 
he noted todays attack was the second infiltration in two days 
three palestinian guerrillas were killed by army soldiers on sunday 
after they tried to cross the lebanon border 
israel radio and officials said the terrorists came across the 
lightly guarded border from egypt at night near ramat nafha and 
commandeered an israeli military automobile at about 7 am 
the arab guerrillas drove the renault4 towards the 
beershevadimona highway throwing a hand grenade at an israeli 
semitrailer but causing no injuries 
the army and witnesses said a volvo bus with the nuclear workers 
was coming from the opposite direction and the gunmen fired at the 
bus and threw grenades until it stopped 
most of the passengers and the driver escaped but a man and nine 
women remained the radio said 
the last bus hijacking inside israel occurred on april 12 1984 
when four bombweilding palestinians hijacked an israeli bus near 
the mediterranean coastal city of ashdod a soldier was killed on 
the bus when israeli troops stormed the vehicle and captured the 
hijackers 
officials at soroka hospital in beersheva said eight women were 
admitted for treatment of gunshot wounds 
police forced the bus to stop after the terrorists fired from 
the bus at passing people and cars police closed the area and 
army officers entered into negotiations with terrorists 
the arab gunmen demanded to speak with representatives of the 
international red cross and also asked for a loudspeaker 
maj gen yitzhak mordechai commander of israels southern 
region decided to storm the bus rather than negotiate further 
after the gunmen opened fire 
we made every effort to both relax them and to promise them 
that negotiations may bring results mordechai told reporters at 
the scene 
but they fired at us twice and afterwards they fired and 
killed one of the hostages and fired at women who were inside the 
bus he said 
in all he said the storming operation lasted about a minute 
mordechai said the man was killed by arab gunmen during 
negotiations he said shots fired by the terrorists when the bus 
was stormed appeared to have killed the women 
the victims were not identified apparently because of the 
sensitivity of their jobs 
at the hospital david a curlyhaired man in his late 20s said 
he saw armed terrorists block the blue volvo bus a special 
commuter vehicle carrying women workers from a plant in dimona 
the terrorists blocked the bus and didnt give the driver a 
chance to turn around and get away he said the driver opened 
the door and many of the passengers scrambled out about a 
halfdozen remained on the bus 
david said the bus hijacking began about 730 am and he 
watched the hijacking from another bus he declined to give his 
last name 
rafi hayon a motorist traveling the beershevadimona highway 
said the arab gunmen armed with sovietmade automatic rifles shot 
at his car when he refused to stop for them 
i saw only two kalashnikovs in front of my eyes he said in 
an interview broadcast by israel radio 
it was the bloodiest attack by palestinian guerrillas since a 
hangglider attack in late november in which a guerrilla landed in 
northern israel and shot to death six israeli soldiers and wounded 
eight 
the dimona plant is at the center of a secret trial now going on 
in israel 
mordechai vanunu a former nuclear technician at dimona 
revealed israels atomic secrets to the sunday times of london in 
an expose published oct 5 1986 based on vanunus information 
the newspaper concluded israel possessed the worlds sixth largest 
nuclear arsenal 
in the sunday times story vanunu detailed the route taken by 40 
blue and white volvo buses he said transported workers to the 
nuclear plant each day 
vanunu 33 was tried on charges of treason and espionage for 
revealing israels nuclear capability and the threejudge panel in 
the closeddoor trial is currently deliberating its verdict

the supreme court said today it will try again 
to decide whether cities may be sued successfully when citizens 
rights are violated due to alleged inadequate training of municipal 
employees 
the justices said they will study the issue in an appeal by 
canton ohio officials 
the city is seeking to kill a lawsuit by a woman who says police 
violated her rights by failing to provide her medical attention 
after she was arrested for speeding 
the justices last year backed out of deciding the 
municipalliability issue in a case from springfield mass 
by a 54 vote the court declined for procedural reasons to 
decide whether springfield should be forced to pay damages in the 
death of a fleeing motorist killed by a policemans bullet 
the ruling left intact a 50000 damage award the city was 
ordered to pay to the victims family 
the case acted on today involves geraldine harris who was 
granted a retrial of her lawsuit by a lower court 
canton officials said alleged inadequate training of police in 
summoning medical help should not be the basis for a lawsuit 
against the city 
mrs harris lawsuit grows out of an april 26 1978 incident in 
which she was stopped for speeding while driving her teenage 
daughter to school 
police said they put mrs harris into a patrol wagon after the 
52yearold woman became upset and uncooperative on arrival at the 
police station the officers said she was lying on the floor of the 
vehicle 
she repeatedly slumped to the floor during a stay of 30 to 40 
minutes at the stationhouse 
police officers did not call for medical help they said they 
believed mrs harris was merely excited and would calm down if left 
alone and permitted to see her family 
when family members arrived they had mrs harris taken by 
ambulance to a hospital where she was diagnosed as suffering from 
stress reaction anxiety and depression the symptoms included 
immobility and difficulty in breathing she was under psychiatric 
care for more than a year later 
the harris family sued the city in federal court and a jury 
awarded 200000 against the city on grounds mrs harris 
unreasonably was denied medical attention 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals threw out the verdict last 
july saying it was unclear on what theory the damage award was 
based 
the judges instructions to the jury could have allowed it to 
decide erroneously that the city was at fault even if the failure 
to summon medical attention was not the result of a city policy 
the appeals court said 
this instruction allows a finding of municipal liability 
merely because the citys supervisory personnel did a bad act 
with no need to find that the city was a bad actor through a city 
policy or custom this was error the appeals court said 
canton officials asked the supreme court to throw out the 
lawsuit 
city officials said the 6th circuit court ruling will allow the 
city to be found liable for misconduct at the retrial under an 
unreasonably broad theory 
the city may be forced to pay damages if the jury decides that 
police were not trained adequately to summon medical help in such 
cases city officials said 
the appeals court ruling will impose the novel requirement 
upon cities that their police forces must provide paramedical 
officers or other trained medical specialists who exercise some 
type of professional judgment at the jail city officials said 
the supreme court recently has had trouble providing clear 
guidelines on the issue of inadequate police training as grounds 
for municipal liability in federal civil rights suits 
in a 71 ruling in 1985 the justices threw out a 15 million 
award against oklahoma city in the shooting death of a tavern 
patron by a police officer 
only four justices agreed it was a mistake for the jury to be 
told it could infer from a single incident that the city was 
grossly negligent in its police training three other justices 
voted to throw out the award for other reasons 
the case is canton vs harris 861088

us navy helicopters dodged heavy 
machinegun fire in the persian gulf and iran today claimed 
responsibility for the attack which came after the helicopters 
ignored a warning to stay clear of an iranian zone 
the account carried by tehrans official islamic republic news 
agency evidently referred to the incident saturday night reported 
earlier by us officials 
they said american helicopters took evasive action when 
fired on from an oil platform and several small boats in the 
central gulf about midnight saturday 
meanwhile us officials said there was no connection between 
the helicopter incident and the movement of six us warships up 
the gulf today 
the ships appearance off dubai triggered speculation that the 
united states was planning to retaliate for the shooting saturday 
all six including a missile cruiser three missile frigates a 
combat stores ship and a chartered navy tanker were part of 
routine movement not connected with any other recent events in 
the gulf said lt col john head a spokesman for the us 
central command 
saturdays helicopter incident occurred as the aircraft were 
scouting ahead of the missile frigate simpson returning up the 
gulf after a convoy escort mission 
a us statement said the helicopters took evasive action and 
did not return fire when the iranians shot at them 
it did not say what kind of helicopters were involved or how 
many there were nor did the statement mention any warning by the 
iranians before they started shooting 
the platform was not identified by name or exact location 
although the statement said it was not the rostam platform rostam 
was shelled by us destroyers last october in a retaliatory raid 
after an iranian silkworm missile hit a us flagged kuwaiti 
tanker the sea isle city anchored off kuwait 
the iranian account said two us helicopters attempting to 
approach an iranian zone in the persian gulf early sunday were 
forced to flee by the antiaircraft fire of naval forces of the 
islamic republic of iran 
it added the navy antiaircraft unit detected the two 
helicopters on its radar and warned them to stay out of the iranian 
zone however the iranian navy fired warning shots after the us 
helicopters violated the iranian zone 
shortly after midnight friday us officials said the missile 
frigate john a moore fired at what were believed to be iranian 
speedboats seen on the radar screen before they disappeared 
also sunday thousands of iranians marched through central 
tehran to the soviet embassy claiming moscow had supplied iraq 
with longrange missiles irans islamic republic news agency said 
in a report monitored in nicosia 
irna said a number of students entered the embassy grounds by 
scaling a wall but were thrown out by alert policemen iran 
said it first learned about iraqs new missiles seven months ago 
and had warned the soviets that any use of the rockets would harm 
relations between tehran and moscow irna said 
in moscow the soviet news agency tass said a mob besieged the 
embassy pelted it with rocks and tried to set fires threatening 
the lives of soviet diplomats and their families similar hostile 
actions were directed sunday at the soviet consulate in isfahan 
iran tass said without elaborating 
tass said the soviet leadership rejects any allegations about 
the soviet unions involvement in the missile attacks against 
tehran 
in the socalled war of the cities irans official islamic 
republic news agency said 12 civilians including women and 
children were killed and 30 wounded when an iraqi missile exploded 
in tehran today it said a clinic several houses and 30 vehicles 
were destroyed in the blast the missile was one of two iraq said 
its army lobbed into tehran early today 
irna said another 61 civilians were killed and 427 wounded 
sunday in iraqi air raids on 16 iranian cities and towns 
it reported that iranian revolutionary guards fired a missile at 
a military center in baghdad around midnight the official 
iraqi news agency said the missile exploded in a residential area 
of the capital killing and wounding a number of civilians 
including women and children

a utah company that provides helicopters and 
crews for a third of the nations civilian air ambulance services 
has been accused of violating federal aviation regulations 
probably unintentionally a newspaper reports 
most of rocky mountain helicopter services alleged violations 
involved paperwork and recordkeeping deficiencies the pittsburgh 
press reported sunday 
the federal aviation administration findings stem from a 
twomonth investigation of the companys safety procedures and 
regulation compliance said wayne barlow director of the faas 
northwest mountain region which covers rocky mountains 
headquarters in provo utah 
the alleged violations are being reviewed and the final number 
could be fewer than the 120 now pending barlow said 
it looks like a case where a small company based in one 
location grew very rapidly to the point where it had aircraft and 
people operating in dozens of states and no real handle on how to 
manage them he told the press 
rocky mountain helicopter the industrys largest vendor 
supplies aircraft pilots and mechanics to hospitals in 39 cities 
including allegheny general hospital in pittsburgh 
barlow said rocky mountain helicopters faces possible fines 
because the investigation uncovered a number of significant 
problems however he said the faa believes rocky mountain is now 
operating in compliance with regulations and the agency had no 
plans to lift their license to fly 
russ spray the companys vice president of emergency medical 
services operations said we dont deny we made some mistakes 
but were fixing them as fast as theyre being pointed out 
the inspection was spawned by congressional pressure on the faa 
last year after a record medical helicopter accident rate in 1986 
but the faa said it also wanted to become more acquainted with the 
medical helicopter industry 
there are more than 235 medical helicopter programs operating at 
least 500 helicopters in 46 states 
what we learn from rocky mountain will help us to manage the 
whole industry better barlow said 
the faas 143page report referred to such shortcomings as a 
lack of documented training in evacuating patients from the 
aircraft in emergencies the press reported 
other alleged violations ranged from a lack of training for the 
companys pilots to the failure of the director of operations and 
chief pilot to have the proper faa licenses for those positions 
the newspaper said 
on feb 12 rocky mountain voluntarily grounded 62 of its 
helicopters until mechanics in each city could confirm all 
maintenance and accompanying paperwork were uptodate and accurate 
in most cases this grounding just took long enough for a 
phone call to each city but three aircraft were grounded for a day 
or so for repairs spray said 
on feb 17 rocky mountain grounded 24 of its pilots because 
they did not have the proper paperwork to show they had received 
required training 
within two days all the pilots were flying legal again 
spray said

a roman catholic bishops conference gave the 
secret service information on an abortion rights group that planned 
peaceful demonstrations during pope john paul iis trip to the 
united states a newspaper reports 
frances kissling president of washington dcbased catholics 
for a free choice said she was surprised by the action 
the information on the group was provided by the national 
conference of catholic bishops sponsor of the papal visit which 
is the religious arm of the civil us catholic conference the 
houston chronicle reported sunday 
i think it is totally inappropriate for the us catholic 
conference to be cooperating with government agencies in the 
collection of data that they know has no relevance to the physical 
safety of the pope ms kissling said 
there has been within the church anincreasing attempt to 
silence and punish individuals who exercise their rights to 
disagree with the bishops on public policy she added i think 
that represents a kind of mccarthyism in the church 
ms kissling said there is no evidence the secret service 
conducted surveillance on her organization 
the chronicle reported sunday it was unclear how or if the 
secret service which was in charge of the popes security during 
the sept 1019 trip used the information about ms kisslings 
group 
richard doerflinger assistant director of the bishops office 
for prolife activities said his 1985 report about catholics for a 
free choice was sent to the secret service along with several 
membership letters and press releases on cfc letterhead that he had 
obtained 
doerflinger said the secret service wanted to be sent any 
materials about groups conducting protests so they would know what 
to expect 
the secret service released the material from its files in 
response to questions from the chronicle under the freedom of 
information act about monitoring of us organizations in 
connection with the papal trip

the supreme court today cleared the way for a 
jury trial in former massachusetts gov edward j kings 36 
million libel lawsuit against the boston globe 
the justices over one dissenting vote left intact a 
massachusetts supreme judicial court ruling that a jury should hear 
kings contention that he was libeled by a nov 8 1981 column 
written by david farrell who since has left the newspaper 
the state court ruled that a jury might conclude that one 
allegation in the column had been published with actual malice 
a reckless disregard for the truth 
justice william j brennan in november blocked a libel trial 
and the full supreme court later refused to set aside brennans 
order 
todays action set aside brennans trialblocking order brennan 
voted to hear arguments in the case but four votes are needed to 
grant such review 
king sued over various globe articles and editorial cartoons 
published in 1981 
the state court threw out most of the exgovernors claims in 
pretrial proceedings but said a jury trial was needed regarding 
the farrell column both the globe newspaper co and farrell were 
named as defendants 
in it king was criticized for treating legislative and judicial 
figures as if they were his employees 
that condescending attitude never was more evident than in 
october when king called a judge and demanded that he change a 
decision he rendered in a gangrape case the column said 
in a muchpublicized case the judge had given a suspended 
prison sentence to five men who pleaded guilty to rape 
kings lawsuit said no such conversation between king and the 
judge took place 
state treasurer robert q crane a king political ally said in 
pretrial testimony that he was farrells source about kings 
telephone call to the judge 
but the states highest court noted that farrell was not told 
that crane had overheard the conversation and that farrell did not 
investigate further 
the court said a jury conceivably could conclude that farrells 
failure to do so amounted to actual malice 
public figures who sue for libel must prove that the allegedly 
libelous statement is false and was made with actual malice 
private citizens have a less stringent burden and must prove only 
that the statement is false and was made negligently 
in a pretrial deposition farrell said he had no reason to doubt 
cranes veracity and accuracy 
in the appeal acted on today globe lawyers said the 
massachusetts court ruling mutates actual malice into negligence 
thus eviscerating the freespeech protections the supreme court 
has built into libel law since 1964 
as long as writers are exposed to liability solely for the 
asserted inadequacies of their investigations speech protected 
under the constitution will be chilled the newspapers lawyers 
said stories for which reliable sources exist may be 
selfcensored out of existence 
but lawyers for king urged the court to reject the appeal and 
allow a jury trial on the libel allegation 
farrell had obvious reasons to doubt the accuracy of cranes 
report they said 
the newspapers appeal was supported in a 
friendofthecourt brief submitted by the american newspaper 
publishers association the american society of newspaper editors 
and other news organizations 
the case is globe newspaper co vs king 87731

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reinstating the death sentence of a florida man convicted of 
killing an 8yearold girl in 1978 
the court is expected to use the case to study death row 
inmates right to raise new issues when they turn to the federal 
courts for help and to decide whether florida juries may be told 
their lifeordeath recommendations are subject to the trial 
judges approval 
aubrey adams who once worked as a corrections officer at the 
marion correctional institution in ocala was convicted of the jan 
23 1978 strangulation of trisa gail thornley near ocala 
his conviction and death sentence have been upheld three times 
by the florida supreme court the nations highest court refused to 
review his case twice 
in the second federal court appeal adams in early 1986 
challenged statements made to the jury by the judge in his state 
court sentencing trial 
under florida law a jury recommends life or death for convicted 
murderers in capital cases the presiding judge is free to follow 
or disregard the recommendation 
in adams case the judge told jurors about that aspect of the 
states capitalsentencing law the final decision as to what 
punishment shall be imposed rests solely upon the judge of this 
court the jury was told 
adams argued that such jury instructions run afoul of a 1985 
supreme court decision in which the justices ruling in a 
mississippi case said a death sentence is invalid if a jury is 
misled about its role in determining whether the defendant actually 
will die 
in the case a mississippi prosecutor had told jurors they 
should not view themselves as determining life or death because 
their sentence would be reviewed automatically by an appeals court 
the supreme court said such a statement misled the jury and 
rendered the subsequent death sentence cruel and unusual 
punishment 
a federal judge dismissed adams 1986 appeal but the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals last nov 13 threw out his sentence 
the appeals court said the judges instructions to jurors 
violated the supreme courts 1985 decision adding that adams was 
entitled to a new sentencing proceeding before an untainted 
jury 
in the appeal acted on today florida prosecutors noted that the 
florida supreme court previously had rejected an appeal in which 
adams mounted an identical challenge to the judges instructions to 
jurors 
they asked the justices to resolve the conflict between the 
states highest court and the 11th circuit court 
the states appeal also contended that adams challenge should 
not have been allowed because he did not raise it in his first 
federal court appeal

the supreme court today refused to free 
churches from having to comply with state financialdisclosure laws 
when waging public referendum campaigns 
the court citing the lack of a substantial federal 
question turned away a challenge by 13 churches from jackson 
tenn to a law they contend violates their freedom of religion and 
freedom of speech 
the tennessee law also affects other nonpolitical organizations 
that decided to campaign for or against issues that appear on 
election ballots 
the controversy arose during an august 1984 election held in 
jackson to determine whether establishments within the city would 
be allowed to sell liquor by the drink 
the local option referendum was defeated by a vote of 6514 to 
6474 a 40vote margin 
the 13 area churches nine of them baptistaffiliated took 
varying steps to make public their opposition to allowing 
onpremise liquor consumption in jackson 
the churches spent a total of 5150 mostly for advertising in 
opposition to the referendum but they failed to register as 
political campaign committees as required by the tennessee 
campaign financial disclosure act of 1980 
the law defines such committees as any combination of two or 
more people making expenditures to support or oppose any 
candidate for public office or measure it requires that the 
committees designate a political treasurer and file 
campaigndisclosure statements 
the churches sued the state to challenge the law as applied to 
them 
at trial pastors for the churches testified that the referendum 
opposition resulted from moral not political concerns and that 
they considered their actions to be part of the churches religious 
mission 
the pastors also testified that their churches had not and 
would not get involved in partisan political campaigns as a matter 
of religious conviction 
a state trial judge ruled against the churches finding that all 
of them are political campaign committees as defined by the 
1980 state law and that the law is constitutional 
a state appeals court later overturned the state law as a 
violation of constitutional freespeech rights 
the tennessee supreme court last may 26 ruled that the law does 
not violate freespeech rights when applied to either partisan 
elections featuring candidates or nonpartisan referendum elections 
the recent history of campaign financial abuses as well as the 
growth and possible dominance of special interest political action 
committees make the states disclosure requirements necessary to 
allow the public to have some gauge by which to assess the sources 
content and frequency of campaign publicity and activity the 
state court ruled 
its ruling did not discuss the churches argument that the law 
violates their right to exercise freely their religious beliefs 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the 13 churches noted 
that the justices have never passed on the validity of disclosure 
requirements in referendum campaigns 
the appeal questioned whether any state may justify prior 
registration and disclosure requirements to nonpolitical 
organizations in general and churches in particular 
tennessee attorney general wj michael cody urged the high 
court to reject the churches appeal 
the fact that this is a referendum election does not make the 
states interest in providing any information to the voters as to 
how the election is financed any less compelling cody said 
the 13 churches who challenged the law are bemis pentecostal 
calvary baptist englewood baptist first assembly of god first 
baptist church of bemis first baptist church of jackson malesus 
baptist north jackson baptist northside assembly of god poplar 
heights baptist skyline church of christ west jackson baptist and 
woodland baptist

tennessee sen albert gore jr in tuesdays democratic presidential 
primary in georgia 
nunn dga in a statement released sunday by aides as he was

steps our nation must take to meet our challenges at home and 
abroad 
nunn had refused on friday during a news conference with georgia

conference he had eceived a number of inquiries from georgians 
asking me privately whom i had favored in the march 8 primary

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that the public has no right to attend hearings into the alleged 
tainting or bribing of a criminal trial jury while the trial is 
underway 
the justices without comment refused to secondguess the 
validity of conducting such hearings in secret during the 1986 
racketeering trial of louisiana gov edwin w edwards 
a federal appeals court in upholding the closed hearings ruled 
that the publics constitutional right to attend criminal trials 
does not extend to the midtrial questioning of jurors 
the appeals court also ruled that transcripts of the closed 
hearings may be withheld from public disclosure during the trial 
even if the jury is sequestered and that the names of the jurors 
involved may be erased from the transcripts 
after a 1985 trial ended in mistrial because a federal jury 
could not reach a unanimous verdict thengov edwards and four 
codefendants stood trial again in 1986 on charges of racketeering 
and bribery 
all were acquitted after a twomonth trial 
on two occasions during the second trial us district judge 
marcel livaudais jr received reports that the sequestered jury had 
been tainted 
the first report suggested that one juror had told another that 
jury members in edwards first trial were paid to vote for 
acquittal 
the second report suggested one juror had told another of a 
possible bribery attempt by one defendant 
in both instances livaudais conducted proceedings in his 
chambers and determined that the people involved could continue 
serving as jurors 
courtroom spectators including news reporters were given only 
vague accounts of why the hearings were held the judge said he 
would release partial transcripts sometime after the trial was 
completed but that those transcripts would not include juror names 
three news organizations the timespicayune gannett news 
service and capital city press and several of their reporters 
challenged the judges use of closed hearings 
the timespicayune is a new orleans newspaper capital city 
press publishes the morning advocate and statetimes newspapers in 
baton rouge 
the challenge contended that livaudais should have given the 
reporters a chance to argue in favor of conducting opencourt 
hearings and that he was required to tell why it was necessary to 
conduct the hearings in secret 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals last july 31 upheld the 
closed hearings 
the appeals court noted that past supreme court rulings have 
established a public right of access to criminal trials but ruled 
that under that constitutional right no presumption of openness 
attaches to proceedings involving midtrial questioning of jurors 
if the questioning of impaneled jurors were held in open court 
there is a substantial probability that what may have begun as a 
tempest in a teapot will end in a mistrial a hung jury or a 
reversal on appeal the 5th circuit court said 
the news organizations then sought supreme court review 
the case is timespicayune publishing vs edwards 87872

communist rebels ambushed and killed 
six filipino sailors assigned to subic naval base 10 miles from the 
usrun installation the military said today three civilians 
also died in the shootout 
philippine officials today urged president corazon aquino to 
develop a unified negotiating strategy before talks on the future 
of american bases in the philippines 
one of the countrys bestknown rebel priests fled to cebu city 
from mindanao island after he was wounded by comrades who learned 
he was planning to surrender officials said today 
the philippine constabulary said the philippine sailors were 
traveling to manila sunday when rebels opened fire on their land 
rover near the town of hermosa on the bataan peninsula 
three civilians were killed in the cross fire during the 
15minute battle the military said there were no reports of rebel 
casualties 
subic 50 miles west of manila is one of six installations 
technically under philippine command but effectively under us 
control 
communist rebels operate near both subic and clark air base 
about 50 miles north of manila in october last year rebels killed 
three americans and a filipino of us extraction in coordinated 
attacks outside clark 
cabinet secretaries and members of congress foreign affairs 
committee told reporters after a twohour meeting today with mrs 
aquino that they would continue talks to firm up the government 
position on usrun bases 
the united states and the philippines are expected to begin 
talks in the next few weeks on the future of the usrun 
installations under the current agreement either government can 
unilaterally close the bases if it serves oneyears notice after 
sept 16 1991 
mrs aquino says she will honor the current bases treaty but has 
refused to say whether she will agree to extend the agreement any 
extension beyond 1991 requires approval by twothirds of the 
23member philippine senate where opposition to the bases is 
strong 
sen leticia shahani said matters to be discussed in the review 
include the future of filipino employees at the bases and the 
possibility that nuclear weapons are being stored at the facilities 
she said mrs aquino is leaving us the liberty of taking a 
stand on the other hand there is a need to coordinate the 
positions of the executive and the legislative 
romeo capangpangan spokesman of the department of social 
welfare said the rebel priest rev frank navarro sent word that 
he was recuperating in a cebu area hideout and wanted to surrender 
and be granted amnesty 
navarro has been identified by the military as a new peoples 
army commander in eastern mindanao 
capangpangan said navarro was apparently suffering from a bullet 
wound in the shoulder which he received in an ambush by his own 
followers last week in mindanaos surigao del sur province 
welfare department official amelita costas told reporters that

the supreme court today refused to reinstate 
charges against 36 people arrested outside the white house while 
protesting reagan administration domestic and foreign policies 
the court without comment left intact rulings that dismissed 
the charges on grounds government prosecutors acted vindictively 
a demonstration for peace jobs and justice occurred april 
22 1985 about 200 participants were arrested 
they were charged with violating the terms of their us park 
police march permit by sitting down on sidewalks outside the white 
house 
most of those arrested agreed to pay a 50 fine for 
demonstrating without a permit rather than stand trial 
but 36 demonstrators chose to stand trial they were charged 
in addition to demonstrating without a permit with obstructing 
the sidewalks adjacent to the white house 
each charge carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison 
and a 500 fine 
us district judge aubrey robinson ordered all charges against 
the 36 dismissed ruling that prosecutors acted vindictively by 
bringing the second charge only for those who chose to stand trial 
the us circuit court of appeals upheld robinsons decision 
last year 
the appeals court said there was ample evidence for robinson to 
conclude that prosecutors added the second charge to punish 
demonstrators for choosing to stand trial 
a large group of defendants threatened to go to trial on what 
the government considered petty offenses the appeals court said 
the government had a strong incentive to try to keep clear of 
this courtroom morass it wished to avoid the annoyance and expense 
of prosecuting these minor cases at a potentially drawnout trial 
prosecutors showed a disturbing willingness to toy with the 
defendants the appeals court added 
it said robinson was justified in throwing out both charges 
against the 36 demonstrators not merely the second accusation that 
they obstructed the sidewalks 
if in cases of vindictive prosecution the trial court judge 
may only dismiss the additional charge the prosecutor wil have 
nothing to lose by acting vindictively the appeals court said 
the reagan administration said the lower court rulings could 
significantly hamper the governments handling off mass 
demonstrations in the nations capital 
the case is us vs meyer 87730

the supreme court today refused to revive a 3 
million lawsuit by author william peter blatty against the new york 
times for the treatment his 1983 novel legion received on the 
newspapers weekly best seller list 
the justices without comment let stand a california supreme 
court ruling that dismissed blattys lawsuit alleging intentional 
interference with prospective business advantage 
blatty author of the exorcist contended that the times 
excluded legion from the weekly list for a period even though 
the newspaper knew the novel had sold enough copies to qualify 
the california supreme court by a 70 vote last dec 29 said 
blatty could not pursue the lawsuit 
four of the state courts justices based their ruling on the 
federal constitutions freespeech protections and the even greater 
protections for speech offered by the california constitution 
they said such a lawsuit is barred unless a defendant has made a 
statement of and concerning the plaintiff 
three of the state courts justices said blatty had failed to 
suggest that the newspaper intentionally misrepresented the results 
of its bookstore sales survey to hurt him financially 
the case is blatty vs new york times 861803

the supreme court today cleared the way for a 
trial in what may become an important test case on the power of 
cities to control rents and otherwise protect mobile home residents 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by santa barbara 
calif officials aimed at killing a lawsuit by the owners of a 
mobile home park who claim they unfairly are being deprived of 
their propertys full value 
a santa barbara ordinance adopted in 1984 requires mobile home 
park operators to offer their tenants leases of unlimited duration 
it also permits a maximum yearly rent increase of 3 percent or 
threefourths of the increase in the consumer price index 
whichever is greater 
the ordinance was challenged by william and jean hall who own 
the los amigos mobile home estates in santa barbara 
they said their property is being taken without the just 
compensation required by the constitution 
the halls argued that granting mobile home owners a perpetual 
lease allows them to sell the lease at a windfall profit the 
windfall is due to the new owners anticipation of continued low 
land rent at belowmarket rates the halls said 
a federal judge threw out the suit but the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals reinstated it in 1986 
the appeals court noted that the halls said the price of mobile 
homes in the park shot up dramatically after the ordinance was 
enacted suggesting the guaranteed low rents were worth a premium 
to buyers 
reduced to its essentials the appeals court said the 
halls claim is that the santa barbara ordinance has transferred 
a possessory interest in their land to each of their 71 tenants 
this interest consists of the right to occupy the property in 
perpetuity while paying only a fraction of what it is worth in 
rent 
the appeals court acknowledged that the ordinance allows mobile 
home owners to be removed if they dont pay the rent or if they 
misbehave that may ease the economic impact the appeals court 
said but it does not alter the basic right of possession given the 
home owners 
the ordinance changes the fundamental relationship between the 
parties giving landlord and tenant complementary estates in the 
same land the appeals court said 
the appeals court said a trial is necessary to determine if the 
halls allegations about a windfall are accurate 
santa barbara county and other cities in california joined in 
asking the high court to review the case the cities are berkeley 
capitola carson cathedral city fontana hayward los altos los 
angeles mountain view oxnard palm springs rancho mirage 
rialto san buenaventura san jose san luis obispo santa monica 
vacaville vallejo west hollywood and westlake village 
the justices on feb 24 expanded the power of communities to 
impose rent controls by upholding a san jose calif ordinance 
that allows hardships to tenants to be considered when landlords 
seek rent increases 
the ordinance had been atttacked as a robin hood law that 
steals from the rich to pay the poor 
the case is santa barbara vs hall 87220

jordan said today it welcomed the us 
peace initiative but insisted that the plo participate in talks to 
quell violence in the israelioccupied territories 
information minister hani khasawneh said amman will be 
reporting to the us administration as soon as we finish our 
consultations with other arab countries on the peace plan carried 
to the middle east last week by secretary of state george p shultz 
we always seek a united arab stand toward any peace process in 
the area he said 
he said there was no deadline for formulating a response to the 
us initiative shultz reportedly has asked jordan syria egypt 
and israel to report back by the middle of the month 
the american plan calls for an international conference to 
launch bilateral talks between israel and a palestinianjordanian 
delegation 
the two sides would start in may to negotiate limited selfrule 
for the 15 million palestinians and in december would begin talks 
on a final settlement of the arabisraeli conflict 
israels coalition government is split along party lines over 
the american plan 
the blueprint outlined by shultz proposed an international peace 
conference involving jordan syria and palestinian representatives 
but not the palestine liberation organization 
both the united states and israel refuse to meet with the plo 
because they consider it a terrorist organization 
the jordanian minister renewed jordans call for an 
international peace conference under un auspices and attended by 
all concerned parties in the conflict including the plo and the 
soviet union 
asked if jordan was optimistic he said we cant say so yet

the supreme court today refused to hear the 
appeal of a florida woman who says she was denied custody of her 
young child because she is a jehovahs witness 
the justices without comment let stand state court rulings 
that bar rita mendez from exposing her daughter to any of her 
religious beliefs 
the state courts also awarded primary residential custody of the 
girl to her father 
in the appeal acted on today mrs mendez said her 
freedomofreligion rights were violated by the custody 
determination 
rita and ignacio mendez were divorced in miami in 1985 after a 
fouryear marriage their daughter rebecca was then 3 
marital difficulties arose in 1983 over mrs mendezs 
involvement with the jehovahs witnesses religion her husband is a 
catholic who according to court documents felt his wife had 
betrayed him by joining the jehovahs witnesses 
at a custody trial mendez testfieid that it was not in 
rebeccas best interest to be raised as a jehovahs witness of the 
485 pages in the divorce proceedings transcript devoted to child 
custody 249 pages contain references to the subject of religion 
two psychologists and one psychiatrist testified that rebecca 
should live with her mother whom they called the childs prime 
parent figure 
but the experts said contact with her mothers jehovahs witness 
religion was not in rebeccas best interest because she needs to 
adapt herself to the mainstream of culture 
they testified that a catholic upbringing would allow her to 
adapt to society and have the freedom that catholic children have 
in the society 
judge phillip k knight in awarding primary custody of rebecca 
to her father ruled that mrs mendez should enjoy regular 
frequent and liberal visitation access and contact with the minor 
child 
but he also barred mrs mendez from exposing rebecca to any 
religious practices attendances teachings or events which are in 
any way inconsistent with the religious teachings and practices of 
the catholic religion 
a state appeals court upheld the custody award ruling that 
the record in this case does not support mrs mendezs 
contention that the trial court made the father the primary 
residential parent solely because the mother is a practicing 
jehovahs witness 
in a dissenting vote one appeals court judge said granting the 
father primary custody amounted to an abuse of discretion 
the child exposed to the religious views of both parents for 
two years showed no evidence of emotional or psychological harm 
the judge said adding that the custody proceedings showed the 
experts personal biases against the mothers religion 
their disdain for the mothers religion induced them to 
speculate as to the possibility of harm to the child in the future 
even though no evidence of harm existed the dissenting judge 
said 
lawyers for mrs mendez told the justices this court cannot 
eliminate religious bigotry in america but it can and should review 
this decision which has deprived a parent of her child because of 
intolerance of her faith 
the appeal added the trial courts order places rita in the 
anomalous position of having a constitutionally protected right to 
speak to total strangers about her religion but not to her own 
child 
the case is mendez vs mendez 871166

there were differences in culture and style in a 
television linkup between soviet and american students and 
scholars but the students and 10 panelists agreed that the two 
countries are making progress in breaking down barriers 
the twohour forum saturday joined 350 undergraduates at tufts 
universitys downtown campus with 200 moscow state university 
students 
not accustomed to the american style of tv answers the soviets 
often strayed from the questioning and read prepared speeches 
detailing minor points in soviet nuclear history 
at one juncture soviet moderator yevgeny p velikhov said 
its a lecture we have to teach the students something here 
andrey kokoshin deputy director of the institute for usa and 
canada told a us questioner the superpowers are moving past cold 
war tensions to begin to clear off layers of mutual fears 
it seems to me what we are doing now in a first step to 
disarmament should create a new basis a new faith to increase 
trust in each other kokoshin said 
the satelliterelayed space bridge forum was the first of 
three between tufts and moscow state on the nuclear arms race and 
cold war politics the sessions are part of a course devised by 
tufts professor martin j sherwin 
the panel included two americans who worked on the topsecret 
manhattan project that developed the first atomic bomb in 1945 and 
a soviet researcher who helped build that countrys first nuclear 
weapon in 1949 
students and scientists frequently interrupted each other with 
applause the loudest when sherwin praised soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs efforts to ease nuclear tensions 
i think theres not a single person here who thinks he will be 
able to survive a nuclear bomb said alexei milayev a soviet 
physics student we are gathered here in the final analysis to 
think about what must be done to prevent a nuclear war 
velikhov vice president for physics and mathematics for the 
soviet academy of sciences noted the forum came 40 years after the 
un committee on atomic energy abandoned its effort to ban nuclear 
weapons 
today we are at the first stages of a nonnuclear world he 
said velikhov said the recent superpower arms reduction treaty 
signed in december is the first encouraging step we believe in 
a new international situation we will succceed in resolving the 
question 
mark anstendig 21 a tufts junior history major from edgemont 
ny said afterward the forum went a long way to promoting better 
understanding 
i think there was good rapport on both sides he said 
itll promote better feelings i think its a good microcosm of 
what could happen

the government announced plans today to 
amend the constitution to make it easier to extend direct federal 
rule in troubled state of punjab where sikh militants have been 
waging a bloody campaign for independence 
p chidambaram deputy home minister told the governing lower 
house of parliament the amendments would only apply to punjab 
he said the amendments would allow the government to extend 
direct federal rule for more than the one year presently allowed by 
the constitution 
punjabs state government was dismissed in may 1987 for failing 
to curb sikh terrorism and the state was placed under federal rule 
for six months the duration was extended for another six months 
on sunday the federal government went a step further and 
dissolved the state assembly paving the way for fresh elections 
chidambaram said articles of the constitution dealing with 
emergency rule will be amended to enable the government to impose a 
state of emergency on one state at a time 
under the current rules a state of emergency can be imposed on 
the whole country but not on individual states 
at least 391 people have been killed in punjab this year in 
attacks blamed on sikh extremists more than 1000 people were 
killed last year 
the minister citing a government report on punjab said the 
state assembly was dissolved because of the interference from 
members of the legislative assembly in the effective and efficient 
working of the police 
there were numerous reports he said when legislators not 
only attempted to interfere influence and prevent the police 
action but also threatening police officers of dire consequences if 
they failed to obey their commands chidambaram said 
he claimed the imposition of direct federal rule had brought 
about a distinct improvement in the situation in punjab 
the formal bill proposing the amendments is likely to come at 
the end of the month it is expected to pass easily since the 
congress party of prime minister rajiv gandhi has a majority in the 
lower house

the supreme court today left intact a 113 
million jury award to an idaho boy paralyzed from the waist down 
after he was given a vaccination for three diseases 
the court without comment rejected arguments by the vaccine 
manufacturer that such verdicts could force drug companies to 
abandon the production of essential vaccines 
lederle laboratories which makes the vaccine said the case is 
a test of how far juries should be allowed to go in compensating 
people who suffer injuries after taking vaccines designed to 
protect them from lifethreatening deiseases 
at stake are billions of dollars because of the unprecedented 
explosion of vaccine liability litigation said lawyers for 
lederle a division of american cyanamid co 
lederle manufactures triimmunol a vaccine to immunize children 
against diptheria tetanus and pertussis the company noted that 
the vaccine is licensed by the food and drug administration and 
that only one other company markets a similar vaccine in the united 
states 
kevin toner of burley idaho was given the vaccine in 1979 when 
he was three months old he subsequently contracted a rare 
condition of the spine known as transverse myelitis which 
permanently paralyzed him from the waist down 
a federal jury found that lederles vaccine caused the boys 
paralysis and decided that the drug company was negligent for 
failing to develop an alternative vaccine that would have been 
safer 
lederle contended that the judges instructions to the jury were 
indadequate because the jurors were not told that certain drugs are 
unavoidably unsafe and that such vaccines may be sold despite the 
risks 
the company also said the verdict was impermissibly inconsistent 
with the jurys rejection of other claims against lederle 
the company said the jury in rejecting the other claims 
decided that triimmunol was not defective and that there are 
unavoidable risks in taking the vaccine 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals last september upheld the 
jury award 
in rejecting the companys argument on inconsistency the 
appeals court said it is not beyond peradventure that the jury 
thought that triimmunol was fit for the purposes for which it was 
to be used but that lederle was negligent in failing to replace it 
with a better product 
the appeals court added were we charged with deciding whether 
jury verdicts are the most sensible way of allocating risks and 
costs regarding vaccines that have been proved beneficial we might 
well design a different method 
but it said the jury verdict did not violate idaho law adding 
that any comprehensive reform in the area must be left to state 
legislatures 
the appeals court opinion was written by anthony m kennedy who 
became a supreme court justice in february 
the courts brief order today did not say that kennedy 
disqualified himself from considering the appeal his participation 
under the circumstances would be highly unusual 
the case is lederle laboratories vs toner 871151

the supreme court today refused to allow an 
indian tribe to withhold from federal officials confidential 
records of a tribal court proceeding 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that gave the 
government custody of court records of the red lake band of 
chippewa indians in minnesota 
the tribe in 1985 declared that records of proceedings before 
its court of indian offenses are confidential and not the federal 
governments property 
the chippewas were concerned that if the documents were given to 
the interior departments bureau of indian affairs the agency 
would be forced to surrender the material to a newspaper that 
sought the records under the freedom of information act foia 
indian tribes are not covered by the foia and may not be forced 
directly to reveal confidential information to the news media 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled last august that the 
bureau of indian affairs is entitled to the material 
the appeals court rejected arguments by the red lake band that 
only congress could grant the government access to the records and 
ruled that the government has sovereignty over tribal courts 
despite the absence of specific congressional authorization 
the considerable independence given tribes to govern themselves 
does not mean they have the power automatically to withhold 
information from the government the appeals court said 
the red lake band court of indian offenses was established in 
1884 under authority granted to the tribe by federal officials 
the 8th circuit court said that if the chippewa court had been 
created under a later federal statute the indian reorganization 
act of 1934 the confidential records might be exempt from federal 
control

the supreme court today refused to reinstate a 
pennsylvania law forcing state police officers to retire at age 60 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the state 
law violates federal restrictions against discrimination based on 
age 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled last june that 
pennsylvania violated the federal age discrimination in employment 
act 
the appeals court said it is illegal to presume that officers 
over 60 are physically unfit for their work when officials have 
failed to adopt minimum fitness standards for all workers 
until minimum standards are developed implemented and 
enforced the pennsylvania state police cannot justify its 
mandatory retirement law by relying on good health and physical 
conditioning as reasonably necessary to pennsylvania state 
police business the appeals court said 
the appeals court noted that new jersey a neighboring state of 
pennsylvania has a mandatory retirement age of 55 for state 
troopers that has been upheld in the courts 
but the appeals court said all members of the new jersey 
state police are subject to mandatory fitness requirements and are 
sanctioned for noncompliance 
the federal law against age bias generally permits employers to 
force workers to retire before 70 only if it can be shown that 
being under 70 is a bona fide occupational qualification or if 
employers can prove it is highly impractical to test workers 
individually to assure they are still fit 
the supreme court in a pair of 1985 rulings that reinforced the 
employment rights of older workers struck down efforts to force 
city firefighters to retire at age 55 and flight engineers at age 
60 
the 3rd circuit court cited those cases in invalidating 
pennsylvanias mandatory retirement age for state police officers 
pennsylvania officials said the appeals court ruling places a 
heavy financial burden on the state 
the state said it could be forced to pay 4 million in back pay 
and benefits to officers who have been forced to retire 
officials also said that testing state police officers for 
fitness would be a costly process they said it would cost some 
24 million to determine whether the forces 4000 members are 
healthy and fit 
the state said its retirementage policy is reasonable because 
of statistics that show a sharp decline in average fitness and 
health for older people 
for example the state said the decrease in aerobic capacity for 
an average group of men aged 26 and an average group of men age 58 
is 57 percent relative strength declines by about 35 percent 
between the ages of 29 and 50 and muscular endurance slips by 30 
percent between ages 30 and 60 the officials said 
pennsylvanias retirement law was challenged by the federal 
equal employment opportunity commission and otto j binker a 
lieutenant on the state police force who was near age 60 in 1983 
when the suit was filed 
the case is pennsylvania vs equal employment opportunity 
commission 87958

the widow of former cia director william j 
casey testified today before the special federal grand jury that is 
investigating the irancontra affair 
sophia casey likely was questioned about what her husband might 
have told her before his death last year about the sale of us 
arms to iran to obtain the release of american hostages and whether 
he mentioned anything about the diversion of proceeds to the 
contras 
casey who died of pneumonia on may 6 1987 after suffering 
from brain cancer was cia director when us arm were sold to iran 
in 1985 and 1986 
the agency provided logistical support to covert operations to 
help the contras those operations were coordinated by former 
national security council aide lt col oliver l north 
north told congress that he was acting with caseys approval and 
that the former cia director recommended that he recruit retired 
air force maj gen richard v secord to set up the private supply 
network because secord had experience in special operations 
secord who set up secret swiss bank accounts to funnel private 
donations to the contras also helped broker the sale of us arms 
to iran with his partner albert hakim 
north told congress last summer that casey saw the diversion as 
part of an effort to create a standalone or offtheshelf 
enterprise that could engage in covert activities outside 
congressional review 
mrs caseys testimony comes as the grand jury appears to be 
preparing to return criminal indictments against the targets of the 
investigation including north secord hakim and former national 
security adviser john m poindexter 
mrs casey who lives in roslyn harbor ny last fall disputed 
a published account by journalist bob woodward that casey knew 
about the diversion to the contra rebels 
in his book veil the secret wars of the cia woodward said 
that during an interview in the hospital casey acknowledged knowing 
about the diversion 
in a sept 28 1987 interview mrs casey said her husband 
never told her of the diversion and expressed doubt that he knew 
about it 
she termed absolute blasphemy woodwards account that casey 
had criticized president reagan as lazy and distracted 
hes lying about that mrs casey told the associated press 
she described her husband as a team player and a great 
patriot who would never do anything to harm his president 
mrs casey also expressed outrage at woodwards report that 
casey was struck by the overall passivity of the president 
bill would never say that about the president she said 
bill loved reagan and they were very close its been very 
hurtful

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether states may use antiracketeering laws to close down adult 
bookstores 
the court said it will review a pair of freespeech challenges 
to such an indiana law 
under indianas racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations 
law patterned after the muchused federal rico act law 
enforcement officials are authorized to seize any property used in 
a racketeering enterprise 
the law was invoked in march 1984 against three fort wayne 
bookstores selling sexually explicit materials each accused of at 
least two violations of the states obscenity laws 
law enforcement officials padlocked the stores and seized their 
nventories 
a short time later similar legal action was taken against three 
adult bookstores in indianapolis

the three indianapolis bookstores also have gone out of business 
later two bookstores in howard county ind were prosecuted 
under the state law 
an indiana appeals court ruled in 1985 that applying the state 
rico law to those whose only offenses are alleged obscenity law 
violations impermissibly hinders constitutionally protected freedom 
of speech 
the appeals court said the padlocking of the bookstores 
represented an impermissible prior restraint of materials not 
yet ruled obscene 
the indiana supreme court last year reversed the appeals court 
ruling that applying the rico law in such a way is valid because 
the legislature did not pass it to promote censorship 
the seizure order does not constitute a prior restraint or in 
any other manner impinge upon fort wayne books freespeech 
rights the state court said in a 32 ruling 
in other action the court 
agreed to consider reinstating the death sentence of a florida 
man convicted of killing an 8yearold girl in 1978 
the court is expected to use the case to study death row 
inmates right to raise new issues when they turn to the federal 
courts for help and to decide whether florida juries may be told 
their lifeordeath recommendations are subject to the trial 
judges approval 
left intact a 113 million jury award to an idaho boy 
paralyzed from the waist down after he was given a vaccination for 
three diseases 
the court without comment rejected arguments by the vaccine 
manufacturer that such verdicts could force drug companies to 
abandon the production of essential vaccines 
ruled unanimously that financially troubled farmers may not 
avoid foreclosure under federal bankruptcy law by promising to use 
their labor experience and expertise in continuing to operate 
their farm 
by an 80 vote the court said a secured creditors right to 
adequate protection under bankruptcy law cannot be satisfied by 
such a promise 
refused to free churches from having to comply with state 
financialdisclosure laws when waging public referendum campaigns 
the court citing the lack of a substantial federal 
question turned away a challenge by 13 churches from jackson 
tenn to a law they contend violates their freedom of religion and 
freedom of speech 
let stand a ruling that the public has no right to attend 
hearings into the alleged tainting or bribing of a criminal trial 
jury while the trial is underway 
the justices without comment refused to secondguess the 
validity of conducting such hearings in secret during the 1986 
racketeering trial of louisiana gov edwin w edwards 
cleared the way for a jury trial in former massachusetts gov 
edward j kings 36 million libel lawsuit against the boston 
globe 
the justices over one dissenting vote left intact a 
massachusetts supreme judicial court ruling that a jury should hear 
kings contention that he was libeled by a nov 8 1981 column 
cleared the way for a trial in what may become an important 
test case on the power of cities to control rents and otherwise 
protect mobile home residents 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by santa barbara 
calif officials aimed at killing a lawsuit by owners of a mobile 
home park who claim they unfairly are being deprived of their 
propertys full value 
in seeking help from the nations highest court in the adult 
bookstore case lawyers for fort wayne books argued that neither 
interim nor permanent restraints of the type involved in this case 
may constitutionally be enforced prior to final judidical 
resolution unless the law guarantees speedy appellate review 
the appeal noted that as yet no trial has been held to determine 
whether any of the materials seized from fort wayne books were 
obscene and therefore not constitutionally protected 
the justices were told that a growing number of states are 
adopting similar rico laws and there is a conflict among the 
states as to their constitutionality 
the adult bookstore cases are fort wayne books vs indiana 
87470 and sappenfield vs indiana 87614

hundreds of irate retirees rallied in 
the streets today as local banks remained shuttered and panamas 
ousted vice president urged his countrymen to take up arms against 
gen manuel antonio noriega if the military leader didnt step down 
meanwhile a spokeswoman for the panama canal commission said 
ships were passing normally through the waterway despite reports 
that the nations crisis was holding up passage of ships through 
the canal 
about 300 retirees chanting justice were joined by scores 
of younger supporters who cut off traffic on the citys main 
avenida espana in front of the towering national bank of panama 
building 
we little old people dont have that much strength but well 
hold out here as long as we can said violeta sanchez 63 a 
retired secretary 
at least 200 more retirees gathered in front of the treasury 
ministry to demonstrate 
noriegas regime under increasing pressure from the united 
states tried to assure the countrys 60000 retirees over the 
weekend that they would be able to cash their pension checks for 
the first two weeks of march but it did not say how or where and 
the pensioners were indignant 
rafael arosemena president of the national bank came out of 
the building to try to placate the retirees and was surrounded by 
an antagonistic crowd he told them they should go to another 
branch but they refused to do so 
later in the morning the government radio station said the 
national bank would set up two payment booths in the afternoon to 
cash retirement checks 
banks fearing a run because of political instability closed last 
week 
the government blames the closures on lack of funds resulting 
from the freezing of panamanian government money deposited in five 
us banks 
panamas official currency is the us dollar and the 
government periodically receives shipments of tender from the us 
banks where it keeps an estimated 50 million on deposit 
a request for such a shipment last week was rejected because of 
legal action taken on behalf of eric arturo delvalle who was 
ousted from the presidency on feb 26 
panama canal commission spokesman willie friar said the rumors 
that ship traffic through the canal was being disrupted began with 
unconfirmed reports that panamanian port authorities which have 
been independent from the canal commission since 1979 were 
accepting payment only in cash 
she said other forms of payment were being accepted for port 
services such as bunkering taking on fuel or water 
she also said the great majority of the three dozen vessels that 
make the passage on an average day do not use the port facilities 
she said all 38 vessels scheduled to make the passage sunday did 
so and that the 39 scheduled to pass through today were proceeding 
normally without delay 
on sunday roderick esquivel panamas ousted vice president 
said from hiding that if noriega does not relinquish power 
panamanians should take up arms against him 
in an interview with the associated press from a house where he 
was staying esquivel warned sunday 
if peaceful means and the economic measures are not sufficient 
to achieve democracy then i am the first to say that democracy 
must be obtained by fighting for it 
esquivel was ousted from office in a militaryorchestrated coup 
on feb 26 along with delvalle who also remains in hiding the two 
men were removed from their posts a day after delvalle tried to 
fire noriega 
many people think panama does not have much capacity for 
violence but it does he said 
the education ministry postponed the start of public school 
classes until further notice teachers were to have returned to 
school from vacation today for a week of preparation with students 
beginning classes march 14 the ministry said in a statement the 
postponement was due to the climate of crisis 
panamas 12 local banks have been shuttered since last tuesday 
branches of international institutions closed their doors on friday 
the national bank of panama said it could not supply its member 
banks with tender and instructed them on friday to remain closed 
until further notice 
people have not been able to cash checks since feb 29 and 
stores have stopped accepting checks and credit cards 
the entire population is prepared to suffer economic 
hardship esquivel said of mounting economic pressure from 
washington and in a second phase they are ready to sacrifice 
their lives

potential liability problems 
surrounding a tree house that extends two feet over public property 
have prompted city officials to give the structure the ax 
its accessible to the public and there is the possibility it 
could entirely or partially fall on somebody passing by or damage 
property said chief building inspector louis kidwell 
the 8by6foot tree house was built by teresa macdonalds 
father a contractor a few months ago as a christmas present for 
her sons james 6 and joey 4 
it features walltowall carpeting a shingled roof and sliding 
plexiglass windows and is a popular place for neighborhood children 
to play 
if i didnt have school id spend every single day up 
there said james macdonald 
my dad said whatever happened to the days of huckleberry 
finn and tom sawyer said teresa macdonald 
she said she understands the citys concern but added that few 
people use the sidewalk on their deadend street 
ive been up there on the windiest days and nothing has 
happened she said wed have to have an earthquake or a 
nuclear war 
the macdonalds have until march 21 to remove the tree house if 
the city doesnt change its mind they will build a foundation for 
it in their back yard and place it there

the supreme court in an important victory for 
investors today placed a heavy burden of proof on companies that 
are sued for denying they are holding merger negotiations after 
such preliminary talks are underway 
by a 42 vote the court said if companies withhold important 
information affecting stock prices it must be presumed that 
investors who bought and sold the securities were relying on that 
information 
an investor who buys or sells stock at the price set by the 
market does so in reliance on the integrity of that price said 
justice harry a blackmun for the court because most publicly 
available information is reflected in market price an investors 
reliance on any public material misrepresentations therefore may 
be presumed 
the absence of a fivevote majority in the case raises the 
possibility the issue could be reconsidered by the justices in 
another case with a different result but for now at least 
todays decision is likely to have important repercussions on wall 
street 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the court last month did 
not take part in considering the case chief justice william h 
rehnquist and justice antonin scalia disqualified themselves from 
participating without explanation 
the court ordered further hearings in a dispute involving basic 
inc of cleveland 
the company merged with cebas inc a subsidiary of combustion 
engineering based in connecticut in december 1978 
stockholders said basic executives falsely denied for 14 months 
prior to the merger that at least preliminary talks were underway 
between the two companies 
as a result many investors said they sold their stock at far 
less than its value 
combustion engineering is a conglomerate that makes alumina or 
acidbased refractories nonmetallic ceramic substances used as 
structural materials both basic and combustion engineering were 
traded on the new york stock exchange 
the stock of basic was selling at well under 20 a share when 
merger rumors began surfacing in late 1977 there was a dramatic 
increase in the volume of activity in the stock accompanied by a 
sharp runup in price the eventual merger price of the stock was 
46 a share 
company officials repeatedly said they could not account for the 
activity and denied merger negotiations were underway 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals ruled in 1986 that public 
statements by basic management during the period leading up to the 
merger were misleading or untrue even if the companys denials of 
negotiations might be correct technically 
the supreme court today rejected the appellate courts reasoning 
that the companys denial of the preliminary talks by itself 
created grounds for the investors to win their suit 
information about a company that is otherwise insignificant does 
not become important or material to the stocks value solely 
because the company denied existence of the development blackmun 
said 
materiality is something to be determined on the basis of the 
particular facts of each case blackmun said materiality 
depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on 
the withheld or misrepresented information 
using that standard the court ordered further lower court 
hearings in the suit by investors in basic who said they lost money 
because facts were withheld from them 
blackmun said the presumption at the new hearings must be that 
the investors would have relied on those facts unless the 
management of basic can prove otherwise 
where materially misleading statements have been disseminated 
into an impersonal welldeveloped market for securities the 
reliance of individual plaintiffs on the integrity of the market 
price may be presumed blackmun said 
he was joined by justices william j brennan thurgood marshall 
and john paul stevens 
justice byron r white in an opinion joined by justice sandra 
day oconnor said the ruling may have many adverse unintended 
effects as it is applied and interpreted in the years to come 
for example white said many investors in basic who are now 
suing may have doubted the companys denials that preliminary 
merger talks were underway 
such investors the savviest of the savvy will be able to 
recover under the courts opinion white said 
the case is basic inc vs levinson 86279

republican presidential contenders bob dole and jack kemp 
invoked president reagans name today trying to stem a george bush 
tide on super tuesday as the democrats focused on texas the day 
beore the most delegaterich showdown in political history 
in washington a federal judge dismissed gop candidate pat 
robertsons 35 million libel suit against a former congressman who 
questioned his korean war record 
gov michael dukakis of massachusetts the leader in polls of 
texas and florida democrats met with senior citizens at a north 
miami beach condominium development 
on sunday he campaigned in spanish as he appealed to hispanic 
voters in texas and then flew to georgia where he met with former 
president carter 
robertson was in texas and told an audience in abilene the 
frontier that beckons us today is the energy frontier 
the former television evangelist got the endorsement of diane 
denman vice chairman of the texas republican party who said she 
knows all the candidates but without a doubt ive got more 
confidence that it is pat robertson who will provide the unswerving 
commitment to the conservative beliefs that are needed to see 
america into the 1990s 
dole told a news conference in atlanta that polls do 
demonstrate that i beat all the democrats he bush doesnt beat 
any of them were trying to continue to reaganize the 
republican party to let it grow 
kemp struggling to survive after finishing no better than third 
in any contest so far told an audience at louisiana state 
university i think the republican party wants a reagan 
republican progressive conservative to be nominated and frankly 
george bush bob dole and pat robertson dont qualify 
we are in the race insisted kemp brushing aside questions 
of how well he had to do on tuesday to survive 
while dukakis met with carter sen albert gore jr of tennessee 
picked up backing from another influential georgian sen sam nunn 
as the georgia senator left for a weeklong trip to the soviet 
union his office released a statement saying he had cast his 
absentee ballot for gore because his views come closest to my own 
views as to the steps our nation must take to meet our challenges 
at home and abroad 
four of dukakis rivals jesse jackson gary hart rep richard 
gephardt of missouri and gore were in texas today as was 
robertson bush was ending his campaign day in his hometown of 
houston 
texas which votes with 19 other states on tuesday offers a 
trove of 183 democratic delegates and 111 on the republican side 
in washington us district judge joyce hens green signed a 
brief order dismissing robertsons libel suit with prejudice 
which means that former rep paul n mccloskey jr rcalif is 
legally the victor in the dispute 
robertson accepted the condition the judge imposed on friday in 
a onesentence letter from his attorney douglas v rigler that was 
delivered to the judges chambers by messenger 
under terms of the dismissal robertson must pay court fees 
printing costs and court reporters fees but not mccloskeys 
attorneys fees which he has said total about 400000 
this is a confirmation of my integrity mccloskey said today 
in a telephone interview from his home in san francisco i dont 
like at the age of 60 to be called a pathological liar all over the 
united states he is admitting that he is the one who is the liar 
dole conceded sunday he was involved in a long hard fight 
for the gop nomination and he had little cause for optimism about 
his prospects on tuesday when 17 states hold republican primaries 
and 20 hold democratic contests 
there are 712 republican and 1307 democratic delegates at 
stake including the four to be selected from american samoa 
southern and border states dominate the day and william brock 
doles campaign manager said bush held a 21 or a 31 lead in 
virtually every southern state 
the vice president demonstrated his strength in the region on 
saturday when he overwhelmed his rivals in the south carolina 
primary and swept the states 37 delegates 
on the democratic side dukakis looked strongest with leads in 
surveys in texas and florida the two biggest super tuesday states 
and a lock on his home state of massachusetts which also votes on 
tuesday 
it could be hell come out of super tuesday the 
frontrunner said a gephardt aide of dukakis 
but carter during his meeting sunday evening with dukakis 
predicted no clear winner on tuesday 
jacksons support in the black community gives him the biggest 
southern base of any candidate interviewed sunday on the abc 
program this week with david brinkley he said im running 
strong in the south but he refused to predict how many delegates 
he might win in the region 
gore appeared on the same program and conceded he needs to win 
more than his home state of tennessee on tuesday he predicted he 
would carry several other states but refused to say which ones 
robertson was interviewed on the nbc show meet the press and 
said that if he doesnt get 200 to 300 delegates on tuesday it 
will be difficult 
the vast super tuesday landscape was too much for any candidate 
to cover in person millions of dollars was being spent to reach 
voters through television and radio commercials with many of the 
candidates trying to sell themselves by attacking their rivals 
gephardt commercials accused dukakis of dirty tricks against 
other democratic contenders while the massachusetts governor was 
running an ad showing an acrobat doing flips a pointed reference 
to gephardt shifts on issues 
dole continued to run commercials attacking bush for his role in 
the irancontra affair while the vice president was portraying the 
kansas senator as straddling on taxes

two noted sex experts who criticized health 
authorities for failing to stress the extent of the aids epidemic 
said today that their own estimates of the spread of aids were 
based on beliefs and estimates not scientific evidence 
we did not project our own database on to the general 
population said robert kolodny coauthor with william masters 
and virginia johnson of crisis heterosexual behavior in the age 
of aids 
kolodny said at a press conference this morning that the 
authors assertion that aids is now running rampant in the 
heterosexual community was an estimate based on analysis of 
existing studies that have appeared in scientific journals it was 
not based on original research by the authors he said 
masters asked for his justification of the claim said i 
simply believe it 
the authors criticized health authorities for failing to stress 
the threat of aids to heterosexuals and they have themselves been 
criticized by an aids expert for making recommendations that might 
alarm the public 
but in their book masters johnson and kolodny say that medical 
experts have played down their findings rather than present 
worstcase scenarios in the understandable wish to avoid mass 
panic 
the book calls for widespread mandatory testing for acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome infection by pregnant women couples 
seeking marriage licenses and hospital patients between ages 15 and 
60 
excerpts from the book are appearing in this weeks issue of 
newsweek magazine the authors run the masters and johnson 
institute in st louis and wrote a bestseller human sexual 
response 
but some aids experts questioned their conclusions on the spread 
of the deadly disease 
masters and johnson may have expertise in sexuality but they 
have no credentials to justify their recommendations concerning 
aids public health policy recommendations that will surely alarm 
the public said mathilde krim founding chairwoman of the 
american foundation for aids research 
from everything we know today such mandatory testing schemes 
will not help protect the public she said saturday 
masters and johnsons book suggests that to guard against 
infection potential sexual partners undergo tests and remain 
monogamous 
dr beny j primm a member of president reagans aids 
commission said he agreed that recent optimistic reports about 
heterosexuals could lull people into a state of complacency 
he said as a result many dont use condoms still are 
promiscuous and still participate in group sex or other dangerous 
activities 
the book disputed estimates that there are now about 15 million 
people infected with the virus in the united states 
it is quite likely that there are now 3 million or more 
carriers of the aids virus in the united states most of whom are 
otherwise healthy and unaware of their infected contagious 
state it said 
experts generally are gravely underestimating the degree to 
which the aids virus has spread into the heterosexual community 
it said 
the authors said they based their findings on their own study of 
800 sexually active heterosexual adults between the ages of 21 and 
40 who met three criteria no blood transfusions received since 
1977 no use of illicit drugs by injection no homosexual or 
bisexual contact since 1977 
the study however did not appear to follow the usual 
scientific process and the authors conceded that their sample was 
not obtained by random sampling methods and did not closely match 
the general us population 
they said they found that among a subgroup of subjects who 
average more than 12 partners annually and generally failed to take 
precautions 14 percent of the women had been infected with the 
aids virus and 12 percent of the men 
the findings were an indication the researchers said that 
public health authorities have failed to impress the general 
public with the message that aids has broken out

materiality is something to be determined on the basis of the 
particular facts of each case blackmun said materiality 
depends on the significance the reasonable investor would place on 
the withheld or misrepresented information 
using that standard the court ordered further lower court 
hearings in the suit by investors in basic who said they lost money 
because facts were withheld from them 
blackmun said the presumption at the new hearings must be that 
the investors would have relied on those facts unless the 
management of basic can prove otherwise 
where materially misleading statements have been disseminated 
into an impersonal welldeveloped market for securities the 
reliance of individual plaintiffs on the integrity of the market 
price may be presumed blackmun said 
he was joined by justices william j brennan thurgood marshall 
and john paul stevens 
justice byron r white in an opinion joined by justice sandra 
day oconnor said the ruling may have many adverse unintended 
effects as it is applied and interpreted in the years to come 
for example white said many investors in basic who are now 
suing may have doubted the companys denials that preliminary 
merger talks were underway 
such investors the savviest of the savvy will be able to 
recover under the courts opinion white said 
the case is basic inc vs levinson 86279

people who hunt vampires live in caves or slide 
down buildings in pink elephant costumes arent crazy theyre just 
eccentric and more creative than everybody else says a researcher 
who spent three years studying them 
dr david weeks principal clinical psychologist at the royal 
edinburgh hospital in scotland interviewed 130 eccentrics and said 
he found only one insane person in the crowd 
he has turned his findings into a book called eccentrics the 
scientific investigation to be published in may by stirling 
university press 
it was the first scientific study of its kind in the world 
weeks said in a telephone interview monday his study exploded a 
few myths among them that britons are more eccentric than 
americans 
britain has more of a reputation for eccentricity said 
weeks an american from garwood nj who has lived in britain 
since 1975 
but both the united states and britain seem to have more 
eccentrics than other countries possibly because they have the 
strongest traditions of free speech according to weeks 
its also a myth that british eccentrics are mainly aristocrats 
theyre mostly in the upper middle class professional 
people the psychologist said and they tend to be outspoken 
loners 
weeks cites prince charles as an eccentric given his interest 
in unconventional medicine his habit of talking to plants his 
solitary trips to meditate and his peevish outbursts against modern 
architecture 
hed probably be a lot more eccentric if he werent royalty 
the psychologist said that probably restricts him 
weeks reckons one person in 10000 is an eccentric they tend to 
be highly creative and have vivid imaginations and graphic dreams 
they have lots of good ideas weeks said however they 
can be inflexible if they get a good idea they stick with it 
the eccentrics weeks met included a man who has lived in a cave 
for eight years 
another eccentric scales office buildings in a pink elephant 
costume and has built a helimobile a contraption with wheels 
wings flashing lights and an engine 
it moves but it doesnt fly weeks said 
then there was a teacher from long island ny who set up a 
vampire investigation bureau which is open at night the teacher 
travels the world hunting the bloodthirsty creatures 
and a scottish lady offered herself as a virgin sacrifice in a 
mock ritual atop a extinct volcano in the middle of edinburgh 
only one turned out to be insane weeks said he thought he was 
a secret agent and demonstrated a throatcutting technique on week 
research assistant kate ward with a set of keys 
weeks and ms ward found eccentrics by word of mouth and 
publicity about their work people who thought they qualified as 
eccentrics were given mental and personality tests 
eccentrics tend to be happier than most people because they 
dont take themselves too seriously weeks said they just have 
this good sense of humor he said

hundreds of students today shut down gallaudet 
university the nations only university for the deaf out of anger 
over the selection of a president who is not hearing impaired 
the school was closed early this morning after an estimated 600 
students blocked campus entrances said thomasina wilson a 
spokeswoman for the schools security force 
joining the students who were supported by faculty members and 
alumni was at least one highranking administrator dean of 
student life frank r turk who told a reporter i have never 
felt so defeated 
at issue is the selection of elisabeth a zinser now vice 
chancellor of the university of north carolina at greensboro 
gallaudet chartered by congress in 1864 as the only liberal arts 
college for the deaf has never had a deaf president 
wilson said students blocked campus entrances with their cars 
about 6 am james barnes the schools vice president for 
business closed the university a short time later 
its totally impossible for employees to get in wilson said 
the board said it would meet with the protesting students but 
only if they allowed traffic on and off the campus the students 
refused 
besides a deaf president the students were demanding the 
resignation of board chairman jane bassett spilman and a change in 
the makeup of the 20member board to increase the number of deaf 
members from four to more than half 
a city police officer capt mj johnson said he expected no 
arrests as long as the demonstration remained peaceful 
turk walking with students outside the school said the board 
was the problem 
ive been on the gallaudet payroll for 35 years said turk 
who is deaf i have never felt so defeated i do not think i will 
ever experience a more frustrating feeling in my life obviously 
we need to overhaul our board of trustees completely they must 
go now 
after zinsers selection was announced late sunday night 
students marched 60 blocks from the campus in northeast washington 
to the downtown hotel where the universitys board was meeting and 
back again 
on the way back the marchers passed the white house then sat 
at the foot of the capitol grounds where they were faced for half 
an hour by a line of 25 city police officers 
earlier sunday throngs of students faculty and alumni had 
gathered at the schools gates and waved signs urging deaf 
president now 
its important for us student sherri lambert said a deaf 
president is a role model of all deaf people he is a leader of the 
whole deaf community 
students faculty and alumni had been urging the appointment of 
one of the deaf candidates for several weeks in picking zinser 
the schools trustes bypassed two deaf candidates 
the deaf candidates for the job were harvey j corson 44 
superintendent of the louisiana school for the deaf in baton rouge 
and a gallaudet board member and i king jordan 45 dean of 
gallaudets college of arts and sciences both are gallaudet 
graduates 
the cause of a deaf president has had strong support in 
congress republican presidential candidates robert dole and george 
bush have urged the board to name the schools first deaf president 
in 124 years we didnt give them a chance residence hall 
supervisor tina jo breindel wrote on note paper like eating 
italian food in chinese restaurant strange 
zinser who has been vice chancellor at greensboro since 1983 
said she plans to take the new job despite the protests very 
soon i hope to have the opportunity to be a real person to them 
she said 
zinser said the most important step for her now is to develop 
skills to communicate with the deaf community she does not know 
sign language but is taking classes in it 
spilman said zinser had been chosen because neither of the 
other two candidates had the breadth of her experience 
the vote was 104 for zinser of the four deaf board members 
three voted against zinser one could not vote because he was a 
candidate for the job 
we are aware that it is inevitable that there will be a period 
where intense disappointment will take over spilman said we 
know that it will not be easily or quickly erased we are convinced 
that given a chance both students and the deaf community at large 
will respond 
zinser received her doctorate in educational psychology from the 
university of california berkeley in 1972 she also has a 
bachelors degree in nursing from stanford university and a 
masters degree in management from the massachusetts institute of 
technology 
the previous president jerry c lee left in january to become 
a vice president of bassett furniture co run by the board 
chairmans family 
gallaudet has an enrollment of 2200 university students 400 
high school students and 200 elementary school students nearly all 
the undergraduates are deaf 
school spokesman kelly voyet said life at gallaudet is similar 
to that at other colleges except for the ways in which people 
communicate 
students are taught in the total communication method which 
is signed english and voice said voyet so that no matter what 
method the student uses to communicate its available to him a 
lot of students in their schools learned how to lip read as well as 
sign 
the students use tty machines which have typewriters with 
screens to talk on the telephone strobe lilghts replace fire 
alarms 
otherwise its basically the same as other universities 
voyet said you just dont hear a lot of voices other than 
signing theres nothing different they live in dorms play 
sports have homecoming its a university with the normal 
university things the communication method is a little different 
in some respect but thats it

election campaigning is causing some beer 
lovers in kenya to run short of their favorite brew as politicians 
try to woo voters with free rounds an official of kenya breweries 
limited said monday 
the result according to bar and restaurant owners across the 
country is that they arent getting enough beer to satisfy 
customer demand 
many politicians vying for parliamentary seats and civic posts 
in the march 21 election have been buying beer for wouldbe 
supporters 
peter burugu transport and sales director for the 
privatelyowned kenya breweries said the company saturday released 
500000 crates of beer for distribution throughout the country 
each crate holds 24 bottles 
normally this is enough but it proved inadequate during this 
period of the year and the 1988 political campaigns he said

a twoheaded shrimp a fisherman found in 
his bait bucket appears to be the first such specimen on record 
experts say 
were dealing with a first occurrence here i guess to the 
best of our knowledge said neal baxter chief of the national 
marine fisheries service ecology division in galveston 
the shrimp has been sent to the smithsonian institution in 
washington 
howard fraley 37 and his wife cj were fishing near 
galveston last may when fraley dipped into his bait bucket and came 
out with the oddity 
i said why this things got two heads he said 
the couple photographed the shrimp then took it home and put it 
in their freezer 
mrs fraley mentioned it to baxter who told austin b williams 
a curator of invertebrates at the smithsonians national museum of 
natural history 
it was as curious to me as it was to the folks who found it 
williams said 
williams dissected the shrimp and said both heads appeared 
normal in many ways he has searched scientific literature to the 
late 1800s but has found no mention of a similar case 
fraley feels lucky to have found the creature 
i was excited he said and to think i nearly tore the 
head off

corruption is so rampant in the soviet republic of 
turkmenia that a powerful underworld has developed complete with 
hit men protection rackets police payoffs and powerful mob 
chieftains pravda said monday 
the communist party newspaper even noted that the funeral of an 
underworld crime boss drew 400 mourners 
pravda said many police officers not only looked the other way 
at crime in the central asian republic but masterminded some of 
the schemes it said 12 are now are on trial for extortion 
they extorted money mostly from those who wouldnt appeal to 
the police like a certain gavrush sarkisya a former shop foreman 
who confessed to the police later that he owed the criminals 
150000 pravda said and they threatened him with a firing 
squad should he fail to pay up 
other central asian republics also have been blasted by the 
soviet media for largescale corruption in recent months the 
media have exposed millions of dollars in graft in uzbekistan 
turkmenias neighbor to the north 
on jan 20 the weekly literaturnaya gazeta disclosed that the 
head of an agricultural complex in uzbekistan built his own mob 
empire complete with his own courts and an underground prison 
constructed by 1000 workers 
the expose was striking in its recitation of abuses 
pravdas account on turkmenia while not as dramatic was the 
strongest criticism yet of the soviet unions southernmost 
republic which has 327 million people mostly moslems 
official media criticism of turkmenia usually has centered 
around moslem customs judged by the central government to be 
abhorent such as reports of young women being killed for 
insufficient marriage dowries 
the republic suffers a difficult situation created over years 
of bureaucratic rule pravda said referring to the swelling 
bureacracy it added every sixth person in the republic is a 
hack official 
many highly placed police officials and policemen of lesser 
ranks were involved in all kinds of crimes and often acted as 
their skilled masterminds the newspaper reported 
pravda said the crackdown in the region began with the recent 
appointment of alexander f udalov as the republics police chief 
pravda said he was threatened shortly after taking office by ilyas 
a sarkiev one of those now on trial 
just leave me alone quit this case several hundred thousand 
rubles will go your way sarkiev was quoted as telling udalov 
also keep in mind i know the city your daughter lives in i have 
nothing to lose you know you wont be able to get all my people 
the newspaper said that sarkiev was arrested three days after 
making the threat 
pravda also described a threat against a allaverdov the 
manager of a footwear shop in ashkabad he reported that when he 
had a falling out with sarkiev violence began 
allaverdov told authorities his new car was stolen and found 
burned the next morning in the center of the city the windows of 
his apartment were shot out he said and he received a threat that 
his son would be kidnapped 
pravda said the recent crackdown has routed several 
criminals from official posts in turkmenia but it noted that a 
recent funeral illustrated continuing problems 
a wellknown underworld figure died in a traffic accident 
four hundred criminals came to his funeral from different cities 
which goes to show the atmosphere in ashkhabad quite well pravda 
said

the supreme court ruled unanimously today that 
financially troubled farmers may not avoid foreclosure under 
federal bankruptcy law by promising to use their labor experience 
and expertise in continuing to operate their farm 
by an 80 vote the court said a secured creditors right to 
adequate protection under bankruptcy law cannot be satisified 
by such a promise 
the ruling is a key setback for many farmers who suffered 
financial difficulty in the early 1980s one such couple was james 
and mary ahlers grain and livestock farmers who farm about 840 
acres of land in nobles county minn 
the ahlers have outstanding loans with two minnesota banks 
norwest bank worthington and the federal land bank of st paul 
todays decision overturning a ruling by the 8th us circuit 
court of appeals is a victory for the two banks 
between 1965 and 1982 the ahlers obtained four loans from the 
federal land bank of st paul securing each of the loans with a 
separate parcel of land they owned 
between 1982 and 1984 they obtained additional loans from 
norwest bank worthington securing them with a second mortgage on 
the land used to secure the federal land bank loans and a first 
mortgage on their farms machinery equipment crops and livestock 
the ahlers defaulted on the loans over 500000 to the federal 
land bank and about 450000 to norwest just after norwest went to 
court in an attempt to take control of the ahlers assets the 
couple filed for reorganization under federal bankruptcy law 
that move automatically froze norwests collection efforts in a 
state court 
the two banks claiming they were undersecured creditors sought 
the bankruptcy judges help in seizing control of the ahlers 
assets the banks said the ahlers could not protect their secured 
interest in the outstanding loans 
the bankruptcy judge and a federal trial judge cleared the way 
for foreclosure on the ahlers farm but the 8th circuit court 
reversed those rulings in 1986 
the appeals court ruled that the banks right to adequate 
protection could be satisified by the ahlers promise to continue 
to work their farm with the experience and expertise they bring to 
the job 
the banks then successfully sought supreme court review joined 
by the reagan administration in urging a reversal of the appeals 
court ruling 
writing for the court today justice byron r white said the 
appeals court ruling wrongly carved out an exception to the 
absolute priority rule of bankruptcy law 
that rule bars people who file for bankruptcy from getting 
anything out of a reorganization plan unless all creditors are paid 
off in full 
we find no support in the bankruptcy code or our previous 
decisions for the court of appeals application of the absolute 
rule in this case white said we conclude that the rule 
applies here and the ahlers promise of future labor warrants no 
exception to its operation 
justice anthony m kennedy did not participate in the decision 
the case is norwest bank worthington vs ahler 86958

guilt drove a man to turn himself in and confess 
after more than two years on the run since he bludgeoned and 
strangled his sister in a dispute over money police say 
i think the police are looking for me officials quoted 
henry zalewski as saying when he walked into a police station 
saturday evening 
zalewski 54 was charged sunday with seconddegree murder in 
the killing of his sister genevieve zalewski 62 in the apartment 
they shared on sept 30 1985 
he did it in a fit of anger and because of a financial 
situation he was in said detective joseph stabile 
zalewski also was charged with attempted murder for the beating 
of a neighbor alice turel now 50 on the same day 
detectives said that during his confession zalewski said he 
turned himself in because the guilt was driving him toward suicide 
stabile said that at the time of the slaying zalewski was 
penniless and in debt to a loanshark for 8400 
on the morning of the slaying zalewski made his sister 
breakfast while she was in the kitchen he struck her on the head 
with a piece of pipe dragged her into a bedroom and strangled her 
with rope stabile said 
while fleeing he encountered turel and beat her over the head 
with a pair of pliers before kicking her down a flight of stairs 
stabile said turel needed 67 stitches in the head 
he disappeared after the attack but police watched the apartment 
for three months because a hit list of neighbors was discovered 
inside officer hugh barry said 
zalewski said he took 40 from the house and began wandering up 
and down the east coast he got a social security number under a 
phony name and alternated between getting welfare and temporary 
work 
stabile said zalewski started drinking a quart of vodka a day to 
try to dull the memory of killing his sister 
three weeks ago he phoned st stanislaus church to find out 
where his sister was buried

mayor raymond l flynn says he may skip bostons 
st patricks day parade because he and his wife have been invited 
to dublin by irish prime minister charles haughey 
missing the parade in south boston would mean flynn would not 
face jeers similar to those he faced at a recent hearing on his 
plan to desegregate housing projects in that neighborhood 
flynn was invited to dublin to help celebrate that citys 
millenium 
police said flynns integration proposal has made him a target 
of increasing death threats 
weve gotten threats periodically since he came into office 
but theyve increased over the past few weeks said sgt 
detective edward wallace were treating it as a serious matter 
flynns wife cathy said she was preparing to go to church 
sunday when police told her someone had threatened to bomb the 
house wallace said a search failed to turn up any explosive device 
i took a position that i believe in and im going to see that 
its implemented the mayor said saturday about his housing plan 
i cant just worry about the political consequences of everything 
i do people in southie have more respect for somebody who takes a 
position rather than someone who ducks and hides behind someone 
else 
city councilor james kelly of south boston said he believed 
flynn was skipping the parade to avoid potential embarrassment 
i think the mayor feels he would not be that wellreceived 
said kelly a vocal flynn critic obviously that would not be 
good for his image after all this is his neighborhood

us officials are monitoring polish and east 
german cooperation with efforts to close down an arms trading 
office affiliated with the abu nidal terrorist group 
according to a cia report abu nidal kept an apartment in warsaw 
and his associates ran a trade operation from an office tower there 
after he was forced to leave iraq in 1983 
last summer us diplomats began pressuring the polish 
government privately and in august the poles promised to close the 
operation sasinternational commerce and investments and order 
its staff to leave the country a similar operation was closed in 
east germany 
the front offices have been shut down in poland and east 
germany a state department official said they have told us 
and we believe that they have been shut down 
this doesnt necessarily mean that these governments have 
ended all their contacts with abu nidals associates for good wed 
like to think so it is something that remains to be seen said 
the source who like others interviewed over the past week spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
polish officials insisted that the government had no idea 
what sas was 
but us officials say polish security agencies must have known 
that abu nidal had overall control over sas and that the 
organization was selling sovietbloc arms in the middle east 
there are factions in these governments and top political 
leaders and places like the foreign ministries might not have known 
what was going on one us government terrorism expert said 
abu nidal nom de guerre of palestinianborn sabri albanna is 
now believed to live in tunis according to sovietbloc and 
administration sources 
abu nidals group is blamed for numerous terrorist incidents 
including attacks in the rome and vienna airports on dec 27 1985 
in which 18 people were killed 
the head of sas samir hasan najmeddin was forced to leave 
poland on jan 14 several days after the departure of his top 
deputy according to polish officials 
the poles delayed the expulsions for nearly a month past a 
promised december deadline upsetting some us counterterrorism 
officials who pushed for release of an unclassified version of the 
cia report 
us diplomats dealing with europe meanwhile sought to keep 
the affair under wraps administration sources said 
some details of the report were published in the new york times 
however angering polish leader wojciech jaruzelski who complained 
about the leak during a january meeting in warsaw with deputy 
secretary of state john c whitehead the no 2 official in the 
department sources said whitehead expressed regret about the 
disclosure the sources said 
the cia report which was discussed by administration officials 
but not shown to the ap said najmeddin settled in warsaw in 1973 
at no 3 bagno st apt 24 and founded sas 10 years later to 
sell arms and other goods abroad mainly in the middle east sas 
maintained offices on the 25th floor of the intraco building in 
warsaw 
poland earned badly needed foreign currency from the enterprise 
and abu nidals group kept most of the profit as well as weapons 
sas was the most important link in a chain of legitimate 
business enterprises affiliated with abu nidal in europe the us 
report said 
the east germans allowed an abu nidal affiliate called zibado 
consultant and international commerce to keep an office on 
friedrichstrasse in east berlin in 198386 but now have closed it 
and bulgarian officials also have curtailed their ties with 
terrorist organizations according to a senior administration 
source 
polish government spokesman jerzy urban announced the closure of 
the sas office in january and said authorities did not know 
whether abu nidal had ever been in poland 
i am saying this cautiously because the authorities cannot 
exclude that abu nidal entered the country under another name 
urban told reporters 
according to the cia abu nidal presided over at least four 
meetings in warsaw two in december 1983 again in september 1984 
and most recently in june 1987 
in poland sas dealt with the etat cenzin co and paid its 
representative andrzej marchewska 600 a month to facilitate 
visas for palestinian operatives and obtain customs clearances for 
shipments of pistols rifles and handheld antitank and 
antiaircraft weapons 
the cia report said many of these weapons went to terrorists 
linked to abu nidal 
in the summer of 1984 the report said sas sold libya 4000 
sovietdesigned kalashnikov assault rifles made in east germany for 
about 500000 
the next year sas was agent for the sale of rifles and 
pistols in the middle east 
in 1986 the report said the company obtained 115 british 
enfield antiriot weapons keeping 15 and giving 100 to east german 
authorities 
additionally the report said sas sponsored scholarships for 
palestinians to study in poland and some of them were recruited 
into abu nidals terrorist organization

the death of a 12yearold boy whose nude 
body was found in his familys portable dishwasher has been ruled 
accidental authorities said monday 
brown county coroner genie williams has not officially ruled on 
a cause of death but cmdr david zasada said initial indications 
are that michael conard very probably died of a lack of oxygen 
prior to the hot water beginning to circulate in the machine a 
week ago 
the boy who was 4foot10 and weighed about 90 pounds 
apparently used the soap dispenser inside the door to pull the door 
shut zasada said there is no release mechanism inside the 
machine he said 
the boy took off his clothes and watch before climbing in 
machine apparently to see how it worked zasada said

a palestinian convicted of trying to plant a bomb 
on an israeli airliner lost his bid to appeal his 45year sentence 
monday after a judge declared the prison term was not a day too 
long 
nezar hindawi was jailed in october 1986 for duping his pregnant 
fiancee into carrying a bomb aboard an el al jumbo jet at londons 
heathrow airport the previous april israeli guards found the bomb 
before it reached the plane 
allegations that the jordanborn palestinian was in league with 
the syrian embassy in london led britain to sever diplomatic ties 
with damascus hindawi claimed the israelis framed him 
hindawis sentence was not a day too long for as foul and 
as horrible a crime as can possibly be imagined ruled lord chief 
justice geoffrey lane presiding over the threejudge appeals court 
hindawis attorney michael massih argued that hindawis 
actions had not caused loss of life but lane said it is no 
thanks to him that he did not succeed in destroying 36o to 37o 
lives in an effort to promote one side of a political dispute by 
terrorism 
pleading for hindawi to be permitted to appeal his sentence 
massih argued that it was harsh compared with the 35year sentence 
imposed on patrick magee convicted of planting an irish republican 
army bomb in a hotel where prime minister margaret thatcher was 
staying that bomb killed five people 
lane pointed out that unlike magee hindawi could get onethird 
off for good conduct and serve only 30 years 
hindawi 33 was not in court

arizonas top police officer testified 
today at gov evan mechams impeachment trial that he was 
surprised and shocked when the governor told him not to 
cooperate in an investigation of an alleged death threat 
department of public safety director ralph milstead told the 
senate today that mecham told him last nov 15 the alleged threat 
was a family spat 
impeachment charges against the 63yearold mecham firstterm 
republican included a charge that he tried to thwart an 
investigation of the alleged threat 
milstead quoted mecham as saying the attorney general is out 
to hang me and im not going to help him in any way dont tell 
the attorney general anything 
he said never dont give them any help milstead said 
this whole situation surprised and shocked me i just cannot 
cover up even if the governor is the one telling me to do that 
the senate decided earlier this morning not to grant immunity to 
the man accused of making the threat former state official lee 
watkins 
attorney general bob corbin told lawmakers that granting 
immunity to watkins former head of state prison construction 
could wind up protecting him from prosecution for alleged crimes 
you have no way of knowing about today 
senators were considering whether to grant use immunity to 
watkins to force him to say whether he threatened the life of donna 
carlson last november which would have meant his testimony could 
not be used against him in criminal court 
on friday watkins invoked the fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination in refusing to testify before the senate 
watkins said today that if the state grand jury probe were over he 
would have no problem with testifying 
these are the people the attorney generals office that are 
out to get the governor watkins said anybody that gets in the 
middle is going to get hurt 
shortly after the senates voice vote watkins admitted he 
hadnt expected to get immunity 
a grant of immunity should be made only if the testimony sought 
is central to the case if lawmakers think watkins will tell the 
truth and if the immunity will not compromise a criminal 
investigation corbin said 
a state grand jury investigation of watkins is continuing 
corbin said 
mechams defense lawyer jerris leonard accused prosecutors of 
trying to harm watkins reputation in testimony last week and of 
splattering the mud broadly enough so that it splatters on the 
respondent mecham 
department of public safety director ralph milstead also was 
scheduled to take the stand today mecham is accused of ordering 
milstead not to cooperate with corbins investigation of the 
alleged threat 
mecham was impeached nov 5 by the house which also accused him 
of concealing a 350000 campaign loan and misusing 80000 from 
the governors protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership 
watkins has been investigated by the state grand jury in 
connection with the alleged threat but has not been charged 
attorneys said last week the inquiry was continuing 
last friday peggy griffith head of the governors office of 
womens services testified that watkins told her nov 12 that ms 
carlson a former special gubernatorial assistant who was about to 
testify before the grand jury on the 350000 loan was a bad 
girl she told the trial that if ms carlson kept talking she 
is going to take a long boat ride 
watkins has denied making a threat and prosecutor william 
french asked him friday if he had taken six liedectector tests in 
an effort to prove he hadnt made the threat watkins refused to 
answer the question 
mrs griffith also testified that when she described the alleged 
threat to max hawkins then watkins boss he shrugged it off as 
just a bunch of hot air 
mecham in testimony before a house impeachment committee in 
january acknowledged that he may have told milstead not to 
cooperate with the attorney generals probe however mecham also 
contended he was not fully informed about the seriousness of the 
situation before his conversation with milstead 
mecham the first us governor to face an impeachment trial in 
six decades did not attend the first five days of testimony last 
week 
a twothirds vote of the 30member senate is required to convict 
mecham and remove him from office mecham also faces a may 17 
recall election and a march 22 criminal trial in connection with 
the 350000 campaign loan

the supreme court today agreed to study the 
appeal of a convicted chicago murderer sentenced to 50 to 100 years 
in prison for his crime 
the justices said they will use warren lee harris case to give 
federal courts some further guidance in how to handle the appeals 
of defendants convicted in state courts 
harris was convicted of the july 19 1977 murder in chicago of 
earnest howard 
after his conviction was upheld by the illinois courts on direct 
appeal harris filed a socalled habeas corpus appeal in state 
courts in it he contended for the first time that he was denied 
adequate legal help at his trial 
state courts ruled that harris could not raise that issue 
because he had failed to raise it on direct appeal but it then 
rejected the merits of harris ineffectiveassistance argument 
harris then sought help from the federal courts in a habeas 
corpus petition raising the same issue 
a federal trial judge ruled that harris procedural default 
which usually would preclude federal court review of his claim had 
been waived by the state courts 
but the 7th us circuit court of appeals last june 12 ruled 
that the procedural default blocks federal court review of the 
ineffectiveassistance argument 
the case is harris vs reed 875677

six us navy ships assembled in the 
southern persian gulf on monday prompting rumors of retaliation 
for an iranian attack on american helicopters but the navy called 
the ship movements routine 
iran said monday its antiaircraft batteries fired on two 
helicopters over the weekend forcing them to withdraw because the 
choppers ignored a warning to stay clear of an iranian zone in 
the gulf the united states issued a similar account earlier 
rumors of navy action spread through shipping circles in the 
gulf where iran and iraq have been at war since september 1980 
when six us vessels were spotted off dubai they included a 
chartered tanker and combat stores ship 
the navy denied the rumors we wouldnt be planning an attack 
with a supply ship lt cmdr mark van dyke said these 
movements were scheduled long before the helicopter incident 
tehrans official islamic republic news agency said the 
helicopters were forced to flee by antiaircraft fire at about 
midnight saturday 
us officials had said american helicopters took evasive 
action after machine guns were fired from an oil platform and 
several small boats during a scouting mission ahead of the us 
missile frigate simpson they did not say how many choppers were 
involved 
neither report gave the location of the oil platform or named 
it but the american versian said it was not the rostam platform 
which four us destroyers shelled oct 19 
rostam has been reported under repair since the raid described 
by us officials as a measured response to an attack in which 
an iranian silkworm missile damaged a usflagged kuwaiti tanker 
anchored at kuwaits main oil terminal 
at the time the us officials said more severe reprisals could 
be expected if iran attacked other american ships or aircraft 
since last july us warships have protected kuwaiti tankers 
sailing under the american flag eleven of the sheikdoms tankers 
have been given us registration 
the rostam precedent combined with the sighting of the six ships 
to encourage the rumors of us plans for retaliation 
navy officers said two of the ships the guided missile frigates 
copeland and gary were learning the ropes as new members of the 
gulfbased fleet the middle east force 
they were escorting the 18000ton stores ship san jose and the 
39000ton oiler lh gianella both on resupply missions van dyke 
said 
he said it was just coincidental that the four ships were 
spotted near the missile cruiser wainwright and missile frigate 
john a moore which have been in the gulf for weeks and were on 
routine escort duty off dubai 
in the navys gulf operation which has been cut from 17 to 16 
ships the copeland and gary are expected to replace sister 
frigates mcclusky and reuben james the next vessels slated to 
depart under navy policy that limits duty tours to six months 
porttoport 
irans account of the helicopter incident said two us 
helicopters attempting to approach an iranian zone in the persian 
gulf early sunday were forced to flee by the antiaircraft fire of 
naval forces of the islamic republic of iran 
the navy antiaircraft detected the two helicopters on its 
radar and warned them to stay out of the iranian zone however the 
iranian navy fired warning shots after the us helicopters 
violated the iranian zone 
nothing was said in the us version about a warning before the 
shooting started 
it was the second time in a month that iran claimed to have 
driven off american helicopters with antiaircraft fire us 
officials denied the first iranian report of a similar incident 
feb 12 at sirri island in the south central gulf 
iran uses some oil platforms and small islands in the gulf as 
bases for armed speedboats that attack commercial shipping 
there have been no such attacks since feb 11 and no iraqi air 
raids on irans own oil shipping since feb 12 one of the longest 
lulls in the tanker war since it began in february 1984 
iran and iraq have been attacking each others capitals and 
other cities since feb 29 in a new round of the war of the 
cities that has cost thousands of lives during the 7yearold 
war

the reagan administration said today it has 
protested poor maintenance of some panama canal facilities but 
said the problem was not linked to the recent political turmoil 
there 
there are some facilities that are maintained by panama that 
we have protested in a sense of not being adequately maintained 
said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
he said the complaint was registered sometime previously and 
was not intended to justify an abrogation of the panama canal 
treaty 
meanwhile a newspaper reported that political appointees 
installed by the panamanian government are mismanaging operations 
of the canal that have been turned over by the united states 
any user of those facilities will tell you there are 
difficulties now that simply did not exist 10 years ago an 
unidentified panamanian economist told the new york times 
among the facilities suffering from mismanagement are ports 
marine bunkering installations a railroad a bridge and air 
traffic control according to the times which interviewed canal 
employees and shipping experts 
this government has put a political aspect to an equation that 
has no room for politics said a panamanian engineer who has 
worked at the canal for more than a decade as soon as you start 
to mix panamanian politics with the running of the canal that is 
the end of things 
the countrys political situation has been particularly troubled 
in recent weeks gen manuel antonio noriega the military leader 
who is panamas de facto leader engineered the ouster of president 
eric arturo delvalle after delvalle tried to fire him 
the united states still recognizes delvalle who is in hiding 
as panamas rightful president and has brought economic pressure to 
bear to oust noriega noriega is also under indictment in the 
united states for alleged drug trafficking 
panama is scheduled to take control of the waterway in the year 
2000 according to the 1977 treaties but some of the 7000 canal 
employees 83 percent of whom are panamanians fear that domestic 
political interference could hinder their ability to run the canal 
professionally the times said 
as the year 2000 approaches it is going to be necessary for 
laws to keep this organization a bit apart from the normal 
government structure so there is no interference by other 
ministries or the implantation of political but unskilled people in 
the upper echelons said dennis p mcauliffe an american and 
chief administrator of the canal 
a panamanian civil engineer told the newspaper that derailments 
on the railroad have increased because of lack of maintenance and 
that rail yards are in a state of disrepair 
shipping lines complain that lights and gangways dont work and 
that fenders along docks are not maintained 
the panama defense forces have taken some of the best office 
buildings for their own use as warehouses or as prisons the times 
reported forcing some canal operations to move elsewhere

president reagan lashed out today at 
congressional opponents to contra aid accusing them of a lack of 
courage in the battle against communism in central america 
in a speech to the veterans of foreign wars convention reagan 
talked about the votes last week in congress that left the rebels 
battling the leftist government of nicragua without us funding 
the 216208 vote defeated a democratic plan to provide 308 
million in food clothing and medical aid to the rebels the vote 
was scheduled by the democratic leadership so the house could not 
vote on an aid plan favored by the republicans 
courage hasnt exactly been the watchword of some opponents of 
contra aid reagan said last week aid opponents tried to 
pass the buck of responsibility for abandoning in the field the 
young men and women of the democratic resistance and that ploy 
failed as it should have 
administration officials have expressed the hope congress could 
come up with an alternative plan to keep the rebels alive as a 
fighting force 
after reagans speech white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
acknowledged that a real problem exists for the administration 
because a new contra aid package might not be considered for some 
time 
its just a matter of time he said we will produce a 
package he vowed at another point 
in his speech reagan recalled that nicaraguan president daniel 
ortega dismissed cardinal obando y bravo as the mediator in peace 
talks with the rebels 
you know where ortega stands isnt it time for congress to 
have the courage to show where it stands reagan asked 
rhetorically 
now its time for congress to show that it knows you cant 
have real peace negotiations when one side has helicopter gunships 
and the other has bandages he said 
reagan said the defeat of the contras would mean a grave 
strategic defeat for the united states 
the communists in central america understand this the soviets 
understand this its time that congress understood it too 
reagan said adding a soviet base on the american mainland is a 
pistol pointed at the heart of the americas 
reagan contended that the real issue before the congress is 
not the contras it is communisim in central america 
the president who was warmly greeted by the audience of older 
veterans told them of his recent trip to brussels belgium where 
he met with nato leaders he asked their support for the 
ratification of the recently signed ussoviet treaty banning 
mediumrange nuclear missles from europe 
reagan also called on congress to reject further cuts in the 
nations defense budget and allow for a strong alliance defense 
this is not the time to drop our guard reagan said its 
just this simple if we put americans in harms way we owe them 
the best weapons money can buy 
well need to keep up our strength if were to succeed and 
thats why the congress must not further reduce the defense 
budget reagan said 
offering a report on the brussels meeting in his saturday radio 
address reagan declared that arms reduction is not enough in 
dealing with the soviets and demanded they abandon the offensive 
strategy displayed against the western alliance on the european 
continent 
reagan said there was a lesson learned at the meeting which 
was the first fullscale summit for the leaders of the north 
atlantic treaty organization in six years 
one must always negotiate with the soviets from a position of 
strength reagan said 
following the nato summit a white house advance team traveled 
to moscow to scout out possible sites for the fourth meeting 
between reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev planned for 
late may or early june 
in his radio speech reagan pointed out that while the allies 
praised the new ussoviet agreement to remove all mediumrange 
nuclear missiles from europe they reaffirmed the need to remain 
united and keep their guard up 
thats why continued modernization of nato forces nuclear 
and conventional is essential reagan said

the us government is seeking the dismissal 
of a lawsuit that would end federal aid to religious schools 
abroad primarily jewish schools in israel a prosecutor said 
monday 
bernard bell an assistant us attorney in new yorks southern 
district said he filed papers in federal court friday arguing that 
the case ought to be dropped because the american civil liberties 
union does not have standing a legal term which means the 
right to bring the lawsuit 
but c edwin baker a staff attorney the aclu in new york said 
the civil liberties group maintains that it can pursue the lawsuit 
because the aclu represents american taxpayers whose money is used 
for the schools the aclu has until march 24 to respond 
the lawsuit stemmed from reports last december that sen daniel 
k inouye dhawaii had persuaded his colleagues to allocate 8 
million to build schools in france for north african jews 
the program provoked a firestorm of criticism prompting inouye 
to ask congress to rescind the money lawmakers agreed to inouyes 
wish 
after president reagan signed the bill killing the 8 million 
program last month the aclu amended its complaint to cover jewish 
and catholic schools that receive money under the american schools 
and hospitals abroad program which is administered by the agency 
for international development 
baker said lawyers learned about the program in the course of 
their research into the inouyesupported item 
the lawsuit filed in us district court in new york claims 
that providing money to pervasively sectarian schools or for 
construction of sectarian schools is a violation of the 
constitutions first amendment calling for separation of church and 
state the aclu asks the court to block further spending on the 
schools 
under the schools and hospitals program a favorite in congress 
grants are awarded to a nonprofit american organization that 
sponsors an institution overseas the program is designed to 
promote american educational methods abroad and train foreigners in 
medicine and promote american educational values 
aid which has regulations governing the program awards the 
grants on a competitive basis congress is notified before the 
money is spent 
the budget figures indicate how fond congress is of the program 
in fiscal year 1988 aid asked for 10 million congress increased 
the budget to 40 million the previous fiscal year the program 
received 35 million 
the aclu is not challenging grants given to hospitals or 
nonsectarian schools abroad baker said but the group wants to 
end support for schools that have as a stated goal the teaching of 
principles and doctrines of roman catholicism and orthodox judaism 
aid documents for the four years ending in 1986 show that 
institutions in lebanon were given the most money a total of 248 
million the lions share 24 million went to the american 
university of beirut 
institutions in israel snagged the second largest amount of 
money a total of 202 million project hope which operates 
schools worldwide received 143 million 
all of the religious schools named in the lawsuit are in israel 
among the institutions which teach judaism and have received 
money since fiscal 1983 are the american college of belz 
jerusalem 500000 beth rivka comprehensive school kfar chabad 
750000 beth yaacov avat ashdod 100000 boys town jerusalem 
12 million emunah women of america community college jerusalem

high school kiryat gat 400000 ohr somayach school jerusalem 
2 million shaalvim teachers college dn agalon 400000 
the lawsuit does not name any catholic schools for which it 
wants to eliminate money

lines snaked in front of twentieth century fox studios 
the writers guild of america rejected a final offer presented 
sunday by the alliance of motion picture and television producers 
and called a walkout for 9000 of its 9600 members the 600 wga 
news writers are exempt from this action 
the strike began here and in new york city at 9 am pst today 
the contract expired at midnight feb 29 
marty waldman a wga spokesman in new york said there would be 
no picketing in the east today 
the longer the strike goes on the more reruns the public will 
see said brian walton wga west executive director and chief 
negotiator its a very tight ratings race and unfortunately for 
the networks it will impact them 
picket captain stanley ralph ross said selection of foxs west 
los angeles studio was fairly arbitrary adding its size and 
location had a lot to do with it 
we usually pick a major studio and theres parking around 
here ross said 
grandview usa writer ken hixon who marched with his 
2year old son sam said writers were much more unified for this 
strike than in their last walkout in 1985 
there was nearly a civil war last time between screen writers 
and television writers but this time theres real solidarity 
hixon said 
viewers will begin seeing the effects on those programs 
relying on scripts on a daily basis talk shows game shows and the 
soaps will see a difference right away said guild spokeswoman 
cheryl rhoden 
the strike slows down the production process and if prolonged 
it finally comes to a halt she said a threemonth strike 
delayed the fall television season three years ago 
walton said the network that would be hardest hit would be 
firstplace nbc whose the tonight show starring johnny carson 
saturday night live and late night with david letterman 
would be affected immediately 
edward adler president of wga east said nine soap operas on 
the east coast and five in california also would be affected 
immediately as would prime time miniseries television movies and 
features in development or in production 
but herb steinberg a spokesman for the alliance which 
represents 200 producers and studios said a strike was anticipated 
and scripts have been stockpiled 
shows like carsons show will go into reruns but we will 
continue business he said 
producers had sought to scale back residual payments for some 
onehour shows syndicated in the united states and said they 
couldnt pay writers more for reruns in foreign markets 
the median annual income for writers is 40000 a year but 
about half of the guilds members are unemployed at any given time 
said rhoden the writers sought the first change in 17 years in how 
they are compensated when programs are aired in foreign markets 
they now receive a single lump sum that varies depending on what is 
negotiated between the writer and producer 
the writers also demanded more artistic control on the final 
product 
we had all kinds of creative guarantees in there short of 
giving them total control steinberg said the director is the 
captain of that creative team we couldnt bargain away rights that 
belonged to other guilds and unions 
the producers had offered a 50 million package over a 
threeyear period including improvements in pension and health 
plans steinberg said 
in union ballots last week in los angeles and new york 96 
percent approved a walkout if no agreement was reached 
the last script writers strike was in 1985 and lasted two weeks 
since the wga won its first contract in 1947 script writers 
conducted strikes five times more than any other entertainment 
industry union 
separately the screen actors guild and american federation of 
television and radio artists bargained through the weekend with 
makers of tv and radio commercials over daily pay rates and rerun 
payments for 100000 actors 
members of those unions approved a strike by a 93 percent margin 
in recent votes said sag spokesman mark locher

president reagans spokesman said today the 
administration welcomes the support and advice of 30 senators 
who argued in a letter to secretary of state george shultz that 
israel should be willing to give up control of occupied land in 
return for middle east peace 
we are in the midst of an ongoing processs the views of these 
senators are helpful to us and probably instructive to other 
parties in the region marlin fitzwater told reporters 
the 23 democrats and seven republicans including several strong 
supporters of the jewish state also expressed support for shultzs 
plan to bring israel jordan syria and palestinian arabs to a 
peace conference by may 1 in an effort to stop violence in 
israelioccupied territory that has claimed some 80 arab lives in 
three months 
the senators noted that israel has in the past supported the 
idea of land for peace by returning the sinai peninsula to 
egypt but they cited a statement by israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir that this expression of territory for peace is not 
accepted by me 
we hope that the prime ministers statement did not indicate 
that israel is abandoning a policy that offers the best hope for 
longterm peace the letter said 
the administration welcomes the support and advice from this 
group they are senators of considerable stature and interest and 
involvment in middle east affairs the spokesman said 
at the state department spokesman charles e redman said shultz 
would respond to the letter he declined to address the matter 
further except to say that the administration prefers to 
maintain a certain discreet distance in the mideast peace process 
but redman in a comment that seemed to be directed at shamir 
said the state department hopes for an early response from 
mideast governments to the us plan to set up negotiations on 
palestinian selfrule by may 1 
we believe all the parties understand and appreciate the 
reason that weve asked for these kind of responses redman told 
reporters 
shamir on sunday blocked a decision by the israeli cabinet he 
said he would permit a vote on the american initiative after he 
returns from talks here next week with reagan and shultz 
israeli foreign minister shimon peres had demanded a cabinet 
decision before shamir went to washington 
at the white house fitzwater said shultz was to brief reagan 
later today on his middle east trips and he noted that shamir is to 
visit with the president on march 16 
at the moment we proceed on a pace thats fairly well 
structured and has been laid out by secretary shultz and his 
shuttle diplomacy of the last several days fitzwater said 
the spokesman said the administration was involved in a process 
that involves a blend of some new ideas and new beliefs but he 
refused to comment further saying in the middle east its more 
important not to say anything that prohibits the process or acts as 
a stoppage than to say anything that might stimulate activity 
shultz upon returning saturday from the middle east expressed 
no criticism of shamirs position saying the prime minister and 
israeli foreign minister shimon peres agreed that israels 
annexation of territory could be a topic for negotiations peres 
and his labor party have openly endorsed shultzs proposals while 
shamir and his likud party have not

the reagan administration expressed deep 
concern today about violence in tibet as chinese foreign minister 
wu xueqian opened talks with secretary of state george p shultz 
we remain deeply concerned about the state of human rights in 
tibet and the recurring incidents of violence said charles e 
redman the state department spokesman we urge all concerned to 
exercise restraint in order to avoid further bloodshed 
at the same time redman said tibet is considered an integral 
part of china nothing has changed on that he said 
redman said he expected shultz would take up the situation with 
wu during their talks 
the state department and congress have accused china of harsh 
measures in putting down unrest in tibet 
reports that reached beijing on sunday said thousands of rioting 
tibetans had set bonfires in lhasas streets and several people 
were killed during more than 12 hours of clashes with police the 
protesters were demanding tibets independence from china 
police fired bullets and tear gas at protesters saturday and 
three to nine people were killed according to the unconfirmed 
reports from western sources in lhasa 
the administration meanwhile is dangling hightechnology sales 
as an inducement for china to give firm assurances it will halt 
delivery of silkworm missiles to iran 
the tradeoff and at least chinese neutrality in a us drive 
to impose an international arms embargo against iran looms as the 
potential highlight of the talks wu opened today 
it is his first visit in four years and the agenda is 
substantial for instance shultz will solicit chinas support for 
his proposal for arabisraeli peace talks 
shultz is trying to structure a peace conference in which the 
united states the soviet union china britain and france would 
serve as sponsors but without the power to impose terms of a 
settlement 
that calls for some delicate diplomacy shultz is walking a 
tightrope between jordan and israel on the subject 
king hussein refuses to negotiate unless he has big power 
support but israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir refuses to allow 
china or the soviets who usually support arab positions to take 
an active role 
wu arrived sunday had dinner with shultz and sees him and 
defense secretary frank c carlucci separately today on tuesday 
the chinese foreign minister calls on president reagan at the white 
house and meets with shultz again 
the shipping war in the persian gulf is uppermost in us minds 
china may be irans largest arms supplier sales last year were 
worth an estimated 1 billion 
the most dangerous of the weapons are silkworm missiles 
shortrange rockets that even in unskilled hands can wreak havoc on 
merchant ships iran has used them effectively 
despite us appeals china persisted in delivering installments 
of the silkworms to iran last year and denied what carlucci and 
other us officials said it was doing 
frustrated the united states retaliated in october by 
suspending a decadeold process of liberalizing the types of high 
technology american companies could sell to china 
since then china has said it has stopped selling silkworms to 
iran a us official speaking friday on condition of anonymity 
said our information is that theyve been living up to that 
still before resuming liberalization of the hightechnology 
trade we want to be sure were in sync with the chinese on what 
were talking about the official said we want to be sure that 
this responsiveness will continue 
on an arms embargo meanwhile shultz would like a commitment 
from wu that china would not veto a resolution in the un security 
council to impose a worldwide arms embargo against iran 
the sanctions would enforce a ceasefire resolution adopted last 
july that iraq accepted but iran scorned 
state department experts believe china would at least remain 
neutral if the soviet union agreed not to veto the resolution the 
united states has been after moscow since july for support but is 
not sure it has it yet

the reagan administration is considering 
economic and trade sanctions against panama including withholding 
monthly payments for the panama canal but has not made any 
decisions yet a white house spokesman said today 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said meetings will be held later this 
week to discuss options on how the united states can apply pressure 
to force the ouster of panamas military strongman manuel antonio 
noriega 
on march 15 the united states is due to pay 65 million to the 
panama canal commission a monthly payment toward the 75 million 
to 80 million the united states makes each year under the panama 
canal treaty 
one of the options under consideration fitzwater said is to 
put the money into an escrow account instead of paying it to panama 
earlier in the day sen alfonse damato rny said the 
united states was right to put economic pressure on noriegas 
government which damato predicted would fall within 10 days 
we are grinding him down to a halt and we should damato 
said on nbctvs today show 
i think we could have moved much faster added damato who 
is sponsoring a senate resolution calling for a total trade embargo 
against panama 
we begin to see the incredible effects that we do have 
economically the new york republican said 
panamas 12 local banks have been closed since tuesday branches 
of international institutions closed their doors friday 
the administration last week backed legal efforts to freeze 
panamanian government deposits in us banks and authorities in 
panama were prevented from drawing on those accounts to keep the 
nation supplied with us dollars the official currency of panama 
calling the panamanian strongman a terrorist and petty 
tyrant damato asked 
if we cant take noriega on with the power that we have in the 
area economically militarily how are we going to deal with 
the drug lords of mexico and colombia and bolivia and when are we 
really going to take on that war 
this is an opportunity and time for us to strike a blow for 
democracy and to go after one of the drug lords in this 
hemisphere he said 
questioned as to when he thinks noriega will be forced from 
power damato replied i would say within 10 days 
appearing with damato juan b sosa the ambassador of panamas 
deposed president eric arturo delvalle agreed with that 
prediction

palestinians on monday and the army said arab rioters hurled a 
grenade for the first time since violence began in the occupied 
territories three months ago 
defense minister yitzhak rabin defended the behavior of soldiers 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip he told parliament it was 
the first time in israels 40year history in which facetoface 
close they see the hate of the rioters 
strikes and job boycotts extended to the administration of the 
territories palestinian employees of the gaza tax department were 
summoned to military headquarters monday after 38 of the 40 workers 
said they were resigning 
inside israel palestinian guerrillas captured a commuter bus 
near beersheba and soldiers stormed the vehicle three israelis and 
three guerrillas were killed

wounded seven palestinians at idna after attackers threw a grenade 
at troopers who raided the west bank village to arrest rioters 
and inciters of rioting the arabrun palestine press service put 
the number of wounded at eight 
it was the first use of a grenade since arab riots began dec 8 
the first army report of arab gunfire in a demonstration 
occurred sunday in the askar refugee camp near nablus no soldiers 
were injured 
israeli surveillance and restrictions make it difficult for 
arabs to get firearms and the palestine liberation organization 
has ordered protesters to avoid using guns 
international sympathy has been created by images of wellarmed 
soldiers shooting and beating youths armed only with rocks and 
homemade gasoline bombs in what arabs call the uprising 
according to un figures 83 palestinians have been killed 
at alittihad hospital in nablus dr hamdallah kazlak said two 
palestinians were treated for gunshot wounds suffered in clashes 
with troops at the nearby balata refugee camp

people were treated for beatings and injuries caused by tear gas 
and rubber bullets most suffered at shati 
military authorities summoned employees of the gaza tax 
department to discuss a sunday letter signed by 38 of the 40 
workers saying they were resigning in response to a call by 
underground palestinian leaders

difficulties workers would face if they quit and the general 
situation in terms of public services that will be damaged he

territories have been threatened by palestinian nationalists and 
islamic militants

the united states has been embarassed in space 
research since the challenger disaster and risks forfeiting its 
edge in high technology and other fields unless it expands 
spacebased scientific missions a nasa official and researchers 
told a congressional hearing monday 
further delays in projects already backed up three years plus a 
lack of funding for new space experiments will allow the soviet 
union japan and european nations to cement the lead they have 
taken over the united states since the challenger explosion said 
lennard a fisk associate administrator of the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
a lead that we had was allowed to erode and now we have to ask 
ourselves where we are going said fisk who outlined the 
sciencerelated portion of nasas proposed fiscal 1989 budget to 
the senate subcommittee on science technology and space 
fisk said 20 major sciencerelated payloads are scheduled to be 
carried into space in the next four years half of them aboard 
space shuttles and half on expendable rockets 
the projects include probes to venus and jupiter and the 
launching of an xray telescope space telescope and gamma ray 
observatory designed to work in tandem to study a number of 
phenomena including a supernova that occurred last year 
the new xray telescope the advanced xray astrophysics 
facility should also help researchers determine what the universe 
looked like up to 20 billion years ago and produce dramatic 
improvements in pharmaceuticals and computer chips said dr harvey 
tananbaum of the harvardsmithsonian center for astrophysics 
resumption of the shuttle program and approval of nasas 
sciencerelated budget is vital to getting the 20 projects launched 
by 1993 and to prove to commercial businesses which pay to have 
satellites and experiments carried into space that the unites 
states will reestablish itself as a dominant force in space fisk 
said 
he also urged researchers to develop new spacebased experiments 
and technology so that nasa can begin planning missions past 1993 
when it is scheduled to complete current projects 
we have a hiatus in space science launches today because of 
the challenger tragedy fisk said let us not create another 
hiatus in the mid1990s by failing to start major flight projects 
now 
sen john kerry dmass a subcommittee member who presided 
over the hearing said a revitalized space program also was vital 
to massachusetts businesses and universities which received 846 
contracts totaling 413 million in 1987 and have to date in 1988 
been awarded 710 contracts totaling 388 million 
fisk and the academicians told the subcommittee that nasa should 
not be pressured to curtail manned missions with civilian 
researchers because of the january 1986 challenger explosion that 
killed seven astronauts including new hampshire teacher christa 
mcauliffe 
david l akin associate director of the massachusetts institute 
of technology space systems laboratory said that while computers 
and robots can greatly contribute to space research their 
advancement should not be used to support calls for an end to 
manned space flights 
exploration is one of the last jobs which should be turned 
over to robots as the curiosity for thirst and knowledge 
underlying the urge to explore is one of the finest attributes of 
being human akin said let us instead spend our efforts 
getting humans out of mine shafts and off high steel construction 
sites robots should totally replace man in the worst of jobs not 
the best

the dalai lama godking of tibetans 
held a prayer service monday in northern india to mourn weekend 
violence in lhasa capital of tibet 
in new delhi hundreds of tibetan refugees chanted we shall 
overcome in a demonstration solidarity with people in tibet 
police prevented the crowd from marching on the chinese embassy 
a statement from the dalai lamas new delhi office said the 
trouble in lhasa is yet another indication of the depth of 
tibetan peoples resentment and opposition to chinese rule 
hundreds of tibetans attended the service in dharmsala the 
dalai lamas exile headquarters in northern himachal pradesh state 
the statement said it declared that the tibetan issue cannot be 
solved by use of force and called on china to seriously 
negotiate for a solution 
in a statement from dharmsala the dalai lama urged the chinese 
to work toward a settlement which will benefit both the tibetan 
and the chinese peoples he asked that tibetans in the meantime 
refrain from violence in spite of repressive measures that the 
chinese may take 
official reports in china said one policeman was killed and 28 
were injured in the lhasa clash saturday unconfirmed reports from 
western sources put the toll at three to nine dead including a 
buddhist monk and two chinese policemen 
the dalai lama fled to india with about 100000 of his followers 
in 1959 after an abortive tibetan uprising china which claims 
tibet has been an integral part of it for centuries moved troops 
into the remote mountain region in 1950 
saturdays violence was the first in lhasa since oct 1 when 
2000 tibetans led by buddhist monks set fire to a police station 
facing the jokhang temple police opened fire and at least 14 
people were reported killed 
many tibetans resent the government in beijing because of 
oppression of tibetan religion and customs and destruction of 
temples during the 196676 radical cultural revolution 
although china has tried to redress past wrongs friction 
remains between tibetans and chinese who continue to hold many 
senior posts in lhasa 
the tibetan government has refused nearly all requests by 
foreign journalists to visit lhasa and has restricted tourism since 
the disturbances last october

a prisoner handcuffed to a hospital bed broke 
the bed rail monday and overpowered his police guard then took the 
officers gun and held two people hostage before giving up about 
six hours later 
the prisoner freed the hostages both hospital engineers but 
continued to hold police off while threatening to shoot himself or 
fire into potentially explosive tanks of acetylene and oxygen in a 
subbasement of north general hospital in harlem 
he was rational but very upset said detective frank 
gallagher the chief negotiator he had fits of depression and at 
one point put the gun to his head and at another point to his 
mouth 
the prisoner identified as yusuf harris 27 freed himself 
around 425 am in his seventhfloor room at the hospital where 
he had been taken for treatment of exposure after being arrested on 
kidnap charges early saturday officials said 
authorities were investigating how he broke his bed rail without 
alerting the guard officer timothy austin in a hallway outside 
said chief of patrol john p mccabe said 
after getting austins gun the barefoot harris wearing only a 
hospital gown and dragging a wedgeshaped section of aluminumpipe 
bed rail from his wrist made his way to the second floor where he 
got the drop on a security guard according to patients who saw the 
incident 
harris allegedly took the guards wallet with 7 then forced 
him to break open a window leading onto a setback 
around this time harris fired austins 38caliber service 
revolver chief robert johnston said but it was not known whether 
the discharge was accidental or harris had tried to hit someone no 
one was shot 
harris made his way to the subbasement where he burned his 
buttocks while clambering over a boiler said johnston 
he took his hostages ray cadmus 50 of nesconset and kemail 
bajramoski 35 of manhattan at the engineers office said 
police one of the captives freed harris from the bed rail by 
chiseling the handcuff chain 
cadmus was freed at 720 am after police sent in some coffee 
and doughnuts said johnston bajramoski was let go about an hour 
later when gallagher agreed to stay with harris in place of the 
hostage 
he said he wanted to blow himself up but he didnt want to go 
alone said gallagher 
later the officer saw the prisoner turn the gun on himself 
he said to me you want to see me do it ill do it right 
now gallagher related 
gallagher quoted harris as saying he had tried to escape because 
he feared going back into the criminal justice system 
the prisoner was calmed by talking on the telephone to his 
father and sister and to an assistant district attorney steven 
nuzzi who were brought to the hospital 
finally he threw the gun out and walked out and took my 
hand said gallagher 
still barefoot but with a red plaid shirt and a sheet over his 
gown harris was brought out at 1045 am 
mccabe said he would be charged with robbery reckless 
endangerment and weapon possession 
austin 28 who was treated for cuts and bruises had arrested 
harris originally early saturday after harris allegedly used a 
starters pistol to force a cabbie to drive him from the bronx to 
manhattan 
harris fled the cab and jumped into the east river when the 
driver got the attention of police in eastern harlem authorities 
said harbor police fished him out and austin arrested him on 
charges of kidnap menacing and gun and marijuana possession 
police said 
he had been taken to the hospital for treatment and observation

a palestinian convicted in a terrorist attack on 
an israeli jetliner lost out monday in his bid to block the 
canadian governments attempt to deport him 
federal court justice james jerome dismissed an application from 
mahmoud mohammad issas lawyers who argued that the scheduled 
march 15 deportation hearing would violate canadas charter of 
rights and freedoms 
the attorneys said that mohammad 45 will not get a fair 
hearing because immigration minister benoit bouchard has already 
told parliament that the government will not rest before he 
mohammad is out of the country 
the judge said bouchards comments could have been more 
temperate but he said the process also involves a sense of 
fairness to canada and is necessary to assess who should come 
in and who should not 
lorne waldman one of mohammads lawyers said he was filing an 
immediate appeal of the decision and a request for a stay in 
deportation proceedings until the appeal is heard 
in 1970 a greek court convicted mohammad of manslaughter for 
his part in a 1968 attack on an el al airliner at athens airport 
that left one israeli passenger dead he served three months of his 
17year sentence and was released in a hostage exchange 
he came to canada with his wife and three children a year ago 
and established a comfortable suburban life in brantford ontario 
when reporters discovered his presence in the country in 
january mohammad acknowledged having lied about his criminal 
record to gain entry to canada but he said he renounced terrorism 
and avowed to live here peacefully 
some leftwing groups and newspaper columnists have been 
sympathetic to his case 
however his claim to have renounced palestinian terrorism long 
ago has been challenged by the israeli airline pilots association 
which claims mohammad was involved in a 1986 plot to attack a 
jewish settlement in morocco 
in addition the montreal newspaper le devoir has reported the 
existence of an autobiographical book about mohammad which depicts 
him as an active terrorist in 1975 
mohammad has denied both allegations 
mohammad tried to leave canada quietly last month through a 
secret royal canadian mounted police operation the plan called for 
him to fly to londons heathrow airport and change planes for 
algiers possibly continuing on to morocco 
authorities have not clarified exactly what went wrong mohammad 
flew to london but was put on a plane back to toronto

headquarters monday with a 323 million bid at an auction in us 
bankruptcy court 
it was the second time that elizabeth dovydenas 35 of lenox 
had outbid others for the churchs nowabandoned property which 
includes 23 buildings judge james f queenan jr had rejected her 
november bid of 18 million as too low 
id be happy either way said mrs dovydenas husband 
jonas after learning the couples bid was the highest of the four 
sealed bids at the court hearing 
the money mrs dovydenas bid for the estate will go toward 
repaying the 66 million claim she won in federal bankruptcy court 
last april against the bible speaks 
she had sued the church for donations she made as a parishioner 
from 1982 to 1986 contending that she was lied to and that her 
unquestioning trust was exploited by church founder and leader rev 
carl h stevens jr 
queenan agreed in his ruling calling the case an astonishing 
saga of clerical deceit avarice and subjugation on the part of the 
churchs founder 
the ruling was upheld in january in us district court in 
springfield but the churchs lawyers have announced they intend to 
file an appeal 
the dispute landed in federal bankrupcy court after the church 
obtained chapter 11 protection arguing that mrs dovydenas case 
could forced it into insolvency 
the claim by mrs dovydenas an heir to the dayton hudson 
department store fortune is by far the largest of the 250 
creditors who are owed a total of 7 million by the church 
her lawyer gordon walker said he doubted she will ever receive 
all the money she won although another piece of church property in 
maine recently sold for 11 million and a florida condominium and 
a mission ship are also up for sale by a courtappointed trustee 
i hope we even get 4 million the attorney said the 
question is where did all that money go were going to look into 
that question 
the bible speaks had claimed 1200 members worldwide until the 
ministry disbanded last summer saying it would never operate under 
the control of a courtappointed trustee the trustee david 
ferrari had been apppointed by the bankrutpcy court to manage the 
estate until mrs dovydenas claim could be paid 
most of the churchs 20 pastors followed stevens to baltimore 
although a few remained behind to set up another church in lenox 
the churchs lenox estate had been valued at 6 million but 
investors said town zoning restrictions made it difficult to 
develop the land 
dovydenas said monday he and his wife planned to sell some of 
the church property to developers and turn some of it into a school 
and a community center for the wealthy town the summer home of the 
boston symphony orchestra

a federal judge on monday dismissed gop 
presidential candidate pat robertsons 35 million libel suit 
against a former congressman who said the courts action unmasked 
robertson as the fraud he is 
robertson complaining he could not campaign and pursue the suit 
at the same time had asked for the dismissal he called mondays 
action a real victory 
us district judge joyce hens green formally ended the suit 
against former rep paul n mccloskey jr rcalif who had 
questioned robertsons korean war record after robertson agreed to 
pay court costs 
green signed a brief order dismissing the case with 
prejudice which means that mccloskey is legally the victor in 
the dispute 
this is a confirmation of my integrity mccloskey said in a 
telephone interview from his home in san francisco i dont like 
at the age of 60 to be called a pathological liar all over the 
united states he is admitting that he is the one who is the liar 
robertson accepted the courtcosts condition in a onesentence 
letter from his attorney douglas v rigler that was delivered to 
the judges chambers by messenger 
mccloskey said the courts service was to unmask this man as 
the fraud he is 
but robertson in a campaign appearance in wichita falls texas 
said the judge gave me what i consider a real victory 
she denied him any court costs any damages i should say he 
asked for 400000 and i have the privilege of suing him once the 
primary is over he said 
however in an opinion issued last week green quoted and 
underlined a passage from a 1985 federal appeals court opinion 
that stated dismissal of an action with prejudice is a complete 
adjudication of the issues presented by the pleadings and is a bar 
to further action between the parties 
mccloskeys attorney george lehner said he understood that this 
citation means his client cannot be sued again over any statements 
he makes about robertsons war record 
its an absolute dead letter lehner said i assume he can 
bring suit if pete says something else but not about this whole 
korean business 
under terms of the dismissal robertson must pay court fees 
printing costs and court reporters fees but not mccloskeys 
attorneys fees estimated at 400000 
the judge gave mccloskeys lawyers 20 days to file an itemized 
list of court costs to be assessed against robertson those costs 
could range between 5000 and 20000 depending on conflicting 
estimates given by lawyers for both sides 
if robertson had rejected greens dismissal he would have had 
to go to court on tuesday to begin the trial which was expected to 
last about three weeks 
the judge gave me an impossible dilemma robertson said on 
sunday the choice of either defending my honor on tuesday or 
being president and running for president 
the suit stems from mccloskeys allegation that robertson used 
the political influence of his late father sen a willis 
robertson dva to avoid combat in the korean war 
the former television evangelist filed the lawsuit in 1986 
several former marines later came forward to support mccloskeys 
allegation 
mccloskey said monday he is setting up a legal defense fund 
hoping to raise money to pay for the attorneys fees

the new president of gallaudet 
university said monday she empathizes with students and faculty at 
the alldeaf university who are protesting her appointment because 
she hears 
i do feel very deeply a sense of compassion and empathy 
elizabeth zinser said monday in a telephone interview i know 
its hurting them because they very much wanted their seventh 
president to be deaf 
but i think that what the students are expressing in general 
is their deep concern and care for the university i hope that they 
and i as soon things quiet down can begin to focus on the work 
of gallaudet university 
hundreds of students shut down gallaudet the nations only 
university for the deaf out of anger monday over the selection of 
a president who is not hearingimpaired 
zinser said she would probably begin her new job this summer 
meanwhile she will begin an intensive program to learn sign 
language and hopes to volunteer with agencies that work with the 
deaf she said 
zinser vice chancellor of academic affairs at the university of 
north carolina at greensboro since 1983 was named gallaudet 
president sunday by the schools board of trustees 
zinser said she was concerned about the student protests but not 
about what impact it might have on her presidency 
i think it would be inhuman on my part not to be concerned 
she said but my concern is for the pain that i know some 
individuals are feeling i do however believe that the board has 
made its decision 
the university belongs to a large and varied constitutency of 
which the president is a symbol she said i am not perhaps to 
some the best symbol 
i know that i cannot fully understand the experience of 
deafness without being deaf but i will become as knowledgable 
and as understanding and as empathetic as anyone can whos a 
hearing person 
zinser holds a doctorate in educational psychology from the 
university of california at berkeley before coming to north 
carolina in 1983 she was a professor dean of the school of 
nursing and senior academic officer at the university of north 
dakota at grand forks

the soviet ambassador to the united 
nations on monday urged iran and iraq to stop bombarding each 
others capitals and said the escalating war of the cities was 
a major development in the war 
we think that the war between cities adds some new dimension 
to the protracted military conflict between the two neighboring 
countries soviet ambassador aleksander belonogov said 
belonogov made his statements in an unusual news conference 
outside the un security council which later met behind closed 
doors on the iraniraq conflict 
last july the security council demanded an immediate ceasefire 
in the 7yearold war the united states is now pushing for an 
arms embargo against iran for rebuffing the resolution but the 
soviets have balked at an embargo 
belonogov said he met monday with secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar and with the president of the security council this 
month yugoslav ambassador dragoslav pejic and urged them in the 
most energetic terms to try to persuade iran and iraq to stop the 
missile attacks 
it is difficult to say what political and psychological 
consequences the war of the cities may result in belonogov said 
the position of my country is clear we are for the soonest 
possible political resolution of the conflict between iran and iraq 
and for the speediest possible implementation of the ceasefire 
resolution 
belonogov was also asked whether his country believes iran now 
accepts the ceasefire resolution as it seemed to claim in an 
ambiguous unsigned note to the council last week 
we dont think that it would be right just to disregard the 
new developments in the situation he said refusing to elaborate 
the unsigned note from iran claimed that a feb 28 letter from 
its foreign minister constituted acceptance of the resolution the 
letter however did not say that iran endorsed the resolution 
british ambassador sir crispin tickell on monday called the 
letter an undated unsigned scrap of paper 
where does that leave us he said it does not constitute 
a clear acceptance 
state department spokesman charles redman said in washington 
monday that the united states doesnt accept the unsigned note 
either and will keep pushing for an arms embargo on iran 
each of the five permanent members of the security council the 
soviet union china france britain and the united states has 
the power to veto an embargo resolution 
the soviets are close allies of iraq but have also been trying 
to improve relations with neighboring iran both iran and iraq are 
believed to be using sovietmade missiles in the war of the 
cities 
belonogov denied that what he called the defensive weapons now 
used against tehran and other cities are sovietmade

hundreds of experts from around the 
globe gather in antebellum charleston this week to seek ways to 
make the worlds cities better places to live 
the 4th international conference on making cities liveable 
which opens wednesday is being held in the united states for the 
first time 
the quality of life in our cities has become increasingly a 
national concern mayor joseph p riley jr said monday 
riley said charleston boasts many important national if not 
international examples of the liveability of cities from its 
preservation efforts to its innovative programs of lowincome 
housing to the acclaimed spoleto arts festival 
but we have so much to learn he said 
its a conference for people who are concerned about the 
quality of life in the city but isnt a professional conference 
said suzanne lennard one of the organizers and a founder of the 
center for urban wellbeing 
it brings together many different kinds of people it brings 
together city planners and architects city council presidents and 
mayors and citizens who are simply concerned about making their 
cities more liveable she said 
more than 300 people are expected to attend and more than 100 
people are scheduled to speak among the topics of discussion will 
be the design of public spaces festivals the role of markets in 
the city and a number of case studies 
the center for urban wellbeing based in southhampton ny is 
a partnership that conducts research publishes and works with 
cities on urban issues 
the first three international conferences were held in venice 
we wanted to bring it to america to make it more accessible for 
americans mrs lennard said 
one of the topics of discussion will be public art sculptures 
and other art in public places such as parks 
sculptor bonifatius stirnberg who has crafted numerous 
whimsical humansized sculptures for parks and fountains 
throughout europe will talk about his craft 
usually crafted of bronze his works are often designed for a 
particular town and tell something about its history or folklore 
they include a sculpture of carnival characters on a barge thats 
part of a fountain and a long bronze sea serpent whose tail serves 
as a park bench 
stirnberg of aachen west germany said through an interpreter 
the goal of my work is to make sculpture that is loved by the 
people that people can move and touch 
in contrast riley said in america we see so much public art 
that is not of a human scale 
riley said the power of a meeting like this is in the 
learning teaching and sharing it has the potential of improving 
the quality of life in cities all over america and beyond

the sex experts dr william masters and virginia 
johnson said monday they could not provide scientific evidence to 
support their widely publicized claim that aids is running 
rampant among heterosexuals 
when masters was asked at a contentious news conference how he 
could justify such a claim he said i simply believe this 
johnson asked the same question said im not sure we chose the 
word rampant ourselves 
on page seven of their new book they write the aids virus is 
now running rampant in the heterosexual community 
the book crisis heterosexual behavior in the age of aids 
was made available to reporters monday morning the first reports 
of its contents appeared in connection with an excerpt from the 
book published in this weeks newsweek magazine 
we dont see an explosion into the heterosexual community 
said dr peter fischinger aids coordinator for the public health 
service this does not mean we can be complacent about it he 
noted that nationwide screening of blood donors has found that only 
about one in 40000 has the potential of being infected with the 
aids virus 
the public health service has been working very hard to try to 
get the best sense of prevalence of hiv infection in the united 
states fischinger said hiv or human immunodeficiency virus is 
the virus that causes aids 
dr stephen joseph new york citys health commissioner said of 
the masters and johnson study all in all i think its greatly 
overblown he criticized them for not submitting their data to a 
scientific journal where it could be reviewed in detail by other 
researchers and he said their data did not support the sweeping 
claims they made 
i think everyone would agree there is a serious danger in 
heterosexual transmission he said but contrary to what they 
say i think the public health service people have been saying that 
for a long time 
masters and johnson and dr robert kolodny their coauthor and 
a director of the masters amp johnson institute in st louis studied 
800 men and women in atlanta st louis new york and los angeles 
the study the centerpiece of their book included only people 
who said they did not use illicit intravenous drugs and said they 
had had no homosexual or bisexual contact and no blood transfusions 
since 1977 
masters johnson and kolodny chose four hundred men and women 
who said they had had at least six sexual partners each year for 
the preceding five years and another 400 who said they had been 
monogamous 
the researchers found that 5 percent of the sexually active men 
and 7 percent of the sexually active women had antibodies to the 
aids virus meaning they had been exposed to it 
the researchers said however that these findings could not be 
used to project how many people in the united states might be 
infected with the aids virus this is not meant to be it was 
not constructed as a broad representative sample of the 
population said kolodny 
kolodny said the claim that aids is rampant among heterosexuals 
comes from studies by other researchers but other studies have 
diverged widely on the question of how rapidly aids is entering the 
nondrugusing heterosexual community 
in october for example dr thomas quinn of johns hopkins 
university in baltimore studied men and women visiting a sexually 
transmitteddiseases clinic in baltimore and found that onethird 
of the men infected with the aids virus and almost half of the 
women got the infection through heterosexual contact 
that was one of the highest reported rates of spread among 
heterosexuals at the same scientific meeting however researchers 
from new york city and the us centers for disease control 
reported that only one in 205 men coming to a sexually 
transmitteddiseases clinic in new york city was infected with aids 
in the absence of drug use homosexuality or other highrisk 
behavior

vice president george bush anticipating a 
super tuesday windfall of republican convention delegates is 
targeting illinois the biggest state in bob doles midwest base 
as the battleground that could end the kansas senators hope of a 
comeback in the gop race 
i dont know what dole does if he doesnt win illinois said 
bush campaign manager lee atwater 
i cant wait to hear their new theory if they lose illinois 
he said everyone comes up with a theory on how they can still 
win it 
a dole campaign source agreed the kansas senator must win 
illinois and said they would spend about 500000 on television 
advertising their largest budget for any state 
rich bond bushs deputy campaign manager refused to cite a 
specific figure for the campaigns advertising budget but said they 
would spent whatever it takes 
traveling with bush in missouri on monday atwater said he 
expected the vice president to win 12 or 13 of the 17 gop events on 
tuesday 
asked he was hoping for a clean sweep bush said you always 
wish for that but i certainly would never predict that its too 
much for anyone to expect 
while bush aides speculate about a possible super tuesday sweep 
that could net the vice president up to 600 gop convention 
delegates the dole camp talks about surviving the south and 
getting back to the midwest where the kansas senator has whipped 
bush in iowa minnesota and south dakota 
dole is undefeated in the midwest and illinois is in the 
midwest said dole campaign aide larry mccarthy 
the key is how well we do in the midwestern tier of states 
starting with illinois said richard wirthlin doles pollster 
but bond disputed the dole homeground advantage in illinois 
the votes arent in bob doles backyard he said the 
votes are in chicago and the collar counties the chicago suburbs 
and its hardly a typical farm state 
with 82 gop delegates at stake the illinois primary is march 
15 one week after super tuesday 
dole has already started his television campaign in illinois 
with a biographical ad that emphasizes his humble upbringing war 
service and leadership role in congress 
dole turned ronald reagans vision into an action plan for 
america said the ad which concluded with the narrator saying 
bob dole is a strong man with a record of solving tough 
problems 
dole has a strong organization in the state headed by illinois 
house minority leader lee daniels and augmented by former gov 
richard ogilvie 
backing bush was gov james thompson as well as 93 of the 
states 102 republican county chairmen 
while the dole campaign cited illinois as the staging ground for 
a comeback bush aides called the state important but not essential 
if for some reason george bush cant win illinois i still 
suspect hes going to be the nominee of the republican party 
said atwater 
the bush campaign aide cited the key role the state has played 
in past presidential nomination races 
in my mind ronald reagan was going to be the nominee when we 
won illinois in 1980 he said in my mind when mondale won 
illinois in 1984 he was going to be the nominee 
atwater and bond contended that the election calendar also is a 
problem for dole 
they cited the fact that among the key states that follow 
illinois are connecticut where bush has a big advantage and new 
york where the vice president is the only candidate to have 
delegate slates filed in every congressional district 
we get 45 delegates just for showing up said bond 
even winning a state or two added bond i dont see how 
he dole gets the upper hand can he win a state or two sure 
can he stop bush i dont think so

president reagan renewed his call monday for 
weapons for the rebels fighting nicaraguas leftist government but 
house speaker jim wright gave the request an icy reception 
in a speech to a veterans of foreign wars convention reagan 
said his congressional opponents on the issue of aid to the contra 
rebels lack courage to fight communism and said efforts to renew 
humanitarian aid for the rebels are insufficient 
now its time for congress to show that it knows you cant 
have real peace negotiations when one side has helicopter gunships 
and the other has bandages reagan told the group 
reagans spokesman marlin fitzwater said later that the 
administration still hopes wright will come up with a new contra 
aid proposal and that the white house will be encouraging efforts 
in the senate to write an aid bill 
fitzwater acknowledged that time is a problem we dont 
know how long the contras can last us aid to the rebels 
ended a week ago 
but on capitol hill where the house last week narrowly defeated 
an effort to send food and clothing to the contras wright said it 
is time to turn to other issues 
there is a weariness with the contra issue among house 
members said wright dtexas he added that he plans to begin 
mapping out a program of other legislation to bring to the floor 
including issues like welfare reform and a healthcare bill 
wright also signaled that a group of senators trying to revive 
some kind of contra aid bill could run into procedural roadblocks 
reminding reporters obliquely that the house traditionally reserves 
the right to originate any legislation to appropriate money 
im not looking for problems with a senateoriginated bill 
he said but added those who draft the legislation ought to be 
mindful of that 
wright said last weeks defeat of the democratic 308 million 
contra aid package means that the united states is left with little 
more than moral suasion as a tool to influence central american 
peace efforts 
it just throws it into the hands of the central americans 
entirely and sort of withdraws the united states for the moment 
from having any direct influence he said 
wright said he has sent telegrams to both sides in the conflict 
urging them to pursue a ceasefire agreement when they meet this 
week for the first time without a mediator and inside nicaragua 
he said he urged the sandinista side to permit a role for 
nicaraguan cardinal miguel obando y bravo whom nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega has rejected as a mediator after several 
fruitless sessions and he asked the rebels to go forward with the 
talks noting that they had been granted the highlevel direct 
talks they have been seeking 
in his speech reagan said the defeat of the contras would mean 
a grave strategic defeat for the united states 
the communists in central america understand this the soviets 
understand this its time that congress understood it too 
reagan said a soviet base on the american mainland is a pistol 
pointed at the heart of the americas 
reagan contended that the real issue before the congress is 
not the contras it is communism in central america 
referring to last weeks 216to208 vote reagan said courage 
hasnt exactly been the watchword of some opponents of contra aid 
last week aid opponents tried to pass the buck of 
responsibility for abandoning in the field the young men and women 
of the democratic resistance and that ploy failed as it should 
have

the supreme court said monday it will decide 
whether a criminal defendants right to a jury selected from a 
crosssection of the community is violated when prosecutors 
disqualify potential jurors because they are black 
the court will review the case of frank d teague sentenced to 
30 years in prison for the armed robbery of a chicago supermarket 
and for the attempted murder of police officers shot at after the 
robbery 
the justices in 1986 ruled in a case called batson vs kentucky 
that prosecutors never may disqualify potential jurors based on 
their race the court said such tactics violate equalprotection 
rights 
but a subsequent decision strictly limited the retroactive 
effect of the batson ruling 
the court said the batson decision does not apply to convicted 
criminals who like teague had exhausted direct appeals in state 
courts prior to april 30 1986 when batson was announced 
if the justices were to rule that the prosecutorial tactics used 
at teagues trial violated his sixth amendment right to 
crosssectional jury selection he would be entitled to a new trial 
even though the batson ruling came too late to help him 
presumably such a ruling would affect other prison inmates 
convictions as well 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals ruled last may that past 
supreme court decisions make clear that the fair crosssection 
requirement of the sixth amendment does not apply to the jury 
itself but only to the pool of potential jurors from which juries 
are chosen 
lawyers for teague who is black contend that his fairtrial 
rights were violated when prosecutors used all 10 of their 
socalled peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury 
the courts decision is not expected until sometime in 1989

americans took out 542 billion more in 
installment debt than they paid off in january the biggest monthly 
increase in four months and the second strong month in a row the 
government said monday 
the federal reserve said consumer credit grew at a seasonally 
adjusted rate of 106 percent in january following an increase of 
398 billion in december which translated to an annual rate of 
79 percent 
growth in both months was greater than the 59 percent rate for 
all of 1987 which represents a considerable slowdown compared with 
recent years the rate was 105 percent in 1986 
the relatively strong january report is both a reflection of job 
growth unemployment hit a nineyear low of 57 percent in 
february and a sign that the rebound in consumer confidence after 
the october stock market crash is continuing according to david 
cross an economist with the futures group a washington consulting 
firm 
what were seeing right now is a sort of soft landing for 
consumer spending said cross whose firm is predicting growth 
between 65 percent and 7 percent this year were not really 
looking for a recession to occur if anything just a bit of 
slowness in the first half of the year 
the january increase was the biggest advance since debt rose by 
643 billion in september the gains in both months were strongly 
influenced by an upturn in car sales 
auto loans rose by 154 billion in january an annual rate of 
71 percent and followed a stronger gain of 107 percent in 
december 
credit card and revolving loans grew by 20 billion in january 
a 165 percent annual rate following an increase of 193 percent a 
month earlier 
the debt category which includes bank and credit union loans not 
secured by real estate grew by 173 billion an 116 percent 
growth rate following a decline of 35 percent in december 
loans for mobile homes increased 142 million after falling 122 
million in december 
the various changes left total consumer debt at 6175 billion 
in january

an oil embargo against south africa to force the government to 
abolish apartheid within a year 
the draft resolution to be discussed when the council meets 
tuesday expresses outrage at the banning of antiapartheid 
activities and concern for the worsening of the human suffering 
resulting from the apartheid system of racial segregation

international community to impose as a first step selective 
mandatory sanctions 
under south africas system of apartheid the 26 million blacks 
have no voice in national affairs and the 5 million whites control 
the economy and maintain separate schools and districts 
the resolution circulated after three days of debate calls for 
a halt to export and sale of oil to south africa an end to further 
investment and loans a ban on imports of iron and steel a halt of 
all trade promotion and support for trade prohibition of sale of 
kruggerands and all coins minted in south africa and cessation of

the supreme court on monday set the stage for 
an important ruling on sex discrimination agreeing to study a case 
in which unconscious stereotyping allegedly played a key role 
in denying a woman an accounting firm partnership 
the justices said they will review a ruling that places a heavy 
burden on employers to disprove sex bias 
arguments in the case will be heard in the fall during the 
courts next term and a decision is not likely to be announced 
until 1989 
price waterhouse one of the nations largest accounting firms 
is accused of discriminating unlawfully against ann hopkins she 
quit the firms office here after she was denied promotion to 
partnership a move that would have made her a part owner 
ms hopkins joined the firm in 1978 and was nominated for 
partnership in 1982 the only woman among 88 candidates for 
partnership that year 
she had been very successful in getting business for the 
company winning government contracts worth an estimated 34 
million to 44 million 
of the 88 candidates 47 were invited to become partners 21 
were rejected outright and 20 including ms hopkins were placed on 
hold 
the following year she was told she would not become a partner 
and she resigned in 1984 to set up her own consulting firm 
both her critics and supporters at price waterhouse said she 
sometimes was overly aggressive too harsh impatient with her 
staff and very demanding 
one critic suggested she needed to take a course at charm 
school 
a partner in the firm who urged her promotion told her she would 
stand a better chance of becoming a partner if she would walk 
more femininely talk more femininely dress more femininely wear 
makeup have her hair styled and wear jewelry 
others said her use of profanity was a black mark against her 
ms hopkins then sued price waterhouse accusing the company of 
violating title vii of the 1964 civil rights act prohibiting 
onthejob sex disscrimination she said that sex stereotyping 
unconscious or otherwise barred her from being named partner 
the supreme court ruled in 1984 in the case of a woman denied 
partnership in a law firm that professional partnerships are 
covered by the 1964 law 
a federal judge ruled price waterhouse must prove by clear and 
convincing evidence it would not have made her a partner 
regardless of whether sexual stereotyping played a part in its 
decision 
price waterhouse said it was unable to provide such proof 
the us circuit court of appeals here last august said there is 
competent evidence that the partnership selection process at 
price waterhouse was impermissibly infected by stereotypical 
attitudes toward female candidates 
the appeals court said even if there is evidence that ms 
hopkins personality played a part in her denial of partnership 
price waterhouse is unable to prove impermissible bias was not 
the determinative factor 
the appeals court ordered further hearings to determine what 
back pay and other remedies the company must provide 
the case is price waterhouse vs hopkins 871167

metropolitan area residents exceeded the goals set 
by the better air campaign in reducing traffic volume and wood 
smoke on high pollution days and met the oxygenated fuel programs 
goals officials announced monday 
gov roy romer and denver mayor federico pena reported the 
results of the 90day better air campaign and the twomonth 
oxygenated fuels program at a news conference 
the people of this area are to be congratulated romer said 
by reducing their driving between november and january and by 
restricting wood burning on highpollution days they have reduced 
carbon monoxide pollution in the metro area by up to 17 percent 
the campaigns purpose was to reduce traffic volume and 
woodsmoke pollution on days when temperature inversions caused 
denvers carbonmonoxide levels to soar 
the project achieved a 9 percent reduction in traffic on 
highpollution days equivalent to three million miles daily and a 
10 percent reduction in carbon monoxide vehicle emissions said 
anne grady spokeswoman for the colorado department of healths air 
pollution control division she said the programs goal was an 8 
percent traffic reduction and a 9 percent reduction in carbon 
monoxide 
carbon monoxide emissions from woodburning fell 7 percent on 
highpollution days during the most recent better air campaign 
said grady and the goal was a 6 percent reduction 
pena said the 7 percent carbon monoxide reduction attributable 
to observance of woodburning bans was more than double last years 
results 
the better air campaign ran from early november until the end of 
january in its previous three years it ran for just 60 days 
the oxygenated fuels program which was launched for the first 
time in january and lasted two months required all service 
stations along the 130mile corridor along the front range between 
colorado springs and fort collins to sell only oxygenated fuels or 
fuels containing at least 15 percent oxygen 
the programs purpose was to provide a gasoline that would burn 
cleaner in car engines and thus contribute less carbon monoxide 
pollution officials said motorists were offered the choice of an 
ethergasoline blend or gasohol which contains ethyl alcohol 
grady said the oxy fuels program was right on target in its goal 
of reducing ambient carbonmonoxide levels by 8 percent to 10 
percent the reduction was in the 8 percent to 95 percent range 
she said

hatching expected between april 28 and may 3 hanscom said 
now we incubate the egg according to the parameters that have 
worked so well in the past and hope we can hatch a healthy 
condor chick he said 
all 27 living california condors are in captivity fourteen are 
kept at the wild animal park and 13 at the los angeles zoo 
thirteen of the 27 birds were hatched in captivity in an effort 
to build a breeding flock to save the rare birds from extinction 
each of those eggs were taken from nests in the wild 
the breeding program has been conducted at the san diego zoo and 
its affiliate the wild animal park since 1983 in cooperation with 
state and federal wildlife officials 
the last known wild condor was captured in april 1987 by 
government biologists after it was determined the carrioneating 
birds existence was threatened by lead poisoning in their food 
supply and human encroachment upon their central california habitat 
our success or failure has pivoted on the captive production 
of a fertile egg and thats what weve got hanscom said of the 
4dayold egg 
meanwhile the parents of the egg were said to be doing well 
keepers removed the shell from its nest soon after it was laid to 
stimulate more breeding activity by the pair which hanscom said 
has begun 
thats real positive he said that would lead us to hope 
for the production of a second egg which could come as early as 30 
days after the first egg 
the parents are doing fine the egg is doing fine and the 
keepers are doing fine

more than 1 million serious crimes were 
reported in florida last year a record number blamed in part on 
the spread of crack cocaine and other drugs authorities 
announced monday 
the number of reported homicides rapes robberies assaults 
burglaries larcenies and motor vehicle thefts rose 63 percent to 
go over the 1 million mark for the first time to 1021283 said 
robert dempsey commissioner of the florida department of law 
enforcement 
as you know the crime rate is driven to a large extent by the 
drug problem there is no question about that dempsey said 
he urged gov bob martinez and the legislature to consider 
increasing spending for criminal justice presently he said 6 
percent of an 185 billion budget is devoted to the criminal 
justice system which includes law enforcement and the courts he 
said 
its intolerable we need to do something about addressing 
credibility in the criminal justice area dempsey said we need 
to address the career criminals the jail situation and some of the 
weaknesses in the socalled criminal justice system which as many 
of you know is no system at all 
dempsey also said citizens need to start a grassroots campaign 
to help prevent violence and property thefts increases in property 
crime particularly in some of the more rural counties can be 
directly attributed to the increase of the powerful crack form of 
cocaine the commissioner said 
anybody who tells you the drug problem is leveling off is in 
fairyland they dont know whats happening he said 
the florida figures released monday were preliminary a complete 
report was expected to be issued later this year 
the commissioner said florida continues to lead other states in 
crime rates or the number of crimes reported per 100000 
population he compared floridas 1987 figures with figures 
reported by other states in 1986 
we have the highest crime rate in the nation said dempsey 
department spokesman john joyce said floridas percapita crime 
rate which increased by 29 percent in 1987 has been 
significantly higher in past years than the figures reported by 
other states since florida is one of the first to release its 
figures new data was unavailable in other states 
in 1986 florida had 8238 serious crimes reported per 100000 
population compared with 7408 in texas 7322 in arizona 7081 
in oregon 7032 in colorado 6880 in washington 6763 in 
california 6626 in new mexico 64915 in michigan and 6290 in 
nevada 
the district of columbia actually had the highest of all with 
8339 per 100000 population 
in florida the total arrests for cocaine last year were up 328 
percent over 1986 while property crimes increased 67 percent over 
1986 the number of motor vehicle thefts rose by 164 percent and 
aggravated assaults showed a 31 percent increase 
the number of reported murders and rapes was slightly down 
homicides declined from 1371 to 1368 and rapes declined from 
6153 to 6017 
more police officers were assaulted and killed in 1987 than the 
previous year 10 compared with six assaults on police officers 
rose from 7289 in 1986 to 7833 in 1987 
dempsey acknowledged that the overall crime increase was not as 
high as had been reported in recent years from 1985 to 1986 his 
department reported a 79 percent increase the increase was 114 
percent from 1984 to 1985 
its true the rate of increase is dropping but it is still an 
increase dempsey said

a 31month pretrial detention ended 
monday for a defendant in the wells fargo robbery case after a 
judge approved arrangements for his 1 million bond 
juan segarra palmer was released after us district judge peter 
dorsey signed the papers segarra palmer and another wells fargo 
defendant filiberto ojeda rios had been held without bond longer 
than any other defendants in federal judicial history 
segarra palmers father enrique segarra testified before a 
us magistrate earlier monday that his son would be disgraced 
personally and politically if he failed to appear for trial on 
charges in the 1983 robbery of 7 million from a wells fargo depot 
in west hartford 
he is a person of great character enrique segarra said 
if he said he will be here he will be here 
im happy but i have to say the real issue is not my 
freedom harvardeducated segarra palmer 38 said as he walked 
out of court the real issue is the freedom of puerto rico and 
preventive detention 
segarra palmer who was arrested in august 1985 in puerto rico 
was held without bond until last month when us district judge t 
emmet clarie set bond at 1 million 
clarie has however refused to do the same for ojeda rios 
saying the defendant could flee to avoid prosecution 
segarra palmers bond is secured partly by 500000 in property 
owned by 11 people in the town of naranjito puerto rico the 
hometown of his wife luz berrios berrios another wells fargo 
defendant who has been free on bond for some time 
the other 500000 is unsecured but his parents and three 
siblings signed agreements to pay the money should segarra palmer 
not appear for trial 
under terms of his bond segarra palmer cannot leave hartford 
must be home by 10 pm each night and agreed that the government 
has the right to try him in absentia should he flee the government 
also plans to require him to wear an electronic bracelet to monitor 
his movements but none of the devices are available in hartford 
said his attorney leonard weinglass 
sixteen people are awaiting trial in the wells fargo robbery 
which the government contends was masterminded by los matcheros a 
radical sometimes violent group advocating puerto rican 
independence 
victor gerena of hartford the wells fargo guard authorities 
allege carried out the robbery hasnt been captured prosecutors 
say they think he is in cuba 
pretrial hearings in the case began 14 months ago and are 
expected to last several more months

republican presidential rivals searched monday for a way to stop 
george bush from a clean sweep on super tuesday while democrats 
scoured the south for the votes that could propel one of them out 
of the tightly bunched pack on the biggest primary day in us 
history 
vice president bush said a sweep of the 17 gop primaries was 
too much for anyone to expect but he was leading polls in 
virtually every super tuesday state except missouri where sen bob 
dole of kansas had a narrow edge 
even dole conceded in oklahoma city its fair to say george 
bush has a good margin but said the race is tight in oklahoma 
missouri and north carolina 
earlier the kansas senator said in birmingham ala my 
philosophy in the south ought to sell like hotcakes but so far it 
isnt happening bush is getting a lot of ruboff from ronald 
reagan 
dole claimed polls show that i beat all the democrats bush 
doesnt beat any of them we ought to nominate a winner instead 
of a loser 
gov michael dukakis of massachusetts hoping to emerge from the 
super tuesday contests in his home state and 20 others with a 
delegate lead campaigned at a retirees condominium development in 
north miami beach and picked up the backing of annie ackerman 74 
a onetime chicago ward organizer now known for her prowess in 
turning retirees out to vote she called him a person of 
integrity who gets things done and a mensch using the 
yiddish word for good man 
asked if super tuesday was a flop in bringing moderate and 
conservative democrats back to the partys fold the governor 
replied its not been a flop for mike dukakis 
four of his rivals jesse jackson richard gephardt albert 
gore jr and gary hart were in texas monday 
jackson hoping the allegiance of black voters throughout the 
south will give him his finest hour in two runs for the presidency 
visited an aids clinic in dallas and journeyed to brownsville 
texas where he pledged to fight efforts to make english the 
official language of the united states 
we are a great nation we can speak more than one language 
said jackson 
gephardt the missouri congressman who has staked his campaign 
on a tough stance against countries with unfair trade practices 
made a pitch in dallas for an oil import fee and campaigned in san 
antonio in front of a landmark 
were standing today in front of the alamo a place where 
there was a fight for independence gephardt said this 
election in 1988 is a fight again for the independence of america 
the fight for us to regain control of our economic destiny 
in dallas outside a plant that has cut its production of oil 
field equipment nearly in half gephardt said anyone like al 
gore or michael dukakis who tells you that theyre for making 
america energyindependent without being for an oil import fee is 
simply trying to deceive you in a shameful way 
somethings happening out there gore said insisting the 
undecided vote was breaking his way he said the democrats would 
have a twoman race after tuesday and he would be one of the two 
gore got a boost from sen sam nunn of georgia who left word 
after he departed on a trip to the soviet union that he had cast an 
absentee ballot for the tennessee senator 
pat robertson raised again his claim that there are soviet 
missiles in cuba telling a satellite radio audience in 18 states 
i dont think the missiles ever got taken out in 62 and i am 
somewhat convinced that more missiles have been introduced 
a federal judge in washington dismissed robertsons 35 million 
libel suit against former rep pete mccloskey who questioned his 
korean war record the judge said mccloskey was the prevailing 
party in the acrimonious lawsuit robertson agreed to pay court 
costs but not mccloskeys legal fees 
super tuesday the biggest primary day in history saw gop 
voters go the primary polls in 17 states and democrats choose 
candidates in 20 states there are 712 republican and 1307 
democratic delegates at stake 
dukakis was hoping for a strong harvest of delegates from texas 
florida and maryland as well as massachusetts rhode island and 
washington state 
bush talking with reporters on air force ii en route to 
columbia mo was asked about the possibility of a sweep you 
always wish for that but i certainly would never predict that 
its took much for anyone to expect he replied 
bush who clobbered dole robertson and jack kemp in south 
carolinas primary on saturday admitted he was tired 
its been a difficult effort leading up to super tuesday he 
said adding that on tuesday itself weve got a pretty relaxing 
day except for the tension factor

pat robertson renewed his contention that 
there are soviet missiles in cuba on monday and also said the 
federal reserve board was unconstitutional 
earlier in wichita falls texas the republican presidential 
candidate said he was satisfied with a federal judges dismissal of 
his libel suit against a former congressman who had questioned 
robertsons war record 
in texas the biggest super tuesday prize with 111 gop 
delegates robertson talked about military needs and about his 
contentions concerning missiles 
in new england they thought it was a gaffe when i said there 
were missiles in cuba but those cubans in florida dont believe 
its a gaffe they believe theres russian missiles in cuba he 
said 
later in a callin show on shreveports kflo radio he said 
everybody in the miami area almost without exception 
certainly 95 percent of those cubanamericans know in their hearts 
that there are missiles in cuba i dont think the missiles ever 
got taken out in 62 and i am somewhat convinced that more 
missiles have been introduced 
to support his contention he said cuban leader fidel has denied 
the missiles are there and has criticized robertson for saying they 
are 
on other subjects raised on the callin show robertson said 
there has been filed by a united states senator from 
montana a suit in the federal court alleging that the federal 
reserve board is unconstitutional i think its true 
the supreme court needs people like justices antonin scalia 
william rehnquist and defeated nominee robert bork people like 
that who honor the constitution as it was written 
not one of the trading partners of america truly is dealing 
fairly with us theyre either restricting imports into their 
country on the one hand or they are subsidizing unfairly exports 
from their country to us 
i believe in my heart and from some indication from some 
people who ive talked to that there are american servicemen still 
in laos they arent in vietnam theyre in laos i believe we 
could put a throttlehold around some of those southeast asian 
nations to make them insist those missinginaction people come 
out of there 
raising the possibility of an alternative to the united 
nations i think if we had an alternate organization of free 
nations democratic nations who did not commit terrorism and did 
not torture and abuse their own citizens we could have the power 
of the world and we could exclude from that agency the soviet 
union the east bloc countries and these other dictators that are 
practicing slavery and what have you against their people 
in washington a us district court judge dismissed robertsons 
35 million suit against former rep paul n mccloskey jr who had 
accused robertson of ducking combat duty during the korean war 
the judge gave me what i consider a real victory robertson 
said during a news conference at wichita falls municipal airport 
however mccloskey said this is a confirmation of my 
integrity robertson in asking that the suit be dropped is 
admitting that he is the one who is the liar mccloskey said 
the courts service was to unmask this man as the fraud he is 
robertson had said he had to ask that the suit be dismissed 
since he couldnt pursue the presidency and go through the trial 
that was to start on tuesday

mikhail s gorbachev has told factory workers not 
to be discouraged by slow improvements in their standard of living 
and to have faith in his overhaul of the economy 
he visited the enormous first state ball bearing plant in 
moscow his first meeting with rankandfile workers since a 
sweeping law took effect jan 1 giving factories more financial 
independence from central ministries 
gorbachev said he was particularly sensitive to complaints about 
poor housing and food and said they were top priorities for 
improvement 
the 57yearold soviet leader visited the factory friday but 
media did not report on the trip until monday why the reports were 
delayed was not clear 
of course we have a sufficient number of problems gorbachev 
told the workers part of them are left from the past others 
were born today in the course of restructuring in the process of 
realizing economic reforms thats natural but i have the 
impression that you havent panicked and i would say are 
optimistically looking to the future and confidently going 
forward 
gorbachev has visited factories several times since becoming 
communist party general secretary three years ago highlighting the 
importance he attaches to workers roles in reviving the sluggish 
soviet economy 
the ball bearing plant employs 20000 factory and office 
workers gorbachev said he wanted to get a firsthand look at how 
the governments new economic reforms are being implemented 
for politics the most important thing is to know the mood of 
the people to feel the pulse of life gorbachev said in remarks 
carried by the official news agency tass 
he explained to the workers why some of his economic policies 
may be hard to swallow because they mean harder work and in some 
cases less pay salaries he said must be adjusted according to 
the productivity and quality of labor 
how can you pay someone a full ruble if he hasnt earned it 
what will he buy with this money he said 
he said the reason desired goods have not been available in 
stores is that workers were guaranteed salaries whether or not they 
did their jobs properly 
under the new law managers at factories responsible for 60 
percent of the countrys industrial output can bargain with 
suppliers and wholesale customers for some products enterprises 
are free to keep some of their profits but those that are 
unsuccessful are liable to be declared bankrupt the factories set 
workers salaries according to the quality of their work 
gorbachev critcized plant managers who try to find an easy way 
out of improving output by buying foreign equipment 
obviously you must buy some things but only that which is 
absolutely necessary and you should rely on your own domestic 
machinebuilding on the achievements of our engineering 
he assured the workers socialism will not be threatened by the 
countrys growing private enterprises known as cooperatives 
its understood that we need industrious and honest 
initiative but not of the kind of some cooperatives which exploit 
a deficit and engage in outright moneygrabbing gorbachev said 
limited private enterprise has been allowed to supplement 
staterun enterprises since may 1987 prices of the goods and 
services produced by cooperatives are generally much higher but 
gorbachev told the workers the government plans to get its fair 
share of profits through a progressive tax

routine strip searches of children awaiting 
deportation are unconstitutional a federal judge ruled monday 
saying immigration agents must first have a reasonable suspicion 
that drugs or weapons have been hidden 
us district judge robert kelleher rejected an immigration and 
naturalization service argument that the bodycavity searches are 
needed because adults will use children as couriers if agents 
cannot search them 
children confined by the ins are not charged with any criminal 
offense let alone an offense that might indicate a propensity to 
conceal weapons or contraband on their persons kelleher ruled 
in 1987 of 84000 aliens searched there were 20 discoveries of 
contraband or weapons only four of which were related to 
juveniles kelleher noted 
his ruling came in a classaction suit filed in 1985 by a 
coalition of immigrants rights groups that challenged what they 
described as routine stripsearches of children upon admission to 
ins detention facilities and following all visits with anyone other 
than attorneys 
children are particularly susceptible to trauma from strip 
searches kelleher said he rejected an argument by assistant us 
attorney ian fan that children from central america have no 
expectation of privacy when arrested here 
many carry the expectation of liberty opportunity and a 
better life the embodiment of which is our constitution 
kelleher wrote 
only children are affected by the ruling john hagar an 
american civil liberties union lawyer involved in the suit said 
the ruling covers all nine states in the ins western region

washington ap the justice departments nazihunting unit has 
identified 9800 people as former concentration camp guards and 
said monday it will have them placed on the immigration watch list 
of individuals to be barred from the united states 
the office of special investigations compiled the names with the 
assistance of a sophisticated new computer database 
names of suspected criminals and nazi persecutors are 
systematically checked against immigration records to determine if 
they are in the united states 
the names of individuals not found to be in this country are 
included in the watch list to prevent them from entering 
osi has listed thousands of such people in the past few years 
but the 9800 now to be placed on the watch list of the us 
immigration and naturalization service for serving as 
concentration and death camp guards is probably the greatest 
number to be added at one time said the offices chief neal 
sher 
the watch list includes people who are prohibited from entering 
the united states under a federal law barring individuals who 
assisted or otherwise participated in nazisponsored persecution 
the provision known as the holtzman amendment was invoked when 
austrian president kurt waldheim was placed on the watch list last 
year following a decision by attorney general edwin meese iii 
the justice department cited evidence that waldheim had 
participated in activities amounting to persecution of jews and 
others in greece and yugoslavia in world war ii when he was a 
german army intelligence officer 
the immigration watch list contains some 40000 names in 
addition to those participating in nazidirected persecution the 
list contains the names of criminals known terrorists communists 
or people who have been deported from the united states 
duke austin an ins spokesman said names submitted by the 
office of special investigations are routinely added to the watch 
list

the reagan administration renewed its request 
on monday for an early response from israel to a us middle 
east peace initiative 
it also said it welcomed the the support and advice of 30 
senators who contend israel should be willing to give up control of 
occupied land in return for middle east peace 
at the state department spokesman charles redman said the 
administration is looking for a reply to secretary of state george 
p shultzs plan to set up negotiations on palestinian selfrule by 
may 1 
redmans comment appeared to be directed to israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir who is due in washington next week for 
meetings with president reagan and shultz 
we believe all the parties understand and appreciate the 
reason that weve asked for these kind of responses redman said 
shultz just returned from a middle east trip during which he 
promoted a plan to bring israel jordan syria and palestinian 
arabs to a peace conference by may 1 one goal is to stop violence 
in the israelioccupied gaza strip and west bank regions that has 
claimed some 80 arab lives in three months 
shultz briefed regan on monday on his travels 
on sunday shamir blocked a decision by the israeli cabinet on 
the us initiative he said he would permit a vote after he 
returns from his talks in washington but israeli foreign minister 
shimon peres had demanded a cabinet decision before shamir departed 
redman avoided a direct reaction to shamirs move but he went 
on to call for an early response from israel and the three arab 
governments jordan egypt and syria to whom shultz submitted 
his plan 
shultz said during his middle east travels last week that he 
hoped for a reply within about 10 days he said he believed in 
deadlines as a way of accelerating action 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater was asked about 
the letter from the 23 democrats and seven republicans a group 
that included several strong supporters of the jewish state 
the senators noted that israel has in the past supported the 
idea of land for peace by returning the sinai peninsula to 
egypt but they cited a statement by shamir that this expression 
of territory for peace is not accepted by me 
we hope that the prime ministers statement did not indicate 
that israel is abandoning a policy that offers the best hope for 
longterm peace said the letter dated march 3 
the administration welcomes the support and advice from this 
group they are senators of considerable stature and interest and 
involvment in middle east affairs fitzwater told reporters 
we are in the midst of an ongoing processs the views of these 
senators are helpful to us and probably instructive to other 
parties in the region he added 
the spokesman said the administration was involved in a process 
that involves a blend of some new ideas and new beliefs but he 
refused to comment further 
at the state department redman said shultz would respond to the 
letter he declined to address the matter further except to say 
the administration prefers to maintain a certain discreet 
distance in the mideast peace process 
when he returned saturday from the middle east shultz expressed 
no criticism of shamirs position he said the prime minister and 
peres agreed that israels annexation of territory could be a topic 
for negotiations 
peres and his labor party have openly endorsed shultzs 
proposals while shamir and his likud party have not 
strong supporters of israel signing the letter included senators

afford to develop the new midgetman nuclear missile favored by many 
congressional leaders said he would press for salary bonuses for 
pilots and make it easier for young pilots to stay in the cockpit 
and would shut down at least three air force bases if congress let 
him 
the fourstar general added the public shouldnt be too 
concerned by press reports of delays in flight testing the new 
stealth bomber and said he intends to repair strained 
relations with congress with a new openness about the onset of 
contracting problems 
welch was interviewed by the associated press on the eve of 
congressional hearings on the air forces fiscal 1989 budget that 
budget blueprint designed to comply with a deficitreduction plan 
cuts air force spending authority by 10 billion compared with what 
the service wanted and eliminates more than 23000 activeduty job 
slots 
the 53yearold welch said it already was clear when he took 
over the air force in july 1986 that military spending was going to 
be slashed 
but we thought at the worst we would level off welch 
added we never expected a real decline we were certainly not 
expecting that from 1985 through 1989 there would be a 13 percent 
overall decline in real buying power 
the only way to cope with such cuts welch continued is to 
reduce the size of the force otherwise too little money is spread 
too thinly to maintain combat readiness he said 
to keep a ready force well have to have a somewhat smaller 
force the general said and we will be deferring some things 
delaying some things 
among the programs taking a large cut is the midgetman missile 
a onewarhead nuclear missile that would be deployed on a 
trucklike launcher to make it more survivable the air force would 
like to kill the program outright but requested enough money to 
keep research going until a new administration makes a final 
decision 
welch said he knew that congressional democrats favored the 
project but the midgetman is so expensive it makes more sense to 
develop a mobile rail launcher for the existing 10warhead mx 
missile he said 
deploying the midgetman would cost 36 billion and the only 
place we can find to take another 36 billion is out of 
conventional forces welch said 
thats too high of a pricetag for an incremental contribution 
to deterrence he added 
asked what would happen if congress refused money for both the 
midgetman or a railmobile mx welch replied i think that would 
be absolutely irresponsible 
turning to other topics welch said

air force relations with congress are strained because of a 
perception the service tried to cover up problems with the b1b 
bomber that is an absolutely false charge welch said because 
in truth the air force itself was badly surprised by the lag in 
the development of b1b radarjamming gear 
nonetheless we are now going to great pains to keep the 
congress thoroughly informed on anything that looks like a 
problem 
theres no reason for concern at this point about a delay in 
flight testing the radarevading stealth or b2 bomber sources 
have said the first flight test was pushed back four months to 
august because of technical problems 
i think weve been very realistic about the b2 welch 
said unlike some other programs we didnt say five years in 
advance that were going to fly that airplane on the 23rd of may 
we knew better 
the air force is asking for money to pay its pilots a salary 
bonus because reenlistment rates have fallen to unacceptable 
levels retention rates are running about 48 percent compared with 
the target 60 percent and for the first time in years the air 
force expects to end fiscal 1989 with an overall shortage of pilots 
22312 on duty compared with 22556 needed 
the air force also will try to keep its pilots happy by 
changing promotion policies to make it clear to young lieutenants 
and captains they should concentrate on flying and not worry about 
finding staff jobs to make them more promotable 
and if he had his druthers he would try to save money by 
closing unneeded bases welch declined to identify his candidates 
but said three bases could probably be closed quickly

federal testing of the nations pork supply is 
being stepped up immediately as part of a crackdown on illegally 
high traces of a suspected cancercausing drug used widely by hog 
producers the agriculture department said monday 
officials said the departments food safety and inspection 
service will initiate random sampling of hog carcasses in 100 of 
the nations largest swine slaughter plants for laboratory tests to 
determine levels of sulfamethazine 
usda officials on feb 4 had announced their goal was to 
eliminate violative levels of the drug sulfamethazine in hogs 
marketed in the united states 
two hog carcasses will be tested at each plant during the 
initial phase of the program if one or both hogs are found to 
contain drug traces at or above the permitted level of 01 part per 
million the plant will be subjected to more intensive testing 
hog carcasses found to be within the drugs permitted level will 
be released for consumption those with higher residues will be 
condemned 
a new sulfaonsite sos procedure for making quick 
screening tests in the plants without sending samples to 
laboratories for more detailed timeconsuming tests also is being 
incorporated into the program said lester m crawford fsis 
administrator 
sulfamethazine is used in swine to treat or prevent a number of 
diseases and also is used in subtherapeutic dosages in feed to 
promote faster growth and to improve weight gains illegally high 
traces of the drug have been a problem in an average of about 5 
percent of the hogs going to slaughter 
a study by the food and drug administrations national center 
for toxicological research in arkansas tentatively determined that 
sulfamethazine causes tumors in the thyroid glands of mice 
crawford said last month when the new regulatory effort was 
announced

its too soon to consider bailing out the 
federal insurance fund for savings institutions or merging it with 
the healthier funds for commercial banks and credit unions the 
nations top regulator of sampls said monday 
i think thats vastly premature said m danny wall 
chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
wall speaking to the national association of federal credit 
unions said the federal savings and loan insurance corp which 
backs sampl deposits up to 100000 has about 20 billion to work 
with over the next three years 
president reagan in august signed legislation recapitalizing 
fslic which was technically insolvent and unable to deal with 
failed sampls the legislation provides 108 billion over three 
years from the sale of bonds to be paid off by a special 
assessment on profitable institutions 
wall said its too soon to determine whether that will be enough 
to handle the industrys problems particularly in the southwest 
where sampls have been hard hit by the faltering energy industry and 
the consequent moribund real estate market 
theres no way of knowing what the regional economies will 
be or will have been in three years a rebound could occur in 
texas it could occur in other areas of the country it could blow 
all of our problems completely out of the water in a positive 
way wall said 
his comments came less than a week after two thrift industry 
lobby groups began discussing the future of the insurance fund 
a committee of the us league of savings institutions the 
largest sampl trade association discussed a plan that would require 
billions of taxpayer dollars to bail out the ailing thrift industry 
according to mark clark a vice president of the league the 
committee talked about a number of possible scenarios including 
one that envisioned the issue of government notes to sampls the 
notes would be traded for bad loans owned by sampls and would be 
guaranteed by the us treasury 
clark said the committee meeting was simply a brainstorming 
session and the plan is by no stretch of the imagination a 
proposal 
the us league discussion as well as a proposal to merge 
insurance funds are particularly controversial because the thrift 
industry seeking a smaller burden on healthy sampls argued for a 
smaller recapitalization of fslic 
the national council of savings institutions another trade 
association is proposing as a contingency plan a merger of fslic 
with the federal deposit insurance fund which had 183 billion at 
the end of 1987 
the plan is unpopular with banks which pay a premium for 
deposit insurance that is less than half the premium paid by 
savings institutions a merger with the national credit union share 
insurance fund which has about 13 billion is equally unpopular 
with that industry 
john t morgan chairman of the council said last week that 
fslic likely wont have enough money to take care of all insolvent 
sampls wall talked of resolving the cases of 50 insolvent sampls this 
year in addition to about 100 cases in texas losses for the 
industry as a whole are expected to surpass 4 billion for 1987 
morgan argues that theres a limit to how much more healthy sampls 
can contribute and that congress will not want to earmark tax money 
without first tapping into the other insurance funds 
rep gerald kleckza dwis has introduced legislation that 
would merge the three insurance funds as well as the federal 
agencies that regulate the three segments of the financial system 
the council however would keep the regulatory agencies separate 
wall said he saw little prospect at least in the near term 
that congress would approve a merger of the funds or of the 
regulatory apparatus and he argued that they were better left apart

the supreme court on monday postponed until 
later in the year a ruling in a multibilliondollar battle over 
socalled gray market goods the growing business that allows 
consumers to purchase costly imports at steep discounts 
the justices announced they again will hear arguments in the 
case in april with a decision expected by july 
the case will be reargued with justice anthony m kennedy who 
joined the court last month taking part in the deliberations 
kennedys participation in the case will give the court six 
members a quorum to consider the underlying dispute 
kennedy did not take part as the court ruled 53 on monday 
that the court of international trade does not have exclusive 
authority over the dispute the majority said that a federal judge 
properly considered the case 
the three justices who dissented did so on a procedural issue 
they said the federal courts lacked jurisdiction a decision that 
would in effect disqualify them from considering the merits of the 
case 
the dispute is over interpretation of the federal tariff act of 
1930 the us customs service says the law allows gray market 
goods into the country without approval from trademark owners 
two leading discount distributors k mart corp and 47th street 
photo inc of new york city also are defending the customs service 
regulations 
typically the discount companies buy trademarked products in 
the united states more cheaply than do the owners of the us 
trademarks 
some 60 major companies that own trademarks banded together to 
form the coalition to preserve the integrity of american trademarks 
and challenge the customs service regulations 
a federal judge upheld the customs service regulations but the 
us circuit court of appeals here ruled last year that the rules 
are invalid under the 1930 tariff act 
the statute prohibits unauthorized imports of any merchandise 
of foreign manufacture if such merchandise bears a trademark 
owned by a citizen of or by a corporation or association created 
or organized within the united states 
the customs service says the law protects only american 
companies that purchase trademarks from independent foreign 
manufacturers and does not protect american subsidiaries 
affiliates or parent companies of foreign manufacturers 
justice william j brennan wrote mondays opinion upholding the 
authority of the federal courts to rule in the dispute he was 
joined by justices byron r white thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens 
dissenting on the jurisdictional issue were chief justice 
william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia and sandra day

a television expose showing city workers goofing 
off has added fuel to a campaign to recall mayor federico pena the 
mayors opponents said monday 
a top public works official and two street workers lost their 
jobs and pena suspended four others following the kusatv report 
last week about city street crews 
the mayor who announced the action over the weekend said he 
will continue his investigation of the allegations and within the 
next week expects to discipline several midlevel supervisors in 
the public works department the citys largest agency with 1770 
employees 
meanwhile marge doty chairwoman of the metropolitan action 
committee which is pushing the pena recall said the revelations 
have added impetus to our movement absolutely 
the campaign has half the petition signatures needed to force an 
election to replace pena who was reelected to a second threeyear 
term last year ms doty said she has not counted how many 
signatures have been gathered on the 1200 petitions being 
circulated 
a kusa reporter and cameraman using an unmarked car followed 
six city street crews around for several days to see what they 
accomplished only two crews were shown working without excessive 
breaks in one case a pothole repair crew did no work at all 
during an eighthour period spending the time visiting several 
food stores and loafing near parks 
lee ramirez deputy manager of the public works department 
resigned following the reports and pena then fired two workers and 
suspended four others 
pena told a news conference that ramirez was a hardworking 
and dedicated employee who had the fortitude to tender his 
resignation in the best interest of the city and i agree with that 
conclusion 
steve newman executive director of the colorado chapter of the 
american federation of state county and municipal employees said 
two of the disciplined public works employees are innocent and 
their punishments would be appealed 
he also blamed the departments problems which include a 1 
million budget deficit on poor management nepotism cronyism and 
missing equipment 
i will be meeting with the mayor this week probably on 
thursday and i will have a long list of documented problems and 
incidents weve brought to their attention he said hopefully 
this time hell deal with it 
the movement to recall pena began after citizens complained of 
unplowed impassable streets following a christmas weekend 
snowstorm 
the metropolitan action committee has until midapril to collect 
40000 petition signatures 
gov roy romer and three other democratic leaders on saturday 
announced their opposition to the recall drive 
properly filling potholes is an issue worth debating but 
not serious enough to merit a recall election the governor said 
sen tim wirth dcolo said pena is the person who has 
finally broken loose the airport and has made the convention center 
come closer to being a reality those are the issues it seems to me 
that we ought to be talking about 
denver is close to reaching agreement to build a new 4 billion 
airport in neighboring adams county to replace stapleton 
international airport and it will begin construction soon on a 
115 million convention center

rep jack kemp said monday he would press 
on with his republican presidential campaign regardless of the 
outcome of the super tuesday contests 
kemp told a news conference at the state capitol that his 
disappointing showing in the race so far had not caused him to 
consider dropping out 
im running for ideas for a cause to keep the reagan 
revolution alive he said 
he said he did not know how he would do on super tuesday but 
thought the race would remain open and he said he planned to press 
his campaign in next weeks illinois primary 
kemp said he saw himself as a bridge candidate whom 
followers of vice president george bush kansas sen bob dole and 
former television evangelist pat robertson all could turn to if the 
race is not wrapped up by the time of the republican national 
convention 
i think ultimately that the republican party is going to want 
a conservative to follow ronald reagan he said 
he repeated his assertion that he is not interested in the vice 
presidential nomination 
i dont expect it i dont think it will be offered i dont 
want it and besides im a quarterback and not a lineman said 
the former professional football player 
kemp conceded that the oil and agriculture industries had not 
shared fully in the economic successes of the reagan 
administration but he said he did not favor an oil import fee 
calling that a quick fix he said lower interest rates would 
help the energy industry more in the long run 
he also advocated repealing the windfall profits tax and called 
for further deregulation of natural gas 
in a speech to the oklahoma legislature prior to the news 
conference kemp drew applause when he denounced panamanian 
strongman manuel antonio noriega and called for continued support 
of the contras in nicaragua 
he said it would be a big mistake for the united states to 
accept a communist base in nicaragua he said that would pose a 
threat to the panama canal and nicaraguas neighbors and 
ultimately to mexico

secretary of state george p shultz met monday 
with chinese foreign minister wu xueqian and said the united states 
is prepared to increase high technology exports to china 
during toasts following their state department luncheon the two 
leaders hailed the progress in bilateral relations and made almost 
no reference to issues which divide them 
chief among them is chinas reported sales of military weaponry 
to iran in defiance of us efforts at the united nations to win 
support for a worldwide arms embargo against iran the 
administration has been seeking assurances from china that it will 
not veto an embargo resolution 
the reagan administration has generally refrained from public 
condemnations of the chinese sales and shultz on monday alluded 
only to press reports in both countries of uschinese 
differences on the persian gulf war 
administration officials have indicated a willingness to 
increase high technology exports to china in exchange for a chinese 
commitment to halt delivery of weapons to iran 
although shultz made no direct link between the two issues he 
indicated us interest in increasing sales of sophisticated 
technology to china 
over the last five years the united states has significantly 
liberalized its controls over technology exports to china and we 
are prepared to do more to ensure us exporters remain competitive 
in the china market he said 
last october the united states retaliated against china for 
selling silkworm antiship missiles to iran by suspending the 
process under which china had been given increasing access to us 
products with advanced technology 
since then china has said it has stopped selling silkworms to 
iran a us official speaking friday on condition of anonymity 
said our information is that theyve been living up to that 
still before resuming liberalization of the high technology 
trade we want to be sure were in sync with the chinese on what 
were talking about the official said we believe the chinese 
position has been responsive to our concerns but we want to be 
sure that this responsiveness will continue 
although no details of their private talks were disclosed 
shultz also was expected to discuss with wu the us proposal for 
direct arabisraeli peace talks 
us officials who asked not to be identified said shultzs 
talks with wu were cordial and covered a range of international 
issues 
they said discussions later in the week will focus on human 
rights and the persian gulf situation 
shultz is trying to structure a peace conference in which the 
united states the soviet union china britain and france would 
serve as sponsors but without the power to impose the terms of a 
settlement 
shultz made no reference in his remarks to recent antichinese 
rioting in tibet state department spokesman charles redman said 
between three and nine people are believed to have been killed and 
he expressed deep concern over the human rights situation in tibet 
he also reiterated the us view that tibet is an integral part 
of china 
shultz discussing shared interests of the two countries said 
both have opposed the soviet occupation of afghanistan and the 
vietnamese military intervention in cambodia 
the united states is convinced that a secure china is in the 
interest not only of china but of the us and the states of the 
east asian region shultz said 
wu in turn said there is great potential for continued 
development of uschinese relations yet there are also 
obstacles and difficulties 
therefore our two sides have no reason to rest content with 
the present status he said 
wu also met with defense secretary frank c carlucci on monday 
he will meet with president reagan on tuesday

the soviet union on monday sought an 
urgent security council meeting to demand an end to the iraniraq 
war of the cities and the united states insisted anew on an 
arms embargo against iran 
soviet ambassador alexander m belonogov told reporters he 
expected a meeting of the 15member council by wednesday he said 
the soviets will introduce a resolution demanding an end to the 
devastating missile bombardment of both capitals 
moscow however has been reluctant to push for a punitive arms 
embargo against iran for delay in complying with a ceasefire as 
demanded by the council last july 20 the soviets have been 
improving relations with tehran 
belonogov said his government favors more time for diplomacy 
before imposing a weapons ban against iran or iraq 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman on 
monday urged the council to act quickly on an arms embargo 
resolution 
iran meanwhile demanded that the council condemn iraq for 
starting the deadly war of the cities now in its second week 
both sides claim the strikes on tehran and baghdad are defensive 
and retaliatory both are believed to be using sovietmade missiles 
in the missile attacks the most intense in the 7yearold war 
as the council met behind closed doors to discuss the missile 
strikes irans attempt to stave off an embargo with an ambiguous 
note to the council appeared to have failed 
the undated unsigned scrap of paper does not constitute a 
clear acceptance of security council resolution 598 british 
ambassador sir crispin tickell said monday if they accept they 
should say so loudly clearly and unequivocally 
redman said the united states sees nothing new in the 
nonpaper and very much doubts that anyone else does either 
he told reporters that in pursuing the arms embargo we are 
continuing active consultations with other council members to 
achieve consensus on this resolution which we are convinced would 
help bring the gulf war to an end the unsigned note handed by 
irans un envoy to the security council president last week 
claims a feb 28 letter from iranian foreign minister ali albar 
velayati constituted acceptance of the councils ceasefire 
resolution 
the letter however did not say iran endorsed the resolution 
we also note that several iranian spokesmen have issued 
statements over the past few days disavowing the nonpaper released 
in new york redman noted 
the agreement of all five permanent council members the united 
states the soviet union china britain and france is needed to 
pass an arms embargo resolution each has a veto washington has 
said the stumbling block is the soviet union 
redman said secretary of state george shultz would probably 
raise the issue in talks with foreign minister wu xueqian of china 
this week 
the soviets are close allies of iraq but have also been trying 
to improve relations with neighboring iran 
crowds in tehran angered at being the target of sovietmade 
missiles tried to storm the soviet embassy over the weekend 
belonogov denied that the defensive weapons now used against 
tehran and other cities are sovietmade 
he also urged iran and iraq to stop the attacks and described 
the escalation in the war of the cities as a major development in 
the gulf conflict 
we consider this as just not another espisode in the war 
we think that the war between cities adds some new dimension to the 
protracted military conflict between the two neighboring 
countries he said 
belonogov said he met monday with secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar and with the president of the security council this 
month yugoslav ambassador dragoslav pejic and urged them in the 
most energetic terms to try to persuade iran and iraq to stop the 
missile attacks 
the position of my country is clear we are for the soonest 
possible political resolution of the war conflict between iran and 
iraq and for the speediest possible implementation of the security 
council resolution 598

a group of us 
representatives sent a scathing letter to president pw botha to 
express outrage and dismay over the slaying of a black activist 
seven us senators signed a similar letter to piet koornhof 
south africas ambassador to the united states that also protested 
the jan 24 slaying of godfry sicelo dhlomo 18 
dhlomo an antiapartheid activist was killed four days after 
police questioned him about his appearance in foreign television 
documentaries including a cbs documentary children of 
apartheid 
we the undersigned members of the us congress are writing to 
express our outrage and dismay at the assassination of godfrey 
sicelo dhlomo said the letter signed by 31 house members and 
obtained by the associated press on monday 
he is one of more than two dozen antiapartheid activists 
killed in mysterious circumstances since 1980 it said none of 
these killings have been solved by the police lending allegations 
of official involvement greater credibility 
physical evidence attests to the fact that mr dhlomo was 
beaten and tortured and it is common knowledge that intimidation 
and threats are everyday tools of the south african security police 
a south africa in flames will be the inevitable result of your 
governments failure to reform security police tactics and work 
toward a democratic society we strongly urge a prompt and thorough 
investigation into mr dhlomos death and other apartheidrelated 
crimes 
some of the house members who signed the feb 11 letter will 
participate in hearings on south africa beginning march 15 the 
letter to botha was initiated by cardiss collins dill 
police arrested dhlomo during a raid on the johannesburg offices 
of a civil rights organization on jan 20 and questioned him about 
his statements in several foreign news films 
after his body was found near his parents home in soweto 
several antiapartheid groups said they suspected police 
involvement the police have denied involvement and have offered a 
2500 reward for the arrest of the killer or killers 
the letter signed by the senate members written by sen barbara 
a mikulski dmd said we have a very strong interest in 
sicelo and require your government to allow an independent body to 
investigate the circumstances under which he was murdered 
the house letter addressed botha as prime minister a post he 
has not held since 1984 when he became president under a new 
constitution

britain began a 25day military exercise monday to 
test its ability to protect the falkland islands from invasion the 
defense ministry reported argentina said its forces would be on 
defensive alert 
at this stage its very much a paper exercise a ministry 
spokesman said the exercise will start with intelligence reports 
that an enemy is raising the threat level they will play out a 
scenario 
an infantry batallion of 6001000 soldiers based in britain 
will fly to the south atlantic archipelago march 1718 the 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
argentina claims the islands off its coast which it calls the 
malvinas and invaded them in april 1982 britain sent a naval task 
force and won a 74day war that killed 712 argentines and 258 
britons 
britain says the exercise called fire focus is purely 
defensive one of its functions will be to test a new 690 million 
airport built since the war 
ian stewart the armed forces minister said criticism of the 
exercise from argentina and other latin american nations resulted 
from misunderstanding of its size 
i do not see how something which is purely a defensive 
exercise can be seen as provocative he said 
we have to defend the falklands we had a very unfortunate 
experience six years ago we not only have a right to have a 
defensive garrison in the falklands we have a responsibility to do 
so 
the exercise scheduled to end march 31 is the largest since 
the war and the first with reinforcements flown from britain 
military units could not be airlifted in 1982 because the airport 
was inadequate and the naval force took weeks to reach the islands 
argentina says the islands are part of its inheritance from 
spanish colonial rule and claims britain stole them in 1833 
britain has refused to discuss sovereignty declaring that the 
1900 falkland islanders prefer to remain british but stewart 
said in other respects we would like to have more normal 
relations with argentina

democrats richard gephardt and albert gore jr 
are in a battle of their own in tuesdays southern primaries 
competing for the same voters and harboring hopes of knocking each 
other out of the presidential race 
with jesse jackson poised to collect the souths considerable 
black vote and michael dukakis scoring with southern liberals 
gephardt and gore are both vying for whats left the moderate and 
conservative bluecollar and middleincome white voters 
acknowledging dukakis may do very well tuesday each would like 
to emerge as the white alternative to the massachusetts governor 
and each would like to move on to the next round of contests 
without the other trying to draw a bead on dukakis 
both gore and gephardt have scaled back southern expectations as 
their initial strategies have not been fulfilled 
gephardt concentrated on the early iowa contest hoping it would 
propel him but his victory there hasnt provided momentum in the 
south gore played on regional appeal but that hasnt been enough 
in a field fractured by so many candidates 
the result each needs to beat the other to continue 
there are two gs in this race and only one g is going north 
said one source close to gores campaign insisting on anonymity 
gephardts tough foreign traderetaliation message and the 
powerful television commercials that helped him in south dakota and 
iowa have been overwhelmed by the enormity of campaigning in the 20 
states of super tuesday 
he has spent about 12 million on television and has been 
outspent threetoone by both gore and dukakis 
gore has been pummeling gephardt in tough negative television 
commercials that the gephardt campaign acknowledges has been 
effective against their candidate gore has branded gephardt a 
phony flipflopper 
dukakis also has slammed gephardt with television ads that 
depict him as a flipflopper on issues 
we have been pinned down in a very tough negative crossfire 
between dukakis and gore said gephardt polltaker ed reilly 
they have gone to any areas we have strengths especially gore 
and just beat the out of us thats effective but i think 
the net effect is going to be to drive voter turnout down very 
very low 
gore has run ads attacking dukakis and jackson too but the 
main focus of the television attack has been on gephardt 
ideally for the gore campaign we would like to and we 
expect to narrow the field by eliminating dick gephardt thereby 
creating a situation where senator gore can focus clearly on 
michael dukakis and jesse jackson said gore spokesman arlie 
schardt 
an abc news poll of the south released monday night said that 
the biggest loser on super tuesday will probably be richard 
gephardt who is leading only in his home state of missouri and 
could drop below the 15 percent threshold for delegates in 12 of 
16 states polled 
both gore and gephardt are focusing on the delegate count coming 
out of super tuesday rather than the number of states won neither 
predicts an outright win in the biggest states of florida and 
texas but they hope to collect a big share of delegates there 
gore forces believe if they can push gephardt into a 
fourthplace finish in delegates and hold him to winning little 
more than his home state of missouri he will be staggered and 
unable to continue gephardt forces scoff at that notion 
theyre not going to knock us out said reilly no way 
its absurd 
but both gephardt and gore face the prospect of leaving the 
south impoverished and facing in dukakis if he wins florida and 
texas a candidate who has demonstrated national appeal 
gore took out a 1 million line of credit to saturate southern 
television gephardt faced a financial squeeze going into the south 
that limited his ability to run the ads that proved effective 
elsewhere including his vow that unless south korea opened its 
markets hed put so many taxes on their products a hyundai 
automobile would cost 48000 
noting that ad dukakis spokesman leslie dach said the 
hyundai may very well run out of gas on tuesday night

gallaudet university students vowed monday to 
keep their campus closed indefinitely after the schools board of 
trustees reaffirmed its selection of a hearing presdent to head the 
nations only liberal arts university for the deaf 
were going to keep the school closed said student leader 
jerry covell we will stop when we get a deaf president 
covell and around 1800 of the schools 2200 students protested 
at the capitol after board of trustees chairman jane basset spilman 
told the students the board would not reconsider its decision to 
hire elizabeth ann zinser as gallaudets next president 
the selection of zinser an administrator at the university of 
north carolina at greensboro was the product of a careful 
reasoned search process spilman said 
a lawful proper and final decision was made she said 
as spilman made her announcement in the schools field house 
students listening there spilled out into the street and began a 
onemile walk to the capitol 
spilman and several other board members listened for about 30 
minutes to complaints from the 100 or so students then left 
without speaking to reporters 
gallaudet the nations only liberal arts college for the deaf 
was created by an act of congress in 1864 and relies on federal 
funding for most of its operating budget in fiscal year 1988 
gallaudet received 62 million from congress 
were trying to put some pressure on congress to get them to 
put some pressure on our board said covell a 23yearold 
frederick md resident after this well march to the white 
house 
mondays protest capped a week of demonstrations in which 
students tried to convince the board of trustees to hire a deaf 
person as the schools seventh president 
after spilman announced sunday that zinser had won out over two 
deaf finalists students walked to the hotel where the board was 
meeting then continued their protest at the capitol monday 
students gathered before dawn and blocked all entrances to the 
campus forcing officials to cancel classes for the day 
a committee of 10 students two faculty members and two staff 
members told the trustees that they wanted zinser replaced with a 
deaf president the resignation of spilman and assurances that 
deaf people would constitute a majority of the schools 20member 
board within three years 
the student group and the trustees met for around three hours on 
the northeast washington campus before spilman announced that the 
decision made the day before would stand 
i do not think i will ever experience a more frustrating 
feeling in my life said frank r turk the schools dean of 
student life who is deaf i have been on the gallaudet payroll 
for 35 years and i have never felt so defeated 
spilman said zinser was selected because she is a top caliber 
academician who also has the administrative and fundraising 
skills the school was looking for 
deaf students claim that only a deaf person can truly understand 
their educational needs 
zinser said she understood the students frustration 
i feel considerable empathy and compassion for the students 
zinser said by telephone from her greensboro office i hope to 
speak with them soon but given the intensity of this situation 
its only right for me to maintain some distance 
students had expressed outrage that zinser does not speak sign 
language but the incoming president vowed to accelerate 
immediately her study of the language 
i have a facility for learning it and now that i have been 
hired i plan to have an intensive training program 
spilman said that zinser was selected bu a 104 margin with the 
three deaf members and one hearing member of the trustees 
selection committee voting for one of the two deaf candidates 
philip w bravin a deaf trustee who headed the search 
committee said he and the committees other deaf members lobbied 
to no avail for a deaf president 
your expressions outline exactly what we put on the table 
bravin an ibm executive told the students who remained on campus 
after spilmans announcement we did the best we could do 
bravin asserted that the two other finalists for the post i 
king jordan gallaudets dean of the college of arts and sciences 
and harvey j corson superintendent of the louisiana school for 
the deaf in baton rouge la both were qualified to be 
gallaudets next president 
no candidate has the perfect criteria and they both were 
qualified i think the committees decision speaks for itself

jury selection began monday in a 
trial of a taiwanese gangster accused of killing a chineseamerican 
journalist openly critical of the taiwanese government 
tung kueisen has pleaded innocent in the 1984 shooting of henry 
liu at the writers daly city home 
the plea puzzled his attorney since the 35yearold tung 
testified two years ago in a new york drug trial that he and a 
fellow member of taiwans largest criminal syndicate the united 
bamboo gang gunned down liu on government orders relayed by gang 
chief chen chili 
i suspect he just wants to tell the jury and everyone else his 
story said defense attorney douglas gray he thought he was 
doing his governments bidding and he was left twisting slowly 
slowly in the wind 
prosecutor robert bishop said he expects the trial before san 
mateo county superior court judge margaret kemp to last two weeks 
and he will call up to 18 witnesses gray said he was unsure how he 
would present his case 
tung faces one count of murder and one special allegation that 
he used a gun in the oct 15 1984 slaying if convicted he could 
face 27 years to life in prison 
tung was convicted of heroin smuggling after a federal trial in 
new york in 1986 and was sentenced to 20 years in prison 
liu a longterm critic of the taiwanese government was a 
columnist for a chineselanguage newspaper in san francisco and had 
just published a book that attacked the island nations ruling 
party when he was killed 
the us congress and the state department condemned lius 
murder and house hearings were held to look into the murky 
circumstances surrounding it 
chen has blamed the killing on taiwans former chief of military 
intelligence vice admiral wang shiling who said he only directed 
that liu be taught a lesson 
both chen and wang are serving life sentences in taiwan after 
being convicted in the killing in a taiwanese military court two 
intelligence officials who served under wang are serving lesser 
terms 
wu tun 35 the second gunman is serving a life term for the 
killing in a taiwan prison

us department of agriculture investigators arrived in 
mansfield on monday to look into the attack police capt john 
arcudi said owners of exotic animals must register with the

the man whose attempted murder conviction 
led to the book and television movie deadly intentions was 
sentenced to 15 years in prison monday on federal marijuana and 
weapons charges 
the sentence was handed down after a prosecutor alleged that the 
defendant former doctor patrick henry planned to use blood serum 
containing the aids virus in a revenge scheme and planned to kill a 
former federal prosecutor 
us district judge emmett cox imposed the sentence and ordered 
henry sent to a prison where he could receive psychiatric treatment 
in an appeal for mercy henry 40 said he got discouraged 
in prison after his 1979 conviction and picked up some bad 
attitudes while in prison henry wrote the outlaws bible 
under the pen name ex boozhie prosecutors said the book 
instructs readers on how to avoid arrest 
henry served 6 years of a 15year sentence in an arizona prison 
for the attempted murder of his first wife christine he moved to 
mobile in an attempt to regain his medical license 
judge i dont know if you believe a man can change henry 
said im going to do my best 
his current wife nancy turned to authorities when she 
discovered an ammunition box concealed in their home that contained 
an assortment of materials including manuals on explosives and 
false identities 
henry was convicted jan 21 of possessing a pistol after being 
convicted of a felony and scheming to distribute marijuana to 
prisoners in arizona where he had served time 
us attorney jeff sessions told the judge monday that henry 
planned to use the pistol and a bomb to blow up the us 
attorneys office in tucson neither the pistol nor the bomb were 
introduced as evidence in the trial 
sessions said the ammunition box also contained two vials of 
blood serum containing the aids virus he said the virus was 
confirmed by testing at the department of defense laboratory in 
washington 
fbi spokesman gene eason said authorities could only surmise how 
henry planned to use the aids virus he said the serum apparently 
was collected while henry worked at a mobile doctors office while 
attempting to recover his professional license as a dermatologist 
my view is simply this the evidence indicates very strongly 
this defendant would like to pose a danger to the witnesses in this 
trial and the trial 10 years ago sessions said 
defense attorney jim byrd told the judge the government had 
pursued henry because of a spiteful neurotic suicidal wife who 
lied during his trial 
pats life has been dissected by the fbi and agents of the 
us government byrd said he said henry had a constitutional 
right to possess books on bombs marijuana growing scorpions and 
identity manuals 
there was never any threat of blowing up the us attorneys 
office or any other target byrd said pat is an electronics 
hobbyist none of these materials pertained to a detonating 
device 
byrd said sessions version of the case was fantasies of a 
suspicious mind 
sessions argued that henry planned to return to arizona and kill 
former us attorney randy stevens who cowrote the book deadly 
intentions 
the movie starred michael biehn as a promising young physician 
who terrorized his wife after his violent schizophrenic 
personality emerged he was arrested for plotting to kill his wife 
after she divorced him 
a photograph of stevens also was in henrys ammo box sessions 
said

the breast of chicken was cooked to perfection 
and the trappings in the state departments elegant eighthfloor 
dining room reflected painstaking effort 
all seemed in order monday when secretary of state george p 
shultz hosted a luncheon for chinese foreign minister wu xueqian 
except for one apparent gaffe in protocol the silverware was from 
taiwan 
there was no indication that wu or any member of his delegation 
noted the word taiwan etched on the bottom of the utensils 
the claim of the taiwanese government to be the official 
representative of the chinese people has been a sore point with the 
mainland for almost four decades 
the lapse evoked memories a similar mishap in 1975 when 
president gerald r ford on a visit to beijing hosted a dinner 
for chinese officials at the us diplomatic mission in china 
the chop sticks were from taiwan

a federal judge on monday cleared the way for 
the regional bell telephone companies to offer certain new 
computerized information services including voice storage and 
electronic mail 
but us district judge harold greene in a 66page decision 
refused to retreat from an earlier decision in which he said phone 
companies could transmit information but could not generate or 
manipulate the content of the information 
it is the courts expectation that this easing of the 
information services restriction will avoid anticompetitive 
effects and that it will at the same time bring this nation closer 
to the enjoyment of the full benefits of the information age 
greene said in his decision 
though greenes decision lifts the legal barrier to the bell 
companies offering of the new services the companies still would 
need state and federal regulatory approval before they could 
integrate them into their networks 
industry experts and bell company officials say the computer 
software for these services has been developed and could be offered 
to consumers in some parts of the country within one to two years 
voice storage and retrieval services would allow consumers to 
rely on the phone network for storing and retrieving messages 
functions now performed by telephone answering machines electronic 
mail a service now available in many private phone systems allows 
the computertocomputer transfer of messages 
in addition greene said the bell companies can perform certain 
computerized gateway services such as data transmission 
billing management and services that enable different computers to 
speak to each other 
bellsouth and bell atlantic said the decision was an important 
step toward making a wide range of information services available 
to american consumers but both said the judge did not go far 
enough and bell atlantic said it will appeal the decision 
we view this as a start but only a start we still are not 
allowed to provide content for information services a bellsouth 
statement said 
bell atlantic chairman thomas e bolger said the company is 
particularly concerned that greene is continuing to forbid the 
bell companies from electronic publishing of yellow page phone 
directories greenes september ruling allowed electronic white 
pages but bolger said the courts restrictions do not allow a 
sufficiently flexible and comprehensive electronic service for 
white pages directory 
he also said greenes decision to continue to forbid the bell 
companies from getting into the content side of information 
services will delay the delivery of more sophisticated services 
like home banking and shopping to most american consumers 
joel gross a telephone analyst with donaldson lufkin amp 
jenrette said the decision was a major breakthrough for the 
regional phone companies he said that in the long term it will 
be a tremendous boon to the industry though in the shortterm 
will have little effect on the companies earninings 
services like this since they are softwarebased should be 
highprofit services and voice storage and retrieval will create 
new traffic volumes for the phone networks he said 
gene kimmelman a spokesman for the consumer federation of 
america said the decision means regulation of the industry will 
become more important to prevent the bell companies from 
overpricing local phone service to finance these new services 
greene who oversees the antitrust decree that broke up the 
american telephone amp telegraph co four years ago has been 
reluctant to allow atampts offspring the bell companies to compete 
in areas where their control of the local phone networks would put 
them at an advantage over competitors 
last september he refused to lift prohibitions on the baby 
bells that prevent them from making phone equipment or offering 
longdistance services in considering the restrictions on 
information services however he opened the door slightly 
mondays ruling details the informationservices options now open 
to the bell companies

jesse jackson said monday hes going into the 
super tuesday elections as an underdog but thinks hell do very 
well nonetheless 
i dont have a crystal ball he said when asked how many 
delegates he might pick up in the days balloting 
jackson pointed to the hightech wellfinanced operation of 
democratic presidential rival michael dukakis 
he has money i have the message and the grassroots approach 
it will be interesting to see how these concepts play out he 
said 
jackson made the comments in an interviw aboard his campaign 
plane flying from an airport rally in laredo to a rally at the 
university of houston 
as he campaigned on the eve of super tuesday jackson said texas 
has shaped up to a fight between himself and dukakis he also 
contended his message has become part of the political mainstream 
when one takes a serious look at my positions they are very 
central to the broadbased american point of view he said 
earlier jackson visited an aids clinic in dallas and told a 
rally in brownsville ill be your friend in washington 
jackson pledged to fight against proposals to make english the 
official language of the united states 
we are a great nation we can speak more than one language 
twothirds of the hemisphere speaks spanish we should grow and 
speak more languages have broader culture he said 
jackson donned a sombrero and the popular latinstyle shirt 
called a guayaberra as he addressed the mixedrace outdoor 
gathering where several people waved red united farm worker flags 
jackson recalled his visit to brownsville of several weeks ago 
when he went into the broccoli fields where there are no portable 
lavatories for the field workers 
ufw organizer juanita valdez said that jackson should get a lot 
of farm worker support because he came to help us 
after jacksons visit she said the state health director 
called a meeting to find out why the sanitary laws were not being 
enforced in the field 
you need a friend in the white house jackson said im 
your friend in brownsville ill be your friend in washington 
jackson was accompanied by former new mexico gov toney anaya 
who addressed the gathering in spanish texas agriculture 
commissioner jim hightower prominent feminist leader sissy 
farenthold and tennessee politician john j hooker 
one man in the crowd carlos martinez said he was supporting 
jackson because jackson cares about the mexicanamerican problems 
and the poor people martinez said the oncebustling port of 
brownsville is dead and that he had been laid off a few years 
back from both marathon and pyramid oil companies 
were just about forgotten about down here and the economy is 
really bad were looking for a change he said 
hightower said the southern region is the secondmost depressed 
part of texas after laredo where jackson headed later in the day 
earlier he visited with dying men in an aids clinic in dallas 
several onlookers said that jackson and democratic rival michael 
dukakis will likely split the democratic vote in this area 
dukakis who speaks fluent spanish has been pushing hard for the 
hispanic vote and visited neighboring harlingen a week ago 
but county commissioner candidate gilberto villarreal a jackson 
supporter said speaking spanish or marrying a hispanic does not 
give you the heart of a hispanic he said that while dukakis has 
done tremendous work in massachusetts jackson has the heart of 
a hispanic he came up from the grass roots he has not forgotten 
what it is to be poor he said

arizonas top police official testified at 
gov evan mechams impeachment trial monday that he realized almost 
immediately mecham had committed a crime in ordering the official 
to not cooperate in an investigation of an alleged death threat 
i was in shock over what he was saying taken aback 
speechless said col ralph milstead director of the state 
department of public safety 
milstead quoted mecham as angrily telling him i dont want 
you to help the attorney general hang me dont tell him anything 
milstead said he had phoned the governor nov 15 to discuss a 
report that lee watkins then a mecham administration official had 
threatened to send a former mecham aide on a long boat ride if 
she didnt stop testifying before a grand jury investigating mecham 
campaign finances 
watkins has denied threatening the aide donna carlson and 
milstead has said he cooperated with the attorney generals office 
milstead whose testimony is crucial to the obstruction of 
justice charge against the governor blurted out his statement 
regarding a crime during crossexamination by mechams attorney 
fred craft 
craft asked why milstead in his report on the incident quoted 
the governors words but not milsteads own part of the 
conversation 
because im not committing a crime said milstead im 
not obstructing justice 
when did you conclude that the governors words constituted a 
crime asked craft 
as im hearing them and reflecting on them said milstead 
adding it took him about two seconds after hanging up the phone 
craft asked milstead why he did not write down his conclusion 
that a crime had been committed 
i didnt think it was necessary said milstead anyone 
with a legal background could read it and see this was an 
obstruction of an investigation 
craft kept milstead on crossexamination for most of the day and 
said he would continue quizzing him tuesday senate democratic 
minority leader alan stephens told reporters the senators were 
growing restless and had requested that craft be asked to conclude 
its difficult for us to listen to what many of us consider 
repetitious quetions he said if thats what they do in a 
court of law im glad im not a lawyer 
at one point craft asked if milstead was surprised that his 
staff didnt tell him the governor had assigned a member of his 
cabinet max hawkins to investigate the death threat allegation 
no it didnt surprise me said milstead max hawkins is 
not a law enforcement officer hes not competent to investigate 
it lee watkins works for him and max hawkins wouldnt be taken 
seriously anywhere on earth that i know of 
hawkins former head of the department of administration was 
fired last week by acting gov rose mofford who said he had 
publicly attacked government officials 
milstead the trials seventh witness took the stand at the 
start of the second week of testimony mecham the first us 
governor to face an impeachment trial in six decades has not 
attended the proceedings yet 
mecham 63 a firstterm republican is accused in the 
impeachment proceedings of obstructing the attorney generals 
investigation of the alleged death threat through his orders to 
milstead 
mecham in testimony before a house impeachment committee in 
january acknowledged that he may have told milstead not to 
cooperate with the investigation however mecham contended he was 
not fully informed about the seriousness of the situation before 
his conversation with milstead 
the governor also is accused in 23 articles of impeachment of 
concealing a 350000 campaign loan and misusing 80000 in a state 
fund by loaning it to his auto dealership 
mecham also faces a recall election may 17 and a criminal trial 
march 22 on felony charges accusing him of concealing the 350000 
loan 
milstead described a tense angry fearful mecham trying to 
minimize the alleged threat 
he said this was a family spat and theres nothing to it 
milstead testified 
milstead said he had called the governor as a courtesy to tell 
him he was taking the matter to the attorney general and was 
surprised by mechams anger 
his reaction was well if you want my permission to talk to 
the attorney general you cant have it the answer is no 
at one point milstead said he was kind of pleading and told 
mecham we always cooperate with the attorney general 
he said never dont give them any help 
earlier in the day attorney general robert corbin advised the 
senate not to grant immunity to watkins who invoked fifth 
amendment protection against selfincrimination friday and refused 
to testify 
corbin confirmed that watkins is the target of a grand jury 
investigation and said it would be inappropriate to immunize him 
from possible future prosecution 
impeachment trial prosecutor william french said we would be 
against giving the likes of mr watkins a bath for all the sins he 
has committed 
the senators were unanimous in their rejection of immunity 
a twothirds vote of the 30member senate is required to convict 
mecham the senators then could take another vote and bar him from 
holding state office again

cardinal miguel obando y bravo and the 
secretarygeneral of the organization of american states agreed to 
be witnesses at talks between the government and contra rebels a 
presidential communique said monday 
the agreement by joao baena soares the oas official and obando 
y bravo roman catholic archbishop of managua appeared to ease the 
way for truce negotiations starting wednesday in sapoa on the 
border with costa rica about 90 miles from managua 
president daniel ortega last week said the cardinal was no 
longer needed as a mediator in talks with the usbacked rebels 
obando y bravo had served as a gobetween since last november at 
government request 
the contras insisted the cardinal be a witness and the talks 
had appeared to be in jeopardy 
ortega sent letters this week to obando y bravo and baena soares 
asking them to serve as witnesses the governments voice of 
nicaragua radio said monday 
no one answered the telephone at the headquarters of the 
washingtonbased oas 
contra leader adolfo calero earlier monday accused the 
government of preparing a unilateral show rather than planning 
for the talks 
in a telephone interview from miami calero complained that the 
leftist sandinistas had not responded to a contra demand that 
obando y bravo be present as witness moderator and guarantor of 
the talks 
ortega said last week that the three days of talks would be 
headed by his brother humberto ortega the defense minister and 
one of nine members on the ruling national directorate acceding to 
a contra demand he said the talks would be held in nicaragua and 
suggested the sapoa site 
the contras accepted and named calero to head their delegation 
but said the cardinal must attend 
calero said the contras received no word from the government 
about security arrangements or the agenda 
the government says the talks should center on laying down arms 
as outlined in the regional peace plan signed last august by the 
presidents of nicaragua el salvador guatemala costa rica and 
honduras 
the rebels want a proposal outlined by the cardinal last month 
to be included 
his agenda called for the government to grant total amnesty to 
political prisoners review a mandatory military draft law allow 
full press freedom and renew a dialogue with its internal 
opposition in return contras were to accept a 30day ceasefire 
we havent received any response to our position of last 
thursday which included these items calero said 
we said clearly then that we accept the highlevel meeting to 
discuss the cardinals agenda and that we had agreed with the 
preliminary details of the meeting but we havent had a response 
from the sandinista government he said

an attorney experienced at representing the 
families of deceased astronauts said the settlement negotiated by 
the government for four challenger families was woefully 
inadequate 
ronald d krist a houston attorney who represented astronauts 
survivors from the apollo fire in 1967 as well as three families 
from the 1986 space shuttle disaster said the four challenger 
families should have received more money and would have if they had 
had formal legal representation 
the families according to documents released monday are 
dividing the proceeds from annuities and lump sums that cost a 
total of 7735 million payments from the annuities will be 
extended over years and may amount to much more than the actual 
cost the settlement was negotiated for the families by the 
department of justice morton thiokol inc manufacturer of the 
rocket blamed for the challenger accident paid 60 percent of the 
settlement and the us government paid the rest 
if theyre happy im happy for them krist said of the four 
families that settled without filing lawsuits but i would never 
have put my stamp of approval for a settlement at the level that 
they received 
they would have netted more money if they had been adequately 
represented krist added 
challenger exploded on jan 28 1986 just 73 seconds after it 
was launched from the kennedy space center in florida seven 
astronauts including new hampshire school teacher christa 
mcauliffe died in the accident 
mcauliffes husband along with the wives of challenger 
commander dick scobee mission specialist ellison onizuka and 
engineer bruce jarvis all settled through the justice department 
negotiations 
however the widow of mission specialist ron mcnair the father 
of jarvis and the mother of mission specialist judy resnik all 
hired krist to file separate suits only against thiokol the suits 
were settled out of court but krist said he was under court order 
to not discuss how much was paid 
but he was blunt about the governmentnegotiated settlement 
that settlement is woefully inadequate he said im 
suggesting that if i was representing them i would not have 
allowed any of them to settle for the amount they received of less 
than 2 million a piece per family 
however betty grissom whose husband gus died in an apollo 
spacecraft fire in 1967 said it sounds like they did ok 
mrs grissom said she received only 350000 and she had to sue 
on her own for that the government she said didnt care and 
never attempted to help her or the widows of two other astronauts 
who died in the apollo fire 
i never heard from the justice department she said i 
thought we got an injustice done to us i feel like we got taken 
they act like they care now but they didnt back then 
it kinda hurts she added it stings that we never got 
treated like that it hurts when i think that theyre getting that 
much money 
michael d oldak a washington lawyer and exhusband of 
astronaut judith a resnik said the documents confirm for him that 
resnik family was treated unfairly by the government in settlement 
negotiations 
resniks father marvin and her estate were initially involved 
in settlement negotiations with the government said oldak who 
represented the resniks 
he said the government made two offers but neither were 
accepted oldak said that because resnik was single and childless 
and because the governments compensation formula was weighted 
heavily toward surviving spouses and children the offer to 
resniks survivors was a quarter to a half of what they were 
offering the other families 
the government has declined to contribute anything to any of the 
families outside the four it negotiated settlements with 
justice spokeswoman amy brown said the government had made 
settlement offers to attorneys for the resniks smiths and mcnairs 
based on the same formula used for the other families these were 
rejected she said 
after the rejections the families either negotiated directly 
with morton thiokol or filed suits or claims against the company 
or the government miss brown said the government would not 
negotiate further with the three nonsettling families because it 
would not enter a settlement separate from one with morton thiokol 
or which exceeded the guidelines used in the other settlements 
judy resniks father and her estate recently settled privately 
with morton thiokol for a sum that marvin resnik said it was 
between 2 million and 35 million 
oldak declined to confirm the amount but he said in 
hindsight it was a good decision not to be part of the 
governmentnegotiated settlement 
one lawsuit filed by jane smith widow of challenger pilot 
michael smith remains to be settled mrs smith did not 
participate in the governmentnegotiated settlement and a court 
ruled she could not sue the government but she is suing thiokol 
mrs smith declined to come to the telephone when her houston 
home was called on monday

the judicial misconduct hearing of a former 
vermont supreme court justice began with a delay monday as 
attorneys for a key figure in the case argued she should not have 
to testify 
attorneys for former chittenden county assistant judge jane 
wheel told the judicial conduct board that her criminal case would 
be damaged if she testified in the separate case of her friend and 
former coworker justice william hill 
hill was one of three supreme court justices accused of allowing 
their personal relationships with wheel to interfere with their 
judicial duties 
the charges filed in january 1987 by the state judicial conduct 
board named hill thomas hayes and ernest gibson iii hill has 
retired since the charges were filed hayes has died and the 
charges against gibson were dropped and he remains on the court 
the scandal threw the states highest court into turmoil the 
justices refused gov madeleine kunins request that they step 
aside but they did disqualify themselves from all cases involving 
people connected with the case 
the complaint alleged that the three used their clout to help 
wheel whether it was in minor matters like writing memos 
endorsing suggestions she made or major matters like advising her 
while she was under criminal investigation by the state attorney 
generals office for allegedly padding her paycheck 
wheel was convicted on three counts of false swearing during a 
jury trial last month she was accused of lying during an inquest 
into allegations that she submitted false pay vouchers 
wheel appeared in court briefly monday but she left after she 
and her attorneys were given one day to submit memoranda on why she 
shouldnt have to testify 
hills attorney michael marks had said he and his client 
welcomed the misconduct hearing calling it hills opportunity to 
defend himself publicly 
but most of the first days testimony centered on wheel and her 
activities as an assistant judge 
in hills written responses to the boards original charges he 
said his relationship with wheel was strictly professional and did 
not go beyond the amicable relationship expected of judges who 
work together 
but the state on monday attempted to depict a much closer 
relationship between the two 
court reporter joan giard described a gathering she attended at 
the holiday inn in waterbury wheel arrived with hill on one arm 
and hayes on the other 
she danced with justice hill that evening giard said i 
remember looking over 
marks objected to much of the testimony about wheel and her 
criminal case but was overruled by harvey otterman the chairman 
of the threemember hearing panel 
the retirement of hill 60 from the high court leaves few 
options for punishment if he is found guilty of judicial 
misconduct he could be reprimanded or perhaps restricted from 
serving on the court under a law that allows retired justices to 
sit on certain cases

dont let them tell you this is a 
television campaign massachusetts gov michael s dukakis said 
monday as he raced through a final day of presuper tuesday 
campaigning 
still dukakis packed 21 television interviews into his final 
day of stumping before tuesdays primaries and caucuses in 20 
states including 14 southern and border states 
he campaigned in person monday in miami and the tampa area then 
traveled to an evening rally in the raleighdurham area of north 
carolina before a scheduled flight back to boston 
if we can emerge from super tuesday with the lead in terms of 
delegates well be on our way to the nomination he said 
dukakis kicked off the day of campaigning in miami perhaps his 
most solid base of support in the south 
at a senior citizens rally dukakis picked up the valued 
endorsement of 74yearold annie ackerman who has a reputation in 
miami for being able to get out the vote 
you have come out to listen to the man who will be the next 
president of the united states ackerman said she spoke of 
dukakis immigrant roots something he had in common with many of 
those at the rally 
my mother would have said hes a mensch she said referring 
to the yiddish word for good man hes a person of integrity who 
gets things done 
ackerman a former ward organizer for the late chicago mayor 
richard daley met with several of the presidential candidates but 
decided on dukakis after a straw poll of the residents of her 
condominium complex 
dukakis traveled from miami to plant city to attend a strawberry 
festival and also marched in a parade with florida attorney general 
robert butterworth at his side on monday 
he planned to vote in his hometown of brookline mass tuesday 
morning spend the day at his statehouse office and then fly to 
chicago to begin campaigning for the illinois primary 
throughout his southern campaign swing nearly all of dukakis 
stops have come in areas where he is expected to win the strategy 
seems to be to reinforce areas of strength rather than seek new 
support 
there are only so many hours in a day you cant go 
everywhere the massachusetts governor has repeatedly said 
asked whether the super tuesday primaries were a flop in 
attracting moderate and conservative democrats dukakis said 
its not been a flop for mike dukakis i dont understand what 
the labels mean 
dukakis has not talked much about his opponents he has 
continued to criticize missouri rep richard gephardt seen by many 
as his principal rival but such comments have only come with 
prompting from reporters 
he said he is worried that the negative campaigning between him 
and gephardt is hurting the chances for the democratic party in 
november in response to a barb from gephardt criticizing the 
dukakis attacks he said no i dont think ive impugned his 
integrity 
meanwhile in boston 20 protesters were arrested outside 
dukakis statehouse office on trespassing charges as they staged a 
sitin to demand an immediate increase in welfare benefits 
most of the protesters went limp when told to leave the 
building so police had to lift them into nearby elevators 
while hes out stumping our kids are starving one 
protester shouted

vice president george bush said monday the 
person that clearly wins super tuesday is going to be the nominee 
of the party as he coasted on polls that gave him a big lead in 
most of the 17 gop contests 
bush stopped short of forecasting a sweep on tuesday 
you always wish for that but i certainly would never predict 
that its too much for anyone to expect he said earlier in the 
day 
at his last public appearance of the day in rogers ark the 
vice president said he was optimistic but not overconfident 
asked what hed do if he didnt win super tuesday he replied 
ill have to do what i did when i got kicked in iowa get up off 
the canvas go out and fight hard after his thirdplace finish 
in iowa bush went on to a solid win in the new hampshire primary 
eight days later 
in a twohour stop at tulsa international airport he told a 
rally that super tuesday constitutes the most historic political 
event in modern political history 
its critical he said the person that clearly wins super 
tuesday is going to be the nominee of the party and i think the 
next president 
bush introduced by gov henry bellmon at the rally later 
toured the american airlines maintenance and engineering facility 
at the airport and took a moment to turn a wrench on an engine 
bush appeared tired at a 15minute news conference following a 
brisk walking tour of the sprawling facility 
the vice president dismissed the possibility of a brokered 
convention 
were talking about victory and hes talking about brokering 
something he said i dont see it happening i think there are 
so many events that i think the republican nominee will be 
determined before the convention 
bush was asked about negative ads that he called comparative 
spots criticizing doles record in the senate 
when attacked youll see some retaliation bush said but 
when you look at the totality and how it all came about i think 
people understand that a person has a right to in a laserlike 
fashion go after them i think actually the factual backup of 
those ads is pretty irrefutable 
bush a former oilman said he feels compatible with the base 
of this state but he said he cannot support a tax on imported 
oil as a means of shoring up the ailing domestic energy business 
i was in the oil business and i remember what it was like to 
have government controls allocations of markets and regulation 
and who hated it the worst the oil industry bush said 
that also has an artificial inflationary builtin premise to 
it everybodys costs go up its like any other tax and im 
opposed to raising taxes the industry is split on the oil import 
fee i dont happen to be in favor of it i think what i propose 
including a tax credit for exploration is the way to go

the federal government insisted monday 
that west germany had had no serious disagreements with its nato 
allies about disarmament at an alliance summit last week 
attempts to fabricate disagreements on basic questions 
between the federal republic and its allies find a basis 
neither in the proceedings nor in the results of the summit said 
a communique 
it said chancellor helmut kohl determined at the north atlantic 
treaty organization summit in brussels belgium that the alliance 
will concentrate on working out a comprehensive disarmament 
concept 
kohl assumed from the talks that work within the alliance will 
proceed smoothly and be finished at the latest within a year 
said the statement read to reporters by government spokesman 
friedhelm ost 
it also said there should not be attempts to artifically 
create pressures on nato to make a quick decision on the 
modernization of shortrange nuclear weapons 
that remark appeared to be aimed at prime minister margaret 
thatcher of britain who told the summit that the alliance would 
soon have to think seriously about modernizing its aging 
shortrange nuclear weapons 
kohl had resisted demands at the summit for a stronger nato 
position on the modernization of shortrange nuclear weapons which 
have a range of up to 300 miles 
kohl wants nato to postpone the scheduled modernization of those 
weapons and to begin negotiations with the sovietled warsaw pact 
alliance on reducing shortrange nuclear arsenals 
mondays statement repeated kohls position that he does not 
favor total removal of nuclear weapons from europe but wants a 
reduction and parity in conventional and nuclear arms by both nato 
and the warsaw pact 
bonn officials have said west germany would be the main 
battleground in a european war because it borders east germany and 
czechoslovakia

prosecutors monday sought a onemonth 
delay in gov evan mechams criminal trial for allegedly concealing 
a 350000 campaign loan while defense lawyers said the charges 
should be dismissed 
maricopa county superior court judge michael ryan said he would 
rule on the delay motion which was opposed by the defense 
wednesday or thursday he did not say when he would rule on a 
series of defense motions brought monday 
delays in pretrial procedures sought by the defense have left 
too little time for prosecutors to prepare said assistant attorney 
general barnett lotstein he sought to change the trial starting 
date from march 22 to april 21 
the governors political agenda has no place in this 
courtroom lotstein told ryan he wants a speedy trial we want 
a trial after the rules have been complied with 
defense attorney michael scott argued against a delay in the 
trial adding we want to resolve this matter and put it behind 
us 
in an indictment handed up jan 8 the governor was charged with 
six felony counts of fraud perjury and filing false documents in 
his failure to disclose a 350000 campaign loan his brother and 
1986 campaign manager willard mecham faces three similar counts 
mechams senate impeachment trial went into its second week 
monday and he also faces a may 17 recall election 
defense attorneys filed a series of motions monday seeking 
dismissal or a new determination of the charges validity on 
several grounds including a claim that people who had a definite 
stance on the mecham recall movement were unfairly excluded from 
the grand jury 
the motion said the indictments should be dismissed because 
both those who favored the recall and those who opposed the recall 
were blanketly excluded from the grand jury without any regard to 
their ability to make a fair decision 
dismissal of the charges on grounds the mechams were victims 
of selective prosecution 
the motion claimed that other public figures including state 
lawmakers such as former house majority leader burton barr and 
current house minority leader art hamilton were not prosecuted 
when it was found that they had omitted items from their financial 
disclosure statements 
not only was governor mecham not given a written opportunity 
to file an amended return his protestations of oversight and 
avowals of no criminal intent fell upon deaf ears the motion 
said why because the political turmoil surrounding his nine 
months in office threatened to destroy the power and influence the 
republican party had spent more than 20 years nurturing and 
cultivating 
a change of venue because of massive pretrial publicity and 
separate questioning of prospective jurors in an effort to see that 
they are not biased 
separate trials for evan and willard mecham who now are 
scheduled to be tried together 
ryan also took under advisement a defense motion to dismiss two 
of the counts against willard mecham and four of the counts against 
the governor the defense claimed the grand jury did not have 
jurisdiction to bring those charges

might have been significant to the defense the evidence in 
question was the bullets from a 22caliber pistol found in a black 
transam 
at one point after miss cobb disappeared on patrol officers 
issued a bulletin for a black trans am that reportedly had been 
chased by miss cobbs patrol car in dallas county

but assistant attorney general william wasden said monday that 
prosecution witnesses will show shoemaker is not involved in the

harris glenn milstead known to moviegoers as 
divine the campy 300pound transvestite star of such films as 
pink flamingos and hairspray died in his sleep in a hotel 
room the coroners office said monday he was 42 
los angeles county coroner spokesman steve stewart said 
investigators went to the regency plaza hotel on hollywood 
boulevard where milstead was a guest when he died during the 
night the cause of death is under investigation stewart said 
milstead apparently died of asphyxiation said spokesman john 
west of pmk public relations 
he was finally getting respect within the industry said 
milsteads manager bernard jay he was getting the legitimate 
screen and television offers that showed the industry had finally 
accepted him as the very good character actor he always knew he 
was 
milstead got a medical checkup last friday and was declared in 
excellent health other than his weight which has been a 
constant problem throughout his life said jay 
west said milstead star of the latest john watersdirected 
movie hairspray was in los angeles to appear in an episode of 
the fox network television series married with children 
milstead was to have appeared in that role dressed as a man but 
he was best known to movie fans as the bizarre female impersonating 
star of such cult classic films as pink flamingos lust in 
the dust polyester and female trouble 
the divine character was garishly made up and outrageously 
chesty as well as loud raucous and foulmouthed milsteads 
appearance made the first waters films a favorite for 
aftermidnight showings at arty cinema houses 
but with each film both milstead and waters found a wider 
audience and hairspray has enjoyed a good following as well as 
flattering reviews coming in no 16 this weekend in the box office 
with 577258 at 79 theaters for a 7307 per screen average 
in the film set in the early 1960s he plays the mother of a 
chubby teenage girl who becomes a teen television dance star and 
pioneer integrationist dressed as a man he also plays a 
segregationist television station manager 
in another nontransvestite role milstead played a sydney 
greenstreettype character in the 1985 film trouble in mind 
milstead said in a 1985 interview that he grew up fat and 
taunted by classmates in lutherville a suburb of baltimore the 
only son of a businessman and his wife milstead told an 
interviewer he had a fantasy life revolving around female movie 
stars and dreams of becoming a celebrity 
one of his few friends from high school was waters whose 
obsession with trashy movies nearly matched milsteads fantasies of 
celebrity waters began casting his friend in bizarre roles 
in the 1972 pink flamingos divine was introduced as the 
filthiest person alive 
the character is a real person milstead once said of 
divine sometimes shes just too bold but she has socially 
redeeming qualities no matter what she does shes her own person 
and a lot of people like that 
the camp element is something out of the ordinary this big 
man playing a sexy woman 
besides film roles milstead also used the divine persona in a 
nightclub act 
he is survived by his mother and father frances and harris 
milstead who now live in florida west said

campaign swing through missouri monday all but conceded super 
tuesday to vice president george bush but said he wasnt giving 
up the fight for the republican presidential nomination 
we know that we wont be the frontrunner after super tuesday 
but its not over after super tuesday he told a crowd of about 
80 supporters during a brief rally at the springfield regional 
airport were going to win in november 
earlier in oklahoma city he said bush appears strong in the 
south but there may be some surprises and republicans should 
nominate someone who will win the general election 
we dont want to lose the white house by nominating the wrong 
person dole said 
the senator from kansas said his race against bush for 
republican votes in the big round of balloting tuesday was tight in 
oklahoma missouri and north carolina 
were moving very quick in georgia washington state looks 
pretty good dole said at a news conference at will rogers world 
airport there are some opportunities in rhode island and 
massachusetts 
the other states no i think its fair to say george bush has 
a good margin but again there may be some surprises 
the final analysis is what happens in november dole said 
electabilitys going to be a big big factor we dont want to 
lose the white house by nominating the wrong person 
dole displayed a copy of mondays birmingham ala postherald 
which published a survey saying that while bush is the strongest 
candidate among gop primary voters dole is stronger among voters 
of all parties 
i attract a lot of democrats and independents dole said in 
commenting on the newspapers poll which surveyed 1131 voters in 
14 southern states i dont think i scare anybody off i think i 
attract a lot of people 
the senator took a verbal shot at bush when asked whether the 
super tuesday series of primaries and caucuses with gop events in 
17 states and democratic events in 20 states and american samoa 
was too big 
i think what the democrats did was try to design a system 
where they would in effect select the democratic nominee im not 
sure thats going to work he said 
but what could happen is that they might select the weakest 
republican so they might get a consolation prize that way 
on the gop side he said that this is a race between bob dole 
and george bush 
i would invite friends and supporters of new york rep jack 
kemp and pat robertson to take a look at our candidacy and maybe 
join us tuesday night at polling places around the state dole 
said 
dole was joined at the news conference by oklahoma republican 
sen don nickles and several gop members of the state legislature

a federal appeals court monday halted work 
on the navys plans to relocate the aircraft carrier nimitz to 
everett wash a project that has been opposed by environmental 
groups 
in a 30 decision the 9th us circuit court of appeals ordered 
the navy to stop preliminary work on the 272 million project until 
an appeals board reviews a state permit chiefly on the issue of 
how to dispose of contaminated sediment from harbor dredging 
the washington shorelines hearing board began a final week of 
hearings monday on water quality and development permits for the 
project a decision is scheduled in may or june four votes are 
needed on the sixmember board to reject the state permit 
we fully expect that when the project receives full review 
there will be significant modifications said victor sher a 
lawyer for six environmental groups that oppose the dredging 
the ruling means the navy must comply with state environmental 
laws just like everybody else he said 
also opposing the project is the tulalip indian tribe whose 
fishing grounds include everett bay 
lt cmdr joe march a spokesman for the homeport project said 
he would study the ruling to see what options the navy has 
the navy plans to relocate the nimitz and 12 support ships in 
everett harbor on puget sound hoping to have the first ships 
arrive in 1992 
the principal dispute is over the navys plan to dredge about 
34 million cubic yards of sediment from the harbor and dispose of 
it in port gardner bay near crab beds at depths of 310 to 430 feet 
about a third of the sediment is contaminated with heavy metals and 
organic compounds the court said 
the navy plans to cap the contaminated dredging with a 
lawyer of clean sediment but the court said the technique is 
experimental and has been criticized by the us fish and wildlife 
service which said the method had failed both times it had been 
tested at comparable depths

act in its fortress colony on the southern coast of spain

opened fire sunday after the unarmed ira guerrillas parked a white 
renault5 with spanish license plates near the convent the 
official residence of the governor he said the soldiers acted on a 
tip from spanish police 
police said they were searching gibraltar and adjacent spanish 
territory for a car believed connected with a bomb attack the irish 
republican army allegedly planned at the governors residence 
during the ceremonial changing of the guard which hundreds of 
spectators attend

trucks in violence that continued into the evening police reported 
bus service in roman catholic areas was halted after several 
buses were set afire 
a police spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping with british 
practice said he did not know if the attacks were a reaction to 
the reports from gibraltar 
the two men and a woman were shot by men described by witnesses 
as wearing jeans and speaking with british accents 
the british soldiers were believed to be members of the special 
air services or sas an elite undercover unit that has been 
involved in previous actions against the ira

intended for an attack tuesday 
howe acknowledged in his remarks to parliament that the three 
ira members were on foot and unarmed when they were killed sunday 
afternoon while heading for the spanish frontier 
he said they were challenged and made movements which led 
security personnel to believe their lives were in danger 
there is no doubt whatever that as a result of yesterdays 
events a dreadful terrorist act has been averted howe said 
the three people killed were actively involved in the planning 
and attempted execution of that act

bank accounts containing whats left of the fortune 
donated to save livertransplant patient ronnie desillers were 
frozen monday after a judge was told the dead boys mother had 
spent some of the charity money on jewelry clothes and furniture 
a state attorney said 
dade circuit judge francis christie appointed a curator to 
manage the estate in accordance with a petition filed by state 
attorney general robert butterworth and state attorney janet reno 
of miami 
ronnies mother maria desillers has spent more than half of 
the money donated to her 7yearold son who died last year while 
awaiting a fourth transplant the petition said 
among the donors was president reagan who like many others was 
touched by news reports of the theft of funds raised by ronnies 
classmates he gave 1000 
when ronnie died at childrens hospital of pittsburgh last april 
29 an account in his name had accumulated 509913 the petition 
said the account balance on feb 17 was 239288 said fred 
kerstein assistant state attorney and chief of the economic 
criminal division 
as recently as jan 19 1988 25000 had been withdrawn from 
the fund thereby further depleting the assets of the estate 
the petition said 
based upon an examination of bank records at least 47000 
appears to have been expended by maria desillers on jewelry 
clothing furniture housing expenses an automobile and automobile 
expenses these funds having been assets of this estate it said 
there was no further breakdown of the expenditures in the petition 
asked about the allegations in the petition ms desillers said 
why do they not say that money went to charity why do they not 
say that some of that money was assigned to me personally how 
come they dont say how much of that money went to kids 
she said she had already planned to use the money that was 
frozen to help two ailing children who are awaiting transplants 
one from miami and the other from costa rica and would go to 
probate court to straighten out the dispute 
there are two children that have less than six months to live 
and thats what i want to do with the money she said 
ms desillers is being sued by childrens hospital for failing 
to pay 261189 of ronnies 424302 bill 
in refusing to pay the balance ms desillers charged the 
hospital with giving poor care to her son and threatened to file a 
malpractice suit 
ms desillers and her lawyer harold robbins said last month 
they would refuse to pay a 1000 state fine for allegedly 
violating florida charity laws 
she said through robbins that she had never asked the public to 
donate money and she was not legally a charity she also said she 
was entitled to the money as ronnies sole heir 
after ronnies death ms desillers created the foundation to 
assist other children in need of organ transplants 
she returned to the limelight when it was learned that the 
formerly unemployed public relations agent was living in a luxury 
apartment building and driving a bmw equipped with a telephone 
she denied squandering any of the donations explaining that the 
car was secondhand the car telephone was a gift and the apartment 
doubled as her office 
the petition filed by butterworth and ms reno asked that 
ronnies estate be frozen to prevent additional assets of the 
estate from being wasted and to protect persons interested in 
the estate including creditors 
immediate and irreparable injury will result to assets of the 
estate if maria desillers is permitted to withdraw the funds 
the petition said 
attorney karen geivers was appointed estate curator kerstein

the first inmates arrive tuesday at camp 
sauble for 90day terms of hard labor and militarystyle discipline 
that officials hope will keep the young offenders out of the prison 
system 
it is michigans first experiment with a probationary program 
that has caught on in other states the socalled boot camp 
one of about 15 such programs in seven states is a last stop for 
young firsttime felons who otherwise would have been sent to 
prison for at least a year 
a lot of the people put into the corrections system have never 
been held accountable for anything in their lives and as a result 
have never had any pride deputy warden stanley adams said 
here we hope theyll leave with a sense of accomplishment 
because theyll be held accountable for everything they do 
everything includes how their hair is trimmed to how their 
beds are made and how their uniforms are buttoned 
the first dozen of an eventual 156 probationers are expected by 
the end of the week at camp sauble a former state corrections 
department minimumsecurity work camp tucked away in manistee 
national forest in northeast michigan inmates must be between the 
ages of 17 and 25 and never have been in the prison system before 
the inmates will rise at 5 am each day and prepare for an 
inspection of bunks and uniforms after breakfast they will fall 
in for an exercise period before heading out for about seven hours 
of unpaid work in and around mason county 
before dinner there will be more physical training and 
calisthenics and after dinner inmates will attend academic or 
substanceabuse treatment programs one hour will be allowed 
nightly to write letters or watch television news before lights go 
out at 10 pm 
military protocol will be enforced strictly inmates will be 
required to stand at attention when in the presence of an 
instructor and will receive demerits for violations 
if an inmate commits a serious crime such as the assault of a 
staff member or fellow inmate or if he receives three misconduct 
charges he will be returned to the judge who sentenced him likely 
resulting in a prison sentence 
if a candidate passes the program successfully he will be freed 
on probation 
some say the program is an effective way to jolt firsttime 
offenders into straightening out others claim it is a ploy by 
politicians who want their constituents to believe theyre tough on 
crime 
one such critic is jerry miller executive director of national 
alternatives to incarceration 
the people in these programs are usually from families where 
yelling and screaming and putting down are daytoday occurrences 
so a program like this isnt going to scare them said miller 
whose nonprofit organization based in alexandria va studies 
programs that keep offenders out of prison

three palestinian guerrillas seized a 
commuter bus monday and held nuclear plant workers hostage killing 
three israeli civilians and wounding nine before police shot the 
hijackers to death officials said 
the palestine liberation organization claimed responsibility 
saying in a statement released in nicosia cyprus that the 
hijacking was part of escalating military action against israel 
the statement said the guerrillas launched the attack from 
within israel and did not infiltrate from a neighboring country 
israeli army officials said the guerrillas infiltrated from 
egypt and held 10 women and one man hostage for about three hours 
the bus was seized as it shuttled workers of the topsecret dimona 
nuclear plant 
in the occupied territories at least 12 arabs were shot monday 
during clashes with israeli troops and the army said palestinian 
protesters hurled a grenade at troops wounding one soldier 
slightly in the west bank village of idna 
also more than 20 arab tax collectors in the gaza strip 
submitted mass resignations after underground leaflets called for 
palestinians to quit working for israels military administration 
an army official says the resignations are not final 
israeli analysts said escalating violence could harden the 
position of prime minister yitzhak shamir and the rightwing likud 
bloc which has not accepted the peace initiatives of us 
secretary of state george p shultz 
defense minister yitzhak rabin told israels knesset or 
parliament that mondays bus victims were killed for mothing 
else but for their being jewish residents of israel 
in an anonymous telephone call to a western news agency in 
israel a man said the hijacking was the work of plos force 17 a 
palestinian commando group linked to plo chairman yasser arafat 
if the commandos did come from egypt it would mark the eighth 
infiltration into israel from egypt jordan or lebanon since late 
november 
shamir said the infiltrations and the three months of violence 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip were part of a plo 
strategy 
these are the same people who incite violence in the 
occupied territories we shall not tire from fighting them 
shamir said on israel radio 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman 
condemned the hijacking and noted with sadness that at a time 
when the majority are looking for a peaceful solution of the 
arabisraeli conflict terrorists emerge to attack the innocents 
foreign minister shimon peres a leader of israels doves said 
the hijacking was an indication of why israel refused to deal with 
arafat 
this shows exactly why the plo is a disaster for both arabs 
and jews peres said 
lt gen dan shomron the armed forces chief of staff said the 
guerrillas crossed the lightly guarded border from egypt and he 
criticized egyptian authorities for not doing more to stop such 
infiltrations 
army officials said the terrorists were armed with fragmentation 
grenades two soviet kalashnikov assault rifles and a swedishmade 
karl gustav submachine gun 
the arab gunmen first seized a small military vehicle at about 7 
am near the nafha prison a few miles from the sinai desert 
border with egypt 
the guerrillas riding in the captured vehicle went on a 
rampage along the highway shooting at passing cars and trucks and 
wounding one israeli man in the leg police officials said 
police chased the car and shot out a tire forcing the 
guerrillas to abandon the vehicle police said 
the guerrillas then seized the redandwhite bus carrying 
workers to the dimona nuclear plant during which the bus driver 
and all but 11 passengers escaped police later stopped the vehicle 
by barricading the road near the aroer junction 
the arab trio was headed toward beersheva away from the nuclear 
facility when they seized the bus indicating the facility was not 
the target of the guerrillas 
the guerrillas gave israeli authorities one hour to produce an 
international red cross official and free jailed palestinians 
they presented an ultimatum if their demand were not met 
within half an hour including the release of detainees and 
palestinian terrorists they will kill the hostages said maj 
gen yitzhak mordechai the armys southern commander 
moments later mordechai said the guerrilla leader fatally shot 
in the chest victor ran 39 the father of three children 
when they fired and executed one of the hostages and fired at 
the women who were in the bus despite our promises that we will 
not harm them we stormed the bus and killed the three 
terrorists mordechai said on israel radio 
he said the assault by antiterror police lasted about one 
minute 
rina shiratzky 31 the mother of two and miriam ben yair 46 
the mother of four were fatally wounded when israeli soldiers 
stormed the bus 
mordechai said an investigation showed the shots were fired by 
the arab guerrillas

cardinal jozef glemp leader of polands 
roman catholic church said monday he has been invited to visit 
moscow in early june for ceremonies marking the 1000th anniversary 
of russian christendom 
no polish primate has ever visited the soviet union 
glemp said he received the invitation last month to attend 
observances organized by the russian orthodox church 
there have been no talks yet glemp told reporters at 
warsaws okecie airport after returning from a weeklong visit to 
rome where he met with polishborn pope john paul ii i only got 
a formal invitation i want to go obviously 
church sources have said a visit by glemp to the soviet union 
could help pave the way for a future visit there by the pope 
in january john paul said he would visit the soviet union only 
if he could meet with roman catholics around the country 
glemp has let it be known he would like to visit the soviet 
union especially former polish territories in the soviet 
lithuanian republic that has a large polish minority and where the 
catholic faith is quite strong 
asked whether he planned to visit other places than moscow 
glemp said he might change from an official church representative 
into a tourist for a few hours with pleasure because there are 
many things to see there 
the soviet invitation reflects a turnaround since mikhail s 
gorbachev came to power three years ago 
the soviets previously attacked the polish church for inspiring 
opposition activities but more recently have made overtures to 
polish catholics 
almost 90 percent of polands population is catholic

soldiers in tanks and 
jeeps patrolled the main streets and poorer areas of the capital 
monday to block further protests against the rising cost of living 
president joaquin balaguer summoned his advisers to discuss ways 
of controlling inflation a major factor in recent unrest in this 
caribbean island nation of more than 65 million people 
protesters burned tires early monday during a 24hour strike in 
five lowincome sectors of santo domingo 
three days of clashes last week between protesters and soldiers 
left one person dead and many businesses damaged more than 300 
people were arrested 
the previous week three people were killed and eight injured in 
protests in eight of the countrys 26 provinces 
support seemed to be dwindling for a general strike called for 
wednesday to demand lower prices for basic commodities wage 
increases for public and private workers and better public services 
we are willing to talk and hold sincere discussions with the 
authorities to solve the conflict as long as they manifest their 
sincere willingness to satisfy our demands said spokeswoman 
virtudes alvarez of the national conference of popular 
organizations 
the group called for the general strike and organized earlier 
strikes in the last few weeks that shut down many parts of the 
capital 
labor groups opposed the strike but promised to support it if 
it takes place they want either a later strike or talks among the 
government unions and business community to try to solve the 
economic problems 
the main opposition party the dominican revolutionary party is 
also against the strike although leftwing political parties 
support it 
balaguer said sunday he would meet with his agricultural 
advisers merchants and business people to develop a plan to 
implement price controls 
shortages of many goods including milk have become prevalent 
a private economist estimated the february inflation rate at 
about 5 percent and predicted a 50 to 60 percent rate for 1988 if 
that continued 
private sources have estimated inflation in 1987 at around 30 
percent although the governments central bank maintains it was 
closer to 16 percent

yourcenar and they dont want to settle for less 
the increased interest in quality books in a country where 
newspaper readership is the lowest in europe comes more than a 
decade after the demise of gen francisco francos dictatorship and 
his 36 years of cultural and intellectual repression 
the change has been fairly sudden it is due in part to spains 
1986 entry into the european common market which has broadened many 
horizons de herralde also credited the newfound market to a 
decline in ideological topics and obscure experimental writing by 
some authors and a return to the narrative both in spanish and 
foreign literature 
those in the publishing industry centered mainly in this 
northeastern port city say spaniards are now looking beyond their 
borders learning foreign languages and reading good books 
a 1985 study initiated by the ministry of culture on spanish 
cultural behavior said that although 80 percent of spanish 
households possessed books mainly encyclopedias or technical 
manuals only 41 percent read any of them 
the study also showed that the spanish reading public is heavily 
concentrated in madrid and in catalonia of which barcelona is the 
capital the the most developed and educated regions of spain the 
illiteracy rate is 74 percent in a population of 368 million 
third highest in the 12nation european economic community after 
greece and portugal results also revealed that fewer than 11 
percent of spaniards ever set foot inside a library 
many people are still afraid to go inside bookstores or 
libraries because they think theyre only for intellectuals said 
manuel ripoll producer of entrelineas between the lines 
spanish state tvs new literary program thats why so many of 
the books sold in spain are purchased at corner newsstands 
de herralde pointed out that the biggest single bookseller in 
spain with items ranging from howto manuals to poetry 
collections is el corte ingles the countrys only department 
store chain 
translations of foreign works primarily american and english 
books make up about 70 percent of the lists of anagrama circe 
and other quality houses the other 30 percent is devoted to the 
works of established or new spanish authors 
five years ago de herralde a 52yearold former industrial 
engineer took a chance on john kennedy tooles a confederacy of 
dunces a cult novel published in the united states when the 
unknown authors mother brought the manuscript to a publisher after 
his suicide the book earned the author a posthumous pulitzer prize 
in 1981 
the spanish edition has gone into 22 printings and has sold 
100000 copies the translation into catalan a language spoken by 
more than 5 million people in the northeastern part of the country 
is due out in april 
pilar raola director of the catalan publishing house editorial 
portic said many spanishreading catalans preferred to wait to 
read a translation of a foreign novel in their own language 
resulting in a similar upsurge in catalanlanguage publishing 
according to the spanish association of book publishers 38814 
titles were published in spain in 1986 of which 7483 were novels 
and essays the average press run for a spanish novel is between 
3500 and 4000 copies 
felix de azuas diary of a humiliated man has gone into its 
third printing at anagrama in three months following its 
publication in december after winning the firms coveted herralde 
literary award 
chilean author isabel allendes eva luna and belle du 
seigneur by french author albert cohen have been jockeying for 
first place on the bestseller list of spains leading newspaper el 
pais for the past six months five of the 10 topselling books on 
the list are by spanish authors 
the most successful spanish novel this century is jose maria 
gironellas cypresses believe in god set in the years leading 
up to the 193639 spanish civil war since its publication in the 
late 1950s the book has sold over 4 million copies 
the burst of interest in quality fiction has led spanish 
publishing giants to set up smaller collections devoted to serious 
fiction and essays de herralde said 
and the nationwide readers circle book club began including 
quality foreign and domestic fiction several years ago at the 
request of its 13 million members according to spokesman hans 
gentz

pssst looking for unspoiled scenery 
cheap extras and good local technicians for filming on location 
its still a wordofmouth proposition but some of the worlds 
leading filmmakers are discovering venezuelas steamy jungles vast 
savannahs and palmstudded beaches for shooting their exotic 
location shots 
the south american country is being promoted as a cheaper and 
more accessible alternative to brazil and a nonpoliticized 
substitute for south africa 
british producer derek granger brought sir alec guinness and 
james wilby star of a room with a view to the jungles near 
canaima 400 miles southeast of caracas in late january to film a 
portion of a handful of dust based on the novel by evelyn 
waugh 
the french director alain siritzky came last november to check 
out scenery in canaima and caracas for the sixth movie in the 
emmanuelle series now being shot for him by a local film group 
last october two episodes of the tv series dynasty were 
filmed here they involve a jungle rescue 
and venezuela recently beat out jamaica to provide various beach 
sites for a series of pepsicola commercials 
for directors who are interested in the kinds of scenes shot 
in brazil or mexico or argentina we are unbeatable were the 
cheapest the freshest and we have good technicians said george 
korda a hungarianborn venezuelan whose company korda films is 
undertaking the emmanuelle project 
filmmakers attribute the growing interest in venezuela in part 
to the neverending quest by directors for something unique and 
untouched something that ideally no other director has used 
before 
everybody knows about brazil and mexico and theyre a bit 
tired of that so theyre discovering venezuela said korda 
but venezuelas attitude toward foreign filmmakers has also 
changed they say along with the value of its currency successive 
devaluations of the bolivar since 1983 have made it possible for 
directors to put up actors and crewmen in three or four star hotels 
for 20 a night extras can be hired for 13 a day a marvelous 
wage in a nation where the urban minimum wage is 65 a month 
foreign directors say they have found local production companies 
fully competent for backup work many venezuelans in film were 
trained abroad under government scholarships 
and venezuelas jungles are also more accessible because they 
are smaller than brazils vast amazon basin and closer to 
population centers 
our location manager said it would be easier to film here 
than work in the heart of brazil granger said in an interview 
we had only 10 days to film we needed good immediate facilities 
good hotels and easy means of transport 
and the government which has been interested in promoting 
tourism ever since oil prices fell is content to see the movie 
people come local promoters say 
however some have found the government difficult to work with 
the arts crew of a handful of dust could not get the venezuelan 
guayana corp which controls the national park in which canaima is 
located to provide the animals so they instead had to rent 
parrots monkeys and deer from a local landowner 
but theres another message that venezuelan promoters are 
beginning to whisper stable government no racial problems 
except for the animals some venezuelan landscapes are dead 
ringers for the south african savannah 
this new selling point could take on more weight as more 
studios including the 120 americans banded together in the 
industry pressure group filmmakers united against apartheid seek 
to avoid possible commercial backlashes from filming in south 
africa 
there are places here that look just like south africa only 
were much closer and we dont have racial problems or a civil 
war said rolando haiek whose company 5247 producciones was 
hired by granger to provide everything needed locally for a 
handful of dust 
5247 productions now hopes to get a canadian production company 
to film miss helen a story set in south africa in venezuela 
instead

anwar sadat won the nobel peace prize and 
the admiration of the west with a leadership that dared break new 
political and social ground including making peace with israel 
the same selfassured decisiveness made the warrior president a 
hero to his countrymen in the early 1970s especially after the 
1973 arabisraeli war in which he could claim his bold moves led to 
an egyptian victory over israel in the sinai peninsula 
but in the years leading up to his assassination oct 6 1981 
as sadats temperament changed many egyptians turned against him 
even though he remained widely admired abroad 
those latter years are the ones being recalled now as members of 
sadats family return to a courtroom march 12 for a hearing to 
determine whether the government can confiscate property it claims 
was acquired through corruption 
although the case against sadats brother esmat and 10 members 
of his immediate family is connected only remotely to anwar the 
late presidents detractors contend that sadats presidency is on 
trial they contend that sadats opendoor economic policy led to 
the kind of corrupt practices his brother was tried for and 
convicted of 
corruption increased in president sadats time said khaled 
mohieddin head of the opposition national unionist progressive 
party an umbrella of marxists and nasserites people just 
grabbed money and ran away 
like sadat mohieddin was a member of the revolution command 
council that ended the monarchy of king farouk in 1952 the council 
acted under gamal abdel nasser republican egypts first president 
and sadats predecessor 
during the sadat presidency esmat sadat allegedly amassed an 
illegal fortune despite laterdisclosed efforts by the president to 
stop his brothers profiting on their relationship 
his activities were so blatant that on the first anniversary of 
sadats assassination by moslem extremists president hosni mubarak 
reportedly told him your stench has spread throughout the 
country im not going to protect anyone 
a little later he was arrested and tried esmat sadat three 
sons and seven other family members were convicted on 24 counts of 
influence peddling black marketeering and bribery 
their property was sequestered and esmat and three of his sons 
served nine months of a oneyear prison term the new court case is 
for confiscation of their wealth estimated at 82 million 
esmat and his children were a dangerous burden on anwar sadat 
in his life and after his death said moussa sabry a sadat 
confidant who writes a regular column at the government newspaper 
alakhbar 
when you see they traded and stole and have millions of 
course they used his name people used to be intimidated into 
doing what they wanted some people say he was not responsible 
for his brothers but of course it affects 
esmats trial spotlighted infitah the opendoor economic 
policy that sadat came up with in the mid1970s with its 
loopholes it created many esmats a class of the newly rich 
additionally it created public frustration over the massive influx 
of flashy imports of luxury goods from cars to designer 
sunglasses that were unaffordable for most egyptians 
the policy served mainly private interests and foreign companies 
in joint ventures many wealthy businessmen feeling egypts 
present economic pinch look back with regret at sadats 
initiatives 
egypt was not being transformed from a planned to a market 
economy but to a supermarket economy wrote mohammed heikal a 
close adviser to nasser and sadat until they fell out over foreign 
policy 
the disrupting effect which this transformation had on 
egyptian society can hardly be exaggerated heikal wrote in 
autumn of fury a bitter book about sadats assassination that 
was banned in egypt for two years after its publication in 1983 
in the books introduction heikal said he collected much of his 
information from fellow prisoners after sadat jailed him and 1535 
others in a crackdown on domestic dissenters a month before his 
death 
some watched closely to see whether the decision permitting the 
sale of the book would start a downgrading of sadats memory but 
anwar sadat remains an honored figure in government eyes because 
the bullets that killed him did little to change the governing 
system he had built 
his portrait remains posted on a major suburban road behind a 
guest house the government gave his family his tomb in another 
suburb shares a place of honor with that of egypts unknown 
soldier the largest station of cairos new subway system the 
first named is sadat station 
nevertheless much of the popular local support sadat had won by 
making peace with israel and his vow of no more war was eroded 
by the wave of arrests in september 1981 moreover he shut down a 
halfdozen moslem and coptic christian publications withdrew state 
recognition of coptic pope shenouda iii and banished him to a 
desert monastery thereby alienating egypts 6 million copts 
a year after sadats death esmats trial came as a welcome 
change to many people in a country where authorities often turned a 
blind eye to dubious acts by the powerful eager crowds outside the 
courthouse cheered long live justice on hearing days and when 
the verdict and sentence were read about 300 spectators in the 
courtroom burst into applause 
commenting on sadats legacy after seven years moussa sabry 
said the egyptians and not only the egyptians but the arab 
people have started to realize that this mans view was ahead of 
egypts thinking he actually managed to create peace between egypt 
and israel and to get back our land 
in her recently published memoirs sadats widow jihan wistfully 
conceded that sadats star has not shone as brightly with his 
compatriots as she feels it should have 
someday egyptians will recognize what anwar did for his 
country and give him his rightful place in history she wrote 
with patience i wait

robert gobinot isnt given much chance in his 
candidacy for the office of president but hes getting some 
attention with his idea to restore an orchard owners benefit 
dating back to the french revolution 
in 1791 owners of orchards were granted the right to distill 
taxfree each year 26 gallons of eau de vie the alcoholic 
beverage that is sipped after meals and called pousse cafe or 
digestif the distillers would pay no tax so long as they 
didnt offer it for sale 
the license to distill was passed on from one generation to 
another until 1961 when a new law canceled the right to inherit the 
license 
eau de vie comes in various forms depending on the region in 
normandy for example it is made from apples and is called 
calvados in alsace in eastern france pears and plums are used in 
the auvergne region of central france it is made from hazelnuts 
when my mother died six months ago i inherited her orchard 
said gobinot but the license died with her and so i can no 
longer make eau de vie without paying tax 
gobinots bucolic campaign headquarters is his 60acre sheep 
farm in the village of chezeaux in the hautmarne department of 
eastern france 
his name does not figure in the opinion polls he has no 
political party machine behind him or image advisers cultivating a 
presidential package for the balloting april 24 and runoff may 8 
but he has been getting his message out and has already received 
letters of support from 500 mayors the minimum necessary to 
declare his candidacy formally 
our method of raising support is by word of mouth gobinot 
said in a telephone interview 
but he thinks it unlikely that he will become francois 
mitterrands successor in the presidency he is simply using the 
elections he said to defend what he sees as an honorable rural 
tradition 
others however compare the lot of french eau de vie distillers 
to the tale of tristan and isolde or the myth of the eternal 
return because the argument to restore the inherited licenses 
resurfaces from time to time 
in a country that has one of the highest rates of alcoholism in 
the world the abolition of the right to distill taxfree eau de 
vie might seem like a good thing but gobinot disagrees 
he wants to clean up the image of the bouilleurs de cru as 
eau de vie makers are known 
we want people to realize that we are not just purveyors of 
alcoholism he said 
gobinot maintains that the major distilleries are more to blame 
for the problem of alcoholism than farmers who make a couple of 
gallons out of plums or apples 
according to gobinot 211 million gallons of alcohol were drunk 
in france last year of which just 15840 gallons were homemade eau 
de vie 
this shows how ridiculous the argument is he said we 
make less than 1 percent of the total consumption in france 
gobinot emphasizes that traditional rural skills and therefore 
jobs are disappearing as a result of the 1961 law only a handful 
of craftsmen making wooden barrels remain and the fruit trees are 
no longer pruned as they used to be he said 
the distiller with his alambic ambulant mobile still 
going from village to village in normandy to turn apples into 
calvados was once a familiar figure 
the farmer who picks his own fruit is proud to distill his own 
eau de vie gobinot said he does everything himself and is 
making a natural product 
i drink very little myself but i take great pleasure in 
offering a glass of friendship when people come to my house

in less than a generation japan has slashed its 
infant death rate to the lowest in the world thanks to a formula 
that combines intensive prenatal care with government policy 
but japan also has one of the worlds highest abortion rates 
which could help in keeping figures low for the infantdeath rate 
the officially reported infant mortality rate in any case has 
fallen from a high of more than 60 deaths per 1000 in the years 
after world war ii to 49 per 1000 in 1987 meaning that of every 
1000 babies born 9951 will live to their first birthdays 
no other nation comes close the united states lags far behind 
with a rate of 106 per 1000 finland and sweden rank second 
behind japan with 60 according to 1986 figures 
experts list several things that led to japans low rate 
a literate society eager for medical advice 
a system of universal health insurance 
a maternal and child health handbook standard issue for every 
pregnant woman since world war ii which has 58 pages of health 
records and advice on pregnancy and child care from birth to age 6 
a typical japanese mother is a married woman in her late 20s 
the safest ages for childbearing and she is pregnant with her 
first or second child the handbook tells her what to eat how much 
milk to drink and when to visit a doctor by the time labor pains 
begin she will have undergone about a dozen prenatal checkups two 
of them courtesy of the government 
a japanese mother is very interested in her own health and the 
child to be born said dr kazuaki miyagishima of the health 
ministrys maternal and child health division she follows 
intensive prenatal care 
like virtually all mothers of her generation she gives birth in 
a delivery room her hospital stay lasts a week giving doctors 
time to keep watch on the baby insurance takes care of most of the 
costs which usually run about 200000 yen 1560 depending on 
need the government will pay the rest and add 100000 yen 780 
as a gift 
officials provide coupons for free checkups for the baby and 
send a public health nurse to the home legions of volunteers pay 
monthly house calls on rural newborns and report their progress to 
local officials 
but abortions are not figured in the official infant mortality 
rate the abortion figures themselves are difficult to establish 
japans registered abortion rate is 171 per 1000 women of 
childbearing age near the top among western nations doctors say 
however the real figure could be two to four times higher because 
not all abortions are reported to the government as required by 
law adding the doctors estimates of unreported abortions would 
put japan well ahead of the united states which had a 1983 rate of 
274 per 1000 
officials say the hidden abortions take place among teenagers 
while they accounted for only 54 percent of registered abortions 
in 1986 that number has been rising along with teen pregnancies 
babies born to teens and women over 35 are at highest risk for 
late fetal and early neonatal deaths women over 35 are almost 
twice as likely to have infants with congenital defects 
in japan the two groups of highrisk mothers account for 42 
percent of registered abortions and only 88 percent of live 
births they are the only groups among whom abortion is increasing 
looking at the national statistics it seems there could be a 
link between a high rate of abortion among highrisk mothers and 
the infant mortality rate said dr eikkichi matsuyama director 
of obstetrics and gynecology at tokyos kosei nenkin hospital when 
asked why the figures showed infant mortality at the bottom and 
abortions near the top its a connection ive never thought of 
until now but its not illogical 
japans eugenic protection law allows abortions even as late as 
the second trimester of pregnancy to prevent the increase of 
inferior descendants and to protect the life of the mother 
abortion is quite a big program in japanese family planning 
said haruo konagai of the japan family planning association 
onefourth of japanese women have experienced abortions 
matsuyama and others say that preventing highrisk births is not 
the key to lowering infant mortality they say its an incidental 
factor in an already successful program 
but the government is pushing programs for telephone counseling 
and sex education in schools to lower the teenage abortion rate 
miyagishima said 
in general mother and child health is on a high standard 
already he said it is a very hard task to find a new 
target

one of the reasons given for so 
many healthy babies in japan is the tender care corps an 
organization of volunteer women who visit new mothers and their 
babies in their own homes 
the corps operates on the tradition that neighbors look out for 
each other it mobilizes 80000 mothers who volunteer to keep tabs 
on the health of 2 million households with children in japans 
outlying cities and hamlets 
here in yamato village a collection of small farms and quarries 
perched among mountaintop forests volunteer hatsuko hirayama 
visits six families every month she makes her rounds on foot over 
steep paths and concretepaved roads 60 miles west of tokyo 
our purpose is to see that healthy babies are born 
explained mrs hirayama a woman in her fifties with children of 
her own the public health nurse cant always visit homes so i 
do 
one of the mothers she visits is yoshimi hirayama a distant 
relative in this town of 1890 people the visits began when the 
24yearold housewife became pregnant with her second child which 
turned out to be a daughter michiko who now is now 10 months old 
she told me to breast feed yoshimi said she told me to 
eat things that would build bones small fish lots of milk 
shes like another mother when i had my first baby i didnt 
know anybody here but i could go to mrs hirayama and ask her 
anything 
yoshimis pregnancy was normal she followed her doctors 
instructions to undergo health checks every three weeks during the 
first two trimesters then biweekly and weekly until delivery in 
between came prenatal care and childbirth classes at the village 
hall 
in april after she gave birth to michiko a public health nurse 
stopped by to check on the mother and baby after their return from 
the hospital mrs hirayama took it from there 
any teeth she asked on a recent visit pulling down 
michikos lower lip are you hiding them 
her notes on michikos diet bedtimes and skin color are turned 
over to the health nurse who evaluates them and recommends 
doctors visits or looks in on the baby herself if necessary 
mrs hirayama fills in monthly visit cards for each child she 
sees on her rounds until the child turns 6 then it is time for 
school teachers to keep an eye out

richard burt has been a guest on a hit 
tv variety show sung with a west berlin rock group sold potato 
pancakes on bonns main square and gets his name and picture in 
the papers 
that may not be unusual for a celebrity but it is for an 
ambassador 
its a fantastic opportunity says us ambassador burt to 
reach 20 million ordinary west germans 
since taking up his post here in september 1985 burt has become 
a regular fixture in west germanys news media and on television 
news stories about him range from the birth of his son 
christopher last year to his constant efforts to present the reagan 
administrations message 
the public affairs dimension of diplomacy is growing more 
important the 41yearold diplomat a former new york times 
reporter said in an interview with the associated press in his 
bonn office 
burt made it clear he feels that reaching out to ordinary west 
germans is a major part of his job 
in a democratic country you have in a way two 
constituencies one the government which you are accredited to but 
secondly you have public opinion which has an impact on the 
government 
theres been a certain interest in a younger ambassador 
burt said to some extent i think ive taken advantage of that 
interest to try to project a fun openminded dynamic image of the 
united states 
at the age of 38 he became the youngest us ambassador in west 
german history he took over the post from arthur burns who was 
then 81 and known for his reserved formal ways 
burt said hes made a special effort to win over west 
germanys young people tens of thousands of whom took to the 
streets in 1983 to protest the installation of us missiles in the 
country 
they dont remember care packages the marshall plan and the 
berlin airlift burt said referring to vital us postwar relief 
and aid programs they remember vietnam 
among burts most heavily publicized exploits was his singing 
stint with the west berlin rock group at a recording studio in 
january 1986 
articles and pictures filled west german newspapers afterward 
that was not sought after he said i was a little bit 
naive at that point 
this past nov 28 burt appeared on a television stunt and 
variety show called wetten dass will you bet that 
the superstar moderator thomas gottschalk asked burt can 
you imagine that one day you wont just be called your 
excellence but also mr president and i can still call you 
rick 
speaking in slow halting german burt responded with a smile 
i will be president when you are the federal chancellor west 
germanys leader 
asked in the interview about that appearance burt replied 
heres 20 million people who are never going to get a chance to 
meet an american ambassador he was he said a fantastic 
opportunity to project a positive image 
burt lost his bet on a stunt on the saturday night show so 
three weeks later as agreed before the tv audience he went bonns 
main square and sold potato pancakes in a pouring rain to raise 
money for charity 
sometimes burts pronouncements especially on us foreign 
policy have brought criticism from west germans 
in a fullpage guest essay printed in the influential magazine 
der spiegel on feb 22 burt expounded on the idea that the nato 
allies must share with the united states the risks of a nuclear a 
war 
the contribution printed in german brought a sharp retort the 
following week from egon bahr the 66yearold arms control expert 
of the opposition social democratic party 
he finds it simply unreasonable bahr wrote that the 
united states should remain a target for nuclear weapons while 
europe is freed from the burden of the stationing of nuclear 
arms i dont 
bahr continued the family that lives near the border with the 
german democratic republic east germany during any conflict runs 
an incomparably bigger risk than a family in iowa 
during the interview burt was asked whether he looked forward 
to overseeing the removal of the intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles from west germany after ratification of the ussoviet 
missile accord 
burt responded with a laugh and said its an interesting 
question because before coming to germany when i was assistant 
secretary of state for europe i worked very very hard to put them 
in so i havent really focused on taking them out

when miriam birch left home to join the 
circus she went all the way to the soviet union 
for a national geographic special birch and her camera crew 
spent nine weeks following circuses across the soviet union which 
has more such extravaganzas than any other country 
the onehour inside the soviet circus produced and written 
by birch will be broadcast wednesday on pbs theodore bikel 
narrates 
the circus is a part of everyday life in the ussr and attracts 
more than 70 million people a year more than 100 troupes all 
governmentsupported travel the vast country from leningrad to 
vladivostok 
it was in the ukraine that birch found one of the stars for the 
special oleg popov for 40 years he has clowned in a soviet 
onering circus his humor is universal and cuts across all 
international barriers 
the russian circus is a world unto itself said birch you 
dont need to know the language to get the jokes its exciting 
its colorful and its very good circus the government doesnt 
spare any expense they want the people to enjoy it 
the tradition of the russian circus goes back many years to the 
wandering juggler trained bears gypsies and tightrope walkers 
the european circus came to russia at the time of catherine 
the great she said she ordered horses from england a certain 
gentleman brought not only riding horses but trick horses as well 
catherine was very taken with the horses and the man she had a 
circus building erected in st petersburg which is now leningrad 
the russian circuses are always one ring and the aerialists 
work without a net they emphasize artistry not danger the clowns 
come on between the acts to distract the audience while the props 
are being moved the clowns are very skilled at mocking what just 
happened 
although she calls it one of the most interesting experiences of 
her life birch said i was happy to leave id also be happy to 
go back its just the thought of settling down in one of those 
exotic locales theyre never quite as exotic as they look from the 
outside 
id much rather capture their essence on film than live there 
i like going there and coming back 
traveling to exotic and remote areas of the world is not new for 
birch in the past she has written and produced geographic 
specials on pandas in china horses in ireland and the living 
treasures of japan egypt and jerusalem 
she was interviewed the day before leaving for the island of 
bali and shanghai china to research possible specials she was 
accompanied by thomas skinner of wqed pittsburgh and dennis kane of 
the national geographic society who are coexecutive producers of 
the specials 
both bali and shanghai are shrouded in romance and 
mysticism she said bali would be a cultural show emphasizing 
the arts puppet theater and dance all of the arts on bali are

japanese economic competition with the united 
states is often viewed negatively especially by autoworkers hurt 
by imports but the japanese have also come bearing gifts 
they raised levels of quality they forced competitors to rid 
themselves of waste at every level from plant floor to chairmans 
office they compelled us management to get off its duff and 
innovate 
but their biggest contribution might be in managementlabor 
relations at least in the automobile industry and it was in that 
industry that relations had in effect become proceedings in a 
divorce case 
for complex reasons workers and executives had become such foes 
that it might have been better had they never spoken to each other 
each depended for survival on making cars but they fought each 
other they were rigidly set 
in competitive markets rigidity leads to death competition 
according to nobel laureate friedrich hayek is a dynamic 
discovery procedure it never stops if one company ceases to 
innovate another surely will 
in the united states automotive industry unions helped 
frustrate innovation by inflexible work rules job classifications 
and resistance to technological change while simultaneously 
insisting on higher wages 
attitudes began changing slowly as the japanese starting from a 
zero base grabbed almost a quarter of the us market and now 
according to a university report union and management now see 
salvation rather than ruin in the new way 
the new way is japanese at least as it applies to labor 
relations the japanese way according to thomas dilorenzo is for 
unions to be enterprising and cooperative for the common good of 
themselves and the company 
dilorenzo a fellow at the center for the study of american 
business at st louis washington university observes that 
japanese unions have a strong interest in strengthening the 
competitive position of the employer 
national unions seldom interfere in local decisions members 
recognize that job security is possible only in a healthy company 
they accept transfers to different areas of the plant they perform 
a variety of jobs they take pay cuts in the form of reduced 
bonuses as an alternative to mass layoffs 
dilorenzo feels american workers are increasingly receptive to 
such procedures citing the japanesestyle labor relations already 
practiced at the new united motor manufacturing plant a 
toyotageneral motors joint venture 
that plant at fremont calif had been an intense headache for 
gm which closed it in 1982 with the loss of 5000 jobs 
between 1963 and that year there were four shutdowns for 
sickouts and strikes absenteeism forced the assembly line to 
close drugs and alcohol were just two of many problems labor 
relations were acrimonious almost violent 
inevitably the productivity level at the plant was incredible 
it took an average of 34 manhours of labor to produce a vehicle 
compared to only 20 hours to produce a toyota and the final 
product sometimes was a mess 
cooperation is now a twoway street according to dilorenzo 
management has made written promises of job security and has agreed 
to take salary cuts before laying off workers 
in addition union and management have promised to work together 
to resolve problems arising from layoffs production schedule 
changes major investments and daytoday decisions once left 
entirely to management 
the united auto workers union has made other unusual concessions 
to help with productivity and profits it agreed to reduce job 
classes from more than 200 to three eliminating featherbedding it 
allowed workers to be trained for several jobs allowing 
manufacturing flexibility 
the two oncevicious enemies also adopted the japanese technique 
of kaisan under which workers and management have regular 
discussions on how to perform jobs more efficiently for their 
mutual benefit 
already says dilorenzo evidence that parts of the experiment 
might become fixtures in us managementlabor relations can be 
found in the uaw contracts with ford and gm in 1987 which permit 
an unprecedented degree of cooperation 
there is recognition that labor and management are not competing 
against one another says dilorenzo the competition lies 
elsewhere he says as it always has

editors note wherever he goes a small army goes with him 
virtually everything he does in public is planned scripted and 
rehearsed even a visit to a club two blocks from the white house 
follows an elaborate scenario thats the insulating apparatus of 
the presidency today it wasnt always that way 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
harry truman liked to take a walk every 
morning a habit he didnt abandon even after franklin d roosevelt 
died 
promptly at 7 am the president a fedora on his head and 
usually a cane in his hand would set off from the white house at a 
brisk 120 paces a minute 
the route varied sometimes across lafayette square and up 
connecticut avenue sometimes on a circuit of the washington 
monument and lincoln memorial 
taxi drivers would shout their hellos sometimes the president 
paused to sign an autograph for a tourist 
often a reporter or two showed up joining the president and his 
brace of secret service men 
a few weeks ago president reagan went two blocks along one of 
trumans walking routes to dedicate the newly rebuilt army and navy 
club here is what happened 
when the motorcade of nine white house cars and an ambulance 
escorted by district of columbia police cars and motorcycles 
pulled up at the club at 1030 am the presidents limousine 
pulled into an unadorned side entrance leading to a loading dock 
club officials had wanted reagan to come in the elegant front 
door but a white house advance team had vetoed the idea in a 
meeting with club officers two weeks earlier too dangerous 
stepping from his limo the president walked to a freight 
elevator carpeted for the occasion through a loading dock area 
that had been cleared of clutter 
from the elevator the white house had first proposed that the 
president pass through the firstfloor kitchen club officers 
however wanted the president to see some of the memorabilia the 
cannon seized in the spanishamerican war the preliminary casting 
of the iwo jima memorial the busts of truman and eisenhower that 
line the long secondfloor hall they call the parade so they ended 
up greeting the president on the second floor 
in a routine that had been rehearsed for days brig gen james 
d hittle the retired marine officer who is the club president 
was supposed to open a door to guide reagan into the main ballroom 
as they reached the door gray terry deputy director of the 
office of presidential advance whispered to hittle not in here 
the doors locked hittle opened another door into the ballroom 
a few yards down the hall then the president was taken down a 
circular staircase to pass through a receiving line of club 
officials and their wives and to cut a ribbon 
hittle then escorted the president into the dining room the 
other officers had already taken their places 
it had all been rehearsed with terry playing the part of 
reagan the second of the two steps that led up to the dais had 
been marked with adhesive tape as a precaution against stumbling 
the white drapes in the windows normally drawn back were lowered 
the window at the end where the president would speak was 
protected by a bulletproof glass shield 
in the old days im told the army and navy club often 
invited their neighbor the president to all their parties 
reagan said in his remarks ive also heard that benjamin 
harrison and grover cleveland walked over for a toddy or two oh 
for the good old days 
those days are gone forever 
this simple presidential visit planned since the clubs 
invitation was accepted months before had required the initial 
meeting with 16 white house people two weeks earlier at least two 
walkthroughs a number of rehearsals several more meetings on the 
site and constant telephone calls for more than a week beforehand 
the white house had been working on communications for the 
president and his staff a holding room was needed for the 
president a place where he could receive or make a telephone call 
if needed 
club officers proposed an office just off the lobby but the 
lobby was too crowded the second time they were over they 
asked is there a better place said hittle finally they 
chose a modest security room near the loading dock half an hour 
before the president arrived traffic on surrounding streets and 
access to the building were sealed off 
every moment that he is before the public the president is 
backed up by a script that spells out his every motion a staff 
that looks after his protection and his image and an aerial fleet 
that can carry limousines and tons of communications equipment 
anywhere in the world 
no other leader not even the pope in rome in some respects is 
accompanied by quite the pomp and circumstance that follow the 
president of the united states wherever he goes 
some presidents have chafed at this structured life it seems to 
fit reagan like a glove 
the trappings help fend off possible danger they keep the 
president in constant touch with washington and other world 
capitals they make his public appearances come off smoothly 
they also insulate the leader of the worlds premier democracy 
from the people he leads 
every one of these guys becomes a little more isolated says 
bill gulley former director of the white house military office 
who served under presidents from johnson to carter 
i think the isolation of presidents is dangerous stuff says 
james david barber a duke university political scientist and 
leading student of the presidency 
barber says the president does not get the advice he needs 
when you have the argument going on only in a limited closedin 
coterie 
this is particularly true with a president he says who like 
reagan is very much tuned in to those in the same room with him 
who are right next to him

not for reagan the freedom to browse in bookstores as french 
president francois mitterrand likes to do or to stroll on 
pennsylvania avenue as mitterrand recently did on the champs 
elysees 
a couple of months after his inauguration in 1981 the president 
and first lady nancy reagan did take a walk on a sunny march 
sunday across lafayette park to attend church the next day 
reagan was wounded in an assassination attempt outside a washington 
hotel he hasnt taken a walk in public since 
recent presidents have reacted differently to the increasing 
amount of fuss and security 
the only time that i ever knew a president to get out of the 
corral was johnson gulley says he set his own agenda this 
guy would not only tell me what airplanes to use he would tell me 
who was going to be on the airplane he made up the manifest 
when nixon came along everything was orderly says gulley 
nixon also introduced white tunics black trousers and shiny black 
hats for white house policemen after protests and ridicule the 
officers were allowed to return to workaday police outfits but 
another nixon innovation the use of a marine guard in splendid 
dress uniform as doorkeeper for the west wing is still in effect 
nixon experimented with having smartly uniformed trumpeters 
their horns draped with banners signal the arrival of the 
president at social occasions jimmy carter cut out the traditional 
playing of hail to the chief altogether reagan the performer 
with a flare for the theatrical brought it back 
the president with his background as an actor with a reputation 
for taking direction well still takes direction well 
he has said of his sacramento period for eight years 
somebody handed me a piece of paper every night that told me what i 
was going to be doing the next day he has made similar 
statements about his white house existence 
at his annual summertime party for the press in santa barbara 
he goes by the book entering the grounds and walking to a 
specified spot then taking a specified route through the crowd and 
going at a specified time to a bandstand to make offtherecord 
remarks 
his time is scheduled very precisely much more precisely than 
i would have ever thought says james c mckinney who came to 
the white house last year as director of the military office 
there was a book printed for the gorbachev visit and that ran 
only 2 days the book was approximately an inch thick a 
minutebyminute rundown of who goes where when who accompanies 
the president who rides in which elevator its the kind of a book 
that we get if we even go to make a speech in jacksonville fla 
to a bunch of high school kids 
when the american president travels the white house goes with 
him its set up in the biltmore hotel in santa barbara or in 
tokyo or venice 
you can get two helicopters on and get the ground crews for 
them on a c5a says gulley you also take a car a backup and 
a followup for secret service and in my time it took about 20 
communicators and 6000 pounds of communications equipment for each 
stop that would be whether he goes for 15 minutes or whether he 
goes overnight 
even if the president goes to a private dinner at the home of 
friends it takes a 15car motorcade with a cluster of military and 
security aides a doctor and other staff 
its usually no problem and people expect it says gary 
foster chief of press advance for the white house once in a 
while its an inconvenience its just that so many people come 
with him that sometimes they have a hard time knowing what to do 
with them 
wherever the president travels the army signal corps sets up 
its own telephone switchboard and installs special phones for all 
his aides 
no other country does exactly the same thing 
still some of the other leaders come fairly close 
when pope john paul ii travels abroad the vatican flies two 
bulletproof glassenclosed popemobiles ahead the pontiffs 
entourage numbers as many as 30 people including top prelates 
security men a valet and a photographer the pope does not have 
his own plane however he travels on chartered jets taking 
alitalia from rome and making the return leg on an airliner of the 
country he visited 
mikhail gorbachevs summit visit to washington in december gave 
americans a chance to compare the entourages of the us and soviet 
leaders 
i think there are an awful lot of parallels says mckinney 
their motorcade is even larger than ours i have never seen 
motorcades as large as the gorbachev motorcades the longest one 
was some 50 vehicles 
gorbachev took four ilyushin jetliners with him to washington 
kgb agents prevented a us television crew from filming the 
extensive wardrobe being rushed up the gangway for him and his wife 
although motorcades in moscow are usually only two or three 
cars special lanes are reserved for official cars and uniformed 
police often halt traffic for their passage members of an elite 
unit wearing electricblue shoulderboards guard the kremlin 
west german chancellor helmut kohl travels abroad on one of 
three boeing 707s reserved for top government officials there is 
no equivalent to air force one hanspeter gaertner a chancellery 
spokesman in bonn said no west german chancellor has ever taken a 
limousine abroad 
after the war konrad adenauer adopted a modest style that was 
suited to the time and since then other chancellors have followed 
suit gaertner says now that is what germans expect of their 
chancellors

france has a reputation for grandeur and the elysee palace 
provides one of the worlds most splendid presidential settings 
but things are simpler when mitterrand is traveling he usually 
flies in the supersonic concorde primarily as a plug for the 
french aerospace industry he gets around paris in a short 
motorcade and streets are blocked a few minutes before he is 
scheduled to pass he generally spends the night at his left bank 
apartment not in the palace on the right bank 
security around british prime minister margaret thatcher has 
increased since an irish republican army assassination attempt in 
1984 but is still slight compared with the ring around reagan 
she uses one of three lookalike official limousines at home 
but when abroad rides in either a british embassy limousine or one 
supplied by her hosts the prime ministers movements are no longer 
announced publicly in advance but members of the public are free 
to for example walk into a hotel where she is giving a speech 
as for the us president nixon white house aide john d 
ehrlichman in his book witness to power gave this summing 
up we wonder at the man in the white house who is so 
strangely different from the rest of us we fail to recognize that 
he is an animal which has been groomed to run a special race and 
has forgotten how to do almost everything else 
following a rigid schedule is nothing new to reagan who for the 
past 20 years has visited the same couple in palm springs calif 
over the new year holiday who during his annual california 
vacation in august routinely visits the same acquaintances in the 
same order on a trip to los angeles 
i think hes got a personality thats responsive to this type 
of thing says gulley who observes the white house now from the 
vantage point of a washington consultant 
even in the most rustic settings the trappings of power are 
there on one of their easter vacations the reagans helicoptered 
from their hardtoreach california ranch to a more accessible 
neighboring spread to join a motorcade to go to church 
as the helicopter landed a marine in dress uniform who flies 
on the copter to be ready to open the emergency exits if needed 
stepped out he was joined by other marines sent from quantico 
va as a ground crew also in dress blues for easter 
there they were the reagans off in the santa ynez mountains 
living the simple life the president so often extols the marines 
in their resplendent outfits standing at attention saluting 
smartly as the president and first lady made their way down a 
dusty tiretrack road to the limousine 
the founding fathers made one big mistake says political 
scientist barber they should have made ben franklin king and 
george washington prime minister so that he would have had some 
kind of royalty at the top to gather all of this emotion that now 
feeds into our white house all this ceremonial jazz 
on the other hand stephen hess a former eisenhower and nixon 
aide now with the brookings institution in washington said 
lets start with the proposition that presidents do get shot at 
and on occasion killed a lot of these trappings really have in 
part a protective purpose secondly the trappings of our country 
are really not only not out of line with other countries but in 
some regards quite modest the white house for example is 
relatively small compared with the mansions and the palaces that 
other heads of state live in so we do have to put that in some 
perspective 
in whatever perspective all this ceremonial jazz comes to an 
end for reagan in january when he steps aboard air force one for 
his last flight home to california then the country will see how 
the next president responds to it

just as it is for her husband life in public 
is for nancy reagan a preordained venture in which surprises are 
singularly unwelcome 
on a sightseeing tour at the 1987 economic summit in venice an 
aide makes an x in masking tape on a cobblestone to mark where 
nancy reagan should stop for photographers there are no similar 
marks for the mayor of venice or the wife of italys prime minister 
when she goes to harpers ferry wva to welcome a trainload 
of makebelieve comicstrip characters campaigning against drugs a 
sixperson advance team similar to the presidents but smaller 
precedes her by four days 
her traveling party on trips abroad includes her personal 
assistant hairdresser personal secretary photographer medic 
protocol officer and secret service agents 
she flies on an air force plane designated executive foxtrot 
one on a side trip from venice to sweden it was an air force 
boeing 707 outfitted to accommodate the first lady and 40 to 44 
other passengers as well as the pilots stewards and military 
communications personnel on other trips it is a smaller plane 
security doesnt really allow her to fly commercial says 
elaine crispen mrs reagans press secretary 
by contrast bess truman and her daughter margaret used to go 
from washington to independence mo by train paying for their 
own firstclass compartment lady bird johnson rode the eastern 
airlines shuttle on shopping trips to new york by the nixon 
administration however the presidential family was flying on 
government planes 
raisa gorbachev also gets some perks her clothes hats furs 
shoes and accouterments are something the average soviet woman can 
only dream about and although such information is not disclosed in 
the soviet union its doubtful that she pays for them it is known 
that she received gifts from paris couturiers during the couples 
official visit to france in 1985 she also has worn creations of 
soviet designer slava zaitsev 
a scene during margaret thatchers 1987 reelection campaign 
illustrates the difference in treatment of political spouses in 
england and the united states 
after the thatchers flying aboard a plane hired by the 
conservative party arrived at the packed manchester airport the 
prime minister plunged into the crowd but her husband denis 
became separated from her and spent about 10 minutes wandering 
around the fringes by himself it would not have happened to nancy 
reagan

editors note with so many experiments under way at the same 
time its difficult to pinpoint televisions birthplace among the 
cities that lay claim to tv firsts is schenectady ny there 
60 years ago a handful of viewers witnessed the first broadcast to 
television sets installed in the home 
</TEXT>

the flickering pink picture of a man 
playing a ukulele was a small miracle in an age of wonder all but 
forgotten beyond the town once known as the city that lights the 
world 
the year was 1928 and schenectady had grown from a sleepy 
hamlet on the erie canal to a booming factory town where the 
general electric co had its headquarters and its finest research 
talent 
for two years ernst fredrik werner alexanderson a consulting 
engineer for ge and the radio corporation of america had been 
tinkering with a machine that used perforated spinning disks to 
transmit pictures it was the mechanical ancestor of television 
on jan 13 1928 the first experimental television program was 
broadcast from the ge lab to the schenectady homes of alexanderson 
and two ge executives there scientists company officials and 
reporters gathered to peer into the pinkish light of a tiny screen 
3 inches square mounted in a cabinet 
the twohour program with simulcast radio sound began with a ge 
executive taking off his glasses and smoking a cigarette followed 
by a radio announcer strumming a ukulele and humming aint she 
sweet 
david sarnoff then vice president and later president of rca 
appeared on the program and called it an epochmaking 
development 
the event heralded another human conquest of space said a 
frontpage story in the new york times it was hailed as the 
first absolute proof of the possibility of connecting homes 
throughout the world by sight as they have already been connected 
by voice the article continued 
this year wrgb the schenectady station which claims that day 
as its birthday is celebrating with a series of parties and 
programs commemorating 60 years of television history 
were very proud of that heritage says terry walden wrgbs 
program manager and producer of a historical documentary on the 
station were the only station that can trace its history back 
that far 
actually the birthdate and birthplace of television are quite 
indistinct in history books television is one of the hardest 
areas to pinpoint firsts in says eliot sizowitch a specialist 
in radio and television history at the smithsonian institution 
there were just so many experiments going on at the same time 
independent american inventor charles francis jenkins produced 
the worlds first working television and demonstrated it in 
washington dc in 1925 a comedy skit was broadcast from new 
jersey to the bell telephone labs in new york city in april 1927 
westinghouse scientist vladimir zworykin developed the first 
electronic television system which ultimately replaced the 
mechanical scanners in the 1920s 
but the demonstration in january 1928 in schenectady apparently 
was the first broadcast to television sets installed in homes 
according to the reference book famous first facts 
the ge station was known as w2xb when it got its first federal 
license and started a regular program schedule in may 1928 with 
farm and weather reports three afternoons a week it was the 
worlds first regular television program schedule according to 
famous first facts 
from there wrgb boasts a series of firsts in television 
history it televised the first remote broadcast outside the 
studio with an august 1928 live telecast of gov alfred e smith 
accepting the democratic nomination for president at the state 
capitol in albany 
the following month the station televised the first play a 
bloodandguts drama called the queens messenger complete 
with props and sound effects 
at the time there were still only four households equipped with 
the 3inchscreen tv sets 
the first transatlantic telecast was made when the image of 
professor august carolus of leipzig germany was transmitted from 
schenectady to berlin in 1931 
in 1939 wrgb and wnbc in new york city were linked by a series 
of relay towers down through the catskill mountains and hudson 
valley thus forming the first television network the visit of the 
king and queen of england to the new york worlds fair in 1939 was 
beamed live to schenectady 
the worlds fair did more to publicize tv than anything 
else walden said in an interview at wrgbs 40000squarefoot 
studio complex in suburban niskayuna ge had a huge exhibit 
thousands of people went through and saw themselves on television 
for the first time 
wrgb which switched its network affiliation to cbs in 1981 
became the first nbc affiliate in 1939 it aired the first complete 
opera on tv in 1943 with a performance of hansel and gretel 
ernie tetrault anchorman of wrgbs evening news became the 
stations first fulltime staff announcer in 1951 his 37 years 
with wrgb make tetrault the longesttenured anchorman in the 
country says news manager gary whittaker 
there was little emphasis on news in the early days says 
tetrault it was pretty much ripandread we mainly depended on 
newsreel services and the associated press 
for example one day back in the 50s there was a big fire at 
the main ge plant right near the studio says tetrault our 
news manager looked out the window and said hey theres a fire 
at ge get ap on the phone and see if we can get something on it 
when wrgbs lone cameraman shot a story it took hours to 
process the film hed have to string it on sawhorses to dry 
says tetrault it would take all afternoon to do what takes 
minutes with modern video equipment 
now wrgb which has a dominant audience share in an area with 
four commercial stations and two public ones has all the latest 
newsgathering gadgetry including trucks for live remotes nine new 
electronic news cameras and sophisticated editing equipment 
freedom newspapers inc which bought the station for 57 
million in 1986 has pumped millions of dollars into the station 
and increased the staff to 125 from 100 says general manager david 
lynch

editors note contrary to its cartoon image the coyote is a 
cunning hunter blamed for annual losses of nearly 70 million worth 
of sheep long the bane of western farmers the coyote has migrated 
east filling an ecological niche created by elimination of a far 
less destructive predator the wolf 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the first sheep was killed on earl coles farm 
last march then another and another and another within 10 
months at least 80 lambs and ewes worth 10000 were slain on his 
farm and an adjoining one 
predatory teeth tore the sheeps throats or pierced their 
skulls and their soft inner organs were eaten all clues point to 
coyotes an old west predator whose numbers are growing in the east 
its circumstantial evidence nobodys actually seen a coyote 
kill the sheep but it pretty much has to be coyotes says cole 
67 who tends 100 head of sheep on his 200acre greene county farm 
to convince skeptics cole paid a trapper 50 to prove the 
coyotes existed 
five females have been trapped or shot near the scene of the 
crimes rolling pasture 60 miles south of pittsburgh as opposed 
to the high grassy plains of wyoming or montana 
thats good enough for richard belding land management officer 
for the pennsylvania game commission who calls the evidence 
overwhelming and conclusive 
before 1980 only six cases of coyotes killing sheep had been 
verified in pennsylvania the new runins with farmers are proof 
the coyote preceded by its mystique and villainous reputation has 
brought its eerie yips and howls to new territory 
a cousin of the wolf and the dog the coyote looks like a small 
german shepherd with a foxlike head pointed nose and bushy tail 
that resembles a bottle brush 
the eastern coyote has some wolf and dog genes and the biggest 
ones weigh 55 pounds its prairiedwelling kin weighs about 30 
pounds 
coyotes are cunning hunters bearing no resemblance to the 
hapless cartoon character wile e coyote whose comical schemes 
always backfire as he vainly chases a road runner 
real coyotes feast on mice rabbits deer carrion 
grasshoppers fruits and berries they also kill lambs calves 
goats chickens geese pigs barnyard cats llamas and other 
domestic livestock coyotes have pilfered watermelons on california 
farms in october coyotes killed 48 flamingos in the los angeles 
zoo after keepers mistakenly left the birds pen open 
coyotes vanished from pennsylvania 10000 years ago during the 
ice age they began returning in the late 1890s when the practice 
of clearcutting the states forest exterminated the wolf by 
destroying its habitat coyotes thrive in open country 
theyre filling an ecological niche created when we eliminated 
the wolf says dr john george a senior biologist at penn state 
university the coyote is very resourceful people have tried to 
poison them and trap them its tough to get rid of every last 
one 
there are coyotes in every eastern state says helen 
mcginnis who did her masters study on coyote populations at penn 
state the populations are building up and will continue to build 
up i have a lot of admiration for them theyre intelligent 
theyre adaptable 
biologists believe coyotes migrated from the great plains in a 
giant arc north and east around the great lakes about 90 years ago 
the route took them into ontario then south to new england new 
york pennsylvania and appalachia others pushed east from the 
plains while some were imported to be hunted by wolfhounds and 
sportsmen ms mcginnis says 
each year an estimated 1 million sheep or 10 percent of the 
national stock are killed by predators and coyotes account for 90 
percent of that according to the usda the loss is valued at 70 
million 
its our number one preventable loss this is the single 
largest cost of production that we think is reversible says dan 
murphy president of the washingtonbased national wool growers 
assocation 
the number of sheep ranchers has dwindled from 225000 in the 
1960s to 125000 says dr clair terrill former director of sheep 
research for the usda nationally the sheep population has fallen 
from 55 million during world war ii to 10 million says terrill 
who blames coyotes for much of the drop 
to promote the use of mutton idaho sheep farmers coined this 
bumper sticker eat american lamb 5 million coyotes cant be 
wrong 
others are more blunt 
i only know one good coyote and thats a dead coyote says 
rick moore of harrison county ohio where farmers pay a bounty of 
25 
don patterson president of sheep growers association in greene 
county pa calls coyotes a damned nuisance theyre taking 
money out of our pocket 
the coyote has outsmarted and outlasted government attempts to 
shoot trap and poison it into oblivion in 1972 the government 
banned poison baits on federal lands partly because nontarget 
animals were being killed 
in 1983 the government allowed farmers to use poison collars on 
sheep if they met two dozen restrictions to protect the 
environment so far the collars have been approved in wyoming 
montana and texas 
wildlife groups say the coyote is unfairly maligned attacking a 
sheep is a learned skill and not all coyotes kill livestock most 
avoid humans they also keep mice populations in check 
coyotes are opportunistic theyre not evil says susan 
hagood of defenders of wildlife a washingtonbased group with 
80000 members nationwide she says coyotes can be discouraged by 
guard dogs electric fences placing ewes in sheds when they lamb 
and selective shooting or trapping of sheep killers 
it would be a waste of time effort and money to try to 
eliminate them the government spent millions of dollars and failed 
to eradicate the coyote we would hate to see eastern states 
adopting western philosophies and making the same mistakes ms 
hagood says 
some states have studied the impact of coyotes on deer 
populations in maine selective trapping eliminates troublesome 
coyotes but the animals are not significantly damaging the deer 
herd 
as far as i know the coyote has not had any serious 
repercussions on native wildlife it does not appear to be a 
disaster if it is causing people problems people have themselves 
to blame says ronald novak of the us department of interior 
in pennsylvania where coyotes can be hunted or trapped 
yearround they number an estimated 2000 to 3000 
says arnold hayden a coyote expert with the pennsylvania game 
commission theyre probably everywhere but downtown philadelphia 
and pittsburgh

editors note the man who created gospel music is as obscure 
as his music is popular thomas dorsey is now 88 and bedridden in 
his chicago home a handful of gospel devotees are working to build 
a foundation that would preserve both his music and his memory 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
more than half a century ago thomas dorsey 
crossed the raw soulfulness of the blues with the sacred music of 
his youth to create a footstomping soulslapping sound that still 
fills black churches 
a personal conflict over his strict religious upbringing and 
love of the bawdy bluesy tunes inspired by slave songs led the 
young jazz pianist to create what he called gospel music 
now 88 bedridden in his chicago home and suffering from 
alzheimers disease dorsey is in danger of dying in obscurity his 
legend unknown by a generation of worshippers who revere his music 
but dont know his name 
he was the person who gave blacks a medium to keep their 
tradition alive says michael harris a professor of religion and 
african american studies at temple university in philadelphia and 
the author of a new biography on dorsey 
black church music before dorsey was very easygoing it wasnt 
upbeat it wasnt filled with a lot of rhythmic tones says bob 
storman a former gospel performer who with a handful of other 
aficionados is working to build a dorsey foundation in chicago 
it wasnt until the late 20s and 30s that a lot of ministers 
would let that kind of music into their church storman says 
the ministers figured that it was indecent and unreligious for 
them it was like some people react to acid rock music today 
dorseys song its tight like that hit the top of the blues 
charts about september 1928 harris says a number of people were 
very shocked to see the type of music they danced to the night 
before the next morning in church he says 
dorseys alltime greatest hit take my hand precious lord 
was the favorite song of the rev martin luther king and was 
popularized by the late mahalia jackson who once toured with 
dorsey it has been translated into more than 50 languages 
dorseys work includes more than 1000 gospel tunes and all 
would be displayed his wife kathryn said in an interview from 
the couples south side home 
i think he would think it was one of the greatest things that 
ever happened she said it would be the only one in the united 
states dedicated solely to dorsey she said 
but efforts to raise a halfmillion dollars for the foundation 
have faltered a chicago concert in december was to be the groups 
first fundraising event but it was canceled for lack of interest 
storman says that while people know dorseys music they dont 
know dorsey they confuse him with tommy dorsey the jazz 
bandleader of the 1940s 
in promoting thomas dorsey storman and colleagues have found 
that people thought we were talking about the jazz artist we had 
to remind people that tommy dorsey had passed tommy dorsey died 
in 1956 
thomas dorsey was born july 1 1899 just outside atlanta his 
father was sickly and he his mother and four siblings had to help 
support the family 
his mother was a very very religious woman who had been a 
profound influence on him says harris 
he became enamored of a resident pianist at a local theater 
then as a 12yearold boy he started playing in bordellos playing 
piano blues by that time he was supporting his family 
dorsey later began composing blues and playing jazz and blues 
piano he adopted the stage name georgia tom 
he began experimenting with gospel music as a way to reconcile 
an internal conflict over his religious upbringing and his early 
love of blues harris says 
as a young man dorsey moved to chicago and gradually began to 
concentrate on composing gospel music 
he was the first black man in america to publish gospel music 
in 1926 and started his own publishing firm at that time in 
chicago storman says 
he sent his first two gospel songs if you see my saviour 
and how about you to hundreds of churches not a single 
person ordered one harris says 
he spent time going from church to church trying to sell this 
the people thought it was blues an inappropriate kind of music for 
formal worship 
in 1931 dorsey was devastated by the deaths of his first wife 
and baby daughter in childbirth that was when he wrote his 
alltime great take my hand precious lord storman says 
and that was when he became totally dedicated to just doing 
gospel 
in january 1932 at ebenezer baptist church in chicago the rev 
j howard lorenzo smith hired dorsey to form a choir 
a month later at pilgrim baptist church the rev jc austin 
invited smith to preach an anniversary service harris says smith 
brought the choir and staid pilgrim baptist church went 
wild 
two days later austin offered dorsey the job of directing his 
church chorus 
i was a little boy then says the rev jc austin jr 
austins son and the current minister you couldnt get into the 
church the fire department came to keep the traffic moving 
every sunday morning 
under dorsey the choir gained national attention and he 
remained its director until the late 1970s when he retired 
dorsey a tall thin distinguishedlooking man was shrewd in 
his business dealings 
he was selftaught never went beyond third grade but he took 
this gospel thing and built his own publishing business out of 
it harris says 
dorsey sold his business in the early 1950s to new yorkbased 
chapel music which has continued to publish his music his 
attorney jay ross says 
dorsey also knew how to create music that performers want to 
sing 
theres no comparison to him hes in a class all by 
himself says gospel singer albertina walker 
the songs that he wrote they have such a meaning they 
have such a message people are forgetting dorsey but you really 
cant forget him he should be remembered as the father of gospel 
music the founder of gospel music

editors note the yellow river has been largely tamed by the 
chinese governments relentless dike and reservoirbuilding 
efforts but many still remember the day 50 years ago when a 
ruptured dike sent the waters cascading over village rooftops 
killing 890000 and leaving millions homeless 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
shi xiaoshan was just 5 years old when 
chinese nationalists broke the dike on the yellow river 50 years 
ago in a vain attempt to stop advancing japanese troops shi took 
refuge in a large floating pot 
the water was over the roofs in some villages shi recalls 
of the 1938 calamity that claimed an estimated 890000 lives and 
left millions homeless and without food shis family had to beg to 
survive 
today the retired worker lives quietly a short stroll away from 
that onceruptured dike confident neither man nor nature will ever 
again unleash the river known as chinas sorrow 
the 3388mile yellow river the cradle of chinese civilization 
and the bane of its existence has been largely tamed by relentless 
dike and reservoirbuilding efforts of the communist government 
since it took power in 1949 
but there remains an undercurrent of threat to the 110 million 
people who live along the banks of the worlds muddiest river 
nature does not change easily says chen xiande deputy 
director of the yellow river conservancy commission based in 
zhengzhou the capital of central chinas henan province 
the river begins in the remote plateaus of western qinghai 
province and winds through nine provinces before reaching bohai bay 
in shandong province over the past 2000 years it has flooded 
some 1500 times it has changed course 26 times in recorded 
history about once every century each time disrupting the lives 
of millions 
in 1887 when the river tore through its banks in henan 11 
large cities were inundated and a 50000squaremile area was under 
water for two months hundreds of thousands perhaps millions 
died 
there has been no major flood since 1946 largely because of a 
dikebuilding program comparable to the excavation of two panama 
canals chen says his 29000member commission has overseen the 
construction of seven of the 30 reservoirs that are planned to help 
control the river while supplying electrical power and irrigation 
to the barren riverside plains 
but he says his engineers have still made only small gains in 
controlling the flow of sandy yellowish sediment that gives the 
river its name and its unique power to destroy 
as the river courses southward from inner mongolia through the 
chalky and erosionpocked loess plateau of chinas midsection it 
deposits 16 billion tons of silt in its middle and lower reaches 
every year the riverbed in the lower reaches rises another 4 
inches creating what is called a suspended river where the 
water level is 13 to 23 feet above the surrounding land 
since 1949 the dikes have been heightened and reinforced three 
times to contain the rising waters the huge sanmenxia dam in 
western henan had to be rebuilt almost immediately after it was 
completed in the 1960s because engineers were fooled by the 
onslaught of silt 
the yellows powers of deception can be seen from atop the 
500yearold dikes north of zhengzhou breached by chiang kaisheks 
troops in 1938 and repaired in 1947 
the river channel is 6 miles wide but in the dry winter months 
the water is only several hundred yards across a faint glimmer far 
out over the frozen mud flats packed with silt from the loess 
plains of shaanxi province 600 miles to the northwest 
yet in the summer rainy season the entire channel is filled and 
after hard rain the waters pound against the 16foot high concrete 
embankments 
a new computerized warning system built with us and united 
nations assistance gives engineers 20 hours notice of a potential 
flood says yellow river conservancy commission senior engineer niu 
zengqi thats time enough to open sluices and fill waterretention 
reservoirs in the distant past news of impending floods came via 
horseback 
niu says the government has spent 13 billion since 1949 to 
harness the river and is now planning a new dam at xiaolangdi 
eastern henan that should reduce sediment buildup by 40 percent 
over 50 years 
there are other more visionary plans such as changing the 
course of the river largely discounted as too expensive and 
disruptive and linking the sluggish yellow with its slightly 
longer sister to the south the yangtze 
the idea is that the yangtze which carries far much more water 
than the yellow would help flush out the sediment on the yellows 
riverbed 
but deputy director chen stresses that most important is 
solving the sediment problem by soil conservation in the loess 
region without vegetation the problem of silt will only get 
worse 
china has used the waters of the river to irrigate more than 10 
million acres five times the amount of irrigated land in 1949 
but treeplantings and other antierosion campaigns still cover 
only about onefourth of the 172000 square miles of loess plateau 
that loses its fragile topsoil to the river 
engineer niu says hes sure deaths could be avoided if the 
waters rose to desperately high levels in the future but up to 1 
million people might have to be moved and 270 million in damages 
could be sustained if water has to be released into emergency 
retention areas 
along the river near zhengzhou where the soil was once too 
alkaline to produce anything but salt irrigation has made the rice 
paddies the most productive in henan 
i remember how afraid the peasants were when work began in 
1955 to open the dike for the irrigation gate says local 
resident shi they thought chairman mao was breaking the dikes 
just as chiang kaishek before him 
now i dont hate the river says 70yearold farmer cui 
xingxian who stood on the wall as the nationalist troops destroyed 
it in the past i feared the river but now i love it

it was 10 years ago that we first met the 
ewing family those oil barons of the southfork ranch and cbs 
dallas 
how times have changed and how dallas has changed 
few people today remember that the original star of dallas 
was pamela barnes ewing played by victoria principal and that her 
marriage to bobby ewing patrick duffy would give the show its 
theme of romeo and juliet the feuding barneses and the ewings 
would be the shows montagues and capulets it also had a dash of 
giant and peyton place tossed in 
it was even considered but only briefly that bobby would be 
killed in the fifth episode and it would be pam vs the family 
jr ewing played by larry hagman was a supporting character 
and his wife sue ellen linda gray was such a minor character 
she didnt even speak in the first show on april 2 1978 the 
script referred to her only as the brunette on the couch and 
didnt even identify her as jrs wife 
still hagman emerged with the meatiest role in the first show 
and he made the most of it he is deliciously wicked as he 
attempts to eject principal from the family bosom by any foul 
means a predebut story said 
writer david jacobs created the show with pamela as the focus 
this is a poor girl who marries into a rich family and her own 
familys enemy jacobs said in a 1978 interview 
dallas was actually a spinoff of knots landing although 
dallas got on the air first the dallas locale was picked 
because cbs and lorimar productions wanted to get away from the 
usual los angeles background 
it all seems like yesterday and a hundred years ago says 
leonard katzman the current executive producer he has been with 
the show since the beginning except for the season when both he and 
patrick duffy left the show he calls it the season that didnt 
exist because it was all passed off as pamelas dream when duffy 
returned 
he says there is some talk of putting together a retrospective 
of the shows 10 years during the summer for a special 
we came on in the spring with five shows he recalls as 
far as we knew thats all we were going to do then cbs picked us 
up for seven more shows then enough shows to complete the first 
full season we had a cliffhanger that year but nobody remembers 
it 
few remember the first cliffhanger in which sue ellen wrecked 
her car and you didnt know if she and her unborn baby would 
survive 
the second cliffhanger in 1980 caused a phenomenon around the 
world that was unprecedented in the history of television who 
shot jr was on the lips of millions upon millions of people 
from seattle to new york to london to paris 
by the time it was revealed that kristin had pulled the trigger 
dallas had climbed to no 1 in the nielsen ratings it reigned 
over the ratings for the next four years slipping once to second 
place until nbc overtook cbs as the firstplace network and the 
cosby show put the sitcoms back at the top of the ratings 
a less wellknown event of the summer of 1980 occurred when 
hagman asked lorimar to raise his salary to 100000 an episode 
lorimar not only refused but told hagman that jr could wake up in 
the hospital after plastic surgery and be robert culp 
hagman got the last laugh however katzman says he is by far 
the highest paid performer on television today and several other 
people on dallas are not too far behind he says 
dallas captured the interest of the audience katzman 
believes because there had never been a family like this on 
television before 
they were very wealthy but they had no airs he says jim 
davis was plain folks they fought with each other then made up 
plus we showed that you cant equate money with happiness 
dallas did not become a serial until its first full season 
sue ellen became pregnant and no one knew whether the father 
was jr or cliff barnes says katzman we carried that story 
for quite a while it caught on with the audience so we began 
doing more stories that ran from week to week 
we also found ourselves with the greatest character in 
television jr ewing its hard to say when he began to emerge 
but it was probably the end of the fifth show when pam lost her 
baby jr and pam had a fight in a hayloft and she fell and lost 
the baby at first he seemed contrite then you began to see how 
wicked he could be 
jim davis who played jock the patriarch of the ewings died in 
1981 
jim represented something weve never been able to 
recapture says katzman as bad as the boys could be if he 
walked into a room and told them to knock it off they did i think 
the audience responded to that strong head of the family and the 
warm woman barbara bel geddes as miss ellie at the other end of 
the table 
much of jrs motivation was looking good in his fathers 
eyes when jim died that motivation disappeared so we had to 
transfer it to his son after that when he did something terrible 
it was to build the empire for his son as his father had done for 
him 
others have left the series and returned donna reed replaced 
bel geddes as miss ellie when she had heart surgery charlene 
tilton who plays lucy ewing cooper left the show but returned 
this season patrick duffy quit in 1985 but returned after missing 
one season the famous season that disappeared as pams dream pam 
herself is now gone with the departure of victoria principal 
every departure shifted relationships without bobby jr had 
no one to hold him in check pamelas departure separates her 
brother cliff barnes ken kercheval from the ewings 
is dallas a soap opera or a spoof 
we play it straight although we sometimes take it to 
extremes katzman says weve never taken ourselves as 
seriously as some other shows knots landing is the most 
realitybased show we have our own reality but its a fictitious 
reality 
next season cbs and lorimar are considering a move away from 
the serial format either every story would begin and end within an 
episode or in the manner of la law and st elsewhere 
some storylines would be resolved and some would carry over a few 
weeks 
this show will last as long as the actors want to keep on 
doing it says katzman

hicks job doesnt end when the curtain goes up during the 
performance shes in the dressing room or the wings ready to do 
minor touchups 
as for crawford the makeup is with him for 12 hours on 
wednesdays and saturdays when he performs twice seven hours on 
the four days when he does just one show 
at the end of the show hicks applies vast amounts of mineral 
oil to remove the makeup which is peeled off gently so as not to 
irritate the skin 
there arent many makeup jobs in theater because nowadays 
actors learn to do their own makeup says hicks who grew up in 
surrey and moved to oxford before going to london to study at 
complexions the london school of makeup 
hicks met tucker the makeup designer when he spoke at the 
school he hired her to work on phantom it was her first job 
it was quite an extensive training period he put her 
through crawford says i remember him throwing all her brushes 
from college out the door and saying whats this girl you cant 
use this girl it was something out of dickens and i had to sit 
there absolutely quiet but it worked 
hicks adapted quickly to her onthejob training 
we had done a lot of this in theory at school but in practice 
i had never done it although i always wanted to get into prosthetic 
makeup she says 
the makeup design for phantom was first discussed during the 
summer of 1986 several months before the show opened in london at 
her majestys theater tucker scenic designer maria bjornson and 
crawford experimented with many different kinds of makeup they 
found they were limited by practical considerations 
there were restrictions not being able to cover the nose 
because of breathing or going inside the mouth too far because of 
the singing or covering the ears because it would interfere with 
listening to the music crawford says 
what the three of them came up with is what hicks tries to 
recapture at every performance 
its interesting people say how can you do the same show 
every day when youre an actor crawford says its exactly 
the same thing with the makeup its like painting every day is a 
challenge to paint that picture

little noticed by the rest of the world a 
guerrilla war in mozambique has created a new and serious refugee 
problem in africa along with its toll in human life and economic 
loss since it began in 1977 but it also is having a deep impact on 
mozambiques blackgoverned neighbors in southern africa and holds 
the seeds of an even wider regional conflict swallowing people 
already struggling with poverty and drought mozambique africas 
poorest nation is on the indian ocean and provides its black 
neighbors their only trading outlet except for nearby south 
africa but the neighbors efforts to cut their dependence on south 
africa for trade routes by using a corridor through mozambique have 
been disrupted by the guerrilla conflict the survival of 
mozambique is our survival prime minister robert mugabe of 
zimbabwe says the fall of mozambique certainly also will be our 
fall 
here are reports by associated press correspondents on how the 
war is affecting two of mozambiques closest neighbors

in the gnarled branches of ancient 
baobab trees hundreds of pelicans from mozambique peacefully nest 
giving rise to a local joke that even the birds have fled the civil 
war next door 
during one of the incessant deluges that turn the rich farmland 
into marshes this time of year manuel thomo and his family human 
refugees from the war in mozambique huddled around a camp fire 
beneath the branches of another baobab tree a temporary home for 
them and several other families 
ragclad and diseased hungry and frightened more than 400000 
mozambicans have crossed into neighboring malawi in the past 17 
months to escape fighting at home between guerrillas and the 
government 
the refugees have abandoned the poorest country in southern 
africa for refuge in the regions second poorest nation 
this is the major refugee problem in africa south of the 
sahara excluding sudan and somalia said raymond mkanda a 
tanzanian who heads the united nations high commission for refugees 
operation in malawi 
the pressure on the land is pretty heavy malawi doesnt have 
adequate land for its own people and the refugees are occupying 
land normally used for farming 
for generations mozambicans have been welcomed visitors across 
the 1000 miles of unguarded border they share with the malawians 
but fighting between government troops and the rebel mozambique 
national resistance more commonly known by the portuguese acronym 
renamo have sent waves of mozambicans fleeing into malawi 
mozambique gained independence from portugal in 1975 and has a 
government based on marxist theory 
the refugees have put a strain on malawian resources and caused 
security problems 
drought last year has forced malawi once one of the africas 
few food exporters to look elsewhere for food to feed its own 
people 
increasingly men suspected of being renamo fighters have 
crossed into malawi to steal livestock and relief rations from the 
refugees a cattle stealing raid in january ended with the deaths 
of three malawian villagers who resisted the raiders officials 
said they were the first malawian casualties of the crossborder 
intrusions which also have cost the lives of several mozambican 
refugees 
landlocked malawi is one of africas smallest and most densely 
populated countries nearly 8 million people in the country about 
the size of pennsylvania 
the un high commission for refugees estimates the number of 
mozambican refugees in malawi will reach a 500000 by the end of 
the year 
half a million refugees in a small country like malawi is a 
very big problem said ss kamvazina principal secretary in the 
ministry of health and the chairman of the joint committee 
responsible for the refugees care 
an estimated 330000 more mozambican war refugees are in nearby 
tanzania south africa swaziland zambia and zimbabwe according 
to the unhcr 
most of the refugees arrive with similar stories of abuse from 
both sides in the mozambican conflict 
government troops accuse civilians of collaborating with the 
rebels and take reprisals renamo fighters in turn frequently 
force villagers to carry supplies on long marches the civilians 
who falter or weaken are beaten or killed some of the refugees 
have charged 
some of the refugees take weeks wandering through the 
countryside to avoid fighting mkanda said 
for others its a short walk across an asphalt ribbon known as 
m1 malawis major northsouth road connecting the capital 
lilongwe with blantyre the countrys largest town 
for 60 miles m1 serves as the border between malawi and 
mozambique 
lush fields of maize corn and other crops crowd both sides of 
the road 
but while mud huts dot the landscape on the malawian side 
abandoned buildings and deserted huts line the mozambican side 
the former owners have fled taking tin from the roofs and 
windows from the buildings to use in build new homes on the malawi 
side of the road 
during the day some mozambicans venture across the road to work 
their old fields but never too far inland to risk running into a 
rebel or government patrol 
mozambicans living along m1 were among the first to flee the 
fighting that first mass movement in september 1986 brought 
40000 refugees to malawi three months later the number had 
nearly doubled and by march 1987 it reached 100000 
over the next 12 months the refugee population quadrupled 
its very difficult for the government to cope with the 
problem said kamvanzina the health ministry official we get 
no notice that tomorrow so many people are coming in 
more than 168000 mozambicans have settled here in the 
southernmost district of nsanje the largest refugee concentration 
refugees now outnumber the local population and the surrounding 
mountainsides are being denuded by the newcomers who fell trees for 
firewood and huts 
because of the influx as many as 100 a day it takes up to 10 
days for officials to build even temporary shelter for the new 
arrivals many of the refugees in the teeming camp near mangkokwe 
wear clothing fashioned from burlap sacks that once held their 
rations 
those who are coming in now are in terrible condition 
malnutrition no clothes tuberculosis said district 
commissioner geoff mwanja the chief government officer for nsanje 
war has reduced human beings to beasts if there was a way of 
ending this thing it would be very very nice 
the un refugee commission has budgeted 13 million for malawi 
in 1988 a seriously conservative figure mkanda said 
international aid has started to pour in including 12 million 
from the us agency for internationnal development 
repatriation is the most durable solution mkanda said 
nobody expects that soon 
they might be here for some time five years 10 years 
mkanda said even if there is change tomorrow in mozambique that 
doesnt mean that everybody will leave

a decade ago thousands of guerrillas 
flooded across the border from mozambique to mount a final assault 
against the whiteminority government in what then was call 
rhodesia 
today eight years after rhodesia became blackgoverned 
zimbabwe battalions of troops including guerrilla veterans of 
that independence war are strung along the same border this time 
to block a new wave of incursions by guerrillas fighting to 
overthrow mozambiques government 
the outcome of the guerrillas strikes in mozambique and inside 
zimbabwe will have a major impact on the fragile economies of the 
troubled region in southern africa 
several blackruled states are striving to divert their trade 
traffic from south africa to indian ocean ports in mozambique a 
former portuguese colony in a bid to loosen their economic 
dependency on the south africans 
the rebels in turn vow to continue sabotaging mozambiques 
supply lines that also serve malawi zaire zambia and zimbabwe 
so far the 12000 to 20000 guerrillas of the antigovernment 
mozambique national resistance seem unharried by the conventional 
forces ranged against them in mozambique and zimbabwe some 30000 
mozambican regulars more than 12000 zimbabweans 2000 tanzanians 
and a few hundred malawians 
the guerrillas who call themselves nationalists opposing a 
marxistbased government roam mozambiques 10 provinces and mount 
frequent raids into zimbabwe with virtual impunity 
its very strange being on the other side said a young 
zimbabwean corporal who fought the rhodesians under the name 
comrade hammer 
we know from our experience its hard to beat guerrillas but 
these people are just bandits and at least we know exactly how they 
think and what they might do next 
the guerrillas known by the portuguese acronym renamo 
originally were formed by the rhodesian intelligence service in 
1977 two years after mozambiques independence from portugal to 
harass nationalist guerrillas directed by robert mugabe from inside 
mozambique during zimbabwes 197379 independence war 
mugabe became zimbabwes prime minister at independence from 
britain in april 1980 and cut support to the mozambican rebels but 
south africa took over the reins until 1984 when it signed a 
nonaggression pact with mozambique since then mozambique claims 
south african support has continued a charge denied by the south 
african government 
the mozambican rebels declared war on zimbabwe last year after 
mugabe vowed that a quarter of his forces stationed in mozambique 
would fight to keep its government in power 
since then they have stepped up raids along the 750mile 
frontier of forested mountains and scrubdotted plains 
rebels have killed scores of villagers and some securityforce 
militias they have abducted hundreds of civilians including 
children and marched them at gunpoint into mozambique apparently 
as dragooned recruits 
they also have destroyed government schools clinics and 
development projects robbed country stores and remote homesteads 
of food drink and clothing ambushed buses and looted passengers 
ordered workers to leave forestry estates coffee plantations and 
orchards rustled cattle sheep and goats 
mugabe has exhorted his troops to erect an impassable defense 
along our border to prevent fresh incursions 
he also urged them to renew military efforts inside mozambique 
to completely deny the enemy any chance to sabotage our 
arteries to the sea 
lt col solomon mujuru a wartime guerrilla chieftain and now 
zimbabwes army commander called on civilians living along the 
frontier to report people they suspect might have links to the 
guerrillas 
but mujuru said zimbabwean troops had gained the upper hand in 
counterinsurgency operations since the first major incursions eight 
months ago 
before june mujurus soldiers and the rebels clashed only in 
mozambique 
since then troops of zimbabwes new 5000member 6th brigade 
have reinforced border defenses militias are guarding farms 
villages schools and clinics and crossborder movement has been 
banned except at established immigration posts 
antipersonnel mines have been sown where guerrillas are thought 
to cross into zimbabwqe and the identification papers of some 
65000 mozambican refugees in three camps are being screened by 
local authorities and the united nations high commission for 
refugees 
in addition courts have cracked down on local peasants 
suspected of links to the insurgents early in february a mutare 
judge sent a woman to prison for six years and a man for five years 
for failing to report the presence of bandits to officials 
at stake in the conflict is not only the survival of mozambique 
its economy already in ruins as a result of fighting and famine 
also at issue is the fate of the socalled beira corridor a 
186mile trade route that meanders through mountains fertile 
valleys and swamps from the zimbabwean border city to the indian 
ocean port of beira in mozambique 
a fifth of the overseas trade of the blackruled neighbor states 
flows along the corridors railroads and highways landlocked 
zimbabwe receives most of its fuel suppliers from a corridor 
pipeline despite repeated sabotage by the guerrillas most of that 
trade and oil previously went through south africa 
both mugabe and president joaquim chissano of mozambique have 
rejected suggestions that they hold peace talks with the 
guerrillas arguing that the rebels are puppets of south africas 
government and have no support from either the east or the west 
mugabe at the graduation ceremony for the 6th brigade in 
september said he was forced to form the unit because of what he 
called south african destabilization in the region 
south africas subversion of mozambiques sovereignity had 
the potential to completely deny us any routes to the sea mugabe 
said 
the survival of mozambique is our survival mugabe said 
the fall of mozambique certainly also will be our fall

the nation that wants to turn the indian 
ocean into a zone of peace has just acquired a nuclear 
submarine to add to its two aircraft carriers and 110 other naval 
vessels 
indias acquisition last month of the nuclear submarine from the 
soviet union is part of a naval expansion since failing in its 
efforts of almost 20 years to clear the indian ocean of bigpower 
navies 
the expansion has aroused criticism from neighboring pakistan 
and the united states which has warships in the ocean along with 
the soviet union britain and france 
within the past two years india also has acquired five 
conventional submarines its second aircraft carrier and at least 
five indianbuilt navy ships 
it has plans to buy more including possibly other soviet 
nuclear subs and to build warships ranging from submarines to 
another aircraft carrier for its fleet 
its the full range of naval warfare theyre building a 
firstclass navy a western naval analyst said 
when the 47000member indian navy got the carrier hermes from 
britain last year and renamed it viraat imposing the chief of 
naval staff at the time adm rh tahiliani said we finally 
have a roundtheclock blue deep water navy 
while greater naval strength seems to belie indias pleas before 
the united nations for a zone of peace in the indian ocean it 
matches the countrys growing might 
india also has a 1millionman army the worlds fourth largest 
and is acquiring modern weapons 
each step up however is ascribed to the need to match the 
growing arsenals of others chiefly neighboring rivals pakistan and 
china but also the western powers 
the strategies of outside powers in our region have forced 
upon us expenditure in building military strength which we would 
much rather have deployed for the removal of poverty prime 
minister rajiv gandhi said as the nuclear sub chakra was 
commissioned 
the indian ocean has been militarized and infested with 
nuclear weapons flouting the overwhelming sentiment within the 
region in favor of establishing a zone of peace 
india first proposed a zone of peace for the indian ocean in the 
early 1970s and the nonaligned movement third world endorsed 
the concept the proposal then went to the un general assembly 
which in 1971 adopted a declaration calling for a peace zone and 
urging the dismantling of big powers air and naval bases in the 
indian ocean but a planned un conference on the issue has never 
been held although a committee has been meeting in hopes of 
bringing one about by 1990 
the soviet union has endorsed the idea but the united states 
has not 
indias naval buildup initially was attributed to the 
development of a us navy base in the early 1980s at diego garcia 
an island in the chagos archipelago about 1000 miles southwest of 
india 
an indian naval expert speaking on condition of anonymity said 
he did not believe his nation faces a real threat from us or 
other western ships protecting oil shipping in the persian gulf 
but he added if you have troubled waters close to home you 
think about what you might have to do 
he said india believed more sea power was needed to protect its 
4937 miles of coastline and to keep a competitive edge in naval 
technology 
of the newly acquired nuclear sub he said its a system 
without which a navy is not viable it takes the game to a new step 
altogether 
prime minister mohammad khan junejo of pakistan has condemned 
the acquisition of the sub as an escalation of the military buildup 
in the region press reports say pakistan with no nuclear 
submarine is pressing the united states for p3 antisubmarine 
aircraft 
us state department spokesman charles redman has said indias 
acquisition of a nuclear sub clearly introduces a new weapons 
technology into the south asian region 
the united states is opposed to india having a nuclear submarine 
because of a lack of safeguards redman added 
neither india nor pakistan has signed the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty india exploded a nuclear device in 1974 
and pakistan is thought to be on the verge of developing nuclear 
weapons both nations say their nuclear plans are peaceful in 
design 
the new chakra submarine for the moment leased by the soviets 
to the indian navy is not believed to carry nuclear weapons 
the western naval analyst who insisted his name not be used 
said the charlie i class sub is 1960s technology its an old 
boat 
indias second aircraft carrier the viraat was originally 
commissioned in 1959 and the western expert noted that india 
does not have enough planes for one carrier let alone two 
india however is buying british sea harrier aircraft and sea 
king commando helicopters for its carriers 
it also has bought three late1970s vintage kilo class soviet 
submarines and two west german hdw 209s called search and kill 
subs to update its fleet of eight sovietmade foxtrot subs 
in addition india is upgrading its three shipyards to build 
warships and constructing its largest naval base near karwar 285 
miles south of bombay on the west coast 
there are reports the navy is expanding an existing base on its 
farflung nicobar islands 1035 miles from the countrys southern 
tip but only about 100 miles from indonesia 
the indian naval expert saw these developments in light of 
indias need to protect itself 
you need military power for your own security not that you 
have expansionist ambitions he said 
his western counterpart said indias rationale for an expanding 
navy was its view of itself as the regional power of south asia 
indian navy men also see themselves as heirs to british sea 
power from the days when britain controlled the indian ocean to 
protects its trade routes to asia the western analyst said 
they want a navy they can operate throughout the indian 
ocean he said the brits were there before they want to be 
there too

wednesday is the 20th anniversary of the 
massacre of civilians by us troops at the vietnamese village of 
my lai the writer who covered the vietnam war as an associated 
press correspondent for 10 years and was the aps last saigon

ended and visited my lai in december 1984

at 722 on a saturday morning 20 years ago charlie company 
lifted off in helicopters with rifles on their arms and revenge in 
their hearts the infantrymen were on a mission to my lai that 
would become synonymous with shame and coverup 
two minutes after they were airborne on that day march 16 
1968 us artillery guns firing in support from landing zone 
uptight indiscriminately shelled the village helicopter gunships 
raked the landing zone with rockets and machine gun fire 
the thundering artillery the whistling rockets and the steady 
clatter of machine guns sent villagers who had been working in the 
rice paddies diving for cover along the dikes and in the buffalo 
pits in the fields others like pham thi trinh then a 10yearold 
schoolgirl and her family took refuge in homemade shelters in 
front of their huts 
as the troopcarrying helicopters from task force barker made 
their final approach smoke from fires touched off by the artillery 
poured into the skies at 730 the first troops landed aroused 
about a grudge operation aimed at evening the score for the 
american casualties suffered from mines booby traps and snipers 
the attitude of all the men the majority i would say was a 
revengeful attitude said gregory olson in testimony at a 
military inquiry into the my lai assault they all felt a little 
bad because we lost a number of buddies to may lai 
people were talking about killing everything that moved 
recalled another participant robert pendleton everyone knew 
what we were going to do 
they had been briefed the day before on their target the 48th 
viet cong local force battalion perhaps as many as 250 troops that 
intelligence said posed a threat to the provincial capital of quang 
ngai city 6 miles away their mission to destroy their supply base 
and staging area 
when we left the briefing we felt we were going to have a lot 
of resistance and we knew we were supposed to kill everyone in the 
village recalled william lloyd 
capt ernest l medina the commander of charlie company told 
his troops the civilians would be on their way to the local 
marketplaces in quang ngai city by 7 am but that was not the case 
charlie companys 1st platoon led by lt william l calley 
jr moved into my lai firing at fleeing vietnamese throwing 
grenades into houses and bunkers and slaughtering animals 
we heard the sound of american soldiers pham thi trinh told 
a reporter years later people hiding in the shelter got out as 
they usually did when americans entered the village the us 
troops ordered her family and four neighbors to the front of the 
house she said she hid in a bedroom 
they shot to death three cows first she said then they 
knelt and shot my family people tried to run away my parents six 
brothers and sisters grandmother and aunt and uncle were killed 
after shooting her mother she said the americans placed straw 
on the woman and lighted it she said that when her 14yearold 
sister ran from the burning kitchen of their home laughing 
soldiers forced her back into the fire pham thi trinh ran to her 
76yearold grandmothers house and found her body partly inside a 
clothes cupboard where she had tried to hide 
vo thi lien then 11 was in a shelter with her grandparents 
i saw three american soldiers point guns and shoot into the 
shelter and then throw grenades into it and hit my grandmother 
she said numbed and unable to find a way out of the collapsing 
shelter she and her grandfather finally were rescued by some 
villagers 
by the time charlie company left my lai in the early afternoon 
its troops had killed at least 175200 vietnamese men women and 
children according to the 1970 report of the army inquiry headed 
by the late lt gen william r peers 
the evidence indicates that only three or four were confirmed 
as viet cong although there were undoubtedly several unarmed viet 
cong men women and children among them and many more active 
supporters and sympathizers the peers report said 
separate estimates by the criminal investigation division of the 
army together with other evidence indicated more than 400 civilians 
were killed 
a plaque in my lai is inscribed with the names of 504 men women 
and children vietnamese officials say died in the massacre 
the only american casualty reported in charlie company was a 
soldier who was wounded by the discharge of his rifle 
members of calleys platoon testified before the peers inquiry 
that an old man was bayoneted to death and another man was thrown 
alive into a well and killed with a hand grenade 
of calley the central figure of my lai the peers report said 
he directed and supervised the men of his platoon in the 
systematic killing of many noncombatants in and around my lai he 
personally participated in the killing of some noncombatants 
of the leader of the 2nd platoon lt steven k brooks one of 
four officers involved in may lai who were killed in action in the 
following months the report said he directed and supervised the 
men of his platoon in the systematic killing of at least 60 to 70 
noncombatants although he knew that a number of his men 
habitually raped vietnamese women in villages during operations on 
16 march 1968 he observed did not prevent and failed to report 
several rapes by members of his platoon while in my lai and 
binh tay 
some vietnamese were spared by the courage of an american 
helicopter pilot who threatened to fire on his fellow soldiers if 
they harmed a group of 12 to 16 vietnamese women children and old 
men cowering in a bunker 
warrant officer hugh thompson landed his helicopter near the 
bunker and ordered his crew to fire on the american infantrymen if 
they fired on the vietnamese while he was trying to get them 
evacuated 
thompson said he asked a lieutenant to help get the women and 
children out and the infantry officer replied that the only way to 
get them out was with a hand grenade thompson snapped back at the 
lieutenant just hold your men right where they are and ill get 
the kids out the vietnamese were safely evacuated

the outside world knew nothing of my lai for more than a year 
the peers inquiry cited 28 officers ranging from generals to 
enlisted men for covering up the massacre 
on march 29 1969 ron ridenhour a vietnam veteran sent 
letters to 30 military and congressional leaders saying he had 
heard many reports from soldiers who had served in charlie company 
that something very black had happened in my lai and a public 
investigation should be made 
eight months later on nov 24 1969 calley was ordered 
courtmartialed on charges of premeditated murder of 109 vietnamese 
if i have committed a crime calley said in his defense 
the only crime that i have committed is in judgment of my values 
apparently i have valued my troops lives more than i did that of 
the enemy when my troops were getting massacred and mauled by an 
enemy i couldnt see i couldnt feel and i couldnt touch that 
nobody in the military ever described as anything other than 
communism 
they didnt give it a race they didnt give it a sex they 
didnt give it an age they never let me believe it was just a 
philosophy in a mans mind that was my enemy out there and when it 
came between me and that enemy i had to value the lives of my 
troops and i feel that is the only crime i have committed 
in march 1971 a jury of six senior officers convicted calley of 
firstdegree murder of at least 22 villagers including a boy 
fleeing in terror whom calley tossed into a ditch and shot 
calley was ordered to spend life in prison 
his conviction and sentence touched off a public outcry in his 
support including national petition campaigns angry speeches in 
congress and appeals to president richard nixon to pardon him five 
months later nixon reduced his sentence to 20 years 
calley actually served three years under house arrest at fort 
benning ga he was released when his conviction was overturned by 
a federal district judge and he was not returned to house arrest 
when the 5th us court of appeals reinstated the conviction 
calley was the only soldier convicted in the my lai massacre 
but it became the graveyard for several army careers 
initially 25 officers and enlisted men were charged 13 of them 
accused of direct involvement in the killing but only six were 
actually tried including medina the company commander 
the highest ranking officer tried col oran k henderson 
commander of the 11th infantry brigade of which charlie company 
was a part was acquitted of charges of failing to conduct an 
investigation after he was told civilians had been killed 
administrative action was taken against two generals one of 
them demoted and the other censured 
the peers report said no single factor by itself was the cause 
of my lai 
the battle plan by lt col frank a barker commander of the 
task force bearing his name contained inaccurate intelligence on 
the strength and whereabouts of the viet cong and wrongly assumed 
no civilians would be in the area the report said it said barker 
and his subordinates failed to make any clear distinction between 
soldiers and civilians 
barker was killed in a helicopter crash three months later 
the report said many men in charlie company disliked and 
mistreated vietnamese civilians and did not trust them because they 
failed to warn the americans of mines and booby traps which took a 
heavy toll of casualties frustrating and demoralizing the us 
troops 
another contributing factor the report said was the attitude 
of south vietnamese officials themselves toward the my lai area 
which they considered viet congcontrolled territory and treated as 
a free fire zone with little concern about the villagers this 
attitude rubbed off on the americans the report said 
although atrocities were committed by both sides in the vietnam 
war my lai shocked the united states a nation that took pride in 
fighting by the rules of war 
today my lai is a memorial to its victims the bodies of the 
men women and children rest in the cemeteries and surrounding 
fields 
in the center of the village is a large statue of a woman 
holding a child in her left arm at her feet are victims of the 
massacre 
my lai was reborn when the war ended in 1975 twenty years after 
the attack it is alive again with the scent of flowers in bloom 
and the laughter of a new generation of children

a score of springs have come and gone for paul meadlo since he 
left vietnam but time has not dulled his memory of my lai 
i got a permanent reminder said meadlo in a telephone 
interview from his home in terre haute ind i got my foot blowed 
off the very next morning it must have been gods plan 
meadlo was a 21yearold rifleman on march 16 1968 when 
charlie company swept through the village of my lai and killed at 
least 175200 men women and children 
granted immunity he testified at the courtmartial of his 
platoon leader lt william l calley jr that he helped calley 
shoot some of them because as far as he was concerned they were 
viet cong 
its just something youve got to live with he said its 
rough eventually you just got to cross it out of your mind and go 
on with your life 
meadlo now 41 said that when he first left the army it was 
hard to get a job because of the loss of his right foot to a mine 
im still bitter about this forever 
he eventually landed a job with a company that makes plastic 
film and has been there nearly 20 years he has a 20yearold son 
and a 19yearold daughter both of whom are in the army 
four other men involved in my lai were killed in action in the 
months afterward including lt col frank a barker of new haven 
conn who planned the operation 
like meadlo my lai left its imprint on the others who survived 
and forever changed their lives 
for ernest medina the commander of charlie company it meant 
the end of an army career 
i had to resign my commission and get out setting aside 16 
years service medina told the associated press recently even 
though he was acquitted in a courtmartial his career was ruined 
medina moved with his wife and three children to marinette 
wis in 1971 he worked as a salesman for a helicopter 
manufacturer for a time but for 10 years has been in the real 
estate business his two youngest sons are in the service 
now 51 medina looks back on my lai as a horrendous thing 
that never should have happened 
i have regrets for it but i have no guilt over it because i 
didnt cause it he said thats not what the military 
particularly the united states army is trained for 
but then again maybe the war should have never happened he 
said i think if everybody were to look at it in hindsight im 
sure a lot of the politicians and generals would think of it 
otherwise maybe it was a war that we should have probably never 
gotten involved in as deeply as we did without the will to win it 
medina said that in looking for the cause of my lai there is a 
need to look at the whole vietnam war 
its just totally different he said there were no front 
lines it wasnt a conventional type war it was a guerrilla war 
its something i feel a lot of draftees were not trained for a lot 
of the officers were not trained im talking not just about 
lieutenants im talking about senior officers 
another soldier who was courtmartialed and acquitted charles 
hutto now lives with his family in monroe la where he works as 
a television repairman now 39 he was a 19yearold sergeant at my 
lai 
asked the lessons of my lai he said give young boys time to 
grow up mentally before you send them to fight a war 
hutto said he has overcome a drinking problem that developed as 
he tried to cope with what happened in my life during that time 
and wondering how come it didnt happen to someone else i was at 
the wrong place at the wrong time 
calley the central figure in my lai declined to talk to a 
reporter maintaining the silence he has kept over the years now 
44 he works in columbus ga with his fatherinlaw vv vick 
owner of a jewelry store 
calley the only soldier convicted in the case served three 
years under house arrest at fort benning ga 
the man who exposed my lai ron ridenhour was never there now 
41 he is an investigative reporter for citybusiness a biweekly 
newspaper in new orleans he recently won a polk award for local 
reporting for a yearlong investigation of a city tax scandal 
but 20 years ago he was a door gunner on an observation 
helicopter that flew over the village a few days after the 
massacre it was his conscience that drove him to blow the whistle 
but he waited for several months until he was out of the service 
because he feared for his life 
he learned what had happened at my lai a month later when he was 
transferred to a longrange reconnaissance patrol and was reunited 
with half a dozen of his friends from training camp who had been at 
the village with charlie company they told him the story 
in march of 1969 four months after his discharge he sent 
letters to 30 military and congressional leaders detailing what he 
had been told 
theres no question i had to turn in my friends he said 
but it was that or be part of their crime i believe though 
that they are also victims that maybe carried the brunt of of what 
was really an official policy i dont regret it it exposed the 
truth i didnt think people had massacres like my lai in mind when 
they supported the war in vietnam

italian tire manufacturer pirelli today 
launched a 186 billion offer for firestone tire and rubber co 
complicating firestones plan to sell 75 percent of its tiremaking 
division to bridgestone of japan 
pirelli in an advertisement in the wall street journal offered 
58 a share cash for all 32 million firestone common shares 
outstanding 
pirelli said in a statement today its offer was conditioned on 
acquiring at least twothirds of firestones shares on the 
agreement beween firestone and bridgestone not being signed and on 
the removal of firestones antitakeover defenses 
we wont have anything more to say until the board has had an 
opportunity to make a review i would expect that would begin 
immediately firestone spokesman robert troyer told the akron 
beacon journal on sunday in a telephone interview from chicago 
home of firestones corporate headquarters 
an acquisition of firestone would substantially increase 
pirellis current 15 percent share of the us tire market the 
worlds largest it would also give the italian company its first 
manufacturing facilities in the united states 
wall street analysts had speculated on thursday that pirelli 
would make an offer for firestone 
firestones stock leaped 1137 a share in early trading today 
to 61 a share above pirellis 58ashare offer indicating that 
speculators expected an even higher offer to emerge 
firestone stock closed at 4962 friday up 550 for the week 
in heavy trading nearly 42 million shares of firestones common 
stock changed hands last week compared with about 850000 in an 
average week 
it was not immediately clear what effect an investment or 
takeover attempt by pirelli would have on the pending proposed 
joint venture between firestone and bridgestone corp firestones 
board and ultimately shareholders will have to decide which offer 
to accept 
pirelli could block the bridgestone deal if it was able to 
purchase a sufficient number of firestone shares 
pirelli said today that if it was successful in its bid for 
firestone it would spin off parts of the company to the french 
group michelin 
michelin would pay about 650 million to acquire firestones 
brazilian holdings as well as master care inc firestones us 
service company pirelli said 
michelin would also have an option to buy 50 percent of 
firestones synthetic rubber and diversified product holdings in 
the united states for about 150 million 
on feb 16 bridgestone and firestone said they intended to form 
a new akronbased tire business to be called firestone tire co 
that would own firestones worldwide tire manufacturing operation 
bridgestone would own 75 percent of the joint venture 
firestone chairman john j nevin has said the company wants to 
distribute to shareholders a very substantial portion of about 
1 billion in cash that would be generated by the joint venture 
firestone has been considered an attractive target for both 
foreignbased companies because of their interest in gaining us 
market share 
troyer said bridgestone officials were notified upon learning of 
possible action by pirelli on sunday 
at the time the 15 billion bridgestone deal was announced 
firestones board approved an antitakeover measure that took 
effect tuesday 
that measure would raise the cost of a takeover by creating a 
special class of preferred stock in the event an individual or 
group acquired 20 percent or more or made a tender offer for 20 
percent or more of firestones stock without approval of the board 
in a letter to shareholders released last week nevin said the 
antitakeover plan was not intended to prevent a fair offer for the 
shares of the company and should not deter anyone from acquiring 
the company if the buyer gives shareholders full value and 
negotiates in good faith 
pirelli headquartered in milan had sales of 365 billion last 
year

the supreme court today agreed to hear a 
reagan administration appeal aimed at allowing the government to 
take a bigger tax bite out of some corporate mergers 
the court said it will review a ruling stemming from the 
acquisition of a small west virginia company by a corporation 
traded on the new york stock exchange 
the smaller company basin surveys inc was owned by donald e 
clark of buckhannon wva it provides services to the petroleum 
industry 
clark sold the business in 1979 to nl industries of new york 
which produces petroleum equipment chemicals and metals 
nl industries gave clark 300000 shares of its stock and 325 
million to acquire basin surveys 
at issue in the case was whether the cash payment commonly 
called boot should be taxed as a capital gain or considered a 
dividend and taxed as ordinary income generally the capital gain 
tax rate is lower 
the tax reform bill enacted in 1986 eliminated the different tax 
rates for capital gains and ordinary income 
but the administration said the different treatment will still 
apply to some corporate shareholders 
also in urging the court to consider the government appeal 
justice department lawyers said congress sometime in the future 
might restore for all taxpayers the different treatment of ordinary 
income and capital gains 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled in favor of clark 
last september sparing him from paying 972505 in taxes 
the appeals court said we regard the boot as a cash payment 
by nl in return for clarks relinquishment of a portion of his 
interest in the newly reorganized corporation because clark 
surrendered more than 20 percent of his interest in nl he is 
entitled to capital gain treatment 
the appeals court arrived at the 20 percent figure by noting 
that nl industries offere clark two choices in the merger he 
could receive either 425000 shares of nl stock or 300000 shares 
plus 325 million in cash 
the appeals court said clark by choosing the latter option in 
effect gave up more than 20 percent of his interest in nl 
industries in return for the cash 
the appeals court said that under federal law a shareholder who 
relinquishes more than 20 percent of his corporate control and is 
less than a 50 percent shareholder after the transaction is 
entitled to have cash proceeds from the transaction treated as 
capital gains 
justice department lawyers said the ruling is in conflict with 
decisions by other federal appeals courts they said the supreme 
court should eliminate the confusion 
the case is commissioner of internal revenue vs clark 871168

manufacturers hanover corp wounded from 
possibly uncollectable third world loans is seeking to sell its 
profitable consumer finance unit to raise capital the wall street 
journal reported monday 
quoting banking sources it did not identify the newspaper said 
the nations sixthlargest banking concern is asking between 500 
million and 600 million for huntingdon valley pabased 
manufacturers hanover consumer services inc which has about 3 
billion in assets 
the banking company has been forced to take austerity measures 
because of a 114 billion loss last year due mainly to a 17 
billion addition to reserves that reflected the questionable 
collectability of some third world loans a problem afflicting many 
american banks 
john meyers a manufacturers hanover spokesman in new york said 
he could not comment on the journal report but he said the bank 
has consistently stated it would rebuild capital partly via 
property sales and expense cuts 
weve said all along there is a host of assets we can realize 
gains on meyers said it is part of our game plan to get 
shareholder equity replenished 
banking industry analysts have said manufacturers hanovers 
consumer finance business is considered highly prized and 
profitable within the company so a sale would reflect on the 
seriousness of the banks capital needs 
on the other hand the consumer finance unit is a standalone 
operation so it could be sold much more easily that other company 
property

production in the us paper industry appears 
poised for a third consecutive recordbreaking year as demand 
remains strong for all major grades of paper and paperboard an 
industry trade association said monday 
the american paper institute a trade association for american 
pulp paper and paperboard companies said production is running at 
a rate of 75 million tons a year or about 3 percent above its pace 
at the same point last year 
production for all of 1987 amounted to a record 744 million 
tons up from 709 million tons in 1986 and is expected to rise by 
about 2 percent in 1988 according to figures supplied by the trade 
association 
the groups forecast was released as it began its national 
conference 
the institutes president red cavaney said the forecast for 
1988 presumes avoiding a recession a progrowth trade policy a 
fairly low interest rate climate and no major tax increases 
last year was also a record in terms of the dollar value of 
paper and paperboard sales the group said it said it expects 
final figures for 1987 will show sales of about 87 billion or 16 
percent more than the previous high of 748 billion set in 1986 
the paper industry derived its strength in 1987 from heightened 
demand in the various markets its serves the institute said 
demand for white papers for instance reflected trends such as 
increased use of office copy and computer printout papers and of 
envelopes 
strength in directmail advertising helped fuel robust growth in 
commercial printing stimulating printing paper demand the paper 
institute said 
paperboard production set a record last year as packaged goods 
production surged triggering increased demand for paper used for 
shipping containers folding cartons and fiber cans the institute 
said 
newspapers and the high quality colorprinted advertising pieces 
that retailers and businesses use to reach their customers 
performed strongly in 1987 the group said pushing newsprint 
production to a new high last year

businesses that lose money from the sale of 
stock arent entitled to special tax breaks no matter why the stock 
was purchased the supreme court decided today 
the court voting 80 ruled against an arkansas conglomerate 
that sought to claim as an ordinaryloss deduction for federal tax 
purposes a 10 million loss from the sale of stock in a texas bank 
it once controlled 
arkansas best corp of fort smith in 1969 had acquired more than 
65 percent of the stock of national bank of commerce the fourth 
largest bank in dallas 
congress passed a law in 1970 that prohibited conglomerates that 
owned a bank from expanding their nonbank business through new 
acquisitions in other industries 
arkansas best which owns trucking furniture manufacturing 
data processing and other businesses decided to divest itself of 
the bank stock the 1970 law gave it 10 years to sell the bank 
stock 
because of public awareness that arkansas best was under legal 
obligation to divest itself disposing of the bank stock without 
taking a big loss was difficult 
at the same time the banks finances were deteriorating 
arkansas best therefore acquired additional stock in the bank in an 
attempt to keep it solvent 
the conglomerate began selling off the bank stock in 1975 and 
sought to claim the losses as ordinary losses rather than capital 
losses a tax advantage 
the internal revenue service ruled that the losses suffered by 
arkansas best were capital losses the irs rejected arkansas bests 
arguments that the stock was not bought for typical investment 
purposes but for business purposes and therefore its sale should 
yield ordinary losses 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals agreed with the irs but 
other federal appeals courts had reached conflicting conclusions 
writing for the high court today justice thurgood marshall said 
motivation behind the stock purchase is irrelevant to the 
question whether the asset is property held by a taxpayer and 
is thus within federal tax laws general definition of capital 
asset 
because the capital stock held by arkansas best falls within 
the broad definition of the term capital asset in the tax code 
and is outside the classes of property excluded from capitalasset 
status the loss arising from the sale of the stock is a capital 
loss marshall said 
justice anthony m kennedy did not participate in the decision 
the case is arkansas best vs commissioner of internal revenue

script writers struck movie and television 
producers today and the union predicted viewers of talk shows game 
shows and daytime soaps would quickly notice a difference in 
programming 
hundreds of writers grabbed the writers guild strikes 
placards depicting a quill and lightning bolt as midmorning picket 
lines snaked in front of twentieth century fox studios 
the writers guild of america rejected a final offer presented 
sunday by the alliance of motion picture and television producers 
and called a walkout for 9000 of its 9600 members the 600 wga 
news writers are exempt from this action 
the strike began here and in new york city at 9 am pst today 
the contract expired at midnight feb 29 
marty waldman a wga spokesman in new york said there would be 
no picketing in the east today 
the longer the strike goes on the more reruns the public will 
see said brian walton wga west executive director and chief 
negotiator its a very tight ratings race and unfortunately for 
the networks it will impact them 
picket captain stanley ralph ross said selection of foxs west 
los angeles studio was fairly arbitrary adding its size and 
location had a lot to do with it 
we usually pick a major studio and theres parking around 
here ross said 
grandview usa writer ken hixon who marched with his 
2year old son sam said writers were much more unified for this 
strike than in their last walkout in 1985 
there was nearly a civil war last time between screen writers 
and television writers but this time theres real solidarity 
hixon said 
viewers will begin seeing the effects on those programs 
relying on scripts on a daily basis talk shows game shows and the 
soaps will see a difference right away said guild spokeswoman 
cheryl rhoden 
the strike slows down the production process and if prolonged 
it finally comes to a halt she said a threemonth strike 
delayed the fall television season three years ago 
walton said the network that would be hardest hit would be 
firstplace nbc whose the tonight show starring johnny carson 
saturday night live and late night with david letterman 
would be affected immediately 
edward adler president of wga east said nine soap operas on 
the east coast and five in california also would be affected 
immediately as would prime time miniseries television movies and 
features in development or in production 
but herb steinberg a spokesman for the alliance which 
represents 200 producers and studios said a strike was anticipated 
and scripts have been stockpiled 
shows like carsons show will go into reruns but we will 
continue business he said 
producers had sought to scale back residual payments for some 
onehour shows syndicated in the united states and said they 
couldnt pay writers more for reruns in foreign markets 
the median annual income for writers is 40000 a year but 
about half of the guilds members are unemployed at any given time 
said rhoden the writers sought the first change in 17 years in how 
they are compensated when programs are aired in foreign markets 
they now receive a single lump sum that varies depending on what is 
negotiated between the writer and producer 
the writers also demanded more artistic control on the final 
product 
we had all kinds of creative guarantees in there short of 
giving them total control steinberg said the director is the 
captain of that creative team we couldnt bargain away rights that 
belonged to other guilds and unions 
the producers had offered a 50 million package over a 
threeyear period including improvements in pension and health 
plans steinberg said 
in union ballots last week in los angeles and new york 96 
percent approved a walkout if no agreement was reached 
the last script writers strike was in 1985 and lasted two weeks 
since the wga won its first contract in 1947 script writers 
conducted strikes five times more than any other entertainment 
industry union 
separately the screen actors guild and american federation of 
television and radio artists bargained through the weekend with 
makers of tv and radio commercials over daily pay rates and rerun 
payments for 100000 actors 
members of those unions approved a strike by a 93 percent margin 
in recent votes said sag spokesman mark locher

the federal government and morton thiokol inc 
bought annuities for 7735000 to settle the claims by survivors 
of four of the astronauts who died aboard the space shuttle 
challenger according to documents released today 
morton thiokol the company that produced the faulty booster 
rocket blamed for the jan 28 1986 explosion paid 60 percent of 
the total cost of buying the annuities or 4641000 the justice 
department acknowledged the governments share 40 percent cost 
3094000 
the families will actually receive more than 77 million 
because the annuities pay out over a period of many years the 
total they will receive and the breakdown by family were not 
released 
the documents along with several justice department statements 
describing how the settlements were reached were released to 
settle a civil suit brought under the freedom of information act by 
the associated press and six other news organizations the 
government had originally kept all details of the settlements and 
how they were reached secret 
the settlements were reached by the government and the company 
with the immediate survivors of spacecraft commander dick scobee 
46 a retired air force officer employed by nasa mission 
specialist ellison s onizuka 39 an air force lieutenant colonel 
payload specialist gregory jarvis 41 an employee of hughes 
aircraft co and christa mcauliffe 37 a concord nh high 
school teacher 
scobee was survived by his wife june and two adult children 
onizuka by his wife lorna and two minor children jarvis by his 
wife marcia and mcauliffe by her husband steven and two minor 
children 
the government said in court documents filed during the suit 
that it began negotiations with these four and an informa 
representative on june 18 1986 the settlements were announced 
dec 29 1986 
the governments document make clear that the survivors of the 
four had no legal representation during the negotiations but 
received informal assistance from leo b lind jr the executor of 
mcauliffes estate and her husbands law partner 
lind said in an affidavit that the families never spoke directly 
to morton thiokol officials the families dealt only with justice 
department lawyers who negotiated with them on behalf of the 
contractor 
a presidential commission blamed the explosion on a plume of hot 
gas that leaked through a joint in a solidfuel booster rocket 
built by morton thiokol and ignited the main fuel tank the 
fireball consumed the challenger 73 seconds after launch from the 
kennedy space center in florida the astronauts are believed by the 
national aeronautics and space administration to have died before 
the debris hit the atlantic ocean 
survivors of two other challenger astronauts and jarvis father 
have reached settlements with morton thiokol to which the 
government did not contribute 
last month marvin resnik the divorced father of mission 
specialist judith a resnik 36 a civilian nasa employee settled 
with the company for an amount he said was commensurate with what 
some of the others got from 2 million to 35 million 
in january sarah resnik belfer divorced mother of the 
astronaut and bruce jarvis father of the hughes employee settled 
with the company the amounts were not disclosed 
last may the company settled a suit by cheryl mcnair wife of 
mission specialist ronald e mcnair 35 a civilian nasa employee 
who also left two infant children the amount was not disclosed 
jane smith wife of pilot michael j smith 40 a navy 
commander has a suit pending in federal court in florida against 
the company the government last month succeeded in having itself 
dismissed as a defendant in that suit on the basis of a supreme 
court decision that survivors of active duty military personnel may 
not sue the government for wrongful death 
a separate settlement agreement between the government and 
morton thiokol covered only the claims by the survivors of the four 
astronauts that agreement in no way abrogates any claim of any 
nature which the united states may have against mti for property 
damage associated with the challenger accident including but not 
limited to any claims for the loss of the orbiter itself the 
document said the replacement orbiter now under construction is 
expected to cost 3 billion 
nasa spokesman david garrett said today that negotiations are 
continuing between nasa and company lawyers on the type and amount 
of penalties that will be imposed on the utah rocketmakers 
contract with the government 
a nasa statement in february 1987 said that morton thiokol would 
forfeit 10 million in profit and would receive no profit from 409 
million worth of redesign work but garrett said that does not 
represent the end of the matter 
our lawyers are playing with it its in the hands of the 
general counsel he said

consumers have regained virtually all the 
confidence they lost as a result of the october stock market crash 
but there are indications employers could be cutting back their 
hiring plans according to two surveys released monday 
the conference board in issuing its monthly consumer confidence 
index said consumers have been heartened by continuing strength in 
the economy 
however the business research organization said consumers also 
may be feeling more optimistic because their paychecks are larger 
because of tax cuts that took effect jan 1 
the consumer confidence index was 1139 points in february up 
from januarys 1099 points and 1008 in november after the crash 
the index which uses a 1985 base of 100 stood at 1151 in 
october before the oct 19 stock collapse 
the conference boards help wanted index painted a somewhat less 
optimistic picture the index which reflects the amount of help 
wanted ads in 51 major newspapers across the nation declined to 
153 in january from 155 in december 
the index which uses a 1967 base of 100 reflects changes in 
demand for labor and general business conditions 
kenneth goldstein a conference board economist said the drop 
in the index signaled a slowdown in hiring plans by employers 
recent dips in want ad volume suggest that companies are 
taking a hard look at their expansion plans he said 
help wanted advertising volume fell in six of nine regions of 
the country new england the rockies pacific south atlantic 
middle atlantic and east south central ad volume increased in the 
west north central east north central and west south central areas

livestock and meat futures prices rose sharply monday as traders 
looked beyond the cash markets current problems and saw meat sales 
improving in the months ahead 
on other markets energy futures slid lower grains and soybeans 
were mostly higher precious metals retreated and stockindex 
futures advanced 
slack retail demand for meat during lent led to a slowdown in 
slaughters last week prompting fears of a growing supply of 
slaughterready cattle and hogs 
analysts said those fears along with the closing of at least 
one major beef packing plant were largely responsible for losses 
on livestock futures last week at the chicago mercantile exchange 
but indications of a cattle buildup did not surface monday 
leading many traders to rethink their positions and look ahead to a 
resurgence in demand after easter analysts said 
prices went down last week on ideas we were backing up cattle 
but we havent seen any proof of that yet said charlie 
richardson an analyst in denver for lindwaldock amp co 
in chicago philip stanley of thomsonmckinnon securities inc 
said traders had turned their attention to the future and away from 
the industrys current woes 
theyre thinking that retail demand will pick up packers will 
have to accumulate supplies and the cattle feeders will reap the 
profits by being able to sell cattle at higher prices stanley 
said 
richardson said some traders also bought livestock futures on 
ideas that prices for future delivery of cattle and hogs had fallen 
more sharply than conditions warranted 
and some were betting that a winter storm moving into the great 
plains would disrupt the movement of animals to market resulting 
in temporarily tight supplies and higher prices richardson said 
the bullish enthusiasm for cattle futures overflowed into the 
pork pits analysts said 
live cattle settled 87 cent to 138 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in april at 7155 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 80 cent to 110 cents higher with march at 8035 cents 
a pound hogs were 25 cent to 125 cents higher with april at 
4360 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 120 cents to 185 
cents higher with march at 5470 cents a pound 
energy futures prices retreated in moderate trading on the new 
york mercantile exchange following a slight advance in the previous 
session 
analysts attributed the decline to speculation that some member 
nations of the organization of petroleum exporting countries were 
selling oil at a discount 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents to 22 cents 
lower with april at 1537 a barrel heating oil was 13 cent to 
25 cent lower with april at 4341 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 34 cent to 57 cent lower with april at 4394 cents a 
gallon 
grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the chicago 
board of trade although soybean futures were mixed 
expectations of new export business supported the markets 
the agriculture department announced after the close that it had 
sold 16 million bushels of wheat friday in the last of last weeks 
three auctions for surplus governmentowned wheat 
the usda had targeted 10 million bushels for sale at that 
auction 
the agency also announced it would hold three auctions a week 
each with a 10millionbushel target through march 25 
wheat settled cent to 2 cents higher with march at 304 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents higher with march at 200 a 
bushel oats were cent to 4 cents higher with march at 190 a 
bushel soybeans were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with march 
at 613 a bushel 
gold and silver futures retreated slightly on the commodity 
exchange in new york 
but despite its weak tone the market appeared to have shaken 
off the recessionary expectactions that had weighed on prices in 
recent weeks said craig sloane an analyst in new york with smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
gold settled 10 cents to 30 cents lower with april at 43860 a 
troy ounce silver was 32 cents to 35 cents lower with march at 
6395 a troy ounce 
stockindex futures advanced on the chicago mercantile exchange

a federal judge said monday he will order a new 
election in the contested race for director of united auto workers 
unions eightstate southwest region ending part of a 21month 
legal battle 
its a victory for the people in region 5 whove had to 
operate without a legally elected director for 21 months said 
jerry tucker who lost by twotenths of a vote to incumbent region 
5 director kenneth worley in the august 1986 election 
judge richard suhrheinrich of the us district court for the 
eastern district of michigan heard arguments from attorneys for the 
us department of labor the uaw and tucker assistant director of 
region 5 who was fired after he announced plans to run against his 
boss in may 1986 
tucker is the leader of a dissident group within the uaw called 
the new directions movement which has called for less cooperation 
with companies that are forcing workers to compete with each other 
for jobs 
the labor department investigated the contest and called for new 
elections after it found some votes at the convention were cast by 
illegal delegates 
it also found that worley spent 13000 in union money on 
jackets bearing his name which were distributed at the uaw 
constitutional convention where the delegates voted and sent out 
campaign fliers typed with a uaw typewriter on uaw stationery in a 
uaw office 
labor department attorney janet graney who argued three 
lawsuits the department brought against the uaw concerning the 
election said such uses of union money and equipment for the 
campaign of an individual are illegal 
im going to order a new election there have been substantial 
uses of union facilities for worleys campaign suhrheinrich 
said adding that he would issue a formal order in two weeks 
the uaw declined comment until it receives the order the union 
has said it is willing only to run some of the delegate elections 
over 
in a new election 68 local unions in missouri kansas 
oklahoma arkansas texas louisiana colorado and new mexico will 
again choose 650 delegates who will vote for the director of region 
5 at a miniconvention 
the elections will not affect terms of local union officials 
suhrheinrich did not say how he would rule on one of the labor 
department suits which charges tucker was illegally fired or on a 
suit brought by tucker demanding reinstatement and payment of lost 
wages and benefits 
tuckers attorney joseph yablonski and the labor department 
argued that tucker was fired illegally because the uaw constitution 
allows international union staff members to run for union office 
they also argued that the rule used to fire tucker which 
requires staff members running for office to take a leave of 
absence 90 days before the election was never properly adopted by 
the unions leadership or by the rankandfile

sir nicholas goodison said monday he is resigning 
at the end of the year as chairman of the london stock exchange 
which he piloted through its big bang computer revolution in 
1986 and the market crash last october 
goodison 53 will take over the chairmanship of the trustee 
savings bank next jan 1 
i have served on the stock exchange council for the past 20 
years and been chairman for the past 12 i have been chairman 
during a period of great innovation and change and now feel that 
the structure for the future has been built goodison said in a 
statement 
an election among the stock exchanges members for a new 
chairman is likely in the fall 
goodison in his new post succeeds sir john read who will be 70 
on march 29 and due for retirement this year from leadership of the 
trustee savings bank which is a financial services group as well 
as a bank with 19 million investors 
goodison has been chairman of stockbrokers quilter goodison co 
ltd since 1975 
he said the stock crash of last october and november had nothing 
to do with his move and that the oldstyle exchange could not have 
absorbed the wave of selling 
when he became chairman goodison was confronted with the then 
labor governments decision to reconstruct the stock exchange by 
separating marketmakers and brokers into different partnerships 
eleven years later came the big bang on oct 27 1986 ending 
fixed commissions and the distinction between brokers who were 
agents in the buying and selling of shares and stockjobbers who 
actively traded in shares at prices they quoted to brokers

employment levels raising doubts about forecasts of an economic 
slowdown later this year 
david hale economist for kemper financial services in chicago 
said the report prompted some investment firms to raise their 
economic growth forecasts faster growth is generally viewed 
negatively in the bond market because credit demands increase when 
the economy expands pushing interest rates up 
sung won sohn chief economist for norwest corp in minneapolis 
said the bond market was also hurt by a new decline in the dollar 
and a slight rise in the commodity research bureau index mainly 
due to higher meat prices 
a falling dollar reduces the yields available to foreign 
investors on dollardenominated investments it also raises 
pressure on domestic producers to keep prices low to compete with 
foreign products

the treasury department sold 64 billion in threemonth bills 
at an average discount rate of 574 percent up from 562 percent

percent on jan 25 the rates for sixmonth bills were the highest 
since feb 16 when they averaged 603 percent 
in a separate report the federal reserve said the average yield 
for oneyear treasury bills the most popular index for making 
changes in adjustable rate mortgages held steady at 663 percent 
last week the same as the rate for the previous week

american standard inc said monday its board of 
directors would consider the latest hostile buyout offer from black 
amp decker corp and indicated it might sweeten its own alternative

late january last friday sweetened its outstanding tender offer to 
73 a share from 68 for american standards 31 million common

portion was 59 a share 
american standard rose 75 cents to 7325 a share monday on the 
new york stock exchange black amp decker dipped 37 cents to 18 a 
share a decline stemming partly from an adjustment for a dividend 
payment 
william b boyd american standards chairman and chief 
executive said the companys recapitalization plan already was 
financially superior to black amp deckers sweetened tender offer and 
advised shareholders not to tender their stock 
in the meantime stockholders should be aware that if black amp 
decker increases its offer beyond the values we can achieve for our 
stockholders in a recapitalization we would vigorously pursue 
other alternatives in order to enhance stockholder value boyd 
stated 
he also said american standard was working on ways to further 
improve its recapitalization plan but did not elaborate 
black amp decker a towson mdbased maker of tools and

members of their management for about 100 million posting a 
pretax profit of 16 million 
in late 1986 lorimar had agreed to buy seven bigcity storer 
and wometco television stations from kohlberg kravis amp roberts for 
185 billion the move would have given lorimar 12 stations around 
the us and in puerto rico

of the market for television stations and the company has sold 
some of the stations it already owned and is seeking buyers for the

the teamsters union asked northwest airlines on 
monday to submit issues separating the company and its 6500 flight 
attendants to binding arbitration 
northwest airlines said it would not agree to arbitration but 
was willing to resume talks 
william genoese director of the teamsters airline division 
said flight attendants were prepared to strike if the airline did 
not agree to arbitration in 72 hours 
gov james blanchards administration backed the arbitration 
request said state labor director betty howe who joined genoese 
in a news conference at a teamsters office in detroit 
the flight attendants more than 2000 of them based in detroit 
have worked since a feb 26 strike deadline but no talks have been 
held for the past week 
genoese cited economic and safety concerns as reasons for 
holding off on a strike this long 
he referred to a federal aviation administration report friday 
on safety concerns at northwest airlines and said a strike would 
mean operating with less experienced replacement flight attendants 
this would threaten both the comfort and safety of northwest 
passengers he said 
issues dividing the two sides include a twotier wage system 
under which attendants hired after may 1984 must work five years to 
earn the same as those hired earlier the airline proposes to 
extend the time to nine years 
howe without commenting on the merits of either side said 
the blanchard administration is concerned about the detroitbased 
flight attendants jobs and the potential economic impact of a 
strike 
northwest airlines accounts for about half the air traffic in 
and out of detroit metropolitan airport the largest of its three 
hubs the airline operates about 248 flights a day at metro about 
227 at minneapolis where it is headquartered and 201 at its 
memphis tenn hub

the federal government and rocket maker morton 
thiokol inc paid 7735000 in cash and annuities and divided the 
cost 4060 to settle all claims by the families of four of the 
astronauts who died in the challenger explosion 
documents released monday showed that morton thiokol which 
produced the faulty booster rocket blamed for the jan 28 1986 
explosion paid 4641000 the governments share of the 
settlements was 3094000 
a lawyer who represented other family members called the 
settlements woefully inadequate 
the surviving four spouses and six children actually will 
receive more than 77 million this is because each was given an 
annuity which pays benefits larger than its cost but over a period 
of many years 
the total dollar amount the families will receive over time and 
the breakdown by family were not released 
with the release of the documents the justice department 
settled a civil suit brought under the freedom of information act 
by the associated press and six other news organizations the 
government originally had kept details of the settlements and 
negotiations secret saying it needed to keep its internal 
deliberations confidential and that the company and families 
demanded secrecy 
the documents with some deletions to preserve family privacy 
included the final settlement agreements with the families and the 
company some correspondence between the government and the 
company and several justice department statements concerning the 
negotiations 
the settlements were reached dec 29 1986 with the immediate 
survivors of spacecraft commander dick scobee 46 a retired air 
force officer employed by the national aeronautics and space 
administration mission specialist ellison s onizuka 39 an air 
force lieutenant colonel payload specialist gregory jarvis 41 an 
employee of hughes aircraft co and christa mcauliffe 37 a 
concord nh public high school teacher 
scobee is survived by his wife june and two adult children 
onizuka left his wife lorna and two minor children jarvis left 
his wife marcia and mcauliffe left her husband steven and two 
minor children 
among the disclosures 
the four families had no lawyers during the negotiations they 
relied instead on informal advice from leo b lind jr the law 
partner of mcauliffes husband and executor of her estate 
the justice department did all the negotiating for morton 
thiokol as well as the government lind said in an affidavit that 
the families never spoke to company officials 
the rocket maker and its insurers twice tried to have the 
settlements cover any property damage morton thiokol might have 
caused such as destruction of the orbiter and payload the 
government refused and those claims are still in negotiation 
although the justice department claims it cannot legally be 
sued by the families of military or federal civilian employees who 
die on duty it contributed 40 percent to each of the settlements 
only the jarvis and mcauliffe relatives had a right to sue the 
government all the astronaut families could sue the company 
even morton thiokols attorneys said the government was being 
unfair to the divorced parents of mission specialist judith a 
resnik 36 a civilian nasa employee my negotiations on behalf 
of morton thiokol have been constrained by the governments refusal 
to participate to any degree at all in a settlement the company 
considered acceptable company attorney john w adler wrote justice 
last july 
michael d oldak resniks exhusband represented her father 
marvin and last month reached a settlement with the company to 
which the government did not contribute 
asked about the document release oldak said monday it 
confirmed our suspicion that the government had made a contribution 
to people in judys situation that is government employees and 
that we were being treated unfairly 
marvin resnik said that settlement was commensurate with what 
some of the others got from 2 million to 35 million 
in january resniks mother sarah resnik belfer and jarvis 
father bruce settled with morton thiokol but the government did 
not contribute 
last may the company settled a suit by cheryl mcnair wife of 
mission specialist ronald e mcnair 35 a civilian nasa employee 
who also left two infant children 
ronald krist the houston lawyer who represented bruce jarvis 
sarah belfer and the mcnairs said he would not have allowed his 
clients to accept such a woefully inadequate settlement as the 
four did 
they would have netted more money if they had been adequately 
represented krist said even taking attorneys fees into account 
betty grissom whose husband gus was killed in the apollo one 
fire on the launch pad in 1967 said she was treated unjustly when 
it came to settlement of her claim against north american rockwell 
it kind of hurts it hurts when i think that theyre getting 
that much money she said she and her two children received 
350000 
jane smith wife of pilot michael j smith 40 a navy 
commander has a suit pending in federal court against the company 
the government last month was dismissed as a defendant because 
military personnel may not sue the government for wrongful death 
a presidential commission said the explosion occurred when hot 
gas leaked through a joint in a booster rocket built by thiokol and 
ignited the main fuel tank 
a separate agreement between the government and morton thiokol 
asserted that disposal of the four claims in no way abrogates any 
claim of any nature which the united states may have against mti 
for property damage associated with the challenger accident 
including but not limited to any claims for the loss of the orbiter 
itself the document said the replacement orbiter now under 
construction is expected to cost 3 billion 
nasa spokesman david garrett said monday that negotiations are 
continuing between nasa and thiokol lawyers on the type and amount 
of penalties that will be imposed on the utah rocketmakers 
contract with the government 
a nasa statement in february 1987 said thiokol would forfeit 10 
million in profit and receive no profit from 409 million worth of 
redesign work but garrett said that does not end the matter

a tentative settlement reached early monday 
between the united auto workers union and chrysler corp derailing 
the threat of a strike at a key sterling heights stamping plant 
obviously the company is hopeful that the workers will ratify 
the agreement and that the threat of a strike will disappear 
chrysler spokesman lloyd northard said 
sterling heights makes metal hoods and trunk lids for all 
domestically made chrysler cars and most trucks and makes fuel 
tanks for all chrysler cars except one 
a strike there would soon have hurt all chrysler production and 
additional strikes at a few other key plants could have crippled 
chrysler within days 
uaw vice president marc stepp had joined negotiations between 
chrysler and uaw local 1264 on friday a day after chrysler 
announced it would not sell its acustar inc parts subsidiary 
the union would have been the first to receive stepps 
permission to strike over local issues such as healthandsafety 
grievances and violation of work rules 
stepp had promised to give immediate strike authorization to all 
locals with legitimate grievances but after chrysler decided to 
keep its 28000worker acustar subsidiary he began moving to 
resolve local disputes 
stepp and other negotiators bargained through the weekend and 
reached a tentative settlement on local 1264s grievances at 5 am 
monday the union said stepp was unavailable for comment monday 
the union said it was withholding details of the agreement until 
march 11 when the locals 3600 active and 500 laidoff members 
will vote on the settlement 
we saved a lot of jobs and got additional jobs said fred 
obrien local 1264 recording secretary and a member of the locals 
bargaining committee 
obrien said chrysler agreed to add workers to clean up oil that 
leaks from the plants massive presses onto the shop floor and to 
clean and repair the machines as a matter of routine 
workers had complained that because the presses are run around 
the clock they dont receive adequate maintenance particularly 
cleaning and the machines and the floors around them are covered 
with oil and dirt 
local 1264 had accumulated nearly 140 unresolved grievances 
since last year other locals had been gathering grievances so they 
could be ready to strike if chrysler had decided to sell acustar

homestake mining co rejected as inadequate 
an unsolicited 188 billion buyout offer from the partnership led 
by t boone pickens on monday and said it wished to remain 
independent 
the board of directors of homestake the nations biggest gold 
producer unanimously rejected the 20 a share buyout offer made 
last month by pickens mesa limited partnership 
homestake stock closed at 1712 a share monday on the new york 
stock exchange unchanged from fridays close 
pickens had labeled the buyout offer a friendly bid and proposed 
a negotiated transaction with homestakes managers 
but homestakes board concluded the offer was inadequate and not 
in the best interests of the stockholders said company officials 
in light of our business prospects we are better off served 
as an independent company said stephanie kushner homestakes 
manager of financial services we are trying to focus on the 
financial future of the company 
were really in a strong position right now with significant 
cash assets and a very strong balance sheet and our management is 
in a better position to put that money to work for the company 
kushner stated 
homestake one of the largest gold producers in the western 
world outside of south africa owns the homestake gold mine in 
south dakota and the mclaughlin mine in northern california the 
company also has a onequarter interest in the round mountain mine 
in nevada 
in addition homestake owns a 425 percent interest in the doe 
run co the largest us producer of lead products and a 48 
percent interest in two mines in western australia 
kushner noted pickens had not made a tender offer to homestake 
shareholders and she was unsure whether he would now pursue a 
hostile takeover in light of the boards rejection 
the offer was pickens second move on a goldmining company in 
six months his 2 billion takeover attempt for new yorkbased 
newmont mining corp was blocked when newmonts biggest 
shareholder consolidated gold fields plc acquired a controlling 
stake in the company to help thwart the hostile bid

striking scriptwriters warned that their 
walkout would send tv soap operas talk shows and variety programs 
into reruns but producers said monday they have stockpiled enough 
scripts to ride out a long strike 
movie and television scriptwriters left their typewriters and 
joined nearly 2000 colleagues on a picket line at 20th century fox 
studios in a contract dispute over the issues of residuals and 
creative control 
carrying placards reading the writers guild strikes pickets 
fiveabreast snaked in front of the fox studios in west los angeles 
hollywood has treated writers like beanfield workers for 
years said screenwriter and science fiction author harlan 
ellison it begins with the dream without the dream on paper 
there is nothing 
the writers guild of america rejected sundays final offer by 
the alliance of motion picture and television producers and a 
strike was ordered for 9000 of its 9600 members six hundred news 
writers were exempt 
we feel all the issues were dealt with fairly they went on 
strike on issues we felt were resolved alliance spokesman herb 
steinberg said adding producers were ready to write a check for 
550 million for a new threeyear contract the alliance 
represents about 200 producers and studios 
the federal mediation and conciliation service scheduled a 
meeting for both sides tuesday 
issues include demands by writers for a higher percentage of 
foreign market distribution residuals and an offer by producers to 
scale back syndication residuals for onehour television shows 
producers claim new shows made for independent stations have 
dried up the rerun syndication market their offer includes an 
increase to 150 percent of current residual agreements if the show 
does well in syndication 
writers claim the offer is not equitable with a similar deal 
given the directors guild last summer 
actress patty duke president of the screen actors guild also 
showed up on the picket line to show solidarity with the writers 
but the actors contract prohibits secondary walkouts 
the union said talk shows game shows and soap operas would 
quickly reflect the strikes impact but producers said scripts had 
been stockpiled and that many primetime shows had completed 
shooting for the season 
viewers will begin seeing the effects on those programs 
relying on scripts on a daily basis talk shows game shows and the 
soaps will see a difference right away guild spokeswoman cheryl 
rhoden said 
a threemonth strike delayed the fall television season in 1981 
its business as usual were prepared cbs spokeswoman 
janet storm said the network produces the soaps guiding light 
as the world turns the bold and the beautiful and the 
young and the restless 
nbc spokesman dom giofre said the networks another world 
days of our lives and santa barbara wouldnt be affected 
soon because there were scripts already written for another month 
the strike wont immediately effect nbcs late night with 
david letterman and saturday night live which were already 
on scheduled breaks the tonight show with johnny carson 
featured guest host jay leno on monday as scheduled but the 
comedian used material prepared before the strike giofre said 
on daily production shows such as soap operas writers normally 
turn out scripts near shooting schedule deadlines shows like 
late night with david letterman are known for adlib lines but 
much of the monologue and skits are created by a writing staff 
since much of the material is topical it often is written within 
minutes of showtime 
picket captain stanley ralph ross said selection of fox was 
fairly arbitrary adding its size and location had a lot to do 
with it we usually pick a major studio and theres parking 
around here 
the guilds contract expired at midnight feb 29 
producers had sought to scale back residual payments for some 
onehour shows syndicated in the united states and said they 
couldnt pay writers more for reruns in foreign markets 
steinberg claimed foreign residual payments have increased 846 
percent since 1972 which was the last time writers negotiated that 
issue writers receive a single lump sum that varies depending on 
what is negotiated between the writer and producer 
when the business is good they are going to share it 
steinberg said but while were making money in foreign were 
still losing money in domestic and that foreign distribution money 
has to cover those losses 
the median annual income for writers is 40000 a year but 
about half of the wgas members are unemployed at any given time 
ms rhoden said
