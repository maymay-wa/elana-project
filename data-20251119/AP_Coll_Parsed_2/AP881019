the house voted wednesday to bar authorities 
in new york and new jersey from disposing sewage sludge in the 
atlantic ocean after 1991 
the measure passed by a voice vote would impose stiff fines 
for any dumping after dec 31 1991 the fines are aimed at making 
the dumping prohibitively expensive and the penalty fees would be 
used to pay for alternatives 
sen bill bradley dnj said the bill was a major 
breakthrough in reclaiming our oceans and shores this legislation 
gives local sewage authorities the clear message that they must 
find alternatives to ocean dumping not sometime in the distant 
future but right now 
president reagan is expected to sign the bill which is a 
compromise between differing sludgedumping bills passed by the 
senate in august and the house earlier this month 
nine agencies in new york and new jersey dump about 8 million 
tons of sludge a year at a site about 106 miles east of new jersey 
another site 12 miles offshore was closed in 1987 
the new bill would set a fee of 100 per ton of sludge dumped 
beginning jan 1 and the dumpers would be expected to negotiate 
with federal authorities toward a timetable to end their dumping 
those that cannot work out a deal would see their fees rise to 
200 a ton by the end of 1991 
starting in 1992 penalties starting at 600 per ton would be 
added to the fees the penalties would rise by 11 percent a year 
for continuing violators and eventually would total tens of 
millions of dollars 
in 1978 congress set a 1981 deadline to stop ocean sludge 
dumping but new york sued and got the ban suspended saying the 
deadline would be impossible to meet however a bipartisan 
coalition of east coast lawmakers worked in favor of a ban

with less than three weeks left michael 
dukakis seems to be still searching for something that has escaped 
him all fall a compelling reason for voters to toss out the 
republicans and turn to him 
dukakis has jumped from theme to theme in his search for an 
economic message that resonates with the american voters swiss 
cheese economy bring prosperity home middleclass 
squeeze and making america no 1 have all had their moments 
as staples in his speeches 
each has been an attempt to capsulize what he is offering the 
american voters and to give voters a reason to turn to the 
candidate who represents change 
the democratic presidential nominees campaign has been 
frustrated so far however in seeing his messages fail to register 
as republican george bush succeeded in painting him as a 
traditional northern liberal 
dukakis has settled for now on an appeal to economic 
nationalism borrowing rhetoric from former democratic rival 
richard gephardt in hitting the republicans on the trade deficit 
it is an appeal some democrats have long advised dukakis to make 
but one they say he has seemed reluctant to take on after 
shunning protectionism in the primaries against gephardt 
dukakis aides say their plan all along was to make their case on 
economic issues depicting bush as the candidate of the wealthy and 
privileged but there is an urgency almost desperation now as 
polls show dukakis slipping farther behind after their final 
debate and the clock running out 
he has to give people a reason to vote for him in the final 
three weeks said dukakis adviser francis obrien thats the 
next step 
dukakis inability to make a forceful case is bound up in the 
problems of running as the candidate of change at a time of 
relative peace and prosperity 
as bush has succeeded in running as the heir to president 
reagan dukakis has been pointing to economic unease about the 
future based on mounting deficits and the trade imbalance but as 
in 1984 voters havent seemed to share the concern and bush has 
portrayed dukakis as representing threatening and uncertain change 
hes had difficulty there and you have to have some sympathy 
for him said larry sabato university of virginia political 
scientist 
its a time of peace and prosperity for all practical 
purposes and you have a natural heir apparent to the 
administration thats produced peace and prosperity that is a 
tough combination to beat 
worse from dukakis point of view the election is coming at a 
time when the unemployment rate is at a low and public approval of 
reagans performance is at a high point 
hes made the case that he offers some interesting new 
politics but i dont think hes given people a strong case to vote 
for him as the candidate of change said william schneider 
analyst at the conservative american enterprise institute 
dukakis has also been frustrated in seeing the debate turn on 
issues raised forcefully by bush and by bushs powerful television 
advertisements they include accusations that dukakis is soft on 
crime weak on defense and in the south and west that he would 
advocate gun control 
dukakis has been getting plenty of advice as democrats see their 
best shot at retaking the white house slipping away 
he needs to tell people this has been a terrible campaign 
that there are issues where they have fundamental differences that 
havent been addressed said seattle mayor charles royer a 
supporter who believes dukakis will carry washington state he 
needs to be telling people what he will do and what hes about as 
he did at the democratic national convention 
dukakis has been urged by some to buy a block of network 
television time 30 minutes or so and hope a dramatic speech on 
the economy could turn things around 
but he also has been assailed within his own party for failing 
to assert himself more forcefully 
hes got to show some passion commitment leadership said 
rep bill alexander dark he may have made an aplus in 
political science but so far he hasnt passed politics

romanias industrialization the absence 
of environmental protection measures and official carelessless 
spell ecological disaster for that communist nation and its 23 
million citizens an underground study says 
a copy of the 22page handwritten report was received this 
week by the associated press the study was signed by 13 members of 
the littleknown romanian democratic action a small underground 
opposition group reportedly established in 1985 
western analysts said the survey written this year was the 
first concrete attempt to define a platform for a possible 
ecological opposition in romania 
although its authors had no access to official statistics the 
study contains many facts and details in contrast to scant and 
sporadic information in the staterun media which usually avoid 
discussing ecological failures 
it said romanias economic crisis threatens to become an 
ecological catastrophe with the bucharest authorities pursuing 
a primitive concept of intensive and pitiless exploitation of the 
soil and nature 
the survey denounced the regime of president nicolae ceausescu 
for allegedly ignoring the general deterioration of the environment 
it reported heavy pollution in the metallurgical centers of 
galati in eastern romania hunedoara in the west and tirgoviste in 
the south 
the effort to write off at any cost romanias foreign debt 
now estimated at about 4 billion has led to the aging of 
industrial installations said the study 
thats why the industrial complexes left at the level of the 
1970s are big energy spenders and polluters 
a huge redcolored cloud hangs day and night over 
tirgoviste it went on noting that an attempt to provide a 
filtering system for the local alloyedsteel combine was a total 
failure 
similarly the chemical industry poses a particularly high 
risk for the environment it said 
six major accidents took place at a pharmaceutical plant in 
bucharest in the past 10 years followed by considerable leaks of 
unidentified toxic gases which alarmed residents living in the 
area said the report 
nobody said anything and no measures of any kind were taken 
the report said 
a dense chlorine gas that repeatedly escaped in recent years 
from a chemical complex in giurgiu in southern romania drifted over 
the northern bulgarian city of ruse causing a rift between the two 
soviet bloc allies 
the bulgarian bta news agency said in february that the sharp 
smell of chlorine made breathing difficult forcing people to clamp 
handkerchiefs over their mouths and race for shelter 
in an attempt to stop what bulgarian media called an 
ecological disaster in ruse the two countries last fall set up a 
joint commissiom to take measures toward ending the chlorine 
pollution in the border area 
it was not known if the problem still exists in the area 
the report said weapons factories at mirsa and zarnesti in 
central transylvania pose a constant danger for the local 
population following catastrophic explosions in 1980 1983 and 
1984 
the study appeared to confirm unofficial accounts of the 
accidents which purportedly led to the death of hundreds of people 
and triggered enormous leaks of chlorine and a mixture of 
chemical solvents 
it said the ecological balance is being destroyed in the 
vicinity of romanias paper factories for apparent lack of filters 
and other preventive installations damaging the health of nearby 
residents 
according to the survey romanias coalfired power plants 
using lowgrade coal spew hundreds of thousands of tons of 
toxic gases and residues into the atmosphere 
abuse of chemical fertilizers and insecticides in romanias 
stateowned agriculture reportedly led to advanced land 
deterioration and erosion in some areas 
even ceausescu publicly complained in february about overuse 
of herbicides and of various chemical products to combat various 
diseases in agriculture following official reports about 
livestock deaths resulting from contaminated fodder 
western observers and romanian sources said it was the first 
time ceausescu warned of the dangers of chemicalized 
agriculture a longstanding practice of communist planners to 
increase crop yields 
the report said water pollution was also a serious problem and 
many rivers have been turned into virtual sewers 
drinking water is already reported rationed in many towns to 
compensate for lack of adequate filters large amounts of 
chlorine above admissible doses are being used it said 
improvised dumping sites are being tolerated toxic substances 
are thrown directly into rivers and car batteries lubricants and 
expired drugs are being indiscriminately dumped the report said

many american farmers have endured tough times 
during the reagan era capped by a withering drought that played 
havoc with crops in this election year 
but that same drought has driven up prices and mopped up 
surpluses and that could strengthen republican george bushs 
appeal for farm votes that many politicians thought once were 
locked up for michael dukakis and the democrats 
in agriculture bush sees a rural america on the mend and headed 
for greater prosperity built around a freemarket philosophy 
dukakis sees a rural economy still seriously ailing and in need 
of government help to support the family farmer and guarantee 
reasonable prices for crops 
the difference between the two is bush is happy we think 
theres a crisis still out there said ted mondale the dukakis 
midwest political director 
sen thad cochran rmiss a bush agricultural adviser called 
the dukakis program a big mystery that is causing anxiety in farm 
country 
they seem to be in favor of massive cutbacks in production 
cochran charged 
the democratic nominee has not endorsed the stringent production 
controls that two farm state democrats sen tom harkin of iowa and 
rep richard gephardt of missouri have sought their bill died in 
the 100th congress 
mondale said dukakis supports the concept but not the 
particulars of the harkingephardt legislation 
dukakis in his position paper on agriculture said us farm 
policy must include a combination of supply management and 
reasonable price supports in a way that makes it possible for 
family farmers to earn a decent living from the land 
while bush often refers derisively to dukakis supply 
management ideas the 1985 farm bill that bush lavishly praises 
also gave the government supply management powers and mondale said 
the reagan administrations price supports and setasides were all 
supply management tools 
bush has said the bipartisan 1985 farm bill is just beginning to 
pay off for farmers it has led to lower commodity prices which 
coupled with the drop in the dollars value helped boost farm 
exports 18 percent last year he says and he boasts that net cash 
farm income last year was a record 57 billion 
rural america has been strongly tested in recent years 
however i believe we have seen the bottom and are headed back 
up says bush 
the vice president says he would press ahead with efforts to 
phase out over a reasonable period those subsidies that distort 
agricultural trade if and only if other countries do the same 
but he promises to preserve a true safety net to ensure the 
viability of the family farm and rural america 
dukakis says farmers and ranchers are being squeezed at both 
ends facing lower commodity prices and a shrinking share of each 
food dollar down from 32 percent in 1976 to 25 percent now 
still lower prices are not the answer the democrat argues 
our present policy seems to be guided by a desire to drive 
commodity prices lower and lower in the hope of some future 
recovery of lost markets 
dukakis promises to target farm program benefits to family 
farmers who need them most 
dukakis hopes to narrow the federal deficit by reducing farm 
subsidies in his last debate with bush the massachusetts governor 
said he was sure a dukakis administration could give our farm 
families a decent income without spending 20to25 billion a year 
in farm subsidies 
farm subsidies shot up from 5 billion in 1980 under the carter 
administration to 25 billion in 1986 under reagan this year the 
administration and congress came up with nearly 4 billion in 
emergency drought aid 
but the droughtfed higher crop prices also reduce the need for 
government price supports 
mondale son of the former vice president said ruefully that 
bush was claiming credit for higher prices and exports that really 
belongs to the weather and the democrats farm state 
legislators most of them democrats had to shove the export 
enhancement program down the reagan administrations throat he 
said 
bush constantly reminds rural audiences of the carter 
administrations 1979 grain embargo against the soviet union and 
implies that dukakis is liable to try another bush promises he 
wont use farmers and ranchers and their families as foreign 
policy pawns 
but dukakis says in no instance would i impose an embargo 
dukakis says the productivity of us farmers should be viewed 
as a blessing not a curse surplus farm commodities should be 
better used to feed hungry people both at home and aborad he 
favors barter with countries that want our farm goods but dont 
have the needed currency 
bush has promised to devote an economic summit meeting with the 
major us allies to the subject of agriculture 
both candidates support wider use of ethanol the alternative 
fuel made from gasoline and alcohol 
dukakis has also promised help for ailing rural hospitals and 
other steps to revitalize rural communities 
bush suggests rural enterprise zones to help distressed 
communities 
whether rural america perceives its own glass as halffull or 
halfempty may decide which candidate wins the farm state vote 
theres a lot of optimism in agriculture today compared with 
several years ago when huge surpluses were hanging over the 
market said cochran with inflation under control and interest 
rates at least stable farmers are feeling they may be able to 
work their way clear of some indebtedness 
mondale said the key to this election is whether we can get 
mike dukakis ag program out so that people on main street 
understand it and see that its a reasonable one

michael dukakis is adding bodies to his field 
operations in target states and tougher rhetoric to his speeches 
and television ads in hopes of overtaking republican george bush in 
the three weeks before voters choose the next president 
dukakis aides said tuesday that dozens of workers at the 
democratic campaigns boston headquarters are being assigned to 
states for the final push joining them will be more than 1300 
volunteers recruited in washington 
the new infusion of personnel comes at a time when dukakis is 
adding fresh attacks on bush to his speeches 
george bush cares about the people on easy street dukakis 
said tuesday in michigan i care about the people on main street 
hes on their side im on your side 
that rhetoric fits with dukakis attempt to portray bush as a 
candidate of the rich a theme the democratic nominee supports with 
a scornful reference to george bushs one new idea a tax 
break for the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers 
dukakis also has decided to attack bush over the airwaves with a 
new ad set to begin airing tonight that shows the vice president 
meeting with suspected drug trafficker manuel antonio noriega the 
ad scoffs both at bushs job as the reagan administrations leader 
in the drug war and his proposal to give dan quayle that job in a 
bush administration 
with polls giving bush a doubledigit lead senior dukakis aides 
met with headquarters staffers tuesday to reassure them victory was 
within reach and to discuss transfers 
at that meeting senior dukakis aides said the campaign will 
focus on about 25 states in which dukakis either is leading or 
remains competitive according to a source who attended the session 
jack corrigan dirctor of operations for dukakis said in a 
telephone interview that about 60 percent of the boston staffers 
and volunteers would be reassigned to the field he could not 
provide a specific number 
also shifted into a new role was marcia hale who was helping 
prepare for a transition to a dukakis presidency until being tapped 
to help direct from boston political activities in southern 
states in which dukakis is competitive principally georgia and 
louisiana 
wendy sherman who runs the campaigns washington office said 
she has recruited more than 1300 volunteers to assist the field 
effort in target states on projects ranging from precinct politics 
to helping with phone banks and distributing campaign literature 
many of them are congressional aides with prior election 
experience she said 
dukakis closing strategy also calls on the candidate to make 
the most of opportunities to appear on television news programs 
also being considered according to sources is the purchase of 
network television time for a direct dukakis appeal to voters 
while that plan is reviewed the campaign is adding to its 
repertoire of paid tv ads 
after nearly a week of airing two positive ads featuring a 
conversational dukakis the democratic campaign is launching a 
direct assault on bush and running mate quayle 
the new ad blasts both bushs role in the reagan 
administrations antidrug effort and the vice presidents promise 
to put dan quayle in charge of that effort if elected 
cocaine traffic up 300 percent the narrator says while a 
photo of cocaine bundles flashes on tv screens 
panamanian drug lord noriega kept on the payroll the ad 
continues as the bushnoriega photo appears thats the bush 
record on fighting drugs 
the ad then features a clip of quayle saying im gonna be 
coordinating the drug effort 
it ends with the narration if george bush couldnt handle the 
job how do you think dan quayle is going to do 
additional network ads challenging bushs record also are 
planned as is a flurry of commercials tailored for specific target 
states including ohio california and texas according to dukakis 
aides

rep pat swindall is portraying himself as a 
modern day david facing a government goliath as he prepares for 
trial next monday in atlanta on a 10count federal indictment 
charging him with lying to a grand jury investigating money 
laundering 
it is a very simple case swindall said in an interview 
tuesday it is called trial by ambush theyve had one year to 
prepare their case im going to go in and face the entire 
resources of the irs the fbi and the justice department 
swindall a secondterm republican who is facing a tough 
reelection fight in his suburban atlanta district nov 8 was 
indicted monday on charges of lying to a federal grand jury the 
grand jury was hearing evidence gathered during a nationwide money 
laundering sting operation by the internal revenue service 
he sought and was granted an expedited trial in hopes of 
clearing his name before the election he said that move forced him 
to act as his own attorney since no lawyer would be able to 
prepare for the trial in just one week 
swindall said he has not tried a criminal case in seven years 
and has tried only four criminal cases in his entire legal career 
in all four cases he said he was assisted by another lawyer 
swindall said he intends to call us attorney robert l barr 
jr as a witness to explain why he waited until less than a month 
before the election to seek an indictment based on grand jury 
testimony given eight months earlier 
while refusing to speculate on the republican prosecutors 
motives swindall said his electioneve indictment indicates that 
the government either has a very weak case or its a very 
political case 
i dont think i would have ever even been scrutinized but for 
who i am he said if i were john q citizen i would not have 
ever had to testify before the grand jury i could have told the 
government to take their grand jury and stick it in their ear 
the perjury charges against swindall stem from his grand jury 
testimony about discussions he had last year with atlanta 
businessman charles lechasney and michael mullaney an undercover 
irs agent posing as a money broker about an 850000 home mortgage 
loan he was seeking 
swindall accepted a 150000 check from lechasney at one point 
during the negotiations but returned it uncashed three days later 
when lechasney was indicted in january swindall said he contacted 
the us attorneys office in atlanta to tell them he had had 
dealings with lechasney 
the indictment accuses swindall of lying when he told the grand 
jury he did not report the loan negotiations to authorities because 
i never satisfied myself of anything with respect to 
criminality 
he also is accused of lying when he denied there had been 
discussions about trying to conceal the trail of the money and when 
he denied that mullaney specifically informed him that source of 
the loan could be illegal drug money 
the charges carry a possible punishment of up to 50 years 
imprisonment 
when he returned to washington on tuesday following his 
indictment monday swindall received a letter from president reagan 
congratulating him on his 38th birthday 
may your special day be filled with joy and may the year to 
come bring you every happiness reagan wrote

voters must provide the passion to elect 
michael dukakis while the democratic presidential nominee should 
devote his attention to the issues says former candidate jesse 
jackson 
the issue is not dukakis passion its bushs lack of 
compassion jackson told a rally tuesday at tulane university 
when dukakis talks about housing energy jobs day care and the 
rights of women hes going in the right direction we the 
people provide the passion let him provide the priorities 
the former contender for the democratic nomination has come 
under attack recently for his less than passionate support for his 
partys ticket jackson in a telephone interview earlier in the 
day said that its absolutely false to say his support has been 
less than strong 
no democrat since atlanta has traveled more miles spoken to 
more people and registered more democrats for the ticket than i 
have the democratic runnerup said from his chicago home 
during the tulane rally one of two new orleans campus rallies 
added to jacksons schedule tuesday night he listed an itinerary 
of 18 appearances in 16 cities around the country 
a week ago my schedule was typical but expresses my own 
commitment and determination said jackson i challenge you to 
work too 
mark goodin a bush spokesman in washington said jackson has 
done a tremendous disappearing act 
i think thats probably by design of dukakis strategists 
goodin said if youre a liberal trying to run as a moderate 
jesse jackson who doesnt hide his liberalism is not a plus for 
you 
in his speech jackson hit hard at republican nominee george 
bushs stands on social issues and at his attacks on dukakis as a 
liberal and member of the american civil liberties union 
why assume that those who want to change things are somehow 
subversive jackson asked the crowd of 1900 students at a 
getoutthevote rally in the tulane auditorium 
jacksons wholehearted support for the dukakisbentsen ticket is 
considered essential in a handful of states where he won primaries 
especially those with heavy concentrations of blacks those include 
georgia and louisiana where the democrats are still competitive 
jackson in the earlier interview said he was urging everyone 
to do their part rather than judging anyone 
we have 26 democratic governors 53 senators 270 house 
members and the majority of urban democratic mayors he said 
slightly misstating the numbers if each of those leaders with 
portfolio will pull their weight if they will cast their net 
with this ticket well have enough votes to win 
he did single out the democratic leadership council which was 
formed in 1983 to try to draw socalled reagan democrats back 
to the fold members of that group influenced dukakis choice of 
texas sen lloyd bentsen as vice presidential nominee jackson said 
this is the time for the dlc to make its presence felt he 
said

freezing temperatures and shifting winds 
combined to shut off all escape routes for three stranded whales 
tuesday as rescuers readied for a dangerous goforbroke attempt 
to free the animals 
the effort has become a race against time complicated by the 
wind bitter cold and shifting ice the young california gray 
whales early tuesday were tired at least one may have pneumonia 
their barnacleencrusted snouts were worn raw from grating on the 
jagged ice surrounding their tiny breathing holes 
at prudhoe bay some 200 miles to the southeast an army 
national guard skycrane helicopter was rigged to hook onto a 
185ton icebreaking hovercraft barge owned by veco inc for the 
tricky journey across the desolate arctic ocean to reach the whales 
but late tuesday the trip was put on hold until wednesday 
morning the journey was delayed when the barge became stuck in the 
ice then for refueling before the barge was moved a short distance 
late tuesday 
col tom carroll of the alaska army national guard said the 
barge was pulled from the dock but it moved slowly 
mike haller a national guard spokesman said crews would work 
through the night to lighten the barge by removing fuel 
were looking at seeing if it makes things a little 
smoother he said well go after it again at first light 
tomorrow 
the whales whose length ranges from 24 to 30 feet became 
trapped nearly two weeks ago while migrating south to warmer 
waters they were hemmed in by new ice 18 miles northeast of this 
inupiat eskimo village the whales are in shallow water only a few 
hundred feet offshore 
the trip from prudhoe bay to point barrow is expected to take 
2540 hours and crews must be careful authorities said if the tow 
cable were to snap and wrap in the helicopter rotors it could be 
disastrous 
president reagan telephoned the commander of the operation to 
offer his support telling him that americans hearts are with 
you and our prayers are also with you 
i just wanted to tell you that everybody down here their 
hearts are with you and our prayers are also with you reagan 
told carroll 
marvin king veco chief of operations at prudhoe bay said the 
barge was ready to go tuesday but would not budge workers freed 
the barge later tuesday 
the helicopter cannot lift the barge said haller the skycranes 
can only lift about 22500 pounds but when the barge is on its air 
cushion the aircraft will be towing only about 18000 pounds he 
said 
the barge pulverizes ice with a combination of its weight and 
the vibration from its engines 
the effort had been scheduled to begin monday but was delayed 
when it was discovered the barge needed repairs 
a national weather service analysis of the ice in the point 
barrow area monday provided little hope for the animals 
a satellite photo shows the nearest open water is 200 miles to 
the west in the chukchi sea he said the next ice analysis was 
scheduled for wednesday 
last week the ice around the whales breathing holes was so 
thin that biologists did not dare walk on it by early tuesday the 
ice was 1824 inches thick the california gray whales despite 
their size and mass have shown no inclination to bull their way 
through the ice pack 
haller said authorities were aware of the analysis but were 
going ahead with the attempt were committed to this haller 
said were going to go ahead and see what happens 
as the world watched and waited biologists and north slope 
residents worked with chainsaws to keep the whales small breathing 
holes open one of the holes is 24by20 feet the other 24by10 
biologists said they were overwhelmed by the interest shown in 
the trapped whales the drama has prompted scores of calls from 
people with ideas to free the animals they ranged from using 
explosives or dropping bowling balls to break the ice to netting 
the animals for transport elsewhere 
every year probably dozens of grays drown or are crushed by 
the ice but nobody ever knows about it said north slope 
biologist craig george 
to underscore his point 20 miles offshore the flipper of a 
bowhead whale is frozen in the ice and has attracted more than a 
halfdozen foraging polar bears biologists said they were 
surprised the bears had not found the stranded gray whales the 
scientists have begun carrying shotguns onto the ice just in case 
the bears get lucky 
nobody was sure how long the whales could last they have been 
swimming against a current since they were trapped exhaustion 
could kill them but food is not a likely problem biologists said 
the gray whales feed on the bottom stirring up organisms that 
they filter through fingerlike projections called baleen these 
guys are kind of the vacuum cleaners of the whale family george 
said but all members of the great whale family have the ability 
to fast for long periods 
he said the whales had just completed their summer feeding 
period and should have started their ordeal in peak condition gray 
whales usually do not feed much as they migrate south he said 
the whales were spotted because they were trapped relatively 
close to shore and biologists stationed in the area were alerted 
the population of endangered california gray whales numbers 
about 20000 and has been growing at an annual average of 25 
percent for the past decade authorities said 
the whales spend their winters in the warm waters off mexico and 
southern california

dan quayle drug czar 
we think thats a fairly frightening thought that people need 
to be reminded of says dave dalessandro ad chief for 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
the dukakis campaign scheduled a network television ad on the 
theme starting today the ad criticizes republican george bushs 
proposal to put quayle his running mate in charge of the nations 
war on drugs 
the ad says cocaine traffic rose 300 percent drugs in the 
schools increased and panamanian drug lord noriega was kept on 
the government payroll while bush himself was in charge of the 
reagan administration effort to stem the flow of drugs into this 
country 
and now george bush wants to put dan quayle in charge for the 
next four years the ad says showing a debate clip of quayle 
saying hell be coordinating the drug effort if george bush 
couldnt handle the job how do you think dan quayle is gonna do 
the ad concludes 
the dukakis offensive came a day after bush began airing an ad 
telling viewers the massachusetts governor has opposed virtually 
every defense system we developed a charge the dukakis campaign 
says is false 
the bush ad shows a helmeted dukakis riding a tank a campaign 
appearance that was designed to counter his antimilitary image but 
ended up backfiring with voters 
he opposed new aircraft carriers he opposed antisatellite 
weapons he opposed four missile systems including the pershing 2 
missile deployment michael dukakis opposed the stealth bomber and 
a ground emergency warning system against nuclear attack he even 
criticized our rescue mission to grenada and our strike on libya 
the ad says now he wants to be our commanderinchief america 
cant afford that risk 
dukakis spokeswoman lorraine voles called the spot just more 
distortions from the bush campaign she said dukakis did not 
oppose the actions in libya and grenada and supports the stealth 
bomber and the trident 2 seabased missile 
he opposes two missile systems the midgetman and the mobile mx 
but has said he would work with congress to find a sensible 
affordable way to maintain the effectiveness of the landbased leg 
of the defense triad voles said 
she said dukakis also supports the development of a new advanced 
tactical fighter and nuclear attack submarines 
since friday the dukakis campaign has been running two ads 
nationwide both of them lowkey relatively positive spots 
featuring dukakis talking directly into the camera about family 
concerns and americas international economic status 
bush has been running two network ads that tout his 
international experience one says he led the way on the recent 
ussoviet arms reduction treaty and the other says he would be 
ready immediately after taking office to negotiate with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev while dukakis would have to be trained 
for the job 
both campaigns continued to run regional television advertising 
much of it focused on crime and environmental issues in key states 
such as california and texas and dukakis began a new series of 
economic spots in ohio all three produced by jerry austin who 
managed jesse jacksons presidential campaign 
the new spots which may be used elsewhere in the midwest focus 
on dukakis plan to help families buy their first homes the loss 
of us jobs to foreign workers and bushs record as chairman of a 
commission examining usjapanese trade relations 
both campaigns are planning television drives to woo hispanic 
voters the dukakis ads scheduled to start this week in 
highintensity hispanic areas bush also plans a large tv drive 
aimed at hispanic voters closer to the nov 8 election

prime minister yitzhak shamir flanked by a 
crowd of cheering supporters rode a city bus through palestinian 
neighborhoods where israeli passengers often face stonethrowing 
attacks 
supporters shouted shamir shamir and clapped their hands 
tuesday as the no 25 bus rolled through the arab village of 
shuafat in arab east jerusalem on its way to the jewish 
neighborhood of neve yaakov 
hours later police fired rubber bullets at arab stonethrowers 
near shuafat injuring one a police spokesman said 
shamir who leads the rightwing likud bloc made the symbolic 
gesture shortly after declaring that the 10monthold palestinian 
uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip was a useless 
struggle 
the future of the occupied territories is a key campaign issue 
in the nov 1 national elections 
shamir opposes territorial concessions his main rival foreign 
minister shimon peres of the leftleaning labor party favors a 
landforpeace deal with israels arab neighbors 
israel will never move under the pressure of the uprising 
shamir told reporters in jerusalem all of this suffering all of 
these victims it doesnt bring any results therefore it will 
come to an end 
at least 301 palestinians have died since violence broke out 
dec 8 in the west bank and gaza strip captured by israel in the 
1967 middle east war six israelis also have died 
peres meanwhile warned tuesday that keeping the territories 
where 15 million palestinians live could lead to israeli 
annexation of the region and create an arab majority in the jewish 
state 
some israelis want to give up the people and not the land 
peres told members of the usbased united jewish appeal we 
never would agree to become a nation of slaves and we should not be 
tempted to become a nation of masters 
peres said balloting should be held in the occupied lands so a 
delegation can be elected to represent the palestinians alongside 
jordan in peace talks with israel 
shamir called peres peace plan unworkable and dismissed the 
call for elections as a campaign gimmick that people will forget 
about 
a poll published tuesday in the daily maariv newspaper showed 
that 30 percent of the 1200 israelis questioned supported 
annexation while 24 percent favored joint israelipalestinian rule 
over the territories without plo participation 
israel refuses to deal with the palestine liberation 
organization which it views as a terrorist group 
the radical moledet homeland movement which advocates 
expulsion of palestinians from the occupied territories broadcast 
its first campaign ad tuesday 
the ad featured a sternlooking rehovoam zeevi the party leader 
and a retired army general telling voters peace can be achieved 
by separation of two peoples now it is time to transfer arabs 
from the occupied lands pictures of arab rioters appeared in 
the background 
zeevis moledet and the likud are expected to benefit from 
tuesdays supreme court decision barring the antiarab kach 
movement led by usborn rabbi meir kahane from participating in 
the elections 
the court in a 50 ruling said kahanes antiarab party 
incites racism and negates the democratic character of the 
state 
the court also ruled 32 that the progressive list for peace a 
leftist party that advocates an independent palestinian state 
alongside israel could take part in the elections 
the likud and other rightwing parties have demanded that the 
plp be disqualified on grounds it threatened to destroy the jewish 
character of the state

glasnost could come to this american 
television ads proclaiming zhiguli the czar of beers when 
youre out of zhiguli youre out of beer 
its pronounced zeeguhlee as in the bestselling beer in the 
soviet union 
and if a new joint venture between the soviet government and 
american investors is successful zhiguli will be just one of a 
number of soviet products trying to make a dent in the giant 
american market 
the group also has high hopes for laggidze waters a 
fruitflavored soft drink made from mineral waters from the 
georgian region of the soviet union 
the new joint venture called torg international the russian 
word for trade was launched tuesday with toasts of soviet 
champagne at the soviet embassy 
the participants credited soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs 
campaign of perestroika the economic restructuring designed to 
overhaul the stagnant soviet economy as the guiding force behind 
the new effort 
this is a joint venture with the aim of selling in the united 
states some soviet goods soviet soft drinks soviet beer soviet 
candies soviet chocolates perhaps some other goods of high 
quality said soviet ambassador yuriy dubinin it is one more 
step in the development of sovietamerican relations 
the new company which is 51 percent owned by american investors 
and 49 percent owned by the soviet government will have exclusive 
marketing rights in the united states for a range of products 
including beer soft drinks wine brandies vegetables nuts 
fruits and other types of food 
while american companies have often formed joint ventures in 
order to do business in the soviet union this will be the first 
between a us company and the soviet government in this country 
any profits will be split between the american investors and the 
soviet government 
plans call for laggidze lahgeedzee waters to begin appearing 
on store shelves by next may followed shortly thereafter by 
zhiguli beer 
officials in the new enterprise said they were undaunted by the 
huge advertising budgets or market shares now held by american 
softdrink giants 
these are not your traditional american soft drinks said 
george carroll who will serve as president of torg international 
these soft drinks are 100 percent natural products there is no 
caffeine no additives of any kind there is no sugar 
as an added selling feature the mineral water comes from the 
mountains of georgia the region of the soviet union famous for the 
longevity of its residents carroll said 
he said his company the cleveland export import trade co was 
prepared to spend 10 million initially in starting the new 
enterprise 
while the company that produces laggidze waters has been around 
for 100 years the soviets bottling process is so antiquated that 
all of the labels are still put on by hand 
carroll said the american investors would be sending 
labelpasting machines to the soviet union along with filtration 
systems to increase the shelflife of the soft drinks 
carroll said the soviet products will be aimed at the same 
upscale market that buys stolichnaya the soviet vodka 
we are not upgrading the quality of their goods the quality 
of their goods is excellent carroll said what we are doing is 
helping them with the logistics of marketing 
carroll said the soft drinks will be introduced first followed 
by the zhiguli beer and then wine and soviet champagne 
since gorbachev met with us businessmen on his trip to the 
united states last year the soviets have stepped up their efforts 
to interest western businesses in doing business with the soviet 
government 
vadin ignatov vice chairman of the soviet agricultural 
ministry said tuesday that another of his countrys goals is to 
use the technical expertise learned in the new joint venture to 
increase the quantity and quality of consumer goods available to 
soviet consumers 
we think this joint venture will be in the interest of both 
the american and soviet people he said i think this is very 
significant that the first major trade we are going to be doing is 
something as peaceful as soft drinks

donations to charity decrease as incomes 
increase according to a gallup poll which says low and 
moderateincome americans are more generous than their upperincome 
counterparts 
giving and volunteering in america is a stark contrast between 
heartwarming generosity and bonechilling selfishness said 
brian oconnell president of the independent sector a nonprofit 
coalition of 650 corporate foundation and volunteer organizations 
which commissioned the survey 
the march survey of 2775 adults 18 years and over produced 
profiles of the most and least generous americans according to 
income family status church membership community size and region 
those most likely to make contributions and volunteer their time 
were members of low to moderateincome families churchgoers 
rural residents and midwesterners 
the least generous were the affluent single individuals the 
nonchurchgoing city dwellers and southerners 
contrary to popular opinion the welltodo in america cannot 
be described as generous oconnell said 
oconnell said at a press conference tuesday that contributing 
households with incomes below 10000 gave an average of 28 
percent of their income to charity those with incomes from 10000 
to 29999 gave 25 percent while those between 30000 and 
49999 gave 2 percent 
contributing households with incomes between 50000 to 74999 
gave 15 percent those earning 75000 to 99999 donated 17 
percent and those with incomes of 100000 or more gave 21 
percent 
overall the survey found that 70 percent of the households in 
america make charitable contributions 
the average amount of annual contributions per household was 
790 
members of almost half of the households 45 percent also 
volunteered time to charitable activities the average per 
household was 47 hours a week in 1987 
extrapolated to the entire us population the figures would 
translate into 80 million people giving a total of 195 billion 
hours worth 150 billion in time contributed oconnell said 
the study indicated a link between religion and charitable 
support with 79 percent of church members contributing money and 
51 percent volunteering time among nonmembers 55 percent made 
donations and 33 percent volunteered time 
however more than one in five of the church members 22 
percent contributed only to religion and not to any other 
charities 
eugene c dorsey head of the groups give five campaign to 
increase volunteerism said the study shows it is possible to reach 
the organizations goal of motivating americans to donate at least 
5 percent of their incomes and five hours a week apiece to the 
causes of their choice 
but dorsey who also serves as president of the gannett 
foundation said the findings also confirm the need for 
establishment of a basic standard of what we owe to our 
communities 
virginia a hodgkinson the coalitions vice president for 
research said its previous surveys had missed the link between 
rising income and decreasing support for charity she said the 
earlier studies measured only the amount given without regard to 
what percentage of income the donated amount represented 
she said the profiles of the most and least generous americans 
were based on the averages for weekly volunteerism contributions 
as percentage of income and the percentages of family members who 
were volunteers 
using this formula the midwest was first with individual 
volunteers donating 25 hours of their time and 15 percent of 
their income followed by the west 24 hours 15 percent of 
income the east 20 hours 12 percent and the south 18 
hours 17 percent 
although those questioned in the south reported giving a greater 
percentage of earnings to charity hodgkinson said this group had a 
lower overall proportion of households with volunteers and fewer 
volunteers overall in the general population 
rankings by size of community using the same criteria were 
rural 24 hours 18 percent of income suburban 22 hours 15 
percent and city 20 hours 13 percent 
married people gave an average of 25 hours a week and donated 
15 percent of their income compared with singles who gave 2 hours 
a week and just 05 percent of their income 
those with three or more children gave 27 hours a week and 
donated 2 percent of their income compared with 25 hours and 14 
per cent of income for those with fewer children

a panel of federal appellate judges is 
suggesting that random testing for drug use by air traffic 
controllers and guards at chemicalweapons depots might be 
justified by concerns about safety 
an attorney for two employees unions was confronted with sharp 
questioning about the safety issue at a hearing tuesday about drug 
testing of nearly 30000 transportation department and 9400 
civilian army employees 
doesnt the government have a legitimate employer concern in 
finding out whether the guard watching that nerve gas is on 
hardline drugs circuit judge abner mikva asked union attorney 
joe goldberg during the hearing 
we all placidly and docilely go through the airport metal 
detectors said patricia wald chief judge of the us circuit 
court of appeals here why not put the guy minding the nerve gas 
on the same side as airport detection of potential hijackers she 
asked 
goldberg argued that the test the government was using was an 
unconstitutional invasion of privacy because it could not determine 
whether an employee was impaired by drug use while on the job 
all the urine test can do is determine that an employee had used 
illegal drugs in the past five days he said 
before the government can cast its net over assumedly 
nonusing employees there must be some reason for the invasion 
into the private lives of employees that has some relationship to 
workrelated conduct goldberg said 
he urged the appeals court to apply the standard it adopted last 
year when it said testing of district of columbia school employees 
was justified as part of physicals if the test could predict 
onthejob impairment 
but during repeated questioning by wald mikva and circuit judge 
david sentelle goldberg conceded that a positive test for an 
employee in a sensitive job might raise proper concerns over 
whether the person could do the job safely 
in certain positions a positive drug test could very well 
have an employment nexus goldberg said 
why is not that the end of the argument wald said 
goldberg said that still didnt resolve the issue of whether the 
government could justify a warrantless random search without 
suspicions of drug use by particular people 
the question is is the test justified in its inception and is 
it narrowly related in scope he said 
assistant attorney general john bolton argued that the 
government had taken the step of limiting drug testing to a very 
narrowly defined category of individuals including guards at 
nervegas arsenals and a base where directedenergy laser weapons 
are being tested 
the transportation department testing which was upheld last 
year by a lower court judge covers air traffic controllers 
drivers airplane inspectors sky marshals and other sensitive 
and critical positions 
the army program was declared unconstitutional earlier this year 
by another federal judge in the case brought by the american 
federation of government employees and the national federation of 
federal employees 
a ruling on both cases might be held up until the court receives 
word next spring from the supreme court on two other cases 
involving drug testing 
the high court is set to hear arguments nov 2 on testing of 
railroad crews after accidents and us customs service agents 
seeking promotions 
mikva voiced concern that employees with prostate problems might 
lose their jobs if they couldnt provide a urine sample within a 
twohour period mandated by the regulations 
bolton replied that two hours was a reasonable time period 
i wont put you to the test mr bolton mikva said

the soviet union has cut back on the amount of 
arms it is providing to nicaragua but reagan administration 
officials say they doubt soviet support for the sandinista regime 
has diminished 
the arms shipments are down in dollar value and tonnage dan 
howard the pentagons chief spokesman said tuesday 
apparently its a move from the supplying of heavy equipment 
everything from bulldozers to tanks to artillery to providing 
them more sustainability like ammunition supplies you can draw 
your own conclusions about what that is about 
but we dont necessarily conclude that this means the soviets 
are backing off from their support for nicaragua certainly the 
warfighting capability of nicaragua has not gone down 
during the first nine months of the year the soviets and their 
warsaw pact allies shipped 13000 metric tons or about 14300 
regular tons of military equipment to nicaragua according to the 
latest defense department estimate 
by comparison shipments of soviet equipment during calendar 
1987 arrived at an average rate of 1808 metric tons per month or 
16272 metric tons for the first nine months of 1987 that 
translates to 17899 regular tons 
the drop in tonnage in 1988 also is reflected by intelligence 
estimates of the dollar value of the arms received 
the pentagon estimated the materiel delivered during the first 
nine months of this year was worth 350 million shipments in 1987 
were worth about 42 million a month or about 378 million for 
nine months 
during all of 1987 the nicaraguans received 21700 metric tons 
of arms valued at 505 million the defense department estimates 
despite evidence of an arms slowdown howard said nicaragua was 
still maintaining the largest military force in the region and that 
thanks to previous arms deliveries theyre extraordinarily well 
armed and constitute a threat to their neighbors 
the slowdown in deliveries to the sandinistas comes at a time 
when american military aid to the contra guerrillas has been cut 
off completely for eight months the reagan administration under 
congressional pressure ended its military assistance to the rebels 
at the end of february three weeks before a truce and ceasefire 
took effect 
the truce has failed to produce a permanent peace and 
skirmishes are still being reported between sandinista forces and 
the rebels absent a major sandinista offensive however president 
reagan announced last week he would not attempt to win 
congressional approval for more lethal aid 
until this year soviet arms shipments to the sandinistas have 
climbed steadily rising from only about 16 metric tons in 1980 to 
a record 22000 metric tons in 1986 and last years nearrecord 
21700 metric tons

the commander of us military forces in 
the middle east says he believes american journalists tell the 
story better than we do and should be given as much access to 
military operations as possible 
gen george b crist commander of us central command said 
officials should not try to interfere with reporting of adverse 
developments or incidents that reflect unfavorably on the military 
theres always the chance of terrible things but were going 
to tell them anyway if it goes wrong right if we had a disaster 
out there were going to have to say it anyway so we might as 
well have the press out there to see what the hell happened and 
explain it he said 
crist a fourstar marine corps general retires next month 
after three years in charge of us military affairs in the middle 
east he made his remarks in an interview during a farewell tour of 
the persian gulf 
the navys gulf operation during the past 17 months is its 
largest undertaking since vietnam costing 15 million to 20 
million a month according to pentagon estimates 
in terms of shooting at ships and other things weve done its 
the biggest since world war ii said capt donald dvornik a 
senior aide to crist 
crist himself noted that some historians described a oneday 
series of clashes with iran on april 18 as the biggest us naval 
engagement since the battle of leyte gulf in 1944 
the united states now has 26 warships in the region including 
10 in the gulf but plans cutbacks if the aug 20 ceasefire 
continues to hold the truce ended eight years of hostilities 
between iraq and iran 
crist indicated that his views on news media coverage of 
military operations were strongly shaped by the 1983 invasion of 
grenada in which the pentagon barred the media from accompanying 
us forces 
that decision was seen as contributing to highly negative news 
coverage of the mission which the reagan administration said was 
to prevent a cubanbacked communist takeover of the caribbean 
island 
the grenada dispute led the pentagon to set up standing 
pools of print and broadcast reporters to cover us military 
operations the system itself controversial saw its first test 
under combat conditions in the gulf 
during the year ending last july rotating groups of journalists 
were allowed to report from aboard navy warships their material 
was not censored but was subject to security review to screen 
out militarily sensitive information 
crist who is described by subordinates as a securityconscious 
taskmaster witnessed the grenada invasion as a pentagon staff 
officer working for the joint chiefs of staff 
if we had brought the correspondents in the second day after 
the heavy fighting was over and let them see what i saw it would 
have been different coverage he said 
and i was convinced when we came out here that i wasnt going 
to do that the american press gives better coverage they tell 
the story better than we do 
he said he had seen instances where the news was coming as 
fast as we knew what was going on we and you and the american 
public were all getting it about the same time and they all 
learned that great lesson never believe the first report

laserprotected homes pocket telephones and 
interactive television will be commonplace in the united states of 
the future but the nation could face a potentially devastating 
aids epidemic and a growing threat from hightech terrorists 
researchers say 
in its annual summary of predictions the world future society 
says aids could have the impact of a world war by the end of the 
century 
the predictions for 1989 and beyond summarize but do not 
detail reports published during the past year by the society a 
nonprofit educational group based in bethesda md which 
encourages study of issues affecting the future 
on the positive side the society foresees technological 
advances in the home improved quality of life in americas cities 
and better working conditions as corporations give more attention 
to job satisfaction 
workers over age 50 will find a growing demand for their 
stability and experience the report said 
company policies in support of families will become much more 
common as the baby boom generation moves into the upper echelon of 
management these will include onsite child care flexible working 
hours and sick leave for childrens illnesses 
among the societys other projections 
city downtowns will become more livable many will plant trees 
and establish cultural and entertainment facilities such as arts 
districts childrens museums and aquariums shopping areas will 
increasingly be combined with educational cultural and 
entertainment facilities 
many homes will be protected by laser shields and artificial 
intelligence security systems with surveillance by heatsensitive 
monitors and even satellites becoming possible 
pocketsized telephones will become available someday 
replacing public phones 
interactive television will play a large role in the classroom 
of the future giving students in remote locations the ability to 
see hear and talk to a professor hundreds of miles away 
businesses will need to provide continuous employee training as 
the automation and computer revolutions eliminate many lowliteracy 
jobs 
computers will become a popular target for terrorists attacks 
on hightech targets such as computer networks telecommunications 
facilities and defense computers could pose a major threat 
fraud may become the crime of choice in the future as america 
grows older replacing burglary which requires the speed and 
agility of youth 
new discoveries in biotechnology and genetic engineering could 
lead to the replacement of nerve cells arteries hormoneproducing 
cells and even brain cells artificial implants will become more 
common 
coastal structures ranging from cottages to airports built on 
reclaimed land will face a threat from rising sea levels as the 
greenhouse effect melts the polar ice caps 
major disease problems of the next century will include 
immunesystem disorders viral conditions bacteria that have 
become resistant to todays antibiotics allergies to new chemicals 
and mental health problems such as alcoholism drug dependence and 
mood disorders 
the society says total deaths from aids acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome could top 50 million worldwide in the 1990s 
more than the black death of the middle ages the world health 
organization recently estimated that as many as 10 million people 
worldwide now have aids and that another 1 million victims could be 
recorded by 1993 
but the society says the crisis brought by aids could spur a 
boom in medical research that might avoid a plague while also 
benefiting people suffering from other diseases another positive 
side effect could be establishment of national health insurance 
systems the futurists say 
aids is a contagious disease that attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections the virus most often is spread through close contact 
with blood blood products or semen from infected persons 
as of oct 10 aids had been diagnosed in 75437 americans of 
whom 42432 had died according to the federal centers for disease 
control no one is known to have recovered from aids 
the societys summary of predictions is being published in the 
novemberdecember issue of its futurist magazine

a technician who plugged an 
electrical cable into the wrong slot is being blamed by nasa for a 
flash electrical fire that damaged the 216 million magellan probe 
being readied for a mission to venus 
the space agency reported tuesday the damage was not serious and 
would take five to seven days to repair officials said there would 
be no impact on magellans launch aboard the space shuttle 
atlantis scheduled for april 
smoke and a 2to3inch flame spurted from a spacecraft battery 
when a worker tried to insert a cable connector into the wrong 
receptacle monday night vince wirth a project spokesman told a 
news conference tuesday 
technicians on the scene quickly put out the fire within a 
minute with a halon fire extinguisher wirth said but by then 
the damage was done it resulted in a short that damaged the 
battery and wire harness and insulation blankets near the battery 
wirth played a videotape that showed some soot damage around the 
battery area the battery he explained was being used to run 
routine power system checks in the spacecrafts forward equipment 
module and is not part of the flight equipment 
he said magellan because of its planetary mission must be 
contaminationfree and that the soot would have to be carefully 
removed by cleaning experts flown here from nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory in pasadena calif and from martin marietta in denver 
where the craft was built 
because an electrical short was involved engineers were 
checking to make certain there was no damage to other electrical 
components such as the spacecraft signal processor wirth said 
apparently the wrong plug was put in the power supply james 
c fletcher national aeronautics and space administration 
administrator told reporters in washington i dont know whether 
you ever tried to put a multipronged plug into a socket but its 
hard to do it wouldnt fit so he pushed it a little bit and it 
shorted out the battery 
we shouldnt allow this kind of stuff fletcher added 
its a human error well have an investigation and take some 
steps so it wont happen in the future 
wirth said the technician who made the mistake worked for martin 
marietta which delivered magellan here oct 8 the spacecraft is 
being assembled and checked in a processing building and when 
complete it will stand 21 feet and weigh 7800 pounds 
wirth said because of the recent delivery many electrical 
components still had not been installed reducing the possibility 
of damage and several protective shipping covers were still in 
place cutting down on the spread of soot 
atlantis astronauts are to release magellan from the shuttle 
cargo bay starting it on 446day voyage to venus the craft is to 
orbit the planet and map its surface with a radar camera

gambling helped build the reputation of 
this black hills town where wild bill hickok was gunned down during 
a poker game 112 years ago now city officials hope a return to 
gambling will help preserve it 
voters statewide will be asked nov 8 to approve a 
constitutional amendment allowing the legislature to permit limited 
gambling in deadwood with the proceeds dedicated to preservation of 
historic buildings deadwood voters also would have to approve the 
final plan by 60 percent 
weve always said deadwood has the potential to be the aspen 
of the midwest said bill walsh an owner of the franklin hotel 
at one end of the colorful main street he said he wants to see 
gambling limited to a few card tables and slot machines in existing 
establishments 
walsh said gambling will draw more visitors yeararound 
creating more jobs in service industries and pumping dollars into 
the economy of the entire black hills 
but others oppose gambling on moral grounds and say the 
constitution shouldnt be changed for the sake of one town 
im opposed to any kind of gambling said the rev dick 
ward a united methodist minister in rapid city who is mobilizing 
opposition statewide it preys on people that are weak it gives 
them the idea that they are going to get rich quick 
south dakotas 99yearold constitution forbids games of chance 
but allows the legislature to approve gambling for charitable 
religious educational or public spirited purposes in 1986 voters 
amended the document to allow a staterun lottery which began last 
year 
other attempts to approve gambling have failed including one 
that would have allowed all communities to make local decisions on 
games of chance 
but city officials claim widespread support for gambling they 
say people are committed to historic preservation and the money 
has to come from somewhere 
mayor tom blair said it will take about 20 million to save more 
than 100 buildings he said his town of 1800 people is overwhelmed 
by the task of restoring and preserving the buildings deadwood 
built a century ago when 10000 people lived in this boisterous 
mining community 
we have had a real unique stewardship handed to us by the 
national park service blair said adding that deadwood is the 
only entire city in south dakota to be registered as a national 
landmark 
age neglect and fire threaten to destroy that legacy unless 
expensive restoration begins right away the mayor said 
the city got a painful reminder of that last december when fire 
destroyed two historic buildings in the heart of the commercial 
district stopping at the wall of saloon no 10 where hickok the 
frontier marshal was shot to death aug 2 1876 while playing 
poker 
i think its true that a lot of people had their eyes opened 
up on this after this fire said herb haist city planner 
most of the citys buildings were erected in the 20 years 
between 1880 and 1900 blair said earlier buildings were lost in 
previous fires 
stately brick buildings now turned into tourist shops line 
both sides of historic main street grand houses perch recklessly 
on the steep sides of deadwood gulch forming a city seven blocks 
wide and three miles long 
people across south dakota should vote for the amendment the 
future in mind walsh said so south dakotans can say hey we 
saved deadwood we saved a part of our past

the major opposition party has issued a 
platform calling for an end to burmas policy of isolation and the 
replacement of the socialist economy with a free enterprise system 
a ninepage policy statement issued tuesday by the the national 
league for democracy said it would seek closer relations with 
foreign countries along with foreign investments and would 
participate in international and regional economic organizations 
but few observers gave the national league a chance of winning 
elections even if they are held 
after weeks of violent political protests the militarybacked 
government reasserted control on sept 18 but allowed the formation 
of opposition political parties and promised general elections but 
set no date 
so far 22 parties have registered including the ruling national 
unity party that has wielded power for the past 26 years 
the ruling party and military have been in control since the 
coup in 1962 led by ne win who stepped down in july ne wins 
government adopted isolationatism and socialism and waged war 
against a dozen insurgent groups seeking greater autonomy from the 
central government 
the national league for democracy is headed by exdefense 
minister tin oo former military officer aung gyi and aung san suu 
kyi the daughter of the legendary freedom fighter aung san 
in its policy statment the league said nationalized firms would 
be returned to their original owners and all but a few state 
enterprises vital to the nation would be privatized 
it said the first priority would be ending the insurgencies by 
various ethnic groups that are draining the countrys resources 
and hampering development 
foreign investments will be permitted and a favorable 
investment climate will be created by introducing measures such as 
nonnationalization guarantees and favorable tax and labor laws in 
accordance with international practice the statement said 
it also said ownership of land would be restored to the farmers 
who would be allowed to grow and market their produce freely 
peasant and workers unions independent of party politics will 
be encouraged as class organizations to protect their legitimate 
righjts the statement said 
radio rangoon announced tuesday that a curfew in effect since 
sept 18 has been shortened by one hour and will now be enforced 
from 9 pm to 4 am but it did not say if the order affected 
rangoon only or the entire country 
the government has said more than 450 persons have been killed 
in the crackdown ordered last month to restore order 
independent estimates put the death toll much higher

pentagon military leaders are resisting 
suggested cuts of up to 3500 jobs that civilian defense officials 
claim can be eliminated without harming security 
the joint chiefs of staff is arguing that no more than 500 
positions should be cut from us military commands worldwide 
while civilian manpower authorities believe the figure should be 
between 3000 and 3500 officials said tuesday 
the two sides are not even close to agreement on a figure 
said one official who spoke on condition he not be identified 
the military guys are already starting to cry that they cant do 
more with less 
sources said the dispute is scheduled to be resolved by defense 
secretary frank c carlucci in time to be reflected in the fiscal 
1990 budget when it is submitted to congress in january 
you can be sure that carlucci is going to force more than 500 
cuts out of the military but its hard to predict how many more 
said one source 
and since its a lameduck budget submission his decision may 
or may not hold added another official he is serious about 
this though 
the current fight dates to an internal study ordered by carlucci 
last december shortly after he assumed the post of defense 
secretary 
the study was performed by a 22member panel chaired by derek j 
vander schaaf the pentagons deputy inspector general in 
unusually blunt terms it concluded in february the pentagon could 
eliminate 7309 jobs from headquarters around the world or 12 
percent of the total without jeopardizing readiness 
such cuts would save more than 300 million a year in operating 
costs and eliminate duplication that in some cases almost 
guarantees americas military forces will have a hard time fighting 
any war the study asserted 
the panel found the unified and specified commands around the 
world were supported by 59510 civilian and military staff adding 
the review disclosed significant areas of overlapping 
responsibilities duplication of functions layering and 
opportunities for saving manpower 
the panels conclusion that 7309 jobs were superfluous was sent 
for review by the pentagons office for force management and 
personnel and then by the joint chiefs of staff the sixmember 
body that includes the nations highestranking admirals and 
generals 
one source said the pentagons civilian manpower officials do 
not agree with the 7309 figure but certainly found plenty of 
room for cutting adding that they recommended cuts of up to 
3500 jobs 
thats not even half of what vander schaaf recommended but 
the joints chiefs still says its totally unacceptable the 
source said 
the study panel criticized by name several commands as 
overstaffed or unnecessary including the us forces caribbean 
command in key west fla the armys western command in hawaii 
the strategic air command and the separate air and ground defense 
command structures for alaska 
the panel also suggested 286 positions could be slashed from the 
staff of the joint chiefs itself which now numbers 2005

most of the 250000 honeybees that broke 
free from an overturned tractortrailer in rush hour traffic have 
been killed or caught but state officials are still a mite worried 
or worried that is about a mite 
the state department of agriculture on tuesday quaranteed four 
metropolitan atlanta counties to ensure that the parasite found on 
some of the bees doesnt contaminate local hives 
samples analyzed from the bees showed traces of the varroa 
jacobsoni mite which attacks adult and young bees said 
agriculture department spokesman carlton moor it can cause bee 
mutations and spreads quickly through the hive but poses no threat 
to humans 
the quarantine means no bees can be moved in or out of cobb 
fulton cherokee and dekalb counties until the department verifies 
the area is free from the varroa mite 
the bees were released from 200 hives that shattered when the 
18wheel flatbed tractortrailer hauling them from wisconsin to 
florida flipped over monday afternoon at the intersection of 
interstates 75 and 285 north of atlanta 
witnesses said the collective hum of the insects was loud enough 
to be heard above the sound of car radios as they swarmed through a 
busy intersection no one however reported being stung 
state workers aided by private beekeepers used a gardengrade 
insecticide to kill a whopping pile of them monday night said 
department of transportation worker william haithcock 
moore said the department was concerned that some of the 
beekeepers that showed up to round up the escaped bees monday 
carried them back to their own hives 
the bees were being shipped by west virginiabased jimco from 
dodgeville wis to de land fla said jimco dispatcher john 
holbrook in de land

dont look now but the drought is still with 
us 
sure the photos of stranded barges and withered corn have 
disappeared from the front pages of newspapers and the evening news 
shows 
and it has rained a bit most places quite a bit in some 
but that doesnt mean all is well 
the longterm drought is still there said david miskus 
editor of weekly climate bulletin produced by the climate analysis 
center at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
the dryness isnt as bad today as it was a situation 
illustrated by the fact that the special weekly drought advisory 
issued by the climate analysis center was discontinued sept 29 
with the conclusion that the summer had been the driest since 1936 
but that final report added that chances were not favorable 
for ending the drought in the most severely affected midwestern 
states by nov 30 
miskus calculates that the midwestern drought is now 31 weeks 
old 
the problem is that the northern great plains and northern 
rockies are entering into their normally dry period things 
dont look too good unless something unusual happens he said 
the northern plains states dont normally get a lot of rain at 
this time of year and after the dry summer they are so far behind 
that without abnormally heavy rains it will take a long time to 
recover said thomas headinghouse editor of the weekly weather and 
crop bulletin of the department of agriculture 
areas of the corn belt are also extremely dry they did get 
some good rains in the eastern corn belt monday but on a 
longterm basis its still severely dry said headinghouse 
a series of cold fronts produced showers and thunderstorms over 
parts of the central great plains and upper midwest in september 
the climate analysis center reports 
but unusually dry conditions continued over large portions of 
the corn belt with many stations having received less than 60 
percent of normal rainfall since april 1 the center said 
planting the midwest winter wheat crop is off to a good start 
according to headinghouse but that grain depends on winter 
snowfall for moisture so farmers must wait and see what will 
develop in coming months 
some rain and snow fell on fire ravaged areas of yellowstone 
national park in september yet precipitation in most of idaho and 
wyoming was still less than 50 percent of normal for the month 
along the west coast conditions have improved somewhat but this 
should be the start of the rainy season there and rainfall hasnt 
begun to pick up significantly he noted 
the main area of recovery is the southeast headinghouse said 
with conditions especially wet along the gulf coast although 
rainfall continues to be lacking in the mountains of western north 
carolina 
but parts of the southeast have been suffering from unusual 
dryness for four or five years miskus added even though there has 
been considerable rain in the region in recent weeks many sections 
have experienced a shortage of 40 to 60 inches over the last few 
years 
i dont know how you ever make up for that miskus said 
low water is no longer stranding barges at memphis but the 
mississippi river remains below normal according to the us 
geological survey 
indeed with a daily flow of 102 billion gallons per day at 
vicksburg miss the river was some 44 percent below normal for 
the month of september the agency said 
the columbia river is also running low 40 percent below normal 
at the dalles ore the survey reported it averaged 375 billion 
gallons per day 
of the nations three largest rivers only the st lawrence was 
near normal last month just 6 percent low at massena ny it 
averaged 157 billion gallons a day topping the mississippi which 
usually carries the largest volume of water 
new england and the northeast which had been spared the worst 
of the summer drought experienced drier than normal conditions in 
september

sponsors of a congressional resolution on 
cambodia are dismayed by administration reluctance to take a 
stronger stand against chinese support for the marxist rebel group 
accused of the mass murder of cambodian civilians a decade ago 
on tuesday president reagan signed the resolution the main 
features of which call for an end to vietnams military presence in 
cambodia and efforts to ensure the khmer rouge which ruled 
cambodia for 3 bloody years in the late 1970s do not return to 
power 
the administration has said repeatedly there must be effective 
safeguards to ensure that the khmer rouge now a powerful 
guerrilla force do not achieve a dominant role again in cambodia 
nonetheless the state department fought hard during 
negotiations with the congress to protect the interests of the 
khmer rouges chief supplier china and the rebels other regional 
ally thailand 
a key clause in the original resolution asserted that the united 
states should attempt immediately to halt the flow of arms and 
military equipment to the khmer rouge at administration 
insistence the word immediately was deleted there were other 
changes which had the effect of watering down the resolution 
both china and thailand have as their highest priority the 
withdrawal of the vietnamese troops from cambodia and believe that 
the khmer rouge is in the best position to hasten that process 
china is worried about being encircled by prosoviet regimes and 
believes that public commitments by vietnam to withdraw from 
cambodia by 1990 are the direct result of khmer rouge military 
pressure according to administration officials 
the khmer rouge is the strongest of the three rebel groups 
fighting the prohanoi government in cambodia the other two both 
noncommunist are supported by the united states 
sen mark hatfield rore a senate sponsor of the resolution 
has said that the selfimposed silence of the american 
government enabled china to nurse the khmer rouge beast back 
to health 
the chief house sponsors stephen solarz dny chairman of 
the house foreign affairs subcommittee on east asian affairs and 
chester atkins dmass were out of town and unavailable for 
comment tuesday 
but aides said both were disheartened by the administrations 
deferential attitude toward china and thailand at the expense of a 
stronger stand against a group which is accused of killing between 
1 million and 2 million cambodians during their rule 
solarz and atkins acquiesced in the change fearing that a 
protracted fight over wording could have led to an impasse the 
aides said this could have meant congressional adjournment this 
week with no cambodia resolution at all 
a state department official insisting on anonymity said china 
is adamant on continuing its support for the khmer rouge and no 
amount of congressional pressure could alter the chinese position 
on that basis the administration fought the original wording of 
the resolution 
the official said china has come part way toward the 
administration view of the cambodian situation he noted that china 
indicated this past summer for the first time that the khmer rouge 
should not have a dominant role in the formation of a new 
government in cambodia once vietnam withdraws its troops

the mood in congress is still strongly against 
renewing military aid to nicaraguas rebel movement but the senate 
says that could change if the leftist government fails to comply 
with peace accords calling for more democracy 
the senate on tuesday approved a nonbinding sense of the 
senate resolution declaring its support for unspecified 
continuing efforts to strengthen the internal democratic 
opposition and the independent media of nicaragua 
it also called for maintaining the nicaraguan freedom fighters 
as one of the few pressure points on the sandinistas by providing 
the resistance urgently needed humanitarian assistance 
the dwindling contra forces are subsisting on 27 million in 
food clothing and medical supplies approved by congress last month 
as part of a pentagon money bill 
they havent received any weapons from the united states since 
february when lethal aid was suspended but congress has agreed to 
permit president reagan to request the release of 165 million in 
weapons if certain conditions are met 
reagan said last week he might call the congress into special 
session to release the aid should the sandinista forces strike hard 
against the contra guerrillas before the 101st congress convenes 
next january 
its important for the senate to send a message not only to 
the resistance in nicaragua but to people throughout the world 
said sen john mccain rariz 
mccain was the chief author of the nonbinding sense of the 
senate resolution it was approved on a voice vote after an 
earlier attempt to kill it was defeated 5412 
the resolution was attached to an unrelated bill affecting more 
than 6 million acres of federal wilderness lands in montana 
also attached to the bill before it was passed on a voice vote 
were resolutions endorsing chiles movement toward restoration of 
democracy and urging us allies to block soviet efforts to win the 
approval of loans worth millions of us dollars 
the legislation faces an uncertain future as congress heads 
toward adjournment the house has yet to approve it and any 
changes from the senatepassed legislation would have to be cleared 
by a housesenate conference committee 
the chilean proposal sponsored by sen tom harkin diowa was 
added to the contra measure on a voice vote 
chileans voted oct 5 to reject a new presidetial term for gen 
augusto pinochet the military leader who has ruled the nation 
since a 1973 coup overthrew the socialist civilian president 
salvador allende 
weve had a long night of despair in chile from the coup in 
1973 to until this year said harkin its incumbent on us to 
support the chilean people to support this election they had to 
say that we are going to work with them in this restoration of full 
democracy 
but sen jesse helms rnc termed the proposal a feelgood 
amendment and said pinochet had saved chile from going communist 
the soviet loan amendment approved 642 was proposed by sen 
steven symms ridaho 
he said the soviets are trying to secure loans of us dollars 
through third nations the soviets are using the eagerness of the 
western allies to play one nation off against another to get them 
to compete with each other for the opportunity to donate hard

the homely potato has turned glamorous as a 
us export item and is finding new ways of seducing american 
consumers says an agriculture department report 
powered by the popularity abroad of fastfood chains featuring 
french fries american potato exports are sizzling the 
departments economic research service said at home frozen use 
has never been higher and the microwave oven has given the fresh 
potato a new lease on life 
by next summer the agency said french fries will be available 
from vending machines in some cities oreida foods inc which 
plans to begin the operation says the machines will dispense 200 
servings of hot crispy fries in 3ounce portions at about 75 
cents per serving 
potatoes pull in nearly 1 of every 5 received by american 
vegetable producers said usda economist gary lucier 
in the last five years potato farmers grossed between 14 
billion and 19 billion annually exports of fresh potatoes have 
been relatively stable in recent years with canada receiving 
nearly all the shipments sales of frozen products however have 
soared to 112000 metric tons last year from 64000 tons in 1984 
with japan the biggest market 
lucier and other economists say in the october issue of farmline 
magazine that the potato industrys future growth will depend 
greatly on the new free trade agreement with canada and on us 
access to some foreign markets that have small entry quotas for 
potatoes 
the agreement with canada which is aimed at wiping out most 
trade barriers between the two countries was approved by congress 
and signed by president reagan on sept 28 it has not yet been 
cleared by the canadian parliament 
some potato industry people have criticized the pact claiming 
it will give canadian producers an unfair advantage because they 
receive price and transportation subsidies from the government 
growers in the northeast are generally opposed because of competing 
imports of canadian round white potatoes but western growers are 
mostly in favor of the agreement since they export russet potatoes 
to canada 
the report said south korea is an example of a fastgrowing 
economy which could support greater imports of us potato products 
if trade restrictions were eased 
the tantalizing taste of increased export potential has been 
offered by the example of japan which bought 83 percent of us 
french fry exports in 1987 the report said that represented 
more than 70 percent of total 1987 frozen vegetable exports to 
japan 
shannon hamm another economist said us per capita use of 
potatoes on the average has been fairly constant since 1970 the 
big change has been in a shift from fresh to processed potato 
products 
but since 1978 she said fresh potato use has stabilized with 
the baked potato appearing on fastfood menus and the increased use 
of microwaves in the home the use of frozen potatoes which was 
less than half of fresh in 1970 nearly is equal to the use of 
fresh potatoes today 
lucier noting the shift toward frozen potatoes said about 80 
percent of those are consumed as french fries 
if the popularity of fast foods continues and a newly 
perfected fresh fry vending machine finds favor continued growth 
in frozen use is likely he said

on the eve of todays first anniversary of the 
october stock market crash federal regulators approved a plan that 
likely would have prevented the 508point plunge or at least kept 
it from happening all in one day 
after markets closed on tuesday the securities and exchange 
commission and the commodity futures trading commission said they 
authorized a oneyear experiment providing for coordinated trading 
halts or circuit breakers during steep market dives 
the plan calls for a onehour trading halt in the event the dow 
jones average of 30 industrial stocks plummets by 250 points or 
more from the previous days closing a drop of 400 points would 
trigger a twohour trading halt 
one year ago today the dow fell a record 508 points wiping out 
an estimated 500 billion in paper wealth in a single day because 
most of the crash occurred in the last hour of trading a circuit 
breaker plan such as the one approved tuesday likely would have 
limited the damage to 400 points 
the new york stock exchange the nations largest stock market 
and the chicago mercantile exchange the largest market for trading 
stockindex futures proposed the experiment on july 7 
other markets including the chicago board options exchange the 
american stock exchange and the national association of securities 
dealers overthecounter system are joining in 
because congress failed to agree on market reforms this year 
circuit breakers are the most substantive change stemming from the 
crash 
government approval is effective immediately it is up to the 
exchanges to decide when to begin 
were ready to implement this as soon as thursday we think 
this is a very significant action to remedy what problems there 
were in the market a year ago said andrew yemma a spokesman for 
the chicago merc 
the plan is designed to provide an orderly halt to trading 
before one market stock or futures breaks down shifting all of 
the trading to the remaining market it is also intended to allow 
time for buyers to step in and counter overwhelming sell orders 
another part of the plan gives individual investors as opposed 
to pension and mutual funds preference in trading on the new york 
stock exchange when the dow moves either up or down by 25 points 
the rule applies to orders of 2099 shares and smaller 
after the crash many individual investors complained that their 
orders were shunted aside in some cases for hours while larger 
buy and sell orders from institutional investors were executed 
the market halt plan is one of the key recommendations offered 
after the crash by a presidential task force headed by nicholas 
brady a new york investment banker who is now treasury secretary 
the nasd said earlier this month that it was going along with 
the plan only reluctantly because it did not want to be the only 
market left open when all others were closed 
but nasd president joseph r hardiman argued that a 
preannounced trigger for market halts could act as a magnet 
pulling the market down faster as the market approaches the halt 
point it could be flooded with orders from traders fearful they 
will be prevented from selling he said 
with the sec approval a previous sixmonth experiment to curb 
computerized index arbitrage ends the earlier program had provided 
that when the market moved by 50 points or more index arbitrage 
orders were not allowed through the nyses automated trading system 
index arbitrage is designed to take advantage of momentary price 
discrepancies between the stocks and futures markets it involves 
the buying and selling of massive blocs of stocks and futures 
contracts and was criticized for making last years crash more 
precipitous 
however the socalled 50point collar experiment ran counter to 
the brady commissions finding that stock and future markets were 
in effect one market and that disconnecting them could be dangerous 
a new rule taking the place of the collar is aimed at providing 
more orderly index arbitrage when the standard and poors 500 index 
falls by more than 12 points the equivalent of 96 points on the 
dow index arbitrage orders will be shunted into a side file of the 
trading computer if buy and sell orders can be matched the trades 
will go through if not trading in individual sampp 500 stocks could 
be halted

laboratory tests show the human body rapidly 
converts a part of the soybean oil used in some ordinary food 
products into the same kinds of fatty acids found in fish oil 
according to an agriculture department scientist 
chemist edward a emken of the departments agricultural 
research service said healthy people on a typical american diet 
may have to look no further than their salad dressing for benefits 
that some people are seeking from fish oil capsules 
two men in a preliminary study consumed the soybean oil 
component linolenic acid and within a few hours their bodies had 
coverted it into the same omega3 fatty acids found in fish and 
marine oil he said 
think of it this way the body can naturally make its own fish 
oil omega3 fatty acids from the linolenic acid in soybean oil 
emken said in a report released tuesday by the usda agency 
emken led the study at the agencys northern regional research 
center peoria ill and was helped in the work by st francis 
medical center peoria 
the report said capsules of fish and marine oils have been 
touted by advertisers and debated by nutrionists as dietary 
supplements whatever the merits it said the capsules have become 
popular with any consumers hoping to ease or prevent conditions 
ranging from heart disease to rheumatoid arthritis 
our study is the first to show that linolenic acid is rapidly 
converted to omega3 fatty acides found in marine oil emken 
said the study also provides direction for further research to 
learn which dietary fatty acids including those in fish and 
soybeans best meet human nutritional needs 
soybean oil is the only major domestic vegetable oil that 
contains much linolenic acid and makes up 79 percent of the 
vegetable fats in the average us diet the report said the fats 
are in such foods as shortening margarine and cooking oil as well 
as in salad dressing

communist east germany has agreed to pay some 
reparations to holocaust victims and their families and is 
considering steps to improve ties with israel according to the 
president of the world jewish congress 
both steps mark a significant departure from east germanys 
previous policy 
world jewish congress president edgar m bronfman speaking at 
the end of a threeday visit to east germany said tuesday a plan 
for east german reparations to holocaust victims had been completed 
bronfman declined to give any details and did not say how much 
would be paid out heinz galinski leader of west germanys jewish 
community said earlier that east germany would pay up to 100 
million to holocaust victims 
in his news conference bronfman referred to an international 
claims conference backed by the wjc that has handled reparations 
issues for holocaust victims 
i understand that the negotiations that took place between the 
east german government and the claims conference have been 
completed bronfman said they will be lived up to and the 
details and communications will be worked out and reported 
i am completely satisifed with the results he said i 
have nothing further to say on the payments question it is not my 
responsibility to discuss the details 
since its founding in 1949 east germany has argued that it 
bears no responsibility for nazi atrocities because the nation was 
born after world war ii it has also stressed that communists had 
also suffered under nazi persecution 
this summer however the government said it would provide 
unspecified humanitarian aid to holocaust victims 
staterun media also have reported in recent months on 
government efforts to improve relations with east germanys tiny 
jewish community there are an estimated 450600 practicing jews in 
east germany 
i am totally satisfied on two counts bronfman said the 
first is the one that concerns me the most that is the moral 
position that east germany is taking on its responsibilities on the 
holocaust the second point is payment to the sufferers and 
survivors 
bronfman 59 also said he hoped for improved contacts between 
east germany and israel the two countries have never had 
diplomatic relations and east germany has been a staunch arab 
supporter 
during his threeday stay in east berlin bronfman held talks 
with east german communist party leader erich honecker foreign 
minister oskar fischer and other officials

one of the nations largest block of voters 
will receive new status and rights if president reagan as 
expected signs into law three major veterans bills headed for 
congressional approval 
one of the bills elevating the veterans administration to 
presidential cabinet status is headed for reagans desk following 
senate passage by voice vote 
the other two also passed tuesday night by the senate on voice 
votes must be returned to the house for final votes but approval 
there is considered assured 
the bills would give veterans for the first time in 170 years 
the right to have courts review va decisions denying benefits and 
would provide a package of costofliving payment increases to 22 
million veterans and 310000 widows and orphans 
a new department of veterans affairs would be the 14th cabinet 
agency and the fifth created in the past 28 years it would replace 
the va the federal governments fifthlargest agency 
the va serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or 
survivors its 30 billion annual budget includes 14 billion 
annual payments for income maintenance and 626 million for 
education and rehabilitation assistance 
the agency and its 240000 employees administer about 90000 
patient beds in 534 health facilities va doctors will see about 20 
million outpatients this year it runs 109 national cemeteries and 
will bury about 300000 veterans in the next 12 months 
the congressional budget office said switching the va to a 
cabinet department will cost 33 million over five years most of 
that will go for changing signs on va buildings 
sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the senate veterans 
affairs committee said the new departments first order of 
business should be to investigate a deficiency in va hospital 
beds 
sick veterans are being turned away from va hospitals across 
the country cranston said because the reagan administration 
misled congress about the vas real needs and the va medical 
system faces a 635 million budget deficit 
the appellate review bill creates a new independent us 
court of veterans appeals to replace the current board of 
veterans appeals that panel is part of the va and is now the last 
resort of veterans who are unhappy with decisions to reject their 
claims 
decisions of the new court could be appealed to the existing 
us court of appeals for the federal circuit on any legal matter 
but not on factual findings 
the measure also eliminates a civil warera law which limits 
attorneys fees for veterans claims to 10 per claim that made it 
difficult for veterans to hire lawyers other than those provided by 
the va 
the bill is a historic advance in veterans rights cranston 
said 
on oct 3 the house approved somewhat similar legislation by a 
4000 tally but minor differences between the two bills mean 
another house vote is required 
before passage the senate added an amendment which could 
provide interim health care payments to some vietnam veterans who 
were exposed to agent orange a highly toxic defoliant used by us 
forces in southeast asia 
the va would assume that two types of cancer nonhodgkins 
lymphoma and softtissue sarcoma were caused by agent orange 
veterans could receive benefits while the us government which 
hasnt finally agreed that agent orange caused cancer studies the 
problem 
sen john kerry dmass a vietnam veteran said agent orange 
provisions will have a very limited effect 
i find it highly disturbing that those people who went to 
fight the vc in vietnam spend too much fighting the va back here in 
this country kerry said 
the senate also added an amendment to permit the va to offer 
vietnamera veterans flight training courses under the auspices the 
gi bill

the ozone layer that protects the 
earth from excessive solar radiation has suffered twice as much 
damage as expected a united nations environmental expert says 
the protective layer in the outer reaches of the earths 
atmosphere is 4 percent thinner than it was in 1986 according to 
dr mostafa tolba the executive director of the united nations 
environment program 
last year scientists predicted this years reduction would only 
be 2 percent tolba told reporters tuesday he is in the hague for 
a twoweek conference on the ozone layer problem 
the suns ultraviolet rays reaching the earths surface 
unfiltered by the ozone layer have been linked to a variety of 
environmental and health problems ranging from stunted plant growth 
to skin cancer in humans 
it is also held partly responsible for the gradual heating of 
the earths atmosphere known as the greenhouse effect 
damage to the ozone layer is mainly caused by a group of 
manmade chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs which are 
widely used in aerosol cans refrigerators air conditioners and 
various types of plastic foam used for packaging and insulation 
the uneporganized gathering of scientists from more than 30 
nations is the first meeting of its kind since last years signing 
of the montreal protocol which calls for the production of cfcs to 
be cut to half its 1986 levels by 1998 
however tolba said chlorofluorocarbons production should 
ultimately be cut to 15 percent of those levels or even phased out 
completely if there is to be no further damage to the ozone layer 
since the late 1970s the ozone layer which forms naturally but 
is gradually depleted by the emissions has contained a large hole 
over the south pole 
tolba said the hole appeared slightly smaller this year than in 
1987 although he added it is normal for its size to fluctuate from 
one year to the next he said climatic factors and not a lessening 
of the cfc problem were responsible 
the netherlands and west germany both major cfcproducing 
nations have already called for a complete ban on production of 
the dangerous chemicals 
under the montreal protocol a review of the ozone layer 
situation is scheduled to begin in 1990 but tolba said that 
process will be accelerated and begin next year 
later this week scientists at the conference will discuss the 
use of harmless substitutes for cfcs the conference ends oct 28

the united states is willing to consider a 
down payment on its ambitious goal of eliminating all farm 
subsidies by the year 2000 a us official says 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said the reagan 
administration would accept an interim agreement calling for 
targets of reducing farm subsidies in 1989 and 1990 
but he insisted that us negotiators would not go along with 
the interim subsidy reductions unless they receive in return a 
strong commitment to pursue the total elimination of farm subsidies 
as part of the current uruguay round of trade talks 
those talks held under the auspices of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade the international body which governs trade 
began in uruguay in 1986 and are scheduled to conclude in 1990 
the 96 nations holding the discussions will meet in montreal 
beginning dec 5 for a midterm negotiating session to review 
progress so far and set goals for the next two years 
i believe strongly that a shortterm down payment in montreal 
would be highly desirable for everyone yeutter said it would 
set an excellent tone for the final two years of the uruguay 
negotiations it would get the reform process underway 
yeutter said the united states is not about to embark on this 
proposition unless we also receive a satisfactory commitment to 
longterm reform 
the 200 billion farm subsidy war has been the most heated topic 
of discussions in the trade round reagan has called for the 
elimination of all subsidies by the end of this century but most 
european countries and japan have called that goal unrealistic 
at this years economic summit in toronto the administration 
was able to get only an agreement for a watereddown proposal to 
work toward reducing subsidies rather than totally eliminating 
them 
yeutter at a briefing for reporters tuesday insisted that 
americas willingness to accept an interim subsidy reduction was 
not a signal that the united states was moderating its position 
he repeated warnings that congress could very likely increase 
farm export subsidies next year just as lawmakers did in 1985 
unless progress is made on the farm issue at the montreal meetings 
he said a proposal advanced recently by australia and various 
other farm exporting nations provided a useful outline for an 
interim agreement 
that proposal which addresses reductions in domestic subsidies 
to farmers export subsidies for farm products and market access 
for other countries is in the ball park of potential shortterm 
reform and with some alterations and editing between now and 
december my guess is that it could constitute the basis for 
shortterm reform yeutter said

the senate sponsor of a procurement fraud bill 
says the legislations severe penalties would give prosecutors a 
powerful new tool to use against defense contractors cheating the 
government 
defense fraud rips off american taxpayers and endangers the 
lives of our fighting forces by providing them with defective 
parts sen howard m metzenbaum dohio said after the senate 
passed the measure by voice vote tuesday 
the bill would allow prosecutors to seek up to 10 million in 
fines for largescale procurement fraud against the us government 
the bill must return to the house which earlier approved a 
similar version 
the defense department estimates procurement fraud cost 
taxpayers 991 million for fiscal years 1986 and 1987 metzenbaum 
said adding this bill gives our government a powerful new 
weapon aimed at punishing and deterring defense fraud 
a person or corporation would be subject to the penalties if 
convicted of a scheme or act to defraud the government in 
connection with a contract of at least 1 million the size of the 
fine would be determined by the severity of the offense 
conviction for each act of fraud could result in maximum 
penalties of 1 million and 10 years in prison there would be an 
overall cap of 10 million for a single defendant 
the senate bill would prohibit contractors from recovering legal 
fees in proceedings where the contractors were found to engage in 
wrongdoing 
this language was not in the house bill and that chamber must 
concur before the bill can go to president reagan 
current law allows contractors to recover significant amounts of 
legal fees from the government as an allowable cost of the contract 
a whistleblower protection provision allows anyone fired or 
punished for furnishing information to the government to sue for 
reinstatement and receive twice the amount of lost pay 
the measure also would authorize 8 million for more us 
attorneys to prosecute fraud cases and increase the statute of 
limitations from the current five years to seven years

a twoday auction of rare books and manuscripts 
from a california seminary including a 175yearold edition of 
pride and prejudice brought 41 million christies auction 
house reported 
the sale from the edward laurence doheny memorial library of st 
johns seminary in camarillo amassed more than twice the presale 
estimate of 19 million christies spokeswoman roberta maneker 
said tuesday 
it was estimated for instance that the jane austen novel 
pride and prejudice printed in london in 1813 would be worth 
from 4000 to 6000 because of worn spines and corners and other 
decay but it brought 49500 
the books and manuscripts had been housed in the seminary since 
the 1940s they were left by the will of the late philanthropist

in a ruling that took the bite out of a 
city ordinance the state supreme court overturned the conviction 
of a man who was fined 50 for allowing his dog to run free 
the high court tuesday unanimously reversed a conviction issued 
by a municipal court in bismarck and upheld by a county court 
saying prosecutors presented no evidence that the pet owner knew of 
the violation 
david sholy of bismarck who acted as his own lawyer before the 
supreme court had been convicted of violating a city ordinance 
that made it unlawful for any owner or keeper of a dog to permit 
the animal to be at large 
the supreme court however ruled that the word permit 
requires some knowledge of the crime or negligence that led to it 
because the city introduced no evidence of culpability at the 
trial the conviction is reversed the court said

italian authorities say they have barred the widow 
of a nazi war criminal from entering italy to promote a book about 
her husbands escape from prison 
annelise kappler had hoped to tour in connection with the book 
that detailed how she helped her husband herbert kappler flee to 
west germany from a rome military prison in 1977 he reportedly had 
been concealed inside a large trunk 
kappler an ss colonel in rome during world war ii was 
sentenced to life in prison for his role in the reprisal slaying of 
335 italian civilians in 1944 seventy of the victims were jews 
kappler died of cancer in west germany a year after his escape 
italian officials including foreign minister giulio andreotti 
a christian democrat and justice minister giuliano vassalli spoke 
out against the visit and the interior ministry announced tuesday 
she would be turned back at the border as an undesirable if she 
tried to enter italy 
mrs kappler said tuesday that she had postponed the trip at 
vassallis request but hoped to come to italy at a future date 
mr vassalli requested in a telegram that i not come out of 
respect for those who suffered under the crimes of the nazis she 
told the associated press in a telephone interview from her home in 
soltau west germany 
publication of her book will be delayed her publisher said 
i believe it opportune to take my distance from the 
intransigent attitude of mrs kappler and put off the book 
presentation until a calmer moment publisher cesare ardini was 
quoted as saying by the italian news agency agi 
the outcry arose as italian jews were holding a convention to 
commemorate the racial laws enacted in 1938 by benito mussolinis 
fascist dictatorship which foreshadowed deportations to nazi death 
camps 
the 200 people attending the convention held in an annex of the 
parliament building broke into applause when a message denouncing 
the visit by kapplers widow was received from nilde iotti the 
communist speaker of the chamber of deputies 
the gesture of mrs kappler who wants to exalt the figure of 
her nazi criminal husband is a challenge to the human conscience 
and the italian people ms iottis message said 
tullia zevi president of the union of italian jewish 
communities which represents the countrys 35000 to 40000 jews 
praised the intervention by italian officials and said mrs kappler 
was trying to make a mockery of italian justice 
mrs zevi said she sees the kappler book an attempt to justify 
her husbands role and the reason she spirited him out of the 
country as part of a trend to rewrite the history of world war ii 
and relegate the suffering of the jews to no more than an accident 
of the war 
she said the convention is aimed at recalling the italian 
legislation so that today any such laws can be be fought no 
matter under what form they are presented

trade deficit in four years as the democratic nominee waged his 
uphill fight for the presidency republican frontrunner george 
bush claimed the underdog label in his battle with the notion that 
the race for the white house is over 
dukakis portrayed the election as a choice between a candidate 
for the wealthy and a nominee who is committed to working class 
americans as he took his case to voters in michigan 
the democratic nominee received an enthusiastic response tuesday 
in kalamazoo when he told the crowd george bush cares about the 
people on easy street i care about the people on main street hes 
on their side im on your side

halt the growing trade deficit and doing nothing to solve the 
problems that led to the 1987 stock market crash which occurred 
one year ago today 
the vice president who traveled to fulton mo site of former 
british prime minister winston churchills famed iron curtain 
speech focused on ussoviet relations in his address at 
westminister college 
but in opening remarks to the students and comments to 
reporters bush sought to convince listeners he doesnt have the 
presidential election in hand 
the worst thing to do would be to show a complacency i dont 
feel or an overconfidence that i do not feel said the gop 
nominee who led by 17 points over in this weeks nbc newswall 
street journal poll 
a dukakis aide however said a new harris poll put the gap at 
about nine percentage points barbara winkour a spokeswoman for 
louis harris amp associates in new york said harris would be 
releasing a poll today but declined to comment tuesday on its 
results 
two other surveys found bush leads of about that size in the 
first poll of 1002 registered voters surveyed saturday through 
monday bush led 4939 percent the second poll of 1201 likely 
voters friday through monday gave the gop ticket a 4940 percent 
lead

communications research in cambridge mass they had margin of 
errors of three percentage points either way

at los angeles 
for his part dukakis lashed out at bush charging that his 
rival has no convictions no ideas no plans 
weve got to end the republican rainbow coalition of red ink 
for our children pink slips for our workers greenmail for sharp 
operators on wall street and golden parachutes for top corporate 
executives dukakis said 
the massachusetts governor said his solution to the trade 
deficit would be to reduce the budget deficit increase foreign 
trade invest in education and training and place a greater 
emphasis on research and development 
while the candidate stepped up the offensive on the campaign 
trail dukakis ad chief said the campaign is releasing a network 
television ad today criticizing bushs plan to make quayle the 
nations drug czar 
if george bush couldnt handle the job how do you think dan 
quayle is gonna do the ad asks

that only the republican nomine is experienced enough to negotiate 
with the soviets told the fulton audience he would remain wary of 
soviet intentions despite the reforms instituted under the 
leadership of mikhail s gorbachev

underdog bush said that his staff will not lighten up were 
going to stay right down to the wire if i find anybody letting 
up in my campaign theyre history

shimon peres labor party which has pledged to 
return some occupied territory in exchange for peace actually 
plans to keep west bank land where the arab population is growing 
fastest a newly released study says 
the usfinanced study by respected israeli researcher meron 
benvenisti also said some 175 million arabs live in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 250000 more than israels latest figure 
of 15 million 
benvenisti a former deputy mayor of jerusalem told a news 
conference that arab living conditions in the territories have 
deteriorated during israels 21year occupation in contrast to 
israeli claims 
he blamed the hardships for spurring the 10monthold 
palestinian uprising during which more than 300 arabs and six 
israelis have died 
if you take indicators like the number of hospital beds per 
1000 palestinians the length of road per capita even the amount 
of water the situation is worse said benvenisti whose study 
the west bank and gaza atlas was financed by the ford and 
rockefeller foundations 
from land expropriation to the pitiful planning to the 
dual system of infrastructure available for arabs versus jewish 
settlers here you can find the reasons for the intefadeh 
benvenisti said using the arabic word for uprising 
benvenisti said the leftleaning labor partys announced plan to 
return parts of the west bank to arab control would keep for israel 
large areas where the palestinian population is growing fastest 
these areas are precisely the areas where the fastest growth 
of both arab and jewish population have occurred he said adding 
that more job opportunities were causing the expansion 
according to labors plan about half of the west bank would be 
kept by israel including the arab cities of ramallah and 
bethlehem the 50milelong jordan valley and all of the 
territorys 118 jewish settlements 
the area labor would return includes the largest arab cities of 
nablus and hebron as well as tulkarem jenin and jericho the 
researcher said 
the rival likud bloc of prime minister yitzhak shamir which 
faces labor in nov 1 parliamentary elections opposes returning 
any occupied territory 
among the evidence benvenisti cited to show a decline in west 
bank living conditions was a drop in the number of hospital beds 
he said there were 215 beds per 1000 arabs in 1970 as compared to 
18 beds per 1000 in 1983 
he also said palestinians have less water than west bank jewish 
settlers as reflected in consumption statistics 
in 1982 he said annual water consumption per capita was 15 
cubic meters for village arabs 35 cubic meters for arabs in towns 
and 90 cubic meters for jewish settlers 
shlomo khayat coauthor of the study noted palestinian anger 
also grows when israels lack of planning leads to such practical 
problems as delays in granting building permits 
this is why you see so many arab buildings going up illegally 
and then being demolished by the israeli authorities he said

mount st helens is approaching a landmark of 
sorts two full years without any new blasts of smoke and ash or 
even burps of lava 
the last eruptive episode occurred oct 2124 1986 when 
the southwest washington volcano added a new lobe to the top of the 
lava dome that sits in its gaping crater 
the dome remains dwarfed by the cavernous crater even though it 
has built to a height of 875 feet above the crater floor 
the volcano first stirred to life in this century in march 1980 
when it began venting steam and ash from its peak its may 18 
1980 eruption leveled 230 square miles of evergreen forest left 
57 people dead or missing and sent up an ash cloud that circled the 
globe 
it also knocked the top 1300 feet off the peak which is now 
8365 feet high 
scientists with the us geological survey cautioned however 
that the quiet period does not necessarily mean the volcano has 
lapsed into longterm inactivity 
mount st helens could erupt again at any time said don 
swanson scientist in charge at the usgs observatory in vancouver 
wash 
throughout its recorded history mount st helens has had active 
periods that lasted for years with relatively short spans of 
inactivity before the 1980s the last eruptive period was from 
1800 to 1857 with intermittent periods of quiet lasting months or 
years according to the usgs western region office in menlo park 
calif 
the volcanos most recent eruptions have been quiet 
domebuilding affairs in which the mountain pumps out thick lava 
to increase the size of the crater dome swanson said however 
that explosive eruptions such as those in the spring and summer of 
1980 remain possible 
the last eruption added about 3 million cubic yards of material 
to the dome which now contains about 101 million cubic yards of 
cooled lava and other volcanic material 
seismic activity also has decreased at the mountain swanson 
said the volcano and surrounding area are continuously monitored 
for earthquake activity by a joint usgsuniversity of washington 
program 
since october 1986 seismic activity has remained at 
background levels scientists said 
sulfur dioxide gas continues to escape from cracks in the lava 
dome but has also remained at inconsequential levels of less than 
50 tons a day swanson said 
by monitoring seismic activity and other signals scientists 
have correctly predicted 16 of the volcanos 17 domebuilding 
episodes

an indian airlines jetliner with 135 
people on board crashed wednesday and exploded in central india and 
130 people died authorities said 
the indian airlines jet slammed to the ground at 740 am 
1010 pm edt tuesday on its final approach to ahmadabad 
airport about 300 miles southwest of new delhi according to capt 
jd rao operations manager of indian airlines in bombay 
the plane made more than one attempt to land said gk rawal 
police inspector at the airport rawal said 130 bodies had been 
recovered and that five survivors had been taken to hospitals 
airline officials said there are several foreigners aboard the 
plane but they did not know their nationalities 
authorities did not know immediately what caused the crash of 
the boeing 737 flying to ahmadabad from bombay with 129 
passengers including five children and a crew of six 
however rawal said the plane was attempting to land in heavy 
fog airport workers were searching for the planes black box 
he said 
there were conflicting reports about the crash 
an ahamadabad airport controller said the jet had started its 
final approach when it crashed near an industrial area and 
exploded he said no one on the ground was hurt 
rawal said the plane exploded in the air 
news reports said the aircraft suddenly fell from the sky hit a 
tree and then a highvoltage power line and exploded the wreckage 
and bodies were scattered in a field near an industrial area 
reports said 
airline officials said the companys managing director gerry 
pais and the federal minister of civil aviation shiv raj patil 
had gone to the crash site 
ahmadabad is about 220 miles from the pakistan border in gujarat 
state 
the aircraft acquired in 1971 is one of the oldest in the 
airlines fleet 
indian airlines the domestic carrier has come fire recently 
for its poor management and maintenance record and frequent delays 
wednesdays crash was the 16th by an indian airlines carrier in the 
past 25 years 
any loss is bad all crashes are the worst and most 
unfortunate said ak vashist an indian airlines spokesman in 
new delhi the companys headquarters 
on june 19 an indian airlines plane crashed at new delhi 
airport but everyone on board survived an investigation showed 
the pilot forgot to lower the planes landing gear 
on jan 1 1978 213 people were killed when an air india jet en 
route to the middle east kingdom of dubai crashed less than two 
minutes after taking off from bombay 
in seattle tom cole of boeing commercial airplanes said an 
investigator for the manufacturer was en route to the crash scene 
from bombay 
boeing 737s have come under increasingly scrutiny since an aloha 
airlines aircraft broke apart in april while in flight and made a 
miraculous landing with a 20foot section missing from the top of 
the fuselage 
this week national transportation and safety board officials 
revealed that a footlong crack and 29 smaller ones were found on a 
continental airlines 737 as it was stripped for repainting on oct 
5 
ntsb chairman james kolstad called it chilling discovering 
the aloha plane was no 152 off the boeing assembly line and the 
continental was no 170 
the federal aviation administration issued an order in may that 
all older boeing 737s those with at least 30000 cycles undergo a 
special visual inspection for cracking 
the indian airlines plane was the 271st off the assembly line 
and company records indicate it was delivered in december 1970 
cole said 
in a telephone interview from his home he said it was 
impossible to determine immediately whether any trouble had been 
reported earlier about the plane because those records were 
available only at company offices 
cole said initial reports received by boeing indicated the plane 
was 1700 feet above the ground 10 miles from the ahmadabad airport 
but added that he was skeptical because thats much too low 
it could even by a typographical error 
the pilot might have been trying to duck beneath the fog or 
could have descended to that level and then climbed higher again 
before the final landing approach but thats all just 
speculation cole said

two car bombs apparently set 
off by leftist guerrillas exploded in an affluent neighborhood of 
this capital rescue workers said six people were injured 
although there was no claim of responsibility the bombings 
tuesday night appeared to mark an escalation in the employment of 
the carbomb tactic by urban commandos 
the previous three car bombs this year were primarily incendiary 
devices the farabundo marti national liberation front claimed 
responsibility for those bombings a nineyear civil war pits the 
marxistled guerrillas against forces of the usbacked centrist 
government 
the latest bombs were powerful blowing one vehicle to bits and 
throwing parts of another onto a 20foothigh roof the bombs 
exploded about two minutes apart 
one went off in the parking lot of the biggest fastfood 
hamburger chain which is salvadoranowned but imitates american 
restaurants it shattered windows and destroyed part of the roof 
the other exploded 200 yards away in front of a complex of 
boutiques and stores catering primarily to the wealthy in the 
escalon neighborhood on san salvadors western edge 
the rebels clandestine radio indicated in an oct 7 broadcast 
that urban commandos would increase activity in such areas 
there is no more tranquil rearguard for the exploiters the 
broadcast said because it is not fair that bombs and explosions 
are heard only in the countryside in the hamlets of the poor 
it is not fair that only the oppressed hear the noise of the war 
and suffer its consequences 
the rich are in this war too 
rescue worker miguel angel torres said five employees were 
injured by flying glass at the biggest another rescue worker 
said one person was slightly injured by flying glass at the other 
bombing site 
torres said two of the injured might lose their eyesight 
nicolas salume owner of the biggest said about 40 people 
were inside the building when the bomb went off he estimated 
damage at 100000 
a man outside the biggest said this is a great injustice it 
is terrorism he declined to be named saying he was an 
industrialist and could become a guerrilla target if publicly 
identified

the chief prosecution witness at the 
divorcefixing conspiracy trial of former miss america bess myerson 
admitted deceiving a grand jury and deliberately taping her own 
mother a codefendant for prosecutors 
the fifth day of testimony by sukhreet gabel in us district 
court on tuesday was marked by stormy exchanges between ms gabel 
and miss myersons lawyer during crossexamination 
the lawyer frederick p hafetz continued to chip away at the 
credibility of the 39yearold witness in the trial of her mother 
former state supreme court justice hortense gabel miss myerson and 
miss myersons lover carl andy capasso 
mrs gabel presided over the divorce trial of capasso the 
former justice 75 miss myerson 64 and capasso 43 are charged 
with a scheme to cut capassos support payments to his estranged 
wife nancy in exchange prosecutors claim ms gabel was given a 
19000ayear city job by miss myerson who was then the citys 
cultural affairs commissioner 
on tuesday hafetz asked ms gabel whether discrepancies in her 
grand jury testimony meant she had committed perjury she shot 
back i would request a copy of blacks law dictionary before i 
am required to answer that question 
the reply of the highly educated witness prompted chuckles from 
spectators and even the judge who defined perjury for her 
later hafetz his voice rising stated you taped your own 
mother purposefully he added did you record your own mother 
with a recorder supplied by courtesy of the us government in june 
of 1987 yes or no maam yes or no 
i recorded a conversation with my mother she said balking 
at a yes or no answer 
judge john f keenan asked the question again 
yes she replied 
that wasnt hard was it ms gabel asked hafetz prompting 
a smile from the witness and the comment it wasnt painless 
under questioning by prosecutors last week ms gabel testified 
that when she learned her mother was presiding over capassos 
divorce she confronted her father over the telephone and was told 
let your mother handle this she knows all about it 
but under questioning by hafetz ms gabel conceded she did not 
mention the conversation in three appearances before the grand jury 
and several depositions to prosecutors 
i knew i wasnt telling the truth i was fully cognizant of 
it she said 
you deliberately and consciously and intentionally omitted 
information when you testified before the grand jury isnt that 
correct asked hafetz 
entirely correct the witness replied 
hafetz is trying to prove that ms gabel is an unreliable 
witness and yet is intelligent and capable enough to have deserved 
the city job on her own merits otherwise it might appear miss 
myerson gave her the post to curry favor with her mother 
on monday ms gabel admitted to being treated for clinical 
depression and did not disagree when hafetz suggested that 
electroshock treatments she had received made your memory 
selective like a swiss cheese with holes in it 
after tuesdays session ended mrs gabel came up to the witness

soviet and american officials watched the 
destruction of the first us cruise missile under the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty and looked to future arms 
control pacts 
the inf treaty is one of the most critical steps in the 
direction of ending the cold war army major gen vladimir 
medvedev head of the soviet onsite inspection agency said 
through an interpreter tuesday what we saw today was a critical 
step in that direction 
i think its very important for our people to feel more 
secure and i think such acts will make us much closer medvedev 
said after us military personnel used handheld power saws and an 
arc torch to slice up the first missile and its protective canister 
us officials hoped to finish destroying 41 cruise missiles and 
41 canisters as well as seven mobile launchers within a few days 
at davismonthan air force base 
onsite inspections will result in more contacts between the 
two countries militaries more knowledge and hopefully more 
understanding said medvedevs us counterpart brig gen 
roland lajoie and this in turn should generate more confidence 
and predictability in our relations 
lajoie said there has been far less tension than expected in the 
115 us inspections of soviet sites spelled out in the missile 
treaty and 31 inspections of us sites by soviets he said there 
has been a lot of flexibility and an amazing amount of good will 
on both sides 
medvedev and 10 other soviet inspectors watched tuesday as 
workers made two fulllength cuts in the first 23foot aluminum 
canister with power saws then sliced the first missile the same 
way with saws and a torch the missile and the canister split in 
half as they were raised by a forklift 
the workers and inspectors then turned their attention to a 
56foot 78000pound mobile launcher 
the missile a 21foot weapon built in 1986 by mcdonnelldouglas 
astronautics co was flight tested at the armys dugway proving 
ground in utah and deployed at an air force station in sicily 
before being shipped to davismonthan in february 
nuclear warheads have been removed from each of the weapons 
slated for destruction then turned over to the energy department 
said capt kendell pease a spokesman for the defense departments 
onsite inspection agency 
fuel and guidance equipment have also been removed from each 
weapon before dismantling pease added 
during their stay the soviets are being escorted by 22 
officials from the inspection agency and davismonthan 
within the first three years of the 13year treaty 443 cruise 
missiles most of which were deployed in great britain and europe 
are slated for destruction 
the treaty signed last december by president reagan and soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev also calls for elimination of 169 
shorterrange pershing ia and 234 pershing ii missiles deployed in 
west germany 
the pact requires elimination of all landbased nuclear missiles 
with ranges of 300 to 3000 miles cruise missiles which cruises 
close to the ground and can be launched from planes the ground or 
submarines have a range of about 1500 miles 
officials said 58 pershing missile stages were eliminated 
between sept 8 and friday at the longhorn army ammunition plant in 
karnack texas each pershing has two stages 
the army destroyed its first pershing launcher in west germany 
earlier tuesday lajoie said 
as of friday the soviet union had eliminated 277 missiles under 
the treaty which calls for the destruction of 1846 missiles in 
all 
the inf treaty is the first to allow onsite inspection and is 
seen as a trial for the proposed stategic arms reduction treaty 
that pact would slash arsenals of longrange superpower nuclear 
weapons by 30 to 50 percent and require more complex procedures for 
verification

hunched over a workbench in a tiny 
shack biologist geoff carroll meticulously records the 
surrealistic sounds of whales surfacing and breathing less than 100 
yards away 
hooked to the portable tape deck next to him is a hydrophone 
submerged in a pool surrounded by ice with astonishing clarity 
come the sounds of splashes the whales whooshing exhalations and 
occasional grinding static when the barnaclecovered skin of one of 
the whales grates against the hydrophone 
with public and media attention focused on the plight of three 
california gray whales stranded in unusually early ice in the 
beaufort sea carroll and his colleagues at the north slope borough 
are trying to take advantage of an almost unprecedented scientific 
opportunity 
seldom do you get the chance to study whales in the wild under 
such ideal conditions says carroll as he logs the times the 
whales surface and their rates of respiration 
the closeup and relatively longterm study of the whales is 
being made possible by their failure to leave their summer feeding 
grounds promptly for nearly two weeks the whales have been 
alternating between two small breathing holes about 75 yards apart 
the whales one of them more than 30 feet long havent been 
inclined to use their bulk to break through the ice when they were 
first trapped it was only a few inches thick now it is more than 
one foot 
they could do it if they just would carroll said of their 
icebreaking potential 
larger bowhead whales which arrive in the icechoked arctic 
ocean earlier and leave later regularly break through several feet 
of ice to breath 
outside a few fingers of northern lights streak the 
starstudded sky a bonechilling wind persists against the 
foaminsulated plywood walls of the sled shed which was 
dragged into position by a snowmobile 
the primitive structure is warmed by a small space heater to 
keep the equipment from freezing 
a shotgun loaded with slugs hangs on a nearby hook before 
stepping outside the biologists scan the vicinity with a 
flashlight looking for the telltale green eyes of a polar bear 
the great white bears regularly hunt open water like this to nab 
unwary seals or sticken whales 
in the darkness the sudden surfacing of a whale is startling 
its warm moist breath palpable to anyone standing along the edge 
of the ice 
in the shed the splashes and breath sounds are interrupted by 
occasional moans and grunts vocalizations the biologists call 
them 
sometimes theyll make a noise like a drum roll like someone 
beating on a bongo drum or a steel drum he said tapping his 
fingers on the workbench to illustrate 
but carroll is surprised at how quiet the gray whales are 
compared to the more loquacious bowheads 
it is sort of fortunate that bowheads vocalize as much as they 
do or we could never count them acoustically if they were as 
quiet as these guys it acoustical counting would be of no use at 
all 
the bowheads are what the borough biologists are most familiar 
with and interested in the bowheads up to 60 feet long are the 
staple of the traditional subsistence diet of the eskimos 
when international pressure threatened to end all whaling the 
borough and the alaska eskimo whaling commission began intensive 
census studies to demonstrate there was an adequate bowhead 
population to sustain limited subsistence whaling 
but the biologists are more than willing to study the smaller 
gray whales an endangered species 
its interesting its a freak occurrence says biologist 
craig george im not sure how much its going to add to gray 
whale biology and im not sure how much its going to help us down 
the road but were interested all the same

a 15minute piece of music apparently 
reconstructed from fragments beethoven wrote for a tenth symphony 
that he never finished received mixed reviews today from critics 
the piece was the result of five years work by barry cooper a 
researcher at aberdeen university in scotland played by britains 
royal liverpool philharmonic orchestra and conducted by walter 
weller it had its public premiere tuesday night at a concert at 
londons royal festival hall 
edward greenfield writing in the london newspaper the guardian 
wrote though even dr cooper would never assert that it was what 
beethoven would finally have delivered i marvel that the long 
andante sections which framed this unexpectedly structured movement 
are so genuinely beethovenian 
paul griffiths of the times of london wrote proper judgment 
of how dr barry cooper has interpreted beethovens presumed 
sketches for a presumed tenth symphony will have to await 
publication of the score his statement that about twothirds of 
it is based directly on beethovens sketches begs an awful lot of 
questions especially when we are concerned with a composer of such 
notoriously untidy working habits 
anthony payne wrote in another london paper the independent 
the audience was only mildly enthusiastic in truth the music 
sounded halfformed 
payne added there has always been speculation about sketches 
for a tenth symphony until the mid1980s however no scholar had 
been prepared to identify much material from the 8000 or so pages 
of sketches which beethoven left at his death in 1827 as possibly 
relating to the mythical tenth 
violinist sir yehudi menuhin who conducted the second half of 
the concert after the piece was played said i think it is a 
valuable work it is certainly beethoven i have huge admiration 
and respect for dr cooper who has done an extremely good job 
cooper told reporters the years researching the musical mystery 
uncovered sketches that struck me as being particularly good 
even by beethovens standards 
he said beethovens plans to finish the symphony were mentioned 
in a letter written eight days before his death he actually 
offered it to the royal philharmonic society of britain cooper 
said and now theyve got it or as much as there is of it 
cooper added i think the overall result has got enough really 
good beethoven in it to make it very well worth hearing

a convicted murderer who escaped from 
prison in 1974 while on weekend furlough and was arrested 14 years 
later as a popular southern california businessman and parttime 
actor has been returned to massachusetts 
arthur bembury 37 was back in state prison in walpole on 
tuesday expressing surprise at his luck in avoiding detection 
during his years on the run 
bembury was sentenced to life in prison in june 1971 after being 
convicted of seconddegree murder in the death of his girlfriends 
mother police said he shot the woman after she told him he could 
no longer see his 14yearold girlfriend 
bembury said he fled on his fifth weekend furlough in 1974 on a 
bus to washington dc 
i remember when i saw the state police outside one day i said 
i am not going to come back if i can help it he recalled i 
was trying to get away from the system it wasnt safe they didnt 
have control of the system and a life could be bought for two 
packs of cigarettes 
he was regarded as a model citizen during his second life in 
southern california where he was known as doug henare a 
successful real estate broker in marina del rey a fashionable los 
angeles suburb and a parttime actor who had a bit part in the 
recent movie colors 
friends said bembury was a tireless volunteer who helped 
troubled youngsters 
i had decided in my mind that i was no longer arthur bembury 
i was douglas henare bembury said you have to become another 
person if youre going to stay out there 
he escaped detection despite being fingerprinted several times 
including an arrest on rape charges which were dismissed 
over the years bembury moved into the administration of the 
american youth foundation a treatment center for abused and 
neglected children opened another group home earned a college 
degree and pursued his career 
he was not arrested until a tipster led los angeles police a few 
months ago to the santa monica real estate office where bembury 
worked 
despite thinking that his secret would be revealed bembury 
didnt tell anyone including the woman he lived with for more than 
a decade and the three children he had with her 
but it was for their own benefit if they knew they might 
have been charged with harboring a fugitive he said yet he 
added that he was emotionally torn 
when you value what you have so much you want to keep it 
bembury said you want to be legitimate totally legitimate 
several times really more than that i thought of turning myself 
in 
gov michael dukakis the democratic candidate for president who 
was not governor at the time of bemburys escape signed the 
extradition order sept 6 it was approved by california gov 
george deukmejian 15 days later he was released to massachusetts 
authorities last week 
bemburys attorney vivian gray said she will consider filing 
papers challenging the legality of the extradition warrant

for 21 years the ballot boxes here were 
controlled by mayor richard j daley now the city is selling them 
for 75 each 
traffic lights street signs and even parking meters are being 
sold along with the wooden boxes that held the votes which kept 
late mayor and his democratic machine in office 
theyre all prized wares at the city of chicago store a place 
where a buyer can tote home a manhole cover and turn it into a 
coffee table 
we started talking about this during the citys 
sesquicentennial last year said lorraine nadis who proposed the 
idea to the chicago tourism council and the citys department of 
cultural affairs 
other cities have stores she said theres the san 
francisco bridge store new york has a store and st louis has one 
too 
here well try to have something from every city department 
and every museum around we have art from all over its not common 
to find any of this stuff 
ms nadis was talking and tending the counter at the same time 
the cityowned store across the street from the bismarck hotel and 
half a block from city hall had been open for a week but afternoon 
business was undeniably slow tuesday 
no takers yet for 100 manhole covers crusted with genuine 
chicago grime 
ballot boxes gouged from years of being bounced from ward to 
ward or tucked in a precinct captains truck have a small plastic 
window to imagine the paper ballots once inside 
an end table if someone wants to put glass on top of it ms 
nadis suggested or as a collectors item theres not too many 
of these left 
they all want to know if there are any ballots inside she 
added ive only opened one people are absolutely enthralled 
with them 
the store also features banners that have waved from city light 
posts to honor a symphony conductor a presidential yacht music 
festivals and visits by foreign leaders 
book shelves hold chicagos very own such as nelson algrens 
chicago city on the make a book of lovehate prose for his 
hometown and analytical works on how harold washington the citys 
first black mayor busted the democratic machine and rose to power 
there are pictures and pins mugs and mens ties even city 
rodents get their due a city sanitation poster titled public 
enemy has a rat crossed with a red line 
unfortunately ms nadis said the store wont be able to get 
every piece of city history 
we wanted to get the aldermens old chairs she said 
referring to recent renovations in the city council but of 
course the aldermen get first shot at things like that

anniversary of black monday which led the tokyo market to 
plunge 383648 points when it opened the next day 
meanwhile japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa referring 
to the anniversary noted tuesday that the crash made japan realize

emperor hirohitos condition worsened today as he 
coughed up blood for the first time since his health suddenly 
declined exactly one month ago 
the emperors daughter atsuko ikeda said hirohito was awake 
but hardly responded to her when she visited him today news 
reports said 
mrs ikeda told reporters her father coughed repeatedly during 
the fiveminute visit to his bedside in the imperial palace kyodo

imperial household agency officials said the 87yearold emperor 
was resting and his condition had stabiized 
the officials said hirohito coughed up a small amount of blood 
around midnight tuesday and later discharged more blood from his 
bowels in response doctors gave him a 042pint blood

in the past month he has received 202 pints in transfusions 
more than twice the normal amount circulating in his body 
imperial officials have declined to confirm or deny news reports 
that hirohito has cancer in the area of his upper intestine 
court physicians have unsuccessfully tried to combat hirohitos 
anemia and hemorrhaging with blood transfusions in recent days

the prosecution rested in the 17monthold 
molestation trial of two preschool staff members but a defense bid 
to compel the testimony of a boy whose allegations initiated the 
investigation in 1984 was stalemated 
at one point tuesday superior court judge william pounders had 
threatened to have the 7yearold boys father arrested but 
relented after conferring with him privately 
the judge gave him until next tuesday to decide whether he will 
voluntarily bring his son to pounders chambers 
the judge who has been told the child doesnt want to testify 
said he must hear the refusal from the boy before he rules on the 
matter 
since the boys allegations were raised against mcmartin 
preschool staff members five years ago his mother has died of 
alcoholrelated liver disease and brother has died of brain cancer 
attorneys said the father told the judge any discussion of the 
case brings back memories of the deaths of the boys mother and 
brother 
the conflict over the testimony arose on the day prosecutors 
rested their case against raymond buckey 30 and his mother peggy 
mcmartin buckey 61 who are on trial on 65 molestation and 
conspiracy charges 
prosecutors have based their case on the testimony of 11 child 
witnesses who told the jury they were subjected to sexual abuse 
while attending the manhattan beach school which was shut down in 
1984 
defense lawyers were scheduled to begin presenting testimony 
today but declined to disclose their first witness 
defense attorney danny davis told reporters he wanted the boy to 
testify because the reports weve gotten is that in june 1984 
the child reported he was being continuously molested by someone 
who was not raymond buckey and raymond buckey had been continually 
in jail for three months at that time 
prosecutors declined to comment on that statement but said if 
the child were capable of testifying they would have called him as 
a witness

dissenting members of afghanistans 
dominant sovietstyle party were arrested prior to a meeting of 
the partys leadership an official source said today 
other afghan sources said the central committee of the peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan began its session this morning 
although no official announcement was made 
the session follows reports of disagreements among party leaders 
as the afghan government seeks to reach a settlement with moslem 
guerrillas who have been fighting afghan and soviet forces for 
nearly a decade 
president najib the partys general secretary and senior 
government officials have spoken repeatedly of broadening the base 
of the government in hopes of ending the war 
the arrests of an undisclosed number of party members was 
announced tuesday night on government television the broadcast 
provided no further details 
the official source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the arrests were due to some opposition activity that they were 
launching against the policy of national reconciliation 
national reconciliation is the term given to efforts to 
negotiate an end to the war with the guerrillas 
these efforts have accelerated with the withdrawal of soviet 
troops scheduled to be completed feb 15 but the guerrillas who 
are supported by pakistan and the united states have refused to 
negotiate with any government headed by najib 
the official source said he did not know whether those arrested 
belonged to the 140member central committee he said most of the 
arrests were made in kabul where committee members have converged 
the past week and were thought to be meeting in separate groups 
before joining for a full meeting 
he said he did not know the number of arrests but deduced 
from the way it was announced that it was more than three 
najib has already made several shows of broadening his 
government but these efforts have failed to bring the mujahedeen 
to negotiations 
najib in may named a new prime minister mohammad hasan sharq 
who is not a party member but has had close ties with the kremlin 
although the party is officially portrayed as unified it has 
two wings the more hawkish khalq and parcham that have had a 
history of periodically violent rivalry since the partys founding 
in 1965 
najib belongs to the parcham faction and took power in 1986 
the party first achieved power in 1978 when noor mohammad taraki 
ousted the government of mohammad daoud who had overthrown king 
zahir shah in 1973 
taraki was ousted by another coup in 1979 and replaced by 
hafizullah amin who was deposed three months later when the 
soviets entered afghanistan amin was succeeded by babrak karmal 
who was moved aside by najib 
under an accord signed april 14 in geneva the soviet union 
began withdrawing troops may 15 an estimated 50000 to 60000 
remain

a black congregation whose 125yearold 
church was destroyed by arson in april has been hit by a suspicious 
blaze that left only a wall standing two weeks before the 
dedication of the reconstructed building 
you try not to get discouraged said wesley matlock whose 
greatgrandparents founded the new bethel african methodist 
episcopal church of rock fork we want to have a church but this 
hurts a lot 
the cause of the early morning blaze has not been determined 
but lt dennis fischer chief of detectives for the madison county 
sheriffs department said it was being investigated as arson 
we have invitations to the church reopening sitting in boxes 
and we were waiting to put them in the mail said donna jackson 
wife of the pastor the rev steven jackson 
we even had hats made for the construction workers saying i 
helped rebuild rock fork its so sad she said nobody really 
knows what to do were just in such a state of shock 
the small church whose 25 members are black has been sitting 
on an isolated site in this southern illinois community since 1863 
but in recent years it has been the target of a bombing and 
vandalism last year it was defaced with racial epithets 
the neighborhood around the church is predominantly white but 
church members say they know of no organized group causing the 
damage they said they have not received any threats 
each time church members joined with volunteers from nearby 
alton and godfrey north of st louis to clean up the damage this 
time they arent sure what to do 
we dont know right now said the pastor 
residents reported the blaze early tuesday and the church was 
pretty well engulfed in flames by the time firefighters from 
nearby godfrey arrived fischer said no injuries were reported 
the fire left only one wall of the church standing just two 
weeks before it was scheduled to reopen after the april 16 fire 
that authorities also said was the work of arsonists the repair 
work had been nearly complete and the congregation was to 
rededicate the church nov 6 
instead they gathered tuesday to inspect more damage jackson 
estimated the damage at about 50000 he said the building was 
insured 
no arrests have been made in either fire 
i just think its a few sick vandals young adults matlock 
said 
virginia debruce another church member said weve been here 
for years and all of this just started lately i guess its just 
the world changing

the boeing 737 has been a success as the worlds 
most popular commercial aircraft but the workhorse jetliner has 
had its share of tragedy since its introduction 20 years ago 
the latest disaster involving a 737 occurred in india this 
morning when an indian airlines 737 crashed on final approach to 
ahmadabad airport about 300 miles southwest of new delhi killing 
130 of the 135 people aboard officials said 
the plane was trying to land in heavy fog but the cause of the 
crash was not known said gk rawal police inspector at the 
airport 
a boeing commercial airplanes investigator headed to the crash 
scene from bombay company spokesman tom cole said here 
on monday national transportation and safety board officials 
revealed that a footlong crack had been discovered on a 
continental airlines 737 as it was stripped for repainting oct 5 
the aircraft came under increased scrutiny after april 28 when 
part of the fuselage of an aloha airlines 737 peeled off at 24000 
feet over hawaii a flight attendant was swept to her death and 61 
passengers were hurt but the pilot managed to land the plane 
safely 
that accident triggered inspections of older 737s and increased 
pressure to update us commercial jets 
a little more than a month ago on sept 16 a 737 crashed and 
burst into flames after running into a flock of birds in northwest 
ethiopia thirtyone people were killed 
on aug 31 1987 a thai airways 737 fell into the sea off the 
southern island of phuket killing all 83 people aboard 
one of the bestknown air disasters involving the aircraft 
occurred in january 1982 when an air florida 737 crashed into a 
bridge after taking off from national airport in washington dc 
killing 78 people 
in august 1981 a far eastern air transport 737 exploded 22000 
feet over taiwan killing all 110 people aboard 
the 737 entered service in 1968 and is the worlds most popular 
commercial aircraft with more than 2000 ordered in five different 
models 
the indian airlines plane was the 271st off the boeing assembly 
line and company records indicate it was delivered in december 
1970 cole said 
the plane in the aloha accident was no 152 the far eastern air 
transport was no 151 and the continental plane was no 170 all 
three were built in 1969 
indian airlines the domestic carrier has come under criticism 
recently for its poor management and maintenance record and 
frequent delays todays crash was the 16th by an indian airlines 
carrier during the past 25 years 
an indian airlines 737 carrying 123 passengers crashlanded on 
its belly june 19 after its landing gear failed and an engine 
caught fire as it slid along the runway but no one was injured

president corazon aquino today 
dismissed criticism of the new us bases agreement and the largest 
political party in congress pledged to support the controversial 
accord 
the agreement signed monday in washington by secretary of state 
george shultz and philippine foreign secretary raul manglapus 
allows the united states to maintain six bases here until 1991 in 
return for 962 million in aid over the final two years of the pact 
but critics charged that the government settled for too little 
compensation filipino negotiators had demanded 12 billion 
annually 
i knew that it would not get total acceptance mrs aquino 
said of the agreement but i still believe secretary manglapus 
did a very commendable job and that certainly it is a big 
improvement from the previous bases agreement 
about 150 members of the leftist may first movement shouted 
antiamerican slogans and burned a us flag near the us embassy 
today to protest the agreement riot police prevented them from 
marching to the embassy grounds and they dispersed without violence 
opposition sen juan ponce enrile said the agreement showed that 
mrs aquino had secretly decided to work for extending the bases 
even after their lease expires in september 1991 
the terms contained in the justconcluded agreement strongly 
indicate to us that the aquino regime will continue to foist upon 
our people this onerous burden of a military presence on philippine 
soil he said 
the united states had been paying 180 million a year for use of 
clark air base subic bay naval base and four smaller installations 
despite the increase there has been strong criticism of the 
agreement because the government raised public expectations that it 
would hold out for 12 billion a year as well as other concessions 
that manglapus failed to win 
the proaquino struggle of the democratic filipino party 
said today that the agreement provided nearly three times as much 
aid as the united states granted to nowousted president ferdinand 
marcos 
our party is satisfied with the agreement and will support it 
although we realize that more hard work is needed to resolve other 
issues related to the american base facilities in our country it 
said 
the party claims membership of 145 of the 202 house members and 
six of the 23 senators 
on tuesday the senate debated whether mondays agreement 
required its approval in accordance with a constitutional provision 
on international agreements but was unable to resolve the issue 
and postponed discussion to a later date 
mrs aquino said today she would discuss the ratification issue 
with lawmakers but my legal advisers tell me that there is no 
need for that 
critics said the accord could prompt even stronger opposition to 
the bases and raise doubts over whether the philippines would 
extend the lease on the facilities which expires in september 1991 
under the constitution any extension must be approved by 
twothirds of the senate where antibases sentiment is strong 
the agreement allows the united states to maintain its policy of 
neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons on 
aircraft and ships visiting the bases 
the constitution mandates that the philippines adopt a policy of 
freedom from nuclear weapons consistent with the national 
interest legal experts say the phrase falls short of an outright 
ban 
communist guerrillas whose demand for the removal of the bases 
has fanned a 20yearold rebellion accused the goverment of 
shamelessly selling out philippine sovereignty

undercover in an alleged crack den were killed within hours of 
each other in separate shootings in upper manhattan authorities

alleged gunmen in what police commissioner benjamin ward said was 
the first case he knew of two police officers being killed in one 
night in different incidents 
undercover officer christopher hoban 26 of brooklyn was shot 
early tuesday night during a drug raid when one of three cocaine 
dealers guessed that he and his partner were policemen ward said 
one of the alleged dealers was also killed 
less than three hours later officer michael j buczek 24 of 
suffern was killed when he and his partner responded to a routine 
medical emergency call in harlem and ended up chasing two 
suspicious men ward said 
the deaths raise to seven the number of officers killed on duty 
this year 
after each of tuesdays killings ward and mayor edward i koch 
met with the officers families then relayed the grim facts of 
each case at hospital news conferences 
its an enormous tragedy its really overwhelming koch 
said 
hoban a fouryear veteran was shot twice as he and his 
partner officer michael jermyn 25 prepared to buy a gram of 
cocaine prior to a raid at what residents said was a crack den one 
of three drug dealers believed the undercover policemen were 
officers and one dealer began firing a 357caliber magnum 
striking hoban in the chest and head the commissioner said 
a dealer manuel delarosa 23 of puerto rico was killed by the 
officers during the struggle the second suspect flavio prophete 
49 was caught fleeing the building and the third suspect was being

to leave a building and noticed two men acting suspicious in 
the lobby said sgt raymond odonnell a police spokesman 
the officers asked them to stop ward said but they fled the 
officers pursued them less than a block before each officer caught 
up with one suspect ward said

two blasts to the chest and abdomen from a semiautomatic weapon 
ward said 
the second man apparently escaped in the commotion as the 
surviving officer fired four shots

shot a cop with the help of descriptions from residents who 
heard the comment police apprehended the man almost immediately

foulmouthed students will be punished for 
unsavory utterances or offending epithets scrawled on lockers under 
a policy designed to stifle an outbreak of schoolyard namecalling 
the measure proposed by board member jackie goldberg requires 
schools to develop discipline plans for those who utter slurs 
against any person on the basis of race religion sex sexual 
orientation disabilities immigration status or political belief 
a companion measure also approved unanimously monday by the 
board of education requires each school to decide how to discipline 
students for acts of physical violence that stem from hatred or 
bigotry 
ms goldberg said she hopes the measures will help reverse a 
noticeable increase in the use of slurs on playgrounds and locker 
graffiti she attributed the increase to a lapse in sensitivity 
since the 1960s

communist party chief stipe suvar 
proposed today that onethird of the partys powerful central 
committee be replaced over the next six weeks the state news 
agency tanjug reported 
he also asked for a secret vote of confidence in members of the 
ruling party politburo by the central committee 
four politburo members whose resignations had already been 
announced were relieved of their seats on that body today they are 
two former party heads bosko krunic and milanko renovica kolj 
siroka an ethnic albanian leader from kosovo and franc setinc a 
communist leader from liberal northern slovenia 
suvar made the proposals after two days of bitter debate among 
the nations leaders at a special conference called to deal with 
the nations worst economic and ethnic crisis since world war ii 
the central committee shakeup would be the largest single sweep 
through the ruling elite since 1948 when stalinists were purged 
after josip broz tito broke with moscow 
no purge is involved suvar stressed accordig to tanjug 
he said the replacements should be carried out by secret ballot 
with several candidates for each seat 
he said a list of candidates would be prepared over the next 
month and voting would then start the central committee should 
have 165 members but currently has 162 because of the death of one 
member and the resignation of two others 
suvar also named azem vlasi an influential ethnic albanian 
leader from the autonomous province of kosovo and svetislav 
dolasevic a slav from the same province as central committee 
members whose continued membership would have to be decided he did 
not say when 
vlasis ouster has been demanded by hundreds of thousands of 
serbs rallying in recent weeks to press for more serbian control 
over kosovo an ancient serbian heartland now dominated by an 
ethnic albanian majority 
ten members of the 23man presidium or ruling party politburo 
including suvar face the vote of confidence by the central 
committee 
we are doing this out of responsibility to the central 
committee the party membership and the broader public suvar 
said 
the vote does not include the four presidium members whose 
resignations were accepted 
nine members of the presidium who hold their seats as party 
chiefs of yugoslavias six republics two autonomous provinces and 
the armed forces are exempt from the confidence vote 
they include slobodan milosevic the party leader of 
yugoslavias largest republic of serbia 
the call for the massive personnel change and the vote came amid 
signs of dissatisfaction with the pace of the meeting 
a state newspaper said today that 200000 serbs may abandon a 
troubled province en masse this week unless progress was made at 
the meeting 
early editions of the official yugoslav daily borba said many of 
the 200000 serbs in the kosovo province were dissatisfied with the 
fruitless and marathon discussions at the partys central 
committee session and were planning a rally for thursday 
during the rally to be held in a suburb of the provincial 
capital of pristina kosovo serbs are to decide whether to leave 
the area and head to serbia a republic to the north borba said 
serbian activists want serbia to have more control over kosovo 
and vojvodina two autonomous provinces which are part of it but 
not fully subject to its control 
serbs allege harassment by the ethnic albanian majority in 
kosovo 
yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces serbia is the largest republic 
the decentralized system of government and collective federal 
presidency were devised in former president josip broz titos 1974 
constitution to prevent one republic from gaining sway but has 
resulted in an ineffective government by compromise 
the ethnic clashes in kosovo have led to broader more 
widespread public protests over yugoslavias teetering economy 
nonserb leaders fear milosevic is using the rallies and his 
campaign for more serbian control over vojvodina and kosovo to 
increase his own power and that of the serbs yugoslavias largest 
ethnic group 
his drive has brought him into open conflict with suvar and with 
milan kucan the head of the communist party in the liberal 
northern republic of slovenia the three are yugoslavias most 
important leaders 
meanwhile a judge in titograd the capital of the southern 
republic of montenegro sentenced a 23yearold man to 60 days in 
jail for denouncing state leaders at an antigovernment protest 
the official tanjug news agency reported tuesday 
the man identified as vukman cejovic was shown on national 
television at the time declaring that yugoslavia is run by 
fascists

army gen michel aoun head of the 
christian military cabinet in a dual government has denied moslem 
charges that he is blocking a solution to lebanons monthold 
constitutional crisis 
aoun also called during an interview for lebanon to regain its 
sovereignty which he said had been lost to syria syria is ruling 
lebanon in a detailed way that includes daytoday affairs he 
said 
aouns rival acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem 
and outgoing parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite moslem 
charged that aoun is an obstacle to electing a new president 
parliaments failure to elect a head of state or new speaker is 
threatening to split the country into sectarian states after 13 
years of civil war 
i am not an obstacle i am a shield that prevents the 
appointment of a president a president for lebanon should be 
elected not appointed aoun said tuesday in baabda northeast of 
beirut 
the 52yearold commander who in 1966 attended an advanced 
artillery course at fort sill okla said his military cabinet 
will continue to rule until a new president is elected 
we shall preserve lebanons unity he said 
former president amin gemayel shortly before his sixyear term 
expired on sept 22 appointed aoun to head a sixman interim 
military cabinet to rule pending election of a new head of state 
aouns appointment was immediately rejected by moslem and 
leftist parliamentarians representing syrianpoliced provinces 
they pledged allegiance to hoss the head of government during 
gemayels term 
the appointment also violated an unwritten national covenant 
dating to lebanons independence from france in 1943 that gave the 
premiership to the sunnis the presidency to the maronite 
christians and the post of house speaker to the shiites 
the 76man parliament has failed three times since aug 18 to 
elect a president due to a boycott by 27 christian deputies that 
prevented the singlechamber house from mustering the 51member 
quorum to convene 
the christians say they boycotted parliament to block the 
election of a prosyrian president who would make lebanon a 
satellite for its neighbor 
parliament on tuesday also failed to convene and elect a 
successor to speaker husseini 
aoun blamed outside powers for the failure to vote in a new 
president and partitioning his cabinet 
the syrians rule the streets the police stations and the 
governors in the hope of dominating the head of state he said 
we should regain our sovereignty from the syrian brethren 
because they have been directly ruling lebanon there wont be a 
sound relationship between lebanon and syria unless syrian troops 
withdraw from lebanon 
the syrian government of president hafez assad is the principal 
power in lebanon with 40000 troops deployed in about 70 percent of 
the nation 
aoun a maronite catholic said he had no new information on the 
14 foreign hostages being held mainly by proiranian factions in 
lebanon 
i do not have updated information at present because they the 
kidnappers keep moving the hostages he said 
the foreign hostages include nine americans three britons one 
irishman and one italian terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press abducted march 16 1985 is 
the longestheld hostage

columbia sc ap three environmental groups have called on 
energy secretary john herrington to prepare an environmental impact 
statement before restarting any of the troubled savannah river 
plant reactors 
if the department of energy refuses the groups will seek a 
court injunction to stop the three aging reactors from operating 
until the comprehensive study is completed dan reicher an 
attorney for the natural resources defense council said tuesday 
the nrdc greenpeace usa and south carolinas energy research 
foundation planned to deliver a letter to herrington today 
requesting the environmental impact statement 
meanwhile a published report said tuesday that poorly trained 
personnel and inadequate safety procedures were blamed for a leak 
of 375000 gallons of water contaminated by radiation at the 
38yearold plant 
officials with the du pont co which operates the nuclear 
weapons facility for the department of energy also said an 
oversight caused underreporting of the amount of radioactive 
contaminant in the water released into a creek on july 8 the 
augusta ga chronicle and the augusta herald reported 
the amount of radiation spilled into the water was too small to 
pose a health or safety threat officials said 
srps three reactors were reduced to half power last year when 
experts questioned whether the emergency cooling system could 
handle a problem at full power 
since april all three reactors have been shut down entirely for 
maintenance and testing amid additional safety questions one 
reactor was restarted for less than a week in august 
when it was shut down srp was the governments sole producer of 
radioactive tritium and plutonium used in nuclear weapons 
an environmental impact statement is required under federal law 
whenever there is a major federal action significantly affecting 
the quality of the human environment 
reicher said restart of the reactors qualifies as a major 
federal action because revelations about the srp reactors 
raise disturbing questions about the environmental and safety risks 
of their future operation 
department of energy deputy secretary joseph salgado said oct 
10 that a phased restart of srps k reactor is planned in 
december and restart the two other reactors will be restarted by 
the middle of 1989 
herrington said last week that the department will operate 
reactors in a safe and environmentally sensitive manner while 
still meeting the nations defense needs

appointment of a form of guardian attorneys at the time had argued 
over calling in such a guardian but all attorneys involved were 
pleased at hewitts recommendation the fort lauderdale news and 
sunsentinel reported tuesday 
rudnicks ruling expected in the next few days should settle 
the widows lawsuit challenging the administration of the trust 
she and edsel ford ii henry fords son by a previous marriage 
had disagreed over how the money should be invested which attorney 
would be counsel for the trust and whether the trust should pay 
family friend william donaldson 1 million a year to manage the 
money as a third trustee 
specific terms of the settlement agreement have not been 
disclosed but mrs fords attorneys said she withdrew her 
objection to donaldson his payments under the settlement havent 
been disclosed 
mrs ford is entitled to receive a minimum of 15 million a 
year from the trust

organizations founder whose 8yearold daughter died from a 
beating last week social workers said 
a spokeswoman for the oregon childrens services division said 
tuesday that the parents have displayed no lack of confidence 
in eldridge broussard jr the founder of the los angelesbased 
ecclesia athletic foundation 
they trust him implicitly said spokeswoman alice galloway 
broussard and the childrens parents abruptly canceled 
interviews with agency caseworkers tuesday galloway said 
the children who are in the agencys custody have yet to visit 
with their parents each family has been assigned a caseworker who 
will determine whether each child can safely return home 
galloway said the children were recovering quickly from what 
authorities allege was a terrifying experience at the hands of the 
religious group 
the clackamas county juvenile department has charged that the 
children routinely were beaten with a paddle or electrical cord 
some children were beaten up to 800 times while others were forced 
to keep count the department said in a court petition 
the children had scars consistent with extended beatings and 
they were mentally scarred as well authorities said 
when they first arrived at state institutions and foster homes 
saturday the children were very quiet but by tuesday they were 
talking and even arguing which galloway called a healthy sign 
the children were eating like horses and the staff is watching 
what theyre eating so they dont get sick said galloway 
the 53 children were taken into state custody after the beating 
death of dayna lorea broussard on friday four men associated with 
broussard have been charged with manslaughter and are in custody 
two other children are in the custody of los angeles police 
departments childrens protective division said capt patrick

three antiapartheid leaders 
who escaped to the us consulate 36 days ago emerged from their 
refuge today to test the governments claim that they are free men 
the activists said nelson mandela serving a life prison term 
for his antiapartheid activities advised them to leave the 
consulate they pledged to resume antiapartheid work 
the government says it will not detain the men again they had 
been jailed without charge more a year when they slipped away from 
police guards and fled to the consulate sept 13 
the three murphy morobe and mohanned valli moosa leaders of 
the united democratic front coalition and vusi khanyile chairman 
of the national education crisis committee had been living in a 
consular meeting room on the 11th floor of a johannesburg office 
building 
the men grinned broadly as they embraced their families and 
colleagues waiting in the lobby of the building they gave 
clenchedfist salutes to cheering supporters mostly young blacks 
who chanted viva and amandla which means power in 
zulu language 
riot police with truncheons and shotguns were deployed officers 
sought to keep the crowd under control and police camera crews 
filmed the event 
its great to be out of here said khanyile 
it is not without apprehension that we have left the 
consulate valli moosa said at a news conference later 
notwithstanding the governments assurances we realize that we 
could be redetained or given harsh banning orders 
valli moosa said the three were influenced by advice from 
mandela a black leader who is recuperating from tuberculosis at a 
cape town clinic 
the view of comrade nelson mandela was that we should leave 
the consulate as soon as possible and that assisted us in our 
decision to leave valli moosa said he said the advice was 
passed to the three by mandelas wife winnie 
the united democratic front is the countrys largest 
antiapartheid coalition the crisis committee a front affiliate 
was formed to seek greater black control over education policies 
both groups were banned in february along with scores of other 
organizations opposed to apartheid 
morobe 32 and valli moosa 31 were detained in july 1987 
after going into hiding when a state of emergency was declared june 
12 1986 khanyile 37 was detained in december 1986 
the activists said they had cordial relations with the us 
consulate staff but were never offered a meeting with us 
ambassador edward perkins 
we would like to interpret it as a snub but there may have 
been other reasons said morobe he said the three did not 
request a meeting with perkins the first black us ambassador in 
south africa 
us officials said they would not force the three to leave 
despite a us policy of not allowing diplomatic offices to be used 
by those seeking asylum 
about 30000 people have been detained without trial for varying 
lengths of time under the 28monthold state of emergency about 
1000 people currently are believed to be in detention most are 
being held for political activism 
an activist who escaped sept 21 to the us consulate clifford 
ngcobo left the refuge earlier to obtain medical treatment his 
lawyers had alleged he was tortured while in custody 
between the emergency declaration and his detention morobe 
operated from underground as chief spokesman for the united 
democratic front one of the fronts most eloquent speakers and 
writers he played a key role in coveying its positions at a time 
when most of its leadership was in jail or in hiding 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
it was unclear whether the government will allow the three 
activists to promote their positions freely or whether they will be 
restricted in some manner

johann deisenhofer robert huber and 
hartmut michel of west germany won the nobel prize in chemistry 
today for determining the structure of certain proteins needed in 
photosynthesis 
in 1982 michel was able to obtain these proteins in a 
crystalline form that allowed their structure to be determined and 
the structure was then determined in collaboration with deisenhofer 
and huber said the citation from the royal swedish academy of 
sciences 
deisenhofer 45 studied at the max planck institute for 
biochemistry and now works at the howard hughes medical institute 
in dallas 
huber 51 is still at the max planck biochemistry institute in 
martinsried west germany michel 42 works at the max planck 
institute for biophysics in frankfurt 
the proteins studied by the researchers were taken from bacteria 
which like green plants draw energy from sunlight these 
socalled membranebound proteins are found in the membranes 
surrounding structures called chloroplasts and mitochondria inside 
cells chloroplasts contain chlorophyll which is essential to 
photosynthesis and mitochondria are the cells energygenerating 
factories 
the work of deisenhofer huber and michel has led to increased 
understanding of photosynthesis not only in bacteria but in algae 
and higher plants as well the academy said

three americans won the nobel prize in 
physics today for discovering a way to use beams of ghostlike 
subatomic particles called neutrinos to peer ever deeper into the 
fundamental structure of matter 
three west germans won the nobel prize in chemistry for 
determining the structure of proteins that plants and some bacteria 
need to convert sunlight to energy through photosynthesis 
the royal academy of sciences awarded the physics prize to leon 
lederman melvin schwartz and jack steinberger for their work with 
neutrino beams 
the announcement said their work was carried out in the 1960s 
and opened entirely new opportunities for research into the 
innermost structure and dynamics of matter 
the academy also cited their discovery of the muon neutrino 
neutrinos are extremely tiny particles even on the subatomic 
scale with no electrical charge they interact very weakly with 
other forms of matter and could easily pass through a layer of lead 
trillions of miles thick without being diverted from their course 
according to the nobel citation 
the contribution now awarded consisted among other things of 
transforming the ghostly neutrino into an active tool of 
research the announcement said 
lederman who got the call from stockholm around 6 am edt 
said 
its a nice way to be awakened they apologized for waking 
me up but i said thats quite all right anytime 
asked about the scientists research he added this is an 
experiment that was completed and published in 1961 those poor 
guys in stockholm have been puzzling over it ever since and finally 
decided it was good stuff 
some day some kid who is now in high school will find out how 
to use this information to bring benefits to all of society 
lederman 66 said he hasnt decided whether to use his share of 
the 390000 prize to buy a castle in spain or a string of race 
horses 
lederman is director at the fermi national accelerator 
laboratory in batavia ill schwartz 55 is a former professor at 
stanford university and now president of digital pathways inc in 
mountain view calif 
steinberger 67 was born in bad kissingen west germany and is 
an american citizen however the academy officially lists his 
nationality as swiss he has been a physicist at cern in geneva 
since 1968 
the academy cited the laureates research at columbia university 
in the early 1960s when they tried to find a way to study the 
effect of weak forces at high energies 
during a coffee break lederman schwartz and steinberger with 
other scientists discussed using beams of common particles 
electrons protons and neutrons but those beams were judged 
unsatisfactory for the purpose 
schwartz then proposed using a beam of neutrinos for the 
experiment it took two years to devise an intense beam of 
neutrinos free from all other particles and to design a detector to 
measure reactions produced by the neutrino beam the announcement 
said 
chemistry prizewinners johann deisenhofer robert huber and 
hartmut michel of west germany were cited for the determination 
of the threedimensional structure of a photosynthetic reaction 
center 
in 1982 michel was able to obtain the proteins in a crystalline 
form that allowed their structure to be determined he then 
determined their structure in collaboration with deisenhofer and 
huber 
deisenhofer 45 studied at the max planck institute for 
biochemistry and now works at the howard hughes medical institute 
in dallas 
huber 51 is still at the max planck biochemistry institute in 
martinsried west germany michel 42 works at the max planck 
institute for biophysics in frankfurt 
the proteins they studied were taken from bacteria which like 
green plants draw energy from sunlight these socalled 
membranebound proteins are found in the membranes surrounding 
structures called chloroplasts and mitochondria inside cells 
chloroplasts contain chlorophyll which is essential to 
photosynthesis and mitochondria are the cells energygenerating 
factories 
the work of deisenhofer huber and michel led to increased 
understanding of photosynthesis not only in bacteria but in algae 
and higher plants as well the academy said 
todays prizes were the last of six for 1988 each prize is 
worth 390000 
on tuesday maurice allais whose ideas on balancing supply and 
demand helped rebuild the french economy after world war ii won 
the nobel prize for economics 
on monday american researchers gertrude b elion and george h 
hitchings shared the medicine award with sir james w black of 
britain for helping develop drugs to treat leukemia high blood 
pressure aids and other diseases 
un peacekeeping forces won the nobel peace prize announced 
sept 29 in oslo norway and the award in literature went last 
week to egyptian novelist naguib mahfouz the first arabiclanguage 
writer to win it 
economics is the only one of the six nobel prizes not stipulated 
in the will of swedish industrialist alfred nobel the inventor of 
dynamite who died in 1896

the justdivorced wife of billionaire 
washington redskins owner jack kent cooke said today she will wage 
a long hard battle to win generous support for her infant 
daughter 
the battle has just begun because i have my daughter to 
protect said suzanne martin cooke 32 
cooke 75 was granted a divorce from his third wife last week 
but child support and a financial disposition of the prenuptial 
agreement signed by both parties are still at issue 
fauquier county va circuit court judge w shore robinson has 
scheduled a hearing dec 12 to rule on matters pertaining to the 
divorce including paternity of the child mrs cooke said she 
asked for blood tests to determine paternity of 9monthold 
jacqueline kent cooke to put to rest the vicious rumors going 
around washington 
cookes lawyer burke mccahill of leesburg va said today i 
cant really offer any comment right now when asked for reaction 
to mrs cookes statements he also would not comment on whether 
cooke had denied paternity of the child or on whether cooke has 
agreed to submit to blood tests 
mrs cooke in a telephone call to the associated press said 
i want to make sure my daughter is taken care of as well as his 
two sons were taken care of as far as education housing no 
amount of money could ever pay for the damage hes done to hurt 
his poor innocent daughter you cant put a figure on it 
there is no financial settlement its going to be a long 
hard battle she said his problem is getting bigger and 
bigger every day 
according to court documents cooke had agreed to marry suzanne 
martin on july 24 1987 on condition that she terminate a 
pregnancy that began in early june 
after the marriage she backed down on the promise and the 
couple separated about four weeks later court papers said cooke 
filed for divorce in october 
jacqueline kent cooke was born on jan 25 1988 six days before 
the redskins won the national football leagues super bowl 
championship 
under terms of a prenuptial agreeement mrs cooke would be 
entitled to 50000 a year for three years after the divorce plus 
use of a watergate apartment for five years and a new jaguar in 
contesting the divorce she sought a 15 million lumpsum 
settlement spousal support of 10000 a month custody of the baby 
and 8000 a month in child support 
cooke is one of the richest men in the country according to the 
current issue of forbes magazine he owns the redskins the 
chrysler building in new york the los angeles daily news a 44 
million horseracing stable in lexington ky and a cable 
television system 
his first wife was awarded a 41 million divorce settlement in 
1979 which made the guinness book of world records as the largest 
such settlement and his second marriage lasted 10 months

wall street greeted the first anniversary of the 
worst stock panic in history today with cynicism wariness and the 
longawaited government approval of circuit breakers designed 
to foil another crash 
it is not just another day many people are aware of it 
said philip c puccio manager of institutional trading at the 
dillon read amp co brokerage 
this whole month as a matter of fact people have been very 
aware of it puccio said people have just chosen to get past 
this period psychologically it has had a major effect on most 
players 
reporters and camera crews crammed the new york stock exchanges 
visitor gallery high atop the cavernous exchange floor on wall 
street this morning as three senior exchange officials clanged the 
opening bell greeted by a chorus of boos and cheers from the 
throngs of floor traders market makers and messengers below 
outside on the corner a vendor was selling bumper stickers 
reading i survived the crash of 87 but i used to drive a 
mercedes 
its business as unusual said arthur d cashin a 
painewebber group inc broker and governor on the floor of the 
nyse where prices inched to a postcrash high tuesday and edged up 
further this morning still the lack of business has left many 
standing around with little to do 
if theres no fire all you see is guys polishing the 
engines cashin said theres a lot of people not 
participating a lot of people on the sidelines i would say the 
mood is sober bordering on the sullen 
the atmosphere in the heart of the nations financial center 
contrasts sharply with the heartstopping stupefying frenzy of a 
year ago when prices tumbled out of control and shattered a 
fiveyear bull market that only a month earlier had shown little 
sign of fading 
the dow jones industrial averaged finished that day with a 
record 508point loss to 173874 a decline of 226 percent more 
than 600 million shares changed hands nearly double the previous 
record 
it was a jolt that shook the financial world and threatened to 
bleed into the nations banking system it raised fears of economic 
recession and at least foretold uncertain times ahead 
since then forecasts of recession have receded while the dow 
average and other key indices have recovered somewhat late 
tuesday a buying burst lifted the dow average 1938 points to 
215985 its highest postcrash close in the first half hour of 
trading today the average went up an additional 160 to 216145 
but many wall street professionals say the stock market remains 
uninspired despite entreaties by some of the bestknown firms 
exhorting investors to buy they blame continuing uncertainty about 
the direction of interest rates and the nations general economic 
health 
i think people on wall street are more concerned about the 
economy said earl ellis a market maker on the nyse floor if 
you could assure people that the economy would be good this market 
would take off 
the nyse alarmed about postcrash investor apathy and 
underlying fear of another crash joined with other us financial 
markets last july in proposing circuit breakers coordinated 
trading halts and price limits to avoid another panic 
late tuesday the eve of the crash anniversary the securities 
and exchange commission approved these proposals which had been 
expected nyse officials said the proposals officially become 
effective as of the close of trading today 
coordination among markets was a key recommendation by a white 
house panel appointed to study the crash but it took months for 
the new york exchange and other markets to finally agree on how to 
do it 
theres a time to be stubborn and theres a time to be 
accommodative and get some stuff done exchange chairman john 
phelan told reporters at a briefing earlier this month when he 
talked about the circuitbreaker proposals i think this last 
year has been a time to be accommodating

a judge permanently barred a mans doctors 
from telling his exwife that he had tested positive for the aids 
virus 
a lawyer for the man identified in court documents only as john 
doe said the ruling tuesday could have nationwide implications 
johnson county district judge marion chipman said in his order 
issuing a permanent injunction that the man would be substantially 
and irreparably injured by the release of his test results to his 
exwife by prime health a kansas city health maintenance 
organization 
court documents said the man does not have aids but has tested 
positive for the virus 
chipmans opinion noted that the man signed an affidavit saying 
he has no intention of engaging in sexual relations with his 
exwife any more and that the woman has tested negative twice for 
aids exposure the second time after her last sexual contact with 
the man two years ago the document did not indicate why the 
unidentified woman had decided to have aids tests previously 
prime health said it provided health care for both the man and 
the woman the company had said the woman should be advised of the 
test results even if she has not had sex with him recently to 
alert her to the potential danger she may face 
frank saunders a lawyer for prime health said after the ruling 
that the health organization would abide by the ruling asked about 
an appeal he said i doubt it theyre divorced now the 
threat isnt there anymore 
david waxse an american civil liberties union lawyer for the 
man said the ruling could be the first nationwide where a person 
has had to get an injunction to prevent his health care provider 
from releasing the information that he has tested positive for aids 
for other court cases with similar issues it could have 
nationwide implications waxse said we think the judges 
legal reasons may have application to a wide range of cases 
chipman ruled the mans right to privacy would be violated if 
prime health were allowed to reveal the results to anyone 
including the mans exwife 
we are very pleased that judge chipman could rationally look 
at the issues and decide it based on legal principles involved and 
not based on the hysteria often accompanying the aids issue 
waxse said

here are excerpts from the citation for 
the nobel prize in physics and background material from the royal 
swedish academy of sciences leon lederman jack steinberger and 
melvin schwartz of the united states won the prize on wednesday for 
their work with neutrino beams 
the work in the 1960s led to discoveries that opened 
entirely new opportunities for research into the innermost 
structure and dynamics of matter two great obstacles to further 
progress in research into weak forces one of natures four basic 
forces were removed by the prizewinning work one of the 
obstacles was that there was previously no method for the 
experimental study of weak forces at high energies the other was 
theoretically more fundamental and was overcome by the three 
researchers discovery that there are at least two kinds of 
neutrino 
one belongs with the electron the other with the muon the muon 
is a relatively heavy charged elementary particle which was 
discovered in cosmic radiation during the 1930s the view now 
accepted of the paired grouping of elementary particles has its 
roots in the prizewinners discovery 
neutrinos are almost ghostlike constituents of matter they can 
pass unaffected through any wall in fact all matter is transparent 
to them 
every human being is penetrated by sun neutrinos at a rate of 
several billion per square centimeter per second day and night 
without leaving any noticeable trace neutrinos are inoffensive 
they have no electrical charge and they travel at the speed of 
light or nearly 
the contribution now awarded consisted among other things of 
transforming the ghostly neutrino into an active tool of research 
as well as in cosmic radiation neutrinos can be produced in a 
multistep process in particle accelerators and this is what the 
prizewinners utilized 
the very first experiment using a beam of highenergy neutrinos 
originated in one of the daily coffee breaks at columbia 
university in this stimulating atmosphere around nobel 
prizewinners td lee cn yang nobel prize for physics 1957 and 
others at the end of the 1950s the need to find a feasible method 
of studying the effect of weak forces at high energies was 
discussed 
hitherto it had only been possible to study processes of 
radioactive decay spontaneous processes at low energies beams 
of all common particles electrons protons and neutrons were 
discussed while these are relatively simple to produce they were 
found to be unusable for this purpose 
the apparently hopeless situation suddenly changed when 
schwartz proposed that it ought to be possible to produce and use a 
beam of neutrinos during the next two years he lederman and 
steinberger worked on the proposal in order to achieve a 
sufficiently intense beam of neutrinos free from all other types of 
particle and to design a detector for measuring neutrino reactions 
to eliminate these unwanted particles completely from the beam 
a 135meterthick wall of steel was needed the material came from 
scrapped warships the measuring device consisted of a large 
number of aluminum plates with spark gaps between them a muon or 
an electron produced by a neutrino in one of the aluminium plates 
photographed its own track as a series of sparks using a special 
selfexposing device 
the prizewinners and their collaborators arranged their detector 
so that the cause of the spark tracks could be interpreted the 
results showed that only muons were produced by the neutrinos in 
the beam no electrons 
thus there exists a new type of neutrino that forms an intimate 
pair with the muon consequently the electron forms its own 
delimited family with its neutrino

what about the 17 points governor 
the bad news question dogged michael dukakis at a time his 
presidential campaign needed a lift 
the 17 points was the lead republican george bush had over 
dukakis in an nbc newswall street journal national poll released 
with barely three weeks left until election day 
whether that lead was real or a statistical aberration its 
potential impact was critical 
if bush was really that far ahead the race was over the vice 
president could start sending out the invitations to his inaugural 
ball and dukakis could start wondering if wanted to run for another 
term as governor of massachusetts 
but what if the poll was wrong would it be quickly forgotten or 
would it foster the impression that another republican presidential 
election victory was inevitable and make it that much harder for 
dukakis to rally his supporters for a closing drive 
dukakis aides rushed to refute the nbc poll by pointing to other 
surveys saying the bush lead was more like seven percentage points 
a gap the democratic nominee had a more realistic chance to 
overcome 
this business of polls is really having a terrible effect 
said dukakis 
he said polling really drives the process 
in this campaign that certainly has been true 
ironically it was the same nbc poll that last july said dukakis 
was 18 points ahead of bush the largest margin ever enjoyed by the 
democrat in the battle of poll numbers 
in the early stages it was all going dukakis way 
every week through the spring and early summer a new survey 
came out saying the democrat was eight or nine or 10 or 15 or 17 
points ahead of bush 
the surveys said up to half of likely voters questioned had a 
negative opinion of the vice president 
bad news for bush he was dead candidates with negatives in the 
40 to 50 percent range dont win elections 
print up the tickets to the dukakis inaugural ball 
if that news werent bad enough what about the gender gap 
there was something about george bush that women didnt like polls 
said the vice president was doing well among white males but 
trailing far behind dukakis among women 
those were the early polls now its three weeks until the 
election and the picture is far different 
gone are the bush negatives the gender gap still exists but 
only in the respect that bush does better among white males than 
among women 
in the nbc poll bush led 64 percent to 30 percent among white 
males among women he led 4844 percent a gap that was within the 
margin of error that still would qualify as a gender gap but 
would hardly offer much consolation to dukakis 
at least dukakis could claim he was consistent in his feelings 
about polls e brushed them off as meaningless when they showed him 
way ahead and did the same when they said he was trailing 
the nbc poll came out late in the day on monday and was the 
latest in a series of blows to the dukakis campaign effort to 
regain momentum 
a recent abc statebystate survey said bush was leading in 
enough states to suggest he could be headed for an electoral 
landslide 
then last weekend the washington post published a story saying 
dukakis aides had formulated a closing strategy leaning heavily on 
18 states with 272 electoral votes only two more than needed to 
win 
campaign aides rushed to deny they were adopting such a narrow 
plan that would leave no margin for a loss in any target state 
in the wake of those two polls and the post story dukakis 
headed into the industrial midwest 
the crowds were good and enthusiastic and the candidates 
rhetoric was sharper than it had been 
out on the stump it was easy to set aside bad news 
if you tried to tell these people you cant win michigan or 
ohio theyd tell you you had rocks in your head said charles 
baker the campaign field director 
maybe it was all a mirage and a massachusetts miracle was going 
to occur on nov 8 
and like dukakis was telling crowds were going to be the 
ones celebrating on election night

the federal aviation administration is 
preparing to order a broader inspection of older boeing 737 
aircraft amid continuing concern about cracking on the aging 
jetliners officials said today 
the broader inspections which have been under review for 
months were being speeded up after a series of cracks along a 
30inch section of a continental airlines boeing 737 including 
one a foot long were found by chance two weeks ago 
it was not clear how many 737s would be subject to the 
inspection order 
the faa ordered about 200 of the aircraft those with 30000 or 
more landing and takeoff cycles to undergo special inspections 
last spring after a 20foot section of an aloha airlines boeing 737 
broke off during flight 
the new order is not related to the crash of an indian airlines 
boeing 737 in thick fog early today as it tried to land in 
ahmadabad india killing 130 people although that plane was an 
older boeing 737 there is no early indication of a structural 
problem before the crash officials said 
according to the air transport association there were 570 
boeing 737s in operation by us airlines at the end of l987 but 
many of those planes are newer models that likely would not be 
subject to the special inspections 
the boeing co said that 212 of the 737s operated by 19 us 
airlines had 30000 or more cycles and were subject to the faa 
order last spring among the airlines that widely use the 737 are 
united airlines continental delta air lines piedmont airlines 
usair and southwest airlines 
faa spokesman bob buckhorn said the new inspection order will 
require broader use of highfrequency electronic equipment to 
better detect cracks and will require the stripping of paint 
buildup so cracks can more easily be detected 
were looking for it the inspection order to be issued by 
friday said buckhorn the faa is expected to give carriers time 
to conduct the surveillance without grounding aircraft officials 
said 
meanwhile two federal agencies are trying to determine why the 
cracks on the continental boeing 737 were not discovered earlier 
continental workers found the cracks including one about a foot 
long on oct 5 after they stripped paint from the plane to prepare 
it for repainting 
the jet like the one involved in the aloha incident last april 
was 19 years old and was among the first 291 boeing 737s that used 
a socalled cold bonding method of attaching sections of metal 
skin to the fuselage 
the faa and the national transportation safety board have asked 
for the maintenance and repair records of the aircraft officials 
said 
faa spokesman john leyden said that the cracks were located 
below a window near the firstclass section where repairs had been 
made while the aircraft was owned by frontier airlines continental 
absorbed frontier in 1986 
the rest of the airplane didnt have any problem with cracks 
and that raises the suspicion that when the repairs were made they 
were not done in accordance with all the procedures that would be 
prescribed in the boeing manual said leyden 
he added however that the faa has yet to review the repair 
records and has not concluded what caused the crack 
the faa and ntsb also are trying to determine the age of the 
crack and if it was present last spring why it was not discovered 
as part of the inspections ordered last may after the aloha 
incident an aloha flight attendant was swept to her death when a 
huge section of the plane broke away at 24000 feet 
continental said that its plane which has more than 55000 
takeoff and landing cycles was inspected may 20 according to the 
faa directive but that no cracks were found

american workers used a 
highspeed saw and cutting torches today to scrap the first us 
intermediaterange nuclear missile launchers deployed at bases in 
western europe 
these wont just be torches and saws cutting heavy steal 
beams these are small steps toward a more peaceful and safe 
world said christopher evans commander of the us army missile 
maintenance center in hausen a suburb of frankfurt where the 
launchers are being destroyed 
evans a civiliam employee of the us army said the first of 
nine launchers were destroyed tuesday and the work was to be 
finished late today the metal was taken to a site near frankfurt 
for use as scrap 
the launchers are being eliminated under the intermediaterange 
nuclear force treaty signed by president reagan and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev last year in washington the 
intermediaterange missiles themselves are to be destroyed in the 
united states 
soviet inspectors and 150 journalists and photographers watched 
as a dozen workers lifted wrenched and cut through the dark green 
metal of the fifth launcher for 1 hours in a large workshed 
the launchers 31 feet long are flatbed truck trailers with 
boom structures that lift a missile from the horizontal position 
and hold it in place for firing 
as workers from martin marietta an american company that built 
the structures wrecked the launcher the acrid smell of hot metal 
filled the air a large electric circular saw used to cut the 
smaller pieces emitted smoke and flying sparks 
the visitors and workers wore protective glasses as welderlike 
cutting torches called plasma arc cutters severed two 
doughnutshaped collars designed to hold the missiles steady 
later the workmen cut in half the beams of the trailers themselves 
the nine launchers had been deployed at a base near stuttgart 
and were hauled away sept 1 along with the missiles 
evans said the remainder of the 99 pershing 2 missiles still 
deployed in west germany will be removed from their bases later 
this year or early next year 
all of the launchers will be destroyed at the hausen site he 
said in addition to the nucleartipped pershing 2 missiles 62 
groundbased nuclear cruise missiles also were stationed in west 
germany

one of the americans who shared a nobel prize in physics said 
today that being a scientist is enjoyable and winning a nobel is 
icing on the cake 
i will recommend it to anybody said leon lederman 66 in a 
telephone interview from his home in batavia ill where he is 
director of the fermi national accelerator laboratory its 
really very pleasant its a nice way to be awakened 
the official calling him with the news from stockholm at 6 am 
cdt apologized for waking me up but i said thats quite all 
right anytime 
lederman shared the prize announced today in stockholm sweden 
with melvin schwartz 55 a former professor at stanford university 
and now president of digital pathways in mountain view calif 
and jack steinberger an american citizen who lives in switzerland 
the three did their prizewinning work together in the early 
1960s at brookhaven national laboratory on new yorks long island 
while they were all associated with columbia university in new york 
city 
schwartz said he also was asleep when he got the news by phone 
at 4 am pdt at his home in san francisco 
obviously im very excited about it he said in a telephone 
interview its been a long time since we did this piece of 
work 
the work was the first pioneering effort to essentially put 
together an experiment in which neutrinos which very rarely 
interact in matter at all interact schwartz said 
lederman said the prize was very very pleasing actually 
doing science is a great deal of pleasure even if you dont win the 
prize but winning it is icing on the cake 
this is an experiment that was completed and published in 
1961 those poor guys in stockholm have been puzzling over it ever 
since and finally decided it was good stuff 
no americans were among the three winners of the nobel prize in 
chemistry also announced today in sweden but one of the three 
west germans getting the honor currently resides in the united 
states johann deisenhofer 45 works at the howard hughes medical 
institute in dallas 
i cant believe it yet deisenhofer said today im still 
in a state of shock as for what plans he had now that he had 
won he said i havent made up my mind yet as you can imagine 
what i plan now is to have breakfast 
the chemists were honored for research into proteins involved in 
photosynthesis 
physics winner lederman got his bachelors at city college of 
new york before getting his masters and doctorate from columbia 
he taught physics at the university for more than two decades 
schwartz received both his bachelors degree and doctorate from 
columbia where he taught physics for eight years before going to 
stanford university in the mid1960s he became president of 
digital pathways in 1983 
lederman said he had no plans yet regarding the prize money and 
joked i havent decided whether to buy a castle in spain or a 
string of race horses 
science is a tremendous career to follow you have fun all the 
time some blood sweat and tears too but it is ultimately 
rewarding 
some day some kid who is now in high school will find out how 
to use this information about the neutrino to bring benefits to 
all of society 
he said it was the first nobel prize for a staff member at 
fermilab where he has been director since 1979 
i hope it might encourage them federal budget makers to send 
us more money and the supercollider he said referring to the 
proposed research facility for which several sites in the country 
are competing 
fermilab already home of one of the worlds most powerful atom 
smashers is operated by a consortium of 54 researchoriented 
universities in the united states and canada under contact with the 
us energy department 
steinberger 67 was born in bad kissingen west germany and is 
an american citizen however the swedish royal academy of sciences

a federal judge today dismissed charges that a 
former cia agent participated in an illegal conspiracy to help arm 
the nicaraguan rebels but gave prosecutors a chance to bring the 
case anew in virginia 
us district judge aubrey e robinson jr granted a motion by 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh to dismiss the fivecount 
indictment against joseph f fernandez 
but the judge denied a request by the defense to prohibit walsh 
from seeking to obtain a new indictment in virginia where several 
of the alleged offenses took place 
the defense contended that walsh had acted improperly by 
bringing charges of criminal activity in the nations capital when 
four of the five alleged offenses took place across the potomac 
river in virginia 
robinsons order dismissing the charges against fernandez 
without prejudice leaves walsh free to try to obtain an indictment 
from a federal grand jury in alexandria va 
walsh said in his request to dismiss the case that he would seek 
to bring a new indictment in virginia 
fernandez 51 was indicted last june on charges that he 
conspired with former national security council aide oliver l 
north and arms dealer richard v secord to set up a clandestine 
armssupply network for the contras in defiance of a congressional 
ban on such aid 
the indictment said the conspiracy took place in washington and 
elsewhere but fernandez was also charged with four counts of lying 
to his superiors at the cia and the presidential commission that 
investigated the irancontra affair according to the indictment 
that robinson dismissed those alleged offenses took place at cia 
headquarters in langley va 
the defense filed a motion to dismiss the four obstruction and 
false statements charges for lack of venue walsh countered by 
asking robinson to dismiss all five charges to give prosecutors a 
chance to bring the whole case in one jurisdiction 
robinson who had sharply questioned prosecutors about their 
tactics at an oct 6 hearing gave no reason for his decision in 
the onesentence order

a car bomb exploded today near a border 
crossing with israel killing at least five israelis and wounding 
11 others in an army convoy security sources said 
the islamic resistance a coalition of shiite moslem factions 
linked to both the palestine liberation organization and iran 
claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was a suicide 
operation 
but the security sources said on condition of anonymity that the 
bombladen vehicle was detonated by remote control while parked 
about 650 feet from the good fence border point about 20 miles 
east of tyre 
united nations sources in south lebanon said an explosion at 
130 pm destroyed four israeli jeeps 
there apparently are some casualties since there are 
ambulances in the area one un source said on condition of 
anonymity it was not known if the victims were soldiers 
the security sources said two israeli helicopter gunships later 
began airlifting casualties from the border village of kfar kela 
other gunships were seen strafing the fields around the scene of 
the blast apparently to protect the rescue mission from possible 
guerrilla attacks 
a witness told reporters in tyre that he saw a civilian van 
driving behind the israeli convoy when the blast occurred that 
suggested a suicide attack rather than a remotecontrolled bomb as 
reported by the security sources 
the islamic resistance said in a statement relesed in beirut 
one of our mujahedeen holy warriors carried out a suicide 
operation against an israeli convoy in kfar kela inflicting heavy 
casualties among israeli soldiers 
the explosion appeared to be the most devastating attack on 
israeli soldiers since a lone palestinian commando flew across the 
lebanese border in a hang glider on nov 26 killed six soldiers 
and was slain 
israel carved out a sixto10milewide security zone along its 
border with lebanon when it withdrew the bulk of its troops from 
lebanon in 1985 after a threeyear occupation the purpose of the 
buffer was to prevent guerrilla infiltrations into israel 
but the estimated 1000 israelis who patrol the enclave along 
with allied militiamen of the estimated 2000strong south lebanon 
army have been regular targets of guerrilla attacks 
israel usually retaliates for attacks against its troops by 
sending warplanes to bomb palestinian and lebanese moslem guerrilla 
bases in south lebanon 
the last antiisraeli attack was aug 19 when a lebanese car 
blew up near an israeli army jeep in the buffer zone slightly 
injuring three israeli soldiers

the food and drug administration today 
announced new drug approval procedures to speed development of 
treatments for lifethreatening diseases like aids 
in essense the new regulation would create a mechanism for the 
fda to work with drug companies in the earliest stages of a drugs 
development to refine preliminary tests in animals and humans to 
get the most useful data in the shortest possible time 
while that clearly could shorten the approval time for drugs 
that subsequently prove to be safe and effective in most cases it 
would require a larger financial commitment from drug developers 
long before they have any realistic assessment of whether the drug 
will eventually pan out and thus enable them to recover their 
research investment 
fda commissioner frank e young acknowledged at a news 
conference that the revised procedures would show results only if 
private pharmaceutical companies take advantage of new 
opportunities to get the fda involved in earlier stages of drug 
development 
the word may is scattered throughout the proposal 
establishing clearly that it creates new options for drug companies 
rather than requirements in the drug approval process 
the regulation is being published in the federal register as an 
interim rule with a 60day public comment period meaning it is 
effective immediately 
young said repeatedly that he did not want to overpromise 
the likelihood of dramatic changes in early development of drugs 
for aids cancer and other lifethreatening diseases 
nonetheless he defended the agency against charges by aids 
activists that the new regulations are politically motivated to 
help the campaign of vice president george bush who has headed 
the reagan administrations effort on easing regulatory red tape at 
the fda and other federal agencies 
young pointed out that bush and massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis agreed at their first debate that they are in essential 
agreement on how to cope with the aids epidemic including support 
for federal antidiscrimination to protect people carrying the aids 
virus 
the fda commissioner used two analogies in explaining his view 
of how the new regulations would work as a college professor 
giving students a clear idea of the answers he was looking for on 
an essay test question rather than leaving for the students to 
guess what was on the professors mind and of the agency being 
more like a baseball catcher helping call the signals 
rather than strictly as an umpire just calling safe and out 
in simplified terms the new procedures encourage drug 
developers to meet with fda regulators when they are getting ready 
to go into phase ii testing after preliminary animal and human 
tests have established the safety of a drug 
the idea is that the fda would help the companies design studies 
specifically greared to answering the scientific questions about a 
drug that the agency considers most pressing 
if that happens and the phase ii tests clearly establish that 
the drug is effective the final step before approval phase iii 
testing on reasonably large numbers of patients could be sharply 
curtailed or perhaps even bypassed 
emphasizing that the new procedures would be used only for drugs 
designed to treat lifethreatening diseases where no effective 
therapy is available young said a treatment could be approved 
even if some questions reamin to be answered by researchers 
there might be questions about the very best way to use a 
drug the lowest dose that was effective for example he said 
such questions could be studied after the drug was approved and 
would not delay its approval

five nuns who have locked 
themselves in their monastery protesting liberalizing changes in 
their way of life are forgetting their vow of obedience says their 
mother superior 
as the dispute has escalated among the carmelite nuns over how 
to live a cloistered life of prayer both sides have turned to the 
media to plead their cases 
mother teresa hewitt prioress of the monastery of the most 
blessed virgin mary of mount carmel called in reporters tuesday 
and in front of bright lights and cameras called the rebellion 
attempted anarchy 
she said she has received hate mail from around the country 
since the five nuns moved into the monasterys infirmary oct 4 and 
demanded their religious order return to a more conservative 
lifestyle 
the five nuns say they are protesting the innovations of 
allowing them some use of radio television candy and newspapers 
but the real issue said mother teresa is their refusal to obey 
her 
i will not give in to attempted anarchy of a total disregard 
for the rules of the order she said what if the governor of 
massachusetts was voted president and all the people who supported 
mr bush rebelled 
the nuns have an obligation because of their vows to respect 
their prioress whether they like the person or dont like the 
person 
mother teresa defended the changes she has made since becoming 
prioress 14 months ago saying the roman catholic church is 
constantly evolving and that the changes were well within the 
constitution of the order 
sister john of the cross one of the barricaded nuns who has 
acted as a spokeswoman said their allegiance to the orders rules 
supersedes allegiance to their superior 
were saying she has deviated from the rules sister john 
said in a telephone interview we vow obedience to the ruling 
constitution and its the reponsibility of the prioress to uphold 
the constitution 
it is up to the vatican to issue a final report and 
recommendations for settling the matter according to the rev 
kevin culligan who tried unsuccesfully to resolve the dispute last 
week

the registerguard eugene ore on protecting whistleblowers 
headed for the presidents desk is a bill imposing major new 
protections for federal workers who expose bureaucratic fraud 
abuse corruption and waste 
information revealed by a whistleblower can certainly embarrass 
an entrenched bureaucracy and the administration but if 
corrective action is taken the embarrassment can be quickly 
replaced with pride in a betterrun agency 
the government will now have to provide clear and convincing 
evidence that whistleblowing was not a factor in a personnel 
decision 
its taken four years of often bitter struggle to forge a 
compromise whistleblower protection bill that both congress and 
the white house could accept 
president reagan should now take the next step and sign this 
important and badly needed legislation

times record brunswick maine on the aclu and the presidential 
campaign 
the american civil liberties union has taken a shellacking at 
the hands of vice president george bush during the presidential 
campgain 
as the aclu is a nonpartisan organization devoted to protecting 
the basic rights set forth in the constitution one could 
reasonably infer that bush also takes a dim view of civil liberties 
thats probably not the case but the fact that bush has gotten 
such mileage out of criticizing gov michael dukakis aclu 
membership suggests many americans have little appreciation of the 
civil liberties they enjoy 
in the waning days of the bushdukakis campaign voters should 
think twice about candidates who cast aspersions on those who 
cherish and defend american civil liberties

how often sitting presidents should face questioning from reporters 
remains 
a new report from the harvard commission on the presidential 
news conference says such meetings dont come often enough and 
the delays hurt both the president and the press 
made up of a panel of journalists and scholars the commission 
said the presidential news conference has fallen into a serious 
state of disarray during the reagan white house 
as a result its report said what should be a steady flow of 
meaningful information becomes a stream that is first dammed up 
then released in a torrent to shouting reporters who are just as 
eager to pounce on a gaffe as on a significant news story 
the commissions recommendation twice monthly conferences 
during the daytime to encourage more substantive and useful 
exchanges and six meetings a year on primetime television 
would be more fair to everyone involved 
the next president should take it seriously

flights 
the recent successful flight of the spaceship discovery is a 
cause for reflection on the united state space program 
the only other country in the world which can even challegne the 
us record in space is the soviet union which undertook 1733 
successful space launches from 1957 through 1985 compared to 844 
for the united states 
only three other nations japan india and china and the 
european space agency together undertook a total of 53 space 
launches during the same period 
so despite a year and a half of reevaluation and retrenching in 
the wake of the challenger disaster the american space program 
remains the pacesetter the team to beat in establishing new 
frontiers in the far reaches of space

a few weeks ago when it became apparent that the socalled 
family issues were generating more talk than action in congress 
sen christopher dodd observed never in the history of american 
politics has there been a constituency so popular but with so 
little political clout as the american family 
the connecticut democrat was proven right a few days ago major 
bills designed to help american families died when the senate could 
not find the votes to end a filibuster by conservative republicans 
the lost legislation dealt with child care unpaid leaves for 
workers having babies or serious family illnesses and tougher 
penalties in child pornography cases 
the package did not offer families all that much but it was too 
much for conservative opponents it would be interesting to know 
what they are willing to offer

in return they would be given a 10000 voucher at the end of 
their tour of duty to be used for education vocational training or 
as a down payment on a first home 
the plans cost in real dollars will be much less than the 15 
billion price tag nunn has placed on it 
by allowing citizens to earn their college education the need 
for many federal loans and grants would disappear the high 
cost of the current allvolunteer military would be reduced 
in an age where brilliance and innovative leadership have given 
way to petty politics and demagoguery nunns plan shines out like

been bashing michael dukakis with the accusation that massachusetts 
releases hardened criminals who use their prison furloughs to 
commit more crimes 
dukakis rather than discuss furlough programs shoots back that 
the federal governments own furlough program releases people who 
commit crimes in the short time they are outside and that bush as 
an administration official has to accept responsibility for those 
failures as well 
a survey conducted by contact center a nonprofit criminal 
justice information clearinghouse found that federal and state 
furlough programs gave some 53000 prisoners more than 200000 
furloughs and encountered relatively few problems 
nearly half of the states reported to the contact center that 
their programs are 98 percent successful six said they were 100 
percent successful 
just one state indiana reported problems so serious they

an ironic commentary on the nuns complaint that a withdrawn 
spiritual life is nearly impossible in todays world 
the nuns who are among the monasterys youngest members oppose 
the prioress decision to impose modern intrusions such as 
television and snack foods on their quest for a quiet 
contemplative life 
they feel such moves will pull them away from the spiritual 
goals they had upon joining the church 
despite their desire for avoidance of todays world much of

the commercial appeal memphis tenn on federal auto mileage 
standards 
building big cars is what detroit does best but federal auto 
mileage standards have threatened to put a crimp in the operation 
in 1975 congress established progressively higher 
milespergallon fleet requirements in order to conserve gasoline 
peaking at 275 miles per gallon by 1985 
the governments action set off a scramble in the industry to 
make smaller cars a race in which american manufacturers with the 
exception of chrysler came out secondbest to foreign companies 
general motors and ford faced deep trouble they werent making 
enough highmileage small autos to keep their overall fleet average 
at 275 mpg so the us transportation department relaxed the 
standard as it was allowed to do under law 
despite demands from some quarters that detroit be required to 
comply with the 275 mpg standard us transportation secretary 
james burnley decided to set it at 265 a slight increase over 
1988 but a figure that gm and ford apparently can live with

quayle said he would pray and then call in the presidents 
advisers that wasnt a good enough answer for tom brokaw et al 
who kept nagging the nominee 
in the interest of fairness the panel should have fired the 
same question at lloyd bentsen 
watching quayle squirm was entertaining but watching his 
opponent explain the policy ramifications of a bentsen presidency 
would have been fascinating 
thats because bentsen differs with his running mate michael 
dukakis on just about everything 
should dukakis become president and some evil befall him we can

instead of focusing on detailed policies and complicated 
positions the national television networks look instead for the 
snappy oneliners that fit neatly into their newscasts 
pity the poor candidates this year and in future years who cant 
condense their positions to five words or less 
it is no doubt easier for candidates to repeat slogans than to 
explain their positions why should they take the difficult course 
when that results only in their being ignored 
candidates have a responsibility to talk about issues the news 
media has a responsibility to ask questions about the issues and 
not allow candidates to so easily take the low road 
both the candidates and the media have taken the easy way out in 
this campaign the american public should demand more the next time 
around

san antonio expressnews on getting qualified federal workers 
the federal government is losing its ability to hire employees 
qualified to perform increasingly complicated and technical work 
because of low salaries declining prestige and needless 
frustration the reagan administration recently told congress 
the result according to a new report prepared for the federal 
office of personnel management or opm is a slowly emerging 
crisis of competence because skilled workers are leaving federal 
service 
obviously the next administration should try to mend fences 
with the federal work force obviously federal employees should be 
granted raises as frequently as members of congress the cabinet 
and other top appointive posts 
contrary to what some politicians think the government is only 
as competent and united as those who work for it not those who 
are elected or appointed to it

vice president george bush today called 
for an end to partisan conflict in us foreign policy even as he 
renewed criticism of his democratic rivals foreign policy views 
campaigning in michigan which campaign manager lee atwater 
labeled one of five key states in the nov 8 election bush 
said the president and congress should extend to each other the 
hand of partnership not the finger of blame 
in a speech at the university of michigan bush said the 
presidents leadership involves the national interest beyond our 
shores an interest important to all americans of whatever 
political persuasion thats why i want to revive bipartisanship i 
want to make it once more the vibrant heart of a foreign policy 
that is decided by a debate which ends at the waters edge 
but he disparaged the qualifications of democratic opponent 
michael dukakis in this field 
lacking experience in foreign affairs he has a rather 
unrealistic view of americans role and the way in which we lead 
bush said of dukakis 
he also said dukakis apparently believes that the soviet 
economic problems have left them too weak to make trouble the 
liberal massachusetts governor seems to think that all we need to 
do is offer moscow economic inducements and a less agressive less 
threatening soviet union will be the result hes wrong 
bush called on dukakis to join me in a bipartisan 
reaffirmation that we are not going to reduce our troops in europe 
unilaterally 
contending that the united states and europe must forge closer 
ties bush promised if elected to propose an early nato summit 
meeting to adopt a strategy for conventional arms control in 
europe to discuss effective deployment of allied forces to agree 
on common diplomacy toward east europe and the soviet union and to 
influence public opinion on the need for the alliance 
atwater said that in addition to michigan the key states are 
illinois california new jersey and ohio 
in addition atwater said there are a range of states like new 
york that are still competitive 
despite bushs growing and substantial lead in opinion polls 
atwater claimed the campaign is not changing its strategy and bush 
will continue to campaign as if he is behind 
in a pair of campus campaign appearances tuesday bush began his 
speeches by telling supporters the race for the white house is not 
over and wont be until nov 8 
the election is still close and there are many undecided 
voters said bush who holds a 17point lead in the latest 
nationwide survey 
the vice president predicted a tough battle for the rest of 
the campaign and told a rally of about 7000 people at southwest 
missouri state university in springfield that he would campaign 
like an underdog 
the worst thing to do would be to show a complacency i dont 
feel or an overconfidence that i do not feel bush insisisted to 
reporters tuesday morning before a speech on foreign affairs at 
westminster college in fulton mo 
bush was making a series of appearances today in michigan where 
he was expected to focus on his defense and foreign policy themes 
of this week former president gerald ford a michigan native was 
joining bush on the campaign trail 
despite the republican candidates repeated cautionary comments 
bush supporters at southwest missouri clearly had victory in their 
sights around the gymansium were banners reading on the road to 
the white house the legend begins the legacy continues 
victory 88 for our man and george is awesome 
the crowd cheered wildly and booed on cue for bushs standard 
dukakisbashing lines 
earlier at westminster college bush did not mention dukakis in 
his speech on ussoviet relations the vice president called for 
a cautionary attitude toward the soviets and a peace through 
strength policy 
bush recalled that the campus was the site of former british 
prime minister winston churchills famous 1946 iron curtain 
speech churchill said a postwar iron curtain of secrecy and 
selfimposed isolation had surrounded the soviet union and the 
communist eastern bloc 
bush said that curtain is rusting today but that in europe and 
other parts of the world we have yet to see the full promise of 
soviet change turn into change itself 
if elected president bush said he would remain wary of soviet 
intentions despite more promising signals from soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs policies 
now is not the time to abandon realism about what moves the 
soviet union he said 
bush asked why he talked about being an underdog when polls 
show him handily ahead said the campaign will not lighten up 
were going to stay right down to the wire if i find anybody 
letting up in my campaign theyre history

an american held hostage in iran settled a 
60 million libel suit with the former owners of the daily news of 
los angeles which had reported he was under investigation for drug 
trafficking 
jerry plotkin one of the americans held for 444 days in the 
us embassy in tehran in 1979 to 1981 did not disclose the terms 
of the settlement but said he received enough to compensate me 
for the substantial damages i have suffered 
my 444 days in captivity were a living hell in many ways the 
almost eight years since my release have been equally torturous 
because of what i considered to be false accusations against me 
he said with this settlement now at last i am truly a free 
man 
the daily news story appeared jan 21 1981 one day after iran 
freed 52 american hostages after one year and 79 days in captivity 
the story quoted unidentified law enforcement sources 
the newspaper then owned by the van nuys publishing co a 
subsidiary of the tribune co in chicago said in the frontpage 
story that police had investigated plotkin before he went to iran 
and reported he was a target of a federal investigation focusing on 
international drug trafficking 
the story gained national attention and was challenged by 
plotkin who was taken hostage when he was visiting the us 
embassy and was the only hostage who was not a us embassy 
employee or military person the day the story appeared federal 
drug agents and the los angeles police department denied any 
investigation of plotkin 
the van nuys publishing co on tuesday released a jointly agreed 
upon statement the company said the story was published with a 
good faith belief in its truth but it said evidence that has 
come to light since the lawsuit was filed establishes that plotkin 
was not under investigation and had gone to iran for completely 
legitimate business purposes 
the daily news now is owned by media and sports entrepreneur 
jack kent cooke and its current management and owners were not 
involved in the plotkin suit

republican dan quayle met behind closed doors 
with jewish backers today conceding republicans have done too 
little to convey their message to the jewish community but vowing 
to step up that effort 
evidently we havent done as good a job as we should have in 
communicating where the republican party stands visavis israel 
where the republican party stands visavis the jewish community 
quayle said as he emerged from the meeting in a chicago hotel 
the early meeting followed a day of barnstorming rural illinois 
quayle toured the state tuesday pledging a vigorous fight to win 
his native midwest from a democratic ticket that he said is out of 
touch with the region and he told displaced workers there that 
unemployment is a consequence of the way our dynamic economy 
operates 
quayle was continuing his tour of smalltown middle america in 
missouri but he started focusing on a jewish vote he considered is 
heavily democratic 
if you look at the numbers theyre not where they should be 
he said were not going to be satisfied until we get a clear 
majority and we dont have that right now 
he dismissed suggestions that members of an ethnic support group 
for bush who were fired for reported antisemitic connections would 
damage the ticket among jewish voters 
he said that incident was handled with dispatch and hasnt 
harmed the ticket 
quayle spoke to students and toured farms tuesday as his bus 
caravan snaked through downstate illinois before arriving in 
chicago the republican vice presidential candidate planned to make 
stops in kansas city and across missouri today 
george bush and i are going to be like tigers between now and 
nov 8 quayle said we have an election to win 
during his tour quayle lashed out at presidential candidate 
michael dukakis as a conceited liberal and contended the 
massachusetts democrat looks down on the region 
they think theyre better than we are quayle told cheering 
college supporters in kankakee we say good night mike because 
he never said good morning to america 
we are the ones who are talking about the future we are the 
ones talking about moving this country forward 
with many parts of the midwest industrial sector suffering from 
decline quayle spent time touting his role in job training 
legislation meeting with displaced workers to give them a pep talk 
if you lost a job its not your fault quayle said its 
not that you didnt work hard 
it happens to be the way our dynamic economy operates that 
power of positive thinking theres no substitute for it 
youve come to the right place this is where you can get some 
help as far as redirection 
aides had scheduled a folksy and photogenic series of 
smalltown stops throughout the day quayle met with hundreds of 
denimclad youngsters on a farm with hay bales and a giant flag in 
the background he also stopped to buy a halloween pumpkin he said 
would be turned into monster dukakis 
as the bus caravan snaked northward quayle occasionally spoke 
through a loudspeaker mounted on top to groups of schoolchildren 
gathered along the roadside 
this campaign is full of controlled spontaneity said 
spokesman david prosperi 
but at the same time quayle and his aides promised an 
aggressive final three weeks of the campaign 
and while quayle continued to warn against overconfidence he 
was upbeat after meeting cheering college students in kankakee 
im beginning to feel what its going to be like on election 
night quayle said 
most polls have shown the republican ticket with a persistent 
lead and some have shown it widening in recent days

sen lloyd bentsen accused republicans 
today of turning the presidential campaign into a mudwrestling 
festival with attacks on democratic nominee michael dukakis that 
have no regard for the truth 
they have forcefed sound bites to the evening news and 
laughed behind the backs of voters demanding some honesty about 
americas future said the democratic vice presidential candidate 
they have viciously slandered the patriotism and record of 
michael dukakis and then turned around and whistled sweetness and 
light when they are called to account bentsen said in a speech 
prepared for delivery at stanford university 
bentsen is seeking to bolster the democrats sagging fortunes in 
the presidential race with a hardhitting assault on what he terms 
the gop tickets campaign of distortion and cynicism 
the texas senator said the attacks by republican nominee george 
bush and running mate dan quayle were reducing the caliber of a 
national campaign to the level of a mudwrestling festival out at 
the cow palace a sports arena near san francisco about 30 miles 
north of palo alto 
they have said things about mike dukakis that in texas we 
wouldnt say about a rattlesnake on a lawn at a church picnic he 
said 
bentsen was winding up two days of campaigning for californias 
47 electoral votes before flying to kentucky 
bentsen had been hinting at some dissatisfication with dukakis 
failure to respond strongly to the republican attacks he uncorked 
his own criticisms on tuesday in a speech at the university of 
california at los angeles and then at a rally in san jose 
they dont seem to mind if its untrue doesnt seem to worry 
them if its misleading cant seem to care if its downright 
mean he said its just the same kind of halfbaked proposals 
they throw up in debate 
if it sounds good say it if it sells package it if it looks 
good nominate it he said 
bentsen and democratic nominee michael dukakis he said have 
been a little incredulous sometimes and havent answered back as 
we should but he said those pointing to the open casket were 
listening to republicans 
well they havent heard the last from mike dukakis and lloyd 
bentsen he said 
this election is too important to sit back and accept the 
cynical view of politics that guides the campaign of the 
opposition he said 
in his ucla address to about 2000 students bentsen traced the 
republican tactics back to july when the democrats held a big lead 
in the polls and the republicans were worried 
and the image makers came in and said dont you worry about 
that wait till we get through with michael dukakis and spend 
millions of dollars on television cutting him up and then well 
turn to a campaign of a sweetness and light and take it on home 
he said 
bentsens campaign was bolstered tuesday by the presence of sen 
sam nunn dga the conservative chairman of the senate armes 
services committee nunn hosted bentsen at ucla and later 
introduced him at a mcdonnell douglas aerospace plant in orange 
county 
nunn said the democratic candidates want to spend more of the 
total defense spending on conventional weapons such as planes and 
tanks while the republicans want to spend more on nuclear missiles 
attempts by the republicans to scare people into thinking the 
democrats would disarm america were gross distortions the 
georgia democrat said 
the democratic ticket has got to hit back nunn said but 
he added that it was dukakis not bentsen who had to head that 
effort

despite strong objections by congressional 
leaders the pentagon is considering a plan to stop the sale of 
tobacco products in military commissaries and to raise the prices 
of cigarettes and alcohol sold in post exchanges 
according to defense sources who asked not to be named deputy 
defense secretary william h taft iv is receptive to the idea and 
has asked his staff to draft a directive that would implement the 
changes on jan 1 
taft would normally be the top pentagon official to deal with 
such matters but several congressmen have now asked defense 
secretary frank c carlucci to intervene calling the proposal 
ill advised and hastily conceived 
this is a very dangerous precedent for commissary and exchange 
operation and it tampers with a very important fringe benefit for 
servicemen rep marvin leath dtexas said in an interview 
it would really penalize the people assigned overseas 
leath the chairman of the house armed services committees 
morale welfare and recreation panel said the two democrats and 
two republicans who serve on that panel with him had joined in 
writing to carlucci last week they include reps bill nichols 
dala nicholas mavroules dmass david ob martin rny and 
jack davis rill 
if carlucci doesnt stop the plan from going forward then we 
are prepared to stop it legislatively leath declared 
the idea of changing tobacco and alcohol sales policies was 
advanced quietly last sept 28 by the defense resources board the 
pentagons highestranking review board for military programs 
maj david super a pentagon spokesman on wednesday 
acknowledged the boards action and agreed the department was 
considering changes but said he knew of no tentative decisions 
having been made by taft 
the drb has made the recommendation to change sales 
policies super said 
this would be another step in an ongoing effort to promote 
good health for service members and dependents smoking cessation 
and deglamorization of alcohol the price increases also could 
generate more morale welfare and recreation funds 
the sources said the plan being considered by taft would remove 
all tobacco products from the commissaries or military grocery 
stores and allow their sale only at the post exchanges which are 
more like drug stores 
cigarettes sold at the exchanges would be priced near regular 
retail rates and liquor prices within the exchange system would 
also be raised to within 5 percent of the local civilian market 
the sources said 
in addition to the congressional opposition taft has received a 
memo from grant s green jr the assistant secretary for force 
management and personnel opposing any change in commissary and 
exchange policy the sources said 
green is also asserting that any sales ban or price hikes would 
be perceived by servicemen as a reduction in benefits 
the defense department through an educational campaign launched 
by former secretary caspar w weinberger has been attempting to 
reduce the use of cigarettes and alcohol among activeduty 
servicemen for more than two years 
that war on smoking was touched off in march 1986 after 
weinberger considered and then rejected a ban on the sale of 
cigarettes or an increase in tobacco prices at military stores 
weinberger shied away from that step because he said he feared 
setting a precedent that would allow the singling out of particular 
products for special pricing 
currently all products sold at commissaries are priced at cost 
plus a 5 percent surcharge in the case of cigarettes that 
produces a roughly 35 percent discount compared to retail prices 
this is a very dangerous precedent for the system as a 
whole leath said echoing weinbergers point 
if they can do it with alcohol and tobacco then whats next 
raise the price of butter because the cholesterol is bad for you

here are excerpts from the citation for 
the nobel prize in chemistry and background material from the royal 
swedish academy of sciences johann deisenhofer robert huber and 
hartmut michel of west germany won the prizeo wednesday for 
determining the structure of proteins that plants and some bacteria 
need to convert sunlight to energy 
they the prizewinners are the first to succeed in unravelling 
the full details of how a membranebound protein is built up 
revealing the structure of the molecule atom by atom the protein 
is taken from a bacterium which like green plants and algae uses 
light energy from the sun to build organic substances all our 
nourishment has its origin in this process which is called 
photosynthesis and which is a condition for all life on earth 
the organic substances serve as nourishment for both plants and 
animals using the oxygen in the air they consume these nutrients 
through what is termed cellular respiration the conversion of 
energy in photosyntheisis and cellular respiration takes place 
through transport of electrons via a series of proteins which are 
bound in special membranes these membranebound proteins are 
difficult to obtain in a crystalline form that makes it possible to 
determine their structure but in 1982 hartmut michel succeeded in 
doing this determination of the structure was then carried out in 
collaboration with johann deisenhofer and robert huber between 1982 
and 1985 
the structural determination rewarded has considerable chemical 
importance far beyond the field of photosynthesis many central 
biological functions in addition to photosynthesis and cell 
respiration are associated with membranebound proteins examples 
are transport of chemical substances between cells hormone action 
and nerve impulses the structure of the reaction center has 
clarified the principles governing the three dimensional structure 
of proteins spanning biological membranes eg ion pumps and other 
transport proteins thanks to the method of crystallization 
developed by hartmut michel the prospects of obtaining detailed 
structural information also for other membrane proteins have 
improved

six comair airline executives accused of 
holding employees against their will in a hotel room to get them to 
undergo drug tests have been charged with misdemeanor criminal 
charges 
boone county attorney larry crigler said tuesday he filed a 
total of 25 charges of unlawful imprisonment against six comair 
manageriallevel officials at the request of five employees 
the unlawful imprisonment charges are seconddegree misdemeanors 
that carry a possible sentence of up to a year in prison and a 500 
fine on each count crigler said 
although the employees were not physically restrained in the 
hotel they were detained against their will by the authority of 
their company superiors crigler said they were told they 
couldnt leave 
the incident allegedly took place sept 15 in a room at the 
radisson hotel at greater cincinnati international airport the 
airport is in kentucky near the border with ohio 
the five employees say airline officials illegally held them and 
coerced them into taking surprise drug tests the employees say the 
tests showed no evidence of drug use 
comair attorney richard creighton said that the company denies 
that there had been any criminal behavior when asked tuesday if 
the employees had been free to leave the hotel room creighton 
replied of course 
also tuesday comair filed a libel lawsuit against the attorney 
for the five crew members garry l edmondson the lawsuit said 
edmondson told reporters at a news conference that comair managers 
shanghaied the pilot and four flight attendants and used 
gestapolike tactics to obtain urine samples 
the lawsuit which seeks unspecified damages contends the 
statements damaged the reputation of comair a regional airline 
based at greater cincinnati international airport the lawsuit was 
filed tuesday in hamilton county ohio common pleas court 
edmondson said he had not seen the lawsuit and declined to 
comment on it except to say sounds desperate to me 
lastl month comair fired five other employees including three 
pilots reportedly because the five either failed drug tests or 
admitted that they used drugs while off duty the three pilots have 
filed grievances against the company

president reagan said today that americans 
will put george bush in the white house because hes running 
against a democratic ticket whose liberal positions only a 
mcgovern could love 
in a speech inside the threetiered ohio state university sports 
arena reagan said the democratic ticket of michael dukakis and 
lloyd bentsen would pursue policies detrimental to economic growth 
and the nations defense 
using the word liberal 15 times in a speech planned for 15 
minutes the president also lashed out at sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio as a big spender and urged his defeat by republican 
challenger george voinovich mayor of cleveland 
when it comes to big spending the national taxpayers union 
has given him their big spenders award reagan said of 
metzenbaum who has vigorously opposed many administration policies 
the arena was festooned with banners with such legends as 
thanks for eight great years and well miss you 
a small section of the bleachers was occupied by students 
holding up dukakisbentsen signs and homemade posters with messages 
such as byebye bonzo and good riddance ronnie 
the speech was interrupted at times with such shouts as i 
would rather be a liberal than be a fascist 
reagan acknowledged the hecklers by saying after enumerating 
the advantages of his administration for young people and that 
even applies to the noisy few that are in here 
from columbus reagan heads to bowling green for another rally 
for the bushquayle ticket and then to cincinnati to address a 
fundraising dinner in voinovichs honor 
reagan returned to the same state with its 23 electoral votes 
where he took an oldfashioned whistlestop tour through towns and 
countryside on the heartland special during his 1984 
reelection campaign 
without naming dukakis reagan likened the democratic 
standardbearer to liberal former sen george mcgovern dsd who 
lost to president nixon by a landslide in 1972 
my friends everything that you and i and george bush have 
worked for these last eight years everything could be lost 
faster than you can say the pledge of allegiance he said the 
liberals talk about reaching for the center but from the economy 
to national defense theyve taken positions only a mcgovern could 
love 
noting last weeks bushdukakis debate reagan said that i 
dont often feel sorry for liberals but i came close 
i couldnt help thinking the problem with those fellows on 
the other side is not camera angles or lighting its not whether 
their candidate is likable or not the president said 
no its the very thing that theyve spent this campaign 
trying desperately to hide theyre out of the mainstream of 
american politics 
robert t bennett chairman of the ohio republican state central 
committee thinks reagan could make a difference in ohio where 
bush and dukakis have been running fairly close 
his reagans approval rating in franklin county columbus 
is 70 percent bennett said in a telephone interview tuesday from 
his columbus office statewide its in the 60 percent range 
bennett said some polls in the state have shown the bush lead 
over dukakis as high as 11 percentage points but i discount 
them 
i think were in good shape right now but i dont think its 
in the bag by any stretch of the imagination bennett said

democrat michael dukakis targeting a rural 
bastion of republican strength in presidential elections said 
today he cares about the future of rural america while republican 
rival george bush has never expressed any particular concern 
en route to a rally at a southern illinois farm dukakis said 
i dont remember any time in this campaign hes expressed any 
concern about family farmers they the republicans like corporate 
operators 
the farm owned by jim and mabel reed was the democratic 
nominees first stop on a bus tour of southern illinois and 
missouri 
dukakis meeting with farmers at the reeds home was being 
broadcast on a hookup to 20 states via satellite cable television 
the states were arkansas colorado georgia illinois iowa 
kansas kentucky minnesota missouri nebraska new mexico north 
carolina north dakota ohio oregon south dakota tennessee 
washington wisconsin and wyoming 
the massachusetts governors aides said he has requested a 
halfhour of air time on each broadcast network the night before 
the nov 8 election 
dukakis said he was making the bus tour to show how much i 
care about family farms and how little george bush cares about 
family farms 
he said bushs philosophy was the fewer farms the better 
dukakis said he also was concerned about the decline of other 
facilities in rural areas particularly hospitals 
he was asked to comment on an interview with willie horton jr 
the massachusetts prisoner who escaped from a furlough in 1986 and 
slashed a maryland man and raped his fiancee last year 
horton now imprisoned in maryland was asked whom hed support 
for president 
obviously im for gov dukakis horton was quoted as saying 
he cant vote commented dukakis 
before arriving at the reed farm dukakis bus went through the 
tiny town of plainville where people stood by the side of the road 
holding up dukakis for president signs 
the candidate opened the bus window leaned out waved and said 
thank you all very much thank you 
the campaign swing through rural areas marked a shift from the 
previous two days when dukakis visited factories schools and a 
bowling alley in ohio and michigan 
george bush was against the minimum wage he was against the 
plant closing law dukakis told workers tuesday at mclouth steel 
products an employeeowned firm on the outskirts of detroit 
the firms motto is the future is in our hands a fact 
dukakis noted when he told the workers thats exactly what the 
election is about 
for two days in urban areas dukakis drew a distinction between 
himself and bush that he summed up this way 
george bush cares about the people on easy street i care 
about the people on main street hes on their side im on your 
side 
he said his gop rival has no convictions no ideas no plans 
the massachusetts governor blamed the republican administration 
for the economic problems of the midwest and for the nations trade 
deficit which he pledged to end within his first four years in 
office 
during the race for the republican presidential nomination bush 
was beaten badly in iowa south dakota and minnesota 
but the man who defeated bush in the those contests was kansas 
sen bob dole whose midwest roots and involvement in agricultural 
policy in the senate made him a formidable candidate in the region 
iowa remains a state in which the democrats have high hopes the 
same is true of minnesota 
the states dukakis was visiting today were key battlegrounds in 
the battle for an electoral majority 
illinois is one of the big prizes with 24 electoral votes 
democrats normally depend on huge majorities from the chicago area 
to overcome republican majorities from the states rural areas 
dukakis hopes to cut into that republican bloc with his pledge 
to create a presidential council on rural development and to target 
100 million to finance projects to help rural businesses 
with 11 electoral votes missouri is one of the largest of the 
border states

house speaker jim wright said today he favors 
passage of legislation this session that would apply the firstever 
lobbying restrictions to former members of congress and 
excongressional staffers 
both houses have approved different versions of the legislation 
which also would strengthen current lobbying restrictions against 
those who leave the executive branch of government 
the senate took the latest action tuesday night with voice vote 
passage of lobbying legislation that modified an earlier senate 
bill 
wright told reporters he has asked house judiciary committee 
members to work with senators to fashion a final compromise and 
approve the legislation before congressional adjournment 
house judiciary committee chairman peter w rodino jr dnj 
and other influential house members have been skeptical about the 
legislation arguing there was no evidence of unethical lobbying by 
exmembers of congress 
but despite such reservations the house passed its own version 
of the bill by a vote of 37419 on oct 12 the house bill was a 
somewhat watereddown version of a bill the senate passed earlier 
this session 
the bill passed tuesday was the senates effort to meet the 
house halfway and house members would have to accept the modified 
version for the bill to go to president reagan 
major provisions of the senate bill would 
bar members of congress from lobbying either chamber of 
congress for one year and restrict highlevel executive branch 
officials from lobbying their branch for one year 
prohibit top congressional staffers from lobbying their own 
member or the members personal staff for one year and prevent 
for the same period top committee staff from lobbying the 
committees members or staff 
provide a oneyear moratorium during which cabinet members 
their principal deputies members of congress and top white house 
aides could not lobby or work for a foreign entity after leaving 
government service 
the legislation would maintain the lifetime ban in current law 
that prevents executive branch employees from lobbying on any issue 
in which they had a personal and substantial involvement while 
in government service 
maximum criminal penalties in the measure include 250000 in 
fines and fouryear prison terms the measure also provides for 
recovery of civil fines of up to 50000 or the amount of proceeds 
obtained by an individual who violates restrictions in the measure 
the legislation would become effective nine months after 
becoming law 
the house bills restrictions on former members of congress and 
their staff would apply only to the chamber where they served the 
senate restriction would apply to contacts in either house 
sen strom thurmond rsc the chief sponsor said the bill 
would prevent those who are employed by the federal government 
from leaving public service and marketing their access and 
influence for financial gain 
in addition the legislation prevents federal employees from 
vending sensitive information vital to national interests to 
foreign entities for profit he said 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio said americans are tired of 
influencepeddling and of congress exempting itself from lobbying 
restrictions

george bush said today the white house and congress should 
extend the hand of partnership on foreign policy as he pointed 
a finger at michael dukakis lack of experience in world affairs 
the democratic nominee wooing rural voters said the republicans 
prefer corporate operators to family farmers 
bush insisted he will fight like were 10 points back 
although public opinion surveys indicate a lead of that margin 
not a deficit the dukakis campaign requested 30 minutes of paid 
time on the television networks for an electioneve plea for 
support 
in dearborn mich the republican nominee said the president 
and congress should extend to each other the hand of partnership 
not the finger of blame he couldnt resist a shot at his rival 
saying dukakis shortage of foreign policy experience has given him 
a rather unrealistic view of americans role and the way in which 
we lead 
dukakis apparently believes that the soviet economic problems 
have left them too weak to make trouble bush said the liberal 
massachusetts governor seems to think that all we need to do is 
offer moscow economic inducements and a less agressive less 
threatening soviet union will be the result 
hes wrong 
dukakis scorned reaganbush administration agricultural policies 
en route to a farm rally in illinois i dont remember any time 
in this campaign hes expressed any concern about family farmers 
they the republicans like corporate operators he said 
dukakis ticketmate lloyd bentsen accused the republicans 
today of lowering the presidential race to the level of a 
mudwrestling contest 
they have viciously slandered the patriotism and record of 
michael dukakis and then turned around and whistled sweetness and 
light he said in palo alto calif 
president reagan continued to depict the democrats as out of 
touch where they want to take america america doesnt want to 
go reagan said in columbus ohio 
the map of todays campaigning looked like a strategy paper on 
key battleground states michigan illinois california and ohio 
hold 114 electoral votes among them a hefty chunk of the 270 
needed for election 
a harris poll released today put the bushdukakis gap nationwide 
at nine percentage points with bush ahead by 53 percent to 44 
percent the survey done friday through monday among 1356 likely 
voters had a margin of error of plus or minus three points a 
harris poll just a week ago indicated a race too close to call 
on tuesday dukakis promised to erase the nations 150 billion 
trade deficit in four years he also portrayed the election as a 
choice between a candidate for the wealthy and a nominee who is 
committed to working class americans 
george bush cares about the people on easy street i care 
about the people on main street hes on their side im on your 
side he said in kalimazoo mich 
dukakis also accused the republican administration of failing to 
halt the growing trade deficit and doing nothing to solve the 
problems that led to the 1987 stock market crash which occurred 
one year ago today 
the vice president who traveled to fulton mo site of former 
british prime minister winston churchills famed iron curtain 
speech focused on ussoviet relations in his address at 
westminister college 
but in opening remarks to the students and comments to 
reporters bush sought to convince listeners he doesnt have the 
presidential election in hand 
the worst thing to do would be to show a complacency i dont 
feel or an overconfidence that i do not feel said the gop 
nominee who led by 17 points over in this weeks nbc newswall 
street journal poll 
bensten who has hinted at dissatisfaction with his running 
mates limited response to gop attacks accused the republican 
ticket of a vicious campaign that violates the public trust 
theyve said things about mike dukakis that in texas we 
wouldnt say about a rattlesnake on a lawn at a church picnic 
bentsen told about 2000 students at the university of california 
at los angeles 
for his part dukakis lashed out at bush charging that his 
rival has no convictions no ideas no plans 
weve got to end the republican rainbow coalition of red ink 
for our children pink slips for our workers greenmail for sharp 
operators on wall street and golden parachutes for top corporate 
executives dukakis said 
the massachusetts governor said his solution to the trade 
deficit would be to reduce the budget deficit increase foreign 
trade invest in education and training and place a greater 
emphasis on research and development 
while the candidate stepped up the offensive on the campaign 
trail dukakis ad chief said the campaign is releasing a network 
television ad today criticizing bushs plan to make quayle the 
nations drug czar 
if george bush couldnt handle the job how do you think dan 
quayle is gonna do the ad asks 
the vice president expanding on his own campaign ad suggesting 
that only the republican nomine is experienced enough to negotiate 
with the soviets told the fulton audience he would remain wary of 
soviet intentions despite the reforms instituted under the 
leadership of mikhail s gorbachev 
now is not the time to abandon realism about what moves the 
soviet union bush said 
questioned about his claim that he will campaign like an 
underdog bush said that his staff will not lighten up were 
going to stay right down to the wire if i find anybody letting 
up in my campaign theyre history 
quayle also was warning against overconfidence but was upbeat 
after greeting cheering college students in illinois 
im beginning to feel what its going to be like on election

drums pounded a trancelike beat 
wednesday night the smell of incense filled the air and temple 
priest gan chai heng cleared his mind of worldly thoughts 
then he and eight other priests led 200 barefoot chinese 
devotees in a calm walk over a 30foot bed of burning coals so hot 
that the 10000 spectators had to watch from 50 feet away 
the firewalking ceremony in front of the temple of the southern 
heaven capped the nineday festival of the nine emperor gods 
temple worker wong choong bun 49 one of those who walked 
unflinchingly over the redhot coals said he felt no pain and it 
was an act of faith in the gods to ensure good luck 
i walk to ensure a good life and for the wellbeing of my 
family and friends wong said 
some carried a statue of the gods with them as they walked over 
the 4footwide and 1footthick bed of coals on wooden platforms 
mounted on horizontal poles others carried images of gods and 
incense sticks in their hands 
we have used several thousand pounds of charcoal for the fire 
and we began making the fire four hours before the firewalking to 
ensure that it was really hot said yap kok chan deputy 
secretary of the temple 
the firewalkers all men wore loosefitting white trousers and 
longsleeved shirts and scarves on their heads we never allow 
women to walk on the fire gan said although they may join in on 
the fasting 
gan who has walked on the coals for more than 10 years said 
its not difficult and added all i have to do is to adhere to a 
vegetarian diet and clear my mind of worldy thoughts 
the firewalkers usually eat one vegetarian meal a day during the 
nineday fasting period although there are some who take only 
liquid nourishment mostly they pray and meditate and must 
abstain from sex 
according to legend a manchu emperor many centuries ago 
beheaded nine gods who helped the people to rebel against his 
oppression the emperor later regretted his actions and prayed 
after an epidemic swept through the region in 1940 residents 
prayed to the statue of the nine emperor gods practiced 
vegetarianism for nine days and started walking on the coals 
now the chinese here especially those who practice taoism come 
for the annual festival walk on the coals and pray and give alms 
to atone for their sins buddhists confucionists and other chinese 
also participate 
western scientists say that firewalkers usually avoid injury by 
walking across the coals with moist feet so that a thin layer of 
steam protects the flesh 
it could be faith and some hypnosis said physician 
ampikaipahan kandiah but there have been some cases reported 
where peoples feet have been burned during firewalking we have 
treated them they put it dwn to lack of proper fasting 
gan said that over the years he has seen a few people with 
slight burns on their feet yap said those with burned feet never 
admit it or show it because they are ashamed that people might 
think they were impure or had not fasted properly no one 
complained wednesday night

scientists from alaska and the soviet frontier 
town of magadan will examine how people adapt to harsh conditions 
in the far north one of the participants said wednesday 
alaska medical students nurses biologists and environmental 
scientists will work with their counterparts in magadan and 
surrounding villages for three weeks next may said dr ted mala 
director of the institute for circumpolar health studies at the 
university of alaskaanchorage 
we plan to bring in sleeping bags and work side by side 
with local physicians assistants and scientists from the institute 
for biological problems of the north in magadan mala said 
the group will examine disease patterns psychological problems 
and medical anthropology including the drug and alcohol abuse 
mala said 
two groups of 10 soviets specialists will travel to alaska for 
similar studies next september and october mala said 
it will be interesting to see what has happened on both sides 
with the difference in diets mala said especially since the 
natives of alaska are related to the indigenous population of the 
soviet union just across the bering strait 
the agreement was signed aug 15 but mala noted that none of 
the group had been anywhere near a telephone since then

military aircraft to scramble radio kabul said nine were killed 
and 18 injured

with airport security said nine people including two soviet women 
and a soviet girl were killed the other people killed were 
afghans he said on condition of anonymity one of the injured was 
a soviet citizen and the rest were afghans he added all 26 
people were waiting in a tent outside the airport 
the rocket was one of 21 that hit the airport grounds between 
925 am and 3 pm the officer said no one was injured by the 
other rockets but some windows were broken in airport buildings 
tass the soviet news agency said about 60 surfacetosurface 
missiles were fired into the capital 
the sarandoy officer said some of the rockets landed in areas of 
the airport used by soviet troops but he could not give any details 
all civilian flights out of the airport were canceled for the 
remainder of today and for thursday he said 
afghan and soviet forces who base helicopters and transport 
planes at the same airport continued to take off and land after 
the rocket attacks

after immediately after the barrage started

holes wooden and metal chairs lay in a tangled heap 
the debris included the body of a fluffy black and yellow cat 
a wristwatch strap and torn plastic handles from tote bags 
a workman scraped gravel over the pools of blood 
the sarandoy officer was unable to say how big a rocket struck 
the tent or how far it had been fired from according to western 
diplomats the moslem guerrillas fighting soviet and afghan troops 
use rockets as big as 107mm and 122mm which have a range of nine 
to 13 miles 
todays attack was the largest on the airport since the first 
week of september when guerrillas rockets destroyed eight sukhoi 
ground attack jets the number of human casualties in that attack

the government today banned broadcast interviews 
with members of the outlawed irish republican army its legal 
political wing sinn fein and northern irelands militant 
protestant groups 
home secretary douglas hurd announced the immediate ban in the 
house of commons and said the conservative government aimed to deny 
terrorists publicity 
the ban which also applies to any statements supporting the 
organizations provoked immediate outcry from opposition parties 
and civil liberty groups that denounced it as futile and a 
violation of free speech 
hurd who is responsible for broadcasting told parliament 
this is not a restriction on reporting it is a restriction on 
direct appearances by those who use or support violence 
he said it brought radio and tv into line with print media 
which are not affected by the ban in that broadcasters remain free 
to report the content of statements by proviolence groups 
the broadcast ban was done by decree such a restriction on the 
press would require legislation 
the ban forbids broadcasting interviews with members of the 
legal ulster defense association the umbrella group for militant 
protestant organizations as well as the mainly roman catholic ira 
and sinn fein and all other outlawed groups 
the ban on supporters prompted questions in parliament since it 
could apply to other legal organizations sympathetic to the iras 
goal of driving britain out of northern ireland by force 
roy hattersley labor party deputy leader called the measure 
trivial worthless and almost certainly counterproductive and 
said it made the government look simultaneously repressive and 
ridiculous 
have you considered the damaging ways in which this will be 
used both at home and abroad particularly in the united states to 
portray this government as the enemy of free expression 
hattersley said 
hugh dykes of prime minister margaret thatchers conservative 
party said the ban would be a very great mistake because it 
would look as if the government fears the ira can persuade people 
of their sick cause 
the ban applies to the publicly funded british broadcasting 
corp and the commercial independent broadcasting authority but 
not to foreign broadcasting organizations 
it also will not apply to proceedings in parliament and will be 
eased during election campaigns when all parties are supposed to 
get equal coverage from the broadcast media said hurd 
the ban imposed under existing broadcasting laws closely 
follows a 15year ban in the irish republic on interviews with the 
ira sinn fein and protestant groups that espouse violent tactics 
a government source said mrs thatcher decided on the ban as 
part of a package of security measures after an upsurge in ira 
activity including a bomb that killed eight british soldiers in 
northern ireland two months ago 
it was the first time such actions have been taken since the 
mid1950s when similar powers were used against splinter welsh and 
scottish nationalist groups 
the bbc and independent broadcasting authority refused comment 
on the ban 
sinn fein president gerry adams a member of parliament called 
the ban nonsense and said this draconian measure is not an 
attack on the ira or the ability of the ira to operate it is a 
direct attack on sinn fein because our views are unacceptable to 
the british government 
sarah spencer general secretary of the national council for 
civil liberties said the ban would serve only to prevent the 
public understanding the motives which lie behind the violence and 
thereby hinder the search for a political solution to the 
conflict 
a sinn fein statement said 
if we were in eastern europe the british government would be 
crying foul at the banning from tv and radio of a legal political 
party that has parliamentary representation and a mandate from its 
community 
sinn fein commands about onethird of the minority catholic vote 
in northern ireland and has about 60 representatives on local 
councils who stand to lose access to radio and tv

three antiapartheid activists 
who escaped from custody and fled to the us consulate five weeks 
ago emerged wednesday and pledged to resume their opposition to the 
government 
south african authorities say they wont arrest the three who 
had been jailed without charge for more a year before they slipped 
away from police guards and fled to the consulate sept 13 
the activists all senior officials of banned antiapartheid 
organizations spent the next 36 nights in a consular meeting room 
on the 11th floor of a johannesburg office building 
the three said they had little faith in the governments promise 
not to act against them 
our experience with the government is that we must be very 
cautious and not accept anything at face vale said murphy morobe 
but they added they were influenced to leave their sanctuary on 
the advice of jailed african national congress leader nelson 
mandela 
the view of comrade nelson mandela was that we should leave 
the consulate as soon as possible and that assisted us in our 
decision said mohammed valli moosa 
mandelas message was relayed to the men via his wife winnie 
the couple met saturday at the cape town clinic where mandela is 
recuperating from tuberculosis 
we entered the us consulate not simply to secure our own 
freedom but to stir the conscience of south africa and the 
international community about the plight of our fellow detainees 
said valli moosa 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained without charge 
during the 28monthold state of emergency about 1000 are 
believed in detention 
the three smiled broadly as they embraced their families and 
colleagues waiting for them in the lobby of the building scores of 
journalists and about 200 supporters also were present 
the activists gave clenchedfist salutes to the cheering crowd 
mostly young blacks who chanted amandla the zulu word for 
power 
riot police armed with truncheons and shotguns sought to keep 
the crowd under control and police camera crews photographed the 
event 
its great to be out of here said the third activist vusi 
khanyile 
valli moosa and morobe are senior leaders of the united 
democratic front and khanyile is chairman of the national 
education crisis committee morobe and khanyile are black valli 
moosa is indian 
the front is the countrys largest antiapartheid coalition the 
crisis committee was formed to seek greater black control over 
education policies 
the activists later held a news conference at the nearby 
university of the witwatersrand before it began a television crew 
from the staterun south african broadcasting corp was subjected 
to jeers from the crowd and left at the request of organizers 
the three men said they would resume their antiapartheid 
activities although they declined to give specifics 
we would like to continue as before but obviously there are 
major constraints said morobe our major concern is for other 
colleagues in detention 
morobe 32 and valli moosa 31 were detained in 1987 after 
going into hiding when a state of emergency was declared june 12 
1986 khanyile 37 was detained in 1986 
they escaped while undergoing physiotherapy at a johannesburg 
hospital 
before his detention morobe operated from underground as chief 
spokesman for the united democratic front one of the udfs most 
eloquent speakers and writers he played a key role in coveying its 
positions at a time when most of its leadership was in jail or in 
hiding 
the activists said they had cordial relations with the us 
consulate staff but were never offered a meeting with us 
ambassador edward perkins 
we would like to interpret it as a snub but there may have 
been other reasons said morobe he said the three did not 
request a meeting with perkins the first black us ambassador in 
south africa 
in february the government banned the front and other major 
antiapartheid groups from functioning 
it is unclear whether the government will allow them to promote 
the fronts positions freely or whether they will be restricted 
again 
we hope the government will react differently this time 
said morobe we are eternal optimists 
the us embassy said in a statement the us government did 
not negotiate and was not involved in their decision to leave 
they arrived at their decision after consultations with their 
families and advisers 
south african officials did not issue a statement

north korea today proposed creating a new 
nation out of north and south korea with a shared military command 
and a national assembly comprised of an equal number of 
representatives from each side 
the norths deputy foreign minister kang sok ju suggested the 
new nation would be called the democratic confederal republic of 
koryo 
kang told the general assembly that there is no hidden attempt 
to insinuate unification through communization and no intention 
to impose our ideas and system on the other side 
he said peaceful reunification is possible if each side respects 
the others ideology and that the new state would retain the 
separate social systems of the communist north and prowestern 
south 
south koreas un mission said in a statement we think the 
north korean delegations speech this morning appears to be a 
compilation of their past proposals our president yesterday 
tuesday suggested all those proposals of north and south korea be 
discussed at the sumit talks between the two parts of korea 
south koreas president roh taewoo addressed the assembly on 
tuesday 
the authorities of koryo would found and run joint companies 
and common markets and encourage the formation of a new national 
economy for the entire peninsula said kang 
a unified korea would not only leave intact the capital 
invested by other nations in south korea prior to reunification and 
continue to ensure their concessions but also promote new 
investments of foreign capital said kang 
koryo would have a unified military command abolish former 
military alliances and treaties and dissolve the demarcation line 
dividing north and south he said 
the new nation would be the sole representative of the peninsula 
in diplomatic relations with other nations and would hold one seat 
in the united nations he added 
both koreas currently hold nonvoting observer status in the 
general assembly 
koryo would be a neutral nonaligned nation and the 
peninsula would become a nuclearweaponfree zone and ban the 
presence of foreign troops kang said 
about 42000 american troops are stationed in south korea 
vernon walters the us ambassador to the united nations 
called it a thoughtful speech and interesting speech 
i dont think there were any new elements except the tone the 
tone was considerably more conciliatory said walters 
on tuesday roh proposed a summit between the leaders of north 
and south and the signing of a nonaggression pact by the bitter 
rivals 
roh said a summit with north koreas president kim ilsung would 
resolve all the problems raised by either or both sides with 
regard to disarmament arms control and other military matters 
roh also pledged that the republic of korea will never use 
force first against the north 
kang agreed with roh that a summit would have to adopt a 
nonaggression pact but he said the summit also would have to 
cover the issue of reunification 
if the south is not ready to discuss reunificaton said kang 
senior officials could at least meet to hold talks aimed at easing 
military tensions as a step toward eventual top level talks 
he also said the united states and north korea should sign a 
peace agreement that would result in the withdrawal of us troops 
from the south a phased demilitarization of the peninsula and the 
estabishment of a nuclearfree zone 
roh also proposed the two koreas meet with united states soviet 
union china and japan to prepare the groundwork for peace and 
security measures throughout northeast asia he did not offer 
specifics 
allies of the united states and south korea should contribute 
to the progress and opening of north korea by engaging pyongyang in 
expanding relations the president told the 159member world body 
relations between north korea and the united states never have 
gone beyond the symbolic since 1945 when the korean peninsula was 
divided between north and south korea 
the koreas hold un nonvoting observer status because they 
still technically are at war the 19501953 korean war ended in an 
armistice and no peace treaty was signed 
on thursday roh meets president reagan in washington the south 
korean leader is expected to ask washington to improve its 
relations with north korea

south korea will call on the united 
states to improve relations with communist north korea in 
conjunction with similar moves by the soviet union and its allies 
to thaw ties with seoul officials said 
south korean president roh taewoo to meet thursday at the 
white house with president reagan will formally urge the united 
states to take broad measures as soon as possible to improve ties 
with north korea one government official said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said roh will 
brief reagan on his new peace initiatives on the korean peninsula 
and thank him for washingtons support for a successful hosting of 
the seoul olympics 
the united states beefed up its military presence in and around 
the korean peninsula during the seoul olympics and warned north 
korea against disrupting the games which pyongyang unsuccessfully 
sought to cohost the games ended without incident on oct 2 
in a related development north korea today proposed creating a 
new nation out of north and south korea with a shared military 
command and a national assembly comprised of an equal number of 
representatives from each side 
the norths deputy foreign minister kang sok ju suggested the 
new nation would be called the democratic confederal republic of 
koryo and would allow the separate social systems of north and 
south to remain in tact 
his proposal came one day after roh called for a summit meeting 
with north koreas president to sign a nonaggression pact north 
korea and south korea have been bitter enemies since the division 
of the korean peninsula in 1945 
relations between the united states and north korea have never 
developed beyond the symbolic stage the united states fought for 
south korea in a threeyear war against the north koreans in the 
early 1950s 
as a conciliatory gesture the united states allowed limited 
contact with north korea in early 1987 but revoked the decision 
last year after the communist asian state was implicated in the 
november bombing of a south korean commercial jet with 115 people 
on board near burma 
south korea the official said now hopes the united states will 
change its policy again easing visa restrictions and allowing 
limited personnel and trade contacts with north korea 
such conciliatory us gestures are necessary to bolster rohs 
initiatives to improve relations with north korea the official 
said 
roh on tuesday told the un general assembly that south korea 
is ready to end its rivalry and confrontation with north korea and 
would not oppose its allies improving ties with north korea 
it is our wish that our allies and friends will contribute to 
the progress and opening of north korea by engaging pyongyang the 
north korean capital in expanding relations he said 
it is also our position that those socialist countries with 
close ties to north korea continue to maintain positive relations 
and cooperate with north korea even as they improve relations with 
us roh added 
it is unclear how far south korea wants the united states to go 
to improve ties with north korea but the official said we want 
the policies of our allies commensurate with moves by countries 
allied with the north 
south korea bolstered by a remarkable economic revival in the 
last two decades is actively pushing to improve ties with 
communist nations hungary and yugoslavia have already set up trade 
offices in seoul and the soviet union and other major communist 
nations are expected to follow suit 
a few days before the summer olympics opened in seoul last 
month hungary made the surprise announcement that it would become 
the first communist nation to establish ambassadoriallevel 
relations with south korea 
other topics expected to be discussed at the reaganroh meeting 
include washingtons growing trade deficit with south korea 95 
billion last year expected to swell to 12 billion this year the 
official said 
roh is expected to assure reagan that south korea would take 
further moves to open its market preferably to the united states 
he said

gov cecil andrus today banned further 
shipments of lowlevel radioactive waste into idaho until the 
federal government opens a permanent repository for that waste 
any of this waste will be stopped at the border andrus 
declared accusing the government of welching on two promises to 
begin moving millions of cubic feet of temporarily stored waste out 
of the state 
andrus notified energy secretary john herrington of the ban 
after returning from a oneday tour of the governments proposed 
waste isolation pilot project repository in new mexico 
that facility in the desert near carlsbad was to open this month 
as the permanent repository for more then 2 million cubic feet of 
radioactive waste brought into idaho and now stored above ground 
at the idaho national engineering laboratory a research and 
training facility run by the energy department 
the opening however has been postponed until at least early 
next year because of questions raised about its longrange safety 
after his tour the governor said energy department officials could 
give him no firm date on when the site might open 
its an outstanding facility andrus said it appears to 
be well engineered if radioactive waste can be stored safely 
any place in the world this is it 
no more radioactive waste will be accepted in idaho from any 
location outside this state until they have a location where this 
waste will be stored he said 
the temporarily stored waste at inel has built up over the past 
several decades but the bulk of it has been shipped in recent 
years from the federal facility at rocky flats colo 
the government delayed opening the 800 million repository in 
salt corridors some 2000 feet below ground in new mexico because 
of safety concerns raised by some energy department engineers and 
because of a congressional dispute over putting the site under 
energy department control 
andrus discounted the questions of safety and called on 
herrington to begin proceedings to gain control of the land so the 
repository can be opened 
promises have come and promises have gone he said 
promises from doe are no longer good were tired and were 
not going to do it 
andrus acknowledged that he could be legally challenged in 
closing the borders to radioactive waste imports but he added 
im confident that doe is not going to bring material into the 
state when we have said we dont want it 
the state already requires truckers of hazardous wastes to stop 
at border checkpoints for safety and paperwork checks

authorities on wednesday detained 
a former pronazi latvian police commander who had faced 
deportation from the united states for allegedly carrying out world 
war ii atrocities 
boleslav maikovskis 83 was being investigated in connection 
with charges of murder and attempted murder said dortmund 
prosecutor klaus schacht 
maikovskis formerly of mineola ny was picked up at his home 
in muenster because authorities believed he might try to flee west 
germany said schacht a prosecutor in dortmunds war crimes 
investigation office 
maikovskis had applied for political asylum in west germany 
after fleeing the united states last year 
maikovskis is accused of world war ii atrocities including 
burning down a village and shooting women and chidren the soviet 
union in 1965 sentenced maikovskis to death in absentia 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said tuesday 
in moscow that maikovskis shot women and children and added that 
the soviet union is ready to give all the necessary information 
to west germany 
maikovskis had been living in new york since 1951 on friday 
the us justice department said he had fled the country but it 
could not say when 
schacht said investigators based their initial investigation on 
evidence presented at another war crimes trial in west germany in 
1976 during which maikovskis was mentioned several times 
he added his office would welcome any assistance from moscow 
but declined to say whether maikovskis eventually would be deported 
to the soviet union 
west germany has a policy of refusing extradition requests from 
nations that have the death penalty 
the prosecutor declined to give further details about the 
investigation saying the prosecutors are still looking through 20 
volumes of court records relating to the war crimes case in which 
maikovskis was mentioned 
schacht said authorities had determined that maikovskis was 
healthy enough to be held 
he said maikovskis entered the country on a passport issued by 
the latvian government in exile the west german government 
recognizes those documents and issued him a visa schacht said 
on tuesday the nurembergbased federal office that oversees 
political asylum requests said maikovskis submitted a request 
nearly a year ago and that a decision would be made by the end of 
november 
normally the decision is made about a year after submission of 
the asylum request said spokesman wolfgang weickhardt 
maikovskis probably has been living in west germany since 
submitting the request in november 1987 weickhardt said 
he has most likely been in west germany because those seeking 
political asylum are by law restricted from traveling weickhardt 
said 
he said maikovskis could face a criminal trial in west germany 
even if he is granted political asylum 
he could go to trial here that is a different matter from 
receiving political asylum weickhardt said 
in order to be granted asylum maikovskis will have to convince 
authorities that he is being politically persecuted elsewhere 
weickhardt said 
maikovskis was a chief of a nazicreated police force in latvia 
during world war ii he is accused of having ordered the mass 
arrest of residents in the latvian village of audrini and then 
burning the town the 200 villagers later were killed by the nazis 
he is also suspected of taking part in operations that led to 
the deaths of latvian jews gypsies and resistance fighters 
deportation proceedings against maikovskis began in the united 
states in 1976 and dragged on through several appeals his 
deportation was upheld by a federal appeals court in 1985 and his 
final appeal was rejected by the us supreme court in 1986 
the us justice departments office of special investigations 
on friday said it had lost track of maikovskis several months ago 
and had just discovered that he had left the country

inmates at the federal prison at el reno 
used condoms to smuggle marijuana through the prison sewer system 
according to federal officials 
the scheme was revealed when plumberinmate willie taw newsome 
38 was indicted tuesday by a federal grand jury in oklahoma city 
on two counts of conspiracy to possess and distribute marijuana and 
possession with intent to distribute

wire trap installed in the sewer system by another inmate was paid 
in marijuana for his part in the plan 
prosecutors said that on a prearranged date a visitor to the 
correctional center would carry marijuana into the prison concealed 
in condoms visitors are not searched because they remain isolated 
from inmates

the toilet 
newsome would then enter a manhole leading into the pipe and 
retrieved the marijuana 
the indictment says newsome distributed the marijuana to other 
inmates 
conviction could mean 10 years in prison and fines of up to 
500000

unpack your parkas and pull out your 
shovels the woolly bear caterpillars here are pointing to a long 
cold snowy winter 
springfield highway chief philip pike who presides over a 
935600 snow plowing budget hauled out three woolly bear 
caterpillars tuesday and declared its going to be touch and go 
whether the city will have enough funds to clear the streets this 
winter 
pike maintains that measuring the width of the orange stripe on 
the caterpillars and the bushiness of squirel tails is as reliable 
a system as any for the annual municipal guessing game of how much 
money to keep in the snow plowing accounts 
what the heck we have some fun with it and ive got as good a 
record as anyone pike said circumstances permitting of course 
pike made no prediction last year because he couldnt find any 
caterpillars 
on one of the three test caterpillars he unscientifically 
scooped up last weekend the orange band takes up nearly the whole 
body on the other two it is much larger than the brown 
the wider the orange the more snow he allowed and the 
squirrels in city parks have such bushy tails its certain to be 
cold as well he contended

the ad is not alone indeed there are many political spots 
with almost as nasty a tone being aired around the nation but that 
it would be the product of an incumbent senator from new jersey who 
by all accounts enjoys a doubledigit lead in the polls defies 
traditional campaign wisdom 
normally socalled attack videos are the tools of the 
desperate they have wellknown political risks so traditionally 
have been used only in the closing stages of a campaign and only 
when a candidate is holding onto a slim and narrowing lead or needs 
to close a wide gap quickly 
this year the campaign book is being rewritten and university 
of virginia political scientist larry sabato has a name for the new 
strain of negative advertising 
theyre infectious ads sabato says they try to infect 
the opposition with a deadly germ they come from incumbents 
attacking challengers before they have a chance to define 
themselves 
in addition he says there no longer is a welldefined 
progression from biographical ads early in a campaign to positive 
issueoriented ads to negative spots in the late stages 
attack ads have sprouted all over the political map 
in north dakota state rep earl strinden is openly going 
after incumbent democrat quentin burdicks age this isnt the 
old quentin burdick we used to know his ads say of the 
80yearold burdick its time to come home quentin you owe it 
to all of us 
rep connie mack the gop frontrunner in the florida senate 
race is styling his opponent rep buddy mackay as an 
oldfashioned taxandspend democrat his ads conclude in a voice 
dripping with accusation hey buddy youre liberal 
in nevada gov richard bryans attack on incumbent gop sen 
chic hecht criticizes hechts voting record then notes that he was 
voted the least respected senator in washington by a group of 
top senate aides 
in minnesota incumbent sen david durenberger suggested that 
his opponent democratic state attorney general skip humphrey 
shames the memory of his late father hubert humphrey skips 
mudslinging doesnt fit in minnesota the ad said skips great 
late father never would have started a campaign this way skips 
father knew minnesota 
i dont know how you get much more brutal than some of the 
stuff thats out there now said tom mason spokesman for the 
national republican senatorial committee 
negatives are employed now as standard equipment says 
sabato noting that lautenberg went straight to slashing attacks 
when he went on the air after labor day bypassing any positive 
advertising 
that first spot was a segment from dawkins own announcement 
speech with the sarcastic tagline cmon pete be real 
lautenberg insists he wanted to run on his record primarily on 
environmental issues but was forced into negative attacks by 
dawkins distortions of his record 
the latest dawkins spot accuses lautenberg of personally 
profiting from his senate position through investments in companies 
that do business with the government the closing line delivered 
over sinister background music is frank lautenberg hell deny 
anything to get elected as long as he can make some money on the 
side 
that triggered the latest lautenberg blitz which seeks to 
capitalize on reports that dawkins who as a career military 
officer moved around the country frequently is a carpetbagger who 
was shopping for a state to run in 
asked why he would take such a blunt approach while holding a 
substantial lead in the polls lautenberg responded 
if the question is will you stand there and take the abuse 
and turn the other cheek the answer is no i wont and he 
added the audience likes the show you hear negative campaigns 
bemoaned the handwringing unfortunately there are some 
purveyors of ugliness whove found that it pays

125 milligrams of cholesterol compared with an average 278 
milligrams in a standard grade aa egg ardie ferrill supervisor of 
egg inspection for the state department of food and agriculture 
said tuesday in sacramento 
high cholesterol levels in the blood have been linked to blood 
vessel deposits that might lead to artery and heart disease 
the american heart association recommends that an adult keep 
below 300 milligrams the daily dietary intake of cholesterol 
if the doc says you need a low cholesterol diet this is just 
the thing said manager paul may of rosemary farm of santa maria 
where the specialdiet chickens are laying the eggs 
ferrill said the agency ran the eggs through laboratory tests 
before issuing the permit that allows the farm to label its eggs as 
lower in cholesterol he said it was the first such permit issued 
in california 
the eggs were developed in part in consultation with 
university of california scientists and a staff nutritionist may 
said adding that they contain no drugs or additives 
may said about 25 percent of his farms 300000 chickens are fed 
a diet currently being kept secret while lawyers see if it can be

ptl founder jim bakker said today that 
everything he did before leaving the television ministry in scandal 
was for the good of the church and he did not misuse ministry funds 
we believe in our faith that the church is the center of 
society bakker told us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds 
everything we did came under the umbrella of the church there 
was no profit in anything we did 
upon questioning by his attorney ryan hovis bakker tried to 
justify commercial entities such as a water park and various 
lodging facilities and stores at the heritage usa christian retreat 
it was at least when i was there a christian center a place 
where people of like faith could come together to sing and praise 
god in the streets if they wanted to and not have to fear insult 
just because were born again doesnt mean we dont need 
drugstores toothpaste and other needs why should those visiting 
the church have to go elsewhere to have those needs met bakker 
said 
none of the stores none of that activity was there for profit 
for us 
bakker testified as he and his attorneys began their defense 
today in the bankruptcy trial against the ptl founder ptls 
current leadership is seeking 52 million that it says was misspent 
or mismanaged during the bakker era 
at one point reynolds interrupted pushing hovis to get to the 
point of what happened to the money 
i think you need to get into the dollars and cents i think 
everybody agrees it was a wonderful idea but the question is did 
he bakker overdo it reynolds said 
bakker was scheduled to continue his testimony later today in 
the trial which resumed monday in us bankruptcy court after a 
month recess bakker had briefly testified in the case last month 
also testifying for the defense this morning was an auditor who 
said he found the television ministry in sound financial shape when 
bakker left it in 1987 amid a sex and money scandal 
his attorneys questioned allen andrews director of corporate 
finances for lockheed corp who did an audit of financial 
statements and records of the television ministry and heritage usa 
theme park documents dating from the last few years bakker headed 
the ministry 
the statements that i reviewed didnt indicate any negative 
situations andrews said we found the corporation seemed to be 
solvent had good assets and revenues that seemed to be growing 
the audit was conducted over the past several weeks hovis said 
andrews said ptl generally looked like it was in sound 
condition 
he also testified that the considerable travel expenditures and 
cash advances such as those received by bakker before his 
resignation in march 1987 were normal procedure for the chief 
executive of a corporation 
on tuesday bakker said documents he had just received should 
vindicate him against charges he failed to repay the television 
ministry money he used for his own benefit 
he told reporters he was a touch angry he was only now 
receiving canceled checks and reimbursement receipts and hinted 
they may have been purposely withheld 
i think somebody calculated they would hold all the materials 
until the middle of the trial he said though he did not say 
who the former television evangelist predicted his research would 
satisfy at least 90 percent of the internal revenue services 
concerns 
in its suit against bakker his wife tammy and former aide 
david taggart ptl accuses bakker of mismanaging the ministry the 
ministry presented testimony in the first week of the trial in 
september that the bakkers received about 95 million in bonuses 
salaries and other compensationfrom 1983 to 1987 
an irs agent also testified he found cash advances to bakker and 
taggart that apparently served no legitimate business purpose 
the ministry entered bankruptcy protection three months after 
bakker left in march 1987 after he admitted to a sexual encounter 
with former church secretary jessica hahn 
bakker called the suit a trial for my life 
it may be business as usual for everyone else but this is my 
life im talking about he said during a lunch break in the 
hearing in us bankruptcy court 
bakker attorney jim toms said his clients comments about 
possible sabotage really reflect a frustration in trying to 
prove his case based on records scattered among ptl offices a 
federal grand jury probe and bankruptcy court a federal grand 
jury in charlotte nc has been investigating for more than a 
year whether the ministry raised money for one purpose and used it 
for another 
in tuesdays testimony an independent financial analyst james 
wilson said ptls finances from 1978 to 1986 showed it to be a 
healthy growing ministry without financial problems 
also tuesday a former ptl board member said bakker deserved 
every bonus he received while at the helm of the fort millbased 
television ministry and religious theme park 
evelyn spencer told reynolds she and other board members 
consistently voted unanimously in favor of bonuses for bakker 
during the first half of the trial ptl attorneys white and brad 
leggett presented financial records and testimony from ptl 
officials and an irs agent that ptl claimed showed bakker had 
mismanaged the ministry

a man accused of masterminding a scheme 
to claim a 152 million lottery jackpot with a fake ticket pleaded 
guilty wednesday in dauphin county court 
henry arthur rich 33 pleaded guilty to theft by deception 
criminal conspiracy forgery tampering with public records theft 
by unlawful taking and unlawful use of a computer judge sebastian 
d natale waived sentencing until an investigation into richs 
background and character is completed 
rich a former employee of control data corp the firm that 
provides computer services to the lottery faces a 5 to 10year 
sentence for his role in the scam to claim a jackpot from the july 
15 1987 drawing 
richs accomplice mark herbst 33 has already pleaded guilty 
to theft forgery and conspiracy 
herbst a former video store clerk was recruited by rich to 
present the forged ticket on april 28 and split the jackpot 
prosecutors said he later cooperated with the authorities in their 
investigation of rich 
deputy attorney general michael j kane said rich agreed to 
plead guilty to all the counts in return for a concurrent sentence 
defense lawyer harry goldberg said he would ask the court for 
probation or a lesser sentence because rich has no prior criminal 
record and has cooperated with investigators 
rich allegedly altered a computer program to produce a duplicate 
of the winning ticket which had been unclaimed for almost a year 
when herbst appeared at lottery headquarters to claim his first 
check for almost 470000 he told officials that he had been using 
the ticket as a bookmark and had forgotten about it until he read a 
newspaper article on the prize 
several days later lottery officials stopped payment on the 
check and questioned herbst 
two top lottery officials have been required to pay a monetary 
penalty because of their actions in the case 
a new jersey couple later claimed the prize

lloyd bentsen heaping scorn on george 
bush in a mustwin state where the democrats have lost their lead 
said wednesday that only the distortions of the republican campaign 
could allow the vice president to claim hes an environmentalist 
can anyone here give me just one piece of evidence to support 
the claim george bush made the other day when he woke up and 
announced that hes an environmentalist bentsen asked his 
audience of stanford university students 
the democratic vice presidential nominee said bush sat in the 
cabinet with former interior secretary james watt and former 
environmental protection agency chief anne gorsuch the bonnie 
and clyde environmental wrecking crew 
today he said bush is trying to minimize his past support of 
offshore drilling in california while accusing dukakis of opposing 
antipollution efforts by airing television commercials on the 
filth in boston harbor 
theyve been dumping in the boston harbor since a group of 
patriots went down one night and threw some tea overboard 
bentsen said mike dukakis is the first governor of that 
commonwealth to do something about cleaning up the mess 
it was bushs administration that cut off money to clean up 
boston harbor the texas senator said mike dukakis has the 
endorsement of the league of conservation voters and as to george 
bush well hes no friend of the environment 
in boston dukakis picked up an endorsement from russell w 
peterson the republican former president of the national audubon 
society who credited the governor with financing programs to clean 
up the charles river and boston harbor 
quoting sen alan cranston dcalif bentsen said that george 
bush might be an environmentalist it just depends on what 
environment he is in 
dukakis running mate accused republicans of bending the truth 
and refusing to make specific proposals on important issues 
thereby reducing the caliber of a national campaign to that of a 
midwrestling festival out at the cow palace a sports arena 
outside san francisco 
they have forcefed sound bites to the evening news and 
laughed behind the backs of voters demanding some honesty about 
americas future bentsen said 
they have viciously slandered the patriotism and record of 
michael dukakis and then turned around and whistled sweetness and 
light when they are called to account he said 
later talking to reporters bentsen expressed frustration that 
the gop campaign was forcing the democrats to spend their time 
responding to false charges such as a new tv commercial alleging 
that dukakis was opposed to new military projects 
but bentsen said it was necessary to respond so long as bushs 
people dump these kind of lies on the public 
bentsen spoke wednesday in the shadow of stanfords hoover 
tower named after depressionera president herbert hoover on the 
first anniversary of the oct 19 1987 stock market crash 
the tower he said serves as a warning that this nations 
economy still hovers precariously in the shadows of a mountain of 
international and domestic debt 
bentsen was defiantly optimistic about the democrats chances of 
winning the nov 8 election even after learning that a new field 
poll showed bush leading 50 percent to 41 percent in california 
whose 47 electoral votes are the most of any state 
the republicans were trying to dig us a grave and tell us to 
jump in he said well lets tell them to jump in the lake 
were going to tell the experts to eat a little crow on the 
morning of nov 9 and we may let them eat a little quail too 
he said referring to bush running mate dan quayle 
before leaving stanford to fly to kentucky bentsen visited the 
stanford linear accelerator with nobel laureate burton richter and 
sally ride a former space shuttle astronaut who is a research 
fellow at stanford 
asked if she supported the democrats she told reporters she 
would not back either party astronauts are nonnonpartisan 
she said

a florida law to keep felons from 
profiting on stories about their crimes will get its first use in 
the case of a woman convicted in the suicide of her daughter who 
was a nude dancer the state said wednesday 
theresa jackson found guilty of mental child abuse almost a 
year ago in fort lauderdale has agreed to abide by the 
10yearold socalled son of sam law attorney general bob 
butterworth said 
ms jackson 41 thought to be the first parent criminally 
convicted in a childs suicide has agreed to set aside certain 
amounts from any film television or book income she receives 
related to the death of her 17yearold daughter butterworth said 
so far no one has paid for the story of tina mancini who shot 
herself in march 1986 two months after she began working as a nude 
dancer seven months later her mother was convicted of forgery 
child abuse and procuring a sexual performance by a child 
ms jackson who was sentenced to a year in jail is currently 
free on bond appealing her conviction and sentence of the funds 
that would be set aside at least 35000 would go to the state for 
trial costs 
the commitment by ms jackson to comply with the statute is 
contained in a proposed settlement to be presented to broward 
county circuit judge arthur franza who presided over ms jacksons 
monthlong trial 
the defendant has agreed that all such income will go into a 
state trust fund until her obligations under the statute have been 
met butterworth said in a press release issued by his office 
the florida statute is based on a new york law that restricted 
serial killer david son of sam berkowitz from profiting from 
books about his crimes

the rights of eight immigrants accused 
of belonging to a marxist faction of the palestine liberation 
organization were not violated during their deportation proceeding 
an appellate panel ruled 
the fourmember board of immigration appeals rejected the 
argument that the eight seven jordanians and a kenyan were 
subjected to double jeopardy when the government stopped then 
reconvened their deportation hearing last year 
the board tuesday said the suspended hearing should resume 
the eight who all live in the los angeles area were arrested 
in january 1987 and originally charged under the mccarranwalter 
act with advocating world communism because of their alleged ties 
to the popular front for the liberation of palestine they denied 
the accusation 
the government then modified its charges accusing two of the 
eight of subversion and trying to deport the other six on various 
immigration violations 
the immigration judge threw out all the charges may 11 1987 
when the government refused to produce as a witness a key 
immigration official who signed the original arrest warrants 
the next day the government refiled the charges with the 
signature of a different immigration official 
defense attorneys appealed on the grounds that restarting the 
hearing was double jeopardy 
but the immigration appeals board said prosecutors were not 
attempting to start over but rather corrected the 
signature on the arrest orders 
attorneys for the immigrants said they are considering whether 
to appeal the boards decision

authorities are looking into a dying 
mans claim that he had information about the 1963 church bombing 
that killed four black girls even though the mans family and 
friends say he has been having hallucinations 
gary tucker 54 a cancer patient at the veterans administration 
hospital in tuscaloosa told the fbi on friday that he had 
knowledge of the 16th street baptist church bombing authorities 
refused to disclose details of what tucker told them 
one man was convicted in the wellknown case but reports about 
tucker raised the specter that others also knew in advance about 
the racially motivated bombing 
ku klux klansman robert chambliss was convicted of the murder in 
1977 and sentenced to life in prison where he died in 1985 
fbi spokesman charles steinmetz said the agency had not 
developed a case based on tuckers information but turned it over 
to the state prosecutor in birmingham 
jefferson county district attorney david barber said wednesday 
he had discussed the information with bob eddy who was an attorney 
generals investigator on the bombing case barber would not 
comment on whether tucker was a credible informant 
i dont have any comment i can make on it at this point were 
not through doing what were going to do the district attorney 
said were not going to make comments on halfknowledge 
tucker has refused to talk with reporters but his pastor and 
relatives in walker county near birmingham dismissed his claim 
cancer is just eating him up hes had a drug problem in the 
past that crippled him up he had a car wreck that crippled him 
theyre just going to have to take him at face value tuckers 
minister the rev dale olmstead said 
someone in tuckers serious medical condition may make such 
statements to get attention he said 
tucker would have been 29 years old at the time of the sept 15 
1963 bombing during chambliss trial in birmingham witnesses 
talked about seeing other men in a car near the church the night 
before the blast that killed 11yearold denise mcnair and addie 
mae collins cynthia dianne wesley and carole robertson all 14 
two of tuckers uncles also cast doubt on their nephews ability 
to give authorities reliable information 
theo tucker of sumiton said his nephew worked for him about five 
years driving a truck he drank so much alcohol and took so many 
pills that the doctors told me it ate up his brain his uncle 
said 
another uncle cw tucker of sumiton said he didnt know of 
any involvement of gary tucker with the ku klux klan 
and in marietta ga er fields publisher of the 
segregationist newspaper the thunderbolt said he was not familiar 
with tucker at one time i knew most of the boys in the 
birmingham area but the name gary tucker doesnt ring a bell

the blackened facade of a hotel stands as a 
grim reminder of the cloudy morning a year ago when a crippled air 
force fighter slammed into the lobby killing 10 people in its 
fireball 
a small white cross in front of the sevenstory ramada 
innairport bears the words in memory of the 10 the hotel 
remains shut down 
for the families of those who died in the crash on oct 20 
1987 the memories remain vivid and painful 
all the families are just devastated said robert goldberg 
whose 30yearold daughter beth was killed weve had days this 
week that were just as bad as the week after the accident 
goldbergs daughter died when the powerless a7d corsair punched 
through the clouds on an aborted emergency landing attempt and 
slammed into the hotel moments earlier the pilot maj bruce l 
teagarden had ejected safely 
teagarden who was enroute from pittsburgh to his home base in 
nevada had lost his engine and was attempting a second run at the 
indianapolis international airport the pilotless jet slammed into 
the hotel a mile and a half from the runway 
teagarden who was not seriously injured was cleared of any 
wrongdoing and resumed flying eight months after the crash he is 
in advanced training in montgomery ala 
many of the victims families will attend a memorial service 
thursday arranged by the marion county sheriffs department at st 
christophers catholic church

daily reminder of her 26yearold daughter 
i love him even more because hes a piece of her for me to 
hold onto mrs henry said 
goldberg whose daughter was the hotels assistant sales 
director remembers the confusion and terror that he and his wife 
harriet felt after the 22ton jet crashed 
it was a day you never forget you remember the flames the 
smoke chasing around the fear he said we were looking for 
beth and hoping she was going to appear and it never happened you 
ask yourself did she suffer did she try to get out 
larry martin recently submitted a preliminary claim with the air 
force for the death of his daughter dawn shelly martin 19 who was 
a front desk clerk 
martin is a 28year air force veteran who works at a bombing 
range at camp atterbury near his rural edinburgh home 
ive never seen an a7 since october 20th that i dont think 
of my little girl lying there burning he said 
while his coworkers expressed sympathy on his daughters death 
martin says air force officials have ignored his loss 
there is no justice in a society that would allow these things 
to happen and not treat people with dignity and respect he said 
if i still feel this way in a few months ill probably seek 
employment elsewhere 
it hasnt gotten easier this first year said martin 
echoing the feelings of many of the families i hope by next 
spring my attention could get off of this

mammals to move in the direction they must travel if they are ever 
to escape their icy corral 
itll be interesting to see if it works north slope borough 
biologist craig george said as he dodged the slushy spray from 
chain saws chewing through footdeep ice 18 miles northeast of this 
inupiat eskimo community by tuesday night the whales hadnt moved 
to the new holes officials said 
standard oil of alaska donated three chain saws and planned to 
send a digging machine by helicopter to speed the work 
meanwhile a longshot attempt to free the whales with an 
icebreaking barge was delayed until today 
two alaska army national guard skycrane helicopters have been 
rigged to tow the 185ton hovercraft barge from prudhoe bay an oil 
field about 200 miles southeast in a tricky trip across arctic 
ocean ice 
the trip which is expected to take 25 to 40 hours was to have 
started monday or tuesday but was delayed when the barge got stuck 
and was slowed again by refueling plans to get under way shortly 
after daylight today were also put off but rescuers were still 
working through the morning and hoped to leave at about noon 
overnight workers labored to decrease the amount of fuel on the 
barge to reduce its weight by 70 tons 
army national guard chief warrant officer tom williams a 
helicopter copilot said they hoped the barge now that its so 
much lighter wouldnt get bogged down in a goopy mess of mud 
underneath ice close to shore as it had tuesday 
the barge doesnt operate well unless its over water or ice 
it started blowing mud out the sides and bogged down he said 
today as workers began getting ready for another try 
by midmorning alaska time the national guard office in prudhoe 
bay said the muchdelayed rescue mission was now scheduled to get 
under way about noon 4 pm edt but few details of the mornings 
efforts at the site were available national guard spokesman mike 
haller had said earlier that if the barge could not be moved by 
about noon today officials would consider alternatives 
officials hoped to use the barge to carve a 40foot path to open 
water and freedom for the whales the barge pulverizes ice with its 
bulk and the fans that provide lift 
leads in the ice that were as close as five miles last weekend 
have been plugged by shifting winds record low temperatures and 
drifting ice by tuesday night the nearest open water was believed 
to be 100 miles away officials said 
the rescue effort complicated by the harsh arctic conditions 
has become a race against time 
the young whales are tired and at least one has pneumonia 
their barnacleencrusted snouts have been worn raw from grating on 
the jagged ice surrounding the breathing holes the animals were in 
shallow water only a few hundred feet from shore 
last week ice around the holes was so thin biologists did not 
dare walk on it by tuesday with a record low temperature of minus 
13 degrees the ice was 18 to 24 inches thick 
the whales are 24 to 30 feet long but have shown no inclination 
to smash their way to freedom 
their plight has drawn international attention 
on tuesday reagan telephoned army national guard col tom 
carroll commander of the rescue to wish him well 
i just wanted to tell you that everybody down here their 
hearts are with you and our prayers are also with you reagan 
told carroll who was at the helicopter staging area at prudhoe 
bay anything that we can say or do to help you along with the 
success of the operation wed be pleased to do it biologists 
said they were overwhelmed by the interest shown in the whale 
drama scores of people have called with ideas to free the mammals 
such as using explosives dropping bowling balls to break the ice 
or netting the whales for transport elsewhere 
every year probably dozens of grays drown or are crushed by 
the ice but nobody ever knows about it said george 
but ron morris of the national marine fisheries said this case 
is different the whales are a little more than 100 yards from 
shore and are easily viewed 
its simple it happens every time with whales with any 
marine mammals morris said theyre portrayed as gentle 
creatures and the situation out there on the ice is sad its 
really sad

a 123000 fine does not compensate for thousands 
of defective heart pacemakers and corrosionprone batteries sold by 
the cordis corp a federal judge said wednesday in rejecting the 
companys plea bargain 
us district judge stanley marcus pointed to a federal food and 
drug administration presentencing report saying the company 
knowingly continued to distribute the defective equipment between 
december 1983 and october 1985 
i am troubled by this report marcus said it was my duty 
to decide whether this plea agreement and guilty plea served the 
interests of justice i find that they do not 
cordis is accused of 23 counts of selling defective pacemakers 
between 1980 and 1985 the fda said the devices implanted under 
the skin to regulate the heartbeat could stop without warning 
on aug 31 the company had agreed to plead guilty to the 
charges and faced the fine plus 141000 in court costs under a 
deal worked out with federal prosecutors 
in rejecting that deal marcus criticized the government for 
failing to file charges under a 1985 change in the law that would 
have allowed fines of up to 500000 per count instead of the 
maximum 10000 under the older law he set a new hearing on the 
case for oct 26 
the ruling does not affect a separate indictment of four former 
cordis officers who have all pleaded innocent in that case 
after marcus ruling attorneys for both miamibased cordis and 
the government defended the plea agreement 
cordis is no longer in this business and has a new 
management said us justice department prosecutor raymond 
philipps we dont want to put the company out of business 
cordis attorney sherwin markman said the fine is not the only 
penalty that cordis has suffered noting it was required to sell 
off the pacemaker division and has lost tens of millions of dollars 
the company reported net losses of 561 million in 1987 but 
underwent a major restructuring since selling the pacemaker 
operation to telectronics of australia net earnings for 1988 
totaled 24 million on sales of 132 million 
the fda report said that betweeen december 1983 and october 
1985 cordis shipped 2200 pacemakers that were subject to 
potential failure and 6000 batteries they knew were subject to 
corrosion 
but company spokesman chick mcdowell denied that saying cordis 
had never been charged with that offense 
cordis main operations now include making catheters for 
diagnosing and treating heart problems and gauges for monitoring 
pressure on the brain 
when the pacemaker case was announced federal officials called 
it the most significant felony prosecution to date under the 1976 
medical device amendments to the fda law

the city paid tribute wednesday to mikhail 
baryshnikov and his american ballet theater after they wowed a high 
society audience with an effervescent cancan at the european 
premiere of gaiete parisienne 
at a party in city hall mayor jacques chirac praised the 
troupe which is on its first trip to europe in more than a decade 
its return to the french stage tuesday night was a high point in 
the citys cultural season now in full swing with plays concerts 
and exhibitions filling theaters and exhibition spaces the 
company which performs through sunday is part of paris 26th 
international festival of dance 
the troupe romped through opening night with a wicked joie de 
vivre in a fluorescent flash of costumes by christian lecroix the 
rage of french haute couture 
turquoiseruffled tulle dotted chartreuse zebrastriped gloves 
and orange ostrichplumed hats stretching toward the sky the 
splendid costumes were icing on baryshnikovs delectable pastry 
served up at the elegant theater champs elysees 
among the firstnight audience who paid 500 a seat were actor 
jack nicholson director roman polansky the baroness guy de 
rothschild rudolf nureyev prince mubarak al sabah and us 
ambassador joe rodgers 
lecroixs costumes were inspired by the belle epoch and 
toulouselautrec rather than by the more staid second empire which 
was the basis for the costumes in the original production of 
gaiete parisienne 
the ballet was created in 1938 by leonide massine the worlds 
bestknown ballet choreographer between the wars for the ballet 
russe de monte carlo it was performed continuously each season 
from the time it was created until about 1960 but has fallen out 
of fashion and is rarely performed these days 
set to the bubbling music of jacques offenbach the ballet is a 
series of frothy divertissements that tell of the flirtations and 
romantic adventures of the demimonde in the 19th century a flower 
girl and a glove vendor compete for the attention of aristocrats 
soldiers dandies and a naughty mysterious peruvian 
the action takes place in a fantasy cafe where the characters 
enter down a sweeping redcarpeted staircase framed by a pair of 
pink french windows through which glows the eiffel tower 
the centerpiece of the production restaged for the american 
ballet theater by lorca massine the choreographers son is a 
dazzling cancan 
eugenia delarova doll the original flower girl and massines 
wife at the time of the first production once said that the cast 
had so much fun performing the ballet they made the audience want 
to come up on stage and dance with us 
the effect was the same tuesday night with the audience 
breaking into spontaneous clapping as longlegged girls in polka 
dot tights and ruffles kicked high to the familiar cancan melody 
im very pleased said baryshnikov artistic director for 
the company in an interview after the ballet gala audiences are 
known for being very conservative and we were very enthusiastically 
received 
the first half of the program was less successful opening with 
the lackadaisical fandango a mock spanish dance performed by 
five ballerinas le jardin de villandry performed by a trio of 
two men and a woman was reminiscent of the francois truffaut film 
jules et jim 
after the ballet dancers mixed with the beau monde at a dinner 
in the petit palais museum many of those walking past the museums 
collection were works of art themselves dressed in gowns by yves 
st laurent givenchy and of course lecroix 
a string orchestra played at the top of the spiral staircase 
down which ballerinas glided toward candlelit tables and champagne

a federal appeals court wednesday 
stayed the execution of a onetime motorcycle gang leader less than 
12 hours before he was scheduled to die for the rape and murder of 
a tavern waitress 
the execution of george tiny mercer would have been the 
first in missouri since 1965 the action by a threejudge panel of 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals was the second time this 
month the court has blocked an execution in the state the same day 
it was to occur 
missouri attorney general william websters office planned to 
immediately file a motion to vacate the stay with the entire 
10member court 
were filing this motion because we believe the issues are 
easily resolved in favor of the state said mary jenkins a 
spokesman for webster we feel like nine years has been an 
adequate length of time for the appeals process 
mercer 44 was to have been put to death by lethal injection at 
1201 am thursday at the missouri state penitentiary 
in its unanimous decision to grant a stay the threejudge 
panel meeting in st paul minn said it needed more time to 
review mercers case 
if the entire appeals court were to vacate the stay mercers 
courtappointed lawyer douglas s laird could appeal to the us 
supreme court 
us district judge scott wright of kansas city had refused to 
stay mercers execution tuesday citing the incredibily heinous 
nature of the crime 
mercer was sentenced to death in 1979 for the rape and 
strangulation of 22yearold karen keeton at his home in belton 
south of kansas city 
records show friends brought ms keeton to mercer who was free 
on bond in the rape of a 17yearold girl as a birthday 
present during the assault in which mercer forced ms keeton to 
have sex with him at gunpoint before killing her mercers 
11yearold daughter was in the house 
at the time of his conviction mercer was reported to be a 
leader of two morotocycle gangs in the kansas city area the 
rancid riders and the missing links he has contended that 
prejudice against motorcycle gangs is the reason he was convicted 
of killing ms keeton 
mercers execution would mark the states first in 23 years the 
first time the death penalty has been carried out under the states 
11yearold reinstated capital punishment law and the first use in 
missouri of lethal injection 
prison authorities began preparations for execution last month 
after convicted killer gerald smith demanded that further appeals 
be dropped so his execution could be carried out 
smiths scheduled execution oct 4 was blocked by the 8th 
circuit just hours before it was to occur the federal judges 
wanted more time to review smiths competency

actress robin givens said today she would give 
heavyweight boxing champion michael tyson a divorce without taking 
any money from him for herself 
i never wanted anything but what was best for michael 
givens said in a statement read by her lawyer raoul felder i 
never wanted anything for myself and i never sought anything for 
myself 
the statement was issued by felder at a news conference in his

the actress who appears on abcs situation comedy head of the 
class decried the publicity surrounding the divorce action she 
initiated earlier this month and said she wanted tyson and herself 
to go forward with their lives in dignity

offer in money the exact amount of which is not ascertained at 
this time but presumably it will be considerable before it is 
forthcoming i unequivocally and irrevocably state as follows 
1 michael can have his divorce 
2 i will not seek nor accept any money for myself 
tyson was in venezuela and not immediately availalbe for 
comment earlier today the new york post published a story quoting 
him as saying his failed marriage has made him almost 
antiwomen but conceded he still loves givens 
givens filed for divorce oct 7 in california citing 
irreconcilable differences if givens had been able to prove that 
the couple actually resided in california the states community 
property divorce law would have provided that the couple split the 
earnings received during the marriage 
tyson won a a multimilliondollar purse in a heavyweight 
championship bout this summer the couple were married in february 
last friday in trenton nj tyson filed for divorce and 
annulment of their marriage claiming that givens tricked him into 
marrying her by falsely claiming she was pregnant 
im learning so much from this but i wouldnt wish a divorce 
on my worst enemy said tyson 22 in the post interview 
im still madly in love with robin he said but added i 
cant go back with her i couldnt do it i think that she is 
basically a good person but now after all this who would want to 
be with her

with a laugh 
the boxer confessed that the nicest girl ive ever met was 
former miss america suzette charles 25 whom he dated briefly 
before marrying givens in february i shouldve taken my chances 
with suzette but i was too wild back then he said

the crash wednesday of an indian 
airlines jetliner in the central city of ahmedabad is the worst 
disaster in the 26year history of the carrier which has been 
accused of lax safety procedures 
at least 130 people were killed in the airlines 16th major 
accident since it was formed 26 years ago to handle domestic 
traffic and short flights to neighboring countries 
the worst previous accident for the airlines was in 1976 when a 
caravelle aircraft exploded at bombay airport while landing 
ninetyfive people were killed in the crash blamed on leaking fuel 
pipes 
in 1973 49 people died when a boeing 737 made a crash landing 
short of the runway at new delhi airport 
indian airlines is owned by the government as is airindia 
which operates only on international routes 
wednesdays crash comes 12 years after the last fatal accident 
on the airlines but some recent reports have criticized safety 
measures 
in june the pilot of an indian airlines plane forgot to lower 
the landing gear before landing at new delhi the aircraft 
slithered along the runway on its belly but no one was hurt 
india today newsmagazine said in its latest issue that safety 
measures were ignored on indian airlines flights and that pilots 
exhibited a cavalier disregard for their own and passengers 
lives 
mandatory safetyrelated procedures are often reduced to a 
paper exercise the magazine said doctors who conduct 
preflight alcohol tests on pilots sign stacks of reports the 
pilot just fills his name date and flight number 
the airline refused comment 
in september 1986 the pilot of an indian airlines airbus 
aborted takeoff at madras airport after the nose of the aircraft 
was already in the air newspaper reports said heavy concentrations 
of alcohol were found in the blood of the pilot the copilot and 
the engineer of the plane 
indian airlines is the largest regional airline in south asia 
it operates flights to 73 airports in india and nine in neighboring 
countries

a black man once shown in a city hall 
mosaic as a smiling freed slave now carries a hoe and has a 
different smile ending a dispute that started when critics said 
the artwork was demeaning to blacks 
the 10 by 40foot mosaic created in the mid1960s showed 
white settlers in covered wagons and a smiling freed slave 
celebrating his freedom with a broken rope hanging from his wrists 
complaints about the mural started in 1986 but the city council 
did not approve the changes until a year ago the 1200 project 
was financed by private donors 
the new tile work was finished on the mosaic tuesday 
the black man now has a hoe in his hand and the smile that he 
wore was changed a bit its a nice smile said city clerk nina 
baird whose firstfloor office is only a few steps from the 
mosaic its nice to have it over with

ptl founder jim bakker on wednesday 
defended his stewardship of the ministry before it sought 
bankruptcy protection denying an irs claim that the church bought 
him such luxuries as two rollsroyce cars 
we believe in our faith that the church is the center of 
society bakker told us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds 
everything we did came under the umbrella of the church there 
was no profit in anything we did 
bakker took the stand in ptls 52 million lawsuit which claims 
he his wife tammy and former top aide david taggart mismanaged 
the ministry into ruin and used ptl funds for their personal gain 
referring to an irs report listing items it said the ministry 
had provided bakker for his personal benefit bakker said he 
personally paid for a houseboat an unfinished 300foot water slide 
at his home and the two luxury cars 
bakker said he donated the houseboat and cars to ptl as well as 
a third rollsroyce which was given to him 
i had in regular practice given back to the ministry part of 
christianity is giving he said the heritage village church 
has never ever purchased a rollsroyce for me or my family 
bakker said a jet ptl officials claim he used at will for 
personal travel was only actually used by him between 10 and 20 
times 
as far as im concerned all of the trips were for the 
ministry he said 
in other testimony independent financial analyst james wilson 
suggested that bakker was underpaid for the number of 
responsibilities he held bakker he said should have received 
about 65 million a year before fringe benefits tammy faye bakker 
could have been paid more than 2 million a year for her duties 
last month the ministry presented evidence that the bakkers 
received about 95 million in bonuses salaries and other 
compensation from 1983 to 1987 
ptl sought chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors 
three months after bakker left in march 1987 when he admitted to a 
sexual encounter with former church secretary jessica hahn 
bakker said he assumed responsibility for the way ptl dealt with 
ms hahn but said he didnt know about the hush money it offered 
her 
but i knew we were being blackmailed and i take full 
responsibility he responded to a question by his attorney ryan 
hovis 
also testifying for bakkers defense was allen andrews director 
of corporate finances for lockheed corp who audited some of ptls 
financial statements and records for the period of bakkers 
stewardship 
we found the corporation seemed to be solvent had good assets 
and revenues that seemed to be growing andrews said bakkers 
attorney ryan hovis said the audit was conducted over the past 
several weeks 
andrews said ptl generally looked like it was in sound 
condition 
he also said that the considerable travel expenditures and cash 
advances such as those received by bakker before his resignation 
in march 1987 were normal procedure for the chief executive of a 
corporation 
an irs agent has testified he found cash advances to bakker and 
taggart that apparently served no legitimate business purpose 
a federal grand jury in charlotte nc has been investigating 
for more than a year whether the ministry raised money for one 
purpose and used it for another

a regional airline has filed a libel suit 
against the attorney for five crew members who contend they were 
held against their will in a hotel room to undergo drug tests 
the lawsuit says covington lawyer garry l edmondson told 
reporters at a news conference in september that comair airline 
managers shanghaied the pilot and four flight attendants and 
used gestapolike tactics to obtain urine samples 
the suit contends the statements damaged the reputation of 
comair which is based at greater cincinnati international airport 
near hebron ky 
the lawsuit which seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive 
damages was filed tuesday in ohios hamilton county common pleas 
court the county includes the bulk of the cincinnati areas 
newspaper readers and television viewers comair attorney richard 
creighton said 
edmondson said he had not seen the lawsuit and would not comment 
on it except to say sounds desperate to me 
also tuesday six comair executives were charged with 
misdemeanor unlawful imprisonment boone county attorney larry 
crigler said he filed the charges at the request of the employees 
who said they were held against their will 
he said no physical restraint was involved but that the company 
figures used their managerial authority to order the employees not 
to leave 
the five employees say they were coerced into taking surprise 
drug tests the employees say the tests showed no evidence of drug 
use 
the company denies that any of the conduct that is complained 
of was criminal in nature creighton said tuesday the airline 
also has denied liability in civil lawsuits filed sept 22 by the 
airlines employees 
comair fired five other employees including three pilots last 
month reportedly because the five either failed drug tests or 
admitted that they used drugs while off duty the three pilots have 
filed grievances against the company 
the federal aviation administration has proposed a regulation 
that would require random drug screening of ten of thousands of 
pilots flight attendants and other airline employees airline 
labor unions oppose the measure arguing there is no evidence of a 
problem in the industry to warrant it

prime minister sadek mahdi said wednesday 
the death toll from civil war and famine in his country was 20 
times lower than western estimates and he rejected criticism of 
his handling of the crisis 
mahdi said his government has taken great measures in trying 
to help thousands of refugees witnesses describe as being no more 
than skin over bone 
western relief officials who compare the situation in sudan to 
the ethiopian famine of recent years said tuesday that about 
260000 people have died in 1988 because of lack of food and 
medical care during long treks to escape the fighting in southern 
sudan 
mahdi said in an interview with the associated press that i 
dont think the loss of life was more than 10 per 1000 that 
would be the equivalent of about 13000 
he acknowledged that the army which represents the moslems in 
the north has suffered setbacks in recent fighting against the 
southern rebels most of whom are christians or animists fighting 
for autonomy 
but mahdi a moslem said the government has acted effectively 
to help thousands of refugees whom witnesses have described as 
being no more than skin over bone 
the united nations representative has recognized the great 
measures taken by the sudanese government to bring relief to the 
displaced he generally approved the way the situation was 
handled said the prime minister who was interviewed in his 
office in khartoum 
criticism of the government floated by some is misinformed 
said mahdi dressed in a traditional sudanese flowing white robe 
and white turban 
some western relief experts have charged that the government has 
not been effective in easing the plight of the southerners fleeing 
on foot hundreds of miles northward or east into ethiopia 
bona malwal editor of the english language daily the sudan 
times this week criticized the governments relief effort as too 
little too late 
an estimated 2 million people have abandoned their homes since 
the rebellion began in 1983 about 13 million of them set out this 
year alone 
fritz gilbert who heads the us aid program in sudan told the 
ap wednesday that the southern refugees are starving and dying in 
terrible numbers 
he said he has no exact figure but believes there are hundreds 
of thousands of victims the magnitude of the sudanese problem can 
be compared to the famine in ethiopia in recent years gilbert said 
this year about 700000 southerners trekked to khartoum 
150000 to juba in the province of equatoria 300000 to ethiopia 
and 150000 to kordofan and darfur provinces in southwestern sudan 
according to unicef the united nations childwelfare agency 
a usfunded operation to bring relief to the tiny town of 
abyei 500 miles southwest of khartoum entered its seventh day 
wednesday 
gilbert said government and foreign supplies to abyei can feed 
only 15000 until the end of the rainy season this month while 
there are up to 30000 refugees in the town 
the people arrived in terrible shape having trekked hundreds 
of miles gilbert said food was insufficient and they started 
to starve and die kids are in very poor condition 
witnesses who traveled to abyei on relief planes reported that 
they saw thousands of people who were no more than skin over 
bone the witnesses said children seemed to be the worst off 
western relief officials who asked not to be identified say up 
to 10 people are dying in abyei every day 
mahdi said his government regularly reviews the activities of 
more than 90 relief organizations in sudan to check if they are 
operating legally 
some nongovernmental organizations because of their own 
motivations and ideals may have other than humanitation activities 
in mind he said the government has accused some agencies of 
delivering supplies to the rebels and thus prolonging the war 
mahdi said that since taking office in april 1986 he has made 
13 peace offers to renegade army col john garang the leader of 
the guerrillas but has received no firm response 
the rebels have said they captured six army positions in recent 
weeks but the government has acknowledged the loss of only four

the federal aviation administration said 
wednesday it was speeding up an order for more thorough inspections 
of aging boeing 737 jetliners after a row of cracks including one 
a foot long was found on a continental airlines plane 
but faa and industry officials said the cracks discovered by 
continental workers on oct 5 while the plane was being repainted 
may have been caused by the improper patching of the plane more 
than two years ago and not by stress from aging 
federal authorities are asking continental for records of the 
repair work which apparently took place when the plane was 
operated by nowdefunct frontier airlines to determine whether the 
50squareinch patch had been attached properly 
continental absorbed frontier in l986 
the older boeing 737s have been the focus of attention since 
last april when a 20foot section of the roof of an aloha airlines 
plane tore away at 24000 feet a flight attendant was swept to her 
death but the plane landed safely 
the new faadirected inspections have been under review for 
months but were ordered sped up after the discovery of the crack 
on the continetnal plane the order is expected to be issued later 
this week probably friday said faa spokesman bob buckhorn 
the inspections aimed at older boeing 737s with 40000 or more 
landings are not likely to interfere with normal operations 
because the faa will allow the checks to be conducted during 
routine maintenance some air carriers with older 737s likely 
already have begun the inspections in anticipation of the order 
officials said 
it was not clear how many 737s would be subject to the 
inspection order according to the boeing co about 225 of the 
twinengine jets have had close to 40000 landings although some 
of those probably are foreignowned the aloha plane had more than 
89000 landings 
according to the air transport association 570 boeing 737s were 
being operated by us airlines at the end of l987 but many are 
newer models that likely would not be subject to the surveillance 
the planes are widely used by continental united airlines delta 
air lines piedmont airlines usair and southwest airlines 
under the order airlines must conduct the inspections in some 
cases within 500 landings or when the plane reached a total of 
40000 landings and use sophisticated electronic equipment to 
detect small cracks in some areas of the aircraft the faa also 
will require another inspection within 15 months or 4500 
additional landings officials said 
last spring the faa directed the close inspection of horizontal 
lap joints on older boeing 737s where sections of metal skin 
overlap the new inspections also will cover vertical metal skin 
joints require additional use of socalled eddy current 
testing using electronic gear and require paint to be stripped if 
there is a buildup that might hide cracks officials said 
earlier this year a joint faa and industry task force examined 
how better monitor the structural condition of the aging jet fleet 
not only 737s but also many boeing 727s and mcdonnell douglas 
dc9s and recommended a broader inspection program 
but so far only older boeing 737s have been subject of special 
faa inspection orders 
meanwhile two federal agencies are trying to determine why the 
cracks on the continental boeing 737 which had 55000 landings 
were not discovered earlier continental spokesman have said the 
plane was inspected may 20 and no cracks were found 
the jet like the one involved in the aloha incident was 19 
years old and was among the first 291 boeing 737s that used a 
socalled cold bonding method of attaching sections of metal 
skin to the fuselage 
the question right now is when was the repair made who made 
the repair and how was the repair made so far we havent found 
anything said jack gambel a spokesman for the boeing co in 
seattle 
the faa has cautioned against comparing the aloha incident to 
the continental discover because faulty repair work might be 
involved in the continental case 
the rest of the airplane away from where the cracks were 
found didnt have any problem with cracks and that raises the 
suspicion that when the repairs were made they were not done in 
accordance with all the procedures that would be prescribed in the 
boeing manual said faa spokesman john leyden

a man police call a one man crime 
wave has admitted to committing 600 to 700 burglaries in the 
city over the past two years authorities say 
neil patrick green 32 of hartford was held in lieu of 32000 
bail and awaited arraignment wednesday in superior court on 50 
counts of burglary and 44 counts of larceny 
he was a oneman crime wave said detective thomas j murphy 
police said they have tied green to 354 burglaries but they 
said the judicial system couldnt handle prosecution in all the 
cases 
murphy said green succeeded partly because he was a good actor 
when a police officer responded to one burglary green offered 
to help look for the suspect police said another time he 
casually strolled down the sidewalk bouncing a tennis ball 
green once walked past police while carrying stolen speakers and 
twice in one month stole a large television set from the same 
apartment officers said 
he tended to believe that if you didnt exhibit an attitude of 
guilt in most cases youd be able to get away with it said 
murphy 
murphy said green told him that he sold cocaine to finance his 
education at tunxis community college in farmington and got hooked 
on the drug but he gave up dealing when he realized police where 
cracking down on narcotics dealers and turned to burglary murphy 
said 
as greens cocaine habit grew to 300 a day he averaged four 
burglaries a day usually in the morning and early afternoon and 
took about 1000 worth of jewelry electronic equipment and cash 
daily police said he told them 
green admitted to between 600 and 700 burglaries in a written 
statement lt thomas moore jr said he was arrested aug 31

a federal judge on wednesday permitted 
irancontra prosecutors to drop charges here against a former cia 
agent and seek a new indictment across the potomac river in 
virginia 
us district judge aubrey e robinson jr dismissed a 
fivecount indictment that charged joseph f fernandez participated 
in an illegal conspiracy to help arm nicaraguan rebels and later 
lied to cover up his role in the covert operation 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh sought dismissal in order 
to bring the charges anew in federal court in virginia where 
fernandez is alleged to have lied to cia superiors and the 
presidential board that investigated the irancontra affair 
the defense had sought to quash a new prosecution on the ground 
that walsh had improperly brought charges against fernandez in 
washington that should have been filed in virginia 
but in dismissing the charges without prejudice robinson gave 
walsh the opportunity to bring the case before a new federal grand 
jury in alexandria va 
fernandez 51 was indicted june 20 on a charge that he 
conspired with former national security council aide oliver l 
north and arms dealer richard v secord to set up a clandestine 
armssupply network for the contra rebels in defiance of a 
congressional ban on such aid 
the alleged conspiracy took place in washington and elsewhere 
according to the indictment 
fernandez who went by the pseudonym tomas castillo when he was 
the cias station chief in costa rica was also charged with four 
counts of lying to his superiors at cia headquarters in langley 
va about his role in the operation and to the presidential 
commission headed by former sen john tower rtexas the 
questioning by the tower commission also occurred at langley 
according to the indictment 
last month the defense moved to dismiss the falsestatements 
and obstruction charges for lack of jurisdiction 
walsh countered with a motion to dismiss the entire indictment 
saying he wanted an opportunity to prosecute the entire case in 
virginia 
robinson who had sharply questioned prosecutors about their 
tactics at a hearing on oct 6 gave no reason for his decision in 
the onesentence order 
defense attorney thomas e wilson said he was disappointed that 
the judge did not bar further prosecution of fernandez but added 
the independent counsel had 18 months to get an indictment 
returned and its been dismssed in three months

le fouquets the famed caferestaurant threatened 
with closure on wednesday was proposed for listing as a historic 
monument a move that should safeguard the high society haunt 
the regional commission for historic archaeological and 
ethnological patrimony voted overwhelmingly to inscribe the 
building housing le fouquets on the supplementary inventory of 
historic monuments and edifices the commission announced 
the measure which must be formalized within a month obliges 
the landlord to obtain authorization from the ministry of culture 
for any changes in architecture or decor 
the architecture of le fouquets merits preservation because 
it participates elegantly in the urban decor said culture 
minister jack lang 
le fouquets located on a prime corner of the champs elysees 
is wellknown as a gathering place for the rich and famous 
in july it announced it might have to close because of a rent 
increase by the buildings proprietor a kuwaiti holding company 
a committee fearing a fastfood chain in its place was formed 
to try to save the watering hole 
the decision by the regional commission does not completely 
safeguard le fouquets from eventual closure which can only be 
done by classifying the building a proposal the commission 
failed to make 
however the culture minister himself can seek to classify the 
building if he disagrees with proposed changes 
lang said the commission already marked a turning point because 
it ruled favorably on a place of memories rather than a clearly 
historic building 
in other rulings wednesday the commission did propose 
classifying julien a restaurant in the center of paris known for 
its 1900s decor 
it proposed inscribing a number of other eating establishments 
on the supplementary inventory of historic monuments among them 
were lipp on the boulevard st germain bofinger near the 
bastille and pharamond in les halles

the state department welcomed on wednesday 
peace initiatives set forth by south korean president roh taewoo 
but said a cautious approach towards north korea is required 
because of that marxist countrys long record of state terror 
department spokesman charles redman withheld comment on rohs 
specific proposal which calls for a summit meeting with north 
korean president kim ilsung and for a general effort to secure 
peace and prosperity in northeast asia roh spoke tuesday to the 
un general assembly 
overall redman said we welcome the imaginative and 
constructive policy of reconciliation and accommodation that 
president roh is putting forward 
he said the specifics of rohs proposal will be discussed at a 
meeting here thursday between roh and president reagan 
a proposal even more ambitious than rohs was unveiled wednesday 
at the general assembly by north korean deputy foreign minister 
kang sok ju who called for the creation of a new nation out of the 
two koreas with a shared military command 
redman reaffirmed that the united states is reviewing its policy 
toward north korea following the resumption of talks between the 
two koreas at panmunjom and the show of north korean restraint 
during the seoul olympics last month 
there had been concern that north korea would attempt to disrupt 
the olympic games 
redman noted that north korea remains on the us list of 
countries that engage in statesponsored terrorism and any policy 
changes the administration undertakes will not include the removal 
of the pyongyang government from that list 
i would emphasize that north koreas wellestablished track 
record of belligerence and state terror makes a very cautious 
approach to this issue necessary redman said 
among the steps the administration might take officials said 
is the relaxation of restrictions on diplomatic contact between 
us and north korean officials 
the reagan administration reimposed strict limitations last 
january following a terrorist incident 11 months ago in which a 
south korean passenger plane was blown up killing all 115 aboard 
the administration said evidence of north korean involvement in 
the incident was compelling 
a state department official who briefed reporters tuesday on the 
condition of anonymity said the administration will probably have 
an announcement on policy changes toward north korea a few days 
after thursdays white house meeting 
we certainly want to be responsive to president rohs policy 
changes and what he wants to do the official said

former cabinet minister maurice papon has been 
charged with crimes against humanity stemming from his world war ii 
service as a local official in bordeaux lawyers said 
papon 79 who between 1942 and 1944 was secretarygeneral of 
the gironde prefecture near the southern city of bordeaux later 
held many government posts including police chief of paris and 
budget minister under former president valery giscard destaing 
in the early 1980s families of jews deported from the bordeaux 
area accused him of having allowed the arrest of 1690 jews who 
were sent to nazi death camps 
papon has denied the charges which were first filed in 1983 
then dismissed last year because of a procedural mistake in the 
investigation 
gerard boulanger lawyer for some of the families disclosed the 
renewed charges saying they had been filed in july by 
investigating magistrate francois braud who advised only papon and 
his attorneys 
criminal charges in france are not made public but judicial 
sources often tell reporters 
lawyers for families of the deportees complained that the papon 
prosecution has been pursued too slowly and in great secrecy 
if the goal is to let him die of old age that would show a 
refusal to judge antijewish actions when it involves respectable 
personalities from postwar french society lawyer serge 
klarsfeld was quoted as saying in the daily liberation 
klarsfeld and his wife beate were responsible for tracking 
down klaus barbie known as the butcher of lyon for his 
activities as the gestapo chief of the southern french city barbie 
was convicted in 1987 of war crimes for the deportation of jews to 
nazi death camps

the uss wisconsin the last of four huge 
battleships brought back to life by the reagan administration to 
strengthen the navy will be recommissioned this weekend during 
ceremonies in mississippi the pentagon said wednesday 
the return to active duty for the 887foot warship will begin on 
saturday morning at the ingalls shipbuilding yards in pascagoula 
miss former sen john tower rtexas will deliver the principal 
address during the ceremonies the pentagon added 
the wisconsin will join three other world war ii battleships 
that were modernized and returned to service the iowa new jersey 
and missouri 
thanks to the modernization work the four vessels are 
considered among the most powerful surface warships in the world 
each of them features nine 16inch guns capable of firing 
2700pound armorpiercing shells up to 23 miles the battleships 
also carry 12 fiveinch guns and have been modernized with box 
launchers for tomahawk cruise missiles canister launchers for 
harpoon missiles and four phalanx gatling guns to defend against 
aerial attacks 
the wisconsins reactivation began more than two years ago when 
the vessel was taken out of mothballs in philadelphia in august 
1986 and towed to pascagoula the ship is 887 feet long 108 feet 
wide and displaces 58000 tons 
its four geared turbines are capable of driving the ship at 
speeds in excess of 30 knots 
the wisconsin was launched on dec 7 1943 and operated in the 
pacific during world war ii with adm william f halseys third 
fleet earning five battle stars it was decommissioned in july 
1948 but brought back to service again in march 1951 for the 
korean war 
the ship earned another battle star during that conflict and was 
decommissioned again in march 1958 
it cost 4488 million to modernize the wisconsin and return it 
to active duty a figure the navy describes as a fraction of the 
cost of building such a ship from scratch today 
the wisconsin will call norfolk va its home port for now but 
it eventually is to be based at a new navy base now being built in 
texas the ship will be sailed by a crew of 1600

the central committee of the 
sovietstyle party that has governed afghanistan for the past 
decade convened wednesday after dissenters within the party were 
arrested 
also on thursday antigovernment guerrillas fired 21 rockets 
into kabul airport killing nine people and wounding 17 security 
officials said the official kabul radio confirmed the death toll 
but said 18 were injured 
afghan security forces sealed off all streets leading to the 
hall where the 140member central committee of the peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan met 
the meeting was expected to begin last week but afghan and 
foreign sources said the session apparently was delayed by 
highlevel internal disputes 
official sources said on condition of anonymity that the chief 
business at the meeting was national reconciliation the 
governments term for peaceful efforts to halt the fighting between 
usbacked moslem guerrillas and afghan and soviet troops 
afghanistans staterun television said the central committee 
dropped two men from the communist partys 13man politburo 
neither was prominent 
few details of the arrests of party members were made public in 
this country where party and government activities usually are 
veiled by official secrecy 
but one official source said on condition of anonymity that the 
arrests were due to some opposition activity that they were 
launching against the policy of national reconciliation 
he said he didnt know how many were arrested or whether they 
were members of the central committee another afghan source said 
the arrests numbered in the dozens and a western diplomat said he 
had unconfirmed reports that 10 to 15 people were detained 
the party is divided into two factions president najibs 
parcham group and the more hawkish khalq group headed by interior 
minister sayed mohammad gulabzhoi it was not known which faction 
those arrested belonged to 
the politburo members who dismissed wednesday were saleh 
mohammad zarry a longtime prominent party member and zalour 
razinjo former kabul party secretary razinjo is about 30 and was 
the politburos youngest member 
no replacements were announced 
afghan observers said sarry was associated with the khalq wing 
while razinjo had ties with parcham 
as soviet troops withdraw from afghanistan ending nine years of 
military intervention to prop up the government najib increasingly 
has tried to portray his government as separate from the party but 
virtually all its nonparty members have belonged to 
nonthreatening loyal opposition groups or are technocrats who 
worked with the party in the past 
under an accord signed in geneva in april all soviet troops are 
to leave afghanistan by feb 15 1989 the withdrawal started may 
15 and is now half over with an estimated 50000 to 60000 red 
army soldiers still in afghanistan 
some foreign diplomats say the soviets may not want major 
political upheaval until their withdrawal is over they say any 
change in leadership may be little more than cosmetic 
the guerrillas leaders based in neighboring pakistan have 
refused to deal with najib or participate in a coalition government 
the united states and most other western countries have refused 
to recognize the kabul government since the soviet intervention in 
1979 
the guerrillas have continued to rocket kabul and besiege other 
major cities such as kandahar depite the the soviet withdrawal 
wednesdays rocket attack on kabul airport closed it to civilian 
flights for the rest of the day and for thursday said an officer 
of sarandoy a paramilitary force that guards airport entrances 
soviet and afghan troops continued to operate helicopters and 
airplanes from the airport 
the sarandoy officer said only one rocket caused casualties he 
said two soviet women and a soviet girl of about 2 were killed and 
one soviet boy was wounded the rest of the victims were afghans 
he said 
the victims were waiting in a tent outside the airport gate for 
a flight to tashkent and moscow on ariana the afghan airline

peled and miari 
the two leftwing legislators are running for reelection as 
candidates of the progressive list for peace which calls on israel

which gop campaign workers were fired for alleged antisemitic 
leanings had hurt the ticket 
it came up was brought to our attention and we handled it 
with dispatch quayle told reporters who questioned him about the 
dismissals its over and done with 
he insisted the campaign had cleared its name and were not 
going to stand for any attitudes like that 
the brief campaign stop in chicago was a departure for quayle 
who has spent most of his time in smaller towns 
after meeting with jewish backers he briefly toured a job 
training site in an ethnic neighborhood in chicago before heading 
out for a day of stumping across rural missouri 
motorcading across the state quayle toured factories and spoke 
at schools attacking democrat michael dukakis for a dangerous and 
naive approach to foreign policy 
quayle said the gop would make gains by focusing on proisraeli 
policies 
there have been suggestions that growing tensions between blacks 
and jews in the democratic party have left an opening for the gop 
but quayle wasnt asked to address that issue 
if you look at the numbers theyre not where they should 
be quayle said were not going to be satisfied until we get a 
clear majority and we dont have that right now 
republicans quayle said havent done their homework in telling 
jewish voters why they should switch from democrats 
there are a lot of things we have to offer the jewish 
community quayle said 
evidently we havent done as good a job as we should have in 
communicating where the republican party is visavis israel where 
the republican party is visavis the jewish community quayle 
said ill be the first to admit that weve got more work to do 
quayle found himself in the middle of a controversy earlier in 
the campaign when he fumbled answers to questions about the 
holocoust during world war ii but he was not questioned about that 
incident after wednesdays meeting 
in addition spokesman david prosperi said it did not come 
up during the meeting 
we had a lot of good issues come forward quayle said 
he insisted that its realistic for republicans to court jewish 
voters because thats simply one more group the gop can bring 
under its broadening umbrella 
the bottom line is we are committed to expanding our base and 
one of those bases is the jewish community quayle said 
one of the staples of the quayle campaign is a tour of a job 
training site because of his role in crafting legislation which 
created training programs 
on wednesday however he was questioned about the role his 
wife marilyn would play in a new administration 
i dont believe shes crossed that bridge yet or if she has 
she hasnt told me said quayle 
mrs quayle is spending time this week campaigning in 
california while he stumps the midwest 
in missouri quayle stumped in st joseph liberty blue springs 
before heading to kansas city 
he has been focusing on building regional ties in the midwest 
and aides said they planned to continue that theme on thursday with 
yet another bus trip this one in ohio

an american news photographer said wednesday 
that israeli soldiers who shot him during a stonethrowing clash 
tuesday were not in physical danger when they opened fire 
neal cassidy a photographer for the oakland califbased 
frontline newspaper was the first journalist shot in the 
10monthold palestinian uprising 
cassidy who is in good condition at a hospital in arab east 
jerusalem was shot in the right knee with a plastic bullet during 
a palestinian demonstration in nablus 
he said soldiers opened fire after a group of five or six 
palestinian youths began shouting and throwing stones at them he 
said the demonstrators were about 150 yards from the soldiers 
thats a pretty good distance cassidy said from his 
hospital bed they were throwing stones in the direction of the 
soldiers but they were too far to reach 
i didnt have the sense that they the soldiers were in any 
physical danger there was no physical threat 
a photograph cassidy said he took moments before he was shot 
showed five soldiers one with his gun raised standing in the 
street where the incident took place 
the photo also showed a young man standing behind the soldiers 
preparing to throw a stone 
army regulations allow soldiers to open real ammunition fire 
only if their lives are in danger however trained troopers may 
fire plastic bullets for riot dispersal even if the soldiers are 
not endangered 
an army spokesman said tuesday that troops fired in nablus while 
being stoned adding that cassidy endangered himself by being 
close to the rioters in an area the military had ordered closed to 
outsiders 
a 5yearold boy and a teenager were killed in west bank 
clashes tuesday 
cassidy 37 of oakland said he refused to go to a jewish 
hospital for treatment when israeli authorities asked him to 
transfer from an arab clinic after the attack 
i told them i had seen enough of their hospitality he said 
first they shoot me and then they want to take me to their 
hospital i said no thanks 
on wednesday palestinian patients at the hospital several of 
whom said they were injured in the uprising visited cassidy and 
exchanged words of support one arab patient said this place is 
not safe it is like beruit 
cassidy said he has been in the country for about three weeks 
working on a story about palestinians living under israeli 
occupation he said he will check out of the hospital in a few days 
and probably will stay in israel for another two weeks

a church serving a tiny black congregation 
has been set afire twice this year but its pastor vowed wednesday 
were not gonna let anybody force us out 
emotions are running a little too high right now said the 
rev steven jackson after a fire tuesday left only one wall of the 
church standing 
the blaze came just two weeks before the church was scheduled to 
reopen following repairs of damage from an april 16 fire both 
fires have been attributed to arson police have made no arrests 
congregation members in the town 30 miles north of st louis 
probably will rebuild the church a second time on the same spot 
jackson said but a final decision will not be made until early 
next week 
tempers could flare we just need to cool off a little 
jackson said 
we need to clear our minds he said adding there are 
10000 rumors that the fire was racially motivated 
area residents reported the blaze shortly before 3 am tuesday 
and the church was engulfed in flames by the time firefighters 
arrived no injuries were reported 
an fbi agent at the agencys alton office who refused to give 
her name said that the agency had entered the investigation to 
determine whether the congregations civil rights had been violated 
the neighborhood around the church is predominantly white but 
church members said they were unaware of any organized group that 
might be behind the fires 
jackson said a pipe bomb destroyed the building in 1974 
if its racially motivated then somebody is telling us to get 
out and were not gonna let anybody force us out he said a 
lot of the black people who live in the community are kind of hot 
last year the church was defaced with racial epithets said lt 
dennis fischer of the madison county sheriffs department 
police havent ruled out racism as a factor in the fires but 
it could be just a straight act of vandalism fischer said 
i dont have any idea why theyd want to burn it down said 
wesley matlock 71 whose greatgrandparents founded the new bethel 
african methodist episcopal church of rock fork in 1863 
just vandalism or meanness thats all i can say matlock 
said 
the 25member congregation had planned to rededicate the church 
nov 6 jackson said adding worshippers had put about 65000 into 
rebuilding it 
rebuilding could start by november jackson said noting the 
church was insured 
it was built so people could worship god free and clear we 
ought to have a right in 1988 to worship where we please he said 
why would somebody want to run us out

the state department in cooperation with the 
chilean and israeli governments blocked irans purchase last 
spring of usbuilt jets in a deal that arms brokers claimed could 
have lead to the release of four american hostages an official 
said wednesday 
following policy guidelines set down by secretary of state 
george p shultz officials in washington and at the us embassy 
in santiago refused to allow the 12yearold f5 jets to be 
transferred from chile to iran state department spokesman charles 
e redman said 
the chilean government which had bought the planes from the 
united states in 1976 was upfront and the israelis acted 
quickly to stop an israeli arms merchant from participating in the 
scheme redman said 
according to abctv which broke the story tuesday night 
iranians with the approval of parliamentary speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani authorized raymond molina a cubanamerican to tell 
the us government four hostages would be freed if the deal went 
through 
redman said the hostages were introduced only in the final 
stages of a proposal that was rejected under the us policy known 
as operation staunch it seeks to persuade other governments 
and private arms dealers not to provide weapons to iran 
two years ago president reagans secret approval of us 
missile sales to tehran despite the policy set off 
congressional and criminal investigations the idea was to 
encourage moderation in tehran and also bring about the release of 
american hostages 
nine americans are being held in lebanon according to us 
counterterrorism experts by groups under irans influence 
abc said the complicated scheme began last december as iran 
desperate for weapons to use in its war with iraq approached the 
chilean government using a group of arms dealers from argentina 
israel and britain along with several iranians living in europe 
the deal which in its original form would have bypassed the 
us government contemplated sending the f5 jets in pieces by 
ship officially to thailand but in reality to iran for 170 
million abc said 
but after an iranian team got to santiago officers in the 
chilean air force got cold feet and insisted the sale required 
us approval correspondent john mcwethy reported 
under us law while the planes belonged to chile they could 
not be transferred to another country without us consent 
the abc story said this led to an attempt to obtain the secret 
approval of the us government with the assistance of molina a 
cubanamerican in key biscayne fla who had taken part in the 
futile usbacked attempt to invade cuba in 1961 
to convince the arms dealers that he had useful connections with 
the administration abc said molina sent them signed pictures of 
himself with both reagan and vice president george bush 
however there is no evidence that molina a big contributor to 
republican campaigns had any contact with the white house or with 
bushs campaign for the presidency abc said 
in new york iranian un ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati 
said we categorically deny the news reported by abc yesterday i 
tend to believe such sensationalism arises out of the atmosphere of 
the american presidential elections such deals have not been 
attempted or sanctioned the idea of exchanging hostages for 
weapons is a bitter and reprehensible idea 
according to abc harry g barnes the us ambassador to chile 
got wind of the complicated scheme and alerted the state department 
redman said shultz was not involved directly in blocking the 
deal the spokesman said lowerlevel officials at the department 
and in the embassy in santiago applied his policy 
were not going to be a party or arrange in any way for arms 
to be transferred to iran the spokesman said the hostage 
element seems to have come up only briefly and very fleetingly in 
the last stages and it seems to have been raised by the brokers 
not by the iranians 
redman added and as you can imagine again when that issue 
was raised the answer was just as clear no deals 
abc said the deal never got off the ground despite an approach 
by a wealthy argetine to the us embassy in buenos aires and then 
to colin powell the us national security adviser 
the cia neither endorsed nor rejected the proposal while powell 
apparently never replied abc said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater talking to reporters 
aboard air force one during a presidential campaign tour of ohio 
said powell had not been contacted by anyone about the deal 
otherwise fitzwater said the abc report was essentially 
correct and was an example of private individuals trying to get 
into the hostage situation for private gain 
it is not helping the hostages it is not helping our 
relations in the middle east and it is very detrimental to our 
foreign policy the spokesman said

president reagan crisscrossed ohio on 
wednesday for george bush saying prosperity has caused the middle 
class to shrink and america doesnt want to go where the 
democrats want to take the nation 
making several appearances in a state that strategists say 
michael dukakis must carry to have a chance at the white house 
reagan said the democrats have greater problems than whether 
their candidate is likable 
fifteen times in a 15minute speech prepared for a republican 
rally at ohio state university reagan used what he calls the l 
word condemning both dukakis and en howard metzenbaum as 
liberals metzenbaum seeking a third term in the senate is 
opposed by cleveland mayor george voinovich 
at the wood county courthouse in bowling green reagan said the 
republicans would deal harshly with criminals and would continue 
the kind of firm foreign policy that led to a ussoviet treaty 
restricting mediumrange nuclear weapons 
make a false move and the next sound you hear is the clang of 
a jail cell slamming shut the president said boasting that his 
administration has appointed judges who know the meaning of the 
word punishment 
praising the vice president he said george and i also 
believe that a crack dealer with a machinegun who murders a police 
officer in the line of duty should receive the death penalty 
reagan said that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev did 
business because he knew we meant business and we still mean 
business 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
reagan wound up his day of campaigning with an appearance at a 
fundraising affair for voinovich in cincinnati where he linked 
the cleveland mayor to bush and said both have the same goals 
keeping government off the backs of the american people keeping 
taxes down and keeping this nation strong and at peace 
in his three speeches reagan used the word liberal more 
than 50 times in the original text of his bowling green speech 
reagan was to say that he was opening a second front designed 
to assure election of a republican congress with the liberal 
presidential campaign starting to fall apart 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in remarks to reporters aboard air force one campaign chairman 
james a baker iii said it is entirely possible there will be 
joint appearances of bush and baker 
in his columbus speech reagan spoke of watching the 
presidential candidates debate 
i dont often feel sorry for liberals but i came close he 
said i couldnt help thinking the problem with those fellows on 
the other side is not camera angles or lighting its not whether 
their candidate is likable or not 
many analyses of the debate have said that bush came across as a 
more warm appealing personality than his opponent the 
massachusetts governor 
reagan however said the problem the democrats face is that 
where they want to take america america doesnt want to go that 
theyre way over there in left field that theyre out of the 
mainstream of american politics and that their policies are 
liberal liberal liberal 
you may have heard the liberals talk about a smaller middle 
class and its true the president said the middle class is 
getting proportionately smaller but not because a greater 
proportion of people are poor that just isnt so no because more 
people have moved up and become so well off that theyre no longer 
called middle class 
here in ohio he said we have a senate race that draws 
just the same lines between the liberals and the rest of us as are 
drawn in the race for president 
the state has 23 electoral votes

the measure during the first debate with the democratic nominee 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis who has called for even more 
funding for the homeless 
rep charles e schumer dny a chief sponsor said this 
is a noble start but it is only a start it wont even address the 
temporary needs of the vast majority of the homeless 
there needs to be permanent housing for the homeless he 
said the only way to alleviate the needs of the men women and 
children who are homeless is to build permanent housing and this 
bills does not do it

still must win senate approval before it is sent to the white house 
the housepassed bill would authorize 6338 million for fiscal 
1989 which began oct 1 for which 378 million has been 
appropriated in fiscal 1990 6828 million would be authorized

the nations milk production has slowed from 
earlier expectations but still could rise enough to be at a record 
level in 1988 an agriculture department report said wednesday 
part of the slowdown was attributed to higher feed costs 
resulting from the smaller droughtreduced grain harvests 
milk output declined in 1987 to 1425 billion pounds from a 
record 1434 billion pounds in 1986 this years production was 
forecast last spring to rise 2 percent to 3 percent from 1987 
but the departments economic research service said in its new 
outlook report that 1988 milk production may increase only around 
1 percent from last years level but could still exceed the 
record level of two years ago 
milk cow numbers have slipped since january and were almost 1 
percent below a year ago in julyseptember the report said 
meanwhile milk production per cow posted a moderate 2 percent 
rise from a year ago both milk per cow and milk cow numbers are 
expected to weaken further 
the report added that the effects of the higher feed costs next 
year will be magnified because milk production was already easing 
when the drought began as a result of a series of cuts in 
government supports 
if crops are good next year and feed prices decrease 
production probably will strengthen as 1989 progresses the 
report said however 1989 milk production might not match the 
1988 record 
the seasonal rise in retail prices of dairy products in the 
second half of this year will be larger than in recent years 
the report said even so the increase will not be out of line 
with increases in prices of all food or all items 
overall it said consumer prices of milk and other dairy 
products in 1988 will probably average about 2 percent more than in 
1987

the house on wednesday approved and sent to 
president reagan a bill requiring issuers of credit and charge 
cards to give consumers more and earlier details about the interest 
rates and other costs 
approval came on a voice voice the senate also had passed the 
measure by voice vote without discussion last week 
the legislation requires card issuers such as banks and 
department stores to disclose their interest rates fees and grace 
periods at the time on applications and solicitations supporters 
said this will enable consumers to shop around for the least 
expensive product 
under current law creditors are not required to disclose the 
information until the card is issued 
donald g oglivie executive vice president of the american 
bankers association said in a statement after the house acted 
the bill is a victory for both consumers and creditors who will 
benefit from balanced disclosure information 
more than 100 million people in the united states hold more than 
800 million credit cards and have outstanding balances approaching 
150 billion solicitations total more than 25 billion annually 
the measure was endorsed by such consumer groups as consumers 
union consumers federation of america bankcard holders of america 
and a coalition of business and industry groups in addition to the 
aba consumer bankers association coalition of credit card 
issuers national retail merchants association american express 
co and sears roebuck and co 
during house debate last thursday rep fernand j st germain 
dri banking committee chairman called the measure one of the 
most important and strongest credit disclosure acts that we have 
been able to move through the congress since the first 
truthinlending statute was passed 20 years ago 
rep charles e schumer dny the measures chief house 
sponsor said the bill does preempt state laws but that is 
immaterial it is tougher than any state law 
under the legislation individual states cannot enact laws more 
strict than the federal statute 
however rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the banking 
committees consumer affairs subcommittee was displeased with the 
state preemption he said the measure does not go far enough to 
protect consumers 
let me suggest that what americans want in their credit cards 
is not more disclosure but lower interest rates on their 
charges he said there is nothing in this legislation that 
will cause credit interests to fall

a district court judge was shot and 
killed wednesday in her chambers by her estranged husband an 
offduty police officer who fired at other officers before 
surrendering police said 
district judge carol irons 40 the countys first female judge 
was pronounced dead moments after her husband went to her chambers 
to discuss personal matters said grand rapids police chief william 
hegarty 
judge irons came out of her chambers bent over with her hands 
reaching for her throat asking please help me hegarty 
said clarence ratliff 53 a 21year veteran of the police force 
followed her and fired at least two or three more shots 
ratliff then barricaded himself in her chambers the police 
chief said exchanging gunfire briefly with three police officers 
before surrendering 
hegarty said it was unknown whether the weapon was ratliffs 
policeissued revolver ratliff was not on duty and went to the 
court in street clothes he was working as a night patrol officer 
and previously had been a detective said the police chief 
ratliff had no history of mental problems and there was no 
reason to believe irons feared her husband hegarty said they had 
been married four years and were in divorce proceedings it was the 
second marriage for both they had no children together although 
ratliff has children from a previous marriage 
when she told me she was filing for divorce she mentioned she 
thought the worst of it was over and thought it would be much 
easier from then on but there were no indications that there 
was any violence in their marriage or that she was fearful of 
him said judge donald johnston chief district court judge who 
married the two outside the justice hall 
johnston said he spoke with irons moments before the shooting 
and that she appeared fine 
irons called the police dispatcher on an intercom at 1207 pm 
and said her estranged husband held a weapon to her head the 
police chief said 
officers responded quickly because the police department is 
adjacent to the hall of justice they dragged the judge who was 
shot at least once in the throat to a jury room and then across 
the hall to a courtroom 
the courthouse was evacuated during the brief standoff and 
chief district judge donald johnston closed all court proceedings 
for the rest of the day 
irons of grand rapids was elected in 1982 as the first female 
judge in the county she was running unopposed for reelection this 
fall 
before becoming judge she was an assistant county prosecutor 
irons frequently hosted school classes in her courtroom and was 
proud of her role as a model for young women 
i think schoolgirls ought to have professional women as role 
models she said in a 1985 interview with the grand rapids press

three defense contractors are about to embark 
on a twoyear highstakes competition to develop an unmanned space 
rocket for the air force industry officials say 
whoever wins this business is certainly going to be at the 
forefront of the us launch business for a long time to come 
said vince caluori boeing aerospaces manager here for the program 
the air force calls the advanced launch system 
initial development contracts will be awarded any day now to 
boeing martin marietta corp and general dynamics corp air force 
spokesman capt marty hauser said earlier this week 
he would not confirm reports that each contract could be for 80 
million 
the air force wants a lightweight family of launch vehicles that 
can slash the cost of putting payloads in space under the 
development contracts each company will have 25 months to submit 
plans to build a system that will meet the air force requirement of 
lifting up to 160000 pounds of payload to an equatorial or polar 
orbit 
the winner of the development competition can expect billions of 
dollars in business in the 1990s as the air force moves toward a 
first launch of the als late in that decade 
what als represents to us is really the whole next generation 
of launch vehicles said jeff fisher spokesman for martin 
mariettas denverbased astronautics group to stay in this 
business in the long term als is critical 
the martin marietta division teamed with mcdonnell douglas 
astronautics co for the competition developed much of the titan 
launch system for civilian and military satellites a business that 
has generated more than 4 billion 
also hungry for the work is general dynamics space systems 
division of san diego which developed the upperstage rockets for 
titan and the atlas missile systems 
its a very very significant program said general dynamics 
spokesman jack isabel its comparable to when the space shuttle 
got under way 
boeing worked on the saturn rocket booster for the apollo manned 
space missions minuteman missiles and the upperstage booster for 
satellites launched from the space shuttle still its been 15 
years since the saturn program ended a long time to be out of the 
space rocket business 
both our competitors have to be viewed as incumbents 
caluori said we think its going to be one of the toughest 
competitions down the road that weve been involved in 
boeing so far has released one possible design featuring a 
winged vehicle and booster rocket launched with six 
liquidpropellant engines the vehicle would use four aircraft 
engines to land back on earth 
general dynamics initial design calls for an allliquid 
hydrogen and oxygen powered vehicle and booster rocket without 
wings martin marietta has released three designs including 
allexpendable and partly recoverable versions 
the air forces goal is to make rocket launches as predictable 
as airplane flight caluori said 
the explosion of the space shuttle challenger and other 
payloadlaunching setbacks have left the united states with a large 
backlog of satellites waiting to be put into orbit as a result 
some companies have turned to foreign launchers such as europes 
ariane system

three americans won the nobel prize in 
physics wednesday for their work with subatomic particles and 
three west germans shared the chemistry prize for discoveries that 
may be critical in harnessing the suns energy 
americans leon lederman melvin schwartz and jack steinberger 
shared the physics prize for capturing neutrinos in a high energy 
beam to probe the stucture of atomic particles 
chemists johann deisenhofer robert huber and hartmut michel of 
west germany were honored for their work in unraveling a mystery of 
photosynthesis they were rewarded for work completed only three 
years ago indicating the importance attached to their breakthrough 
by the awarding committee of the royal swedish academy of sciences 
many recipients wait decades for recognition 
committee chairman bo malmstrom said their work was an essential 
step toward artificial photosynthesis which scientists hope will 
provide the key to converting the suns energy to mans needs 
the only way in the long run to solve the energy problem of 
the world is to utilize solar energy malmstrom said 
although it had no immediate practical application the academy 
said the research had importance beyond the study of 
photosynthesis the process of converting sunlight into energy 
it said the research could be used in understanding central 
biological functions including the transport of chemical 
substances between cells hormone action and nerve impulses 
the physics award also was for basic research with no practical 
use as yet said bengt nagel secretary of the academys physics 
committee 
some day some kid who is now in high school will find out how 
to use this information to bring benefits to all of society said 
lederman 
the physicists discovered a way to concentrate neutrinos by the 
hundreds of billions into a beam capable of probing the inner parts 
of protons in the same way an xray penetrates the human body the 
academy said 
neutrinos are extremely tiny particles even on the subatomic 
scale with no electrical charge they interact very weakly with 
other forms of matter and could easily pass through a layer of lead 
trillions of miles thick without being diverted from their course 
according to the nobel citation 
the work was the first pioneering effort to essentially put 
together an experiment in which neutrinos which very rarely 
interact in matter at all interact said schwartz awakened 
with the news at his home in san francisco 
the physicists also were cited for discovering the muon neutrino 
the academy said their work opened entirely new opportunities 
for research into the innermost structure and dynamics of matter 
schwartz 55 who left physics to run his own company 
specializing in computer communication came up with the idea to 
use a neutron beam to study radioactive decay after other types of 
beams failed to work 
schwartz once wrote that he discussed the problem with some 
colleagues during a coffee break in 1959 but they were left 
stymied 
that night it came to me it was incredibly simple all we had 
to do was to use neutrinos he wrote in a scientific journal 
the prizewinning experiment was completed and published in 
1961 those poor guys in stockholm have been puzzling over it ever 
since and finally decided it was good stuff said lederman 66 
director of the fermi national accelerator laboratory in batavia 
ill 
steinberger 67 a germanborn naturalized american said he had 
given up hope of winning 
it was not such that you immediately had to give it a nobel 
prize i would have thought it would be honored that way at one 
time or another but i had given up he said in an interview at 
the cern research laboratory in geneva switzerland where he works 
the three were faculty members at columbia university at the 
time of their research 
deisenhofer huber and michel were cited for the determination 
of the threedimensional structure of a photosynthetic reaction 
center 
the work led to better understanding of photosynthesis not only 
in bacteria but in algae and higher plants as well the academy 
said 
in 1982 michel was able to obtain proteins in a crystalline 
form that allowed their structure to be determined the scientists 
worked together to determine their structure 
deisenhofer 45 studied at the max planck institute for 
biochemistry he now works at the howard hughes medical institute 
in dallas 
huber 51 is still at the max planck institute in martinsried 
west germany michel 42 works at the max planck institute for 
biophysics in frankfurt 
the chemistry and physics prizes completed the awarding of the 
six 1988 nobel prizes each carries a 390000 award

north korea proposed wednesday the 
creation of a neutral korean nation in which the socialist north 
and capitalist south would peacefully coexist in a confederation 
meanwhile south korean president roh taewoo pledged wednesday 
to pursue better relations with china the soviet union and eastern 
europe to help free north korea from its international isolation 
north koreas deputy foreign minister kang sok ju told the 
43rd un general assembly that the new nation his country was 
proposing would realize national reunification leaving the two 
social systems in the north and the south as they are 
there is no hidden attempt to insinuate unification through 
communization and no intention to impose our ideas and system on 
the other side kang said 
south koreas un mission did not directly respond to the 
proposal it said in a statement our president roh taewoo 
yesterday suggested all those proposals of north and south korea be 
discussed at the summit talks between the two parts of korea 
speaking before the general assembly on tuesday roh said that 
before reunification could occur mutual trust between the nations 
must be established 
roh also proposed the two koreas meet with united states soviet 
union china and japan to prepare the groundwork for peace and 
security measures throughout northeast asia 
in prepared remarks for a speech to the council on foreign 
relations and the asia society said wednesday in new york we do 
not seek to isolate north korea we hope that the improvement and 
expansion of our relations with socialist countries will stimulate 
north korea into opening itself up to the outside world and 
responding positively to our call for reconciliation and 
cooperation 
the new korea which kang called the democratic confederal 
republic of koryo would have a supreme national assembly with an 
equal number of representives from north and south however he did 
not provide details of how two such different social systems might 
be melded successfully into one nation 
kang said the proposal was first suggested by north koreas 
president kim il sung in 1980 and reiterated last september 
koryo was one of three nations on the korean peninsula 600 years 
ago it preceded the lee dynasty that unified the three countries 
and lasted 500 years before japan annexed korea 
the korean peninsula was again divided at the end of world war 
ii when the soviets ended japanese occupation in the north and the 
allies landed in the south north and south korea are still 
technically at war because the 19501953 korean war ended in an 
armistice with no peace treaty signed 
kang said the new koryo would abolish former military alliances 
and treaties maintain a unified military command and dissolve the 
demarcation line dividing north from south at the 38th parallel 
the new nation would also be the sole representative of the 
entire peninsula in diplomatic relations with other nations and 
hold the sole korean seat in the united nations he added both 
koreas currently hold nonvoting observer status in the general 
assembly 
he also said the united states and north korea should sign a 
peace agreement that would result in the withdrawal of us troops 
from the south a phased demilitarization of the peninsula and 
establishment of a nuclearfree zone he reiterated north koreas 
longstanding position that presence of about 42000 us troops 
hinders reunifiction 
he said the new nation should remain neutral in world politics 
and ban the presence of all foreign troops on its territory 
kang said the leaders of the north and south must discuss the 
confederation concept at any summit 
vernon walters the permanent us ambassador to the united 
nations said of kangs speech i dont think there were any new 
elements except the tone the tone was considerably more 
conciliatory 
on thursday roh is scheduled to meet president reagan in 
washington the south korean leader is expected to ask washington 
to improve its relations with north korea

a suicide car bomb exploded wednesday 
near israels good fence border crossing in south lebanon 
killing seven israeli soldiers and wounding eight others and two 
lebanese civilians the military command said 
in beirut the islamic resistance claimed responsibility the 
same coalition of proiranian fundamentalist groups claimed 
responsibility for a car bomb that wounded three israelis in august 
the military wing of hezbollah the party of god militia based 
in beirut also claimed responsibility according to middle east 
television a christianrun station hezbollah belongs to islamic 
resistance 
the tv report monitored in metulla said the car bomb tore 
apart a minibus full of soldiers 
prime minister yitzhak shamir and other israeli leaders vowed to 
retaliate 
maj gen yossi peled head of israels northern command told a 
news conference the bomb exploded 300 yards north of the border at 
125 pm 725 am edt as two groups of army vehicles passed 
each other one headed home and the other into lebanon 
peled said the blast was so powerful nothing remained of the 
car bomb 
an israeli officer speaking on condition of anonymity said a 
white toyota truck driven by an arab apparently from 
hezbollah exploded amid two convoys totaling seven vehicles 
the commanders got out to talk the toyota came in between the 
two groups of vehicles and exploded he said 
the blast left a crater more than 15 feet wide witnesses said 
they saw pools of blood trees were scorched 
witnesses said the attack vehicle was unrecognizable 
israel created the good fence in 1976 to provide medical and 
other aid to refugees from lebanons civil war it is used today 
mostly by lebanese workers who travel to israel daily 
villagers in south lebanon told reporters the suicide driver 
stopped his vehicle and asked an israeli soldier for a light 
when he saw israeli vehicles he reached inside and set off 
the bomb one said 
some israeli army officials noted that the drivers body was not 
found and said there were indications a remotecontrol device 
triggered the explosion 
peled told reporters we must talk to the survivors to 
ascertain what happened what we know is that the car was 
apparently not parked and when the army vehicles arrived the 
vehicle also arrived and exploded 
israel television said six army jeeps and a minibus were 
involved it showed pictures of charred and heavily damaged 
vehicles usmade m16 assault rifles lay in a heap surrounded 
by vehicle parts 
reporters arriving later were barred from entering lebanon but 
saw a soldier guarding a charred truck and jeep 
the soldier and tv cameramen said the blast knocked down a 
section of the electronic fence 
israel television quoted army experts as saying the bomb 
contained up to 330 pounds of explosives and apparently was readied 
in a south lebanese village 
the blast was heard four miles away and broke windows in the 
small border town of metulla 
scott macdonald an employe of the christianrun voice of hope 
radio station said i felt the explosion as i was walking in the 
house and a saw a blast of wind the explosion was at least a mile 
away so it was pretty powerful 
tour groups visit the good fence site regularly and 
witnesses said australian youths were at the fence shortly before 
the blast none was harmed 
tv film showed medical teams performing emergency surgery in the 
field and victims with arms and legs blown off 
the soldiers who were slightly wounded began to rescue their 
comrades it was amazing they did it under fire as ammunition and 
grenades were exploding around a civilian security officer from 
metulla said on israel radio 
wounded soldiers were flown by helicopter to israeli hospitals 
the army said one was in critical condition peled said two 
lebanese women were hurt 
shamir vowed that israels just and secure hand will reach the 
killers the television reported 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said those sending suicide 
drivers in car bombs should know they will pay the bill till the 
end 
rabin and peled said the incident proved nevertheless the value 
of israels selfdeclared security zone a buffer strip six to 10 
miles deep in south lebanon 
that it happened so close to the border proves the importance 
of the security zone peled said 
the last major car bomb attack occurred yards from metullas 
border fence on march 10 1985 shortly before most israeli troops 
were withdrawn after three years of occupation that attack 
claimed by the prosyrian lebanese syrian socialist nationalist 
party killed 12 israeli soldiers and wounded 14 
hezbollah has been demanding stepped up action to force israel 
to withdraw its remaining troops from south lebanon

the republican brochures denounced wednesday 
by democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis were distributed 
by the illinois gop 
one of them bore the headline all the murderers and rapists 
and drug pushers and child molesters in massachusetts vote for 
michael dukakis and the second one contained a similar message 
but bore a less inflammatory headline vote for vice president 
george bush for president 
the first brochure alleged that convicts in massachusetts have 
the right to vote 
it cited dukakis opposition to the death penalty and his 
support for the controversial massachusetts prison furlough program 
the brochure alleged that dukakis has said that if the death 
penalty were reinstituted in massachusetts by popular vote he would 
commute death sentences 
it said the massachusetts governor supports allowing convicts to 
vote and vetoed a bill to stop letting convicts out of prison on 
weekend passes 
the second brochure cited the massachusetts furlough program and 
specifically the case of willie horton the furloughed convicted 
who raped a maryland woman it said that convicted illinois 
massmurderer would be eligible for weekend passes under the 
massachusetts program 
the material also touched on social security saying that bush 
would never raid the trust fund as alleged by dukakis and 
contending that the massachusetts governor has taken huge sums of 
money from the massachusetts pension funds to balance the state 
budget

the international brotherhood of teamsters on 
wednesday clarified that it is endorsing republican sen dan quayle 
of indiana for vice president along with its endorsement of george 
bush for president 
we support bush and quayle like ham and eggs said teamster 
president william j mccarthy 
mccarthy had announced monday that the union was endorsing the 
republican ticket on the basis of a poll answered by 21207 union 
members showing they favored bush over democratic nominee michael 
dukakis 502 percent to 464 percent 
in a news conference held during a meeting of the unions 
18member executive board at grenelefe fla he said that he 
personally also favored bush 
but when pressed by reporters on whether he also favored quayle 
over democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen mccarthy 
responded look im not going to talk about quayle or 
president reagan or anybody else according to teamster 
officials 
that remark had been widely misinterpreted as an endorsement of 
bush but not quayle 
tim oneill a spokesman for the union said a questionnaire on 
presidential preferences sent to 16 million teamster members last 
month had boxes for checkmarks listing only bush and quayle 
together and dukakis and bentsen together 
the teamsters had endorsed reagan and bush in both the 1980 and 
1984 elections 
but officials in the union had not expected a teamster 
republican presidential endorsement this year because of the 1986 
indictment of thenteamsters president jackie presser and a justice 
department suit in june seeking to place the union under a 
courtappointed trustee 
i was just as surprised as anybody one top teamster 
official speaking on the condition of anonymity said wednesday 
before mondays meeting there was no indication that any board 
members would vote that way 
not all of them did according to other sources close to the 
union 
one speaking on the condition of anonymity said the vote by 
the 18member executive board on endorsing bush and quayle was 117 
at least five teamster board members had actively worked on 
behalf of dukakis 
secretarytreasurer weldon mathis before he was upset by 
mccarthy in a bid for the teamsters presidency upon pressers 
death last july had spoken in favor of dukakis on several 
occasions 
however mccarthy the teamsters top official in boston for 20 
years before taking over from presser had made no secret of a 
dislike he had developed for dukakis during his 10 years as 
massachusetts governor 
teamster vice presidents and board members daniel ligurotis and 
donald peters both of chicago don west of birmingham ala and 
michael riley of los angeles had also supported dukakis 
meanwhile federal election commission records show that the 
teamsters have given bentsen 9000 in campaign funds this year in 
his simultaneous race for reelection to the senate from texas 
but the union also gave quayle 5000 in campaign funds two 
years ago when he was seeking reelection to the senate

the leaders of three major jewish 
organizations seeking to heal a public rift pledged their support 
wednesday to the most prominent proisrael lobbying group and said 
they were not planning a rival operation 
the american jewish committee the american jewish congress and 
the antidefamation league of bnai brith had complained earlier 
that the american israel public affairs committee aipac had taken 
positions that were not in accord with the consensus of the 
organized jewish community 
the complaint in a letter that appeared initially in a story in 
the new york times said the three organizations had established 
a joint political committee for israel in washington 
however the joint statement wednesday said the implication 
in the story that they are contemplating the establishment of a 
lobbying operation in washington that would operate independently 
of aipac is entirely incorrect 
the statement was signed by ira silverman executive vice 
president of the american jewish committee harry siegman 
executive director of the american jewish congress and abraham h 
foxman national director of the antidefamation league 
our three organizations each of which has had offices in 
washington for many years are founding members of aipac have been 
fully supportive of its work and will continue to support it the 
letter said 
the new procedures we have established in washington are 
intended to improve coordination between our agencies and aipac in 
developing policy that will be consistent with the consensus 
of american jewish groups it said 
the purpose of this improved coordination is to enhance 
aipacs effectiveness not provide any alternative to it the 
letter said we expect aipac to participate fully in that 
coordinating process 
foxman in an associated press interview tuesday described as 
hogwash the idea that the hardline stance of aipac was the 
issue 
were united how we feel about the plo foxman said 
but the jewish leader said aipac was mistaken to try to force 
the closing of the palestine liberation organizations un office 
in new york 
and foxman said while there was widespread opposition to a 
us missile sale to kuwait it was poor strategy for aipac to try 
to persuade congress to block the purchase 
meanwhile seymour reich the president of bnai brith who did 
not sign the letter expressed deep concern over the public 
expression of disunity in the jewish community with regard to 
washingtonbased lobbying activity 
he said disagreements among the organizations is best solved 
by individuals not through a public airing in the media 
reich criticized the jewish leaders who called in the letter for 
establishment of a joint political committee for israel in 
washington 
efforts to create a competing lobbying bloc gives the mistaken 
impression that the community has no consensus on peace in the 
middle east he said 
a senior official of aipac told the associated press in a 
separate interview tuesday that this whole episode is bound to 
confuse members of congress 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity from los 
angeles where the group held a board meeting said more 
consultation is always desirable among jewish groups 
he said aipac leaders would meet in washington with the critics 
on nov 3

twelve lawmakers worried that the nations 
nuclear deterrent may be compromised by safety problems at us 
weapons plants asked president reagan on wednesday to reassure 
congress the facilities are being operated safely before their 
reactors are restarted 
unless we solve the current problems at us defense 
production facilities like savannah river we will provide the 
ultimate unilateral concession the unilateral disarming of our 
nuclear deterrent said one of the 12 rep bill clinger rpa 
the energy department shut the only active weapons reactor at 
the savannah river plant near aiken sc in august after the 
plant operator du pont co ignored an unexplained power surge 
while restarting the reactor 
the department has said it plans to start one of the three 
operable reactors in december or january after completing safety 
reviews and improvements with the other two following later in 
1989 
in a letter to reagan the 12 lawmakers said restoration of 
safe operations and reliable production are essential to the 
defense and security of our nation 
there were these other developments wednesday in the nuclear 
weapons manufacturing story 
sen john glenn dohio chairman of the senate governmental 
affairs committee and a longtime critic of the departments weapons 
production activities said he did not agree with a call by gov 
richard celeste of ohio to close the fernald ohio uranium 
processing plant recent congressional testimony revealed that the 
department for years had told contractors to ignore environmental 
pollution there 
the plant is closed by a strike on a visit to ohio on 
wednesday reagan was asked whether the plant should stay closed 
i have word from the secretary of energy that the plant will not 
be opened unless its absolutely safe reagan said 
energy secretary john herrington said the department plans 
further increases in its cleanup budget which doubled to 15 
billion this year in appearances on nbctv and cbstv morning news 
shows herrington said safety and environmental protections were 
adequate but not up to modern requirements 
the natural resources defense council wrote herrington that it 
would sue to prevent the savannah river reactor restart unless he 
pledged by nov 11 to compile an environmental impact statement 
the department said it believed no statement was required 
the three reactors can produce either plutonium or tritium and 
only tritium is currently needed for weapons tritium decays 
rapidly with 55 percent of any amount turning into inert helium 
each year the pace of replenishment and the state of tritium 
inventories is secret but some officials have said there is a 
ninemonth supply of tritium in the pipeline 
recent congressional testimony by doe safety officials has 
revealed a 30year history of mishaps at savannah river often not 
communicated to the department and a disregard of safety among 
department managers 
the signers of the letter to the president glenn clinger and 
10 members of the house including three committee chairmen asked 
reagan to direct the department not to operate the reactors until 
the departments new advisory committee on nuclear safety 
concludes that public health and safety will be adequately 
protected during reactor operations and reported that conclusion 
to congress 
rep mike synar dokla and chairman of the government 
operations environment subcommittee said currently the 
department is not in control of its own defense complex doe is in 
effect a captive of its own contractors 
the department relies on contractors to operate its 16 major 
plants at 13 sites synar said no one was objecting to the use of 
contractors if properly supervised 
the letter asked that the department present a plan within 90 
days showing how it will reestablish management control and 
authority over operating contractors establish clear lines of 
communication and authority and resolve current ambiguities 
over responsibilities for safety 
as for closing the fernald plant glenn said i disagreed with 
that right now he said the plant can be operated safely and 
if you close that plant down itll probably get less attention 
not more 
energy department spokesman will callicott said the department 
believed fernald had been improved to the point at which 
operations pose no significant threat to the environment or to 
public health 
restarting the savannah river reactors the natural resources 
defense council argued is clearly the sort of major federal 
action that requires an environmental impact statement in 1983 
the department won such a suit requiring a statement before the 
reactivation of one of the savannah river reactors after a decade 
that statement took 10 months to write 
thomas cochran the councils nuclear weapons expert said there 
were several dodges the department could use to stretch the tritium 
supply 
doubling the ninemonth pipeline supply could be achieved by 
recharging the weapons to only seveneighths of capacity he said 
this would not degrade the power of the weapon but would require 
another recharge sooner he said delaying recharge of other 
weapons for a year and scavenging weapons coming out of service 
could yield further supplies with only negligible impact on 
military power cochran said 
callicott said of the synar letter we will not operate unsafe 
reactors the advisory committee will review restart 
activities and the department intends to keep congress advised 
throughout the process 
he said he believed no environmental impact statement was 
required to restart the reactors 
white house spokesman bj cooper said the letter had not been 
received there and he would defer to the departments comments 
in wilmington del du pont vice president john mulloy said 
the company had not seen the letter but we have operated the 
plant safely for 38 years and have said consistently that we 
believe the plant is fully capable of safely producing the material 
required to meet the nations defense needs for the foreseeable 
future 
in addition to synar glenn and clinger the letter was signed 
by democratic reps jack brooks of texas mo udall of arizona john 
dingell of michigan phil sharp of indiana dave mccurdy of 
oklahoma david e skaggs of colorado albert bustamante of texas 
and norman dicks of washington along with republican rep frank 
horton of new york

the city of beverly hills succeeded wednesday 
in having a 200000 rollsroyce auto declared a public nuisance 
and barring its owner from parking it in the same rodeo drive spot 
for more than an hour at a time 
five attorneys representing the city convinced superior court 
judge edward kakita to issue a preliminary injunction against art 
gallery owner david spellerberg and his 1954 rolls 
this is the first time a rollsroyce has been declared a 
public nuisance spellerberg said after the 15minute hearing 
only in beverly hills would this happen 
spellerberg has parked the dark blue chauffeurdriven car in 
the onehour spot in front of his national heritage gallery of fine 
art for the past seven months his driver stands by pumping 15 in 
quarters into the meter each day 
i just wanted to put glitter and glamour back on the street 
we sure arent getting that with a pinto but the city of beverly 
hills could care less said spellerberg rodeo drive just isnt 
what it used to be 
were paying 20000 a month in rent and i cant even park my 
own car in front of my own gallery 
spellerberg said he bought the rolls after noticing that 
tourists walking down rodeo drive famous for its posh shops and 
celebrity clientele were frequently heard asking is that all 
there is 
since parking the car in front of the gallery he said an 
estimated 20000 tourists have posed for snapshots in front of it 
he blames the citys action on jealous business owners nearby 
the ruling which imposed the onehour parking limit also compels 
spellerberg to move the car no less than 500 feet in addition 
spellergerg cannot block or use the sidewalk for commercial 
advertisements or promotions 
spellerberg said he isnt giving up his fight but he wont 
disclose his next move 
the city hasnt had any sense of humor in this he said 
they had five attorneys in there this morning i want to know 
what the taxpayers have to say about that

nancy reagan ducked questions on wednesday 
about her borrowed highfashion wardrobe as her spokeswoman 
refused to rule out the possibility that she might receive more 
free fashions 
mrs reagan appearing at a riding center for the handicapped 
refused to speak with reporters attempting to question her about 
the latest flap over designer gowns lent her by leading fashion 
houses 
president reagan denounced the reports which first appeared in 
time magazine over the weekend 
i dont have anything to say about that ridiculous story 
reagan told reporters as he left the white house for a day of 
campaigning in ohio 
mrs reagan queried as she left the national center for 
therapeutic riding only smiled slightly and continued walking as 
reporters asked to speak with her 
white house counsel fred fielding informed the office of 
government ethics in 1982 that even though the ethics in government 
act of 1978 did not require mrs reagan to report the borrowed 
material she would include the information on financial disclosure 
forms 
at that time mrs reagan also pledged to quit using borrowed 
items 
however over the weekend time magazine reported that several 
fashion designers said theyd continued to lend mrs reagan 
expensive clothes since 1982 and neither the first lady nor the 
president has since reported the items as gifts or loans on their 
financial disclosure and tax forms 
one los angeles designer david hayes was quoted by time as 
saying hed made some 60 to 80 madetoorder outfits available to 
the first lady over the years she returned more than half and kept 
the others he said 
a spokeswoman for hayes who refused to identify herself said 
he was in conference on wednesday and unable to take a phone 
call 
mrs reagans spokeswoman disputed hayes account contending 
his number was extraordinarily high 
i havent seen her wear a david hayes in five years said 
elaine crispen 
mrs crispen also took issue with hayes assertion that she 
hasnt returned some of the dresses made especially for her all 
the items that were borrowed have been returned said mrs 
crispen 
the spokeswoman said she did not know what led the first lady to 
break the promise she made in 1982 
i just dont know she made her own rule she broke her own 
rule perhaps because she was told it wasnt against the law i 
just dont know what her personal thinking was mrs crispen said 
the spokeswoman said she couldnt rule out a continuance of the 
practice however 
i wont rule out that possibility that sometime something 
in the future might be borrowed she added 
reagan at the outset of his third and final speech on a 
threecity ohio campaign swing came to his wifes defense 
speaking of the separations and absences caused by political 
life the president said that while hed like to stay longer i 
want to get home to see nancy 
reagan went on to praise the first ladys just say no 
antidrug abuse campaign and added the governments got quite 
an employee there with no salary 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday there is 
no legal problem there is no ethical problem for failing to 
report the items 
there is no consequence fitzwater said 
fitzwater based his statements on statements made earlier in the 
week by donald campbell the no 2 man at the office of government 
ethics who said his agency sees no need at this time to reassess 
the 1982 opinion on the matter

democrat michael dukakis complained bitterly wednesday that his 
record has been distorted by the republicans and said that seems 
to be what the bush campaign is all about george bush accused 
his rival of a rather unrealistic view of americas role in 
foreign affairs 
the democratic presidential nominee traveled by bus through 
small farm communities of illinois and missouri aiming for the 
rural vote and charging bush with favoring corporate operators 
over family farmers 
bush flush with a new batch of goodnews polls called for 
bipartisan congressional agreement on foreign policy concerns he 
promised to convene an early summit of nato allies if elected 
president 
dukakis flashed anger when he was shown a republican brochure 
attacking him as soft on crime 
the brochure said that a convicted illinois massmurderer john 
wayne gacy would be eligible for weekend passes in 
massachusetts under dukakis prison furlough program it asserted 
that murders and rapists and drug pushers and child molesters in 
massachusetts vote for michael dukakis 
friends this is garbage dukakis said holding aloft the 
item mailed by republicans this is political garbage 
with democrats urging him to step up his responses to bushs 
charges dukakis said my positions are being distorted on a 
number of these issues that seems to be what the bush campaign is 
all about 
on the oneyear anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash a 
rumor about the presidential race was blamed in part for a sudden 
afternoon drop in the stock market the rumor making the rounds of 
wall street was that the washington post would publish on thursday 
potentially damaging to bush 
there is no such story said robert kaiser assistant 
managing editor for national news at the post 
bush spoke at the university of michigan where he sought to 
portray dukakis as inexperienced in foreign affairs 
he has a rather unrealistic view of americas role and the way 
in which we lead bush said the liberal massachusetts governor 
seems to think that all we need to do is offer moscow economic 
inducements and a less aggressive less threatening soviet union 
will be the result hes wrong 
bush got a helping hand from president reagan in the industrial 
battleground of ohio reagan used the word liberal more than 50 
times in three speeches denouncing dukakis and sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio 
reagan said the presidential race is a battle between the 
liberals and the rest of us 
where they want to take america america doesnt want to go 
the president said their policies are liberal liberal 
liberal 
bush had been trying to conceal his elation over two new polls 
which showed him widening his lead over dukakis a poll released 
late wednesday by abc news however showed the lead returning to 
what bush had before last weeks presidential debate 
the abc newswashington post poll done oct 12 through tuesday 
put the race at 5245 little different from its 5145 result oct 
511 the survey of 1195 likely voters had a margin of error of 
about three percentage points 
a harris poll published wednesday gave bush a ninepoint 
national lead 53 percent to 44 percent among 1356 likely voters 
surveyed last weekend 
the poll gave bush a smaller lead than the 17 points reported by 
an nbc newswall street journal survey published earlier in the 
week but it was considerably larger than the twopoint edge given 
bush by a harris poll taken a week earlier the harris survey had a 
margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points 
a new field poll in california where the race has been 
considered tight showed bush pulling ahead of dukakis in a 
mustwin state for the democrats 
the survey by pollster mervin field had bush leading 50 percent 
to 41 percent the poll was taken over the weekend after the final 
presidential debate and sampled the preferences of 444 registered 
california voters the margin of error was 47 percent 
at dukakis headquarters in boston campaign officials were 
trying to buy a halfhour of television time on each of the major 
networks the night before the nov 8 election 
dukakis stopped at the pig farm of jim and mabel reed in tiny 
hull ill where he met with local farmers the session was beamed 
by satellite to television viewers in 20 farm states 
he said bushs philosophy was the fewer farms the better 
and that the republicans like corporate operators over family 
farmers 
one farmer asked if dukakis would get mean in the final days 
of the campaign 
am i going to get mean replied dukakis im going to get 
tough you dont want a mean president you want a tough 
president 
a local congressman rep richard durbin dill said dukakis 
has been hurt badly by bush television commercials depicting the 
democratic nominee as soft on crime 
dukakis asked if his message was being obliterated by those 
negative commercials replied that the truth will win out 
were going to get the truth out to the american people 
dukakis said my positions are being distorted i think in 
the last analysis the american people will respond to the truth 
bush campaign manager lee atwater said the vice presidents push 
had shifted into a final phase calling for one major address a 
day and visits to the pivotal bigvote states of california ohio 
illinois michigan and new jersey 
he said bush also would make a major effort in new york a state 
where dukakis has held a small edge 
democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen campaigning 
in california blasted bush for his environmental record and his 
campaign style 
bentsen said the republicans were reducing the caliber of a 
national campaign to the level of a mudwrestling festival 
they have viciously slandered the patriotism and record of 
michael dukakis and then turned around and whistled sweetness and 
light when they are called to account bentsen said 
republican dan quayle met privately with jewish backers in 
chicago and later said republicans havent done as good a job as 
we should have in communicating views on israel and the jewish 
community

michael dukakis accused republicans on 
wednesday of resorting to garbage and distortions in the race 
for the white house citing a republican brochure that says a 
convicted illinois massmurderer would be eligible for weekend 
passes in massachusetts 
friends this is garbage dukakis said holding aloft a gop 
mailing to illinois voters that deals with a controversial 
massachusetts furlough program this is political garbage 
dukakis facing widespread advice from democrats to respond more 
aggressively to bush decided to do so on a crisp autumn day of 
campaigning in rural illinois and missouri in which he also accused 
republicans of lack of concern for rural issues 
but his main text for the day was fighting back 
this isnt worthy of a presidential campaignhe said of the 
brochure which said illinois mass murderer john wayne gacy would 
be eligible for weekend passes in the massachusetts program 
they shouldnt lower the level of a political debate he 
said of the republicans who have used the program to suggest that 
dukakis is soft on crime they should inform the voters and not 
mislead and frighten them 
gacy was convicted and sentenced to death in 1980 for murdering 
33 young men and boys 29 of whose bodies were found in his home in 
the chicago suburb of des plaines 
dukakis also held up a second brochure sponsored by the illinois 
republican party that said all the murderers and rapists and 
drug pushers and child molesters in massachusetts vote for michael 
dukakis 
dukakis toughened his rhetoric during the day telling a crowd 
at a farm in palmyra mo ive never seen such a pack of lies in 
my life 
aides traveling wuith dukakis specifically denied that gacy 
would be eligible for weekend passes under the massachusetts 
furlough program they also disputed the allegation in one of the 
pamphlets that dukakis said he would commute every death penalty 
given to murderers in the event that the people of massachusetts 
voted to reinstate in the death sentence 
earlier in the day dukakis told reporters my positions are 
being distorted on a number of these issues that seems to be what 
the bush campaign is all about 
he declined to say precisely what he had in mind for the three 
weeks remaining to election day 
were going to get the truth out to the american people 
dukakis told reporters after a callin program beamed by satellite 
from a pig farm the first stop of his rural america bus tour 
the massachusetts governor wore a suede jacket over a checked 
shirt and khaki pants for his day in the country at his first 
stop jim and mabel reeds 900acre spread along illinois highway 
57 the backdrop included farm tractors pig pens and silos 
dukakis sat on a bale of hay while he delivered his populist 
rhetoric in terms specially scripted for farmers 
i dont remember any time in this campaign hes expressed any 
concern about family farmers dukakis said of bush he said 
republicans like corporate operators 
from there the bus ride through rolling rich farmland led to 
quincy and an outdoor flagdraped rally downtown 
george bush cares about the people who hold mortgages on 
family farms i care about people who pay them he said 
near the end of his speech he held up the gop mailing and said 
they shouldnt lower the level of a political debate 
the mailing says dukakis supported a program in his home state 
that let murderers rapists and child molesters free on weekend 
passes it recounts the story of an escaped furloughed prisoner 
who brutalized a maryland couple and says if illinois mass murderer 
john gacy had committed his crimes in boston he would be 
eligible for weekend passes under dukakis program 
dukakis said he had accepted responsibility for the 
massachusetts incident and noted that president reagan had 
accepted responsibility for similar incidents in a federal program 
that program he noted is furloughing murderers and its 
furloughing pushers and drug peddlers the people he bush now 
tells us he wants to execute 
dukakis declined to tell reporters whether he would purchase 
time in 30minute blocks on network television to carry his case 
directly to the voters and aides declined to discuss any 
television commercials that might be in production 
dukakis acknowleges he is behind in the race for the white 
house although his aides say the race is far closer than the 
17point margin found in an nbcwall street journal survey 
completed over the weekend in the manner of all lagging 
candidates dukakis insists at every stop that the victory can 
still be won 
even so with only three weeks left in the campaign and the 
presidential debates behind him dukakis and aides have been 
struggling to find a way to turn the tide in their favor

four politburo members resigned 
wednesday rather than face a confidence vote in the communist 
partys central committee which ended its threeday meeting 
without a crisis solution in sight 
another member dusan ckrebic from the serbian republic offered 
to quit after losing a confidence vote the first time that has 
happened since the communists took power in 1945 
the nation is torn by ethnic political and economic problems 
but stipe suvar the communist party chief declared yugoslavia 
will not fall apart he told a news conference there was 
virtual consensus among the leaders for profound changes and 
insisted the meeting had made a step forward in solving its 
woes 
the central committee accepted a proposal from suvar to replace 
onethird of its 165 members over the next six weeks if this goes 
ahead it would be the single biggest sweep through the ruling 
elite since 1948 when stalinists were purged after josip broz tito 
broke with moscow 
but yugoslav leaders remained deeply divided and popular 
criticism of the hierarchy seemed unlikely to abate 
ckrebics defeat in the confidence vote was seen as a blow to 
serbian communist party leader slobodan milosevic whose insistence 
on more serbian control over the autonomous provinces of vojvodina 
and kosovo has deepened yugoslavias political and ethnic rifts 
crkebic an oldtime communist in his 60s was seen as a 
milosevic ally 
ten of the 23 members of the presidium or politburo were up 
for the vote and had been expected to resign nine obtained more 
than the simple majority of 83 required from the full central 
committee membership of 165 but ckrebic mustered only 68 votes 
the resignations of another four members kolj siroka bosko 
krunic milanko renovica and franc setinc were unanimously 
accepted by the central committee nine including milosevic were 
exempt because they hold seats as party chiefs of yugoslavias six 
republics two provinces and the armed forces 
please accept immediately my resignation ckrebic said after 
losing the confidence vote in a secret ballot 
milosevic demanded that ckrebics offer not be considered 
immediately and suvar later told reporters the resignation will be 
discussed at a regular meeting of the presidium in 10 days 
the confidence vote followed heavy public criticism that the 
communist chiefs failed to provide strong leadership calm ethnic 
tension and ease yugoslavias worst economic crisis since world war 
ii inflation is more than 200 percent unemployment is 15 percent 
and the foreign debt is 21 billion 
the economic problems have led to increasing strikes and worker 
unrest adding to the ethnic tensions in a country of more than 20 
ethnic groups 
wednesdays events may well increase ethnic divisions because 
the serbs yugoslavias largest ethnic group were likely to be 
unhappy with the outcome 
serbs have been rallying by the hundreds of thousands to push 
for more control over kosovo an ancient serbian heartland 
bordering albania and now dominated by ethnic albanians 
some of kosovos 200000 serbs called a rally thursday in 
pristina their capital 
the four resigned politburo members gave different reasons for 
their actions but all had come under fire in the staterun media 
and at public rallies 
the staterun tanjug news agency said suvar received 126 votes 
suvar in proposing the central committee changes said an 
extensive list of candidates would be prepared in the next month 
and then voting would start 
in another implicit defeat for milosevic the central committee 
agreed wednesday only to set up a working committee to review 
serbian calls for the ouster from the central committee of three 
kosovo leaders two ethnic albanians and one serb 
in a move that seemed designed to quell potential further 
unrest authorities indefinitely postponed a mass rally in belgrade 
called for saturday 
up to 1 million serbs had been expected to attend the rally to 
express their solidarity with their slav brothers in kosovo

a flawless diamond the size of an egg proved too 
much of a good thing wednesday when its owners rejected a record 
12 million bid as too low and pulled it off the auction block 
it was the second time in two days that a precious stone 
expected to bring a record price was removed from auction without a 
sale 
the polished diamond which weighs 4078 carats the worlds 
second largest was offered by christies on behalf of two new 
york jewelry dealers and the zale corp a dallasbased chain of 
jewelry stores 
although the 12 million bid was the highest ever made at a gem 
auction officials said it was deemed too low and rejected 
this was an experiment said francois curiel head of 
christies jewelry department 
the bidding took place as a christies employee dressed in black 
appeared from behind a revolving wall holding up the diamond amid 
gasps from the audience 
on tuesday the rival auction house sothebys was forced to 
remove from auction the royal red mandalay ruby which was supposed 
to sell for 15 million the high bid of 76 million was rejected 
by the gems owner 
christies would not estimate how much its diamond would bring 
although curiel noted that on april 19 an 8591carat white 
diamond was auctioned for 931 million a record for any gem 
im certain this jewel will set a record price for a single 
precious stone he said before the bidding 
several other lots at the christies sale also were withdrawn 
because they failed to reach the minimum bid those that were sold 
included a 59carat unmounted pearshaped diamond for 555 
million a diamond necklace for 13 million and a 2395carat 
diamond ring for 12 million 
the prices do not include a 10 percent buyers premium 
christies said the sale total was 268 million including the 
10 percent buyers premium out of 402 lots 314 sold it said 
other items sold included a necklace and bracelet of emerald 
beads once collected by the shah jehan builder of the taj majal 
which fetched 370000 and a diamondfringed necklace from the 
collection of prima ballerina dame margot fonteyn for 55000 
christies diamond was described as the largest ever offered at 
a public auction it is second in size only to the 53020carat 
cullinan i set in britains imperial sceptre as part of the crown 
jewels 
the diamond was purchased as an uncut 890carat stone in august 
1984 and took three years to cut and finish 
christies said the gem was unusual both for its rich golden 
color and shield shape and was the largest colored or fancy diamond 
known the gem measures more than 2 inches high 138 inches wide 
and 110 inches deep it weighs about 3 ounces 
sothebys auctioned another diamond tuesday the star of sierra 
leone diamond no 2 for 352 million it is one of 11 stones cut 
from a 969carat diamond discovered in the west african nation in

the national rifle association is offering a 
coloring book featuring dick and janelike characters and their 
friend eddie the eagle to teach children about gun safety but 
educators are wary about using it 
the aim of the sixpage book said nra board member jim 
zangrilli of suburban oak park is to stop youngsters accidental 
shootings with the message that they shouldnt touch any weapons 
they find but instead summon an adult 
its a very cute coloring book he said the cover shows a 
little boy and girl shaking hands with eddie the eagle and it says 
my gun safety book 
the nra wants chicagoarea schools to use the book but the idea 
has received a lukewarm reception from school officials 
if i wanted a program on that topic in schools i surely 
wouldnt go to the national rifle association for help said 
brother donald houde director of administrative affairs for the 
chicago archdioceses office of catholic education he had not seen 
the book 
zangrilli plans to send the book to officials at the citys 
public and parochial schools this week we hope theyll allow 
schools in the chicago area to utilize this thing he said 
chicago board of education spokesman bob saigh said that without 
seeing the book he could not comment he said any proposal from 
the nra would receive appropriate consideration 
zangrilli said the book does not promote the nra or seek to win 
the youngsters over to its positions on gun control he said the 
groups name was written only in small letters on the back page 
were always happy when people join the nra he said but 
thats not the purpose of it the purpose is to stop accidental 
shootings 
he said the message emphasized is that if children find a gun 
they should stop dont touch leave the area tell an adult 
the reality of the real world is theres firearms all over the 
real world zangrilli said we think its a very good idea to 
tell children in the schools not to touch them 
cmdr sollie vincent head of the police departments gang 
crimes unit said that while the message might be important the 
schools probably are not the proper place to teach it 
it seems to me that stressing gun safety in the classroom is a 
fairly negative approach vincent said it assumes that guns 
are going to be available to children and if that is the case 
that is adequate reason for removing guns out of society 
nationally of the 3097 youths killed with guns in 1985 519 
died accidentally according to the most recent figures available 
from the national center for health statistics

the dutch are reliving the painful 
years of wartime collaboration after revelations that countrymen 
who once volunteered as nazi ss members during world war ii have 
been holding secret annual reunions 
the gatherings came to light recently in an interview in the 
weekly vrij nederland with jan rudolf hommes a 70yearold former 
lieutenant in the dutch ss who talked about the reunions 
the ss or schutzstaffeln protection units were founded in 
1929 and originally served as bodyguards to adolf hitler and other 
senior nazi officials led by heinrich himmler the ss later served 
as guards in nazi death camps throughout wartime europe 
the unit also gained notoriety for fanaticism in combat a dutch 
ss unit fought on the russian front the largest nongerman ss unit

the vatican denied on wednesday that it was 
cracking down on brazilian bishops for being too progressive 
italian news agencies quoted the brazilian newspaper folha de 
sao paolo as reporting that in the past month the vaticans 
congregation for bishops had sent letters of warning to several 
brazilian bishops considered too liberal 
the paper reportedly said the vatican had gone on the offensive 
against the bishops for straying from roman catholic teaching 
especially regarding control of seminaries and catholic 
universities 
asked about the report the vatican deputy spokesman the rev 
giovanni dercole told reporters there is no basis for such an 
assertion it is completely false 
a month ago the vatican cautioned liberal bishop petro 
casaldaliga of sao felix do araguaia to remain faithful to the 
teachings of the church 
the brazilian bishop is an exponent of liberation theology 
which sometimes uses marxist analysis and has publicly supported 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government and leftist opposition 
forces in honduras guatemala and el salvador 
the bishop was reminded of some of his duties during a 
recent trip to rome dercole said on sept 24 in particular 
this bishop has been asked to always be fully faithful to the 
teachings of the church and not to interfere in the affairs of 
other roman catholic churches by going to dioceses in other 
countries without the consent of local bishops 
the newspaper reportedly said a new crackdown began after the 
warning to casaldaliga cardinal aloisio lorscheider archbishop of 
fortaleza brazil was among those reportedly receiving the letters

secretary said 
felder stressed repeatedly to skeptical reporters at a news 
conference in his manhattan office that miss givens sought nothing 
from tyson its set final yesterdays news shes taking

new york was the latest turn in the tortuous public destruction of 
her eightmonthold marriage

givens said tyson was manicdepressive and had an extremely 
volatile temper 
days later she called police to their bernardsville nj 
mansion where tyson she said had flown into a rage on oct 7

continuous horror story in which tyson hit her repeatedly threw 
things at her and threatened to kill her

nj claiming his wife married him for money and fame then 
abandoned him he charged that she induced him to marry her by 
pretending to be pregnant

evil and had played a sting game to get at his fortune

no loss for me other than the loss of losing my husband

property or money for herself or anyone else she wants 
nothing from nothing to use a new york phrase from nothing he 
said 
felder said he believed the divorce could best be handled as a 
nofault divorce under california law but that he had not yet 
spoken with tysons lawyers 
in his years as a divorce lawyer felder said ive never seen 
a woman give up money particularly this kind of money ive never 
seen it before

police officers were ordered to wear bulletproof 
vests on city streets wednesday after two officers who didnt have 
on vests were shot to death in separate incidents 
the order issued by police commissioner benjamin ward just 
hours after the tuesday night shootings said the two officers 
might have survived if they were wearing their vests 
officers are issued bulletproof vests during their training at 
the police academy but were not previously required to wear them 
on the job the officers union immediately agreed to the order 
the order covers uniformed officers on patrol but not undercover 
officers and would not have saved the life of one of the men 
killed undercover officer christopher hoban 26 of brooklyn 
he was shot at 710 pm tuesday during an upper west side drug 
raid when one of three cocaine dealers guessed that he and his 
partner were policemen one of the alleged dealers was also killed 
less than three hours later at 945 pm officer michael j 
buczek 24 of suffern was killed when he and his partner 
responded to a routine medical emergency call in harlem and ended 
up chasing two suspicious men 
the officers asked them to stop but they fled the officers 
chased them less than a block before each officer caught up with 
one suspect but one of the suspects spun around and killed buczek 
with two blasts from a semiautomatic weapon ward said 
mayor edward i koch on wednesday called for suspects in 
drugrelated murders including those of police officers to be 
prosecuted under stricter federal laws by us attorneys rather 
than the citys district attorneys 
the stricter federal penalties would include the death penalty 
under proposed federal legislation now on president reagans desk 
in his letter koch described tuesday night as one of the 
worst nights i have ever had as mayor after each killing koch 
and ward met with the families of the officers and reported each 
case at hospital news conferences 
i share the mayors and the police commissioners concern that 
these murderers receive the maximum penalty permitted by law in 
the event the pending federal drug law is passed this office will 
use it as often and as effectively as we can us attorney 
andrew maloney said in a statement 
hobans was shot in the chest and head as he and his partner 
officer michael jermyn 25 both assigned to manhattan north 
narcotics prepared to buy a gram of cocaine at an apartment 
hobans was taken to st lukesroosevelt hospital center where he 
died around 10 pm police said 
one of three suspected drug dealers in the room manuel 
delarosa 23 of puerto rico was killed by the officers during the 
struggle 
jermyn ran into the street and alerted backup police forces 
who caught a second suspect a third suspect identified by police 
as bienvenido castillo 24 remained at large wednesday 
after the second shooting buczek was taken to 
columbiapresbyterian medical center where he died from wounds to 
the chest and abdomen said odonnell 
elvin roberto pena peralta 27 one of the suspects was 
arrested at the scene and was to face a seconddegree murder 
charge police said a second suspect fled and was being sought

eskimo whalers wielding chainsaws worked 
wednesday in a race against time to keep alive three whales trapped 
by arctic ice while a rescue effort using an icebreaking barge 
got under way from prudhoe bay 
two army national guard skycrane helicopters were rigged to 
alternately tow a 185ton hovercrafttype icebreaking barge to the 
whales location about 230 miles to the west 
bitter weather hampered the journey over desolate arctic ocean 
ice expected to take 25 to 40 hours 
the first of the powerful transport helicopters lifted off at 
noon 4 pm edt and the early going was real real slow 
said sheryl deveau a spokeswoman for the rescue effort 
the skycrane was dragging the barge along an inch at a time 
she said with 10 miles of sand bars mud and shallow water before 
the barge would reach smooth ocean ice where the going would be 
easier 
by 430 pm the helicopter had towed the barge about four 
miles from the dock and it appeared things were looking up 
its moving about 7 miles an hour now said mike haller a 
national guard spokesman theyve picked up some speed theyll 
continue on until darkness and then theyll return here for some 
maintenance before picking up the mission again at first light 
workers labored through the night to unload 70 tons of aviation 
fuel to lighten the veco inc barge which has no propulsion 
system the start of the rescue operation was delayed monday while 
the barge was repaired then again tuesday after the craft bogged 
down in mud near shore 
bitter cold and constantly shifting ice trapped the animals in 
shallow water two weeks ago as they were migrating south to warmer 
waters since then they have surfaced every few moments for air in 
holes about 18 miles northeast of this inupiat eskimo village 
north slope whalers have cut at least two new breathing holes 
for the whales but by midday wednesday the animals had shown no 
interest in them the whales appeared tired but holding their own 
biologists said 
john lien professor of animal behavior at memorial university 
in canada said wednesday that the whales should survive for 
several more weeks despite being battered and bleeding from grating 
against jagged ice 
they can bleed a barrel and still be fine said lien who 
has helped free whales from ice for 20 years were talking about 
a big animal here between five to 20 tons 
while a national weather service ice analysis showed no open 
water in the whales vicinity jim brooks the acting director of 
the national marine fisheries service in alaska said a lead or 
pathway through the ice had been spotted about five miles from the 
whales 
there are open water leads throughout the chukchi sea and 
beaufort sea out for a long ways the ice is always moving its 
very dynamic he said 
brooks said there was no guarantee the whales could reach open 
water even if they could get to the leads 
but the hope is that they will be able to make it through the 
leads via these open leads used by bowheads and belugas in their 
migration but the gray whale is not an iceadapted animal it just 
doesnt seem to be able to contend with the ice as well as other 
species of whale he said 
bowhead whales and the smaller belugas migrate together through 
the arctic ocean ice he said the belugas breathe through holes 
smashed in the ice by the larger whales it was hoped that the 
grays might join bowheads migrating nearby and use the same air 
holes brooks said 
on the other hand belugas and bowheads have evolved together 
for thousands of years that makes it highly speculative that the 
grays would do the same thing he said 
the rescue operation stalled late tuesday when the 
helicoptertowed barge bogged down in mud just offshore 
it was a goopy mess said chief warrant officer tom 
williams the helicopters copilot we were able to move the 
barge without that much effort the problem was that apparently we 
went over some shallow mud in that area and the barge doesnt 
operate well unless its over water or ice it bogged down up 
until that point we were moving it 
the fuel taken off the barge by early wednesday was to be used 
for refueling the helicopters said haller he said the helicopters 
would have to fly back to prudhoe bay to refuel 
if it does arrive the barge is to use its fans and its bulk to 
pulverize the ice beneath it and fashion a 40foot swath to open 
water 
but if more hitches caused the mission to be scrubbed the 
helicopter crews were experimenting with an alternative which 
involved using a 9000pound steelreinforced concrete cylinder to 
smash holes in the ice williams said 
he said a leftover support from construction of the transalaska 
oil pipeline had been fitted so that it could be carried by the 
helicopters its cylindrical about four feet in diameter by 
five feet tall with points on one end to make it go through the 
ice easier he said 
rescuers had hoped the support could be dropped through the ice 
and dragged to create a channel 
we went out and experimented with it williams said we 
werent able to drag it if we used it we would have to punch hole 
after hole after hole the dragging part didnt work everytime you 
punch a hole the cracks get larger they expand and seem to 
enlarge 
it would be very laborious if we had to make a solid string of 
water six miles long he said

portauprince haiti ap haitian leader lt gen prosper 
avril joined hundreds of troops wednesday at a special mass for 
army unity after a group of soldiers tried to overthrow the new 
military government this week 
hours after the mass about 100 young people held a sitin in 
front of the portauprince cathedral to protest a church order 
telling a popular priest rev jean bertrand aristide to leave the 
country 
it was the fifth such demonstration in a week an attack on 
aristides congregation by armed thugs who killed 12 people and 
wounded 70 helped bring about the coup that swept avril into power 
last month 
the mass at the national palace in this capital city broadcast 
by the staterun television nationale was attended by members of 
the army high command hundreds of uniformed soldiers of the 
presidential guard cabinet members and avrils wife and daughter 
television nationale said tuesday night that six officers and 
soldiers were discharged from the army because of their role in 
sundays coup attempt 
centrist politicians say the failed coup was an attempt by a 
handful of soldiers close to the deposed duvalier dynasty to regain 
control after a soldiers revolt ousted lt gen henri namphy as 
the national leader on sept 17the revolt also forced out dozens 
of unpopular officers 
however leftist groups claim the coup attempt was a move 
engineered by avril to get rid of soldiers demanding radical 
reforms 
namphy took over after dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled to 
france in february 1986 ending 29 years of repressive family rule 
namphy left power for four months after a militarybacked civilian 
won national elections but seized control again earlier this year 
the young protesters meanwhile accused haitis conservative 
bishops of trying to get rid of aristide because of his radical 
sermons urging the poor to fight for social justice 
it is obvious that the decision to transfer aristide against 
the manifest desire of the majority of haitians is inexplicable 
without the persistent influence of rome on certain personalities 
in haiti the rev antoine adrien another member of the churchs 
radical wing said wednesday 
aristide said in a statement read by the churchs radio soleil 
that he had received an order from rome to leave haiti by last 
monday however a friend of the priest speaking on condition of 
anonymity said aristide was still in haiti on wednesday

winning the nobel prize on wednesday gave an illinois physicist 
who plans to return to teaching a platform to promote science as 
a tremendous career to follow as four of six winners received 
the good news in the united states 
johann deisenhofer a dallasbased researcher and west german 
colleagues robert huber and hartmut michel won the nobel prize in 
chemistry for work done in germany to determine the structure of 
certain proteins needed in photosynthesis 
michel 42 was visiting yale universitys medical school in new 
haven conn when he learned he had been selected by the nobel 
awarding committee of the royal swedish academy of sciences 
actually i was starting to tremble i had my coffee in my 
hand i had to put it away later he delivered a scheduled 
lecture to an audience whose members were not surprised their guest 
had become a nobel recipient said yale professor donald engelman 
deisenhofer 45 said he was in the shower when the phone rang 
and was really upset until he learned that it was a call to 
nobel fame 
i am not a quick starter in the morning it took me about an 
hour to really be sure that this was not a dream he said 
americans leon lederman melvin schwartz and jack steinberger 
won the nobel prize in physics for research conducted at columbia 
university in 1961 into the subatomic particle called a neutrino 
the award announcement said the work opened entirely new 
opportunities for research into the innermost structure and 
dynamics of matter 
the research has no practical significance other than very 
long term said schwartz head of digital pathways inc in 
mountain view calif if you understand something better sooner 
or later it will be practical 
someday some kid who is now in high school will find out how 
to use this information to bring benefits to all of society said 
lederman 66 director of the fermi national accelerator laboratory 
in batavia ill 
with hopes of encouraging young people to get interested in 
science lederman is giving up his job as head of the governments 
atom smashing laboratory to take a teaching position at the 
university of chicago 
university spokesman larry arbeiter said lederman would in march 
begin teaching not only graduate students in physics but also 
undergraduate science students and liberal arts majors 
its unusual for somebody of his stature to be teaching people 
so early in their careers and even people who arent scientists 
at all arbeiter said hes a very articulate energetic man 
and hes the perfect person to get people interested in science 
science is a tremendous career to follow lederman said 
you have fun all the time some blood sweat and tears too 
but it is ultimately rewarding he said 
each nobel prize carries a 390000 award none of the winners 
announced any immediate plans for spending the money 
schwartz a 55yearold former stanford university professor 
founded digital pathways in the 1970s as an attempt to 
participate in all the excitement of silicon valley he said the 
firm deals with data communications in the security field building 
computer systems with an ability to keep hackers out

irans un ambassador said wednesday that 
iran has no objection to starting the process of sending home all 
prisoners of war from the persian gulf conflict and hinted the sick 
and injured might be freed first 
mohammad jaafar mahallati noted however that some technical 
issues still must be resolved in the iraniraq peace talks and 
repatriation cannot be completed until they are settled 
according to the red cross iran has 50182 prisoners from the 
8yearold conflict and iraq 19284 but un officials and 
diplomats in iran and iraq believe iran has 60000 to 70000 
prisoners and iraq 30000 to 50000 
mahallati was responding to a proposal iraq sent to the 
international committee of the red cross and to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar this week saying 
repatriation could begin on humanitarian grounds if iran 
reciprocated 
mahallati said medical examinations and registration of all 
prisoners could go forward he said tehran encourages the red cross 
to continue humanitarian exchanges which in the past have sent 
home sick and injured soldiers 
on our part we are ready to cooperate with the 
secretarygeneral and the icrc in order to do our best to 
repatriate unfortunate pows he said 
he said the red cross should encourage further exchanges of 
certain categories of prisoners 
but he said technical issues must be agreed upon such as the 
numbers of prisoners to be released their ranks whether prisoners 
who were detained the longest would be freed first the pace of 
releases and other questions 
he said these issues cannot be regarded outside resolution 
598 the un peace plan that is the basis for the peace talks 
iraq however said the releases would be on a humanitarian 
basis unrelated to the other issues referred to in security 
council resolution 598 
resolution 598 called for an immediate ceasefire withdrawal of 
troops to internationally recognized boundries and exchange of 
prisoners 
a unmediated ceasefire began aug 20 but peace talks have 
been deadlocked since just after they began aug 25 
the talks stalled over iraqi insistence the waterway forming 
their southern border be cleared of silt and sunken ships 
iraq calls the passage the shattalarab to iran it is the 
arvand river 
iran rejected the demand as a secondary issue that could be 
settled later and mahallati made clear wednesday that tehran wants 
withdrawal to the border to be the next step 
both sides have blamed each other for the stalemate in 
negotiations which perez de cuellar said he expects to resume next 
week in geneva

the former head of a suburban levee district 
discriminated against a woman employee by refusing to promote her 
even though she was best qualified for the job a federal appeals 
court has ruled 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals in a decision released 
late tuesday said the east jefferson levee district must pay sgt 
callie walsdorf as if she had received the promotion she was denied 
in april 1984 
john lauricella jr the former district president was heard 
to declare at the time he considered the candidates for the 
promotion aint no bitch gonna get this job the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals wrote 
there may exist a more unequivocal way to express an intent to 
exclude women from consideration for a promotion but none come 
readily to mind the court said 
lauricella did not return a telephone message left at his 
office he remains a member of the district which supervises and 
maintains the flood protection levees in western new orleans 
suburbs 
walsdorf whose discrimination claim had been rejected by a 
lower court also did not return a telephone message left at the 
district office 
levee board president greg gambel said wednesday that he did not 
know whether the board would appeal the ruling 
the federal appeals court declined to order walsdorfs promotion 
to assistant district superintendent the job in question because 
it would mean firing or demoting john t prados the man lauricella 
appointed 
it is undisputed that plaintiff was the most qualified 
applicant it is likewise undisputed that prados who was 
eventually appointed to fill the vacancy was unqualified at the 
time he applied the court said noting that prados was 
lauricellas lifelong friend 
the ruling said walsdorf later was rejected for promotion to 
lieutenant even though she had the highest score of all candidates 
on a competitive examination 
the court also lauricella retaliated against her in five 
separate incidents because she had filed charges with the equal 
employment opportunities commission and the state civil service 
commission 
those incidents included assigning her for six months to a job 
in which she did little but run errands and refusing to begin a 
meeting of district employees until she and the officer who 
testified about lauricellas discriminatory comment had left 
us magistrate ronald a fonseca found that lauricella had 
retaliated against walsdorf but awarded her only 1 in damages and 
cut her attorneys fees by 60 percent because he said she had not 
proved discrimination

groundlaunched cruise missiles targeted for destruction was 
dismantled at 545 pm cut apart by handheld saws and plasma arc 
torches at davismonthan air force base said air force spokesman 
capt chuck roque 
in addition 41 protective canisters for the mobile weapons and 
seven launch vehicles called transporter erector launchers had 
been halved he said only seven launchers were set for destruction 
during the current soviet elimination inspection 
as far as i can tell everybodys happy roque said things 
are progressing smoothly the soviets are seeing what they have to 
see im sure theyre pleased though i havent talked to them 
there doesnt seem to be any problem

72 hours after the 9 am tuesday arrival of 11 soviet inspectors 
the soviets departure for travis air force base in california 
from where they will return home is set for about noon thursday 
roque said 
under the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 443 air 
force landbased cruise missiles many of which have been deployed 
in europe are to be destroyed within the pacts first three years

nasa unleashed more than 100000 
horsepower wednesday in the first major firing of a large rocket 
engine at the marshall space flight center in almost 20 years 
singer john denver watched the 15second static firing with 
marshall director jr thompson and the several hundred other 
people and then commented with the technology behind that and 
the power it put out its spectacular 
the firing was held so that the national aeronautics and space 
administration could test new propulsion technology hardware and 
ideas applicable to liquid oxygenhydrogen engines officials said 
the engines should provide more reliability and lower costs for 
future space missions 
the 43 million engine positioned upright on a test stand 
burned 1400 gallons of liquid oxygen and 3800 gallons of 
hydrogen producing a huge ball of flame below the engine which 
turned into steam when it hit water in the cooling tank below 
a 45second test of the engine is scheduled sometime next month 
at the same test stand which cost close to 10 million in 
modifications for the current series of firings 
denver came to the space center as part of a threeday 
celebration of the recent successful firing of the discovery space 
shuttle he will be joined thursday and friday by the fiveman crew 
of discovery the nations first space shuttle mission in more than 
2 years 
the last large firing of a big rocket engine at marshall was a 
saturn test on feb 13 1969 in preparation for manned flights to

evidence about living american pows in vietnam and laos 
he said he and two fellow veterans will cross the mekong from 
thailand to laos early next month unless the laotian government 
frees two north carolina activists arrested oct 3 for illegal

science brought the shroud of turin into 
prominence and now science has shoved it back toward obscurity 
despite the turnabout the puzzling cloth doubtlessly will 
remain to many an object of fascination 
however results disclosed last week from radiocarbon tests show 
the shroud is only about 700 years old and could not be the burial 
cloth of jesus in the first century 
many had believed the cloth was the one used to wrap jesus body 
after his crucifixion and at the time of his resurrection a 
belief that had been strengthened by previous scientific findings 
but the latest tests at three separate laboratories in britain 
the us and switzerland using highly sensitive dating techniques 
find the shroud dated from between 1260 to 1390 
nevertheless the mystery of the image on the cloth remains it 
shows as in a photographic negative the front and back of a 
scourged crucified man scientists have been unable to determine 
how it got there 
a 32member us research team concluded in 1981 after spending 
five days subjecting the shroud to a wide range of tests that the 
image is not the product of an artist and that it bears blood 
stains 
but what caused the image is an ongoing mystery the report 
said 
that question also remained unanswered by the latest radiocarbon 
tests 
the rev adam otterbein head of the holy shroud guild says 
there are many other unresolved questions such as previous 
research claims that the image showed firstcentury coins over the 
victims eyes 
some scientists previously had suggested that the image was made 
by a sudden intense blaze of light such as that mentioned by 
scripture at the time of the resurrection 
others have theorized the image was caused by radiation or by 
some sort of still unexplained chemical reaction between body 
secretions and the cloth but that they have not been able to 
duplicate the effect by such processes 
the history of the 14by4footlong linen shroud can be traced 
to 1354 when it was deposited in lirey france by a french 
nobleman who participated in crusades to the holy land 
the cloth has been kept since 1578 in turin italy where the 
catholic archbishop of turin is its official guardian 
it drew little attention until scientific investigations of it 
began about the turn of the century starting with 1898 photographs 
revealing the image on the shroud had characteristics of a 
photographic negative 
since that time various studies accumulated so extensively that 
they took on a technical name siconology shroud study but 
testing of the cloth itself generally was not allowed since its 
keepers feared damage to it 
but that changed dramatically in 1978 when scientists of the u 
s shroud of turin research project were allowed to conduct various 
chemical photographic and computerized tests 
taking three years to correlate their results they concluded in 
1981 that the image of the crucified figure had not been forged by 
an artist but they were uncertain how it got there 
some team members said the accumulating evidence pointed to the 
shrouds authenticity including former team spokesman computer 
engineer kenneth stevenson and a theological consultant gary 
habermas 
in a book verdict on the shroud they said the converging 
evidence is not proof but it does show that the literal physical 
resurrection of jesus is the best explanation for peculiarities 
of the shroud 
they contended the most probable cause of the image was a heat 
and light scorch from some extraordinary phenomenon not part of 
natural processes other team members declined to draw such 
conclusions 
in 1986 pope john paul ii gave the goahead for the radiocarbon 
dating which was carried out independently on tiny bits of the 
shroud by the three separate institutions with the results 
considered 95 percent accurate 
all three institutions the university of arizona oxford 
university in england and the federal institute of technology in 
zurich dated the cloth in the middle ages 
i see no reason for the church to put these results in 
doubt cardinal anastasio ballestrero of turin told a news 
conference but he said the results do not close the book on the 
shroud 
this is but another chapter in the shrouds story or as some 
would say in the mystery of the shroud

reductions in diocesan services to parishes 
the bishop said the cutbacks however would not affect regular 
parish operations nor parish employees since parish budgets are 
administered independently he also said catholic community 
services catholic schools and cemeteries would be unaffected

the paris of the 1890s is highkicking its way 
across the london stage as a new production of cole porters 
cancan furthers britains love affair with the american 
musical 
you cant get better music than porter and you certainly 
cant get better lyrics than porter producer lovett bickford 
said of the show whose songs include cest magnifique 
allezvousen and i love paris 
he added in an interview that the musicals name was one of its 
primary virtues cancan refers to the spirited and rowdy dance 
women performed in paris nightspots involving high kicks and 
flirty exposures of lacy undergarments the musical takes place at 
the montmartre nightclub le bal du paradis presided over by the 
musicals heroine mme pistache 
the production budgeted at just under 17 million opens oct 
26 at the strand theater its one of a wave of american musicals 
to recently play the west end following kiss me kate annie 
get your gun south pacific and brigadoon 
donna mckechnie who originated the role of cassie in broadways 
a chorus line stars as the leggy pistache who is romantically 
pursued by the same judge who wants to close le bal du paradis for 
being immoral 
milo oshea and bernard alane head the supporting cast janie 
dee plays claudine the role that launched gwen verdon to stardom 
when cancan made its broadway bow in 1953 
david taylor directs with choreography by kenn oldfield 
the show was seen in london in 1954 and revived on broadway to 
mixed reviews in 1981 a road company version starring chita 
rivera and the rockettes from radio city music hall is currently 
touring the united states 
however bickford said his version was less a revival than a 
complete revision for all intents and purposes this is a new 
show he said 
he has hired lyricist julian more of irma la douce and 
expresso bongo fame to rewrite the book by the late abe 
burrows the musicals original director 
weve strengthened the romantic element lessened the 
comedy he said were trying to make a comment about hypocrisy 
moral hypocrisy sexual hypocrisy business hypocrisy that is 
as applicable today as it was in the 1890s 
mckechnie called the show a bittersweet love story with a 
happy ending naturally 
she was approached by bickford to do cancan when she was on 
tour in boston last year with the bob fosse musical sweet 
charity the 47yearold detroitborn performer said she had few 
qualms about inheriting a role often played by genuine frenchwomen 
shirley maclaine had the part in the 1960 movie which also starred 
maurice chevalier juliet prowse frank sinatra and louis jourdan 
we dont use the french accent we dont do allo allo 
she said its american but i say things with the lilt of a 
french feeling 
mckechnie made her broadway debut in 1961 as a dancer in abe 
burrows how to succeed in business without really trying she 
said she was pleased almost three decades later to be working 
again on one of his shows 
its another full circle she said i adored abe he was 
the first director that really encouraged me 
cancan marks her fourth appearance on the west end stage 
following runs in promises promises and company and a 
short engagement in 1977 in a chorus line 
the theater business is london and new york and were doing a 
lot of shows together she said londons like a second home to 
me its very close now 
the role itself also appeals to mckechnie who has been 
associated almost exclusively with a chorus line the 
longestrunning broadway show ever she originated the part of the 
anguished hoofer cassie and was briefly married to the shows 
directorchoreographer michael bennett who died last year of aids 
this is a very important part for me she said it opens a 
whole other genre of roles the kind i used to think of as a young 
dancer on broadway when id look up at the big stars hoping to 
grow into those roles if i can last

the case of five missing teenagers has 
baffled police for a decade and the trail has taken investigators 
through youth hostels branches of the military and even into the 
cult suicides by followers of jim jones in guyana 
but the search has been to no avail 
randy johnson melvin pittman alvin turner michael mcdowell 
and ernest taylor all 16 and 17yearolds from the newark area 
disappeared without a trace aug 20 1978 
don griffin associate director of the national network of 
runaway and youth services in washington said that he has never 
encountered a case like this one 
there are lots of instances where a group of young people will 
do something that will make them decide to take off he said 
but unless foul play came to them they usually come back at 
least one of them should have gotten homesick and called home 
the only real lead came a few days after they disappeared when a 
male voice on the telephone offered to tell sarah johnson the 
whereabouts of her son and his four missing friends in exchange for 
750 
the call was traced to a pay phone at union station in 
washington dc and police eventually decided it was made by the 
five boys who had run away from home and were trying to get some 
money 
but nobody has ever heard again from the five now grown to 
adulthood if they are alive 
we talked to police all over the country we checked with the 
military religious cults we even checked with federal agents 
about the bodies flown back from the jim jones suicides in 
guyana said detective everett hairston who has been on the case 
since the five were first reported missing 
now we just hope that someday someone will call about them 
he said 
the five all hung around together that summer and several of 
them had grown up in the same neighborhood hairston said he said 
they were basically good kids not rowdy and they had fairly 
stable home lives 
before mrs johnson and the families of the other four 
teenagers decided to stop granting interviews on the subject she 
said that the only thing that keeps me going is god almighty but 
every time i sit down for my dinner i get full thinking about my 
son and thinking maybe hes starving 
she said she especially misses him around 9 pm when i could 
always hear the basketball bouncing bouncing bouncing as he 
walked home from the park 
shooting baskets at west side park was the last place anyone saw 
all five of the boys together that day hairston said they finished 
playing about 4 pm and were picked up by lee anthony evans a 
handyman who often hired the teenagers to help him with odd jobs 
evans told police he dropped the boys off on a street corner 
near an ice cream parlor later that night michael mcdowell 
returned to his home in east orange and changed clothes hopping 
back into a waiting pickup truck with at least one other boy inside 
that was the last confirmed sighting of any of the five 
hairston said evans known to the teenagers as big man was 
exhaustively investigated we followed that guy for months gave 
him a lie detector test and he came up clean 
hairston said he has run through every hypothetical situation he 
could come up with if they had stolen a car and crashed into a 
river for instance the bodies would likely have been found by 
now if they had robbed a bank or ended up in prison there would 
have been a record 
the same applies for military enlistment hes checked with 
police in atlanta and chicago where mass murderers took young 
victims still no trace 
we have no physical evidence to suggest they are dead and so 
the case remains open hairston said 
his office has had little contact lately with the parents who 
have said they dont want to talk publicly about the case now 
i think the parents have continued with their lives 
hairston said but they still have a sense of hope

best known for growing tulips in the 
spring this dutch town soon may be famous for melting snow in the 
winter 
when the snow begins to fall and an average of 100 inches fall 
here each winter warm water from the citys power plant will be 
pumped through a grid of plastic pipes underneath downtown streets 
and sidewalks melting the snow and ice 
no longer will customers dread looking for parking spots between 
huge mounds of shoveled snow or risk slipping on icy patches as 
they window shop gone will be the days shopkeepers spend more time 
behind a shovel than a cash register 
the project called snowmelt is similar to systems used for 
decades in northern europe and scandinavian countries 
but the one being installed under streets and sidewalks along 
three downtown blocks here is the largest of its kind in the united 
states according to the systems engineers its expected to be 
completed in time for the first snowfall 
underground systems that use electricity or steam are being used 
on a smaller scale such as in driveways and parking lots of 
various us cities said pieter dekker project director for the 
citys board of public works 
a larger snowmelt system using water is being installed at a 
minneapolis mall to replace an aging underground heatingmat 
system but that wont be completed until 1991 
its designed so that the snow melts almost instantaneously as 
it hits the ground dekker said in theory there should never 
be an accumulation 
when the project was introduced earlier this year it was met 
with skepticism especially among downtown shopkeepers displeased 
with having to share its 11 million pricetag with the city 
but when local industrialist edgar prince who has a 
minisnowmelt system in his private driveway agreed to kick in 
250000 for the project and 25000 a year toward the annual 
100000 operating costs store owners warmed to the idea 
holland already had committed itself to a 2 million downtown 
beautification project that was going to demolish streets to put in 
new brick sidewalks landscaping and miniparks as well new utility 
and sewer lines 
the warm water to be used in system is a byproduct of the power 
plant which is less than a mile from downtown and is now dumping 
the water in lake macatawa 
the water will wind through the 58 twisted miles of plastic 
pipes at a constant temperature of 51 degrees yearround but may 
be turned up during heavy snowfalls 
already officials from other communities are visiting holland 
to find out more about the snowmelt system 
historically older downtowns die when shopping malls come in 
the core of the city becomes an eyesore of abandoned buildings 
said john hutchinson former chairman of the citys mainstreet 
committee the committee was formed three years ago when the city 
was designated a main street community by the national trust 
for historic preservation 
since then developers have taken advantage of lowinterest 
loans to renovate decaying facades of older buildings instead of 
tearing them down to build new ones 
were determined that holland mich is not going to follow 
that pattern said hutchinson an attorney whose wife owns a 
downtown childrens clothing shop 
while hollands attempts to revitalize its downtown and compete 
with suburban shopping malls are noteworthy a strong foundation 
already was in place 
the citys tulip festival draws hundreds of thousands of 
visitors each may its state park beach on lake michigan is 
considered michigans busiest and hollands dutch heritage 
reflected in wooden shoe shops and windmills has made it a 
popular stop for tourists 
most shopkeepers are enthusiastic about the snowmelt system 
even as construction temporarily deters customers 
but some arent so sure 
the problem is you wont see the pavement unless you go there 
and the people who dont like to go downtown wont go there in the 
middle of winter just because the snow melts said tim jenks a 
smallbusiness consultant and former mainstreet committee member 
still with proper promotion its novelty could make it a 
success he said i believe you can bring people downtown with a 
snowmelt system or with a threehumped camel its all a matter of 
how you promote it

doctors use such huge amounts of blood products 
despite criticism from the government and medical experts that 
some news reports call japan the vampire of the world 
its 122 million people consume up to onethird the worlds 
available supplies which makes enormous imports necessary 
critics say many patients are given blood products when other 
treatments would be both effective and cheaper 
the problem is that japan has been using too much serum 
albumin said masao nakashima chief of the health and welfare 
ministrys blood program 
serum albumin is a protein component of blood a low albumin 
level can be caused by burns or malfunctions of the liver and 
kidneys 
a governmentsponsored committee that investigated consumption 
of blood products two years ago said doctors often use the 
expensive products when medication is more appropriate 
the committee reported that albumin is often used as a 
nutrient although albumin is not effective for that purpose 
nakashima said his ministry has not issued guidelines limiting the 
use of blood products to certain symptoms 
toshiharu yamaguchi a surgeon at kyoto prefectural university 
of medicine gave another example to improve low protein in 
blood after an operation many doctors administer albumin although 
amino acid can be used instead 
its only japan that uses so much albumin he added i 
guess part of the reason is that the health insurance system here 
can offer it cheaper than abroad 
nearly all japanese belong either to private health plans that 
pay 90 percent of medical expenses for salaried workers or a 
government plan that pays 70 percent for the unemployed or 
selfemployed 
under the 90 percent formula treatment with blood products can 
cost the patient only 470 to 1000 yen about 4 to 8 
yamaguchi attributed the abuse to medical custom and inadequate 
government guidelines 
nakashima said in the end its all up to physicians 
decisions 
he said blood donations in japan meet the demand for wholeblood 
transfusions but about 90 percent of the products used are 
imported primarily from the the united states all imports since 
1985 have been heattreated to guard against aids and hepatitis 
to reach selfsufficiency nakashimas ministry has begun a 
campaign to reduce annual imports by march 1991 to 1 million 
liters or about 21 million pints from the current 56 million 
pints 
more donations may be hard to achieve because people began 
shunning donor buses and centers after the first case of acquired 
immune deficiency symdrome was identified in japan three years ago 
nakashima said some people think they can get aids for which no 
cure has been found by giving blood 
the japan red cross the only organization allowed to collect 
blood received 39 million pints from 82 million donors in 1987 
although the number of donors in japan is not any smaller than 
other countries most people donate only the minimum requirement of 
200cc 043 pint whereas the united states and european countries 
require more nakashima said 
end adv for monday oct 24

investors who ignored many dire warnings and 
stuck with socalled junk or high yield bond mutual funds 
have been rewarded for their faith so far this year 
as a group these funds have outperformed funds that concentrate 
on topquality corporate bonds or on government securities through 
a dicey period when many financial advisers were urging extreme 
caution 
for the nine months through sept 30 highyield funds averaged 
a total return yield plus change in net asset value of 96 
percent according to sheldon jacobs publisher of the advisory 
letter noload fund investor 
that compared with a return of 74 percent for funds confining 
themselves to investment grade bonds which are rated as much less 
prone to default and therefore substantially safer 
the junk bond funds recently were yielding 116 percent 
significantly higher than the 79 percent yield available on 
investmentgrade bond funds jacobs added 
if you had tried to tell many of the experts last winter that 
the results would turn out that way you probably would have found 
yourself in an argument 
the stock market crash last fall raised fears of an economic 
slump that would strain the ability of many companies with lower 
credit ratings to meet their obligations 
analysts pointed out that the junk bond market which has grown 
from about 60 billion to 180 billion just since the start of 
1985 had never been subjected to the acid test of a recession 
it still hasnt widespread fears that investors in the high 
yield market would suffer severe losses have been unfounded 
declares the alliance for capital access a group that represents 
many companies that have issued these bonds 
this year the market has significantly outperformed the 
treasury bond market the investmentgrade bond market and the 
stock market as it did in 1987 said david aylward the groups 
executive director 
does that mean that conservative investors who stick with 
governmentguaranteed bonds or bank certificates of deposit are 
missing a bet not necessarily says jacobs 
jacobs is well aware of studies finding that the extra yield 
investors get in a diversified portfolio of junk bonds more than 
compensates them over time for losses suffered when individual 
defaults occur 
risk as always has its reward he says people investing 
in lowerrated bonds receive greater rewards over the long run than 
investors selecting investmentquality bonds 
nevertheless a good investment over the long run is not 
necessarily a good investment in the immediate future 
for one thing he says figures compiled by the investment firm 
of salomon brothers show that the yield advantage offered by junk 
bonds over treasury bonds has narrowed of late to less than 3 
percentage points from nearly 4 points early this year 
experts in the field anticipate that the supply of new issues 
may soon increase he adds if that happens the shift in the 
supplydemand balance could exert downward pressure on junk bond 
prices 
in sum jacobs says we believe this is a time for 
caution while current economic data are strong recessions have a 
way of arriving unannounced and even conservatively positioned 
funds could have losses in that eventuality 
it seems certain that many financial advisers will remain 
skeptical about highyield bonds and funds until experience can 
show how they weather a period of economic decline 
a few scattered defaults would be no big problem for investors 
owning junk bond funds a more widespread credit crisis would be 
another matter entirely

a long journey from the four seasons to phoenix house 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for three decades the world of fastlane fancy 
restaurants was stuart levins oyster then multiple sclerosis 
struck taking the oyster but leaving a pearl levin discovered in 
himself and some young recovering drug addicts 
it took guts and insight and pain to find the gem 
a couple of years ago when his multiple sclerosis was at its 
worst levin sat in his apartment just sat day after day one 
morning as he watched some teenagers horsing around outside he 
said i thought about how far i had come and i said dammit i 
cant do nothing and i was doing nothing 
and he thought of the young people at phoenix house foundation 
levin once had helped a friend phoenix house president dr 
mitchell m rosenthal set up a dinner for donors to the drug 
treatment agency 
levin who had managed the four seasons one of manhattans 
plushest places to dine and catered to the kennedys among other 
things trained young people in rosenthals program as cooks bus 
boys and waiters for the night 
so now levin called on rosenthal 
i told him i cant walk and i cant run but i can talk and 
i can think maybe theres something i can do to further their 
lives 
and i was being selfish i needed them 
we all felt it was a wonderful opportunity to have a man of 
stuarts experience said rosenthal hes just a wonderful 
teacher 
levin and phoenix house officials settled on a restaurant 
service program which began just over a year ago with levin 
devoting one day a week to teaching recovering drug addicts skills 
they needed to work in restaurants skills that would enable them 
to earn a good living when they left phoenix house 
one day soon became five all volunteer and one program 
became two in one students at a phoenix house residential high 
school and treatment program learn cooking and other aspects of 
food service in the other which included opening a dining room 
with lunch service for employees at phoenix house headquarters 
people ages 21 to 26 learn dining room service 
but levin teaches more 
i teach a way of life what it is to have patience what it is 
to have understanding to share experiences for these young people 
to be part of our society they have to learn levin said 
no one had time for these kids when they were growing up i 
have time for them i have all the time in the world they are my 
life 
tony may who owns san domenico restaurant and hired one of 
levins students says the stuart levin ive seen recently is 
the same stuart levin i knew 20 years ago his enthusiasm the 
way he moves the way he pushes hes the same man to me 
hes a different kind of person a man who came from the 
top said student gameal abdo 22 he teaches the right way 
how its supposed to be done out in the real world 
we love him for someone to put themselves out for kids like 
us said jeffrey mcgee 19 
a lot of people might feel the same way but he shows it 
adds andrew galloway 20 
weve had our trials and tribulations on the street but weve 
come a long way and for him to see us as people that counts 
said lorraine johnson 19 
levin 58 teaches what he knows best what he learned over 35 
years 
besides being the first resident manager at the four seasons he 
was president of le pavillon now closed but once considered among 
the countrys best restaurants and he opened the top of the park 
high above central park 
a stuart levin day was once proclaimed in new york city 
the mementos of that life take up five walls of levins 
apartment mixed in with certificates of appreciation photographs 
with famous people and awards are pictures of his two children and 
their children his parents himself as a child 
the mementos of his new life are on the coffee table a poem a 
letter and a card from students 
of his old life he says i dont miss it i think about it 
but i dont miss it because my life is so full 
its like a tree im the main stalk and my life was one 
branch out here he said stretching out his left arm it fell 
off so im starting a new life a new branch over here 
he almost didnt give the new branch a chance to grow 
there had been signs of weakness and trouble walking but levin 
said his doctor could not find the cause then one morning in june 
1985 levin woke up and could not move his right side he soon 
learned he had ms 
i wanted it to be fatal i wanted to end it all why me 
multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system 
that afflicts an estimated 250000 americans the cause is not 
known nor is the cure though some treatments are available 
symptoms vary greatly from person to person and range from blurred 
vision to paralysis to confusion it is not contagious and is 
rarely fatal 
after levins diagnosis his doctor sent him to a rehabilitation 
center and levin became determined to walk again and without leg 
braces we tried i couldnt walk i broke down in hysterics for 
one day then he put on the brace and now he walks with a 
walker he also sometimes uses a wheelchair 
my most difficult thing is putting on my shoes in the 
morning he said pointing at black laceup shoes i scream at 
myself come on stuart and then i get dressed and start my 
day

one recent day that meant first fixing a breakfast of coffee 
my own special blend and cake for three guests 
he greets his company looking sophisticated dapper in a blue 
blazer with gold buttons striped shirt and gray flannel slacks a 
gold bracelet on one wrist a gold watch on the other 
i eat in restaurants go to museums theater i do everything 
but i had to build up confidence in myself he said youve got 
to get on in this world and do the most you can thats what its 
all about what its really all about 
but when i do go out i think out every detail of the day and 
allow for any mishaps first off i have to think where are the 
bathrooms 
just leaving his apartment building demands patience and 
perseverance 
he goes down a floor in the elevator but still must negotiate a 
set of two steps and a set of three before he reaches the sidewalk 
then theres getting in the car the hired driver folding up the 
walker and stashing it in the trunk 
the process is repeated in reverse upon arrival fewer than 10 
blocks away a short drive but a long way from central park west 
to the headquarters of phoenix house foundation 
levin is greeted by his students like a returning hero but he 
quickly settles them back to work 
at the entrance to the dining room two young people stand 
straight dressed in uniform black pants or skirt pressed white 
shirt a folded restaurant apron at the waist waiters pads and 
pens in their waistbands 
tables are set for a feast two forks two spoons just so on 
the edge of the table even though some of the phoenix house 
employees dining there are having hot dogs 
the food may be rather modest its not lutece fare but the 
kids serve it as if it were said arlene spiller assistant 
director of public information at the foundation levin is 
demanding and exacting before any platter is served he inspects 
it he corrects every little thing 
its ronnie greins second day in the course im like really 
nervous but mr levin is making it comfortable for me to learn 
said grein who came to phoenix house four months ago as a 
condition of probation 
grein and levin hit it off immediately 
i took his hands and i said i love you i love you for being 
here levin recalled the next day was greins 22nd birthday and 
levin brought a card 
i dont think anyone ever gave him a birthday card before 
levin said breaking into tears he was so empty 
about 60 young people have taken part in levins programs he 
lists his successes the students and the restaurants where they 
work his friends in the industry donate food give lectures even 
invite students into their professional kitchens 
no question about it in time these young people will have 
their own businesses said levin fairly bursting with pride 
the culinary arts program is part of phoenix academy a 
residential high school phoenix house runs with the board of 
education 
students learn menu planning and writing setting a formal 
table cooking service once a week they begin the day with a 
lecture from levin and end with the meal they prepared usually for 
12 to 15 people including guests after 10 weeks theres a test 
meal and then levin takes the class to lunch at a tablecloth 
restaurant 
students agree levin is strict no eating while cooking clean 
as you go follow directions presentation counts as well as taste 
and they agree he teaches more than fine dining things like 
patience consistency respect 
these kids are so stupendous said levin they have a lust 
for learning they want to know they want to learn they want to 
be theyre just like me 
that sameness is not always apparent 
gameal abdo for example started using drugs at 13 went to six 
junior high schools eight boys homes even jail before he came to 
phoenix house in april 1986 
levin grew up in a nice part of queens served in the korean war 
and went to the university of wyoming he lives in a spacious 
apartment overlooking central park there are picasso prints on his 
walls and famous names in his telephone directory 
but make no mistake abdo and levin both touched bottom and 
learned a new way to live 
at 22 abdo just landed a fulltime job in tony mays restaurant 
as a prep cook and hell move to a transitional house while he 
saves enough to rent his own apartment he hopes to open his own 
restaurant one day 
and these days levin is on top of the world im not a 
president or a king but i sure feel like one

there are no dangling icicles in clark hall 
no frost on the walls and breathing doesnt produce vapor clouds 
but its still one of the coldest known spots in the universe 
it doesnt look very impressive but we are going to go a 
million times colder than the coldest natural place we know of 
says robert c richardson head of the lowtemperature physics 
group at cornell universitys microkelvin laboratory 
richardson and his colleagues using a 15 million 
superrefrigeration unit will try to achieve absolute zero the 
temperature at which even atoms stop rubbing together and creating 
heat 
we think we can take it down to between 1 and 10 
microkelvin he said and each step of the way we could be 
finding new effects 
the only other us deepfreeze laboratory is under construction 
at the university of florida labs in japan and england have hit 12 
microkelvin 
how cold is that 
thats 12 millionths of a degree above absolute zero which is 
zero on the kelvin temperature scale or minus 459 degrees 
fahrenheit 
the researchers arent simply out to break records though 
the importance of this type of research lies in realizing the 
strange things that happen at low temperatures said william 
oosterhuis section head of the condensed matter sciences unit at 
the national science foundation one just never knows whats 
going to happen this research provides us with a probe into an 
area where weve never been before 
among the strange discoveries of extremely lowtemperature 
research has been superconductivity electricity with no loss to 
resistance at 4 kelvin 
sometimes it is the arithmetic or the theory behind the 
research that has the practical application said donald h 
liebenberg who helped the lab get nsf funding before he left in 
april for the office of naval research 
sometimes the technology produced has broader applications in 
other fields the most important aspect though is that these 
facilities will be breeding grounds of technological spinoffs for 
future low temperature research liebenberg said 
individual scientists have conducted low temperature research 
before but the lack of a permanent facility to maintain such 
temperatures indefinitely and allow for varied experiments has been 
an obstacle richardson said now we have an adequate tool to 
find or at least search properly for the answers to all the 
open questions that remain in front of us 
the rooms adjoining cornells 2800squarefoot underground 
laboratory are designed to eliminate all stray heat including that 
produced from the most minute vibrations and from radiofrequency 
electrical signals 
to that end they are lined with butcher block wood and 
galvanized electromagnetic shielding and have specially grounded 
electrical wiring and incandescent lighting the low temperature 
instruments are secured by concrete sewer pipes filled with sand 
the supercooling machines themselves are rigid aluminum filled 
with liquid helium copper and superconducting magnets the 
apparatus stands 12 feet tall and weighs about 700 pounds but the 
focus is on a 36inch vacuum cylinder 
to reach microkelvin temperatures a process that takes about 
two weeks scientists first polarize copper with a superconducting 
magnet then cool it to around 10 millikelvin in the refrigerator 
which uses liquid helium rather than freon gas for cooling once 
the copper is at 10 millikelvin the magnetic field is reduced and 
the copper nuclei which are now aligned and highly ordered take 
over further cooling everything in the surrounding medium 
we can never be sure what will be found said richardson 
maybe well have the good fortune to stumble upon a new science

sayra lebenthal remembers the 1929 stock market 
crash almost as if it happened yesterday her baby nurse had the 
day off so she had to put off selling bonds at the family 
securities firm to take care of her two small children 
mrs lebenthal made it into work during last years crash only 
this time her son james was selling bonds beside her and 
daughter eleanor was home after just retiring from the family 
business 
on monday two days before the anniversary of the oct 19 1987 
crash wall streets grand dame celebrated her 90th birthday with 
throngs of visiting clients coworkers and friends 
im not used to all this attention im not used to these 
flowers and plants im just a hardworking lady who sells bonds 
all day long said mrs lebenthal who has served as treasurer of 
municipal bond broker lebenthal amp co for the past 63 years 
her son james now runs the new yorkbased firm but mrs 
lebenthal still keeps regular hours at the business that she and 
her husband louis lebenthal started back in 1925 with just a few 
dollars the company has since grown into one of the largest 
municipal bond dealers in the country 
municipal bonds which are exempt from federal income taxes are 
debt securities issued by cities counties or states to finance a 
variety of projects 
it took years and years to build up mrs lebenthal said in 
a recent interview about her business we started with an idea 
we had no money we had secondhand furniture in a small office 
the only thing that was new was the secretary 
mrs lebenthal learned the business on her own and from her 
husband at a time when few women especially those with young 
children were working on wall street she held the company 
together after a succession of strokes felled her husband in 1951 
passing along her knowledge to her two children 
mother was one smart cookie said james lebenthal lebenthal 
amp cos chairman 
there were very few women when i started here but i 
wouldnt play up the fact that im a woman mrs lebenthal said 
in a stern voice 
for mrs lebenthal a fiesty welldressed greatgrandmother who 
holds a law degree from the university of syracuse the day begins 
shortly after sunrise 
she sometimes makes a trip to the beauty parlor then heads to 
her wall street offices by 830 am where she spends most of her 
time on the telephone trying to match bonds with clients quitting 
time is usually eight or nine hours later 
i really cater to them she said of the hundreds of clients 
she has amassed over the years theres a lot of sentiment 
attached to the years i spent with my clients 
i take from them mans greatest possession money if you make 
money youre doing good 
mrs lebenthal does most of her work the old fashioned way 
without computers behind her desk and undernearth pictures of 
assorted grandchildren and greatgrandchildren are about three 
dozen binders listing her clients in alphabetical order 
i start with the as on one day and the zs the next 
sometimes i miss the os or ps she said 
mrs lebenthal said that neither stock market crash particularly 
fazed her especially having lived through the great depression 
about a dozens recessions and new york citys fiscal crisis in the 
mid1970s 
she said business picked up after both stock crashes as 
investors looked to the bond market as a safer haven for their 
money she describes most of her clients as conservative investors 
who dont know what to do with their money 
the stock market isnt the be all to end all she said i 
wasnt sitting here crying my market became very strong 
mrs lebenthal said her husband had predicted the 1929 stock 
market crash and had even made bets with several colleagues 
he had won a lot of bets did they make good on them not 
one

cigarette profits are the driving power behind 
philip morris companies inc but the maker of marlboro and 
virginia slims sees cheese in its future 
philip morriss 11 billion cash bid for kraft inc which 
formally began tuesday would give it control of a company that has 
a 26 percent wedge of the us market for natural cheese and 60 
percent of the processed cheese market according to market 
researcher findsvp 
buying kraft would make philip morris the undisputed king of the 
supermarket aisles with products ranging from miller lite and 
jello to such noncheese kraft brands as miracle whip sealtest 
and breyers ice cream celestial seasonings tea and lenders 
bagels 
even after swallowing glenview illbased kraft though new 
yorkbased philip morris would lean heavily on cigarettes 
philip morris currently gets 52 percent of its revenue and 77 
percent of its operating profit from its tobacco business 
according to mary english an analyst for the furman selz 
investment firm 
including kraft 40 percent of philip morriss revenue and 65 
percent of operating income would come from tobacco she said 
krafts stock shot up 2812 a share to 8825 on tuesday just 
under the 90ashare offer but philip morris stock fell 450 a 
share to 9550 reflecting investors worries that the expense of 
the acquisition would hurt the companys profits trading was 
extremely heavy in both stocks 
separately a report published today said buyout specialist 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co is interested in kraft and might be 
posturing to rescue the company from philip morris 
according to unidentified sources quoted in todays editions of 
the new york times the buyout firm either has or is planning to 
volunteer its services to kraft management 
the aggressive new york firm with a 56 billion investment 
pool that can leverage many times that amount is financially 
capable of competing against philip morris the sources said 
it is the immense profitability of cigarettes that gives philip 
morris the muscle to bid for kraft in a deal that would give the 
company more control of supermarket shelf space and an entree to 
the important european market 
the purchase becomes especially important in light of the recent 
523 billion bid by britains grand metropolitan plc for pillsbury 
co pillsburys directors urged stockholders to reject the offer 
tuesday 
in another deal holly farms inc on tuesday rejected an 891 
million purchase offer from tyson foods inc that would have united 
two of the nations largest poultry processors 
if successful the bids would accelerate a trend in which the 
food business is being concentrated in the hands of a few giant 
multinational companies 
philip morris contends the purchase of kraft would not raise 
antitrust concerns because kraft and philip morriss general foods 
corp make different kinds of food 
analysts said the two companies combined would be able to make 
more effective use of techniques such as cooperative advertising 
with supermarkets in order to increase their allimportant share of 
shelf space 
kraft and general foods also could share trucks warehouses and 
sales representatives meanwhile krafts presence overseas could 
help get general foods brands distributed abroad 
these american companies have got to get bigger and strong 
before the other guys do so they can compete headtohead with the 
european conglomerates miss english said 
contrary to the impression given by the backlash against smoking 
in the united states tobacco is not a dying industry american 
companies are selling cigarettes effectively abroad and the global 
industry is growing 15 percent to 2 percent a year she said 
but the impression that tobacco is a languishing market has kept 
philip morriss stock lower than it otherwise might be hamish 
maxwell philip morriss chairman and chief executive said in an 
interview monday night 
philip morris expects to generate 11 billion to 12 billion in 
excess cash over the next five years which would be used to pay 
for the deal 
in a sign of its financial strength the company said tuesday it 
intended to pay for the deal up front by borrowing entirely from 
commercial banks rather than by selling debt securities to the 
public 
the excess cash is what philip morris will have left over after 
taking care of dividend payouts and what it believes are its needs 
for internal reinvestment philip morris already has 
stateoftheart plants that churn out cigarettes far more cheaply 
than they can be produced by lowcost labor in less developed 
nations 
in the past the companys excess cash has gone into increased 
dividends and share buybacks which directly benefit shareholders 
but even after that there is money left over

federal prosecutors officially notified drexel 
burnham lambert inc that it is targeted in a criminal grand jury 
probe raising the prospect that the investment giant will be 
indicted 
drexel which claims it is innocent of any wrongdoing repeated 
that assertion tuesday in disclosing receipt of a socalled 
target letter from the manhattan us attorneys office 
the disclosure came a month after drexel one of the biggest 
wall street firms was accused by the securities and exchange 
commission of extensive securities fraud in an alleged conspiracy 
involving four key employees and nowimprisoned insider trader ivan 
f boesky 
although it has been widely known for months that a grand jury 
has been probing drexels activities formal notification often is 
seen as a strong signal that prosecutors believe they have enough 
evidence to bring charges 
bruce baird the assistant us attorney in charge of securities 
fraud cases was out of the office and unavailable for comment an 
aide said office spokeswoman deborah corley said she could not 
comment 
the us attorney has advised drexel burnham by letter that it 
is a target of a grand jury investigation looking into alleged 
violations of the federal criminal laws the firm said in a 
statement 
according to the staff of the us attorney no determination 
has been made by the us attorney to seek an indictment drexel 
burnham believes that any such indictment would be unwarranted and 
unfair 
drexel a pioneer in the junk bond highyield debt market 
has been under intense scrutiny by both the us attorneys office 
and the sec because of disclosures by boesky who once had 
extensive dealings with the firm and who settled insider trading 
charges two years ago by paying a 100 million fine 
in exchange for his cooperation in implicating others boesky 
was allowed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge conspiracy 
to lie to the sec 
on sept 7 the sec filed a longawaited civil complaint alleging 
drexel its highyield bond financier michael milken and others 
schemed with boesky to profit on inside information cheat drexel 
clients hide stock in each others names to avoid reporting 
requirements and commit other frauds 
drexel milken and the other defendants denied those 
accusations if a grand jury were to indict them the sec suit 
likely would be delayed by the more serious criminal charges 
the sec suit already has been delayed by pretrial haggling over 
evidence gathering and the impartiality of the federal judge 
presiding over the case milton pollack 
on monday pollack rejected defense attorney requests that he 
disqualify himself calling their arguments unfounded the defense 
has vowed to appeal his ruling

pillsbury cos doughboy isnt being shy 
about the companys rejection of a 523 billion unsolicited 
takeover by britains grand metropolitan plc 
a day after pillsbury urged shareholders to turn down grand 
mets 60ashare tender offer a snarling doughboy sporting boxing 
gloves and rolledup sleeves appeared today in fullpage newspaper 
ads designed to convince shareholders the company is serious about 
remaining independent 
in selected newspapers around the country pillsburys 
oncejovial mascot appeared under the headline grand met must 
have had one too many if they thought we wouldnt put up a fight 
pillsbury said it is not going to sit idly by while an 
opportunistic british liquor and gambling company takes advantage 
of a weak us dollar and tries to buy respectability with the 
purchase of a classic american company 
on tuesday grand met continued to press for a friendly deal 
but pillsbury chairman philip l smith stressed that now is not the 
time to sell greater values are available to the shareholders in 
the long term 
the options could include a special dividend to shareholders 
the selling of some of the companys businesses in a financial 
restructuring a leveraged buyout or the sale of an equity 
interest to a third party smith said 
there are options that include not putting the company up for 
sale smith said 
he said the companys directors will decide on an alternative 
before shareholders are required to decide whether to tender their 
shares grand mets offer expires nov 1 but could be extended 
ian a martin chief executive of us operations for grand met 
said he was surprised pillsburys board concluded the allcash 
offer was inadequate 
our price represents more than 50 percent over the pillsbury 
market price prior to the announcement of our offer martin said 
we doubt that pillsbury stockholders will agree with their 
boards conclusion 
pillsburys stock rose 37 cents a share to 59 a share in 
consolidated trading on the new york stock exchange tuesday 
grand met spokesman walter montgomery said smith was vague in 
explaining why pillsbury shareholders should hold on to their stock 
the companys eagerly awaited but unsatisfactory response to 
this generous offer exhibits the same indecisiveness that has 
prevented pillsbury from taking advantage of its many previous 
oportunities to produce value for its shareholders montgomery 
said 
asked what direction the board was leaning in chosing an 
alternative to accepting the offer smith said there really 
isnt at this particular time any real favorite 
smith said the pillsbury board rejected the offer after deciding 
that significant investments have been made to improve slumping 
burger king operations and the fullservice restaurant chain of 
steak amp ale 
grand met has said it would sell pillsburys fullservice 
restaurants to comply with laws that forbid liquor distillers from 
selling liquor at retail outlets but it has said it would retain 
burger king and other core businesses the british company also has 
said it would cut some senior management jobs at pillsbury if the 
bid is successful 
pillsbury is suing grand met in 14 states on grounds that the 
takeover would violate the socalled tiedhouse liquor 
statutes additional legal action was taken tuesday with a lawsuit 
filed in washington dc alleging that grand mets tender offer 
violates a section of the 1916 shipping act 
according to the suit it would be illegal for pillsbury to 
transfer ownership of its tpc transportation co to grand met 
because it is a foreign company such a transfer requires the 
approval of the us secretary of transportation according to the 
lawsuit tpc is a water carrier operating towboats and barges 
pillsbury said 
montgomery said grand met lawyers have said the proposed 
takeover would not violate the shipping act

president miguel de la madrid boasted of his 
governments efforts to reduce its role in the economy and declared 
that the era of state economic interventionism was over in mexico 
meanwhile new government figures released tuesday confirmed a 
dramatic shrinkage in mexicos trade surplus with oil revenues 
sinking and imports skyrocketing by more than 50 percent above 
their 1987 level 
de la madrid whose sixyear term ends nov 30 cited reductions 
in government spending a tighter rein on public accounts and the 
liquidation of unprofitable staterun enterprises under his tenure 
in a meeting with commerce department officials on tuesday 
without bragging i can affirm that there is no other 
government in the world that has accomplished a rationalization of 
its administrative apparatus with the rapidity that we mexicans 
have he said 
de la madrid ordered more than 250 million in budget cuts this 
month after prices for oil a staple mexican export dropped to 
record lows 
the cuts were linked to an agreement with the us treasury 
department and federal reserve that permits mexico to draw up to 
35 billion in bridge loans until the government reaches new loan 
agreements with the world bank and possibly other multilateral 
agencies 
a world bank mission is visiting mexico city to discuss with 
mexican officials possible arrangements for new longterm financing 
in announcing the loan package on monday the treasury 
department said it was intended to support mexicos budgetcutting 
and antiinflation programs by cushioning the impact of the oil 
price plunge which will cost mexico billions of dollars in 
anticipated revenues this year 
de la madrid also cited mexicos accession in 1986 to the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade under which the government 
has dismantled a decadesold import substitution policy and opened 
up the economy to foreign imports 
mexico now has a full role in largescale trade negotiations 
that are taking place in the world had we stayed at the margin of 
a badly understood nationalism the country today would have been 
gravely damaged the president said 
mexicos trade surplus for the first eight months of the year 
slipped to 25 billion well below the 6 billion surplus 
registered between january and august of 1987 the governmentrun 
national statistics institute reported tuesday 
exports reached 142 billion during the januaryaugust period 
with nonoil goods at 94 billion well outpacing petroleum 
exports at 47 billion in 1987 crude oil and petroleumderived 
exports totalled 58 billion 
oil accounted for 296 percent of total export revenues in 1988 
compared to 393 percent for the eightmonth period in 1987 
imports between january and august surged to 117 billion or 
53 percent more than last years 76 billion figure the institute 
said 
capital goods imports worth 82 billion accounted for the bulk 
of the increase rising 57 percent over the same eightmonth period 
in 1987 the institute attributed the rise to greater demand for 
manufactures inputs by a healthier industrial sector 
the institute said imports of consumer goods jumped by 1334 
percent to just over 1 billion 
de la madrids administration paved the way for the import surge 
by reducing tariffs abolishing official prices for imports and 
eliminating a prior import permit requirement for most products 
the maximum import tariff which once stood at 40 percent now 
is 20 percent most tariffs currently in effect are below that 
figure

pillsbury co may be forced to sell its burger king 
fastfood chain to fend off an unwanted 523 billion takeover bid 
from the british conglomerate grand metropolitan plc analysts say 
pillsburys board unanimously rejected grand mets 60ashare 
offer tuesday calling it inadequate and not in the best 
interests of the company and its shareholders 
minneapolisbased pillsbury said it would consider other 
alternatives including selling the company to a third party 
restructuring pillsburys finances by selling some businesses 
speculation of an possible burger king sale was fueled tuesday 
by the resignation of burger king president charles s olcutt 
appointed burger king chairman was jerry w levin a pillsbury 
executive vice president known for his work on mergers and 
acquisitions 
the guys good at doing deals john mcmillin an analyst 
with prudentialbache securities inc in new york said of levin 
ive got to think hes been brought in to do a deal 
analysts speculated that the sale of the miamibased restaurant 
chain could bring pillsbury as much as 2 billion 
burger king accounts for about onethird of pillsburys sales 
and about twothirds of its profits but has not done well recently 
the company reported its pretax profits have declined more than 50 
percent to 482 million in the fiscal year ended may 31 from 
1192 million in fiscal 1986 
william maguire an analyst with merrill lynch amp co in new 
york said olcott who quit after just over two years in the post 
wasnt a marketing man when they needed a marketing man badly 
during olcotts administration the company ran an expensive but 
disappointing advertising campaign touting its hamburgers based on 
the slogan we do it like youd do it

at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 145 million units last 
month up 22000 units or 15 percent from august when housing 
starts fell a sharp 31 percent 
analysts had been expecting a modest recovery in housing starts 
for last month because fixedrate mortgages retreated a bit after 
rising steadily from late march through midaugust when they 
peaked for the year so far at 1071 percent 
last week according to the federal home loan mortgage co

the oct 19 market crash last year

is responsible for boom times at the nations factories 
in a review of the economy based on reports from its 12 regional 
banks the fed said all areas of the nations industrial sector 
show signs of strength and expansion including chemicals paper 
and pulp steel autos and trucks and machinery 
economists noted the drop in the value of the dollar over the 
last three years has made us goods less expensive on overseas 
markets and has fueled a boom in export sales this year 
in another report the commerce department said that income 
growth in the rust belt is staging a comeback after trailing 
the national average for most of the decade 
in its report on nonfarm personal income the commerce 
department said that states bordering the pacific and atlantic 
coasts continue to have generally better income growth than the 
states in between but the gap in the growth rates is narrowing 
the government attributed gains in the great lakes states to 
strength in the manufacturing of durable goods big ticket 
items expected to last three or more years and in construction it 
said the midatlantic region also benefited from a pickup in 
manufacturing

the forecasts this year are indeed very positive the eec 
commission said in a report to the 12 eec states

the department of transportation will 
reconsider its award to continental airlines of the seattletokyo 
air route once given to rival united airlines 
the announcement tuesday postponed for another month a decision 
in a twoyear battle over a route worth more than 100 million in 
revenue annually 
both united and american airlines had asked for the review 
claiming they were more qualified and competent to fly the route 
than continental 
although this does not represent a final decision we are 
confident that the clear merits of our case will speak for 
themselves in an objective review by the department said chuck 
novak a spokesman for chicagobased united 
in a fivepage order the department said that despite a federal 
appeals decision ordering that houstonbased continental be awarded 
the route it had decided to take another look at the case 
the department clearly has the authority to reconsider its own 
decision the order said reconsideration of a final agency 
decision is inherent in the agencys power to decide 
the order said that united and american had raised questions as 
to whether an administrative law judge in initially awarding the 
route to continental had failed to properly consider the 
departments criteria for selecting a carrier for the route 
we agree with this argument the order said 
the administrative law judges decision was the basis for the 
appeals court decision ordering the department to give the route to 
continental 
the review will be conducted by a senior department official and 
a decision is due no later than nov 21 the department refused to 
reopen the hearing record 
tuesdays decision was the latest twist in the hotlycontested 
fight over the route which at various times has been awarded to 
all three airlines by different administrative law judges and 
department officials 
its absolutely good news steve mcgregor an american 
spokesman in dallas said of the departments decision to 
reconsider the appeals court decision was based on procedural 
grounds and we would hate to see such an important route be awarded 
on such a basis 
the seattletokyo route had previously been flown by pan 
american world airways but united assumed the route temporarily 
when it purchased pan am corps pacific division in 1986 
the department approved the purchase but only on the condition 
that the seattletokyo route be dealt with separately 
united has warned that it would be forced to cancel its 
seattlehong kong route and lay off many of its 2500 workers at 
seattletacoma international airport unless it was allowed to 
continue flying the tokyo route 
a 20 million expansion of united facilities at the airport was 
put on hold pending a decision 
american airlines officials have said their airline was prepared 
to build a new 100 million to 150 million hub at the 
seattletacoma airport if it received the route

twelve members of congress today asked 
president reagan not to permit production of nuclear weapons 
material to resume without a certification to congress that it can 
be done safely 
were trying to change the debate of the past two weeks to 
get away from fingerpointing and address institutional and 
policy problems said one of the organizers of the letter rep 
mike synar dokla chairman of the environment subcommittee of 
the house goverment operations committee 
the energy department is not in control of its own plants it 
is the captive of its contractors was how synar decribed the 
chief problem 
the letter was released shortly after energy secretary john 
herrington told television interviewers that safety standards at 
the nations aging nuclear weapons plants have been adequate but 
are not acceptable under modern standards 
herrington interviewed on nbctvs today show said the 
energy department has doubled its cleanup budget to 15 billion a 
year and plans further increases 
he said in another interview on cbs this morning that 
cleaning up will cost 100 billion to 150 billion which is close 
to the estimate of a congressional study released earlier this 
month the general accounting office according to synar has put 
the cost at 150 billiont to 175 billion over the next 20 to 30 
years 
the department has shut down all of its facilities producing 
plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons because of safety 
problems herrington announced last week that one of three 
tritiumproducing reactors at the savannah river plant near aiken 
sc would be restarted by january 
three environmental groups however threatened today to seek a 
court injunction to stop the reopening unless herrington prepares 
an environmental impact statement first those statements can take 
a year or two to prepare 
the letter to reagan asked that he require the department to 
develop within 90 days a plan which will put the department 
back in control of its facilities establish clear lines of 
authority and communication and firmly identify who is 
responsible 
it also asked that no reactor be restarted until the 
departments new advisory committee on nuclear facility safety 
certifies to both congress and the department that public health 
and safety will be adequately protected during reactor operations 
synar said the group had no objection to contractors operating 
government weapons plants as long as they were properly supervised 
sen john glenn dohio a longtime critic of the deparments 
operations and a signer of the letter said he thought a restart 
could be accomplished reasonably soon but not within 90 days 
spokesmen at the energy department who could comment on the 
letter were not available 
in addition to synar and glenn the letter was signed by house 
democratic committee chairmen jack brooks of texas government 
operations mo udall of arizona interior john dingell of 
michigan energy and commerce and house democrats phil sharp of 
indiana dave mccurdy of oklahoma david e skaggs of colorado 
albert bustamente of texas and norman dicks of washington and 
republicans frank horton of new york and william f clinger of 
pennsylvania 
the department stopped the only operating reactor at savannah 
river in augst after the plant operator du pont co ignored an 
unexplained power surge during startup 
the government also has closed its rocky flats plutonium 
production plant at golden colo after three workers were exposed 
to radiation last month herrington said there is no shortage of 
plutonium but tritium deteriorates and supplies need to be replaced 
the plants were built in the 1950s and energy officials have 
said they will have to be used for another decade even though the 
normal life of a nuclear plant is 25 years 
there has been a good margin of safety its been adequate 
herrington told cbs but he said it was not acceptable under 
standards for the future 
he noted that no one had been killed or hurt as a result of 30 
major mishaps reported at the savannah river plant or incidents at 
other weapons facilities 
but i think that margin of safety has to be widened and 
thats what youre seeing today herrington said 
he said none of the problems at the savannah river plant 
approached a meltdown which could have endangered the public and 
no commercial power plant has been affected by the safety problems 
herrington said in the nbc interview that the department plans 
to release a report ranking nuclear production sites and saying 
what is wrong with each one and what needs to be done to clean up 
and modernize 
its the right way to do business today and we are turning 
this giant industrial complex in a good way in my estimation he 
said

airline executives whove faced him across a 
bargaining table and union militants whove stood with him in 
picket lines use the same word to describe teamsters leader william 
f genoese feisty 
some call him downright ornery not a few detractors portray him 
as a firebreathing dragon who is big on threats but short on 
delivering tangible benefits to his rank and file 
genoese 62 the director of the teamsters unions airline 
division is an oldstyle labor leader and a perpetual thorn in the 
side of big carriers like pan am corp 
shy and retiring hes not im known to be able to steal the 
socks off your feet with your shoes still on em genoese said in 
a recent interview vaunting his reputed prowess in negotiating 
with company officials 
we call him the magician said joe konowe director of the 
unions industrial trades division who was an assistant to former 
teamsters boss jimmy hoffa in the 1950s and 60s 
genoese represents around 40000 teamsters union employees at 
several major airlines notably pan am northwest airlines usair 
group inc and braniff inc not all big airlines have a teamsters 
local the union also recently won representation at privately 
owned united parcel service which operates a fleet of around 250 
planes as part of its delivery network 
the airline teamsters include passenger service cargo and 
reservations agents baggage handlers clerical workers and nurses 
unlike pilots and flight engineers they can be fairly easily 
replaced by airlines in labor disputes but they can disrupt a 
carriers operations if they strike 
together teamsters employees at the airlines provide genoese 
with a war chest of around 300000 a year in union dues 
genoeses biggest battle is at pan am the beleaguered airline 
which lost 884 million in the first half of this year imposed 
35 million in pay cuts on its 4200 teamsters under federal labor 
rules after they rejected a new costcutting contract last february 
genoese has threatened to call the teamsters out on strike 
against pan am under the same rules but so far hasnt done so 
when the unions strike deadline passed in february he vowed 
guerrilla warfare against pan am including deliberate 
diversion of baggage and cargo and cancellation of passengers 
reservations 
its that kind of behavior that has sparked tough criticism of 
the teamsters leader 
i dont like the way genoese is playing said a pan am union 
member who spoke on condition of anonymity the tactics that 
genoese is using now are the tactics of the past 
genoese doesnt see it that way any company of any size can 
beat any union unless the union is on top of it and knows how to 
muster its strength he said in the interview in his manhattan 
office 
a visit to the sprawling union office with its staff of 25 
including genoeses son bill jr is a walk down the memory lane 
of the us labor movement the walls of the conference room are 
lined with postersize photographs of union leaders exhorting 
crowds of rankandfile members and of world airways stewardesses 
stripping off their clothes on a picket line in the 1960s in a 
contract dispute 
ive been out on the ground genoese said looking back on 
his early days as a general organizer around the country for the 
teamsters 
in the 1950s as an engineer and union activist at the phone 
company in new york genoese was galvanized by labor titans like 
hoffa and former united auto workers chief walter reuther it was 
the flamboyant hoffa who tapped genoese to join the teamsters as an 
organizer 
genoese a slight man with penetrating blue eyes grew up in the 
tough navy yard section of brooklyn ny our neighborhood was so 
poor they ripped it down to put a slum up he reminisced in his 
pungent brooklyn accent after serving in the navy he got an 
engineering degree from pratt institute in new york and went to 
work as a phone company engineer before joining the teamsters in 
1961 
genoese has long advocated selling pan am to cure its financial 
ills and has allied himself with several suitors most recently 
towers financial corp towers a debtcollection and insurance 
holding company based in new york has said it intends to launch a 
takeover bid for pan am with the teamsters backing 
but towers overture already viewed with skepticism by wall 
street analysts probably lost more credibility in august when the 
securities and exchange commission charged towers with selling 20 
million in unregistered securities to finance a debtcollection 
program 
towers chairman steven hoffenberg admitted recently that it 
would be extremely difficult to acquire pan am at this point 
without the cooperation of the airlines management 
in addition to his continuing relationship with towers genoese 
also persuaded a coalition of pan am unions to hire the powerhouse 
investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc to explore a possible 
buyout 
his ability to wire these networks across the traditional 
boundaries of the haves and havenots mixing oldstyle labor 
politics with newstyle wheeling and dealing on wall street is 
what helps genoese keep management off balance observers say 
people on wall street know the teamsters have money behind 
them they understand economics genoese asserted it opens any 
door

in the coming weeks as stores and shopping 
malls fill with people buying christmas gifts it might look like 
any other holiday season 
but the bustle will mask the fact that cautious consumer 
spending has forced retailers to take a subdued approach to this 
christmas and their prospects for meaningful sales growth in the 
foreseeable future 
nonetheless stores are expected to have a profitable season 
last year i played ebenezer scrooge said robert buchanan 
an analyst with the investment firm ag edwards amp sons inc in st 
louis this year im a little more upbeat especially with 
respect to earnings because of the constructive steps the 
retailers have taken in recognition of slower sales 
said michael wellman vice president for marketing at k mart 
corp christmas is going to be very competitive but no reason 
to be gnashing ones teeth over the consumer who doesnt seem to 
have much enthusiasm 
estimates of sales growth this season range from 4 percent to 6 
percent over christmas 1987 levels or about the pace of inflation 
so far this year thats what economist david wyss calls a 
mediocre christmas not a terrible one 
people are a little bit nervous about the economy said 
wyss of data resources inc a lexington massbased economic 
forecasting service 
its been a year since the stock market crash but i dont 
think the crash has entirely left their minds he said 
higher interest rates relatively weak growth in income and a 
low savings rate are also contributing to consumers uneasiness 
wyss said 
these factors have been cited consistently over the past year 
and a half as reasons for the slowdown in sales that forced 
retailers to take steep markdowns and eroded their profits several 
of the nations biggest storeowners have posted sales increases of 
3 percent or less so far in 1988 which means theyve been losing 
ground to inflation 
to make matters worse christmas 1987 was a dismal time for 
retailers and it led to lowkey sales forecasts for this holiday 
season 
buchanan predicted sales in the next two months will be fair to 
poor he said hes seen growth in americans disposable income but 
consumers are so strapped by debt that theyre going to use a 
lot of the cash to pay down debt rather than play santa claus 
modestly good was the forecast from monroe h greenstein an 
analyst with bear stearns amp co greenstein predicted retailers 
would take fewer markdowns than they did last christmas season 
because theyve kept their inventories lean 
most of the sales are going to be planned and part of budgets 
and not be sales in the true sense of the word he said 
retailers are currently preparing for the holidays the major 
companies are planning special themes and events and some stores 
are already displaying decorations or seasonal merchandise 
even consumers who havent ventured into stores lately know 
from the christmas catalogs spilling out of their mailboxes that 
the holiday season is fast approaching 
christmas is makeitorbreak it time for retailers because they 
earn as much of 60 percent of their annual profits during the 
fourth quarter but even if this season proves to be unexciting 
there is little fear that earnings will suffer 
retailers are generally lean on their inventories heading into 
christmas said buchanan less merchandise on hand means less 
merchandise to be marked down at the end of the season 
lean inventories have become a way of retail life and not just 
at holiday time after sales softened last year and a hopedfor 
recovery never materialized storeowners learned to reduce their 
merchandise levels and cut expenses 
but if retail executives are depressed or resigned because 
business is slow they dont show it 
we have lived with the softness with consumer sales long 
enough that weve turned to optimism said kenneth macke 
chairman of dayton hudson corp weve learned to live with it 
learned to control inventories very well learned how to make the 
consumer happy 
we feel that even with sluggish sales we can have earnings 
increases macke said 
greenstein the bear stearns analyst agreed that retailers have 
gotten used to the new environment 
theyre placing greater emphasis on profitability and less on 
sales he said 
added buchanan smarter retailers are closing poorer stores 
and reinvesting resources into their better stores youre 
seeing a paring of overhead and a reduction of buying staffs a 
reduction of floor help and a reduction at the expense level 
this doesnt mean however that retailers are standing still 
macke noted that his company recently bought 31 gold circle stores 
in order to help expand its target discount store division 
at k mart were probably going to see some acceleration in 
our store opening program and the company continues to add new 
technology such as inventory control systems and satellite dishes 
to communicate with its farflung stores wellman said 
and although sales may be sluggish the stores are still 
pursuing customers 
according to macke retailers must find a formula that attracts 
consumers who are better educated today and who are concerned with 
value getting a good deal on good merchandise 
we made an effort to improve our quality in all our 
companies he said if you have merchandise that is wellpriced 
but does not have the quality the consumer wants they wont 
spend 
the top retailers today according to buchanan are those that 
find an untapped market and stake a claim there as the discount 
retailer walmart stores inc did 
walmart arguably the most successful retailer in the country 
set up shop mostly in small towns offered low prices and 
emphasized customer service the company consistently outperforms 
its competitors and was one of the few bright stars in this past 
lackluster year 
anybody who has a defined niche where they do very well is 
continuing to do well buchanan said

with pressure growing to come up with a 
way to limit gushing oil production ministers from eight opec 
nations are meeting thursday for further talks on the persistent 
disarray in the world oil market 
its a big showdown said peter gignoux director of the 
international energy department at the shearson lehman hutton inc 
brokerage in london 
the time has come to see whether certain opec producers will 
conform to new quotas he said if they dont conform we will 
have pure chaos in opec 
saudi arabia and other nations have been producing above their 
quotas jockeying for position in advance of the thursday meeting 
in madrid spain and a gathering nov 21 in vienna austria of 
all 13 members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
the pickup in production has added to already plentiful world 
supplies and kept prices weak on the volatile oil market prices 
have been seesawing in recent weeks between 12 and 16 a barrel 
which is still well below opecs target of 18 
over the weekend saudi arabia and three other arab members of 
opec called on the cartels members to restrain production but also 
recommended that opec boost its official output ceiling excluding 
iraq from about 15 million barrels a day to a minimum of 174 
million barrels 
the ceiling proposed by these arab nations members of the gulf 
cooperation council would include iraq but would be well under 
opecs current total production of an estimated 21 million to 22 
million barrels a day 
gignoux called the suggested cap not a workable number 
nick antill an oil analyst at the london brokerage county 
natwest described the outcome of the council talks as quite 
depressing because no new production formula was offered 
as a result he said the madrid meeting could end with the oil 
officials sticking to the current production accord as part of 
their constant attempt to patch another hole in the dike 
the councils proposal would make room for iraq in the quota 
system allotting it the same share of 24 million barrels a day 
now held by former enemy iran iraq in the past has refused to 
honor its quota of 15 million barrels a day because it wanted 
parity with iran 
oil prices rose after the councils statement but retreated when 
iran rejected any suggestion of parity with iraq tehran radio said 
such an idea was totally unprincipled 
the gulf cooperation council is comprised of six nations on the 
persian gulf four members saudi arabia the united arab emirates 
kuwait and qatar also belong to opec the other two nations oman 
and bahrain do not 
the councils discussions were considered important because of 
the influene wielded by saudi arabia the worlds largest oil 
exporter 
the madrid talks called as a joint meeting of two opec 
committees will bring officials of iran and iraq to their first 
cartel meeting since an august ceasefire in their 8yearold war 
both iran and iraq want to export more oil to pay the hefty tabs 
of rebuilding their wardamaged economies 
analysts estimate iraq has been pumping at least 26 million 
barrels of crude a day an amount that could soar to 37 million 
barrels in mid1989 with completion of a new pipeline through saudi 
arabia to the red sea 
iran has been producing an estimated 25 million barrels daily 
analysts say 
earlier this month saudi arabia warned other nations it would 
continue producing more than its opec share unless other cartel 
members stuck to their limits analysts said the oil giant recently 
boosted production to as much as 56 million barrels a day topping 
its official quota of 43 million barrels 
the pricing committee one of the two panels meeting in madrid 
is made up of algeria saudi arabia nigeria indonesia and 
venezuela the other panel the longterm strategy committee 
includes iraq iran kuwait saudi arabia and venezuela 
the remaining opec members are ecuador gabon libya qatar and 
the united arab emirates

kraft inc officials began mulling an 11 
billion takeover offer but industry analysts said the sheer size 
of philip morris cos incs cash bid left the processedfoods 
giant nearly defenseless 
my own feeling is that philip morris is not going to take no 
for an answer said john c mcmillin an analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
meanwhile kraft on tuesday reported a 17 percent profit gain in 
the third quarter reflecting the strong earnings growth that is 
part of its appeal to philip morris 
kraft said it was studying philip morris 90pershare tender 
offer announced monday and expected to make a recommendation to 
its shareholders by oct 31 a purchase at that price would be the 
second biggest business acquisition in us history 
unidentified sources quoted in todays editions of the new york 
times said the leveraged buyout specialist kohlberg kravis roberts 
amp co may be offering its services to kraft management the paper 
said the bidding for kraft could climb by another 1 billion if 
kohlberg enters the fray 
kraft closed at 8837 up 2825 tuesday on the new york stock 
exchange in reaction to philip morris unsolicited offer 
kraft based north of chicago in glenview already has indicated 
its desire to remain independent but many analysts who follow the 
company say kraft would be hardpressed to devise a plan for 
raising the value of its stock to the price being offered by 
deeppocketed philip morris 
their options are very limited by the bidder being philip 
morris and the willingness of philip morris to go further if they 
have to mcmillin said 
philip morris chairman hamish maxwell has indicated his 
willingness to negotiate an amicable transaction which is 
believed to mean he is willing to offer more for kraft 
analysts likened krafts situation to that of pillsbury co 
which urged its stockholders on tuesday to reject grand 
metropolitan plcs unsolicited 523 billion bid for the food and 
restaurant company 
grand mets offer for pillsbury is about 21 times the companys 
earnings philip morris bid for kraft is about 26 times krafts 
earnings 
when you get a pass at you of 22 23 24 times earnings id 
take the money and run said john maxwell jr an analyst with 
wheat first securities inc in richmond va 
i dont see how you can turn premiums like that down if youre 
taking care of your shareholders 
analyst roger spencer of painewebber inc in chicago said philip 
morris bid could spark a bidding war for kraft which boasts 
strong growth potential and very little debt but other analysts 
dismissed that notion saying few companies could better the philip 
morris offer 
philip morris has filed a lawsuit in us district court in 
chicago challenging krafts first line of defense a poison 
pill that kicks in when an unwanted suitor acquires 20 percent of 
kraft stock in that event kraft would double the number of shares 
held by all other stockholders making a buyout prohibitively 
expensive 
but analysts said poison pill challenges were standard procedure 
in takeover wars and they doubted a battle for kraft would turn on 
the court case 
analyst roy burry of kidder peabody amp co in new york said 
kraft might bring in a white knight a third company with which it 
would merge to defeat philip morris 
mcmillin said krafts only chance to remain independent might be 
a pac man defense in which kraft would turn attacker and offer 
to buy philip morris in a deal that would be financed by selling 
some assets of the new yorkbased tobacco and food company 
but mcmillin acknowledged that such a scenario was a bit 
farfetched 
in its thirdquarter earnings statement tuesday kraft reported 
net income of 1487 million or 120 per share for the 13 weeks 
ending sept 24 compared with 1269 million or 92 cents per 
share for the same period a year ago 
revenues for the period advanced 12 percent to 28 billion from 
25 billion 
the quarterly results include net income of 10 million from 
duracell the battery division that kraft sold to a management 
group for 6856 million in the second quarter and which kraft 
counted as a discontinued operation 
for the first three quarters of 1988 kraft reported net income 
of 11 billion or 820 per share compared with 3918 million 
or 286 per share for the same period in 1987 
sales for the first three quarters advanced 13 percent to 83 
billion from 73 billion 
the cumulative results for the first three quarters of 1987 were 
restated to reflect a 452 million gain in the first quarter 
resulting from an accounting change

japan marked the anniversary of the global stock 
market crash with the ultimate vote of confidence the largest 
equity issue in the world so far this year 
the release of new shares in nippon telegraph and telephone 
corp the worlds biggest company appeared to have started 
successfully wednesday despite the stratospheric price of nearly 
15000 per share 
the third of at least four ntt issues planned by the government 
totaled 15 million shares with a value of 225 billion 
individual shares were priced at 19 million yen a share or 
14986 calculated at a 35 percent discount from wednesdays 
closing price on the tokyo stock exchange 
even at that whopping pershare price considered a bargain by 
this markets superinflated standards dealers said the offering 
was popular with investors the price was about 26 percent below 
that of the second issue which was sold last nov 10 at 18854 a 
share 
its a fairly good price and we hardly had any problems 
selling out all of our allotment said ichitaro watanabe a 
broker at nikko securities co 
ntt has a total market value of about 250 billion qualifying 
it for the premier position among the worlds corporate giants by 
contrast american telephone amp telegraph co has a market value of 
about 29 billion 
the finance ministry is now threequarters of the way through a 
program of selling half of its ntt shares to the public foreigners 
are not permitted to buy the shares 
after the first issue of 195 million shares which was offered 
at 9300 per share in february 1987 the share price soared to 
25000 in less than six months the second issue offered at 
18854 sold easily despite the terrifying global market crash 
only three weeks earlier 
analyst ichiro kitada said the relatively low price of the 
latest issue shows the new reality for privatization stocks in 
japan 
the illogical myth that privatization issues are destined to 
rise forever was finally proven wrong said kitada a private 
investment consultant with over 30 years experience in the 
japanese market 
the lackluster performance of ntt stock in recent weeks caused 
the finance ministry in september to reduce the size of the latest 
issue from the original 195 million to 15 million shares that 
sent a signal to the market that pressured the share price to its 
lowest level since soon after it was first listed on the tokyo 
stock exchange 
analysts attribute the recent slump to a combination of the 
overall bearishness of the tokyo market uncertainties created by 
emperor hirohitos illness and concern that ntt shares are 
overpriced at about 130 times earnings the average us stock now 
sells for about 13 times earnings 
the tokyo market itself has not been going anywhere in the 
past months ntt alone cant fly by itself said watanabe 
some analysts believe the finance ministry and the securities 
industry will not join in propping up the share price because of 
public concern over recent scandals involving shareprice 
manipulation 
it is widely believed that such an alliance to prop up ntt 
shares ahead of the past two issues existed said kitada but 
if anything similar to that was done for the current issue in the 
middle of media scrutiny and market sensitivity the public is not 
going to tolerate that 
ironically the decline in price attracted institutional 
investors who bought only 15 percent of the two previous ntt 
offers 
in the past two offers bullishness was the motivation for 
buying ntt but this time the low price is said keiichi 
nishida broker for the tokyo office of kidder peabody i must 
say 2 million yen is a good bargain for a piece of that company 
considering its size and performance and potential for growth 
some observers hope the popularity of the new issue will help 
shore up the shaky foundations of the tokyo market which has shown 
signs of instability even as it has outperformed most others around 
the world since last octobers crash 
it was the most promising share in the market said mike 
morizumi an analyst at merrill lynchs tokyo office the market 
was aware that it was in everyones interest to push up ntt shares 
it means more revenue for the finance ministry more commission for 
the securities industry and profit for investors 
ntt is one of the best performers in japans highgrowth 
economy showing an aftertax profit for the fiscal year ended 
march 31 of 24324 billion yen 192 billion up 64 percent from 
the previous year

european trade officials sought 
wednesday to put to rest american fears that the giant consumer 
market that will be formed in western europe in 1992 will 
discriminate against us and other foreign firms 
willy de clercq the top trade official of the european economic 
community told reporters 1992 will not mean protectionism 
it would be absurd for the community to move toward a policy of 
protectionism 
de clercq and other top officials of the 12nation trading bloc 
issued a statement designed to spell out the implications for other 
countries of the move to create a single europeanwide market by 
the end of 1992 
to meet that goal the 12 nations of the european community 
also known as the common market are dismantling trade barriers 
that separate them 
the united states has repeatedly expressed concern that in 
lifting restrictions on internal trade the europeans might try to 
keep out us and other foreign competition 
but de clercq insisted that fears the europeans will set up new 
barriers to trade and form a fortress europe were senseless 
and groundless 
i hope the very clear signals that this commission the blocs 
executive body has given in order to show its willingness to 
be a world partner and not a fortress can help alleviate all kinds 
of fears he said 
de clercq and lord cockfield the top official for the internal 
market also sought to allay concerns about the communitys use of 
the word reciprocity in discussing how much access foreign firms 
will have in business fields such as financial services not yet 
governed by international trade rules 
i would like to express my astonishment said de clercq 
that this word gives rise to such emotional reactions 
what we do not want is for reciprocity to mean something other 
than the same advantages for everyone he said 
we do not have the intention of asking all our partners to 
make the same concessions he said 
the common market he said was not considering identical 
reciprocity but rather equivalent reciprocity which he 
described as the balance of advantages a fair deal where 
everyone stands to benefit 
the statement issued by the trade group said the community 
will offer free access to 1992 benefits for firms from countries 
whose market is already open or which are prepared to open up their 
markets 
us officials fear the use of a reciprocity guideline will 
subject us banks to crippling restrictions because american 
banking rules are much tighter than those in some european 
countries the glasssteagall act separates commercial and 
investment banking in the united states a distinction not 
recognized in parts of europe 
us officials want the common market to apply a standard of 
national treatment to foreign firms so that us banks and other 
operations will be treated in the new market just like european 
companies 
cockfield said the reciprocity clause was put in a draft 
proposal on 1992 banking rules as a bargaining tool to open up 
other countries markets during the current round of international 
trade negotiations 
our objective here he said is not a restrictive one it 
is ultimately one of getting the most liberal regime that can be 
negotiated in the world as a whole 
he said however that the community would take a look at the 
amount of access given european firms in a foreign country when one 
of its companies makes an initial application to operate in the 
european market 
he dismissed speculation that the community would try to limit 
the operations of companies that are already established in the 
community 
i find it difficult to envisage a situation in which we would 
want to do that sort of thing he said 
spokesmen for the us mission to the common market were in a 
meeting and could not be immediately reached for comment 
cockfield also cautioned the united states and japan against 
taking protectionist steps that would force the europeans to 
respond 
the great threat to a liberal world trading system is 
protectionist legislation in america and protectionist attitudes in 
japan he said it is this sort of thing that generates a mood 
in which people talk about retaliation 
the trading group is made up of britain ireland belgium 
france the netherlands germany denmark greece portugal spain 
luxembourg and italy

wheat and soybean futures bolstered by a slight 
pickup in foreign demand closed modestly higher wednesday on the 
chicago board of trade while corn and oat futures prices finished 
mostly lower 
exporters said egypt had purchased 250000 metric tons of us 
wheat at subsidized prices and china bought 170000 metric tons 
also at prices subsidized under an agriculture department program 
to boost exports 
taiwan was said to have purchased 27000 metric tons of us 
soybeans at market prices and was expected to bid for another 
54000 metric tons tonight 
the sales lifted the spirits of market bulls who have been 
dismayed by a general slowdown in export business and by the 
failure of government negotiators to hammer out a new longterm 
agreement for soviet purchases of us grain analysts said 
until the trade picture improves or some other major change in 
market fundamentals occurs the markets will continue to lack 
conviction and meander in a fairly narrow range without any real 
force behind them said rich feltes director of commodities 
research for refco inc a commodities brokerage based in chicago 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents higher with 
december at 426 a bushel corn was unchanged to 1 cents lower

storms in the gulf of mexico last month forced 
domestic oil production to its lowest level in more than a decade 
the american petroleum institute reported wednesday 
septembers oil production was estimated at 794 million barrels 
a day a reduction of some 267000 barrels a day from a year ago 
it was the first time in more than 10 years that domestic oil 
production fell below 8 million barrels the trade group said 
more than 100000 barrels a day of the loss was attributed to 
two hurricanes one that passed across offshore oil fields as it 
moved into louisiana and another that threatened the same area 
before eventually hitting northern mexico both forced the shutdown 
of several refineries and production platforms 
meanwhile petroleum imports remained at 69 million barrels a 
day in september the despite stormrelated shipment delays the 
trade group said for the first nine months of the year imports 
were up 68 percent or 440000 barrels a day from last year 
in other areas the report said 
deliveries of refined petroleum products climbed 11 percent to 
169 million barrels in september compared with a year ago 
gasoline deliveries increased 12 percent to 73 million 
barrels with premium unleaded gasolines share of the market 
climbing to 23 percent from 20 percent last year and leaded 
gasolines share dropping to 17 percent 
deliveries of distillate oil which includes home heating oil 
and diesel fuel fell 02 percent in september due in part to the 
technical corrections bill now before congress 
the measure which may become law before the end of the year 
includes a provision making it unnecessary for farmers and other 
offhighway users of diesel fuel to prepay the federal excise tax 
many users apparently have postponed their purchases in 
anticipation of the bills passage the oil group said 
crude oil inventories fell for the third month in a row to 324 
million barrels the lowest level in more than a year distillate 
stocks meanwhile rose 7 million barrels and stood at 3 million 
barrels higher than a year earlier total stocks exceeded 1 billion 
barrels

the government wednesday appointed inspectors to 
investigate possible insider trading of stock in consolidated gold 
fields plc ahead of a takeover bid by south africancontrolled 
minorco sa 
trade and industry secretary lord young said the investigators 
have been asked to report to him as quickly as possible 
concerning possible insider trading and concertparty share 
ownership of the companys stock this occurs when one company 
secretly agrees to buy stock for another firm 
the investigation announced shortly after the close of the 
london stock market is being conducted at the request of the 
company young said 
consolidated gold fields has alleged that insider dealing and 
share building by parties related to minorco occurred in the weeks 
ahead of the sept 21 launch of the bid which it is fighting 
it said the activity was fully consistent with insider dealers 
having knowledge of both the time and value of the bid 
the company claims that the activity affected its chances of 
fending off the takeover attempt 
the investigation comes less than a week ahead of the oct 25 
close of the minorco bid minorco is offering 19 pounds 33 cash 
and one new minorco share for every two gold fields shares 
a spokesman for the department of trade and industry said the 
minorco bid would not necessarily be stopped if the investigation 
turns up evidence of insider trading or concertparty purchases 
minorco has also called for an investigation of share dealings 
ahead of the bid 
the department of trades office of fair trading is also 
expected to make a recommendation shortly on whether the bid should 
be investigated for its impact on competition

making the rounds of wall street that a newspaper story potentially 
damaging to the presidential campaign of vice president bush would

thirdquarter results tuesday with bellsouth corp announcing its 
profits were flat and ameritech posting a 23 percent earnings 
decline 
atlantabased bellsouth said its earnings totaled 4196 
million or 89 cents a share compared with 4186 million or 87 
cents a share in the third quarter of 1987 
revenue increased to 346 billion from 311 billion a year 
earlier 
the company whose telephone units include southern bell and 
south central bell said earnings growth was held in check partly 
because of accounting changes ordered by the federal communications 
commission 
bellsouth said its earnings for the first nine months of the 
year totaled 5971 million or 261 per share down 23 percent 
from 7775 million or 261 per share in the same period of 1987 
the company had sharply higher expenses during the first three 
quarters of this year 
revenue for the period totaled 1002 billion compared with 
908 billion a year earlier 
chicagobased ameritech said its earnings for the third quarter 
totaled 2811 million or 207 per share compared with 3011 
million or 216 per share in the same period a year earlier 
the company the parent of bell telephone companies serving 
illinois indiana michigan ohio and wisconsin said its earnings 
were reduced by charges related to the sale of its systems software 
subsidiary applied data research inc 
the company reported thirdquarter revenue of 251 billion up 
from 243 billion in the 1987 quarter 
ameritech reported ninemonth earnings of 9277 million or

general dynamics corp said wednesday an 
electric boat division strike and continued investments in advanced 
aerospace programs combined to lower the defense contractors 
thirdquarter earnings by 135 percent 
general dynamics had earnings of 964 million or 229 per 
share compared with 1115 million or 262 per share for the 
same period in 1987 earnings for the years first nine months were 
2688 million or 639 per share compared with 342 million or 
799 per share one year earlier 
sales of 23 billion for the third quarter and 7 billion for 
the first nine months compared with those of 23 billion and 69 
billion in 1987 
general dynamics funded backlog at the end of the third quarter 
was 158 billion and its total backlog funded and unfunded was 
229 billion representing approximately 24 years of sales the 
company said comparable figures a year ago were 152 billion and 
229 billion 
stanley c pace chairman and chief executive officer said the 
work stoppage at the electric boat division in groton conn was 
the principal cause of general dynamics thirdquarter decline 
however we believe that terms of the oct 11 electric boat 
labor settlement improve our position for future submarine 
competitions pace said our recent award of the 16th trident 
submarine continues our role as the sole builder of that very 
important class 
cited also by pace were continued investments in the atlas 
expendable launch vehicle program and advanced aerospace programs 
particularly the air forces advanced tactical fighter 
while these programs are currently incurring high development 
costs we expect them to make significant contributions to 
operating earnings in the long term pace said our overall 
commitment to cost containment is evidenced at land systems and at 
cessna both of which show improved earnings

most investors hurt by the stock crash a year 
ago wednesday didnt rush into court to sue brokers for negligence 
contrary to expectations of a litigation tidal wave lawyers and 
securities professionals say 
reviewing what happened a year after the collapse erased 500 
billion in paper profits they offered several explanations for the 
surprisingly few suits for one thing many disputes were 
arbitrated outside of court for another many investors simply 
realized that severe risk is part of the stock market game 
i think people sort of assessed this as a freak act of 
nature said william fitzpatrick general counsel of the 
securities industry association a trade group of brokerages 
certain things happen in life that are nobodys fault like a 
hurricane 
at this time last year fitzpatrick and others in the securities 
business were bracing for an onslaught of suits by investors who 
felt betrayed by the stunning collapse in prices after five years 
of record growth 
many complained about their inability to execute orders or even 
get brokers on the telephone as their portfolios tumbled in value 
some accused brokers of panicking and selling their own positions 
before taking care of clients 
the number of crashrelated lawsuits remains unclear partly 
because there is no one single group that keeps track of such 
statistics 
all i have are anecdotal things which ive discussed with 
others said fitzpatrick almost universally theyve said they 
anticipated a dramatic increase and it just hasnt materialized 
part of the reason is that as the emotions raised by the crash 
eased a good deal of these gripes were resolved by rational 
discussions between investors and brokers 
other investors reckoned that even with their losses they had 
still done better in the market over the past several years 
some realized it was an overall market situation and decided 
to be big boys and girls and take their lumps said edward 
mcdevitt a prominent securitieslaw litigator in charleston w 
va many of these people are still way ahead 
some securities industry critics say the lack of lawsuits is 
deceptive and to a great extent reflects the language in many 
brokerage contracts requiring disputes to be settled by arbitration 
the north american securities administrators assocation a group 
of state securities regulators says the number of arbitration 
cases soared after crash 
in a survey released earlier this month the association also 
said two out of three small investors who encountered problems with 
brokers during the crash have not been able to resolve their 
complaints 
the new york stock exchange american stock exchange and 
national association of securities dealers the electronic 
overthecounter market have all experienced sharp rises in the 
number of arbitration cases 
at the american arbitration association which also handles 
securitiesrelated disputes the number of brokerinvestor cases 
more than quadrupled in the 12 months since the crash compared with 
the 12 months preceding it said george friedman vice president 
for case administration 
its also very clear from talking to people whove gone into 
arbitration that if they had the option of going to court they 
definitely would have said scott stapf director of investor 
education for the north american securities administrators group 
others strongly disagree stephen ratner a new york attorney 
who represents bear stearns amp co a defendant in one of the few 
prominent crashrelated suits filed said the story with the 
crash is theres no story its a situation in which the brokers 
arent to blame 
he has moved to dismiss the complaint against bear stearns by a 
group of investors who blame the firm for several million dollars 
in stock losses during the crash

the first negotiating session in 
nearly 17 months between striking united auto workers and officials 
of the colt firearms division broke off wednesday after just 14 
minutes of mediated talks 
there was no movement said robert madore president of uaw 
local 376 we met separately for about 12 minutes broke up 
came back face to face for another two minutes and broke up 
madore said the company and the union are still deadlocked over 
the issue of whether the company can keep the 725 replacement 
workers it has hired to replace the strikers 
the companys position is that the replacement workers stay 
madore said were not going to cave in on that all the strikers 
have to go back 
richard reibeling vice president for personnel at colt firearms 
division and the companys chief negotiator said the two parties 
are 180 degrees apart with the issue of replacement workers at 
the center of the dispute 
the strike began in january 1986 when 1000 members of uaw local 
376 struck over a failure of both sides to reach a new contract 
after months of negotiations 
the company hired replacements at its hartford and west hartford 
plants and production has continued throughout the strike in 
addition 200 union members have returned to work company 
officials said 
wednesdays talks held under the guidance of state and federal 
mediators at the state department of labor offices in wethersfield 
were the first since negotiators for the union and colt met on may 
27 1987 
state department of labor spokesman richard ficks said no date 
has been set for future talks

wednesday after barely budging abroad but foreign exchange traders 
said the late movement was caused largely by internal market 
conditions and not outside news 
gold prices were narrowly mixed in the united states after 
falling slightly overseas in choppy trading which bullion brokers

gold market 
oil prices jumped 79 cents a barrel in hectic trading one day 
after they fell 60 cents reflecting ambivalence about the effect 
of an organization of petroleum exporting countries ministerial 
meeting gold an historical hedge against inflation tends to move 
in the opposite direction of oil prices 
currency brokers said the dollar continued to trade in a narrow 
range based on technical factors and was unaffected by external 
events many expected that trend to persist at least until after 
the november election 
in tokyo the dollar fell 085 yen to 12685 yen later in 
london it was quoted at 12720 yen by the time trading ended in

shearson lehman hutton inc one of the nations 
biggest investment firms reported an 85 percent drop in 
thirdquarter earnings wednesday attributing it to postcrash 
investor apathy expenses from the purchase of ef hutton group 
inc and higher shortterm interest rates 
painewebber group inc also reported a lack of retail and 
institutional activity but the firm managed to post a sharp gain 
in the quarter partly on the sale of its interest in a car rental 
company 
issuing its thirdquarter results on the anniversary of the 
stock crash a year ago shearson said it earned 8 million or 2 
cents a share in the three months ended sept 30 vs 54 million 
or 54 cents a share a year earlier 
thirdquarter revenues totaled 263 billion up 67 percent from 
the 157 billion a year earlier prior to the december acquisition 
of hutton 
for the first nine months of the year shearson reported 
earnings of 140 million or 139 a share down 29 percent from the 
196 million or 216 a share reported a year earlier results this 
year included 144 million in pretax onetime acquisitionrelated 
expenses 
ninemonth revenues totaled 764 billion up 54 percent from 
496 billion a year earlier 
the decline in the third quarter and yeartodate earnings 
reflects a significant decrease in investor participation in the 
financial markets along with nonrecurring mergerrelated 
expenses that we are incurring this year peter a cohen 
chairman and chief executive officer said in a statement 
in addition thirdquarter net interest income declined from 
the yearago period due largely to a narrower interest margin 
caused by a rise in shortterm rates he said these factors 
more than offset strong results in investment banking market 
making and principal transactions and investment advisory 
businesses 
the company largely has completed the incorporation of hutton 
and a major costcutting program which resulted in the layoffs of 
thousands of exhutton employees nevertheless cohen said because 
of business conditions we plan to continue companywide efforts 
to further reduce operating expenses 
there was no elaboration but many wall street professionals 
have said privately that unless business improves in the next six 
months they expect further layoffs and cutbacks 
at painewebber thirdquarter earnings jumped 41 percent to 
209 million or 50 cents a share from 148 million or 44 cents 
a share a year ago 
revenue during the period advanced at a much slower pace 
however revenue totaled 6424 million in the quarter up 2 
percent from 6286 million a year ago 
the company noted that the sale of its investment in national 
car rental system inc contributed a 46 million pretax gain during 
the third quarter otherwise the company said overall results 
continue to be negatively affected by a lack of investor activity 
since the market crash 
for the first nine months earnings fell 36 percent to 418 
million or 77 cents a share from 65 million or 201 a share a 
year earlier revenue for the yeartodate totaled 18 billion 
down from 19 billion in the first nine months of 1987

theres a very strong chance copper could well take out the

analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
labor problems have already cost peru a 17 percent decline in 
copper production through august of this year anagnos said the

analysts said overall copper production outside of north america 
was expected to decline this year the united states was the 
worlds secondlargest copper producer last year just behind 
chile and canada ranked third 
yet demand for the metal has been strong in recent weeks due to 
seasonal factors and to the strong economies of the major 
industrialized nations 
the american bureau of metal statistics reported domestic 
refined copper inventories of 52500 short tons at the end of 
august a seemingly healthy gain from 42000 short tons in june 
but more than half of the increase was due to a buildup in comex 
warehouse stocks which have declined rapidly since august

newly approved circuit breakers designed to halt 
trading if stock prices take a sudden plunge could actually provoke 
a frenzied selloff as investors rush to beat the deadline the 
president of the american stock exchange said wednesday 
speaking on the first anniversary of the october stock crash 
amex president kenneth r leibler said circuit breakers are the 
most visible change that has been made to prevent a repeat of the 
crash 
but he said their effect is uncertain 
there is a school of thought that says that as the market 
moves toward the circuit breaker investors may rush to get out 
knowing that the markets going to close and it may even 
exacerbate the trend leibler said during a news conference 
there is no experience with this in the markets and i dont 
think there is any guarantee that this will be productive he 
added 
leibler in boston to address an executive symposium said he 
believed wall street and the us government must go further 
addressing larger structural issues and not just the 
mechanical or technical causes of the crash 
the circuit breaker plan was approved tuesday as a oneyear 
experiment by the securities and exchange commission and the 
commodity futures trading commission if the dow jones average of 
30 industrial stocks drops 250 points in a single day trading on 
the major us exchanges will automatically be halted for one hour 
if there is an additional 150point plunge for a total of 400 
points in a single day a second circuit breaker will impose a 
twohour halt 
leibling said the american stock exchange will cooperate with 
the plan which is intended to provide a coolingoff period 
during a panic like the one that hit wall street on oct 19 1987 
when the dow jones average fell 508 points 
he also said he thought the chances of another crash are slight 
because the market appears to be quite reasonably valued by 
historic standards and in relation to corporate profits 
but he said additional steps are needed to win back the 
confidence of small investors 
i think instead of focusing so much on the symptoms which is 
trying to eliminate or change rules about particular products i 
think we have to focus on the infrastructure which is to continue 
to invest at the exchanges in greater technology to be able to 
handle greater activity he said 
in addition leibler said there are steps that should be taken 
in washington 
the situation that we currently have today where the markets 
are all independently regulated where the futures markets and the 
securities markets are regulated by two entities who in turn are 
overseen by two different congressional committees i think that 
long term places us at a severe disadvantage with other world 
markets and i think it is a very very inefficient system and a 
potential cause for instability he said

outgrowth of last years hearings on the nomination of robert bork 
to the supreme court 
the video privacy protection act was approved by voice vote and 
sent to president reagan 
the measure which cleared the senate last week was written

the video rental records of bork whose nomination was the subject 
of a lengthy and bitter battle in the senate

conducting the nomination hearing expressed outrage at what they 
said was a violation of borks privacy

members democrats paul simon of illinois and patrick leahy of 
vermont and republicans alan simpson of wyoming and charles 
grassley of iowa 
under the measure video stores would be prohibited from 
releasing information about any customers rentals or purchases of 
video tapes unless they have the permission of the customer 
janlori goldman staff attorney of the american civil liberties 
unions privacy and technology project said the movies one views 
in the privacy of ones home reveal personal information which 
should be afforded legal protection 
the legislation establishes an important precedent for our 
continuing efforts to pass legislation expanding privacy safeguards 
for personal information such as medical insurance and personnel

the pentagon on wednesday suspended the 
sundstrand corp from doing business with the government saying it 
wasnt satisfied with the companys response to being caught up in 
a huge defense fraud case 
sundstrand which last week agreed to pay 115 million in the 
largest single fraud settlement in history has been barred 
indefinitely from government contracting and governmentapproved 
subcontracting a pentagon statement said 
defense officials has not been convinced that corrective 
actions undertaken thus far have been adequate it added 
the contracting suspension applies to the parent corporation as 
well as six subsidiaries sundstrand data control inc falk 
corp sundstrand heat transfer inc sundstrand service corp 
sullair corp and signatron inc 
the suspension was imposed by the defense logistics agency but 
applies to all government agencies the pentagon said it does not 
affect existing contracts already held by sundstrand which is 
based in rockford ill 
this action is based upon information that sundstrand 
submitted false claims to the department of defense and conspired 
to defraud the federal government the pentagon said 
sundstrand spokesman claude vernam said the suspension was not 
unexpected saying weve known it was always a possibility 
vernam said he could not estimate the value of the contracts 
sundstrand would lose as a result of the suspension nor the value 
of the companys existing contracts with the government 
but sundstrand said in a statement it had implemented a program 
to ensure compliance with requirements for doing business with the 
federal government and was working with the defense logistics 
agency to ensure that they have confidence in the companys 
present responsiblity as a government contractor 
larry j wilson a spokesman for the defense logistics agency 
said he could not estimate how long the suspension might last nor 
could he predict the immediate financial impact on sundstrand 
wilson said there were at least two contracts pending for which 
sundstrand was bidding one worth roughly 800000 at the defense 
industrial supply center in philadelphia and another worth about 3 
million at the defense construction supply center in columbus ohio 
sundstrand a manufacturer of electronic mechanical and 
hydraulic systems for aircraft agreed on oct 12 agreed to pay 
115 million to the government and to plead guilty to four counts 
of defrauding the defense department by overbilling on aircraft 
parts 
at the same time its sundstrand data control subsidiary settled 
a separate case by agreeing to pay 13 million that case involved 
charges the company had used unallowable costs to inflate its 
overhead rates 
the us attorney in chicago anton valukas said a federal 
investigation had determined that besides overbilling for aircraft 
parts the company had been submitting claims for such things as 
babysitting expenses country clubs and servants for its executives 
the company also was attempting to improve its ability to 
market hardware to the defense department by giving gratuities to 
defense department personnel and their spouses while concealing 
their identity the government said 
sundstrand employees gave an estimated 100000 worth of liquor 
meals motel rooms golf outings and tickets to the theater 
hockey football and baseball games the government said they then 
submitted expense reports identifying the defense department 
workers they entertained only as a customer or government 
employee the complaint said 
the defense department accounts for 42 percent of sundstrands 
14 billion in annual sales and sundstrand acknowledged last week 
it might face a suspension or debarment after the pentagon reviewed 
the matter 
while representatives of sundstrand have been engaged in an 
active dialogue with officials of the defense logistics agency 
concerning these matters corrective actions undertaken thus far 
have not been adequate to convince dla that the company is a 
suitable business partner for the government the pentagon said 
wednesday 
accordingly the suspension action has been taken to protect 
the governments business interests as discussions with the company 
continue 
federal prosecutors have said they hope to complete a grand jury 
investigation of the company and its executives by january under 
pentagon contracting regulations however a suspension might not 
last that long 
the defense department normally considers a variety of factors 
in levying suspensions including such things as whether the 
contractor has paid back the government whether executives 
involved in a fraud have been dismissed and what the company is 
doing to prevent recurrances of misconduct 
the pentagon also can modify and narrow suspension orders to 
focus on certain parts or subsidiaries of a corporation rather than 
the entire concern

prosecutors wednesday searched the headquarters of 
two companies linked to an insider trading scandal involving some 
of japans top leaders officials said 
investigators from the tokyo district prosecutors office also 
searched the home of hiroshi matsubara chief aide to the former 
president of the two companies recruitcosmos a real estate firm 
and its parent recruit co 
officials from the prosecutors office confirmed the searches 
had been made but refused further comment 
the japan broadcasting corp said wednesday night investigators 
had removed more than 1000 boxes of financial records and other 
documents from the recruit headquarters in tokyos ginza district 
the searches and investigation were expected to have a strong 
impact on deliberations in japans parliament on a key tax reform 
package 
on tuesday opposition parties boycotted committee hearings on 
the proposed tax measures demanding witnesses be called to testify 
on the growing insider trading scandal and its connection to top 
politicians 
prime minister noboru takeshita finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa and other officials have admitted their aides bought 
shares in recruitcosmos before they were offered to the public and 
made large profits after the stock began trading on the 
overthecounter market and jumped in value 
last month yanosuke narazaki a member of parliament from the 
opposition united social democratic party filed a complaint with 
the prosecutors office charging matsubara had offered him bribes 
of 5 million yen 39000 to end his investigation into the case 
recruit officials have maintained matsubara acted alone in 
offering money to narazaki but government investigators suspect 
there was an organized attempt by recruit to stifle a parliamentary 
probe news reports said 
the searches wednesday were in response to narazakis complaint 
the reports said 
in a reference to the watergate scandal that resulted in the 
resignation of president richard nixon narazaki welcomed the 
prosecutors actions wednesday and said they had opened up the 
gate of the recruitgate scandal 
ruling liberal democratic party leaders met wednesday to discuss 
how to respond to opposition demands for the summoning of witnesses 
to a parliamentary probe of the scandal but did not agree on how 
to proceed the broadcasting corporation or nhk reported the 
party had hoped to begin formal debate on the tax bills by next 
week 
the insider trading scandal surfaced last summer when it was 
disclosed that dozens of unidentified politicians business leaders 
and journalists had acquired and resold shares in recruitcosmos 
last week the japan communist party released a list of nine 
people including miyazawa and aides to other key political 
leaders who it said had purchased shares in the company 
on tuesday miyazawa apologized for having failed to properly 
supervise an aide who he said had allowed a friend to buy 10000 
shares of stock in miyazawas name but miyazawa denied previous 
knowledge of the dealings 
the government has said the recruitcosmos purchases were legal 
but opposition parties charge they were unethical 
trading stocks on privileged information has been a common 
practice in japan but new laws passed since the scandal unfolded 
deal more stringently with insider trading

the teamsters union facing rankandfile 
resistance to its major contracts on wednesday abolished a 
decadesold requirement for a twothirds membership vote to reject 
tentative accords negotiated by its officers union sources said 
the change in the unions constitution allowing for a simple 
majority any no vote greater than 50 percent to reject a 
proposed contract was approved by the teamsters 18member 
executive board meeting in greenelefe fla the sources said 
speaking on the condition of anonymity 
the issue had been a major bone of contention in several 
contracts negotiated this year and in boston teamster leader 
william mccarthys upset victory over secretarytreasurer weldon 
mathis in claiming the unions presidency last july following the 
death of jackie presser 
it also was the target of a suit filed last may in us district 
court here against the union by a 10000member dissident faction 
teamsters for a democratic union 
duke zeller a teamster spokesman reached at greenelefe would 
not confirm or deny any changes in the unions constitution saying 
mccarthy planned to meet with representatives from 750 locals in 
chicago later this month to talk about new directions in the 
union 
however sources at greenelefe at the unions headquarters here 
and at some locals in the midwest confirmed that the board had 
voted to do away with the twothirds membership vote requirement 
for turning down a proposed contract 
ken paff an organizer for the detroitbased dissident faction 
called wednesdays decision a major victory saying teamster 
leaders had agreed to the change as part of an attempt to work 
out a settlement to the court suit 
we have been fighting for this steadily for 12 years paff 
said they called us nuts and screwballs but we finally have 
majority rule in this union 
paff said the change had nothing to do with another suit by 
the justice department seeking to wrest control of the teamsters 
from its top officers on grounds they are influenced by organized 
crime figures that suit filed in us district court in manhattan 
last june would empower a courtappointed trustee to run the union 
the feds have shown no interest in this its not a 
racketeering issue paff said theres no law there has to be 
any membership vote on approving contracts 
tdu had sought at the unions last convention in 1986 to change 
the teamsters constitution to require a majority rankandfile 
approval for any contract with a petition signed by 100 of the 
1800 delegates it was soundly defeated 
the issue came to a boil in may when 635 percent of voting 
truck drivers and warehouse workers under the nationwide master 
freight agreement covering some 200000 teamsters voted against a 
new threeyear contract with the trucking industry 
mathis then acting as the unions president while presser was 
hospitalized with brain and lung cancer declared the contract 
ratified saying the twothirds requirement for rejecting it had 
not been met 
mccarthy and several other teamster leaders had actively 
campaigned against signing the accord and had lobbied to reopen 
negotiations with bargaining agents for trucking company owners 
the trucking industry contract is one of several negotiated this 
year that has failed to garner majority support in rankandfile 
ratification votes 
others include signed contracts with united parcel service 
rejected by 53 percent of the covered voting members and stroh 
brewery co rejected by 54 percent 
a proposed contract covering some 20000 teamsters who drive 
auto transport trucks was renegotiated after it was rejected by 72 
percent on a first ratification vote results of a second 
ratification vote are due friday 
the only major contract approved by a majority of affected 
teamster members this year was with anheuserbusch cos covering 
some 9000 brewery workers 
paff and the teamster sources said the new language requiring 
majority approval of new contracts covers both nationwide and 
locally negotiated accords 
however they said it also includes a provision reverting to the 
twothirds rule if less than 50 percent of the affected members 
return ballots in any ratification vote

a rebound in apartment construction offset a 
decline in singlefamily home building boosting overall housing 
activity by a moderate 15 percent last month the government said 
wednesday 
the commerce department said new homes and apartments were built 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 145 million units in 
september the fourth consecutive month that starts have held 
steady between a rate of 143 million and 148 million units 
weve had fairly stable interest rates and an economy that 
continues to grow at a moderate pace as a result we have had 
about the same rate of housing activity for the past four months 
said mark obrinsky an economist with the us league of savings 
institutions 
economists have been expecting significant drops in housing 
activity this year as interest rates increased but the sector has 
held up somewhat better than anticipated 
the federal reserve as an inflationfighting measure began 
pushing up interest rates in late march but the rise has been 
fairly gradual and in the last two month rates have declined 
slightly 
according to the federal home loan mortgage corp 30year 
fixedrate mortgages hit a low of 984 percent in early spring 
climbed to 1071 percent in midaugust and by last week eased to 
1033 percent 
however david seiders chief economist of the national 
association of home builders said mortgage rates will begin 
climbing again this year dampening building activity 
were looking for rates to start going up again not long 
after election were looking for a percentage point increase from 
now until the middle of next year seiders said 
housing construction during the current economic expansion 
peaked at 181 million units in 1986 falling to 162 million units 
last year 
in the first nine months of this year starts are running 105 
percent behind the same period of last year on track for about 
145 million units by year end economists anticipate a further 
decline next year 
building permits a good indicator of future housing activity 
fell 44 percent in september to an annual rate of 140 million 
units after rising 31 percent in august 
singlefamily homes in september were built at an annual rate of 
105 million units down 23 percent from august 
however apartment construction shot up 132 percent to 403000 
units in august apartment construction had dipped 130 percent to 
the lowest levels since the end of the last recession in 1982 
apartment construction swings widely from month to month 
analysts say it has been depressed by high vacancy rates and the 
elimination of tax benefits in january 1987 
by region housing starts shot up 124 percent in the west to 
435000 units the highest since june 1987 starts also increased 
63 percent in the midwest to 254000 units and 39 percent in the 
northeast to 212000 however they fell 20 percent in the south 
to 552000 
seiders said builders are working overtime in california 
fearing the eventual imposition of growth limits by local 
governments in crowded southern counties in the state activity in 
the northeast despite the september increase has been cooling 
this year from an earlier boom he said 
obrinsky said housing activity will likely pick up in 
manufacturing areas of the midwest where the regional economy is 
being powered by a surge in export sales however the summer 
drought has hurt farming areas in the midwest 
activity in the south has been hurt by high vacancy rates in 
texas and other oildependent states in the southwest he said
