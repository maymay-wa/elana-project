the captain of the uss iowa and three 
subordinates were charged with dereliction of duty for violating 
administrative procedures aboard the battleship on which 47 men 
were killed in an explosion the navy said wednesday 
the actions against the four men ranging from administrative 
corrective measures to punitive letters of admonition resulted 
from admirals mast hearings conducted earlier this week on board 
the iowa in the mediterranean by vice adm joseph s donnell iii 
none of the men was relieved of his duties 
each person was charged with a dereliction of duty under the 
uniform code of military justice as a result of administrative 
deficiencies found in the uss iowa investigation the navy said 
despite violations of procedure the navy said none of the 
discrepancies resulted in or contributed to the explosion on 
april 19 
a navy investigation concluded that gunners mate clayton 
hartwig most likely caused the explosion in the battleships 
no 2 gun turret by inserting a detonator between two powder bags 
the report which has come under congressional scrutiny turned 
up numerous lax procedures including experimentation with 
extrastrength gunpower and projectile loads the navy said those 
allegations prompted the admirals mast hearings 
as a result of the hearings capt fred p moosally commander 
of the battleship and the only man publicly identified by the 
service and his operations officer cmdr robert finney were 
subject to administrative corrective measures the navy said 
navy sources identified finney and the other two men cited in 
hearings 
a navy source speaking on condition of anonymity said moosally 
and finney will not have letters that affect their potential 
promotions placed in their files although they will be given the 
letters 
however the source said their annual fitness reports will 
reflect the problems on the iowa and their careers are likely to be 
damaged 
stiffer disciplinary action was given to the weapons officer and 
the fire control gunner who were given punitive letters of 
admonition the weapons officer was fined 2000 and the gunner 
1000 but the fines were forgiven 
the weapons control officer has been identified as cmdr robert 
j kissinger while the gunner was master chief petty officer 
stephen skelly 
the service said the action against moosally was less severe 
because subordinates were held accountable for deficiencies in 
their specifically assigned duties 
kathy kubicina of cleveland hartwigs sister said she was not 
surprised by the navy action 
they got merely a slap on the wrists if they would have 
gotten something harsher the navy would have had to admit their 
own guilt i was prepared for this which is absolutely nothing 
she said 
donnell based his punishment on what he concluded was 
appropriate for each person the navy said insisting that the 
administrative deficiencies had nothing to do with the explosion 
it should be stressed that although deficiencies in the iowas 
training documentation weapons handling requirements and adherence 
to safety procedures were found within the weapons department the 
investigation determined that these shortcomings did not cause or 
contribute to the explosion the navy said in a statement 
in deciding on the punishments donnell was required to 
separate the larger tragedy from the process of determining 
accountability for administrative training safety and 
ordnancehandling deficiencies the navy said 
all four men can appeal for a review of the actions

one of two men who bombed three abortion 
facilities here on christmas day 1984 is free and the other is 
scheduled to be paroled next month federal officials said 
wednesday 
james simmons and matthew goldsby both 26 and from the 
cantonment community north of pensacola have served about half of 
the 10year prison sentences they received for the christmas day 
bombings 
the bombings in this florida panhandle city followed by three 
more in the washington dc area the next week refocused 
national attention on the abortion issue 
simmons was transferred from the tallahassee federal 
correctional institution to a workrelease program in pensacola a 
couple months ago 
he was released from there 59 days early on sept 25 under the 
federal curfew parole program said tom kowalski regional 
administrator for the us parole commission in atlanta 
although free he must observe a curfew until his regular parole 
date of nov 28 kowalski said 
goldsby is scheduled for release nov 21 his initial release 
date was may 21 1990 but george rast the regional parole 
commissioner moved it up two years ago because goldsby was 
credited with superior program achievement which could include 
good conduct work performance and educational advancement 
simmons a glass company employee and goldsby a construction 
worker were convicted of planting homemade pipe bombs at a clinic 
and two doctors offices where abortions were performed the 
building in which one office was located was demolished by the 
explosion and ensuing fire and the other office was seriously 
damaged 
damage at the clinic the ladies center was less severe and it 
soon reopened becoming the target of numerous antiabortion 
demonstrations 
one doctor at the bombedout clinic retired and the other 
discontinued abortions because insurance companies refused to cover 
his new office fearing it also might be attacked as long as he 
continued that part of his practice 
simmons wife kathren and goldsbys former fiance kay 
wiggins were convicted on conspiracy charges and placed on 
probation 
all four had attended the first assembly of god church in 
pensacola and said the two men were driven by religious conviction 
feminist leaders criticized the sentences are being too lenient 
to begin with the terms were the shortest given to people 
convicted of bombing or torching abortion clinics up to that time 
the case drew wide public attention when it went to trial in 
april 1985 with defense lawyers portraying their clients as 
idealistic knights in shining armor or tom sawyer and huck

thousands of ethnic turks line up daily 
at the turkish embassy in sofia besieging officials for visas to 
enter turkey but about 20000 who got visas in past months have 
come back unable to find good jobs or housing in turkey 
the turks have been fleeing a sometimesviolent campaign by 
bulgarian authorities going back to 1984 to force them to use 
bulgarian names curtail their moslem religious rites and stop 
speaking turkish in public 
diplomats in sofia say many of the turks who have returned face 
prosecution although they have no details of such cases they also 
say the turks often are forbidden to return to their previous jobs 
and homes partly due to an acute labor shortage in some areas that 
has prompted authorities to shift manual labor to crucial 
construction projects and industries 
the official bulgarian news agency bta has reported the return 
rate at 500 to 1000 a day 
a turkish diplomat in sofia said however that ethnic turks 
still want to leave bulgaria as vigorously as before 
you can see for yourself there are some 2000 people waiting 
around our consulate every day he said 
about 320000 of bulgarias 15 million ethnic turks began in 
midyear to leave for turkey bulgaria deported some of them 
others emigrated under new liberalized passport regulations many 
had their possessions seized before leaving and their arrival 
strained turkish abilities to absorb them 
on aug 22 premier turgut ozal of turkey closed the border to 
the ethnic turks requiring them to obtain regular visas his move 
part of an attempt to persuade bulgaria to safeguard the property 
of those seeking to settle in turkey was widely seen as a 
diplomatic victory for bulgarias communist government over turkey 
which had asserted at one point that it would welcome any bulgarian 
turk facing persecution 
now that turkey is no longer absorbing large new groups of 
ethnic turks the situation of people wanting to emigrate has 
become even more precarious about 25000 wouldbe emigrants are 
stranded in bulgaria most have sold their houses and other 
belongings 
a turkish diplomat said his mission now is to issue visas only 
for family reunification and other urgent case 
in all we are interviewing about 800 people a day he said 
only a handful perhaps a dozen or so receive visas each day 
with the numbers we have given out for visa applicants we are 
already in the mid1990s he said of a waiting list for 
interviews 
long lines reportedly also have formed outside the turkish 
consulates in varna on the black sea and the southern industrial 
town of plovdiv 
several diplomats in sofia asserted that 500000 more ethnic 
turks may want to emigrate to turkey 
but bulgaria continues to balk at a new emigration accord with 
turkey that would set out in detail such things as property rights 
and social security claims 
such a new immigration agreement would limit the free movement 
of our people under the helsinki accords on human rights said 
chavdar mladenov of the foreign ministry bulgaria has come under 
heavy western criticism over the issue 
officially bulgaria has stopped referring to a turkish minority 
in the country officials and newspapers now invariably speak of 
bulgarian moslems 
maldenov asserted flatly that there are no turks in bulgaria 
turks indeed have left some of the villages in the razgrad area 
270 miles northeast of sofia 
of 400 families 300 left for turkey said one of the 
handful of farmers in one village 
in mortagonovo another predominantly turkish village a frail 
man in his late 70s sat on a bench his prayer beads gliding 
through his fingers 
he was asked if he planned to leave 
i was waiting in a camp down south for 15 days then they 
closed the border he said in halting bulgarian i sold my 
house before i left now im staying with my son

prime minister margaret thatcher was asked over 
lunch with foreign journalists how shed run a political campaign 
against margaret thatcher 
her reply 
i wouldnt id vote for her 
this instant response on wednesday showed the british prime 
minister in full combative cry as she goes into the 198990 
political season with three consecutive election victories behind 
her and every indication she will go for a fourth 
autumn in britain means the annual party conventions where 
political leaders take stock of the year and promise victory next 
time 
mrs thatchers conservatives convene next week the opposition 
labor party is halfway through its convention buoyed by opinion 
poll leads and a conviction that after a decade of thatcherism the 
british are ready for a change 
mrs thatcher obviously disagrees but she does so with the zeal 
and enthusiasm of a firsttime candidate rather than a senior 
stateswoman who turns 64 this month and is the longestserving 
leader of a western democracy 
she has been to poland and talked to farmers who cant get 
permits for equipment to grow crops last month she was in siberia 
watching soviets selling vodka to her press party strictly for 
hard currency she had her sixth meeting with mikhail s gorbachev 
and was struck once again she says by the enormous risks of 
switching rapidly from communism to a free market 
her conclusion is characteristically simple there is no 
revision refashioning or reform of socialism that is possible 
theres only rejection of it 
this unwavering conviction that she is right is a thatcher 
hallmark and any suggestion of second thoughts is quickly slapped 
down 
lately attempts are being made to penetrate the thatcher 
mystique through longdistance psychoanalysis leo abse a former 
labor lawmaker has just published a 288page book whose central 
thesis is that mrs thatcher suffers from narcissism caused by an 
unloving mother 
on wednesday the independent newspaper said mrs thatcher plans 
to block her official residence with 10foothigh railings it said 
psychiatrists believed it was a sign of the stress caused by 10 
years at the helm 
mrs thatcher probably would scoff at such notions she believes 
she simply represents basic human instincts 
thatcherism is a lot older than me she said 
referring to britains bumpy passage into the brotherhood of 
european nations she said she merely wanted to make sure the 
european economic community followed thatcherite principles namely 
not to tie free enterprise down in bureaucracy 
because we approached the whole of europe in the same way as 
we do at home we dont wish it to be tied up with unnecessary 
regulations she said 
mrs thatcher likes to illustrate her points with mundane 
examples like the polish farmers last year she had asked them why 
they couldnt grow enough food they told her it was because of the 
difficulty in obtaining farming equipment from officials 
and then it suddenly dawned on me mrs thatcher said 
that it is the whole network of intricate controls which will 
stop people from being able to make maximum use of their property

a b1b bomber with 
crippled landing gear flew halfway across the continent wednesday 
and made a successful touchdown on the mojave desert lake bed where 
the space shuttle lands 
the 280 million aircraft with its fourmember crew unable to 
unlock its nose landing gear refueled in the air and landed at 
615 pm after 11 hours in the air that began as a training 
flight in texas 
the big bomber trailed a plume of dust as it rolled down the 
12milelong runway after touchdown slowly lowering onto its nose 
there were no injuries said tech sgt donn clarius a 
spokesman at edwards air force base the flight crew came out 
just fine 
there was no fire or explosion or anything 
he said the bomber suffered some damage which was being 
assessed by ground crews as darkness fell 
dale punter an aerospace buff who monitors military frequencies 
from his home in lancaster listened to radio traffic between the 
pilots and controllers 
just before touching down the pilot said its been a great 
day for flying except for a few glitches punter reported 
just after the landing punter said he heard the pilot say it 
was real nice structure looking good 
during the landing the massive bomber skidded on its nose for 
more than half a minute yet it did not break up no flames were 
seen 
its one of the safest areas to land said base spokeswoman 
dottie spiegelberg adding that the hard clay surface means there 
are no sparks and minimizes the chance of explosion or fire 
the aircraft flying out of dyess air force base in texas 
wasnt carrying bombs there are no nuclear weapons said lt 
anu sjaardema an edwards public affairs spokeswoman 
an 18unit disaster preparedness team was mobilized at edwards 
including explosives experts a mortuary services officer an 
environmental officer and fire department personnel the lieutenant 
said 
they route a lot of emergencies to our lake bed both military 
and civilian we have a team to respond to that all the time 
said sjaardema 
the flight crew was capt jeffrey k beene 30 aircraft 
commander of the 337th bombardment squadron at dyess capt vernon 
b benton 30 copilot capt robert h hendricks 31 offensive 
systems officer and lt col joseph g day 38 an instructor and 
offensive systems officer with the 338th combat crew training 
squadron 
the crippled plane was refueled by a tanker plane before flying 
to edwards about 1200 miles away 
the b1b with a maximum speed of 1000 mph and range of more 
than 7000 miles is 147 feet long and 137 feet wide when its 
swingwings are extended it weighs 477000 pounds when fully 
fueled and armed 
maj mary beth kilgore at dyess said the plane started circling 
dyess at about 930 am pdt it left for california five hours 
later 
mechanics from dyess and the planes manufacturer rockwell 
international worked with the planes crew to try get the nose 
gear down the planes rear wheels were down while it circled 
dyess located at the western edge of abilene a city of 100000 in 
west texas 
the plane took off from dyess at 638 am pdt on a training 
mission 
the plane was originally tested at edwards afb and ms kilgore 
said dyess officials believed someone there could figure out the 
problem 
dyess is one of four bases in the united states where b1 
bombers are stationed 
in march 1986 the variablesweep wings became stuck on the 
second production model of the b1b during a training flight out of 
dyess afb the pilots successfully made a highspeed landing at 
edwards when the wings were swept back the plane stopped after 
using 13000 feet of runway 
there have been three b1b crashes and the crash of a b1 
prototype the most recent crash was in november 1988 at ellsworth 
air force base in south dakota all four crew members ejected 
safely 
the three crashes left the air force with 97 of the b1b planes 
the first bomber added to strategic air command in about 25 years 
production has been completed for 205 billion the plane was 
killed by president carter in 1977 and resurrected by president 
reagan in 1981 
in february the gao said problems persist in performance of the 
plane range and payload and fuel leaks probably could not be 
corrected fixes could cost 400 million per aircraft if the air 
force decided to do them all the gao said

with his travels to africa and asia his 
peace initiatives and calls to forget the painful past pope john 
paul ii has made unprecedented openings to the moslem world 
but the road to dialogue is dotted with obstacles and the 
vatican is keeping a wary eye on challenges to the church in 
islamic countries 
over the past two decades and especially during john pauls 
11year pontificate the roman catholic church has sought to erase 
the image of medieval crusades fought in the name of faith 
moslems and christians have generally understood each other 
badly and sometimes in the past have exhausted each other in 
polemics and wars he said in morocco four years ago as the first 
pontiff to set foot on arab soil as an official state guest 
he said dialogue was essential between the catholic church and 
islam the two largest religious groups in the world 
but the spread of moslem fundamentalism has raised alarm 
especially for isolated minority communities of christians the 
danger of moslemchristian rivalries has been dramatized by the 
bloodshed in lebanon 
the popes concern over the lebanon fighting recently led him to 
make the first direct appeal by a pontiff to the islamic world 
saying there can be no winners in such a struggle 
he also repeated his desire to visit the country torn by 14 
years of civil war despite threats against him from moslem 
extremists 
on oct 9 john paul begins a visit to indonesia the worlds 
largest moslem country with an estimated 140 million moslems and a 
tiny roman catholic minority of 5 million he will be there until 
oct 14 
the pope has previously stopped in such predominantly islamic 
countries as turkey and bangladesh as well as several african 
countries with large moslem populations 
the era of dialogue was spurred by the second vatican council 
which also opened the way to improved relations between catholics 
and jews 
upon the moslems too the church looks with esteem said 
the 1965 declaration nostra aetate they adore one god living 
and enduring merciful and all powerful maker of heaven and earth 
and speaker to men 
vatican officials are pleased that its efforts have led to 
steppedup exchanges of visits between church representatives and 
moslem theologians 
the vatican also maintains diplomatic relations with a number of 
predominantly islamic countries including egypt iraq syria 
iran turkey and indonesia 
john pauls calls for a homeland for the palestinians have won 
him appreciation in the moslem world while his meetings with plo 
leader yasser arafat drew protests from israel a country with 
which the vatican has refused to establish formal diplomatic 
relations 
the church has generally been cautious to avoid offending moslem 
sensibilities officials note that on islamic issues it often has 
to deal with governments not religious leaders 
its something like the church in eastern europe where 
diplomacy is the best method we like to do things quietly said 
a vatican official speaking on the usual rule of anonymity 
during the height of the fury earlier this year over salman 
rushdies novel the satanic verses the vaticans newspaper 
said millions of moslems had found the novel offensive it 
condemned whatever is irreverent and blasphemous in the book 
but said the author should not be killed as the late iranian 
leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini demanded 
according to church surveys the amount of religious liberty and 
pluralism varies considerably in the moslem world 
in some cases the catholic minorities live in a state of 
tension and of concern at the possibility of new restrictions 
said fides a press service at the vaticans missionary office 
the vatican is worried about the spread of moslem fundamentalism 
in countries such as sudan ad in nigeria where rivalries between 
christians and moslems led to the burning of churches and mosques 
in the northern part of the country in 1987 
in an unusual public criticism the vatican in a major document 
on racism issued in february condemned the imposition of the 
sharia or islamic law on nonmoslems 
catholicisms fastest growing church is in africa but it is 
subject to special pressures 
during a visit to rwanda in 1982 libyan leader col moammar 
gadhafi declared africa is not christian and called for a holy 
war to help spread islam on the continent 
vatican officials consider indonesia a generally tolerant 
country but indonesian catholics say they are worried about a 
government bill presented to parliament that would give legal 
recognition to several hundred islamic courts 
religion and politics are also intertwined on east timor a 
former portuguese colony with a large catholic population forcibly 
annexed by indonesia in 1976 church officials report that a number 
of moslems have been converting to catholicism as a political 
statement of their opposition to indonesian rule

mikhail baryshnikov gave an exciting performance 
in american document at the opening night gala of the martha 
graham dance company 
baryshnikov danced as though born to the graham technique 
although his training is in ballet which is much different 
cecilia peck a student at the graham school and daughter of 
actor gregory peck narrated the dance a celebration of democracy 
which miss graham choreographed originally in 1938 and revised this 
year 
the 95yearold choreographer took bows with the company after 
the performance tuesday night at the city center and the audience 
responded with a standing ovation 
baryshnikov and maxine sherman danced the roles of an 
everyman couple who move through the history of america both 
were modest but eager stalwart and optimistic their duets from 
embattled through proud to beautifully romantic were a high point 
of american document 
in the original production the parts were danced by miss graham 
and erich hawkins 
joyce herring in red danced the counterpart to the narrator 
in revising the dance miss graham changed the chorus from the 
original all women to nine women and eight men she also integrated 
the speaking and dancing more smoothly and she changed the music 
american document is danced to from a score by ray green to 
concerto for oboe and orchestra by john corigliano 
bert lucarelli was oboe soloist and stanley sussman conducted 
the evening began with night chant from 1988 and ended with 
the rite of spring from 1984 both choreographed by miss graham 
the company will dance at the city center through oct 22

the uproar that surrounded the last temptation of christ at 
the box office was renewed when it hit cable television this week 
with some groups vowing to cancel subscriptions and others 
protesting local blackouts of the film 
several cable companies around the country refused to show the 
movie transmitted on the cinemax pay cable network prompting 
outcries of censorship while others broadcast disclaimers 
beforehand 
the movie portrays the life of jesus christ and includes scenes 
of a fantasy jesus entertains in the movie about being married to 
mary magdalen 
its boxoffice opening last year was followed by protests 
nationwide with some theaters canceling showings because of bomb 
threats 
in west memphis ark about 300 members of eight churches vowed 
to cancel their cable television subscriptions for six months after 
the movie was shown monday night on cinemax 
we know there are many other forms of what we would call 
sinful viewing but we feel the line must be drawn somewhere 
said the rev gary hair pastor of calvary baptist church we 
know that people are free to watch what they want and by the same 
token were free to make an appeal we believe the message of 
christ is being blasphemed 
cable companies across the country including at least three in 
arkansas and two in pennsylvania were blacking out the movie to 
their subscribers but the manager of american cablevision in west 
memphis said he refused to 
one we believe were not allowed to censor the programming 
under our contract with cinemax and two a basic first amendment 
reason we might not agree with what the movie has to say but 
were not going to censor it because one element of the community 
asks us to 
officials home box office the parent company of cinemax said 
they would have no comment on the controversy 
some of the protests were against the cable companies decision 
not to show the movie 
in jonesboro ark more than 30 people carried signs that 
stand up against censorship as they marched outside east 
arkansas cablevision man confused over his identity and purpose 
and subject to sexual temptation 
in wilkesbarre pa service electric displayed a message on a 
blue screen the management of service electric have decided not 
carry this film because of strong content objections voiced by 
various groups when the movie was initially released to theaters 
we do not believe it is responsible to offer a movie even on a 
paid channel which was not generally shown in general theaters 
because of sensitive content 
i went to vietnam to fight against this kind of thing said 
richard tattersall of wilkesbarre i came home and was taking my 
boots off to go to bed when i switched on the tv i dont even want 
to watch the thing im just angry theyre censoring it 
a 73yearold oklahoma man has sued multimedia cablevision for 
1 million for allegedly violating his constitutional rights by 
preempting the movie 
im a world war ii veteran and i treasure our constitution 
and all the provisions of it and i say if we dont protect it then 
we deserve to lose it felix olim said

horace g alexander a quaker who served as 
an intermediary between mahatma gandhi and the british government 
during indias struggle for freedom has died he was 100 
alexander died of natural causes saturday at crosslands 
retirement community in kennett square a suburb of philadelphia 
said his stepdaughter cecilia bradbeer sibinga 
gandhi once described alexander as british in nationality but 
indian in heart alexander was with gandhi in calcutta aug 15 
1947 when india gained its freedom from the united kingdom 
in 1984 india honored alexander for his contribution by 
awarding him one of the countrys highest decorations the padma 
bhushan award roughly translated as outstanding human being 
two years after his first wife olive garaham died in 1943 
alexander made his first visit to the united states he moved to 
swarthmore with his second wife rebecca biddle bradbeer in 1969 
in a 1984 interview alexander said he continued to believe in 
the nonviolent principles of gandhi 
i try to be hopeful about the future but it is rather 
difficult isnt it but there are a lot of people in the world who 
are trying to take nonviolence seriously so maybe in the course 
of time it will begin to affect national policy he said 
people have a great capacity for good things as well as evil 
things and i suppose each of us has to go on doing the little bit 
he can 
in addition to his stepdaughter and second wife alexander is 
survived by a son james biddle bradbeer

whats hot for 1990 try wet beer on the 
rocks new age radio shorter hair on women and longer hair and 
wider ties on men says the author of the american forecaster 
1990 
also hot says futurist kim long will be the smart toilet 
a japanese invention that checks a seated persons blood pressure 
pulse urine temperature and body weight and displays its findings 
on a builtin monitor 
new age radio took off so quickly that it is a major trend said 
long 
its been called musical wallpaper at its most disparaging 
its somewhere between jazz and soft rock and it has the potential 
to not offend a fairly wide proportion of the population he said 
wet beer a heavier brew served on the rocks will debut in 
1990 along with lowerproof liquor but lowalcohol beer will 
continue to founder long said

fearing they might miss the last 
train to the west hundreds of east germans scuffled with 
czechoslovak police to get to the west german embassy many 
refugees were injured 
the desperate struggle came hours before east germany sought to 
curb the exodus of refugees on tuesday banning its citizens from 
traveling to czechoslovakia without a visa 
however east germany also decided tuesday to permit the about 
10000 east germans around the embassy compound to emigrate to the 
west 
hundreds of east germans overturned a police barricade and 
scaled facades rooftops or a 6foot spiked fence in an effort to 
reach the crowded embassy compound which had been closed earlier 
tuesday 
police swung their nightsticks and clubbed like mad one 
czechoslovak witness reported many refugees were left 
bloodspattered 
more people from the waiting crowd surged toward where the 
beatings took place refugees quickly built a human ladder to 
help many clear the fence witnesses said 
some became caught on the fences sharp spikes while others 
jumped or fell headfirst to the ground some were later seen lying 
unconscious inside the compound the witnesses said 
outside the embassy families with small children were unable to 
get inside 
this is pandemonium said a red cross assistant handling 
injured refugees on the embassy grounds 
thousands of other east germans had packed into the embassy 
grounds earlier and red cross officials feared sanitation problems 
later tuesday young men were seen climbing the embassy facade 
from a truck refugees inside the compound pulled them in through 
windows 
the crowd of east germans flocking to the embassy continued to 
swell during the day more newcomers joined them after dark 
shivering in freezing weather as their promised departure by east 
german trains was delayed

housing secretary jack kemp is winning support 
in congress for much of his broad plan to curb political influence 
in distributing housing subsidies 
kemp on tuesday unveiled a 58point plan to clean up the 
department of housing and urban development which would eliminate 
spending at the secretarys discretion and impose new management 
and ethics regulations 
many past funding decisions were frankly based on political 
influence rather than merit kemp said under my stewardship 
no decisions will be made at hud for the political advantage or 
personal gain of any one person or of a political party 
kemp in announcing his program said he did not believe the 
appointment of a special prosecutor was necessary to investigate 
allegations of past influencepeddling at the agency 
kemps predecessor samuel r pierce jr and three of pierces 
former top assistants have refused to testify before congress 
citing their constitutional rights against selfincrimination 
rep tom lantos dcalif the chairman of a house subcommittee 
that is investigating fraud and mismanagement at hud during the 
reagan administration said he supported most of kemps plan 
i believe secretary kemp is on the right track lantos said 
after meeting with kemp 
but lantos said he was not ready to go along with kemps 
suggestion that there is no need for the section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program the program has been at the center of the 
hud scandals and lantos says it was plundered by political 
insiders during the reagan administration 
its extremely important we do not allow the scandal during 
the previous administration to drive us into giving up the 
goal which is to provide affordable safe healthy reasonable 
housing for tens of millions of american families lantos said 
lantos reluctance reflected the programs past support among 
congressional democrats although republicans have been accused of 
abusing the program under pierce the reagan administration had 
recommended the program be killed and it was congressional 
democrats who annually kept it alive 
kemps proposed changes range from regulatory and administrative 
steps he can take immediately to more complex changes that will 
require congressional approval 
many of the proposals mirror those in a largely ignored 1984 
general accounting office report to congress while others were 
molded after more recent proposals in congress and by kemp aides to 
limit the role of lobbyists and consultants in government funding 
decisions 
kemp proposed killing another program huds title x land 
development insurance citing use of the money to build upscale 
projects such as a condominiumgolf complex in california 
he said he was committed however to maintaining huds 
coinsurance program which has been the source of nearly 1 
billion in sour loans to date the program allows private lenders 
to approve hudinsured mortgages and was a major part of the reagan 
administrations efforts to contract federal work to private 
contractors 
the problem was not the idea kemp said the problem was 
in the implementation of the idea 
kemp barred from hud work one company drg funding corp which 
has had defaults on 709 million of the 11 billion in hudinsured 
loans it approved 
other highlights include 
appointment of a hud chief financial officer and a separate 
comptroller for its federal housing administration whose loan 
programs have been troubled by fraud and mismanagement believed to 
have cost more than 4 billion 
requiring all lobbyists and consultants who work on hud 
proposals to register with the department and disclose their fees 
which hud could deduct from any funding awards kemp asked congress 
to impose civil fines of up to 10000 for violations of the 
registration requirement he also proposed similar fines for hud 
employees who disclose funding decisions prior to public 
announcements 
publishing all hud funding decisions and waivers in the federal 
register many projects cited in the april audit received waivers 
allowing them to receive rent subsidies above hud limits 
allocating up to 100 million for monitoring hud housing and 
community development programs kemp said the department spends 
less than 25 million to track annual grants totaling nearly 10 
times that amount 
increasing the staff of the departments inspector general and 
granting the office the power to subpoena witnesses for its 
investigations

a leading hispanic group and the alcohol and 
tobacco industries are dismissing claims that beer cigarette and 
fastfood ads are jeopardizing latinos health 
the center for science in the public interest said in a 
publication called marketing disease to hispanics that latinos 
suffer from an increasing number of health problems related to 
drinking smoking and highfat fast foods 
the beer institute a trade association said tuesdays report 
had no scientific basis and rejected suggestions that the beer 
industry is promoting alcoholism among hispanics 
institute president james sanders said money contributed by the 
industry to the hispanic community benefits public health literacy 
and cultural programs as well as economic development 
problems of nutrition and substance abuse in the hispanic 
community are real and they deserve real action and real 
solutions sanders said taking down billboards and shuttering 
hamburger stands wont help these very real problems 
anheuserbusch spokesman jesse aguirre said his companys 
advertising promotes responsible beer drinking and discourages 
alcohol abuse he called the report irresponsible patronizing 
it assumes that hispanic american citizens cannot make sound 
educated consumer decisions just like other segments of the 
american public aguirre said 
walker merryman vice president of the tobacco institute a 
trade association for the cigarette industry agreed anybody who 
sees an advertisement for a product is capable of making a decision 
about whether to use it 
dr carlos molina a member of the centers board and president 
of the latino caucus of the american public health association 
said hispanic groups have been silent on the issue largely because 
they receive about 1 million a year from alcohol tobacco and 
junkfood companies 
that support muzzles our national leaders on vital health 
issues he said 
however the national council of la raza a leading nonprofit 
hispanic service organization with affiliates in 26 states 
rejected that conclusion susan herrera vice president of the 
council estimated the group gets 2 percent of its funding from 
beer or tobacco companies 
we dont feel compromised she said if we cant take 
peoples money and do what we need to do then we shouldnt have any 
business taking that money 
the council has been in the business of drug and alcohol abuse 
programs and were still operating them she said 
the report cites studies showing 
men of mexican heritage have a 40 percent higher risk of death 
due to cirrhosis of the liver than white men 
in colorado lung cancer rates among hispanic men increased 132 
percent between 1970 and 1980 compared with a 12 percent increase 
among white men in new mexico lung cancer deaths nearly tripled 
for hispanic men from 1958 to 1982 while doubling for white men 
obesity linked to adultonset diabetes among hispanic women 
over age 18 was about 25 percent more prevalent than among white 
women 
the report calls for higher excise taxes on alcoholic beverages 
and cigarettes a ban on cigarette vending machines and a ban on 
all alcoholic beverages and cigarette advertising that links those 
products with health and youthfulness 
the center for science in the public interest is a nonprofit 
organization that focuses on health and nutrition

the newspaper industry faced with a 
decline in readership must develop customer obsession to 
reverse the slide the president of the associated press managing 
editors told the apme convention 
readership surveys can be useful but they arent enough 
said paul janensch editor and general manager of the rockland 
journalnews in new york citys suburban rockland county ny 
surveys cant halt sliding readership unless the editor and the 
editors staff are fanatical about getting close to the community 
opening the annual apme convention on tuesday janensch said 
steadily declining readership confronts us with the most serious 
problem facing newspapers today and that it even hits markets 
where the economy is booming 
if you are lucky enough to be in a growing market and your 
circulation is going up you may think you dont have a problem 
he said 
wrong even where circulation is going up net newspaper 
penetration is going down there are no exceptions 
in 1967 about 73 percent of us adults said they read a 
newspaper every day he said last year the number was down to 
51 percent 
call it what you will customer obsession putting the reader 
first serving the constituents we must do it better janensch 
said i firmly believe that if we build a strong rapport with our 
communities we will prosper if we dont we will fade away 
while many are captivated by national news and bigname events 
most of americas newspapers survive by providing residents of the 
community with information they need in their daily lives he said 
is your newspaper first and foremost a local newspaper 
asked janensch do you care as much about the expansion of a 
local business as you do about the national trade deficit 
in addition to building community ties janensch said a 
newspapers staff must reflect the papers market 
does your staff at all levels reflect the racial and ethnic 
diversity of your target readership he asked the editors are 
about half of your staffers women do your staffers have roots in 
the community 
also as the convention opened a military historian dismissed 
suggestions that negative reporting of the vietnam war damaged the 
war effort accounts of the vietnam war often served as a warning 
flag for top commanders who often werent aware of problems in the 
field said william hammond a historian at the army center of 
military history in washington 
sometimes the commander high up the chain of command is the 
last one to find out anything hammond said 
in this case media coverage actually extended the vision of 
the commander and he was able to make a response that was very 
important to the overall goal of the american military in 
vietnam he added 
major stories that would have bruised the armys image went 
largely unreported including the persistent problems of the m16 
the primary infantry weapon used in the war he said 
far from aiding the war effort he said the lack of reporting 
left officials with little incentive to improve 
the press in vietnam did not pick up the story with any 
consistency hammond said what happened the military never 
had any kind of a prod to do much about repairing the weapon 
his book the military and the media stirred controversy when 
he said that overall news accounts of the vietnam war gave a 
better picture of that conflict than official reports

through a combination of cunning ruthlessness 
and oldfashioned good fortune panamas gen manuel antonio 
noriega has survived yet another challenge to his rule 
but whatever sense of triumph noriega felt tuesday after the 
defeat of a military uprising against him most experts believe he 
is weaker now than at any time since assuming the command of the 
defense forces more than six years ago 
the panamanian economy is a wreck noriegas base of support has 
never been narrower his diplomatic isolation is almost complete 
and he rules over one of the most alienated populations anywhere in 
the hemisphere 
noriega has won points among some panamanians by surviving the 
unrelenting hostility of the united states and among this group 
noriegas ability thus far to win the test of wills with washington 
may have left him standing taller than ever 
but how far can noriega continue to coast on his 
antiamericanism at some point it appears the combination of 
pressures against him eventually will oust him 
those pressures are formidable indeed in early 1988 after 
noriega deposed yet a second president in two years who showed an 
independent streak the reagan administration moved decisively 
against him 
it froze all panamanian assets in the united states withheld 
payments to the government relating to panama canal operations and 
imposed trade sanctions against the country all this has 
contributed to panamas impoverishment 
after a period in which the united states looked to noriega for 
help in its effort to bring down nicaraguas leftist government 
washington has since done virtually everything in its power to 
remove him short of invasion president bush insisted tuesday that 
the united states was not behind the antinoriega insurrection 
besides pinching him hard economically the administration has 
campaigned tirelessly against him internationally and tried to 
intimidate him by expanding the size of the us military 
establishment based in panama 
at a different level panamas image was sullied by the us 
drug trafficking indictments against noriega and was damaged even 
more by the elections in may when government authorities tossed out 
the returns rather than acknowledge the defeat of the pronoriega 
candidate for good measure government agents assaulted opposition 
candidates 10 days after the balloting 
even the organization of american states not known for taking 
decisive stands blamed noriega for the abuses surrounding the 
elections and called for a democratic transfer of power 
the oas effort has since been suspended but noriegas 
international acceptance appears to be at an alltime low the most 
recent blow occurred on sept 1 when the noriegacontrolled council 
of state named a noriega crony as president of panama it was the 
second time in 18 months that noriega engineered the appointment of 
a president with no visible qualifications for the job 
there is little support around the hemisphere for overt us 
military action against noriega after all there is no apparent 
danger to the operation of the canal and beyond that there is 
strong support in the hemisphere for the notion that outsiders 
should not intervene in the internal affairs of any nation 
but noriega is testing the patience of countries which are the 
most enthusiastic supporters of that principle even mexico whose 
president carlos salinas de gortari was with bush when word of 
the uprising in panama reached here tuesday is keeping its 
diplomatic distance from panama 
although mexico keeps an ambassador in panama city mexican 
officials have told us diplomats they intend to raise their 
concerns about noriegas continued rule with panamanian authorities

when it comes to manuel antonio noriega 
american presidents make no secret of their distaste 
ronald reagan said he wanted noriega out of there his 
administration indicted the panamanian strongman 
president bush said the will of the panamanian people should 
not be thwarted by this man and a handful of his doberman thugs 
he urged the panamanian people and defense forces to toss him out 
jimmy carter accused noriega of stealing last years election 
but simply walking away wasnt noriegas way 
just as he resisted other efforts to dislodge him noriega 
apparently succeeded in unhorsing tuesdays coup attempt by the 
very troops he commanded and who kept him in power 
all manner of ways had been tried to rid panama of noriega but 
they all had failed 
last year in february noriega was indicted in miami then 
tampa on drugrunning charges the united states wanted to bring 
him to trial but noriega remained 
the president of panama eric delvalle announced he had fired 
noriega who put him in office in the first place but it was 
delvalle who left fired by the national assembly 
every effort seemed to fail a coup by defense forces officers 
antinoriega marches an economic squeeze by the united states 
bargaining for noriegas departure 
nothing worked 
last may panama held elections it was clear that the 
opposition had won despite massive fraud but still noriega remained 
among the international observers was carter he said noriega 
was guilty of thievery and said the election tabulations he looked 
at were patently counterfeit 
bush said at the time that although noriega had ignored us 
demands for a year he would leave because there has been a 
massive voice of the people heard 
the president called on foreign leaders to urge gen noriega 
to honor the clear results of the election and told reporters 
i would like to think that he will heed the call of the people 
and that he would listen to the international outcry that is 
building and that he would step down from office 
in that case said bush the relations with the united states 
would improve dramatically and instantly 
it didnt happen that way 
the united states long looked the other way when it came to 
noriega the man with the pockmarked face called la pina the 
pineapple by his countrymen 
the panamanian people had for years heard rumors of what noriega 
was doing the rigged elections of 1984 the dealing in drugs the 
laundering of money 
but not until 1987 did they receive confirmation when col 
roberto diaz herrera noriegas no 2 man was fired and spilled 
the beans 
yes said diaz herrera noriega had fixed the election yes 
said diaz herrera noriega had sold visas and yes said diaz 
herrera noriega had engineered the murder of hugo spadafora whose 
headless torso was found in august 1985 stuffed in a canvas us 
mail bag 
until the former aide talked no one in the panamanian 
militarys tight inner circle had accused noriega of so much as 
fixing a traffic ticket 
but diaz herreras charges spawned the national civic crusade 
rebelling at the militarys heavy presence the crusade called a 
strike followed by mass protests and noriega sent soldiers and 
riot police to break up a mass rally 
the united states began paying attention when pronoriega forces 
attacked the us embassy splattering it with red paint the 
reagan administration suspended all military and economic aid 
then the following february came the indictments which 
accused noriega among other things of helping colombias notorious 
medellin cartel by providing safe airstrips for its cocaine 
shipments 
delvalle scorned by the opposition as a puppet ordered noriega 
dismissed but the strongman arranged for the legislative assembly 
to remove the president

gen manuel antonio noriega is a longstanding 
political albatross for president bush and tuesdays failed coup 
attempt in panama only prolongs the presidents burden 
bush just cant seem to get noriega from around his neck or 
from power in panama no matter what 
nothings changed our policy remains the same a 
disheartened white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters 
as he confirmed what had already been widely reported that the 
latest effort to oust noriega had failed 
the rollercoaster relationship between the united states and 
the panamanian strongman haunted bush as a candidate and the 
inability to wrest noriega from power plagues him as president 
while denying that tuesdays failed insurrection was some 
american operation bush had all but invited a coup 
in may he called on the panamanian people and defense forces to 
drive noriega and his doberman thugs from office 
yet noriega has resisted 2 years of us efforts to oust him 
survived two coup attempts and harsh us economic sanctions 
evaded drugdealing indictments and even emerged from an election 
that was in bushs words blatantly stolen 
at a succession of public appearances on tuesday bush was 
grimfaced and testy despite some early reports suggesting noriega 
had been overthrown reports that produced fleeting ebullience in 
some white house aides if not in the president 
bush insisted to reporters that the united states was not behind 
the coup attempt 
when told that the coup had failed the presidents reaction 
fitzwater related was subdued he said ok and went into another 
meeting 
as a presidential candidate bush then the vice president was 
attacked repeatedly by democrats for his relationship with noriega 
particularly regarding when he first learned of noriegas alleged 
involvement in drug trafficking 
noriega has had a history of assistance to the cia and covert 
support for the nicaraguan contras although the reagan 
administration became disenchanted with him in the mid1980s 
bush the former cia director insisted he knew nothing of the 
drug connection until noriegas indictment in february 1988 by two 
federal grand juries 
his denial came despite testimony by a former bush aide retired 
adm daniel murphy who told a senate subcommittee that bush was 
told in cia briefings as long ago as 1983 that noriega was 
suspected of drug moneylaundering 
bush continued to deny any advance knowledge of drug dealing by 
noriega as he does today 
in the spring of 1988 reports surfaced that the reagan 
administration was engaged in pleabargaining negotiations with a 
us proposal to drop charges in return for his relinquishing power 
bush tried to distance himself from the negotiations with 
noriega and in one of his few early breaks with reagan said he 
would not bargain with drug dealers at home or abroad 
still democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis told 
campaign audiences almost daily im not going to be making deals 
with a drugrunning panamanian dictator 
bush had little difficulty defeating dukakis ridding himself of 
noriega has proved far more difficult 
the reaganbush administrations considered a wide range of 
tactics to topple noriega allegedly including luring him to the 
dominican republic and kidnapping him before settling on economic 
sanctions that damaged panamas economy but barely inconvenienced 
noriega 
then as presidentelect bush said there must be no 
misunderstanding about our policy noriega must go 
as president in the aftermath of the violence that followed the 
may elections bush accused noriega stealing the vote and declared 
he would love to see noriega out of there right now 
but when asked tuesday night by reporters at a state dinner if 
he was disappointed now that such a coup had failed bushs 
response held none of his former bravado 
i want to see democracy in panama succeed he said simply

the house heads for a showdown today on 
whether to repeal catastrophic health insurance with architects of 
the yearold program conceding their highest expectation is to 
salvage a only small piece of it 
whatever the house vote and even backers admitted they 
expected a full repeal to prevail a final decision on the program 
must await negotiations with the senate later in the fall a house 
vote had been planned tuesday but it was delayed amid protracted 
debate on other bills 
there was heavy sentiment in the senate for repeal too but 
finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas was seeking 
consensus for saving at least the framework of the program which 
was the largest expansion of medicare since the great society 
program was created two decades ago 
the catch has been a bipartisan agreement last year that the 
cost of the expanded benefits must be born fully by the 33 million 
elderly and disabled people covered by medicare 
congress structured the increased fees so those in higher income 
brackets would pay a larger share in proportion to their tax 
liability up to a maximum of 800 this year 
but that financing feature generated a firestorm of protest and 
overshadowed the big expansion in benefits for hospitalization 
doctor bills and other costs 
the cry for repeal came mainly from three quarters 
retirees who complained their former employers were already 
giving them additional benefits they were being forced to purchase 
from medicare 
upperincome retirees who objected to having to pay a 
disproportionate share of the costs to make up for the modest 
4amonth assessment on the estimated 56 percent of medicare 
beneficiaries who dont have enough money to owe any income taxes 
those who complained that the program did not address the main 
need of elderly americans insurance for nursing homes and other 
longterm care 
with repeal or a massive rollback a virtual certainty 
congressional health policy leaders said they anticipate even 
greater difficulty in the future in winning support for expanded 
health programs for the elderly 
future programs are going to have to be more carefully 
considered house speaker thomas s foley told reporters tuesday 
formally called the medicare catastrophic coverage act the 
program was designed to protect the elderly and disabled from 
financial ruin in the event of a prolonged hospital stay or other 
high medical costs 
it would pay for unlimited hospitalization after a onceayear 
deductible of 560 in 1989 previously medicare charged a 
deductible for each hospital stay during a year and provided full 
payment of hospital bills only up to 59 days a year 
the plan also would cap starting jan 1 the amount that 
beneficiaries must pay for physician services and beginning jan 
1 1991 would phase in a new prescription drug benefit

the marine corps says a drill instructor is 
responsible for the slogan kill rape pillage burn used by a 
group of recruits during basic training at parris island sc 
this is not a normal occurrence and i would consider this an 
isolated incident capt jr mill public affairs officer at 
parris island said tuesday 
the investigation began after sen john mccain rariz 
received a photograph of a recently graduated platoon that showed 
recruits holding a sign with the slogan and a skull and crossbones 
another sign in the picture showed a naked woman 
mill said the signs were done in bad taste which represents 
neither the policy nor the philosophy of this command or the united 
states marine corps and we are taking corrective action concerning 
this situation 
he said the signs were made under the supervision and approval 
of a drill instructor 
the photograph identifies the drill instructor in charge as 
staff sgt kirkpatrick 
the public affairs office said there was a staff sgt brian 
kirkpatrick on the base there was no answer at kirkpatricks 
office phone tuesday 
its outrageous the marines ought to be ashamed said 
mccain a highly decorated retired navy captain who spent 5 years 
as a prisoner of war in north vietnam 
the 8x10 color formal photograph showed the men standing at 
attention on risers with the officers who trained them in the 
foreground the parents of one of the recruits sent mccain the 
photo monday 
as part of training recruits often make signs or pennants with 
designs and slogans but mill said the kill rape pillage 
burn slogan should not have been condoned 
recruits he said are schooled in a code of conduct that has 
strict rules about humane treatment of civilians the enemy and 
property 
i was in the service 22 years and never saw anything like 
this said mccain blaming the officers in charge it shows a 
lack of supervision we are paying those officers with taxpayers 
dollars we want them to be honorable fighting men 
after receiving the photograph mccain wrote to marine 
commandant gen alfred gray 
it is my feeling that the signs that the recruits are 
holding are inappropriate and do violate the values which americans 
expect their marines to carry with them in defense of the nation 
mccain wrote 
while platoon mottoes are important to motivation and morale 
in the boot camp environment the high standards of the marine 
corps demands a philosophy a set of values a dedication and a 
resolve with which the enclosed photograph is simply incompatible 
mccain asked gray to ensure that the commanders of the platoon 
in the photograph understand and embrace proper marine corps 
values 
mccain also asked gray to make sure the recruits in the 
photograph were contacted and that they understand why this type 
of conduct is inconsistent with the marine corps values and 
tradition

civil libertarians and members of the arts 
community seem to be accepting housepassed limitations on federal 
aid to obscene art as restrictions they can accept 
the house voted 38141 tuesday to send the senate a spending 
bill containing the guidelines after adopting them on a voice vote 
senate approval is expected this week and president bush is 
expected to sign the measure 
the restrictions are a retreat from a stricter ban that sen 
jesse helms rnc and other conservatives fought for over the 
last three months 
the language the house sent the senate worked out last week by 
housesenate negotiators bars the national endowment for the arts 
and the national endowment for the humanities from issuing grants 
for exhibitions they consider obscene 
included are works depicting sadomasochism homoeroticism 
sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts 
to deny financing endowment officials must also find a work 
lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value 
helms had sought to prohibit federal aid for obscene or indecent 
art and for works offensive to a religion ethnic group race age 
group or the disabled 
given the uproar and general mood these days probably the 
outcome is something we could live with geoffrey platt jr 
lobbyist for the american association of museums said tuesday 
when one melds together principle and politics here the 
ultimate result was gratifying said james f fitzpatrick 
president of the washington project for the arts 
fitzpatricks organization is among those that have exhibited 
one of the shows that sparked the conservative attempts to impose 
restrictions on federal arts assistance it included photographs 
by the late robert mapplethorpe of homosexual acts and of children 
in erotic poses 
the other show contained a photograph by andres serrano of a 
christ figure in a jar of urine 
first amendment lawyer floyd abrams and american civil liberties 
union attorney barry lynn said they believed the language is the 
first time government aid to art would be limited based on a works 
content 
but its a compromise and its a vast improvement over the 
initial language lynn said 
we reached an agreement that if i had my druthers id rather 
not have seen conceded rep sidney yates dill who led the 
bargaining for the opponents of helms proposal but concessions 
had to be made 
the restrictions would last one year while a newly created 
commission studies endowment procedures and considers if permanent 
standards should be imposed for federally supported art 
the nea and the institutions it supports should have higher 
standards than the local porno store said rep dana rohrabacher 
rcalif who lost a fight in july to eliminate the neas 170 
million budget 
the legislation also requires the nea to notify congress 30 days 
before issuing grants to the southeastern center for contemporary 
art in winstonsalem nc which showed the serrano picture and 
the institute for contemporary art at the university of 
pennsylvania which exhibited the mapplethorpe photographs 
jack duncan counsel to the american council for the arts 
called that provision a method of intimidation the nea spent 
45000 for the two exhibits 
many lawmakers had privately expressed a desire to adopt some 
restrictions fearing failure to do so would leave them vulnerable 
to election opponents accusing them of favoring pornography 
after the july fight on rohrabachers proposal the republican 
national committee sent press releases to the districts of 21 
democrats accusing them of supporting sexually explicit and 
antireligious works of art 
the nea is required by law to support materials that in the 
experts view foster excellence are reflective of exceptional 
talent and have significant literary scholarly cultural or 
artistic merit 
the 112 billion measure for the interior department cultural 
and other programs is for fiscal 1990 which began sunday 
the legislation also extends for another year a ban on the 
leasing of offshore tracts for oil and gas drilling imposes new 
restrictions on lobbyists who seek federal money for clients and 
allows lumber companies to cut timber on federally owned land in 
the northwest while protecting areas inhabited by the rare spotted 
owl

interior secretary manuel lujan wants federal 
parks free of throwaway plastic and styrofoam cups plates and 
utensils 
lujan told national park service officials this week he would 
like the concessionaires in the parks to ban all nonbiodegradable 
containers packages and utensils 
a spokesman said later that lujan would not object in some cases 
to an exception to the rule as long as the plastic items are 
disposed of through a recycling program 
most plastic utensils and containers made of polystyrene foam 
such as cups and fastfood containers are not biodegradable 
meaning that when buried in a landfill they dont disintegrate for 
perhaps hundreds of years 
environmentalists have complained that the widespread use of 
such products has added considerably to the problems of waste 
disposal as cities are running out of room for landfills 
californias yosemite national park already has curbed the use 
of such items substituting paper items and in some cases using a 
recycling program for plastic items 
this voluntary initiative modeled after the successful 
program implemented at yosemite will stress the desirability of 
utilizing reusable recyclable or degradable products lujan said 
in a memorandum to all interior department employees 
james ridenour director of the national park service is 
scheduled to discuss lujans proposal at a meeting later this week 
with about 300 concessionaires who operate everything from 
restaurants to snack shops at the parks according to an interior 
spokesman 
of the 350 million visitors to the parks each year half eat or 
drink from a container that is not biodegradable said park service 
spokesman george berklacy 
lujan who has been criticized by environmentalists for not 
being a good steward of the public lands told employees they 
should be role models in the area of waste recycling 
he also ordered the interior department cafeteria at the 
headquarters building in washington stop using whenever possible 
containers or utensils that are not biodegradable unless they can 
be recycled 
interior spokesman steve goldstein said that was a first among 
federal departments and agencies 
although this action may be only a small first step toward 
improving our environment lujan said in the memo we should 
set a public example 
hopefully by this action we will help foster a new 
environmental ethic aimed at conserving the vital natural resources 
which we have a duty to manage for all future generations

like any good american politician soviet 
defense minister dmitri yazov knew what to do when he finished his 
private talks in the oval office with president bush 
yazov strode out the west wing doors past the everpresent 
marine guard and marched right up to the bank of cameras and 
microphones in the driveway tuesday to offer a personal message of 
peace to the american people 
the soviet people are cherishing the best sentiments and 
feelings toward the americans said the burly beribboned general 
we were comrades at arms during the second world war and we 
succeeded in winning a great victory and now we have no grounds 
no reason whatsoever to go into confrontation against each 
other 
the soviet general is touring the united states as the guest of 
his american counterpart defense secretary dick cheney 
his meeting with bush was delayed for a halfhour as the 
president received an intelligence briefing from national security 
adviser brent scowcroft on the attempted coup in panama 
bush learned only after the 30minute session with yazov that 
gen manuel antonio noriegas forces apparently had prevailed 
reporters were allowed to witness the opening moments of bushs 
meeting with yazov and the president broke from his customary 
practice by fielding two questions about the coup bush 
emphatically denied it was some american operation 
the president asked yazov to pay my respects to president 
gorbachev and said recent talks with soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze were very fruitful 
we are satisfied weve got some problems still bush said 
but things are moving in the direction we wanted 
out on the driveway yazov gave a ringing endorsement of the 
ussoviet rapprochement 
the main point of my discussions with the us president was 
the question of arms control the question of reducing conventional 
armed forces and weapons and the question of promoting a 
relationship between our two militaries and our two nations 
asked if his meeting with bush had advanced the prospects for an 
arms pact yazov smiled and said well i dont think i could 
really assure success at the negotiations within half an hour 
but he added our negotiating teams are working in geneva i 
think we are moving forward step by step to the ultimate conclusion 
of agreements on the questions anyhow we are counting on 
progress 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said afterward that 
bush had reiterated his support for perestroika and expressed 
hope for early agreements on conventional forces in europe and on 
chemical weapons as well as nuclear arms 
yazov displayed no pique at being left to cool his heels in the 
cabinet room and then having events in panama intrude on the oval 
office meeting 
asked about noriega he replied diplomatically 
i am not prepared to talk on the issue because i am not aware 
of what happened in panama we have not talked about it at 
all 
yazov said he and cheney hoped to reach agreements on further 
steps to promote ussoviet military exchanges and a whole 
program designed to promote better understanding between our 
two militaries and between our peoples 
earlier cheney took yazov a civil war buff to see the 
gettysburg pa battlefield where union troops repulsed gen 
robert e lees confederate soldiers in a turning point of the war 
between the states 
yazovs itinerary included stops today at camp pendleton a 
marine training base in southern california luke air force base in 
arizona on thursday and fort bragg nc on friday he will 
return to the capital friday for a news conference with cheney

nine of 10 americans think the countrys 
traffic problems arent getting any better leading many people to 
alter their travel plans a survey said 
motorists freedom of mobility is being restricted by 
congested roads in all sections of this country and the problem is 
not just limited to major urban areas said kay aldous vice 
president for public and government affairs for the american 
automobile association 
many suburban roads also are being affected 
the second annual hassle index released tuesday was based 
on a nationwide survey of 1743 adults by the us travel data 
center in washington the results were discussed at a conference in 
hollywood of the travel association of america 
the study showed that 92 percent of drivers believe traffic is 
worse or hasnt improved since last year compared with 86 percent 
who felt that way in 1988 
nine percent said they wouldnt travel because of congestion 
the same as last year 
this has serious implications for the whole travel industry 
said jerry cheske a aaa spokesman 
fortyeight percent of motorists surveyed said local roads are 
more congested than a year ago and 44 percent said it was unchanged 
five percent said congestion has eased and the rest were 
undecided 
the biggest concerns about traffic were in the west and 
northeast where more than 95 percent of respondents said roads are 
as bad or worse than last year the figure for the southeast was 
only 86 percent 
the survey which gave no margin of error found that 83 percent 
of respondents who took a vacation trip 100 miles or more by car or 
planned to take one this year felt auto travel was worse or at 
least as bad up from 80 percent in 1988 
sixtyseven percent said they left earlier to avoid traffic up 
from 59 percent twentynine percent drove at least 10 miles out of 
their way the same as last year 
to ease traffic problems the aaa recommended the federal 
government release 10 billion in the highway trust fund to 
construct and improve roads particularly interstate bypasses 
around congested metropolitan areas 
the hassle index is compiled from aaas travel attitude 
monitor a report on auto and air transportation that will be 
released later this year

leaders of the national right to life 
committee say they are stepping up efforts to persuade state 
legislatures to restrict abortions 
david osteen executive director of the group on tuesday 
rejected claims by prochoice groups that their political strength 
has increased since the supreme court ruling last spring allowed 
greater leeway for state regulation of abortion 
osteen at a news conference concluding a twoday strategy 
conference said antiabortion candidates have won seven of 10 
special elections for state legislative seats since that ruling in 
a missouri case 
although some polls suggest majority support for abortions 
osteen argued that support is only for abortions under narrow 
circumstances 
most americans think abortion is wrong he said 
the group has prepared model bills that can be introduced by 
state lawmakers however it declined to release copies of the 
proposed state legislation 
leaders said the legislation would restrict abortions in a 
number of ways including as a form of birth control it also 
would call for parental consent in cases of minors seeking 
abortions detail a fathers rights in an abortion decision ban 
the use of public funds and ban abortion used for gender selection 
the broadest prohibition would involve abortions used for birth 
control a term that osteen contended describes the purpose behind 
93 percent of all abortions 
burke balch state legislative director of the organization 
said the group would focus on a handful of states where abortion 
could become an issue in legislatures during the remainder of 1989 
he said those states were pennsylvania michigan florida 
illinois texas and ohio might also be targeted he said 
most state legislatures have already adjourned for the year

investors are prepared to help distribute an 
abortion pill in the united states if it becomes available the 
developer of the drug says 
they are ready to create a new company for distributing the 
drug in the united states and elsewhere if authorized said 
etienneemile baulieu 
but rousseluclaf the french company that holds the patent on 
the pill is refusing to license the pill for sale in the united 
states or to sell it here on its own he said 
the pill also would have to gain federal approval before it 
could be sold in this country 
baulieu a biochemistry professor at the university of paris 
school of medicine spoke in an interview tuesday after addressing 
an american medical association science reporters conference 
he did not name the investors interested in the pill which is 
called ru 486 
baulieu also said he believes that his winning of a major 
medical award last week should help prospects for the pills 
introduction to the united states 
legislators judges and others will consider that the opinion 
of such a prestigious award jury gives additional credibility to 
the use of such a compound he said 
americans who are confident in the progress of science with 
conscience will find ways to have it distributed here he 
said 
baulieu won the albert lasker clinical medical research award 
for his work on hormones and for developing ru 486 antiabortion 
activists criticized the lasker jurys decision 
in the interview baulieu said he believed the award might help 
persuade rousseluclaf to allow american distribution and help 
promote american public support for its use which he called a key 
factor in its chance for distribution 
in france baulieu said the pill has been given to 25000 women 
with a 96 percent success rate the pill makes the uterus expel the 
embryo 
baulieu said the pill can save the lives of some 200000 women a 
year who die from botched abortions around the world 
the pill which should be taken under medical supervision also 
can give more privacy to the decision of pregnancy 
interruption he said

the drug crackdown and a us supreme court 
decision allowing prosecutors to seize money and property earmarked 
for attorneys fees may chase some of the nations top defense 
lawyers out of criminal law 
racketeering laws they complain give the government so much 
power to confiscate assets that the sixth amendment right to choose 
ones own attorney may effectively vanish because suspects are left 
penniless before trial 
in june the high court approved that power ruling 54 that 
prosecutors may even seize assets set aside to pay an attorney 
the power applies to all racketeering suspects not just accused 
drug traffickers said neal sonnett president of the 15000member 
national association of criminal defense lawyers 
in this hysteria of getting tough on crime there seems to be 
a feeling that its ok for the war on crime to become a war on the 
constitution he said 
the association has made it a policy to help attorneys who are 
targeted by aggressive prosecutors sonnett said but many defense 
lawyers are discouraged 
i have received communications from attorneys who are 
articulating severe gloom several of whom are saying they may 
leave the practice he said 
one who abandoned criminal law was miami attorney joel 
hirschorn who left private practice after 22 years and joined a 
firm to try civil law 
whats going on here is that government every time i tweak 
its nose can go after my fees hirschorn said prosecutors 
have the right to shut off the cash flow and i have mortgages to 
pay 
but miami us attorney dexter lehtinen said seizure destroys 
the profit motive and can break up a drug ring more effectively 
than jail sentences he said lawyers have no right to argue they 
are somehow exempt from the law 
it was very important that the supreme court ruled that 
defense lawyers are not under a different standard he said 
lehtinen said that in his district no lawyer need fear 
prosecutors going after fees unless the attorney has taken an 
active part in laundering drug money 
but some attorneys said the threat of seizure is abused in other 
districts 
they may start with the drug dealers but they are going to go 
all the way down said jose quinon who defended medellin cartel 
boss carlos lehder rivas last year 
the final result is that the adversarial system as we have 
known it is gone the government will choose your lawyer said 
quinon president of the florida association of criminal defense 
lawyers 
defense attorneys already face the difficult determination of 
whether prosecutors will freeze their clients assets in many 
cases the line between legally and illegally obtained assets is 
impossible to draw they say 
edward shohat who also worked on the lehder case said trying 
to figure out prosecutors intentions is almost impossible 
there is no pattern to it shohat said ive had cases 
where you would have thought they would act but there was no 
seizure while in other cases you wonder why they did 
that means that a defense lawyer must first spend his time and 
his clients money just defending his fee instead of preparing a 
criminal defense 
joseph beeler who participated in the supreme court case that 
led to the ruling said prosecutors use of seizure to scare off 
lawyers a use of the racketeer influenced corrupt organizations 
act that congress never intended 
on a personal level beeler said ive certainly turned down 
business and i hate to do it because the government has made it 
impossible for them to defend themselves 
one result of private attorneys balking at taking criminal cases 
will be an increasing load on already overworked public defenders 
said robyn blumner executive director of the american civil 
liberties union of florida 
sonnett said attorneys have been sounding out congress about an 
exemption for attorneys fees but he acknowledges the political 
climate makes it difficult for congress to appear as if somehow 
supporting drug dealers 
for now many lawyers say they will continue their criminal 
practice but the days of an elite group of top criminal attorneys 
may be numbered 
in the next couple of years you will see some of the best and 
the brightest leaving criminal practice quinon said people 
are already beginning to handle civil cases that was unthinkable a 
short while ago

the army twice blocked journalists from meeting 
palestinians and a leading palestinian activist called the actions 
signs that israel is losing its battle against the 21monthold 
uprising 
also tuesday debate intensified in prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs coalition government over whether to accept egypts offer 
to arrange peace talks israels two main parties headed for a 
possible showdown at an inner cabinet meeting thursday 
the army on tuesday barred palestinian activists from holding a 
news conference in predominantly arab east jerusalem and halted a 
unsponsored press tour of palestinian refugee camps in the 
occupied west bank 
palestinian activist faisal husseini told reporters at a police 
barricade that by banning the news conference israel was showing 
that it is failing in efforts to quell the uprising against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
we believe that we can win and what you are seeing now it is 
the signs of the beginning of the end of the occupation he said 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek complained about the closure on 
israel radio saying they did not ask us did not inform us of 
the reasons i think this arrangement is wrong and i plan to 
clarify that with the chief of command the question is whether it 
could be justified by security reasons because its becoming a 
routine and this is not good 
police showed reporters an order issued by maj gen yitzhak 
mordechai of the armys central command declaring the scene of a 
news conference a closed military area 
the news conference had been called to protest an army crackdown 
on the christian town of beit sahour which has mounted a civil 
disobedience campaign refusing to pay taxes and boycotting israeli 
products 
olivier rafowitz a spokesman for the armyrun west bank 
government said the army would this week begin auctioning goods 
confiscated in tax raids on beit sahour about 500000 worth of 
televisions cars and furniture have reportedly been seized 
about 45 foreign reporters and photographers traveling in a un 
bus were turned back by the army at a west bank checkpoint while 
hundreds of private vehicles were allowed to pass including those 
of jewish settlers carrying weapons 
a statement issued by the army spokesmans office in tel aviv 
criticized the un relief and works agency for failing to 
coordinate the visit in advance and said the army feared the 
presence of journalists would incite violence 
more than 580 palestinians have died in clashes with soldiers 
and israeli civilians during the uprising forty israelis have been 
slain at least 123 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
as suspected collaborators 
differences in the coalition cabinet focus on shamirs 
objections to a palestinian delegation for peace talks that would 
include deported propalestine liberation organization activists 
the talks would be over holding elections in the occupied 
territories 
the united states and israels leftleaning labor party favor 
the proposed cairo talks but shamirs likud bloc fears that any 
meeting with the expatriate palestinians would be seen as implicit 
recognition of plo demands for the right of 5 million palestinians 
to return to land that is now part of israel 
yossi benaharon a shamir aide suggested a compromise may be 
possible under which egypt israel and the united states would 
convene for exploratory talks on the composition of a palestinian 
delegation 
president bush on monday told shamir that he was willing to try 
to arrange a summit with president hosni mubarak of egypt

the union representing 57000 boeing co 
employees went on strike early wednesday in its first strike 
against the worlds largest aerospace company in 12 years 
machinist union members in seattle portland ore wichita 
kan and elsewhere began the walkout at 1201 am local time 
union officials said 
in seattle on tuesday the union overwhelmingly rejected what 
boeing said would be its final contract offer 
union leaders had said they would notify a federal mediator who 
joined negotiations last weekend that they would be willing to 
consider resuming negotiations 
but tom baker president of the machinists district lodge 751 
said the union would not be in favor of extending the midnight 
strike deadline 
boeing issued a statement several hours after the strike vote 
expressing disappointment but vowing to continue operations with 
supervisors and nonstriking workers 
our airline customers have been notified of a strike and our 
intention to support deliveries to the best of our ability the 
boeing statement said it is impossible to make a general 
statement on all defense and space programs since they are at 
various stages of development and production 
baker said the main reason for the strike vote was a feeling 
that boeing workers deserved a greater share of the companys 
record prosperity 
boeing the worlds largest commercial airplane builder is 
enjoying its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders with 
carriers and leasing companies ordering 736 planes worth 385 
billion so far this year 
we have gone through the hard times with this company baker 
said we just want to go through the good times with them as well 
as the hard times boeing offered an immediate raise of 4 
percent with 3 percent raises in 1990 and 1991 the proposed 
threeyear contract also contained annual bonuses of 8 percent of a 
workers gross earnings this year and 3 percent the next insurance 
improvements and reduced compulsory overtime requirements to 160 
hours a quarter 
workers filling more than half of the 65000seat kingdome 
jeered the offer and folded summaries of it into paper airplanes 
that sailed through the stadium 
boeing machinists voting in seattle wichita portland and 
elsewhere were asked to decide whether to accept the contract a 
simple majority vote and whether to strike which requires a 
twothirds majority of members voting 
union leaders told the machinists who last struck boeing in 
1977 for two months the time was right to demand more 
if you arent tough enough to secure a decent contract this 
time youll never get one said justin ostro general union vice 
president and bargaining coordinator 
if you turn tail and run dont come back in three years 
expecting great change he added there is no good time to 
strike there is only the right time 
though pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business one 
division boeing commercial airplanes has a backlog of nearly 
1600 jets worth about 70 billion and deliveries extending well 
into the mid1990s 
for 1988 profits were 614 million on 1696 billion in sales 
boeing also is holding 366 billion in cash and shortterm notes 
baker said a strike could last a week it could be months

the house is trying once again to write a 
fairness doctrine to require broadcasters to air opposing 
viewpoints on controversial issues 
on a 261162 vote tuesday the house refused to strip the 
fairness provision from a budget reconciliation bill 
rep edward markey dmass said opponents of the fairness 
doctrine had used the threat of a presidential veto as a red 
herring 
the threat of a veto does not exist said rep john dingell 
dmich who as chairman of the house energy and commerce committee 
has been the main backer of the move to codify 40yearold rules 
the federal communications commission abandoned in 1987 
the fcc said the doctrine violated the first amendment and no 
longer served the public interest in an era of numerous media 
voices 
congres wrote the doctrine into law last year but it was vetoed 
by president ronald reagan president bush has indicated he would 
follow suit if such a bill reached his desk but he hasnt said 
what he would do if it were contained in a reconciliation bill 
which contains bushs hardwon capital gains tax reduction 
the energy and commerce committee added the fairness doctrine 
provision to the reconciliation bill earlier this year giving the 
fcc new authority to impose fines on stations found to be violating 
the doctrine 
rep michael oxley rohio offered an amendment tuesday to 
delete the fairness doctrine from the reconciliation bill saying 
the committee added the civil fines only to make the provision 
germane to budget legislation 
oxley said the fcc never administered fines while the fairness 
doctrine was in effect from 1949 to 1987 and never sought the 
authority to do so 
what this amounts to is simply government intrusion on free 
speech and government micromanagement of the news oxley said 
but markey said the fairness doctrine would assure that 
broadcasters cover important community issues in a fair and 
balanced manner 
a senate fairness doctrine bill was approved in april by the 
commerce science and transportation committee but has not come to 
the floor for a vote 
if a fairness doctrine passes congress and bush signs it a 
supreme court test is likely based on what opponents say is the 
doctrines unconstitutional infringement on broadcasters rights 
a federal appeals court earlier this year ruled that the fcc had 
the authority to scrap the doctrine but the court sidestepped the 
issue of the doctrines constitutionality 
many broadcasters particularly smallstation owners oppose the 
fairness doctrine saying the threat of lawsuits is enough to make 
them just play music instead of discussing controversial issues

the disappearance of six children of dead 
polygamist leader ervil lebaron dims hopes of breaking two decades 
of religious violence in which more than 20 people were slain 
authorities say 
the six fled foster homes in salt lake city on friday and may be 
headed to a family hideout in mexico authorities said 
its sad said dave schwendiman assistant us attorney for 
utah who heads a lebaron crime family task force you think 
maybe you have a chance to stop the violence and give these kids a 
chance for a normal life and then it blows up on you 
the children were identified as norma lebaron 18 nikki 
lebaron 17 jessica lebaron 15 jerod lebaron 14 daniel 
lebaron 13 and joshua lebaron 12 
authorities believe lebarons eldest surviving son and clan 
patriarch andrew may have organized their escapes salt lake 
county attorneys investigator lt dick forbes said 
andrew 29 and brothers aaron 22 and heber 25 are believed 
to have led the clan in a recent series of killings that followed 
the practice of blood atonement preached by their father 
authorities said heber and aaron are in custody 
relatives believe the three brothers are executing a hit list 
written by their father who founded the violent church of the lamb 
of god and was convicted of ordering the 1977 slaying of a rival 
utah polygamist 
lebaron who had a dozen wives and fathered more than 50 
children died of a heart attack in 1981 at age 56 in the utah 
state prison authorities and relatives describe his book of new 
covenants written in prison as a blueprint for revenge against 
those lebaron believed abandoned him after his arrest 
the clan is a radical offshoot of the mormon church which now 
bans polygamy 
the six children were placed in foster homes after being 
subpoenaed along with other family members by the us attorneys 
office in salt lake city for a grand jury investigation into the 
oct 16 1987 killing of daniel ben jordan a colorado polygamist 
and former lebaron lieutenant 
authorities said the children refused to cooperate with the 
investigation out of fear of retribution from other family members 
the clan has been dealt a series of blows in the past two years 
with the arrests of more than a dozen members 
heber lebaron and four others are in prison in arizona 
convicted of operating a truck theft ring to finance the family 
heber also is wanted in houston for attempting to kill a guard in a 
credit union holdup 
aaron lebaron and two other members are being held in chicago on 
federal charges of possessing false identification papers 
andrew may have sought to gather remaining family members and 
regroup in mexico said forbes who has tracked the clan for more 
than a decade 
the three brothers remain suspects in the killings of three 
former lebaron followers and the daughter of one of the victims in 
houston and the dallas suburb of irving on june 27 1988 they also 
are suspects in the disappearance of former lebaron apostle leo p 
evoniuk near santa cruz calif in may 1987 
other members are in hiding believing they are on the hit list 
forbes said they include rena chynoweth a former wife of evril 
lebaron and her mother thelma who were trying to adopt the six 
youngsters when they disappeared 
renas brothers mark and duane chynoweth were killed in 
houston along with duanes 8yearold daughter jennifer 
they killed my brothers and my sister and my niece said 
glenn chynoweth renas brother who lives in sunset i wanted to 
break that chain so we dont have some up and coming young ones to 
be trained in violence

tens of thousands of people are arriving in

to lift the homeless from the streets and make housing more 
affordable for all americans 
organizers wouldnt say tuesday what turnout they expect for 
three days of activities culminating in a housing now march 
saturday on the national mall 
but the breadth of their sponsorship coupled with a massive 
planning effort dating to early in the year could produce one of 
the largest demonstrations washington has seen in years 
were saying enough is enough said washington homeless 
activist mitch snyder today the streets in boston new york and 
washington look like those in calcutta this demonstration is to 
provide some will and some backbone to the administration and 
congress 
activists complain the reaganbush administrations cut the 
budget authority for federal housing assistance programs by 77 
percent from 32 billion to less than 8 billion a year and

the health of a terminally ill defense 
department employee may have deteriorated too much to allow him to 
take advantage of offers from volunteers to fly him for free back 
to his massachusetts home 
the offers were made after the defense department refused a 
request from the wife of avram brody to fly him on an air force 
airambulance flight from palmdale calif 
amy brody said her husband a threeyear defense department 
computer operator wanted to return to massachusetts where he was 
born and raised so he could be among relatives and friends for the 
last weeks of his life 
brody 25 was diagnosed last year with terminal brain cancer 
it would have cost roughly 29000 to hire a private air ambulance 
air force officials refused a transcontinental flight even when 
congressmen and a white house aide were enlisted to help brody 
mrs brody said tuesday she did not know if her husbands 
condition might improve enough to make a flight offered by private 
citizens possible brody has already outlasted the life expectation 
given by doctors by several months

sen lloyd bentsen is asking the senate to 
reinstate a tax benefit for the natural gas industry that he says 
would result in hundreds of new wells being drilled in texas and 
thousands more across the country 
congressional joint committee on taxation estimates indicate the 
tax break would cost the us treasury 40 million in 1990 and 180 
million by 1994 
bentsen the chairman of the senate finance committee said the 
socalled tight sands tax credit is an incentive for producers 
willing to explore for natural gas in difficult geological 
formations such as the carthage valley in east texas and the cisco 
canyon area of west texas 
these formations contain small pockets of gas rather than the 
more common large pools which have been developed in prior years 
bentsen dtexas said tuesday these small pockets of gas are 
difficult to find and expensive to produce

gen manuel antonio noriega who once 
called his opponents bullets kisses is a shrewd and ruthless 
survivor who revels in power and in thumbing his nose at what he 
calls the colossus of the north 
on tuesday elements of the 15000man defense forces he 
commands claimed they had deposed him but once again he dodged 
the bullet and showed up tuesday afternoon to accept the rebels 
surrender 
it is known that tony noriega enjoys a crisis and events of 
the last 18 months would have driven a less determined man into 
retirement 
many panamanians want him out the united states which indicted 
him on drugtrafficking charges in february 1988 has tried 
everything short of military force to remove him the international 
community has condemned him 
but noriega who comes from el chorrillo the panama city 
district where defense forces headquarters is located has survived 
and created a mystique 
it is said he thrives on pressure and would prefer death to 
losing power that is part of machismo that won him the nickname 
the man the english word his initials spell 
noriega has wrapped himself in nationalism saying it is part of 
the historic mission of his generation to take control of the 
panama canal under an accord with the united states panama is to 
take over the canal by the year 2000 
during his last crisis in may after the opposition swamped his 
candidate in presidential elections that were annulled by the 
government noriega was seen standing alone before the tomb of his 
patron gen omar torrijos 
the epitaph on the tomb is i dont want to enter heaven i 
just want to enter the canal zone 
torrijos who seized power in a 1968 signed the 1977 accord 
with former president carter to turn over the canal torrijos was 
killed in a plane crash in 1981 and noriega became commander of 
the defense forces in 1983 the position has allowed him to control 
the government 
noriega says his enemies are fomenting a plot to abrogate the 
canal pact 
the general was raised by foster parents and joined the defense 
forces in 1962 his ascent began when he caught the attention of 
torrijos then an ambitious young officer 
in his climb to the top he dealt with everyone from the cia to 
colombian cocaine cartels 
less than a year after torrijos gained power in 1968 coup he 
made noriega then an obscure major chief of intelligence with the 
rank of lieutenant colonel 
it was like having the keys to the city noriega immediately 
began assembling dossiers on everyone who counted in panama 
noriegas job also put him in close contact with us 
intelligence agencies and he formed powerful alliances 
one us official who dealt with noriega at the time on drug 
enforcement efforts said noriega was polite but when it came to 
something he wanted he was the coldest man i ever met 
after noriega became the defense forces commander he acquired a 
fleet of expensive cars and a home in an exclusive neighborhood 
he reportedly is involved in a vast array of businesses 
including hotels casinos a television station radio stations 
maritime services dutyfree liquor stores and prostitution 
rumors about his personal life are plentiful but there are few 
facts even his age is in dispute the general says he is 51 but 
the date in his high school yearbook would make him 54 he is 
married and has a daughter who lives in the dominican republic 
although his private life is that of a rich man he worked hard 
to develop a populist image modeled on the revered torrijos 
spending weekends meeting with residents of towns and villages in 
this nation of 22 million 
noriega often speaks of his humble origins and characterizes his 
domestic opponents as rich and white 
the humble the poor and the blacks they are the utmost 
authority of the people he once said 
as the standoff with the united states dragged on in past 
months noriega enjoyed underlining washingtons helplessness 
despite the 12000 troops it has stationed in panama 
noriega exercises his power with ruthless assurance he has 
closed newspapers for months at a time and presidents served at 
his pleasure 
rumors of opposition inside the defense forces such as the 
march 16 1988 coup attempt were met with purges and 
reorganizations 
kisses was how he described the bullets fired in that 
attempted coup 
the united states long his ally began to distance itself after 
the headless body of one of his opponents hugo spadadora was 
found in a us mailbag in costa rica in 1985 
a full break came in february 1988 when two federal grand 
juries in florida indicted noriega on drugtrafficking and 
moneylaundering charges 
the domestic opposition began to intensify its campaign against 
noriega and washington imposed crippling economic sanctions 
noriega didnt budge 
shortly after the indictments in floria noriega delivered a 
speech he brandished a machete above his head then brought it 
crashing down on the podium 
not one step back he shouted

a tanker captain was sleepless 
distracted and had no lookout when his ship hit a reef and spilled 
289000 gallons of oil but he still should have avoided the 
accident a coast guard investigator says 
i think he knew where he was capt david h whitten said 
after listening to 2 hours of testimony tuesday from iakovos 
georgoudis captain of the world prodigy 
the ship hit a reef off newport on june 23 spilling the heating 
oil 
the captains workload contributed to the accident whitten 
said but you cant regulate that hes expected to handle 
distractions 
georgoudis told coast guard and national transportation safety 
board investigators he had been in control of the ship for 36 
hours catching at most two hours of sleep the morning before the 
accident georgoudis said he stayed on the bridge that long because 
of poor visibility which did not clear until that morning 
georgudis said he sent his chief officer below to do 
calculations for unloading the cargo at providence after the 
shipping agent messaged the greek tanker that there might be a 
second previously unscheduled stop 
georgoudis said that when the chief officer took longer than 
expected he called for a second officer to help him but the 
message apparently never was relayed 
he also said he had sent his lookout to help a harbor pilot 
board and was alone with a helmsman when the ship hit brenton reef 
i was everything at that point trying to handle radio 
traffic navigation and various calculations georgoudis said 
georgoudis said he saw a buoy warning of the reef about 30 
minutes before the accident but he could not explain the grounding 
thats my big question georgoudis said he said he noticed 
he was on the wrong side of the buoy only when the buoy was very 
near my bow 
the captain said he discovered only moments before the accident 
that he was northeast of where he was to have met the harbor pilot 
he said he heard no radio warnings from the pilot boat until the 
world prodigy hit the rocks at about 10 knots 
the captain acknowledged that ballard shipping co the tankers 
owner and greek regulations required a lookout when entering a 
harbor georgoudis said he had been in providence harbor once 
before in 1987 on a different ship 
defense lawyer peter dibiase refused to let georgoudis 43 
answer questions after the hearing and said the captain would 
return immediately to greece 
georgoudis agreed to testify after pleading guilty friday to one 
misdemeanor count of violating the federal clean water act and no 
contest to a state pollution charge he was fined 30500

prosecutors contended that ptl founder 
jim bakker solicited money for lifetime partnerships at his 
heritage usa retreat and used the money for his own benefit rather 
than for the lodging he promised the defense said bakker was a 
victim of circumstance a devout minister who was not blessed with 
good business sense 
here is a look at some key points raised by the prosecution and 
defense 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
prosecution bakker hid information from the ptl board of 
directors and did not give the board a true financial picture of 
ptls problems 
defense bakker said the board was aware of cash flow problems 
and voted to borrow funds to pay for them 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
prosecution the bakkers used ptl funds to support their lavish 
lifestyle receiving more than 3 million in bonuses in the 
mid1980s often during periods of financial trouble for the 
ministry when many ptl employees were laid off 
defense bakker said the board members voted for bonuses of 
their own free will adding that he accepted 31 million less 
than 1 percent of what he raised for the ministry 
 
prosecution bakker was creating a false sense of urgency in 
1984 when he told viewers that 50 percent of the 25000 
partnerships at heritage grand hotel were taken when computer 
records showed fewer than 4000 had been bought 
defense bakker said ptls computers typically ran six months 
behind 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
prosecution former top bakker aide david taggert testified that 
bakker had him relay instructions to divert lifetime partnership 
money to ptls general expenses 
defense bakker said taggert was lying 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
prosecution bakker fleeced followers by overselling lifetime 
partnerships lifetime partners paid 1000 for an annual 
guarantee of three night and four days at heritage usa 
defense partnerships were not sales transactions and the 
payments were gifts to the ministry the ministry had adequate 
facilities to handle more than 150000 partnerships already sold 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
prosecution called witnesses who said they were turned away 
when they tried to use their lodging benefits 
defense countered by calling to testify lifetime partners 
who said they never had trouble getting space in heritage usa 
facilities 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
prosecution backing the contention that bakker dipped into ptl 
funds for personal use former ptl executive richard dortch 
testified that bakker authorized a 265000 payoff in ptl funds to 
jessica hahn to keep her quiet about their sexual encounter 
defense a former builder for ptl roe messner who handled the 
payment to miss hahn testified that when he asked dortch if bakker 
knew about the payment dortch replied no im acting on my 
own

i was in an apartment building 
overlooking the defense forces headquarters trying to get a 
telephone line to report on the coup attempt against gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
after waiting half an hour i finally got a line but then there 
was a loud explosion people began screaming and throwing 
themselves onto the floor an old woman hugged her poodle the 
telephone line went dead 
about 100 yards away troops loyal to noriega had reached 
defense forces headquarters captured five hours earlier by 
dissident troops trying to oust him 
at 1230 pm tuesday they began exchanging fire with machine 
guns bazookas and mortars 
some loyalist troops were behind roadblocks along the normally 
busy street in front of the bayside barracks others advanced 
through a graveyard on one side of the barracks hiding behind the 
tombstones 
the shooting went on for half an hour and the sky filled with 
gunsmoke 
the sound of the battle was punctuated by a religious fanatic 
who kept crying sin no more christ is salvation 
residents who had not evacuated the crowded slum apartment 
buildings in the el chorrillo neighborhood screamed in panic some 
officers ordered them out but others told them not to go outside 
they didnt know what to do 
about 10 minutes after the battle began i looked out the window 
and saw a rocket crash into a nearby building shrieking people 
were running down the sidewalk 
then the shooting stopped one soldier was captured by loyalist 
troops on the street outside the long low wall that surrounds the 
defense headquarters compound 
they took away his weapon and stripped him almost naked before 
taking him inside hands on his head 
life slowly returned to the avenue of the martyrs 
chicha chichime cried a soft drink vendor peddling fruit 
drinks only an hour after the heavy firing had ended 
i looked to where the roadblocks had stood they had disappeared 
as if by magic there was still some shooting in the neighborhood 
however 
a few hours later noriega strolled down the bulletpocked steps

million package of aid for the struggling economies of poland and 
hungary 
the process of political and economic reform in poland and 
hungary has progressed considerably said the ministers of the 
12nation european community

economic difficulties they said in a statement issued tuesday at 
the end of daylong talks on foreign policy issues 
the aid package was unveiled last week as part of western 
efforts to help the eastern european countries reform their 
economies 
british foreign secretary john major said it was very 
desirable to help the two countries but said they must make 
economic reforms to sustain their societies 
the west wants to encourage the push in both countries for 
broader economic and political reforms

asked the european community to coordinate economic aid for poland 
and hungary they also urged emergency food shipments for poland 
at tuesdays meeting the foreign ministers endorsed a plan by

the 24 nations meet soon to ensure that sufficient momentum is 
maintained in the polandhungary push

the 100 million libel trial of pulitzer 
prizewinning journalist seymour hersh is nearing its end after a 
federal judge denied a defense motion to dismiss the case 
closing arguments were expected to begin this morning said 
michael nussbaum one of hershs attorneys 
on tuesday us district judge charles norgle denied a request 
to drop the case brought by former indian prime minister morarji 
desai the judge ruled that desais attorneys had presented enough 
evidence to allow the sixmember jury to decide the case 
desai contends hersh 52 libeled him in his 1983 book on former 
secretary of state henry kissinger the price of power hersh 
wrote that desai was a paid informant for the cia and a valuable 
asset to the us government during the johnson and nixon 
administrations 
to prove libel desais attorneys must convince the jury that 
hersh knowingly printed false negligent or malicious material 
about desai 
desai 94 is seeking 100 million in damages he is too ill to 
attend the trial however videotaped excerpts from his 81hour 
deposition were shown to the jury 
hersh testified that six high level us government sources 
told him desai was a cia asset 
kissinger testified monday that he didnt believe desai was a 
cia informant but under crossexamination by hershs attorneys he 
acknowledged he couldnt be sure of that because he wasnt told the 
names of the agencys informants 
hersh won his pulitzer for international reporting in 1970 for 
his coverage of the my lai massacre in vietnam 
desai a bitter political rival of the late indian prime 
minister indira gandhi headed the countrys government from 1977 
to 1979 
in his book hersh contends that desai supplied information to 
the united states because he opposed mrs gandhis policy of 
maintaining close ties with the soviet union and plans for the 1971 
invasion of pakistan

a second type of deadly aids virus has 
reached the west coast where it was found in a west african man 
who often failed to wear condoms when he had sex with 20 to 40 
women here since 1979 officials say 
this is the first case of hiv2 to our knowledge in the 
western united states said dr david ho director of the aids 
virology laboratory at cedarssinai medical center 
hiv2 or human immunodeficiency virus type 2 is common in 
west africa but very rare in the united states where almost all 
of more than 105000 aids cases were caused by the hiv1 type 
the infected man a los angeles resident who moved here from 
sierra leone in 1979 hasnt developed aids and chances are low 
that he infected his lovers said dr peter kerndt aids 
epidemiology director at los angeles countys department of health 
services 
until now only seven cases of hiv2 infection had been 
confirmed in the united states three in massachusetts and one each 
in connecticut rhode island florida and new jersey said dr 
thomas obrien an epidemiologist at the national centers for 
disease control three of those people developed aids 
six other people believed to be infected with hiv2 have been 
identified in new york state including five in new york city 
obrien said by phone from atlanta almost all the patients 
imported the virus from west africa he said 
kerndt said the hiv2infected los angeles man had 20 to 40 
sexual contacts since moving here but kerndt and ho said the 
possibility the man infected his partners is relatively low because 
he has low levels of hiv2 in his bloodstream 
the man whose identity was withheld had multiple unprotected 
sexual contacts over a long period of time with one woman kerndt 
said yet she has been tested and is not infected with the virus 
that is reassuring kerndt said 
a second woman also is uninfected but officials expect to 
locate only two or three more of the women kerndt said 
the man is in his 30s works fulltime and attends school 
parttime he has refrained from sex since learning three months 
ago he might be infected with hiv2 ho said 
this man is a pretty decent person he added hes had a 
couple of traceable contacts and they are negative aidsfree but 
he had multiple other nontraceable contacts onenight stands 
hes fully cooperative but he doesnt know these other women he 
had casual sex with he used condoms occasionally but on other 
occasions he didnt 
a private doctor referred the man to cedarssinai for aids 
testing but he wasnt hospitalized ho said 
hiv2 was first described in 1985 in west african prostitutes 
who had no symptoms then reported in 1986 in two west africans who 
suffered aids obrien said hiv1 and hiv2 both can cripple the 
bodys ability to fight disease leading to fatal infections and 
cancers 
obrien said that just because the second type of aids virus is 
appearing in the united states doesnt mean there is going to be 
a second epidemic hiv2 is very rare in this country and probably 
will remain so in relation to hiv1 
kerndt said the infected los angeles resident never donated 
blood has not used drugs intravenously nor has he engaged in 
any homosexual activity

a powerful bomb exploded in a congested 
shopping district of the capital today killing five people and 
injuring 13 police said two of the dead were young sisters 
the blast that rocked the sadar bazaar in northern new delhi 
apparently stemmed from a land feud that has been simmering between 
two families for more than a quarter century residents said 
four of the victims belonged to the family of abdul razak the 
65yearold operator of a motor scooter stand who owns the land 
his wife sister and two granddaughters ages 4 and 8 died in 
the blast the other victim was not immediately identified but 
authorities said he was probably a customer 
meedan bee the mother of the two children beat her chest as 
she repeatedly cried allah i lifted the bodies of my two 
daughters with my own hands one didnt even have a face 
the bomb was concealed in a plastic container wrapped in cloth 
and hidden under a wooden canopy where razaks relatives were 
sitting police said it exploded at about 1005 am they said 
it was terrible i saw ears limbs and necks strewn around 
said satish saxena a local politician who went to inspect the 
scene 
a bloodsoaked plastic doll that was partially burned lay at the 
end of the parking lot a canvas thatch over the scooter stand had 
come down the wooden canopy shattered into pieces was black 
a sobbing razak said the land dispute probably triggered the 
blast he said a neighboring shopkeeper has been trying to occupy 
the land and that the feud has been in court for 25 to 30 years 
police could not confirm the allegation but a senior official 
said we are investigating all angles 
todays explosion was the second to rock the capital in four 
months 
a powerful bomb exploded in the capitals main railroad station 
in june killing eight people and injuring 53 police blamed sikh 
militants demanding a separate homeland in northern punjab state

separate murder cases were hanged today at pretoria central prison 
raising to 42 the number of executions in south africa so far this

overtones although antiapartheid activists and human rights 
lawyers have been campaigning for a moratorium on all executions 
two mixedrace men were hanged on friday the first executions 
since midjuly and the first approved by president fw de klerk 
during his seven weeks in power one of them mangena jeffrey 
boesman was a member of the outlawed african national congress 
guerrilla movement and was hanged despite a clemency appeal from 
the united nations 
two of the prisoners hanged this year were white the rest black 
or mixedrace the number of executions is far lower than in 
previous years such as 1987 when a record 164 people were 
executed

an exnavy flier is under investigation in 
the bombing of a van driven by the wife of navy capt will rogers 
iii but said he isnt responsible for act the los angeles times 
reported today 
i didnt do it and i dont know who did it said h george 
marxmiller a commercial pilot for eastern airlines who now lives in 
lake oconee ga but they suspect i know who did it yet to 
think i would do something like this is utter nonsense its so out 
of character it doesnt compute 
the interview was conducted earlier this week in georgia the 
newspaper said 
as skipper of the uss vincennes rogers gave the july 1988 order 
to shoot down what turned out to be an iranian jetliner all 290 
people aboard the plane were killed 
rogers later was exonerated on grounds he had reason to believe 
his ship was under attack as it patrolled the persian gulf during 
the iraniraq war 
investigators originally believed the march 10 bombing of 
rogers van in san diego was done by terrorists in retaliation for 
the attack 
rogers wife sharon narrowly escaped injury when the pipe 
planted in the van exploded at a busy intersection 
federal investigators changed their thinking on the case when 
marxmillers name emerged the times said 
it reported that multiple sources had confirmed that marxmiller 
is now the leading individual under investigation in the case 
the special agent in charge of the fbi in san diego has refused 
to comment on the investigation 
marxmiller and rogers said they had met only once several years 
ago and that they had not seen each other since 
i dimly remember the guy rogers said i have no idea why 
he would be involved in this thing and i have no other comment 
marxmiller adamantly denied having a personal vendetta against 
rogers or a desire to hurt him or his family i dont have 
anything against the guy he said 
marxmiller said he had taken two polygraph tests since the 
summer and was asked whether he was involved in the bombing 
marxmiller said he believed he failed a question in the second 
test about whether he had planned the bombing or knew who placed 
the bomb under the van 
he said the fbi also has asked for his fingerprints and a 
photograph and has interviewed his brother extensively about their 
whereabouts around the time of the bombing 
fbi officials also seemed interested in the fact that rogers 
name is among three dozen people listed as witnesses on behalf of 
marxmillers wife rebecca who is suing for divorce in georgia 
according to the newspaper 
neither h george marxmiller nor rogers could explain why 
rogers name was listed as a witness

a small dog facing a death penalty for 
biting a man has been released after a judge ruled that even 
canines have constitutional rights 
marion county circuit judge richard d barber ruled tuesday that 
the dachshund terrier named blue two should go free after spending 
75 days at the humane society of willamette valley 
barber said the county has a right to confiscate a dog in the 
interest of public safety but that right cannot be exercised with 
total disregard of what we consider to be due process of law 
bob cannon the countys legal counsel predicted the ruling 
will prevent the county from enforcing state law in all future 
dogbite cases 
but the defense attorney for the dogs owners said the decision 
shows that county animal control ordinances need to be changed 
blue two obviously was not one of those dangerous dogs said 
attorney walter todd who represents vic and karen parkison 
karen parkison greeted her pet with tears in her eyes she said 
the dog had turned gray and lost weight 
im just happy and relieved to have him she said adding it 
was 75 long long days of waiting 
the dog had bitten a man july 13 the victim said he did not 
want the dog put to death but the county proceeded with a hearing

dr david baltimore a nobel prize winner who 
helped write a research paper that has been challenged as 
fraudulent has been offered the presidency of rockefeller 
university 
some very strong members of the faculty criticized the 
choice said richard m furlaud a cochairman of a committee of 
rockefeller university trustees that searched for a new president 
baltimore a 51yearold molecular biologist who shared the 1975 
nobel prize in medicine for cancer research has not been accused 
of wrongdoing in the paper 
he would succeed dr joshua lederberg as head of the graduate 
university which specializes in biomedical research and training 
lederberg will turn 65 years old the mandatory retirement age in 
may 
the national institutes of health and the house subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations were investigating charges that a 
paper signed by baltimore and five other authors was not supported 
by the data 
the research was done in a massachusetts institute of technology 
laboratory and not by baltimore 
since 1982 baltimore has directed the whitehead institute for 
biomedical research a private group in cambridge mass 
affiliated with mit 
we have looked very carefully into the whole nih investigation 
and the report of error in the paper and we are absolutely 
convinced that as far as he is concerned there is not a scintilla 
of evidence of fraud misconduct or anything else furlaud said 
baltimore said he planned to meet today with faculty members and 
planned several more visits in coming weeks however he said 
topics of discussion probably would not include the paper but 
rather where rockefeller is going to go what the needs of the 
university for science are for the next decade and whether they 
feel i can lead the institution in the right directions 
he said he had not decided whether to accept the position

more than 8000 people proclaiming 
themselves the voice of the unborn rallied at the capitol after a 
legislator introduced a measure that would impose broad 
restrictions on abortion in pennsylvania 
i was told last week it was a catholic issue i was told last 
week it was a womens issue i was told last week it was a 
biblebelt issue state rep gerard kosinski told the crowd 
referring to a smaller rally by prochoice activists a week earlier 
the bottom line is its a human issue 
earlier tuesday rep stephen freind unveiled a bill designed to 
challenge the 1973 us supreme court roe vs wade ruling that gave 
women the right to abortion 
among other things it would require a 24hour waiting period 
before an abortion ban all abortions after the 24th week of 
pregnancy except to save the womans life ban abortions used for 
choosing the sex of a child and require that a husband be notified 
before a woman has an abortion in most cases 
freinds bill backed by democratic gov robert p casey could 
be the first to be adopted in the nation since the high court in 
july endorsed missouris right to put more modest restrictions on 
abortions 
at a news conference freind said the bill could give the 
supreme court a chance to overturn roe 
later the republican lawmaker was cheered at the rally by about 
8500 people including activists from new york new jersey 
virginia and maryland they held signs saying the unborn need 
freedom too and pro choice means pro murder and closed the 
rally by launching red white and blue balloons 
maggie dalesio a philadelphia nurse who said she witnessed the 
death of an aborted fetus that lived for 90 minutes after the 
operation said one person can make a difference 
these unborn babies have no one but us to cry out for them 
she said let us make sure we are heard 
freinds bill has the support of more than 70 cosponsors some 
of whom joined him at the news conference and rally he said he 
expected his proposal to pass the general assembly and move to the 
governor by early next month 
also tuesday abortion rights advocates formally introduced 
their legislative package it includes a proposed constitutional 
amendment outlining a womans right to have an abortion 
the package also would restore government funding for poor women 
who have medically necessary abortions and weaken a state law 
requiring parental notification or a court order before a minor can 
obtain an abortion that provision is not in effect because it is 
being reviewed by a court 
in madison wis a legislative committee recommended approval 
of a measure to repeal an obsolete wisconsin law establishing 
prison penalties for women who have abortions and doctors who 
perform them 
on the other side of the issue florida gov bob martinez on 
tuesday proposed criminal penalties for individuals who operate 
abortion clinics without a license he also wants to give the state 
health department authority to close and fine clinics that are not 
in compliance

spent with hurt in beaufort sc during the winter of 198283 
while he was there filming the big chill a hit movie about a 
reunion of 1960sera college chums 
commonlaw marriages were abolished in 1933 in new york state 
where jennings and hurt lived but south carolina is one of 13 
states along with the district of columbia that recognize such 
unions 
silbermann of the trial level state supreme court ruled that 
although jennings lived with hurt and had a child with him living 
together did not constitute a marriage 
jennings met hurt in saratoga in 1981 when he was a 31yearold 
rising star and she a 24yearold dancer with the new york city 
ballet less than a year later she was pregnant 
the couple arrived in beaufort on oct 31 1982 and jennings 
contended that a commonlaw marriage existed between dec 9 when 
hurt learned mary beth hurt had divorced him and jan 10 when 
jennings and hurt left the state 
she said hurt resisted formalizing the union telling her they 
had a spiritual marriage and were married in the eyes of 
god 
jennings lawyer a richard golub said he would immediately 
appeal the decision claiming silbermann was madly in love with 
hurt 
let five judges who are all men decide this not one woman who 
is impressed by a movie star golub said 
silbermann last year presided over golubs divorce from actress 
marisa berenson a settlement he has said he was happy with 
silbermanns ruling in the hurtjennings case came about three 
months after a twoweek nonjury trial that was punctuated by 
angry outbursts and more than five years after jennings walked out 
on hurt 
in court and in impromptu corridor news conferences jennings 
said hurt was physically and emotionally abusive she told 
reporters hurt had beaten her spat on her and called her vulgar 
names 
silbermanns decision did not deal with financial support for 
jennings and the couples 6yearold son alexander devon hurt 
hurt pays 60000 to 65000 a year to jennings and the boy before 
the trial he refused to increase the amount and jennings 
petitioned for 16000 a month which silbermann rejected 
had the case gone in jennings favor she would have been 
entitled to a hearing and ruling on how much hurt should give her 
from his assets up to half of what he has earned since the time 
they were together 
in addition to the big chill hurt has starred in body 
heat children of a lesser god kiss of the spider woman 
broadcast news and the accidental tourist he won an oscar 
in 1986 for spider woman 
last march hurt married heidi henderson daughter of bandleader 
skitch henderson they had a son sam in august

new state rules requiring donors to sperm 
banks to undergo two aids tests and barring homsexual men and 
intravenous drug users from donating were welcomed by the director 
of one bank 
in order to minimize the risks of transmission and increase 
the safety to recipients we have to get some controls over who the 
sperm donors are said dr grace centola who runs a sperm bank 
at the university of rochester medical center 
the first question asked by patients seeking sperm from an 
anonymous donor is invariably about the danger of contracting 
acquired immune deficiency syndrom she said tuesday 
the regulations that took effect monday also require for the 
first time that sperm banks be licensed by the state 
donors are required to undergo two separate aids tests the 
second one six months after the sperm has been donated and frozen 
said mary anne gardineer health department associate director for 
regulatory affairs 
the regulations exclude a person from donating if hes had any 
homosexual activity intravenous drug use or sex with a person 
thought to be at high risk for aids since 1977 
the same people already are barred from donating blood 
gardineer said 
the us centers for disease control have documented no cases of 
transmission of the aids virus through donated sperm in the united 
states a spokesman said 
gardineer said theres been one case of an australian man who 
tested positive for the aids virus after donating sperm to eight 
women four of the women later tested positive for the virus but 
three of their babies born through artificial insemination were 
healthy gardineer said the fourth pregnancy never came to term 
aids is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread 
most often through sex needles or syringes shared by drug abusers 
infected blood and from pregnant women to their offspring 
new york states 25000 confirmed aids cases is about 
onequarter of the nations total 
geoffrey knox a spokesman for the gay mens health crisis said 
he had no problem with the prohibition against homosexual men 
in 1987 about 30000 women in the united states were 
impregnated through the use of anonymous donor sperm centola said 
gardineer couldnt be sure of just how many sperm banks there 
are in the state because they havent been licensed in the past 
the new rules dont apply in cases where a person is donating 
sperm for a specific person such as his wife

about 500 students angry at what they said were 
racist remarks by a history teacher rampaged at their high school 
and forced the administration to close it early police said 
one police officer was injured and four students were charged 
with disorderly conduct tuesday after the incident at eastern 
district high school in brooklyn 
about 100 police officers were summoned to help send students 
home when more than 1000 students milled in front of the building 
after officials closed it 
a policewoman was hit in the head with a thrown bottle and 
slightly injured police said 
they were kids and they were a little hot under the collar 
but by and large they were an easy group to deal with deputy 
chief thomas gallagher said 
nick gonzalez 16 david turpin 16 deshane smart 18 and a 
15yearold student whose identity was not released because of his 
age were charged with disorderly conduct gallagher said smart 
also was charged with resisting arrest 
damage in the school consisted of a couple of display cases 
that were broken and a few fluorescent light bulbs that were 
broken gallagher said 
the students were angry over a remark allegedly made by jeffrey 
goldstein a white socialstudies teacher 
noel kriftcher superintendent of brooklyn and staten island 
schools said goldstein told his class last thursday that american 
blacks while concerned about racism in south africa were less 
concerned about the plight of blacks in west african nations 
then he said something about blacks being backward in those 
countries kriftcher said 
the united federation of teachers released a statement by 
goldstein saying he lectured about atrocities committed by east 
african dictators on blacks and that no students objected at the 
time to the lesson 
students said goldstein used racial slurs when addressing 
students he always made racist remarks said nelta cajigas 17 
about 75 percent of the schools 3100 students are hispanic and 
22 percent are black said board of education spokesman frank 
sobrino 
about 50 students met with the schools principal in the 
auditorium tuesday to voice their dissatisfaction eventually the 
group grew to about 500 students who began rampaging through 
hallways breaking glass gallagher said 
schools chancellor bernard mecklowitz toured the school and 
directed that goldstein be reassigned to a district office pending 
an investigation sobrino said

a gunman ambushed and killed the leader 
of belgiums jewish community and authorities today were 
investigating whether the attack was antisemitic 
israels ambassador to belgium speculated that neonazis were 
behind the shooting of dr joseph wybran tuesday evening 
this was a terrorist attack there is no doubt about that 
said a police official on condition of anonymity he did not 
elaborate 
wybran 49 was shot in the head as he got into his car outside 
brussels university hospital where he headed the immunology 
department police said a hospital spokesman said he died early 
today 
no one has claimed responsibility for the slaying 
it is impossible to determine the precise motive for the 
shooting michael peytier a spokesman for the brussels 
prosecutors office told reporters but given the nature of his 
wybrans activities it cannot be excluded that this was a 
political attack 
prime minister wilfried martens in a statement called the act 
revolting and wretched and expressed his indignation at 
violence and intolerance 
in addition to heading the country jewish community wybran 
chaired of the belgian auschwitz committee the committee recently 
urged polands roman catholic primate cardinal jozef glemp to 
remove an order of carmelite nuns from a convent on the perimeter 
of the former auschwitz death camp in poland 
wybran had recently returned from poland where he urged 
authorities to publicly oppose racism and antisemitism 
jewish leaders complained the convent and its religious symbols 
were offensive at a site where 25 million jews were killed as part 
of adolf hitlers campaign to exterminate european jews during 
world war ii 
police said they have found no witnesses to the attack 
israels ambassador to belgium avi primor told israeli army 
radio he has been in touch with authorities to discuss the attack 
and security for embassy staff and jews in belgium 
he speculated that among those behind the shooting were 
neonazis 
these of course have a lot of reason to be angry with 
professor wybran primor said he was one of the initiators of 
the campaign to remove the carmelite monastery from auschwitz 
police said wybran was apparently ambushed by a gunman from 
behind wybrans car in the hospital parking lot he had been on his 
way to a ceremony at the universitys martin buber institute a 
jewish studies school 
in december wybran became head of the coordinating committee of 
jewish organizations in belgium which represents about 30000 jews 
from 30 different groups until last year he was head of the 
brussels chapter of bnai brith the jewish charity and social 
organization 
there have been several antisemitic attacks in belgium in 
recent years in july 1980 a grenade exploded as 50 jewish 
teenagers were about to take a bus to summer camp one teenager 
died 
on oct 20 1981 two people died when a van packed with 
explosives blew up outside an antwerp synagogue on sept 18 1982 
four people were injured when gunmen sprayed a brussels synagogue 
with automatic gunfire

the cabinet today endorsed the ban on 
burying ferdinand marcos body in the philippines after the defense 
chief briefed them on an alleged plot to assassinate president 
corazon aquino officials said 
presidential spokesman adolfo azcuna said the sensitive 
information on reputed security threats to the government was 
discussed during the cabinet session but he refused to elaborate 
economic planning secretary jesus estanislao said however that 
defense secretary fidel ramos briefed members on the security risks 
facing the government if mrs aquino allowed the body of the former 
president to be buried in the philippines 
marcos 72 died in honolulu thursday he had lived in exile in 
hawaii since he was toppled in a civilianmilitary uprising that 
propelled mrs aquino to power in february 1986 
mrs aquino has refused to allow the body to be brought back to 
the philippines for burial and also forbade the late presidents 
widow imelda and their three children to come back 
there are destabilization threats estanislao told the 
associated press he ramos presented intelligence reports 
including the possible assassination of the president 
estanislao would not say whether ramos provided details of any 
alleged plot nor whether the defense chief identified those who 
allegedly were behind it 
one thing you must realize is that there are parties abroad 
who are very interested in destabilization including mrs 
marcos he said and there are parties here who are interested 
in destabilization these two parties can act together 
in a news conference after the cabinet meeting ramos refused to 
confirm or deny estanislaos disclosure saying what was taken up 
during the briefing was highly classified 
we are still trying to measure if this is an empty threat or 
not ramos added we cannot afford this kind of hysteria 
because we are trying to attract investments in the country 
marcos followers have been linked to several of the six armed 
attempts to topple mrs aquino but since marcos death 
demonstrations by his followers have been relatively small and 
peaceful 
agriculture secretary carlos dominguez said the cabinet was 
unanimous in its support for the controversial decision despite 
growing public pressure to allow marcos remains to come home 
we have supported the president since the beginning on her 
stand dominguez said there is no question in the cabinet as 
to the position we are taking 
on tuesday the supreme court agreed to consider a petition from 
marcos supporters to overturn the ban and gave the government 10 
days to respond 
mrs aquino says she will abide by the courts decision but 
claims marcos burial in the philippines could lead to civil unrest 
and discourage foreign investment 
mrs marcos has been prohibited from leaving the united states 
where she is to be tried in new york in march on charges of 
embezzling government money and investing some of it in the united 
states the marcoses were indicted in october and mrs marcos is 
free on 5 million bond

a woman who had been acting strangely 
for months fatally stabbed her two young daughters then died after 
ordering her 8yearold son to stab her with the same kitchen 
knife police said 
a state social worker interviewed each family member last month 
after marie kings husband christopher said she threatened to 
poison the children department of health and rehabilitative 
services spokesman ruben betancourt said 
the caseworker found no signs of child abuse and king refused 
further intervention saying he needed his wife at home to take 
care of the children while he worked betancourt said 
the attacks began tuesday afternoon when mrs king 32 became 
enraged at her 3yearold daughter police said 
the mother called the little girl sara into the bedroom 
and stabbed her and then called her other little girl the 
4yearold grace into the bedroom stabbed her and they both 
died on the scene said metrodade police spokesman george reyes 
she then turned the knife over to her son and told him to 
do to her what he had seen the mother do to the two little girls 
reyes said the boy who was shivering in fear when police 
arrived later initially refused his mothers command 
then when he was admonished by his mother and told to do as 
he was told he complied and he stabbed his mother to death in the 
same bedroom that the two little girls were killed in reyes said 
the 8yearold then dialed 911 police and firefighters who 
arrived at the house north of miami found the three bodies 
mrs king had exhibited unusual behavior toward her family for 
several months police said 
a 6yearold son also was in the home during the stabbings but 
the father was not at home police said 
the boys and their father were taken to police headquarters for 
questioning reyes said no charges would be filed against the 
8yearold 
unfortunately he did something that his mother told him to 
do as any boy would do reyes said he responded as his mother 
told him to respond and obviously it just hit him that he had 
done maybe something wrong

an explosion at a student hostel that 
may have been caused by a gas leak killed one person and seriously 
injured five others today the edinburgh fire brigade said 
assistant divisional officer graham stevenson said rescuers were 
still searching for one person who was unaccounted for but faced 
difficult problems because of the high concentration of gas in 
the area 
the inside of the fivestory stone building in central edinburgh 
collapsed in the 730 am explosion but the roof remained 
hanging held on by the two adjoining buildings he said 
four people were taken to the hospital shortly after the 
explosion with serious injuries and the fifth was rescued 3 hours 
later he said the body of the unidentified victim was then 
removed he said 
deputy fire master colin cranston said rescuers were using their 
hands and heatseeking cameras rather than heavy equipment for fear 
the roof and the exterior of the building would collapse on them 
he said the rescue effort was very risky and could take 
several hours 
stevenson said there is a report of other people in the 
building but when asked how many said weve no idea really 
neighboring buildings were evacuated and the area sealed off by 
police passersby were being warned not to light matches or smoke 
cigarettes which could ignite gas still in the air

the philippines consul general here has offered 
to allow ferdinand marcos body to lie in state at the consulate if 
his widow makes the request in writing and philippine president 
corazon aquino consents 
in an ironic twist the body would lie in state in a room 
dedicated to mrs aquinos husband whose 1983 assassination led to 
marcos downfall in a 1986 uprising that lifted mrs aquino to 
power 
consul general tomas buddy gomez made the offer tuesday 
after a shouting match on the consulate steps with marcos 
supporters angry because the philippine flag was not lowered to 
halfstaff after the former phillipine president died in exile here 
at age 72 
gomez said he didnt order the flag lowered because he had no 
instructions from manila to do so 
the request for a lyinginstate at the consulate was made by 
joe lazo president of the friends of marcos he said the marcos 
family would agree to having marcos body in the pavilion named for 
marcos rival benigno aquino jr 
joe you put that in writing and have that signed by the 
widow gomez responded adding he would make a personal request 
to mrs aquino 
gomez also said he would allow marcos to be buried temporarily 
at the consulate if he had philippine and local government approval 
this would satisfy the familys wish not to have marcos buried 
in american soil since the consulate legally is an extension of the 
philippines gomez said 
aquino was gunned down in 1983 at the manila airport as he 
returned to the philippines from selfimposed exile in the united 
states the slaying which many filipinos blamed on marcos and his 
supporters galvanized the opposition 
plans are going ahead to have marcos body temporarily entombed 
here in hopes the philippine government eventually will allow him 
to be buried in his homeland a family spokesman said mrs aquino 
has refused to allow marcos body to be returned to his homeland 
saying it could provoke unrest 
the philippines supreme court has agreed to consider a petition 
from marcos supporters to lift the ban 
marcos body has been on display at the familys mansion in 
makiki heights overlooking honolulu hundreds have visited to view 
the body which will be taken friday to a roman catholic cathedral 
for a funeral mass 
theres one point i want to make perfectly clear and that is 
the final resting place of my father is going to be ilocos norte 
marcos home province said his son ferdinand bong bong marcos 
jr 
entombing marcos above ground would serve a symbolic purpose for 
the family in that the former president would not be buried in us 
soil said gomez

lawmakers from both parties are criticizing 
president bush for not offering us military aid to an attempted 
coup in panama but a senate republican said today the only 
american option is to let things take their course 
once again we have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory 
and i think its an outrage sen jesse helms rnc said 
tuesday 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said us intervention could 
have made a difference in the attempted coup against gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
we have the absolute unilateral right to use force 
deconcini said 
but sen richard lugar rind said of the complaints its 
very easy to be an armchair general 
the president finally has to think about our treaty 
obligations our personnel our relations with other countries in 
the latin american hemisphere and the future of democracy in 
panama which can flow only from the panamanian people making 
choices he said today on the nbc today program 
although the us military forces in panama were on alert 
american officials said they only observed the fighting tuesday 
between members of the panama defense forces standing by to help 
any americans who might be in danger 
lugar a member of the senate foreign relations committee urged 
continued economic and diplomatic pressure on panama saying the 
coup attempt indicated growing discontent inside that country with 
noriega 
i have no doubt that there are going to be further attempts 
there is going to be further pressure this is not over by a long 
shot he said we have only that choice to let things take 
their course 
rep robert torricelli dnj also urged continued economic 
pressure without force 
to simply send in troops is not how democracy should be 
restored in panama torricelli a member of the house foreign 
affairs committee said on abcs good morning america program 
it will happen and will be done the right way without causing a 
backlash against the united states 
senate intelligence committee chairman david boren dokla was 
bitter after emerging from an hourlong classified cia briefing 
tuesday on the coup attempt 
here you have brave people in panama trying to rid 
themselves of a drug dealer and a thug whos taken over their 
country boren said 
and for the united states with all of our strength and force 
and all of our belief in democracy to stand by and do nothing 
and allow these people to fail personally i think is wrong 
boren said he had been notified early tuesday that the coup was 
in progress and followed its progress throughout the day he said 
200 to 300 rebel troops had seized the panamanian defense forces 
headquarters compound with noriega inside and had the leader 
trapped and pinned down 
but later in the day about 500 troops loyal to noriega 
surrounded the compound and freed him the fate of those who led 
the revolt was unclear 
no american troops or citizens were involved boren said 
im just sorry it didnt succeed im sorry there was not some 
way apparently for the united states to help make it succeed 
boren told reporters 
he cited failures by the reagan administration to use force to 
help eric arturo delvalle when he sought to remove noriega from 
power and to help maintain order when noriega later overrode 
national elections to retain power for himself 
asked whether military force should have been used tuesday 
boren said 
my personal view is that we should have and we didnt we 
certainly knew at that moment where noriega was he was in a 
physical location where perhaps he could have been served with that 
warrant for his arrest 
noriega has been indicted in the united states on drug charges 
i think its one thing for the united states to go into any 
other country and try to impose its will from the outside 
boren said 
its quite another thing when the people of panama have very 
clearly spoken in their free elections and overwhelmingly want to 
rid themselves of this corrupt dictatorship i dont think 
it is improper at all for the united states then to offer a helping 
hand to the panamanian people

a japanese housewives organization 
ethiopian scientists and campaigners for tribal peoples today won 
the right livelihood award sometimes called the alternative nobel 
prize 
the seikatsu club consumers cooperative started by a group of 
housewives was awarded the prestigious honorary prize which 
carries no cash award 
four others dr melaku worede of ethiopia the british 
organization survival international and ethiopian doctors aklilu 
lemma and legesse woldeyohannes shared the 120000 cash prize 
the awards will be presented in the swedish parliament on dec 
9 the day before the nobel prize ceremonies 
jacob von uexkull a swedishgerman national sold his valuable 
stamp collection and founded the prize 10 years ago to encourage 
practical solutions to everyday problems 
he said it was largely thanks to the work of survival 
international that we in the west no longer see indians and 
aboriginals as a primitive remnant 
the laureate organization with 5000 members in 60 countries 
was cited for its success in fostering public awareness of the 
importance of traditional peoples knowledge for the future of 
humanity as models of sustainability and survival 
it works to assist tribal peoples worldwide and its aim is to 
secure the rights livelihood and selfdetermination of tribal 
peoples uexkull said one of its successes was that now at least 
the world bank pays lip service to respecting tribal peoples 
right when awarding loans 
lemma and woldeyohannes of ethiopia were cited for their 
scientific work on the use of the entod plant to combat a chronic 
and eventually fatal third world disease bilharzia which afflicts 
more than 200 million people in 74 countries the disease is caused 
by parasites that invade blood vessels 
worede an agronomist and phd graduate from the university of 
nebraska was recognized for his creation of the plant genetic 
resources center in addis ababa ethiopia 
his work has included establishing strategic seeds reserves 
of traditional seeds that can be released to farmers for planting 
in times of drought when other seeds are unlikely to thrive the 
right livelihood socity said 
the seikatsu club consumers cooperative was cited as the most 
successful model of production and consumption in the 
industrialized world aiming to change society by promoting 
selfmanaged and less wasteful lifestyles 
it traces its foundation to 1965 when a single tokyo housewife 
organized 200 women to buy 300 bottles of milk to reduce their 
price 
it now involves 170000 families or about half a million 
people and a business enterprise with a turnover of 287 million 
that will not handle products detrimental to the members health or 
the environment the right livelihood organization said 
the club has also entered japanese politics paving the way for 
women in a traditionally male field on a largely ecological 
antinuclear platform

two gunmen fatally wounded a 
man several yards from a primary school in north belfast today and 
the irish republican army claimed responsibility for the attack 
the ira statement to belfast news media claimed the victim was a 
top member of an unidentified protestant paramilitary group 
the man was walking along a park in the mixed protestantroman 
catholic area when he was shot repeatedly in the head and chest and 
collapsed in the street the royal ulster constabulary said 
he was not immediately identified 
he was lying face down on the pavement which was covered in 
blood i could feel a weak pulse and then it faded away before the 
ambulance arrived said maeve boyle a nurse who rushed to the 
victims aid 
alban mcguinness a belfast city councilman representing the 
social democratic and labor party the provinces main catholic 
party said 
the fact that the shooting appears to have been carried out 
before the horrified gaze of young children going to school speaks 
volumes for the sick mentality of the murderers 
twenty years of violence have claimed 2758 lives in northern 
ireland 47 of them this year 
the chief constable of the royal ulster force meanwhile 
dismissed as nonsense a claim that a secret conspiracy existed 
inside his force to counter government policies that are 
objectionable to the provinces protestant majority 
hugh annesley said in a statement tuesday night that since he 
took office in june all officers of the 13000member force have 
given me their unqualified loyalty and support 
he was reacting to a belfast newspaper report that its deputy 
editor talked with a man identifying himself as spokesman for the 
inner circle an alleged secret society inside the constabulary 
the paper the irish news said the unidentified man displayed 
secret lists of irish republican army suspects which could only 
have come from intelligence agencies 
the paper said the inner circle claimed to be dedicated to 
the removal of ira suspects and the 1985 angloirish agreement 
which went over the heads of protestants to give the irish republic 
a say in the running of northern ireland 
annesley said that despite his skepticism he had asked for the 
claim to be investigated by english detectives who have been called 
in to conduct an independent inquiry into a series of recent leaks 
of intelligence documents 
the almost exclusively catholic ira is fighting to push the 
british out of protestantdominated northern ireland join it with 
the republic of ireland and set up an allireland socialist state

by a 17vote margin residents have 
lifted a major barrier to plans to cut a 250 million highway 
tunnel under the berthoud pass to this ski resort 
the proposed 41mile tunnel would spare motorists from having 
to drive the zigzag road over the breathtaking 11315foot gap and 
would cut 20 minutes off the 90minute 55mile trip from denver to 
winter park 
residents voted 11093 tuesday against a measure that would have 
prevented the city from extending its borrowing powers to the 
tunnel building authority more than a third of the towns 600 
permanent residents are registered to vote 
the berthoud tunnel building authority created by the town 
council will now proceed with a 2 million study of the project 
and its environmental impact the authority can issue bonds to be 
paid off with tolls 
proponents of the tunnel say many tourists are afraid to make 
the drive over the pass supporters also argue it will spur 
development by bringing more skiers to winter park one of the 
nations largest ski resorts 
opponents say that the tunnel would disrupt the quiet lifestyle 
that attracted many people to the area and that the price tag is 
too high

guerrillas claimed today that 
they captured another key town in northwestern cambodia during a 
massive offensive launched as vietnam withdrew the last of its 
troops 
meanwhile cambodian government troops shelled two refugee camps 
run by guerrillas just inside the thai border forcing the 
evacuation of relief workers 
gen dien del acting commander of the khmer peoples national 
liberation front said his troops had captured the town of kandoul 
after two days of attacks and were still advancing on another svay 
chiek 
kandoul is a very big victory we will for sure now take svay 
chiek he said 
the towns were among the objectives the guerrilla group cited 
saturday when they announced a general offensive against the 
prohanoi government in phnom penh 
western sources in this border town speaking on condition of 
anonymity said they believed kandoul 10 miles from the thai 
frontier had been taken 
dien del also claimed his noncommunist guerrilla group along 
with its coalition allies had taken two government positions in 
the ampil district of oddar meanchey province 
western relief staff today were evacuated from site 2 and site 8 
refugee camps on the thaicambodian frontier because of nearby 
shelling said a un official in bangkok he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
site 2 about 30 miles north of aranyaprathet has a population 
of 140000 it is the largest of the string of refugee camps on the 
thai frontier that shelter about 300000 cambodians 
it is controlled by the national liberation front 
site 8 about 60 miles south of site 2 is controlled by the 
radical communist khmer rouge guerrillas 
the relief worker said that as far as he knew no shells had 
fallen into either of the camps 
the national liberation front which claims to field more than 
16000 fighters is loosely allied with the more powerful khmer 
rouge and a group loyal to coalition leader prince norodom sihanouk 
the western sources said no government reinforcements had 
apparently arrived along highway 69 which runs parallel to the 
thai frontier towns along the highway have been the major target 
of the guerrilla offensive which began after the pledged 
withdrawal of all vietnamese forces from cambodia 
vietnam which invaded cambodia in 1978 and had fought the 
guerrillas says it withdrew the last of its troops last week

the south african ambassador has a few 
questions for americans who he admits harbor a certain amount of 
hostility and antagonism toward his country 
thousands of americans are receiving letters from ambassador 
pgj koornhof along with a questionnaire and a reprint of a 
readers digest article arguing against us economic sanctions on 
south africa 
what is your opinion of the south african governments reforms 
to eliminate apartheid is one of the 12 questions 
another one asks in your opinion will punitive us 
sanctions promote positive political change in south africa 
then there is this one a recent editorial concluded that 
sanctions against south africa have increased us dependence on 
the soviet union for strategic minerals does this concern you 
this is routine activity for the press section said delarey 
van tonder the embassys press and information counselor we try 
to keep our mailing list updated 
the questionnaire also asks respondents whether they would like 
more information about south africa divided into four categories 
social labor business and political we try to provide 
objective and balanced information about our country when people 
indicate an interest van tonder said 
south africa and the united states share the ideals of 
democracy and freedom koornhofs letter said noting that both 
are committed to a free market economic system 
we have both confronted the bitter legacy of racism 
segregation and racial segregation in our societies like the 
united states we are working to correct the mistakes and 
injustices of our past the letter said 
several thousand letters have gone out in recent months to 
academics politicians business people and public figures he said 
your opinion is important to me to my government and to south 
africans black and white who are striving to build a truly open 
and democratic society in south africa koornhof wrote 
koornhof noted that while he has not been surprised to find a 
certain amount of hostility and antagonism toward south africa he 
has also found a considerable reservoir of good will 
the hostility is based upon the widely held misperception that 
my government remains committed to preserving apartheid he said 
this is not true as evidenced by the abolition of more than 50 
discriminatory measures since 1980 koornhof said 
the newly elected government of south africa headed by 
president fw de klerk is advocating reform that would grant the 
countrys black majority more freedom but would stop short of 
giving them the right to vote 
herman j cohen assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs told the senate foreign relations committee on tuesday 
that events in south africa are sufficiently encouraging to 
preclude additional us economic sanctions at the present 
time but in a shift from the position of the reagan 
administration cohen did not rule out sanctions if additional 
progress is not made by next june in bringing about powersharing 
talks between blacks and whites 
if after the next parliamentary session next june there is 
very little to show for it cohen said the administration will 
consult with its foreign allies and with congress about what 
sanctions are appropriate 
external and internal pressures are helping convince the south 
african government that it must move beyond its current position 
and accept fundamental change he said 
and in an admission never made by officials of the reagan 
administration cohen added that the sanctions imposed by congress 
in 1986 despite a veto by president reagan have played a role in 
stimulating new thinking within the white power structure

federal officials announced civil suits or 
fines today against 11 cities where local authorities allegedly 
allowed untreated toxic industrial wastes into public sewage 
systems 
the justice department lawsuits on behalf of the environmental 
protection agency were filed against nine cities including 
detroit phoenix and san antonio texas charging violations of 
federal water pollution laws 
in addition san antonio and two other cities agreed to pay 
fines totaling 349000 as part of separate consent agreements 
involving past violations that stemmed from the illegal discharges 
epa officials said 
the cases announced today involved lawsuits filed this week 
four of them today in federal courts in massachusetts michigan 
texas arizona new york and pennsylvania 
the new actions brought to 61 cities in 21 states against which 
either administrative penalties have been sought or civil suits 
were filed this year because of improper releases of toxic 
industrial wastes 
so far the cities have agreed to pay more than 21 million in 
fines the epa is seeking another 19 million in penalties in the 
two dozen cases that remain open a figure that could increase once 
proposed penalties are included from the latest round of lawsuits 
nearly twothirds of the 61 cases were initiated during the past 
two months in some cases the actions were taken by the states 
involved after violations surfaced during epa inspections of 
records officials said 
in the largest case the epa and denver reached a settlement in 
august in which city officials agreed to pay more than 11 million 
in penalties for alleged violations of clean water laws in 
connection with toxic discharges through the municipal sewage 
treatment plant 
these lawsuits and penalties are designed to send a 
message to city and county officials said epa administrator 
william reilly 
attorney general dick thornburgh said the lawsuits reflect the 
bush administrations determination not to sit idly by while our 
waters continue to be befouled 
we simply cannot allow harmful pollutants to reach our rivers 
and streams untreated local officials have a legal and moral 
responsibility to those they represent and to other users of our 
nations waterways to make sure local industries abide by the 
rules thornburgh said 
the federal lawsuits and epa administrative enforcement actions 
allege that the cities failed to adequately identify the industrial 
discharges allowed discharges in some cases without proper 
permits didnt screen samples of the wastewater to determine if 
industrial plants were in compliance and failed to take action 
against polluters violating the pretreatment requirements 
the epa said more than 870 million pounds of toxic industrial 
chemicals including cyanide arsenic and hazardous heavy metals 
such as cadmium and lead were dumped into public sewage treatment 
plants in 1987 the latest year for which figures are available 
these wastes combine with normal sewage and after treatment are 
released into open waters but the treatment for normal sewage 
isnt enough for the toxic wastes so federal law requires that if 
such chemical wastes are to be released through the sewage system 
they must first undergo pretreatment at the industrial plant 
but according to epa estimates as many as onethird of the 
1500 municipal sewage treatment facilities dont adequately 
monitor such pretreatment or take action against violators to 
ensure that the toxic wastes undergo treatment before entering the 
sewage system 
civil lawsuits were filed this week against gloucester mass 
dunkirk ny easton and punxsutawney pa detroit beaumont el 
paso and san antonio texas and phoenix ariz 
the epa said consent agreements for past violations also were 
reached this week with nacogdoches texas 60000 fine 
bellefonte pa 64000 fine and san antonio 225000 fine

lebanese legislators agreed to create 
a parliament with an equal number of moslems and christians but 
remained split today over other aspects of a new government for 
their wartorn land 
conference sources said the political system that had given the 
christians especially maronite catholics most government posts 
continued to be the focus today of the closeddoor talks among 63 
deputies 
the legislators under the auspices of the arab league have 
been discussing since saturday a proposed blueprint for a unified 
government one that would give moslems an equal say 
the old covenant in force since independence from france in 
1943 gave greater power to christians it gave the premiers post 
to the sunni moslems and the parliament speakership to the shiite 
moslems 
maronites then the majority of the population held the 
presidency and dominated the government army parliament and 
judiciary 
moslems now make up 55 percent of the population of 4 million 
under the proposed new system jobs will be filled on merit 
rather than sectarian basis 
the parliamentarians agreed on tuesday to expand the 99member 
parliament to ensure equal distribution of seats between christians 
and moslems 
initially an arab league committee charged with mediating a 
settlement in lebanon had proposed that the number be increased to 
128 
but the conference sources insisting on anonymity said the 
parliamentarians agreed tuesday to add only nine more seats to the 
present chamber giving them all to the moslems to make them equal 
to the christians 
however no agreement was reported in the debate over 
presidential powers which moslems want curtailed to give the 
moslem premiers and house speakers a wider role in the 
decisionmaking process 
the arab league committee is made up of officials from saudi 
arabia morocco and algeria saudi foreign minister prince saud 
alfaisal has attended the sessions often intervening to defuse 
heated arguments 
to abolish political factionalism is easier said than done 
one deputy said requesting anonymity it indeed is an issue too 
explosive for the parliamentarians to handle without prior consent 
of the warlords whose militias control the streets of lebanon 
after government authority has been eroded by 14 years of civil war 
two of these militia chiefs walid jumblatt a druse and nabih 
berri a shiite flew to iran this week where they criticized the 
taif meetings indicating they would not endorse any accord 
the deputies may well agree on a new formula but the test of 
implementation will certainly prove more difficult the maronites 
are not going to go down willingly he said alluding to the 
lebanese forces coalition of rightwing christian militias 
the lebanese forces have not openly vetoed the reforms demanded 
by moslems as the basis for a settlement of the civil war 
but they support the christian army commander gen michel aoun 
who opposes completing any political reforms until syrian agrees to 
a timetable for withdrawing its troops in lebanon 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate but aoun says it has lost its credibility 
because it fought alongside moslems in the civil war 
aoun and the syrians fought bloody artillery duels for six 
months before a ceasefire mediated by an arab league committee on 
lebanon took hold 11 days ago the 14year conflict has killed 
150000 people 
the parliament meetings in taif were not expected to produce a 
final charter but a blueprint to be ratified in a session in 
beirut tentatively scheduled for oct 21

soviet arms experts could visit us laboratories 
doing research on spacebased missile defenses before the end of 
the year an american official said today 
henry cooper chief us negotiator on defense and space at the 
geneva arms talks urged moscow to agree to regular annual 
exchanges of visits to such labs as a confidencebuilding measure 
he said he believed the soviets would accept an invitation to 
tour two us sites made by secretary of state james baker iii 
when baker met with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
last month 
arrangements could be set during the current round of superpower 
arms talks cooper said in an interview with the us missions 
daily bulletin the round is expected to end by early december 
the us invitation covers equipment being developed at the los 
alamos national laboratory in new mexico and a commercial testing 
plant in san juan capistrano calif both are involved in hightech 
research for the us strategic defense invitiative or star wars 
a project launched by former president reagan to provide space 
defenses against incoming ballistic missiles 
moscow has complained about the two facilities in the past and 
visits would show that we are serious about opening our

china sharply criticized hong kong today for 
allowing a top chinese swimmer who defected to fly to the united 
states 
a spokesman for the local xinhua news agency branch which is 
chinas de facto embassy in the colony said hong kong had set a 
bad precedent in its handling of the case and had harmed 
cooperation between the governments 
yang yang 20 the no 2 swimmer in china left hong kong for 
san francisco tuesday after being released from a detention center 
under a discretionary section of the immigration code he was 
arrested sept 23 for having an expired visa 
the swimmer earlier had sought political asylum in hong kong 
saying he feared chinese authorities would jail him for 
participating in prodemocracy marches in this british colony but 
the asylum request was denied 
this has not only marred cooperation between the two sides in 
this respect but will for sure adversely affect the normal contacts 
between the residents of the mainland and hong kong the 
unidentified xinhua spokesman said in remarks issued by the news 
agency 
hundreds of thousands of hong kong residents visit china each 
year with border crossings particularly heavy during the 
traditional chinese holidays 
the agency in paraphrasing the spokesman said the case will 
also cast its shadow over the cooperation between the two sides in 
other fields only the hong kong government should be responsible 
for all the consequences 
a week earlier xinhua issued a statement saying chinese who 
participated in prodemocracy activities in hong kong would not 
face reprisals after returning to china 
the incident comes at a particularly sensitive time for hong 
kong which reverts to chinese sovereignty in 1997 china has 
promised the territory can retain its capitalist system for 50 
years and enjoy a high degree of autonomy 
but confidence in the territorys future suffered a serious 
setback when the chinese army suppressed the prodemocracy movement 
in beijing tension between china and the hong kong and british 
governments tends to exacerbate the problem 
local media reported that yang was granted a nonimmigrant visa 
giving him permission to stay in the united states for six months 
he could later travel to taiwan where he has been offered 
refuge as part of the nationalist governments plan to grant 
residence to chinese who played important roles in the 
prodemocracy movement in china or elsewhere 
the probeijing new evening post today reported that yang said 
after arriving in san francisco that he would not seek political 
asylum in the united states and that he does not know whether he 
will go to another country

president jose eduardo dos santos said 
today that his country will not normalize relations with the united 
states unless washington stops aiding angolan rebels 
speaking to reporters at his futungo de belas residence outside 
luanda dos santos said that despite promising peace initiatives 
war continues in angola and mozambique and it is caused by 
foreign interference 
he indicated angola would make no more concessions in its quest 
for us recognition of luandas marxist government 
angola signed a truce with the national union for the total 
independence of angola on june 22 but peace talks with the 
usbacked guerrilla group broke off after military clashes 
continued 
western diplomats in luanda say dos santos is disappointed by 
us officials who dangled the carrot of recognition to forge 
regional peace accords signed in december by angola cuba and south 
africa and then to get the luanda government to sit at the 
negotiating table with angolan guerrillas 
us officials say diplomatic ties will be withheld until luanda 
agrees to free elections

a state panel set up last year under a 
firstinthenation gun control law aimed at ridding maryland of 
saturday night specials has banned only two weapons and approved 
627 
an additional 34 pistols including several small twoshot 
derringers have been tentatively rejected for sale or manufacture 
in maryland by the handgun roster board 
the approved list includes a semiautomatic uzi pistol from 
israel and the glock 17 from austria that has some plastic parts 
that dont show up on airport xrays 
among other weapons approved are all handguns made by major 
manufacturers such as colt and smith amp wesson as well as handguns 
approved for importation by the us bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms 
the people who were advocates of the law may be disappointed 
that more guns werent excluded from the list said simon atlas 
a member of the board but thats the way the law is written 
certainly the worst fears the national rifle association had have 
been laid to rest 
the nra vigorously opposed the law last year when it was before 
the legislature among those who campaigned for the law were sarah 
brady wife of presidential press secretary james brady who was 
shot and wounded along with president reagan in 1981 
the law makes it illegal beginning in 1990 to sell or 
manufacture handguns in maryland not approved by the ninemember 
board of gubernatorial appointees guns made prior to 1985 are 
excluded from the ban 
under law the panel must consider nine criteria in weighing a 
particular weapon including concealibility accuracy and quality 
to weed out saturday night specials the small cheap lowcaliber 
handguns often used in street crimes 
sanford abrams president of the maryland licensed firearms 
dealers association said the criteria used by the board are 
inexact but he added i think theyre doing a good as job as can 
be expected under the circumstances 
the only two weapons formally banned are 25caliber and 
32caliber guns made by the lw seecamp co of new haven conn 
the company no longer makes the 25caliber model the 32caliber 
gun only 4 inches long was not considered safe enough to meet 
the requirements of the handgun law 
larry w seecamp owner of the company called the boards 
action ridiculous he said the guns cost about 350 are wellmade 
and are favored by women because they are light the company also 
sells to judges he said 
board member matthew fenton who was shot with a handgun several 
years ago said he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the board to 
ban some handguns with assaulttype features such as the uzi 
9mm semiautomatic 
i asked why couldnt we just allow those for law enforcement 
agencies fenton said

seven more killings were 
reported today in natal province where the failure of peace talks 
between black factions has been accompanied by some of the worst 
bloodshed of a 3yearold power struggle 
the feud has claimed at least 15 lives so far this month and 
monitoring groups say more than 95 people were killed last month 
when negotiations between leaders of militant antiapartheid groups 
and the more conservative zulu political organization inkatha 
reached an impasse 
the antiapartheid alliance in a statement today suggested 
that inkatha leader mangotuthu buthelezi has misused the peace 
process to seek political gain the alliance also accused police of 
bias against its followers 
more than 2000 blacks have been killed since factional fighting 
began on a sustained basis in late 1986 
the current peace initiative started in june and the monthly 
death toll dropped by more than half to about 40 as both sides 
issued positive statements but inkatha last month suspended its 
participation in the talks because it felt the other side remained 
hostile 
opposing inkatha are supporters of the united democratic front 
a nationwide antiapartheid coalition and the congress of south 
african trade unions the largest black labor federation both 
groups favor militant antigovernment protest actions and endorse 
the political views of the outlawed african national congress 
guerrilla movement 
inkatha which claims 15 million members rejects the ancs use 
of violence and opposes hardline protest strategies such as 
boycotts general strikes and economic sanctions 
at a news conference leaders of the united democratic front and 
the labor federation suggested buthelezi was more interested in 
enhancing his political position than in achieving peace 
a peace process must be initiated with or without inkatha 
the two organizations said we cannot resolve the violence by 
continually stressing our differences and by attempting to 
politically embarrass each other 
in preliminary talks negotiators proposed a formal peace 
conference involving 10member delegations from inkatha the anc 
the united democratic fron and the trade union congress 
however inkathas leadership declared last month that there 
should only be two 10member delegations its own and one 
representing all the other groups inkatha also said it wants a 
personal reply from the anc in response to a letter buthelezi sent 
regarding arrangements for the talks 
the unrest report issued today by police headquarters said six 
men and a woman were killed overnight in four separate incidents in 
mpumalanga and taylors halt in central natal following standard 
police practice no details were given about the affiliations of 
those involved 
a clash involving roughly 800 men was reported in mpumalanga on 
monday and several houses in the area have been burned down by 
attackers 
also today an opposition political leader challenged the 
pretoria city council to follow the example of johannesburg cape 
town and other cities by ending segregation of public facilities 
tertius spies the regional leader of the antiapartheid 
democratic party said municipal buses libraries parks and 
swimming pools were offlimits to blacks in the nations capital 
despite claims by the governing national party that apartheid was 
dead the national party controls pretorias city council which 
spies said was dragging its heels

families up to 3000 each to settle a housing discrimination suit

applied for apartments in predominantly white housing projects in 
the charlestown south boston and east boston neighborhoods over 
the last decade but were passed over for white applicants

discrimination costs said dianne wilkerson chairwoman of the

for the advancement of colored people 
about 450 other families are eligible for damages of 1000 to 
3000 each

to make grants to encourage integration in the citys public

a lebanese hijacker lured into us custody 
was sentenced today to 30 years in federal prison for comandeering 
a jordanian airliner in 1985 and holding its crew and passengers 
hostage for 30 hours 
us district court judge aubrey robinson sentenced fawaz younis 
to 30 years in prison for taking hostages 20 years for aircraft 
piracy and five years for conspiracy the sentences are to run 
concurrently 
robinson could have imposed a term of life imprisonment but he 
noted that no one on the plane had been killed he said however 
that a lengthy prison term is required because time will never 
wipe out what is in the minds of the passengers and crew 
subjected to the hijacking 
younis who has spent the past two years in custody could be 
eligible for parole in eight years us attorney jay stephens said 
after the sentencing 
stephens said the term is fair and substantial and that 
it sends a clear message to people who would engage in acts 
of international terrorism 
at his sentencing the convicted hijacker asked the judge for 
leniency saying he is not a terrorist and that he treated the two 
americans aboard the airliner as friends 
younis was convicted march 14 of storming the jordanian airliner 
in beirut with four other gunmen and holding the 70 passengers and 
crew hostage for 30 hours all aboard including two americans 
were freed before the plane was blown up 
in 1987 younis was lured aboard a yacht in the mediterranean on 
the pretext of a drug deal and grabbed by undercover fbi agents 
us officials have hailed the case as a strong signal that the 
united states will take whatever steps necessary to deal with 
terrorists 
younis was found innocent of threatening violence against 
passengers destroying a civilian aircraft and carrying explosive 
devices aboard the plane 
why does the american government want to depict me as a 
terrorist and believe that i am a threat to it younis asked in 
a letter to the judge last week 
he said there is a huge difference between me and those 
others involved in terrorism 
younis a member of the amal movement said he was instructed by 
his superiors to hijack an aircraft and fly it to tunis tunisia 
where a meeting of arab league representatives was in progress 
during the hijacking he read a declaration demanding the league 
decide that one arab nation allow all palestinians to settle in the 
country and that palestinians be removed from lebanon 
the thorny problem for this court is that mr younis has 
previously stated and continues to believe that his actions were 
political in nature his lawyer francis carter said in court 
papers 
in a memo to the judge last week the us attorneys office 
said younis was one of the members of amal who held american 
hostages in beirut in connection with the hijacking of twa flight 
847 days after the hijacking of the jordanian airliner 
in the twa hijacking navy diver robert stethem was murdered 
younis admitted he had been among the first to enter the twa 
airliner when it landed at beirut airport said the governments 
sentencing memo 
carter said hezbollah terrorists not the amal movement 
hijacked the twa plane the amal at the request of the us 
government worked to negotiate the release of the hostages taking 
custody of some to prevent all the passengers and crew from falling 
into the hands of hezbollah carter said 
no one from the amal movement was aboard the plane when 
stethem was killed carter said

mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
told a joint meeting of congress today his country intends to 
eradicate drug trafficking at its very roots but he said the war 
against drugs globally is being lost 
salinas who is here on a state visit also stepped up his 
campaign for greater access for mexican products to us markets 
descibing as an inequitable paradox the relative openness of 
mexico to foreign imports compared with the united states 
while pledging a continued allout effort to curb drug 
smuggling salinas ruled out joint usmexican military operations 
to fight the traffickers 
mexico intends to eradicate drug trafficking at its very roots 
in the sphere that falls under its responsibility salinas said 
speaking in spanish while his listerners read from copies 
translated into english 
this world fight is also our own he said he added that 
mutual finger pointing about who is to blame for continued drug use 
wastes time and effort that should be spent attacking the common 
enemy 
salinas received a warm welcome from the assembled gathering 
when he entered the house chamber a reflection of the marked 
improvement in usmexican relations since he assumed the 
presidency 10 months ago 
but consistent with most addresses by foreign leaders before 
joint meetings of congress only a small percentage of the 535 
voting members actually were present most of the seats were filled 
by congressional pages 
salinas who met on tuesday with president bush said there is a 
mature and responsible understanding of the links in the drug 
chain of terror he added that there is greater acceptance in the 
united states regarding the importance of giving greater emphasis 
to reducing demand for drugs 
previously the united states put much of its focus on reducing 
the supply through interdiction and other efforts 
while stressing mexicos willingness to cooperate salinas said 
the struggle worldwide against drug use has suffered setbacks 
when we see the magnitude of the fight against drugs we must 
honestly ask ourselves are we winning or losing the war i think 
that at the world level we are losing and that is unacceptable 
he said the solution lies in more cooperation among governments 
on trade salinas said mexico needs greater reciprocity to 
ensure that it will continue to be one of the most open economies 
in the world 
our country is practically free of trade barriers but we 
continue confronting them in the united states salinas said 
let us resolve this inequitable paradox we seek greater access 
to the textile and steel markets and the generalized system of 
preferences we want a bilateral agreement that will break down 
trade barriers sector by sector 
us officials have expressed irritation with salinas portrayal 
of the united states as a protectionist nation they point out that 
twothirds of mexicos exports come to the united states and that 
mexico had a 27 billion surplus in its us trade last year on 
total twoway trade of about 44 billion

wilbur trammells bid to become buffalos 
first black mayor has been set back by a court ruling invalidating 
his independent party petitions 
the former judge said he would appeal the decision reached 
tuesday night 
the ruling could keep trammell off the november ballot and allow 
james d griffin to run with no ballot opposition for an 
unprecedented fourth fouryear term 
in its unanimous decision the appellate division of state 
supreme court upheld a lower court ruling that petitions to place 
trammell on the ballot as an independent were invalid because he 
failed to have a document notarized 
trammell said if his appeal fails he will run as a writein 
candidate

a skeptical supreme court was urged today to 
overturn a dallas ordinance that imposes strict licensing 
requirements for sexually oriented businesses 
john h weston a beverly hills calif lawyer representing the 
businesses said the texas citys ordinance imposes a prior 
restraint on free speech that violates the constitution 
under the ordinance one may not disseminate speech one has 
chosen to disseminate absent a permit weston said the local law 
permits the city to do indirectly what it can not do directly 
he said 
were not dealing with nuclear power plants weston added in 
arguing there is no lawful ground for such strict rules 
but the justices repeatedly challenged westons assertions 
chief justice william h rehnquist addressing one of the 
lawyers main arguments said there is no precedent for giving 
special consideration to bookstores seeking licenses to do business 
there is no supreme court case close to suggesting that 
rehnquist said 
justice antonin scalia in frequently barbed questioning said 
to weston you mean that every bookstore cannot be subject to 
normal business licensing 
dallas city attorney analeslie muncy said the ordinance is a 
vital weapon against crime and urban decay 
the licensing rules are aimed at businesses that are 100 
percent sexually oriented she said 
she added that nothing prevents the business owners from 
distributing their wares in other ways 
they can sell the same material through the mails door to 
door or on a street corner she said 
the justices are expected to announce a ruling by july 
providing new guidelines on how far communities may go to limit 
sexually oriented businesses 
the dallas ordinance is being challenged by owners of adult 
bookstores motion picture theaters nightclubs and motels 
the law also applies to nudemodel studios and sexualencounter 
establishments but no such businesses were represented in todays 
case 
the 1986 ordinance requires sexually oriented businesses to 
obtain a license issued by the city police chief 
such businesses must permit inspection of their premises during 
operating hours no one convicted of a variety crimes including 
promoting prostitution may obtain a license 
the ordinance also bars motel owners from renting rooms for less 
than 10 hours a provision intended to discourage prostitution 
establishments offering sexually oriented entertainment must be 
open to surveillance by authorities without search warrants 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the local law the 
appeals court said the citys campaign against urban blight crime 
and declining property values provides compelling justification 
for the regulations 
the city need only show that a criminal conviction and the 
evil to be regulated bear a substantial relationship to justify 
that aspect of the ordinance the appeals court said 
it also said that the discretion given the police chief to 
issue suspend and revoke licenses is not impermissibly broad 
the supreme court in 1986 upheld a renton wash ordinance 
restricting the location of adult theaters 
the dallas ordinance also contains strict zoning rules but the 
justices rejected a challenge to those provisions in the dallas 
law leaving them intact 
several groups have joined the dallas business owners in 
attacking the ordinance they include the american booksellers 
association the association of american publishers the national 
association of college stores and the freedom to read foundation 
citizens for decency through law and the american family 
association lined up to support the dallas ordinance

the supreme court has upheld president 
virgilio barcos decree allowing extradition of accused drug bosses 
to the united states but overturned his order to seize their 
ranches mansions and other property 
the government meanwhile was preparing to send another alleged 
drug trafficker to the united states 
the court met tuesday to rule on constitutional aspects of 
decrees barco issued as part of a 7weekold crackdown on 
colombias drug cartels 
the decisions by the 24member supreme court preserve barcos 
main weapon in his governments unprecedented crackdown on cocaine 
traffickers who have used murder bribery and intimidation to 
thwart colombian efforts to bring them to justice 
but the court ruled that a barco decree allowing property 
seizures did not specifically cite drug traffickers and threw it 
out on a technicality 
however barco today made a statement saying he issued another 
decree a year ago that specifically did cite drug traffickers the 
court now must rule on that decree 
meanwhile military raids are expected to continued the 
government already has seized 1056 homes ranches mansions and 
other properties belonging to drug barons 
us officials say that because colombian cocaine bosses are 
unable to intimidate us judges the traffickers fear extradition 
more than any other measure against them since 1981 about 50 
colombian judges have been killed in attacks blamed on the drug 
gangs 
traffickers of the medellin cocaine cartel said last month in a 
letter to barco that they prefer a grave in colombia to a us jail 
on sept 6 colombia extradited eduardo martinez an economist 
thought to work for the medellin cartel martinez was sent to 
atlanta to face federal charges of laundering millions of cartel 
drug dollars 
us and colombian authorities have begun extradition procedures 
against another drug suspect ana rodriguez de tamayo indicted in 
1983 in miami on conspiracy and drug trafficking charges 
authorities last week notified ana rodriguez de tamayo that her 
extradition was pending and her fiveday appeal period expires 
thursday 
rodriguez de tamayo was indicted in miami in 1983 on conspiracy 
and drug trafficking charges the national radio chain caracol said 
today that the government had taken final legal steps toward her 
extradition making that possible at any time now 
the united states also wants extraditon of two other purported 
traffickers bernardo pelaez roldan and guillermo bueno delgado 
recently captured by colombian authorities 
tuesdays court ruling on the extraditions backs the barco 
administration at a time when the conflict shows no signs of 
abating 
since barco declared the crackdown hours after the assassination 
of a leading presidential candidate aug 18 authorities have 
blamed drug traffickers for at least 142 bombings 
by ruling extradition constitutional the court helped allay 
fears that the justice system would undermine barcos campaign 
the court has a history of resisting barcos efforts to use 
state of siege powers to fight leftist guerrillas and drug 
traffickers in 1984 the high court ruling on a technicality 
declared extraditions to the united states unconstitutional 
in apparently unrelated violence a defense ministry source said 
leftist guerrillas kidnapped and killed a catholic bishop in the 
northeastern state of arauca 
the source said the national liberation army had kidnapped 
bishop jesus emilio jaramillo on monday and that the church 
officials body was found tuesday near the town of arauquita on the 
border with venezuela 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said there was 
no indication why the bishop may have been murdered 
the national liberation army is headed by a defrocked priest 
manuel perez the defense ministry source said the bishop was 
killed by another defrocked priest serving under perez

riot police fired tear gas today to 
disperse university students protesting the arrest of two student 
leaders 
an estimated 4000 students boycotted classes and many fought 
running battles with batonwielding riot squads a student 
spokesman said 
stones were thrown at police and the windows of a limousine 
used by the zimbabwe university vice chancellor professor walter 
kamba were smashed by rioters said the spokesman who requested 
anonymity 
sporadic clashes continued throughout the day and the 
semiofficial zimbabwe inter african news agency said more than 50 
protesters were arrested 
it was not clear whether students were injured 
deputy police commissioner douglas chingoka was quoted as saying 
that the unrest was very well under control 
the news agency said university officials were scheduled to meet 
with president robert mugabe to discuss the student protests 
in a leaflet distributed before the start of classes today 
student leaders called for a meeting on campus to discuss the 
arrests today of student council members arthur mutambara and enock 
chikweche 
the leaflet said police surrounded and stormed a campus 
residence and mutambara was profusely bleeding after jumping 
from a secondfloor window in an effort to escape from police who 
broke down the door of his bedroom 
the notorious riot police have struck said the leaflet it 
described student action in response as a matter of life and 
death 
student leaders said they believed mutambaras arrest was 
prompted by a statement he issued oct 2 criticizing the government 
and university authorities 
that statement said police banned a student meeting scheduled 
for sept 29 to mark the first anniversary of a student 
demonstration organized in 1988 to protest official corruption 
in the past year college students have staged several 
demonstrations in which they accused the government of stifling 
free expression and curbing academic freedoms 
education minister fay chung labeled students hooligans and 
drunkards and said they were being manipulated by political 
opponents to attack the government

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
today the united states reserves the right to use military force 
against panamanian leader gen manuel antonio noriega and 
dismissed armchair generals who faulted the administration for 
failing to support tuesdays failed coup with american troops 
the united states retains the option to use american forces 
that option has never been ruled out baker told the senate 
finance committee but if youre going to risk american lives 
its the presidents view that you do so on your own timetable 
you do so based on your own plans at a time of maximum 
opportunity and advantage you dont do so on the basis of someone 
elses plans and in response to rapidly changing circumstances 
he said 
at the pentagon one official said various military options were 
discussed tuesday with president bush as the coup unfolded another 
official said when it appeared as though noriega might have been 
dethroned there were several options considered none of which 
was going in and getting him both spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
baker deftly sidestepped whether the administration played any 
role in the failed coup attempt but he implied that the united 
states had kept its distance because the rebels had little chance 
of ousting noriega 
a number of members of congress including sen david boren 
dokla chairman of the senate intelligence committee criticized 
the bush administration after the shortlived coup for what they 
said was failure to support members of the special security unit 
that tried to take over noriegas central command post 
its easy to be an armchair general baker said without 
informing the committee members whether the rebels had at least 
tacit assurances of us support as some reports have suggested 
baker said president bush acted immediately to do two things 
to safeguard american lives and to assure the security of the 
panama canal just as the united states is obligated to do under 
the panama canal treaties 
the treaties call on the united states to turn control of the 
americanbuilt canal at the end of the century and to maintain the 
neutrality of the waterway 
us troops at the southern command in panama said the situation 
today is calm but troops and civilians remained under a delta 
advisory which means they are to avoid unnecessary travel outside 
uscontrolled areas the pentagon said 
officials acknowledged tuesday they had advance word of a coup 
attempt but the president said the united states did not engineer 
it 
we had some indications this sort of thing was in the works 
said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater but until it 
happens you never know he characterized the prior information 
as rumblings 
but baker provided no details of the precise steps taken by the 
white house while events unfolded on tuesday in panama he said 
they were breaking rapidly 
it is easy after the fact in one of these situations to 
secondguess the events by arguing that the united states should 
have done something differently baker said 
he told the committee the administration considered noriegas 
government an outlaw regime and would continue pressuring for 
him to give up power 
our policy has been to apply relentless pressure on the 
noriega regime across the board diplomatically economically and 
to defend american lives and united states rights under our panama 
canal treaties he said 
some members of congress said bush could have provided military 
support to the rebel forces which tried to depose noriega the 
general is sought in the united states on drug trafficking charges 
once again we have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory 
and i think its an outrage said sen jesse helms ranking 
republican on the senate foreign relations committee boren said 
tuesday it was wrong for the united states with its 12000 
military personnel in panama to stand by and do nothing and 
allow these people to fail 
but vice president dan quayle had said were not going to be 
involved in any kind of a coup attempt in latin america and this 
morning sen richard lugar of indiana a moderate republican 
dismissed the criticism its very easy to be an armchair 
general he told nbc 
the washington times today quoted congressional sources as 
saying that in advance of tuesdays attempt american military 
officers in panama led the rebels to believe they would get us 
military help 
an unidentified senior administration official told the 
washington post that rebel leaders had passed word at least three 
times this week that an effort to topple noriega was imminent one 
official told the new york times that the united states had agreed 
to tae custody of noriega if the rebels captured him another 
official told the times that before it became clear noriega had not 
been captured the united states had asked to have him turned over 
and the rebels refused 
i want to see democracy in panama succeed bush insisted 
after it became apparent tuesday that noriega had squashed the coup 
am i disappointed that noriega is still there yes i am he 
said later 
nothings changed everything remains the same well continue 
to press for noriegas removal and his arrest to stand trial in 
the united states said fitzwater 
bush turned aside further questions tuesday night at a state 
dinner for visiting mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
but quayle said im not sure what we could have done to 
help the antinoriega forces this is a situation that is going 
to be handled within panama were not going to be involved in any 
kind of a coup attempt in latin america this is panamas 
problem 
earlier tuesday bush gave verbal support to the stillbattling 
coup leaders in comments to reporters he said the administration 
has no argument with noriegas panamanian defense forces only 
with the dictator himself bush has made similar comments over the 
past several months in what some saw as barely disguised goading 
for the pdf to mount a coup 
saying he hoped his words would be conveyed instantly to 
panama the president said our argument has been with mr 
noriega who aborted the democratic will of the people of panama 
a reference to noriegas invalidation of last mays election that 
observers said was overwhelmingly won by his opposition 
there were rumors around that this was some american operation 
and i can tell you that is not true bush told reporters at an 
oval office photo session 
we did not take any action that would have constituted direct 
involvement said fitzwater adding that us helicopters 
observed the fighting and troops were stationed around one of the 
causeways there to protect access and rights and so forth

premier ante markovic called for a 
multiparty system as a solution for the countrys growing economic 
and political problems and charged that conservative communists are 
blocking his reforms 
the logic of pluralistic ownership which demands a system of 
its own will have to demand and open the society to a multiparty 
system he said in a television interview tuesday night 
markovics statement challenged a communist party ruling that 
allows existence of multiple parties only under the the socialist 
alliance a communistdominated umbrella group 
despite growing calls for change the communist party has so far 
blocked the multiparty systems gradually being embraced by warsaw 
pact allies hungary and poland 
markovic however said that the new socialism he has sought 
to introduce as part of his marketoriented economic reforms is 
meeting with growing resistance of the communists 
he said that opponents to his economic reforms expressed concern 
that state property would become threatened by the planned 
economic liberalization 
i expect now an intensification of the conflict between 
ideology and reforms markovic said 
yugoslavias annual inflation rate hit an alltime record of 
nearly 1200 percent mostly due to sharp increases in the prices 
of vital staples and services such as electricity meat and bread 
officials in the countrys largest republic serbia have said 
they will demand markovics resignation if his program does not 
quickly curb the rampant inflation 
in a speech when he became premier in march markovic called an 
openmarket economy an ultimate achievement of mankind for which 
no alternative has yet been found 
he demanded urgent introduction of stocks and bonds private 
initiative and entrepreneurship in the yugoslav economy and an end 
to state interference in the running of businesses 
other segments of the radical marketoriented economic reforms 
underlined by markovic would include the reshaping of the banking 
system along western lines creation of a capital market and an 
end to state subsidies for lossmaking enterprises 
in addition to europes highest inflation rate yugoslavia is 
burdened by a 19 billion foreign debt a 17 percent unemployment 
rate and growing labor and ethnic unrest 
yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces each with its own government and party structure serbia 
is dominated by hardline communists 
the decentralized system of government and collective federal 
presidency were devised in 1974 constitution to prevent one 
republic from gaining sway over the others but it has resulted in 
an ineffective government by compromise 
in yugoslavia the federal government is generally responsible 
for economic policy while the collective presidency which appoints 
the premier dictates defense and foreign policy 
but the bulk of political influence in the country is 
concentrated in the communist party with power dispersed in eight 
often fractious central committees reflecting the administrative 
division of the country

an evenly divided senate finance committee 
refused early today to reduce the tax on capital gains voting 
instead to liberalize individual retirement accounts in an effort 
to encourage saving 
the 1010 vote was split nearly along party lines but both 
sides agreed the battle will be fought again on the senate floor 
perhaps later this week 
the vote came on an amendment by sen bob packwood rore to 
substitute a capital gains cut for the expanded iras that chairman 
lloyd bentsen dtexas had written into the bill the bush 
administration supports packwoods plan 
the tie vote retained bentsens plan to liberalize iras 
each side argued that the others plan was more beneficial to 
those with higher incomes but there was little of the emotional 
debate that marked house passage of a different capital gains cut 
and rejection of the same ira proposal a week earlier 
president bush today prodded the senate to follow the houses 
example and sharply reduce the capital gains tax the house version 
would cut the tax on capital gains now 28 to 33 percent to 196 
percent for two years then index it to inflation 
bush addressing a group of minority small business people 
said this is a tax cut for all a way to channel investment back 
into new growth and new jobs it is a joboriented tax cut 
the vote against the capital gains cut came as the committee 
completed work on a bill whose chief purpose is to reduce the 1990 
federal budget deficit by about 8 billion the bill was approved 
on a voice vote early today 
most of the deficit reduction would come from a package of 
relatively minor revenue increases including permanent extension 
of the 3 percent tax on local and long distance telephone service 
the biggest single moneyraiser in the bill is a 36 billion 
reduction in government medicare reimbursements for doctors and 
hospitals 
the remainder would come from a potpourri of relatively minor 
tax changes mostly affecting corporations 
numerous provisions that have no relation to deficit reduction 
were tacked onto the bill one of the biggest was a 
1billionayear saving for social security recipients between the 
ages of 65 and 69 who continue to work past the traditional 
retirement age 
with all nine republicans and democrat david boren of oklahoma 
in opposition the committee voted to allow all workers to take a 
tax deduction for half an ira contribution of up to 2000 a year 
most of the tax saving on that change would go to workers making 
more than 50000 a year since those below that income level 
already are permitted fully or partially deductible accounts 
workers at all income levels would be allowed to take 
penaltyfree withdrawals from their iras to make the down payment 
on a first home or to pay for a college education 
under packwoods amendment the longer a share of stock land or 
other investment was owned the less its profits would be taxed 
when sold for example 95 percent of the profit would be taxed if 
sold after one year after six years 70 percent would be taxed 
the legislation includes several miscellaneous tax cut 
provisions in addition to expanded iras that have nothing to do 
with reducing the budget deficit 
those include new assistance for rural hospitals and extension 
of several expiring tax breaks including those for employerpaid 
education assistance firsttime homebuyers and corporations that 
increase spending for research 
it would increase to 14500 a year the amount that people 
between the ages of 65 and 69 may earn without losing any of their 
social security benefits the earnings limitation this year is 
8880 for each 3 earned above that level the beneficiary loses 
1 of social security 
the bill would repeal a scheduled decline in the 8 percent 
airline passenger ticket tax the completedcontract method of 
accounting that permits big builders and defense contractors to 
defer taxes and a lucrative tax benefit for some corporations that 
borrow to fund an employee stockownership plan

argus leader sioux falls sd on chemical weapons 
if hypocrisy was an international crime the united states would 
be guilty 
on one hand the nation is building a stockpile of chemical 
weapons 
on the other it condemns countries such as libya and iraq for 
producing chemical arms 
intellectual conflicts like that aside the worlds superpowers 
and other nations finally seem positioned to make major progress 
toward a ban on chemical weapons 
encouragingly president bushs condemnation of such weapons 
last week before the united nations general assembly was well 
received 
bush offered to cut us stocks of chemical weapons by more than 
80 percent if the soviet union would do the same 
the soviet union in turn said it would radically reduce or 
completely destory its chemical weapons halt nuclear tests and 
stop making weaponsgrade plutonium and uranium if the united 
states would do the same 
bushs proposal would require that the soviet union make deeper 
cuts than the united states because the soviets have more chemical 
weapons that might be a stumbling block toward further progress 
so will the very breadth of the soviet proposal which also would 
affect nuclear weapons 
but some of the biggest obstacles had to be overcome just to get 
this far continued progress is welcome whether it is wrapped in 
hypocrisy or not

seattle postintelligencer on colombia 
the cocainebeseiged president of colombia virgilio barco made 
some eminently reasonable requests of the united states on his 
visit to washington last week 
barco who is trying to get tough with the drug lords who all 
but run his country did not come seeking more financial aid 
instead he asked for help of a different sort than merely throwing 
money at the problem 
barco rightly enough wants the us to restore a coffeeexport 
quota system that favors colombia when the us blocked renewal of 
the quota agreement last july world coffee prices plummeted the 
effect of this in colombia is to turn more coffee farmers into 
cocaine farmers a development that is not in this nations 
selfinterest 
barco also asked president bush to curtail the export from the 
us to colombia of chemicals used to manufacture cocaine and to 
limit production of the automatic weapons used by the drug lords 
and barco asked members of congress for greater efforts to 
educate americans against the use of drugs to help shut off the 
market 
in taking on the drug lords barco is risking his life the 
least this government can do is support policies that make barcos 
unenviable task less daunting

the providence ri sunday journal on the capital gains tax 
in retrospect it is hardly surprising that president bushs 
capital gains tax cut should win so handily in the house of 
representatives last week 
politicians can scarcely resist voting for a plan to get 
something for nothing and despite all the rhetoric to the 
contrary that is just what this tax cut offered 
the rich that majority leader richard gephardt insists 
will be the only beneficiaries of a capital gains tax cut include 
low and middleincome earners who would benefit only after cashing 
in their investments 
many of these same people voted for george bush last november 
and the unexpectedly lopsided vote on capital gains may indicate 
that their interests are being recognized by a growing number of 
legislators 
this trend if it spreads to related tax and budget issues 
could provide the president with a working majority in congress 
similar to the one forged by ronald reagan in 1981 
we believe the economic policies that would emerge from capitol 
hill under those circumstances would be good for the country

hobbs nm daily newssun on mail and telephone frauds 
careless about who spends your money 
you are if you give out your credit card numbers to strangers 
who solicit your business over the telephone and you are if you 
send out checks to official looking contest companies who 
inform you that you can collect a fat prize if you will only send 
them money to pay for processing your award 
these scams and hundreds more just like them are literally 
flooding the us mails today going out to countless millions of 
unsuspecting americans and there is little difficulty in these 
ripoff artists reaching almost everyone with a post office address 
its a crying shame that billions of dollars are being bilked 
out of millions of americans by reason of an allout assault on 
them through the mails and via telephones and two things make it 
possible federal regulations are not sufficiently strict to 
prevent massive mail and telephone fraud and too many people the 
victims still believe there is a free lunch 
we urge congress to devise effective antifraud laws for the 
nations communications systems to prevent the robbery of innocent 
people

the record hackensack nj on the lack of azt for children 
hundreds of kids are suffering and dying because they are unable 
to obtain azidothymidine the most effective treatment against aids 
burroughs wellcome co the manufacturer says its moving as 
fast as it can to make azt available to kids but the assurance 
rings hollow since the company has yet to apply for government 
approval to market the drug to children under 12 
critics say the company is dragging its feet because the 
potential market among children is small 
until the drug receives fda approval for the children the 
insurance companies and the federal government will not pick up its 
cost about 6000 a year which many parents cannot afford 
in addition the adult formulation of azt is too strong for 
children the capsules must be broken and smaller amounts of the 
foultasting medicine mixed with juice or another liquid 
the situation is absurd the company should file an application 
as soon as possible and develop a dosage that is appropriate for 
childern aids doesnt discriminate against children neither 
should burroughs

the jackson mich citizen patriot on plans to redesign coins 
tinkering with the us monetary system is an itch that congress 
cant seem to scratch enough so would someone do our fearless 
leaders a favor and send a gallon or two of antiitch oil 
in recent months a majority of senators and representatives in 
congress have supported legislation to change the basic designs of 
all of our coins as one advocate put it congress believes that 
americans want new coins that arent so fixed in the past 
congress would have us remove the old baldie the american 
eagle it would be farewell to tjs fabulous digs at monticello and 
abe lincolns multicolumned memorial 
replacing them would be more contemporary designs on themes of 
the us constitution and bill of rights the heads of jfk fdr and 
other presidents would still adorn the heads sides of coins 
but the likenesses would be updated 
weve got no objection to modernizing things that need to be 
modernized but wheres the hue and cry arising for modernized 
coins from coin collectors who dont have enough diversity 
its hard to understand why congress so laden down with real 
money problems must go out of its way to correct perceived money 
problems as harmless as it seems redesigning coins does strange 
things to the americans psyche 
if you dont buy that then 300 million stockpiled susan b 
anthony silver dollars argue otherwise

after leaving hundreds of customers stranded after moving 
hundreds of employees to kansas city mo after laying off 2700 
employees the airline says it expects to fly again despite its 
filing for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 
braniff fell victim to its own stupidity 
the final proof came sept 27 when airline officials simply 
canceled all but four flights without explanation pending a 
confirmation announcement that came the next day 
it is difficult to imagine after such a repeat performance why 
anyone would trust braniff for a future flight

the cabinet on wednesday backed the 
ban on burying ferdinand marcos in the philippines after the 
defense chief reportedly warned legislators of threats against the 
government 
also wednesday a government agency said it might help the 
former presidents widow imelda with her legal problems if she 
returns some assets acquired with money allegedly embezzled by 
marcos during his rule 
marcos 72 died in honolulu on thursday he had lived in exile 
in hawaii since he was ousted in a militarycivilian uprising that 
catapulted corazon aquino to power in february 1986 
mrs aquino has refused to allow the body to be brought back 
here for burial citing possible civil unrest 
economic planning secretary jesus estanislao said defense 
secretary fidel ramos told cabinet members the country faced a 
number of security risks if marcos body were returned 
there are destabilization threats estanislao told the 
associated press he ramos presented intelligence reports 
including the possible assassination of the president 
ramos refused to confirm or deny estanislaos disclosure saying 
the briefing was highly classified 
ramos said his department has been constantly receiving reports 
about possible attempts against the government he said the 
20yearold communist insurgency remains the most serious threat 
marcos followers have been linked to several of the six armed 
attempts to topple mrs aquino but since marcos death 
demonstrations by his followers have been relatively small and 
peaceful 
on tuesday the supreme court agreed to consider a petition from 
marcos supporters to allow marcos to be buried in his homeland and 
to allow his widow and three children to attend they also are 
barred from entering the philippines 
in a speech wednesday mrs aquino repeated her concerns about 
allowing the marcos family in 
i know the threat that this man poses to the country i am 
sworn to protect yet i know the loneliness of exile and the pain 
of being struck by death without setting foot on ones native 
soil mrs aquino said 
imelda marcos has been banned from leaving the united states 
pending her trial in new york in march on charges of embezzling 
philippine government money and investing some of it in the united 
states the marcoses were indicted last october and mrs marcos is 
free on 5 million bail 
augusto villarin a deputy chief of the presidential commission 
on good government said if mrs marcos surrendered a substantial 
portion of the hidden wealth the government might intercede 
with us authorities to drop the charges 
my common sense tells me that if the victim which is the 
philippine government has been satisfied that the stolen wealth 
has been returned maybe we can request the us government to be 
lenient villarin said 
the commission was appointed to recover the estimated 10 
billion the marcoses allegedly stole during his 20year rule 
marcos denied the charges

about 130 east germans some telling 
desperate stories about swimming rivers and evading border police 
arrived at the west german embassy wednesday seeking refuge and 
passage to the west 
the newcomers brought to about 400 the number of people waiting 
in poland for word on their bid to reach west germany 
a west german diplomat urged the refugees to be calm and not to 
fear giving accurate information as they were registered even 
though some had crossed the border illegally 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said in a 
radio interview that he expected poland to keep its word not to 
send any refugees back to the gdr east germany against their 
will 
an interior ministry spokesman said there were mass scale 
attempts by east germans to enter poland illegally and that border 
guards had turned back some east germans before they reached poland 
there have been no confirmed reports of east germans being 
handed back over to east germany once they are on polish soil 
many east germans said they headed for poland after learning the 
border to czechoslovakia had been closed however east germans 
need permits from their government to travel to poland and several 
said these were now unavailable 
genscher said he expected a solution would be found for the 
refugees in poland although none was announced when permission was 
given tuesday night for about 11000 east germans to leave prague 
when the two germanys reached their first agreement about 
refugees about 800 left poland for west germany by train early 
sunday following thousands of others from prague 
among those waiting for a second solution to the crisis are some 
who missed the weekend release by minutes 
one father said that as his family drove up sunday to learn they 
were too late we panicked we didnt know what would be 
but we were sure we wouldnt go back he said and then it 
turned out we were not alone 
wednesdays arrivals huddled outside a kiosk near the west 
german embassy in a residential section of warsaw filling out 
forms and waiting for buses to transport them to hotels 24 miles 
from the capital 
some trembled in clothing wet from their overnight swim across 
the neisse and oder rivers that form the border an embassy 
official brought a carload of blankets 
reports circulated of soldiers massing at the border and some 
refugees told of hiding from guards 
some said polish border guards had chased refugees earlier 
groups of east germans had said polish authorities appeared to make 
little effort to stop the crossings 
col andrzej sadlinski the spokesman for the interior ministry 
confirmed that many east germans had tried to cross the border 
illegally he said poland was obligated to prevent such crossings

statesmanjournal salem ore on dr elizabeth morgan 
it doesnt take a sharp legal mind to figure out that something 
went wrong with our justice system when a mother who wouldnt tell 
the court where her daughter is must spend more time in jail than 
drug dealers and rapists 
dr elizabeth morgan arguing that her exhusband sexually 
abused her 7year old daughter refused to produce hilary for 
courtordered visits morgan spent 759 days in jail for contempt 
of court 
it took a public outcry and an act of congress to free her but 
the case isnt finished and she could be jailed again for 
continuing to defy the court 
the law that tries to force a person to obey legitimate legal 
orders especially when it involves a youngster is sound its the 
procedure and the judges interpretation that are out of whack 
custodial interference cases of this sort demand a different 
kind of justice and punishment and now that congress has seen the 
injustice of sentencing morgan to an indeterminate sentence 
without a trial or a conviction maybe it will change the laws on 
contempt of court

santa barbara calif newspress on education vs apathy 
when president bush invited the nations governors and educators 
to charlottesville va last week to establish broad educational 
goals they were there along with 900 newspaper and television 
reporters it was a happening 
two weeks ago when the santa barbara council on alcoholism and 
drug abuse invited 7500 parents to attend a presentation intended 
to help them keep their children in school and out of the clutches 
of chemical dependency organizers were justifiably stunned and 
bewildered when only 30 people attended for them it was a poignant 
moment a stark realization that this essential ingredient in the 
formula for educational success is often missing 
in convening the nations governors for only the third time in 
us history president bush who has vowed to be the education 
president implored parents to become full partners in the 
education of their children 
for the united states to regain its standing in a rapidly 
changing world as the best and brightest it will not be a measure 
of george bush or the 50 governors it will be a measure of 
individual commitment to do better 
if johnny cant read or write or add and subtract the solution 
ultimately lies in the living room and the classroom with each and 
every parent student and teacher interested engaged and 
determined

lawrence kan journalworld on a national education curriculum 
gov mike hayden of kansas is on the right track with his 
opposition to a national education curriculum some of the current 
problems in the us education system probably can be attributed to 
an increasing lack of local control over schools 
when teachers and administrators get too tied up with fulfilling 
state mandates or measuring up to federal standards they find it 
harder and harder to provide the kind of education that may be 
needed in their individual communities 
to say that schools in innercity chicago should teach the same 
classes that are taught in rural baldwin kan is to ignore the 
socioeconomic and cultural differences that exist between those 
two areas

zaires president mobutu sese seko and 
president bush met today in efforts to bolster the faltering truce 
accord between angolas government and its usarmed opposition 
mobutu in new york to attend the united nations general 
assembly made a quick trip to washington for the meeting as part 
of intensive behindthescenes us efforts to prevent the collapse 
of the agreement reached through zairean mediation in june 
the two leaders met for nearly 45 minutes mobutu declined to 
answer reporters questions as he left the white house 
also in washington today were jonas savimbi the rebel who leads 
the union for the total independence of angola unita and pedro 
van dunem the foreign minister of angolas sovietbacked 
government 
us officials have ruled out a meeting among all three sides 
but not a possible reconciliation meeting between savimbi and 
mobutu savimbi is scheduled to meet bush on thursday 
mobutu who has served as the major conduit of an estimated 40 
million in us arms and other supplies to unita annually is 
supporting the angolan governments interpretation of the june 
accords president eduardo dos santos contends savimbi agreed to 
temporary exile and to integrating his forces into the angolan 
armed forces 
at a news conference here wednesday van dunem accused savimbi 
of not being willing really to commit himself to a process of 
peace he told reporters the united states should support the 
agreement reached last june including savimbis exile and the 
integration of his forces into the government military 
van dunem said he had conveyed these thoughts to members of the 
house of representatives subcommittee on africa and would tell 
secretary of state james baker the same thing when he meets him 
probably next week 
on tuesday sen jesse helms rnc complained at a hearing of 
the senate foreign relations committee that mobutu had cut the flow 
of us arms to savimbis forces asking herman j cohen assistant 
secretary of state for african affairs why that had been done 
cohen said that while it was an open secret that the united 
states has been aiding savimbi in his struggle against angolas 
marxist government details of the operation are classified 
helms said his question was not based on classified material and 
added i can say publicly that the supply lines have been cut and 
you and i know why and who did it helms asserted that mobutu 
got his hackles up because savimbi wouldnt knuckle under to the 
terms of the peace plan 
this week both sides are currying us support in meetings with 
administration officials members of congress and the media 
savimbi is arguing for continued us aid he already gets one 
of the largest sums of covert assistance and for support of free 
elections that would allow unita to share power 
angola is asking primarily for us recognition arguing that it 
has fulfilled washingtons main demand by agreeing to the 
withdrawal of more than 50000 cuban troops by 1991 us officials 
say the cuban pullout from angola is proceeding as planned but that 
diplomatic recognition will be withheld until the government agrees 
to free elections 
angola is backed by a coalition of advocacy groups that has 
organized media briefings and demonstrations against savimbi this 
week 
halfpage ads this week in the washington post and the new york 
times paid for by the angolan government said savimbi was a 
dictator here to press for more covert aid 
unita is represented by a prestigious array of lobbyists and 
public relations experts 
unita supporters on tuesday released the content of a letter 
written by sen orrin hatch rutah asking attorney general dick 
thornburgh to investigate a major angola supporter the transafrica 
lobbying organization 
hatch said transafrica may have violated the foreign agents 
registration act by accepting more than 2000 from the angolan 
mission to the united nations 
randall robinson the director of transafrica who just returned 
from a factfinding trip to angola said the money went to buy 
tickets for the organizations annual dinner in which some 50 
african and caribbean countries took part 
a justice department spokesman said the hatch request had been 
forwarded to the criminal division

troops loyal to gen manuel antonio 
noriega patrolled quiet streets today after crushing a coup 
attempt and a military spokesman said two coup leaders had taken 
refuge at a us army base 
a lawyer for noriega said the general was not detained or 
injured in tuesdays uprising and had been away from the defense 
forces headquarters in panama city when the fighting began 
it was the second failed attempt in 18 months by dissidents in 
the military to oust noriega the defense forces chief and de facto 
leader of panama 
noriega was quick to blame the revolt on the united states 
which has been trying to oust him for more than 1 years and bring 
him to the united states to face federal drug trafficking charges 
the proof is that american troops closed access routes to the 
barracks just as they closed the panamerican highway noriega 
said on nationwide television several hours after the failed coup 
by what appeared to be a small group of soldiers 
at the united nations in new york today panamas president 
francisco rodriguez also claimed that us troops blocked roads 
during the attempted coup there is proof evidence of all kinds 
that there was such support which the us armed forces in panama 
gave he told reporters he said photographs will be released 
later showing us tanks blocking the highways 
raul ossa the second vice president of the opposition christian 
democrats was arrested following the coup attempt according to a 
telex the party sent today to panamanian exiles in miami the 
statement did not say precisely when the arrest occurred or whether 
it was part of a larger roundup 
a defense forces spokesman maj edgardo lopez said two coup 
leaders including capt javier licona head of the cavalry 
squadron had taken refuge at fort clayton a us army base in 
panama city in washington a pentagon spokesman said he was unable 
to confirm lopezs account 
president bush denied any role in the rebellion but he 
reiterated that the united states would still like to see noriega 
ousted 
i want to see democracy in panama succeed bush said in 
washington tuesday night white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said the bush administration had some advance word that a coup 
attempt might be afoot 
some us congressional leaders said the united states should 
have helped the rebels 
once again we have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory 
and i think its an outrage said sen jesse helms rnc 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the united states 
reserves the right to use force against noriega but he dismissed 
armchair generals who criticized the administrations response 
noriega was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in the 
united states in february 1988 but he maintains those charges are 
part of a us plot to keep possession of the panama canal which 
reverts to panama at the end of the century 
he also annulled may elections after international observers 
said his slate of candidates had lost by a landslide 
the coup attempt began at the headquarters of the defense forces 
at about 7 am tuesday with the sound of gunshots and explosions 
echoing through the poor crowded downtown neighborhood police 
armored personnel carriers and water cannons blocked the 
surrounding streets some residents grabbed their belongings and 
ran 
sporadic shooting continued for several hours and the rebels 
read a communique on national radio saying they had toppled 
noriega loyalist troops later surrounded the headquarters compound 
and more fighting broke out 
noriega was away from headquarters at the time said raymond 
takiff one of several attorneys in miami representing noriega on 
drug charges takiff said he spoke with lopez today by telephone 
while noriega stood at lopezs side 
coup leaders knew he was not there so why they moved is a 
mystery takiff quoted lopez as saying 
us troops moved into position only a few hundred yards from 
the fighting and temporarily closed the main bridge over the canal 
but us spokesmen said those were only security measures 
the us troops did not take part in the fighting 
about 50000 americans live in panama including more than 
12000 us military personnel attached to the us southern 
command 
the united states never considered kidnapping noriega said a 
top pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
when it appeared as through noriega might have been dethroned 
there were several options considered none of which involved 
going in and getting him he declined to say exactly what options 
were weighed 
the progovernment newspaper critica said six members of the 
defense forces died in the coup attempt defense forces spokesman 
lopez would say only that a number of soldiers were wounded and 
refused to be more specific 
former opposition vice presidential candidate guillermo ford 
said at a new york news conference that noriega was not getting any 
stronger despite the crushing of the coup 
the mere fact that a group of officers young officers have 
attempted to overthrow him in my opinion is important enough that 
he must be getting the message loud and clear ford said 
although ford reported some civilian discontent he also 
admitted it was quickly put down i personally believe and i say 
this with a lot of sorrow that the panamanian people are highly 
intimidated by the regime said ford who was beaten bloody by 
thugs during a demonstration after his ticket won the may 7 
elections 
tuesdays coup attempt was more serious than a failed coup on 
march 16 1988 but it appeared that only elements of the urraca 
battalion which is in charge of security at defense forces 
headquarters were involved 
although the rebels only communique was signed by the battalion 
commander maj moises giraldi vega lopez said more than 60 
soldiers and four or five officers were being held prisoner far 
less than a full battalion 
noriega controls the country through his command of the defense 
forces and the failure of any other units to respond to the rebel 
call served to underline his control 
absolutely all other defense forces officers remained loyal 
to noriega according lopez 
that loyalty was visible in the swift reaction by the elite 
battalion 2000 and macho de monte units which moved into panama 
city to put down the uprising from bases respectively 25 and 55 
miles away 
at one point the rebels announced by radio that they had ousted 
noriega and a few hundred members of the civilian opposition went 
into the streets to celebrate but within half an hour noriega 
loyalists replied that the rebels were bluffing and the good cheer 
faded

the agriculture department said wednesday that 
the net income of farm cooperatives last year rose to nearly 17 
billion continuing a rebound from the sharp declines of the 
mid1980s 
combined business volume of cooperatives in 1988 was reported at 
663 billion up 103 percent from 602 billion in 1987 the 
record was 73 billion in 1984 
the 17 billion for net income was up 13 percent from 15 
billion in 1987 and was almost twoandahalf times the 1986 level 
of 688 million last years net income was exceeded only by 19 
billion in 1980 and 18 billion in 1976 
randall e torgerson administrator of the departments 
agricultural cooperative service attributed the 1988 growth 
primarily to droughtinduced higher prices for grains oilbearing 
crops and feed production of feed grains and soybeans dropped 
sharply because of last years drought 
total cooperative business volume includes the value of products 
sold by marketing coops the sales of farm supplies such as 
fertilizer chemicals fuels and feed to members and other 
customers and receipts from services such as trucking storage 
ginning and drying 
despite business increase the total number of coops and 
members continued a longtime downward trend in 1988 
torgerson said the number of coops dropped to 4939 from 5109 
primarily as the result of reorganizations through mergers 
consolidations and acquisitions memberships totaled 419 million 
down 56 percent from 1987 
the number of coop memberships is larger than the number of 
farms in the united states less than 22 million because many 
farmers belong to more than one cooperative memberships averaged 
848 per association compared with 869 in 1987

alexander m haig jr a former us secretary of 
state said wednesday the west must not drive china into isolation 
and recommended that a freeze on new credit be lifted 
haig the most prominent american to visit china since the army 
crackdown on prodemocracy protests june 34 said meetings with 
chinese leaders reassured him china is serious about keeping its 
doors open to the world 
regardless of your point of view haig said in an interview 
shortly before his departure we simply must continue to 
communicate with chinese leaders 
while in beijing for a business symposium haig met with premier 
li peng president yang shangkun and jiang zemin the new communist 
party chief he spoke briefly with senior leader deng xiaoping on 
the rostrum of tiananmen gate 
haig who heads a private consulting firm said the overriding 
imperative of western governments now is to avoid driving china 
into resentful and angry isolation 
he praised president bush for showing restraint on excessive 
overreaction but said the time had come to reconsider the policy 
backed by most western countries and japan of freezing action on 
new credit by such international lending institutes as the world 
bank 
withholding of new loans could affect the people of china 
he said and i dont think that should be restrained too much 
longer 
most western nations have halted highlevel official contacts 
and suspended arms sales as well as cutting off new credit to 
show their outrage over the chinese governments violent 
suppression of dissent 
the former secretary of state said the message to china should 
be we were mad we reacted but weve got to go on 
haig said chineseamerican contacts resumed 18 years ago have 
been fundamentally advantageous to world peace and regional 
stability 
us businesses must assess the risks of investing in china 
which in addition to political turmoil is undergoing an economic 
austerity program to combat excessive growth and serious gaps 
between supply and demand haig said 
he added referring to businesses already here i would not 
advise them to pick up stakes and pull out i still think 
theres a lot of good business to be done in china 
noting that 2025 percent of chinas gross national product is 
directly related to international commerce haig said even if 
there were an intention to reverse that it could not be done 
without serious repercussions which i dont think any leadership 
in china would risk 
china blames the united states for the current strain in 
relations contending that a nations relations with others should 
not be affected by its domestic policies

when it comes to holding down cholesterol when 
you eat may turn out to be as important as what you eat 
a study has found that people who nibble all day instead of 
eating three square meals have signficantly lower blood cholesterol 
levels 
the researchers said this means that cholesterol levels may be 
lowered by increasing meal frequency alone with no alteration in 
the nature or amount of the food eaten 
however they said they did not advocate putting people on the 
diet they tested which they described as an extreme model of 
nibbling 
in the study conducted at the university of toronto seven men 
ate 2500 calories a day for one twoweek period they got their 
food in three ordinarysize meals but for another two weeks they 
got the same amount of calories in 17 snacks eaten once an hour 
the nibbling diet lowered their total cholesterol levels by 9 
percent and their levels of hazardous lowdensity lipoprotein 
cholesterol or ldl by 14 percent 
nutritionists generally discourage people from eating this way 
because snackers tend to take in more calories over the course of 
the day and put on weight however some population studies suggest 
that those who eat frequently rather than gorging on one or two 
meals a day have healthier hearts 
the researchers said that what they found is consistent with 
the claim that increasing meal frequency while maintaining a 
constant caloric intake may have a role in the prevention of heart

the state seized control of jersey citys 
28000student school system today making it the biggest urban 
district in the nation to be taken over for failing to do its job 
state officials charged that the school system in the gritty 
impoverished community across the hudson river from new york city 
is academically bankrupt and rife with corruption mismanagement 
and patronage 
at least four other states have school takeover laws and two 
new mexico and kentucky have seized districts deemed failures 
the state board of education gave final approval to the takeover 
and appointed elena j scambio to a threeyear term as 
superintendent under new jersey law the state has five years to 
make improvements 
the move gives the state extraordinary power in jersey city the 
states secondlargest district and the first to be taken over by 
the state ms scambio can fire administrators abolish the local 
board of education and set policy 
the jersey city school system has a staff of 3322 and a budget 
for the current year of about 180 million 
enrollment is 44 percent black 34 percent hispanic and 13 
percent white fiftyfive percent of the students are involved in 
compensatory bilingual or special education programs 
todays decision was expected and ends a long process that was 
strongly pushed by gov thomas h kean who has billed himself 
the education governor 
ms scambio who will give up her job as essex county schools 
superintendent has vowed to make jersey city a national model of 
urban education but her immediate plans were unclear 
state board vice president robert a woodruff reading a 
resolution said the districts problems were deeprooted and 
endemic the jersey city board of education totally failed to meet 
its obligations 
there are severe longstanding deeprooted deficiencies 
permeating all aspects of the school system the resolution said 
the state had cited political intrusion in hiring poor test 
scores failure to provide a safe and clean environment violations 
of bidding laws failure to provide for handicapped children and 
unauthorized use of funds 
the idea of takeover does not come easily to me said 
education commissioner saul cooperman ive always believed the 
role of the state department is to help others help themselves 
cooperman said the state is initiating the takeover not 
because we want to its because we have to if not us who if not 
now when 
national education groups say they will closely monitor the 
takeover 
jean mcdonald a researcher for the national governors 
association said kentucky south carolina texas and new mexico 
have laws allowing state takeovers of failing districts 
she said laws in illinois and arkansas let the state eliminate 
deficient districts an ohio law allows the state to revoke a 
troubled districts charter and georgia may impose heavy financial 
penalties on such districts 
this summer an administrative law judge agreed state officials 
had the power to take over the district he noted that some of the 
districts textbooks are more than 30 years old 
jersey city officials bitterly fought the takeover saying the 
problems were caused by a prior administration and that the state 
trumped up its case against the district 
opponents also question whether the state can improve conditions 
in jersey city saying new jerseys system of funding schools has 
crippled urban districts

it began as a simple little bill to reduce the 
budget deficit by 53 billion but as tuesday night faded into 
wednesday morning the bill ballooned into a multibilliondollar 
package of tax goodies for a parade of special interests 
it was tax time at the senate finance committee and there were a 
lot of winners lowerincome parents some of the nations 
wealthiest retirees oil producers owners of tuxedo rental 
companies timber growers banana farmers rural hospitals 
firsttime homebuyers the selfemployed parents who adopt 
handicapped children 
and of course workers who want to use individual retirement 
accounts to shelter income from the taxman in the biggest fight of 
the day liberalized iras favored by most democrats won out over 
a cut in capitalgains taxes which republicans preferred 
that issue will be fought another day on the floor of the 
senate perhaps as early as friday 
when the deficitreduction bill with all its attached amendments 
is debated by the senate republicans will try to strike the ira 
provision and substitute a capitalgains cut for individuals and 
corporations they failed by a 1010 tie vote to do that in 
committee 
the gop plan provides that the longer an individual held a 
piece of property stock or other investment the less of the 
profit would be taxed when sold for example 95 percent of the 
profit from property sold after a year would be taxed 70 percent 
would be taxed if sold after six years 
that plan is patterned after president bushs proposal but 
considerably different from the one that the house with bushs 
endorsement adopted last week 
however the fight over capital gains and iras is decided and 
the final bill could contain parts of both most of the direct tax 
saving would go to people with incomes above 50000 a year 
while those issues will command the attention of the senate 
many other parts of the big deficitreduction bill will not even be 
mentioned in public debate 
this bill as it has progressed has become increasingly more 
troubling sen bill bradley dnj groused as the panel wound 
up action on the legislation just before 230 am wednesday we 
end up raising 37 billion in taxes over five years to meet a 
53 billion deficitreduction goal he said 
here are some of the scores of provisions that were tacked onto 
the bill by the committee 
new assistance to rural hospitals many of which are 
financially stressed because federal medicare reimbursements favor 
urban facilities 
expanding the oildepletion allowance for owners of wells that 
produce fewer than 15 barrels a day producers whose natural gas is 
in tight sand formations would get an additional incentive 
totaling 685 million over five years 
permitting banana and pineapple growers to use a more 
advantageous system of accounting a 25 million benefit 
a liberalized package of taxrelated aid to lowerincome 
families with children including a new credit for health insurance 
and supplements for families with children under age 4 
raising from the current 8880 to 14520 the annual amount a 
person age 65 through 69 may earn without losing a portion of 
social security benefits this would help fewer than 10 percent of 
beneficiaries those whose earnings exceed 8800 at a cost of 
1 billion a year 
reducing from five years to two years the minimum time period 
over which owners of rental tuxedo firms may depreciate their 
inventories saving owners 29 million over five years 
permitting deduction of certain costs of adopting hardtoplace 
children 
extending through 1991 expiring tax benefits for employerpaid 
legal and educational assistance and for health insurance costs 
for the selfemployed and making permanent credits designed to 
help firsttime homebuyers corporations that increase research 
spending and investors in lowincome rental housing 
restoring the incomeaveraging benefit for farmers they could 
use losses from bad years to offset taxes owed in good years 
allowing timber growers to avoid a 1986 requirement that they 
materially participate in managing a timber crop before using 
losses from such activity to offset taxes on other income 
granting amnesty from 1985 backward to taverns that have failed 
to pay an annual occupational tax 
allowing the use of taxexempt bonds to construct private spots 
stadiums 
requiring the social security administration to mail annual 
statements of earnings and benefits to all people 60 and older 
starting in 1995 beginning in 1999 annual statements would have 
to be mailed to every worker 
ensuring that the internal revenue service notify taxpayers who 
are entitled to refunds but neglect to claim them

a new educational group said wednesday that 
the agricultural export policies of the united states and the 
european economic community are linked to third world development 
sometimes to the disadvantage of poor countries 
the trade and development program was recently established to 
help educate americans about the importance of farm and trade 
policy to the third world 
we all need to make these vital connections between our food 
farmers and trade policy said the programs chairman walter 
grazer of the us catholic conference education of our citizens 
is critical so they can make informed decisions and join in the 
policy process 
the nonprofit washingtonbased program is sponsored by 10 
church and farm organizations and is funded by a grant from the 
wk kellogg foundation 
educational materials including video tapes have been prepared 
for use by farm church and community groups to explore the 
linkages between trade policies and third world development 
atherton martin former agriculture minister of the commonwealth 
of dominica a caribbean island nation said measures to help us 
and european farmers such as export subsidies on grains have 
damaged the fragile economies of developing countries 
the export push was stepped up by the 1985 farm law in which 
congress created export incentives or subsidies to sell more 
us commodities overseas partly in response to similar incentives 
in europe he said 
as a result the subsidized lower prices have helped consumers 
but often have hurt farmers and slowed agricultural development in 
many nations martin said 
in a report outlining its goals and some of the challenges the 
program said no attempt will be made to reach a consensus or to 
advocate specific trade and agricultural policies however it said 
sponsors share a number of views 
agricultural trade policies should be more sensitive to the 
interests of farmers farm workers consumers and poor people 
throughout the world 
broad participation in community national and international 
decision making is crucial 
individual and community stewardship supported by sound public 
policies is critical in the care and preservation of global 
resources 
the common goals also state that maintaining us family 
farmers and vital rural communities is important to the fabric of 
the nation and that these are important resources throughout the 
world 
moderatesized farms development projects or trading 
enterprises are generally preferable to largescale undertakings 
the report said 
the sponsors are bread for the world institute on hunger and 
development the center for rural affairs the evangelical lutheran 
church in america the friends committee on national legislation 
educational fund the national catholic rural life conference the 
national farmers organization the national farmers union the

it isnt tough to find a lawyer in rhode 
island the state bar association says theres one for every 265 
residents but for people in jail waiting two years or more for a 
trial criminal defense lawyers are almost an endangered species 
around the country those involved in the criminal justice 
system say the story is the same lawyers are fleeing criminal 
defense work for more lucrative business letting defendants 
languish in jail while the overworked attorneys who remain in the 
field are tied up on other matters 
its very difficult when one lawyer has 60 cases to dispose 
of those cases when hes on trial for two or three months in one 
of them said thomas f fay chief justice of the rhode island 
supreme court 
samuel dash former chief counsel to the senate watergate 
committee and now a georgetown university professor chaired an 
american bar association committee studying problems in the 
nations criminal court system 
the system is entirely snarled there are not enough defense 
lawyers prosecutors police officers and judges he said 
and more lawyers might give up their defense work especially in 
drug cases because the us supreme court said the government may 
seize lawyers fees if the money came from their clients illegal 
drug sales said neal sonnett president of the national 
association of criminal defense lawyers 
a lot of lawyers find themselves not litigating in defense of 
their client but in defense of their own fees sonnett said 
ive had lawyer after lawyer tell me they just dont want the 
hassle 
too few criminal lawyers can lead to hasty and poorly conceived 
plea bargains that let dangerous criminals go free or repeated 
trial delays that keep people in overcrowded prisons dash said 
james ryan chief of criminal prosecution in the rhode island 
attorney generals office said victims also become more reluctant 
to testify as time passes leading to more dismissed cases 
sixtyseven felony cases went to trial in 1988 in providence 
county which contains 60 percent of the states population the 
average time between indictment and verdict was 863 days or 23 
years ryan said 
the state supreme court in 1987 unanimously overturned a robbery 
conviction because a 2year delay caused largely by a cumbersome 
court scheduling system had robbed the defendant of his 
constitutional right to a speedy trial 
fay said the lawyer shortage is the main source of delays now 
that the scheduling system has been changed 
the united states has 725574 actively practicing lawyers 
according to the aba or approximately one for every 340 people 
sonnett estimated fewer than 50000 of them are defense lawyers 
including public defenders 
no one keeps tabs on how many of rhode islands 3700 lawyers do 
criminal defense work but several lawyers estimated the state has 
fewer than 20 private defense attorneys plus 32 in the public 
defenders office 
low salaries unpredictable hours and a lack of social status 
all drive young law school graduates away from criminal work rhode 
island defense lawyers say 
edwards amp angell rhode islands largest corporate law firm 
pays newly minted lawyers 55000 a year and some new york firms 
offer more than 80000 
the public defenders office where many criminal defense 
lawyers begin their careers pays slightly under 30000 said 
public defender richard m casparian 
indigent rhode island defendants are represented by 
courtappointed private lawyers if the public defender cannot take 
their cases because of a conflict of interest lawyers said those 
appointments would be a good way to help young defense attorneys 
get started if the fees 20 an hour out of court and 30 an hour 
in court were not so low 
there are plumbers who make more than that said defense 
lawyer john a macfadyen 
criminal lawyers also find their lives subject to unpredictable 
schedules of witnesses lawyers and judges to a much greater extent 
than civil lawyers said lawyer peter a dibiase 
youve got to get the courts permission to take a day off 
he said 
criminal work also carries the stigma of guilt by association 
pawtucket mayor brian j sarault a former defense lawyer spent 
part of his reelection campaign this year deflecting questions 
about a 9yearold state police affidavit linking him to two drug 
suspects he once represented 
who wants to dirty themselves by going out to the prison or 
representing someone whos accused of some heinous crime said 
john f cicilline defense attorney in several highprofile 
organized crime cases

about 10000 east german refugees 
began leaving prague for the west today and thousands of others 
reportedly lined the train route hoping to join their historic 
exodus 
on tuesday for the second time in a week east germanys 
communist leaders agreed to safe passage to the west for thousands 
of its citizens who had thronged west germanys embassy in prague 
the capital 
later in the day the leaders banned unrestricted travel into 
czechoslovakia in a desperate bid to stop the embarrassing exodus 
fourteen buses carrying the east germans from the embassy 
compound to pragues lieben train station left about 430 pm 
the first train carrying 1000 east germans departed prague 
about two hours later reporters at the station said 
fifteen trains were made available by the east german state 
railroad for the transfer the trains were to travel through east 
german territory via dresden to the west german border town of hof 
the trains were originally scheduled to leave earlier today but 
they were repeatedly delayed one report suggested that was because 
wouldbe emigres were jamming train stations along the route 
hoping to join the mass transfer 
the prague refugees waited through tuesday night in near 
freezing weather huddled in and around the embassy many in tents 
on the embassy garden which is roughly the size of a football 
field 
we couldnt survive a second night like this said a red 
cross official who requested anonymity 
in communist east berlin police scuffled today with 50 east 
germans attempting to gain entry to the us embassy witnesses 
said earlier officials said 18 east germans entered the embassy 
seeking passage to the west witnesses said about 100 east german 
police scuffled with the wouldbe refugees in front of the embassy 
there were no reports of injuries witnesses said police also 
cleared the area of 200 bystanders 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said of 
the situation at the us embassy were talking to the east 
germans about it and trying to get them to help resolve the problem 
through their emigration policies 
diplomatic sources also said that four east germans were seeking 
asylum in the west german mission in east berlin 
there were reports that thousands of wouldbe emigres in east 
germany were lining the route that trains carrying the refugees 
from czechoslovakia were to travel en route to west germany 
hungarian radio said the railroad station in dresden east 
germany was jammed with hundreds of people hoping to jump aboard 
the special trains but that east german police cleared the station 
however in frankfurt the hessische rundfunk radio said young 
east germans their bags packed had jammed other train stations 
along the route 
the radio quoted bavarian border police as saying the massive 
numbers in the stations were believed to be responsible for the 
delay in getting the east german trains into prague to pick up 
refugees there 
east germany agreed to have trains leaving czechoslovkia pass 
through east germany before heading west a facesaving measure for 
hardline ally czechoslovakia which had vowed not to let the east 
germans cross its borders to the west 
in bonn a west german foreign ministry spokesman peter rothen 
said today we have no reason to believe the train delay is due 
to anything other than technical difficulties 
however a west german government spokesman hans klein said on 
zdf television today that the wouldbe emigres lining the train 
route could be a reason for the delay in picking up prague refugees 
that would be a plausible reason that some people perhaps 
would have wanted to jump on the trains going by he said that 
would be normal in the current situation 
meanwhile more east germans flooded the west german embassy in 
warsaw poland bringing to 400 the number there who were demanding 
passage to west germany 
many of them their clothing still wet said they swam rivers 
and hid from police as they made their way to reformminded poland 
hoping to join the historic flight from east germany 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said in a 
radio interview that he expected a solution for the refugees in 
poland as well 
west germanys masscirculation bild newspaper reported that 
four east germans had fled to the west german embassy in sofia in 
communist bulgaria 
east german leader erich honecker accused west germany of trying 
to destabilize his country by encouraging the exodus which has 
severely drained its labor force of young skilled workers 
the rejection of its communist system is embarrassing east 
germanys leaders as they prepare to commemorate 40 years of 
statehood this weekend in ceremonies soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev is to attend 
bild reported today that gorbachev had pressured honecker into 
reaching a solution to the crisis the newspaper quoting no 
sources said that gorbachev let honecker know he was willing to 
come to the east german 40th anniversary celebrations only if the 
refugee problem were solved 
east berlins curb on free travel effectively cuts off easy 
escape routes for east germans who also had reached the west via 
hungary after that countrys liberal leaders opened their western 
border in midseptember 
hundreds of east germans stormed through police lines and 
climbed facades and rooftops to get inside the embassy compound on 
tuesday after crowding prompted west german officials to close it 
to more asylumseekers 
it is the latest wave of an exodus that this year already has 
seen more than 120000 east germans reached west germany where 
they are granted automatic citizenship

the bush administration under heavy pressure 
from congress to do more for the new government of poland today 
proposed a 200 million grant to help that country restructure its 
economy 
the aid which would require congressional approval would be in 
addition to 219 million in economic and food aid previously 
announced by the administration 
the proposal came as house and senate democrats proposed even 
larger sums of aid to the new solidarityled government than sought 
by bush and invited the labor unions leader lech walesa to 
address a joint meeting of congress on nov 15 to outline his hopes 
for polands future 
bush meanwhile invited both polands new prime minister 
tadesz mazowiecki and communist president wojciech jaruzelski to 
washington for consultations press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
in announcing the new aid 
the white house announcement follows agreement by the 12nation 
european community to back a 650 million package of aid for poland 
and hungary 
fitzwater said the us grant would complement the european 
package and would go toward a polish request for a 1 billion 
loan from the west however fitzwater said the administration 
favored a grant as its share rather than a loan so as not to add to 
polands already staggering debt 
the dramatic changes in poland over the past two months have 
lent new urgency to our efforts the spokesman said what 
poland is doing is historic in the largest sense of the word 
fitzwater said the money would be disbursed only after the 
polish government reachs agreement with the international monetary 
fund on an economic restructuring plan 
the united states also plans to send a team of experts business 
leaders and administration officials to poland so that we can 
provide the most effective help fitzwater said 
democratic leaders of both chambers joined tuesday to dismiss 
again bushs 219 million package of initiatives in eastern europe 
as grossly inadequate and timid 
they unveiled an aggressive democratic legislative program of 
grants and loans with a potential economic impact of more than 37 
billion 
the threeyear democratic package would be composed of loans 
from international financial institutions us loans and grants 
and a fiveyear halt in polish payments on its 25 billion us 
bank debt 
bold action today will be far less costly than timidity 
said house majority leader richard gephardt dmo for if we 
hesitate and the opportunity is lost we will be paying for it for 
a long long time in an escalating arms race 
gephardt said it was ironic that a government that doubled us 
military spending to respond to a soviet military threat now 
seems curiously paralyzed unable to respond to the possibility of 
economic freedom democracy and peace breaking out in eastern 
europe 
but raymond seitz assistant secretary of state for european 
affairs denied such paralysis exists saying polands new plan for 
restructuring its centralized economy is in many respects a 
declaration of economic independence 
seitz told the house foreign affairs european subcommittee a 
polish request for a 1 billion loan to stabilize the economy is 
under very active review at very high levels there will be a 
response to that shortly 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the subcommittee said 
the bush administration has established a clear pattern when it 
comes to aid to poland and hungary 
the president puts forward a proposal that is seen to be 
inadequate pressure builds up to do more and the president puts 
forward another inadequate proposal hamilton said 
he is only moving in that direction because he is being 
pressured by the congress 
the invitation to walesa to address a joint meeting of congress 
was extended by house speaker thomas s foley dwash and senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine who said the solidarity 
leader has come to represent the yearning for freedom and 
economic opportunity that people feel in eastern europe and the 
world over 
guiding solidarity to negotiate a transition toward free 
elections and then achieving a sweeping mandate from the people and 
then to take responsibility for the polish government is close to a 
modern political miracle mitchell said 
the democratic aid package includes 887 million in new us 
economic and food assistance to poland and hungary of which it is 
contemplated that 415 million would be appropriated for use in the 
1990 fiscal year that began sunday 
democrats said the us funds would be obtained by trimming 
appropriations for other programs but didnt identify what specific 
programs would be cut

a lebanese hijacker convicted of commandeering 
a jetliner in beirut in 1985 with two americans aboard was 
sentenced wednesday to 30 years in prison 
fawaz younis grabbed by fbi agents aboard a yacht in 1987 and 
brought to the united states to stand trial told us district 
court judge aubrey robinson that i am not a member of any 
terrorist group 
younis said the two americans on the jordanian airliner were 
treated as friends by the hijackers during a 30hour ordeal 
over the mediterranean sea that ended with the 70 passengers and 
crew members being freed the hijackers then blew up the aircraft 
the judge ordered younis to serve 30 years for hostage taking 
20 years for aircraft piracy and five years for conspiring to take 
hostages following his march 14 conviction by a jury on three of 
six criminal charges the sentences are to run concurrently 
after the sentencing youniss attorney frank carter promised 
to appeal the case on 20 different issues he said that the 
question of us jurisdiction is a critical one and that i dont 
think it the hijacking had anything to do with americans 
whatsoever 
assistant us attorney ramsey johnson urged robinson to impose 
a sentence of life imprisonment but the judge said he wouldnt 
because no one was killed in the hijacking jordanian sky marshals 
aboard the plane were beaten but there was testimony at youniss 
trial that he ordered the violence stopped 
but the judge said a lengthy sentence must be imposed because 
time will never wipe out in the minds of the passengers and 
crew the terror they experienced 
us attorney jay stephens called the sentence substantial 
and fair adding that it vindicates the victims and sends a 
clear message to anyone who would engage in acts of 
international terrorism 
having spent the last two years in custody younis will be 
eligible for parole in eight years said stephens 
but carter predicted that younis will never be paroled and 
that he will have to serve at least 20 years of his sentence with 
credit for the two he already has served federal prisoners 
generally serve out twothirds of their terms unless paroled 
carter said the federal law giving the government authority to 
prosecute younis focuses on taking into custody someone who has 
slipped into the united states after committing an illegal act 
abroad in this instance the fbi reached out and dragged him 
here said carter 
younis was lured aboard a yacht in the mediterranean on sept 
13 1987 with the prospect of a drug deal and a party according 
to testimony at his trial 
a member of the lebanese amal movement younis told the judge he 
had been kidnapped by fbi agents he carried out the hijacking 
because he received an order from his military commander who 
is neither a terrorist nor a bloodthirsty beast younis said 
in a statement he read to the judge 
i exerted maximum effort to guarantee safety and return to 
beirut said younis 
at his trial younis testified that he was instructed by his 
superiors to fly the plane to tunis tunisia where a meeting of 
arab league representatives was in progress 
during the hijacking he read a declaration demanding the league 
decide that one arab nation allow all palestinians to settle there 
and that palestinians be removed from lebanon 
had i been with the contra forces in central america would 
that be terrorism or would he be considered one of the 
freedomfighters younis asked the judge

an oregon couple who lost an environmental 
lawsuit against their county on a technicality won some sympathy 
at least at the supreme court on wednesday 
during an hourlong hearing the justices showed little 
inclination to restore the victory it took olaf and mary hallstrom 
three years and 95000 to win 
your case is an appealing one justice antonin scalia told 
the hallstroms lawyer but noted that asking the court to interpret 
a federal law contrary to its clear language is risky business 
the hallstroms victory was overturned because their lawyer had 
failed to notify federal and state environmental officials as 
required by the law under which they sued before filing the 1982 
suit 
that lawyer kim buckley of portland urged the justices 
wednesday to look at the spirit of the resource conservation 
and recovery act one of at least a dozen federal environmental 
laws that gives private citizens the right to sue for enforcement 
at issue is a narrow but potentially significant point of 
environmental law one that may affect the success of private 
citizen enforcement 
the hallstroms suit contended that a county landfill adjacent 
to whats left of their 200acre dairy farm caused or contributed 
to the pollution of their water supply 
the couples lawyer informed the county of their intention to 
sue well before the 60day period required by the federal law but 
buckley did not give the same required notification to the federal 
environmental protection agency or the oregon department of 
environmental quality 
a federal judge however allowed the lawsuit to proceed and in 
1985 ordered the county to remedy federal environmental law 
violations within two years 
the judge turned down the hallstroms request for 95000 in 
attorney fees and the couple appealed 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in 1987 ruled that the 
hallstroms suit should have been dismissed before any trial 
because of the failure to notify 
that left the hallstroms at square one with the option of 
filing a new lawsuit 
its just not fair to make the hallstroms jump through a 
judicial hoop that has no purpose buckley told the nations 
highest court 
he argued that reinstating the hallstroms victory would 
effectuate the will of congress to protect the environment 
but several justices voiced concern over straying from the 
clearly worded notification requirement that congress included in 
the law 
justice anthony m kennedy spoke about the need for a rule 
that everyone can understand 
justice sandra day oconnor while noting that interpreting the 
law as written results in an unfortunate situation in this 
case said the law is workable as written 
the court was urged by i franklin hunsaker a portland lawyer 
representing the county to uphold the circuit courts ruling so 
government agencies can assess environmental messes before lawsuits 
are filed over them 
hunsaker said treating the 60day notice provision as mandatory 
assures predictability and evenhandedness in the administration 
of this law 
bush administration lawyer brian j martin said the epa agreed 
that dismissal of the hallstroms suit is required 
a supreme court decision is expected by july 
the case is hallstrom vs tillamook county 8842

east germans jammed western 
embassies swam rivers and lined railroad tracks in at least four 
warsaw pact nations tuesday in a desperate bid to catch what could 
be the last freedom trains to the west 
the flood of wouldbe east german emigres in czechoslovakia 
poland bulgaria and east germany came as the beleaguered 
government in east berlin said it would allow one more exodus of 
disillusioned citizens 
the statement covered an estimated 11000 weary refugees who had 
converged on the west german embassy in prague but there were 
reports thousands of others throughout the east bloc were hoping 
take part 
in prague the first of 15 trains began carrying east germans to 
the west on wednesday evening 
we knew it was our last chance one of the east germans told 
reporters before departing we were right now the border is 
closed 
east germany hoping to end the embarrassing exodus of its 
young skilled citizens before the communist nation celebrates its 
40th anniversary this weekend on tuesday closed its border with 
ally czechoslovakia to keep its people home 
because czechoslovakia was the only nation where east germans 
could travel without receiving special permission thousands had 
streamed here to seek asylum 
the clampdown on travel also was likely to severely curb the 
number of east germans going to reformminded hungary which 
spurred the exodus last month by allowing thousands of east germans 
to pass through the shortest route to hungary from east germany is 
through czechoslovakia 
west german border guards noted that only 500 had arrived via 
hungary on tuesday compared to 700 the day before and 1000 the 
day before that 
east germans were frantically trying other avenues to catch what 
they feared would be their last chance to reach west germany where 
they are granted automatic citizenship 
in east berlin police wednesday scuffled with about 50 east 
germans trying to enter the us embassy witnesses said eighteen 
others made it inside the compound tuesday us diplomatic sources 
said 
this is our last hope said one refugee in the group of 10 
adults and eight children were not going to budge until we know 
well be able to leave 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
bush administration was talking to east german diplomats to resolve 
the crisis 
in east germany in general there were reports of thousands of 
frantic citizens lining the rail route that the weekend freedom 
train had taken 
police beat people with truncheons to disperse a defiant crowd 
of 5000 that packed a dresden train station and lined the tracks 
chanting we want out witnesses told the associated press 
the trains were to travel through east german territory via 
dresden to the west german border town of hof the detour through 
east germany was requested by east berlin authorities so that the 
refugees could be formally expelled from their country 
czechoslovakia had vowed not to let east germans emigrate to the 
west across its borders 
according to reliable east german sources four east germans 
still were seeking asylum in the west german mission in east berlin 
there were also unconfirmed reports that four east germans had 
sought asylum in bonns embassy in sofia bulgaria 
in warsaw poland the number of east germans seeking asylum at 
the bonn embassy swelled to 400 about 130 arrived wednesday many 
their clothing still wet told of swimming rivers and evading 
border police to get to the embassy 
east germanys state railroad provided 15 trains to transport 
the 10000 east germans who had crowded the prague embassy and the 
streets just outside it 
the trains had been scheduled to leave tuesday night but were 
repeatedly delayed 
west german officials first said technical difficulties appeared 
to be the reason however later they said it could have been due 
to the east germans lining the tracks in their own country hoping 
to join the exodus 
that would be a plausible reason that some people perhaps 
would have wanted to jump on the trains going by west german 
government spokesman hans klein told the zdf television network 
refugees in and around the baroque palace that houses the 
embassy fought the bitter cold with hot tea huddling under 
blankets or wrapping themselves in jackets sent out by those who 
had found a place inside the building 
parents cradling children sat in the littered street outside 
inside the embassy garden about the size of a football field the 
trim lawns were trudged to a sea of mud 
police in the west german border town of hof said about 1000 
young east germans were waiting along the tracks near plauen an 
east german town near the czechoslovak border 
hungarian and west german media reported thousands more had 
crowded other spots along the route the trains were expected to 
take 
on sunday about 7000 east germans arrived in west germany 
after east germany allowed thousands crowded in embassies in prague 
and warsaw to leave many of those who arrived said they had jumped 
on board as the trains passed through their homeland

the nations only university was closed 
wednesday after thousands of students protesting the arrests of two 
student leaders clashed with hundreds of riot police fifty 
students were arrested 
all 8000 students were ordered to leave the university of 
zimbabwe campus by noon thursday police sealed off entrances to 
the campus as darkness fell riot squads barred students from 
entering the campus 
the violence began after the arrests of student council 
officials arthur mutambara and enock chikweche in a leaflet 
distributed before the start of classes student leaders called for 
a meeting to discuss the arrests 
the leaflet alleged police surrounded and stormed a campus 
residence and that mutambara was profusely bleeding after 
jumping from a secondfloor window in an effort to escape police 
student leaders said they believed mutambaras arrest was 
prompted by a statement he issued oct 2 criticizing the government 
and university authorities 
the university of zimbabwes vice chancellor walter kamba 
announced the closing at a news conference after conferring with 
president robert mugabe 
kamba called the move regrettable and sad and said it was a 
university decision and not the governments 
but student leaders who requested anonymity told the 
associated press they believed mugabe had personally ordered the 
shutdown because of widespread student disillusionment with the 
leadership over toplevel corruption 
about 4000 students boycotted classes and many fought running 
battles with batonwielding riot squads through the day a student 
spokesman said rioters threw stones at police and smashed the 
windows of a limousine used by kamba 
sporadic clashes continued throughout the day and the 
semiofficial zimbabwe inter african news agency said more than 50 
protesters were arrested they could face up to five years in 
prison students said police injured several protesters 
in the past year college students have staged several 
demonstrations in which they accused the government of stifling 
free expression and curbing academic freedoms they also have 
protested official corruption 
education minister fay chung has called students hooligans and 
drunkards who were being manipulated by political opponents to 
attack the government

with a flip of a stripe an artist 
accidentally turned the west german flag into the belgian flag on 
31000 tshirts mugs and other souvenirs for the citys 
oktoberfest 
this could be an international incident city council member 
david mann said tuesday 
the graphic artist hired by organizers of the festival held 
sept 1617 said he moved a vertical red stripe from the middle to 
the right side of the german flag to keep the color from blending 
with the events red logo 
the resulting blackorangered combination is the belgian flag 
kelly pharmer of decatur ill who came to cincinnati to visit 
friends noticed the problem and wrote the city council 
its one thing to mess around with words but not a countrys

an apparently sympathetic supreme court was 
urged wednesday to bolster communities power to crack down on 
adult bookstores xrated movie theaters and other sexually 
oriented businesses 
several justices vigorously challenged claims that a dallas 
licensing ordinance violates the constitutions freespeech 
guarantees while they seemed to react more warmly to arguments by 
a lawyer for dallas supporting the ordinance 
john h weston a beverly hills calif lawyer representing the 
sex trade in dallas said the ordinances broad authority to deny 
licenses is an unlawful prior restraint on free expression 
the local law goes well beyond traditional government regulation 
of public health and safety weston argued during a 60minute high 
court hearing were not dealing with nuclear power plants he 
said 
the law means one may not disseminate speech one has chosen to 
disseminate absent a permit he said it permits the city to 
do indirectly what it cannot do directly 
the court previously has empowered cities to use zoning laws to 
limit the locations of sexually explicit businesses requiring them 
to be concentrated in one area or spread out but a ruling in the 
dallas case expected by july could give communities enhanced 
control through licensing laws 
the ordinance which took effect in june requires sexually 
oriented businesses to obtain a license issued by the city police 
chief who has broad discretion to deny one licenses are denied to 
anyone convicted of various sex crimes such as obscenity and 
promoting prostitution 
weston argued that bookstores and other businesses engaged in 
disseminating speech should be given special consideration he 
said that they should be granted licenses to operate within a 
reasonable time unless public officials can prove there is a good 
reason to deny them a permit 
chief justice william h rehnquist said there is no precedent 
for giving special consideration to bookstores that seek business 
licenses 
justice antonin scalia in frequently barbed questioning said 
to weston you mean that every bookstore cannot be subject to 
normal business licensing 
dallas city attorney analeslie muncy defended the ordinance as a 
key weapon against crime and urban decay 
the licensing rules are aimed at businesses that are 100 
percent sexually oriented she said 
she said nothing prevents businesses from distributing their 
wares in other ways 
they can sell the same material through the mails 
doortodoor or on a street corner she said 
several justices questioned whether the ordinance goes too far 
in denying licenses also to anyone living with someone previously 
convicted of a sex crime 
but scalia came to mrs muncys aid by suggesting that provision 
legitimately would prevent evasion of the law by an exconvict 
who wants to transfer ownership of the business to a roommate or 
livein lover 
the ordinance is being challenged by owners of adult bookstores 
motion picture theaters nightclubs and motels but it also applies 
to nudemodel studios and sexualencounter establishments 
the ordinance also bars motel owners from renting rooms for less 
than 10 hours a provision intended to discourage prostitution and 
establishments offering sexually oriented entertainment must be 
open to surveillance by authorities without search warrants 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the local law 
saying it is a lawful attack on urban blight crime and declining 
property values 
several groups have joined the dallas business owners in 
attacking the ordinance they include the american booksellers 
association the association of american publishers the national 
association of college stores and the freedom to read foundation 
citizens for decency through law and the american family 
association lined up to support the dallas ordinance 
the case is fwpbs vs dallas 872012

fireball that killed three other crew members

the 160foot metalhulled boat hit the pipeline just before dark 
tuesday a halfmile offshore 
four coast guard boats and several private vessels searched 
today and the agency launched a helicopter after fog lifted coast 
guard and private helicopters with searchlights swept the area 
through the night until fog set in 
the pilot of a privatelyowned helicopter spotted the third 
victim just after noon today the coast guard recovered the body 
it was just a boom and big ball of fire went up into the air 
about 300 feet said allen willett a helicopter pilot for a 
company that ferries crews and gear to offshore drilling rigs as 
soon as i saw what it was i radioed back in and they notified the

the panamanian rebels who tried to oust gen 
manuel antonio noriega had him in their clutches for several 
hours according to some us officials who said today they are 
mystified as to why the insurgents let him go 
the spokesman for president bush said we dont really know 
if that was the case and an attorney who represents noriega 
disputed the account 
the officials asking not to be identified said noriega was in 
the custody of the rebels for four to five hours after taking over 
the defense force headquarters tuesday 
its crazy i dont understand it one official said when 
asked why the insurgents decided to free noriega 
the account was disputed by one of noriegas miamibased 
lawyers raymond takiff who said the general was away from the 
headquarters when the fighting began takiff said he spoke with 
defense force spokesman edgardo lopez while noriega stood at 
lopezs side 
shortly before the rebellion was put down tuesday afternoon 
jose blandon a former noriega aide told reporters in washington 
that he was informed by one of the leaders of the insurrection by 
telephone that noriega had been wounded while in rebel custody 
but when noriega made a brief public appearance after the 
rebellion was defeated there was no obvious indication of any 
injury 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said today that the 
rebels on tuesday indicated they had noriega in custody but 
we dont really know if that was the case 
he said these individuals whom he described as lowlevel also 
made it clear they werent willing to give up noriega to face 
drug trafficking charges in the united states the spokesman added

copies of a rembrandt angel winged their way 
around the world via fax wednesday lighting in amsterdam 
jerusalem and tokyo to commemorate the 320th anniversary of the 
artists death 
rembrandt would have liked this said max alexenberg the 
american artist responsible for the electronic event saying the 
master was himself something of a technology buff using the latest 
equipment and techniques then available 
i feel like im painting on a global canvas said 
alexenberg a fothen he enlarged the computers stark rendition of the 
drawing 
into a 6 by 4 foot angel divided into 24 sections to fit into a 
fax machine 
this faxart event reminds us that the electronic revolution 
is the most farreaching in human history alexenberg said in a 
written statement defining his work it is reshaping our 
experience of space and time and redefining art 
while americans now fax everything from restaurant orders to job 
resumes few probably realize that a crude telegraphic prototype of 
what eventually became the fax machine was invented in 1842 by 
alexander bain a scottish physicist and clockmaker according to 
atampt 
the machines popularity slowly increased over the past three 
decades then went wild in recent years 
laura abbott an atampt spokeswoman said industry experts predict 
the number of fax machines installed will triple worldwide from 3 
million in 1989 to 9 million in 1992

the united mine workers strike against 
pittston coal group is growing more divisive and expensive to both 
sides as it turns 6 months old thursday but the costs are 
remarkably even 
contract talks are on hold and the union leadership has raised 
the stakes of the strike by using mass demonstrations to choke off 
coal shipments 
the umw with a 100 million national strike fund has been 
fined 254 million for illegal strike activities mostly for 
efforts to disrupt coal production by replacement workers 
the union also has been paying each of pittstons 1695 union 
employees from virginia west virginia and kentucky 200 a week 
from the fund since they went on strike april 5 
in the first three months of the strike the second financial 
quarter pittston reported losses of 36 million compared with 9 
million in profits the same quarter in 1988 
umw research director mike buckner said financial statements 
from the next three months coming out in a few weeks will show the 
company losing at least as much in potential revenue or 252 
million over six months 
pittston also has a strike kitty a 100 million line of credit 
the company received in late 1987 buckner said 
we have charged that that is a strike breaking fund he said 
a russell county judge is expected to take away more umw chips 
by once again fining the union this time for taking over 
pittstons main coal preparation plant for four days in late 
september the most dramatic act of civil disobedience of the 
strike 
umw vice president cecil roberts said similar unarmed invasions 
and occupations to cut off coal shipments will be mounted soon 
regardless of the cost 
this strike has been very expensive already roberts said 
he added were prepared to do whatever it takes to win 
the union has said all along that money has little to do with 
this labor dispute the main issues are not wages but job security 
and health benefits for retired workers 
if we have to spend money to win this strike then were going 
to spend it buckner said 
asked whether the union could afford the drain on the strike 
fund buckner said the question is can we afford not to protest 
pittstons actions 
pittston president mike odom declined to discuss specifics of 
production or financial losses but he said the violence and 
blatant violation of our rights under the law has cost the company 
a substantial amount of money during the six months of the strike 
the union claims pittstons production is about onethird of its 
normal output tax records in the counties where pittston has mines 
show substantial decreases in the amount of coal coming out of the 
ground 
however records at virginia ports show little change in coal 
shipments since the strike began shipments by all companies using 
the ports has increased 20 percent through august from about 25 
million tons to about 30 millions tons said john randolph 
director of the virginia center for coal and energy research 
there is little data to show any dramatic effects on pittston 
operations or on virginia production he said 
buckner and coal industry analysts say that is because pittston 
is buying highpriced coal from other companies to fulfill its 
contracts 
that is indicative of the severity of the economic 
difficulties the company is having with this strike buckner said 
to block coal shipments the union contends were bound for 
pittstons preparation plants umw president richard trumka ordered 
selective strikes that began early monday at two mines in kentucky 
and five in west virginia 
about 350 umw employees walked off their jobs monday and a union 
official said there was no way to tell how long that would last

the senate agriculture committee chairman on 
wednesday criticized president bushs choice for a top natural 
resources job as more concerned about pleasing special interests 
than protecting the public trust 
in government the public interest has to come first sen 
patrick leahy told james cason the nominee for assistant secretary 
of agriculture for natural resources and the environment during 
confirmation hearings 
cason 35 has been a highranking official in the interior 
department since 1982 and is acting head of land and minerals 
management 
leahy said as a government official casons one assignment has 
been to protect the public interest 
time and time again he has failed that assignment said 
leahy who grilled cason during two days of hearings on decisions 
he made at interior 
when it came to protecting the spotted owl mr cason chose 
timber interests over the public welfare the senator said in his 
closing statement 
when it came to getting tough on oil and gas companies who 
were not paying their fair share of royalties the decisions were 
made behind closed doors key parties were excluded from meetings 
leahy said cason tried to stop the government from collecting 
oil royalties even where evidence of collusion or underpayment 
among companies existed 
during questioning leahy said cason changed an audit system 
when the oil industry reacted negatively to it even though it was 
designed to collect millions of dollars in underpaid royalties owed 
the indian tribes and the state and federal governments 
cason stopped audits of any leases negotiated before 1980 but 
allowed oil companies to continue collecting overpayments from the 
government for those leases said leahy 
cason said that by concentrating on audits of leases after 1980 
and eliminating the ones that came earlier the department was 
merely making the best use of its audit staff 
in addition cason said the government could make more money 
through the post1980 audits 
leahy chastised cason for not consulting with the states or the 
indian tribes before eliminating the pre1980 audits 
its like a judge in a divorce case locking the wife out of 
the courtroom and dealing only with the husband said leahy 
sen thomas daschle dsd questioned casons management 
abilities saying a general accounting office report showed that a 
system under casons jurisdiction for finding mining law violators 
has been defective for four years 
cason blamed the computer system and said the problems were 
being worked out 
daschle said it says something about management when after 
four years it didnt get better 
cason assured leahy that if confirmed he would work with the 
committee to set agriculture department policy 
we have a plethora of statutes that require us to do some very 
difficult things he said during the confirmation process i 
have learned a lot i have been exposed to new opinions

the environmental protection agency announced 
lawsuits and penalties wednesday against 11 cities including 
detroit phoenix and san antonio accusing them of allowing 
untreated toxic industrial chemicals into public sewage systems 
the action is the latest in a stepped up effort by the epa in 
recent months to force municipalities to take action against 
industrial plants that do not pretreat toxic chemicals before 
discharging them into public sewers 
the latest suits brought to 61 the number of cities that have 
been targets of either administrative fines or civil lawsuits this 
year for violations of federal water pollution laws in connection 
with the toxic industrial discharges 
we are sending a message a very clear message declared epa 
administrator william reily no individual no industry no 
municipality will be allowed to violate environmental laws without 
the risk of sanctions and penalties 
he said the enforcement actions reflected cases that long have 
been under scrutiny from the epa and where consistent problems 
exist in gettng local officials to assure that all industrial toxic 
wastes are pretreated before being allowed into public sewage 
systems 
attorney general dick thornburgh who joined reilly at the news 
conference announcing the latest lawsuits said the actions reflect 
our determination not to sit idly by while our waters continue to 
be befouled 
we simply cannot allow harmful pollutants to reach our rivers 
and streams untreated continued thornburgh adding that the 
lawsuits are not likey to be the last such actions 
according to epa estimates there are more than 870 million 
pounds of toxic industrial chemicals including cyanide arsenic 
and hazardous heavy metals such as cadmium and lead dumped into 
public sewage treatment systems each year 
these wastes which are combined with normal sewage and after 
further treatment are released into open waters are legal as long 
as the toxics are pretreated at the source when not pretreated 
they can damage public sewage treatment equipment pose hazards to 
workers interfere with the degradation of biological wastes 
already in the system and contaminate fish and shellfish in open 
waters officials said 
nevertheless the epa estimates that onethird of the public 
sewage treatment facilities covered by federal law dont adequately 
monitor such pretreatment or take adequate action against violators 
the four lawsuits filed wednesday were against detroit whose 
cityrun sewage treatment facility treats wastes from more than 400 
industrial users phoenix ariz where public sewage systems carry 
wastes from 100 industrial plants and san antonio and el paso 
texas which together have about 130 industrial users san antonio 
agreed as part of the suit to pay 225000 for past violations 
officials said 
officials said other lawsuits filed earlier this week were 
against beaumont tex dunkirk ny easton and punxsutawney 
pa and gloucester mass in addition consent agreements were 
reached this week with nacogdoches tex and bellefonte pa for 
60000 and 64000 penalties respectively 
the federal actions allege that the cities have not adequately 
identified the industrial discharges allowed discharges in ome 
cases without proper permits didnt screen samples of the 
wastewater to determine if industrial plants were in compliance 
and failed to take action against polluters violating the 
pretreatment requirements 
jessica landman an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council praised the epa and justice department action but 
maintained it was only a first step in getting reluctant 
municipalities to get tough with industrial polluters 
often she said its like putting the fox in charge of the 
henhouse because in many cases the industrial polluter also is a 
significant political and economic power in a community 
last april a report of the practices of 502 municipal sewage 
treatment plants by the general accounting office the 
congressional watchdog agency also concluded that many cities are 
reluctant to take strong action against industrial polluters 
because of local political pressure and fears the companies might 
move elsewhere 
the gao findings came before the epa began its stepped up 
enforcement program aimed at cityrun sewage treatment facilities 
nationwide 
of the 61 cases including the 11 begun this week where 
administrative action or lawsuits have been initiated this year 
about a third ended with fines totaling more than 21 million 
including a 11 million civil penalty paid last august by denver 
the epa is seeking another 19 million in penalties in the two 
dozen cases that remain open a figure that will increase when 
proposed penalties are added from the latest round of lawsuits 
officials said 
but some environmentalists question whether even those fines 
some as low as 2000 are enough noting the maximum allowed is 
25000 per violation a sum that in some cases could mean millions 
of dollars in fines against a city

the upcoming edition of the places rated almanac which

pine bluff at the bottom but the publisher declines to confirm the 
rating 
its sort of like blackmail or something a violation of 
character mrs robinson said its like a character 
assassination of your city 
when the last almanac appeared in 1985 pine bluff was second to 
last among 329 places the new edition to be published by prentice 
hall in new york hits the sales racks nov 1 
the ratings are based on cost of living climate 
transportation education crime jobs arts recreation and 
health and the environment 
mrs robinson and civic leaders publicly challenged the 1985 
rankings but time around she said she wont defend pine bluff 
because that only seemed to draw more attention to the ranking 
pat lile vice president for community development of the 
greater pine bluff chamber of commerce said the ratings are just 
the sizzle that sells the book 
how can you compare pine bluff with a 63000 population with 
a city of new yorks size its like comparing apples and 
oranges mrs robinson said

mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
told a joint meeting of congress on wednesday his nation intends 
to eradicate drug trafficking at its very roots 
but salinas who is on a state visit to the united states 
warned that at the world level we are losing he said that was 
unacceptable and called for greater cooperation between 
governments to turn the tide 
while vowing an allout effort to curb drug trafficking salinas 
firmly ruled out joint usmexican military operations to fight 
the traffickers 
the responsibility for the fight in our country is exclusively 
ours he said there will be no joint military operations on 
our soil 
mexico intends to eradicate drug trafficking at its very roots 
in the sphere that falls under its responsibility salinas said 
speaking in spanish while his audience of senators and house 
members read from english translations 
drug smuggling and the alleged corruption of many mexican law 
enforcement authorities have led to complaints in congress that 
have at times been so strident they have been dubbed mexico 
bashing 
salinas appeared to be appealing for an end to this saying 
the time has come to build a new relationship free of myths and 
distrust abuses and recriminations 
he said that the worldwide fight against drug trafficking also 
is shared by mexico but that mutual accusations about who is to 
blame for the multibillion scourge waste time and effort 
in mexico we now affirm that drugtrafficking is a threat to 
national sovereignty because as in other nations it corrupts 
whatever it touches salinas said 
later in a speech at the national press club salinas said 
mexico will provide no haven and no sanctuary for narcotics 
trafickers 
we will hit them where it hurts in the pocket and in their 
personal liberty he said 
the mexican president also used his speech to congress to renew 
his appeal for greater mexican access to us markets saying that 
while mexico has eliminated most nontarrif barriers to us 
products we continue confronting them in the united states 
salinas described this as an inequitable paradox and said 
mexico must have greater and more secure access to the worlds 
greatest market the united states to obtain the economic growth 
that is needed to improve the lot of its people 
us officials disagree with salinas portrayal of the united 
states as a protectionist nation they say twothirds of mexicos 
exports come to the united states and that mexico had a 27 
billion surplus in its us trade last year on total twoway trade 
of about 44 billion

foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher on wednesday rejected charges from east berlin that bonn 
sparked the exodus of east germans to the west to destabilize 
communist east germany 
they believe in west germany that they can destabilize east 
germany with a broadbased attack but it will not work east 
german leader erich honecker said in a speech earlier this week 
the staterun berliner zeitung in the communist capital accused 
west germany of trying to provoke conflict and increase tension 
in europe by allegedly luring the refugees 
genscher rejected those charges in a radio interview wednesday 
and again called for reforms rejected by east berlins communist 
leadership 
a reform movement can only be carried out with political 
stability genscher said in an interview with norddeutsche 
rundfunk the federal government is opposed to any 
destabilization by words or deeds 
government officials in bonn also have denied east german 
allegations that west germany is attracting the refugees with false 
promises 
still west german employers and government officials have made 
no secret of their delight in having the refugees whose numbers 
have topped 43000 since hungary opened its borders to the west on 
sept 11 
most of the refugees are young skilled workers who ordinarily 
would form the backbone of the east german economy east germany 
already has admitted that the countrys dissatisfied work force is 
suffering 
genscher made it clear bonn has no intention of changing course 
to placate east germany 
the west german embassies will stay open genscher said 
the latest arrivals headed to bavaria from the west german 
embassy in prague 
despite the war of words between the two countries numerous 
questions remain as to whether west germany has an ulterior motive 
in welcoming newcomers to one of europes most densely populated 
countries 
the latest wave in the exodus comes just days before the 40th 
anniversary of the founding of east germany and some east german 
officials say bonn is trying to embarrass it during the planned 
celebrations 
many politicians in bonn also are looking ahead to the era after 
the rule of erich honecker the 77yearold leader of east germany 
chancellor helmut kohls government has vowed to continue pressing 
east berlin to make political reforms even though there are no 
indications that honeckers successor will be interested in 
undertaking them 
beyond that west german leaders are looking forward even more 
eagerly to their goal of reunification with east germany which 
they say can only come about if the two countries are joined in a 
westernstyle democratic system 
east germany also has accused west germany of supporting the 
growing opposition movement within the communist country

a federal judge on wednesday dismissed the 
core of the nations largest comparable worth lawsuit a claim 
that california deliberately underpaid thousands of women in 
femaledominated state jobs 
us district judge marilyn hall patel ruled that the california 
state employees association had failed to prove deliberate sex 
discrimination in state salaries 
she allowed csea to submit new arguments on a claim that state 
policies had the effect of illegally holding down the salaries of 
female state employees but that type of lawsuit without proof of 
intent has been made much more difficult to prove by a recent 
supreme court ruling 
csea sued in 1984 on behalf of 60000 or more past and present 
secretaries clerks nurses and other people in predominantly 
female state jobs the lawsuit contended those jobs had been 
deliberately underpaid for decades because the employees were 
women it sought hundreds of millions of dollars in back pay 
the union described the lawsuit as a sex discrimination case and 
resisted the label of comparable worth the doctrine that jobs 
of equal skill effort and responsibility deserve equal pay 
but the case has been generally described as a comparable worth 
lawsuit because it is based on pay disparities between different 
types of jobs rather than claiming that women were paid less than 
men in the same job 
the state denied discrimination and said any differences in pay 
levels reflected market rates lower pay for femaledominated jobs 
based on prevailing market levels was declared legal in 1985 by the 
9th us circuit court of appeals in an opinion by future supreme 
court justice anthony kennedy 
the crucial issue in wednesdays ruling was whether the state 
deliberately discriminated against women in the 1930s when state 
pay scales were revised csea contended that the effects of unequal 
pay levels for men and women in those revisions persist today 
but patel ruled that documents from a 1931 salary revision 
containing staff comments suggesting lower pay for some 
femaledominated jobs failed to prove deliberate and systematic 
discrimination and that the effects of any bias were largely 
eliminated in a further reclassification in 193738

the chairman of a federal panel of experts 
said wednesday that healthy women could get by with fewer visits to 
the doctor during pregnancy but women at high risk need more and 
better prenatal care 
dr mortimer g rosen panel chairman and head of obstetrics and 
gynecology at columbia college of physicians and surgeons in new 
york said healthy women whose fetuses are at no apparent risk now 
visit a doctor about 14 times during pregnancy 
eliminating or reducing some laboratory tests and procedures 
could cut five to seven visits from this schedule according to the 
recommendations of rosens panel whose report was issued by the 
public health service this week 
the report emphasizes the need for preconception counseling to 
warn women about the dangers of smoking drinking and drug use 
before they become pregnant and recommends that this counseling be 
covered by insurance plans 
it also recommends prenatal care be available to all women 
though it did not estimate what that would cost 
more than 25 percent of women receive poor prenatal care or none 
at all rosen said resulting in a high infant mortality rate for 
the united states 
for women at low risk for problems during pregnancy some of 
the visits to their doctor dont at least obviously contribute to 
the prevention of illness and the medical health of the mother 
rosen said 
for example he said healthy women dont need to be tested for 
protein in their urine at every prenatal visit and women who have 
had a pap test within the past year dont need another just because 
they become pregnant he also said blood pressure measurements 
arent necessary during every visit and more than one pelvic exam 
during pregnancy often is not needed 
ultimately the schedule of visits should be determined by the 
patient and her physician he said adding that some women might 
want more contact with their physician and that is their right 
rosen said he expected some physicians will dispute the panels 
recommendation for healthy women but he added let the people 
who feel this is wrong test it 
the panel did not estimate the savings that could result from 
less prenatal care for healthy women or the costs for additional 
care for women with fetuses at higher risk but it expected 
considerably more public funds would be needed since many women who 
need better prenatal care live near or below the poverty line 
however providing more care before a child is born will save 
costs in the long run rosen said 
prenatal care must be accessible to all women rosen said 
frontloading of prenatal care is going to be more expensive but 
by improving the outcome youll have fewer babies in intensive 
care and they will become more productive members of society

anticorruption drive in the 80000man force in february soon 
after taking over from a general who was forced out because of 
connections with drug traffickers 
el tiempo a bogota newspaper said in a story published 
wednesday that 2075 policemen had been dismissed or forced to 
resign for taking bribes from traffickers 
it said hundreds of others had quit because of low pay or other 
complaints starting policemen receive about 150 a month 
col alfredo salgado of the national police told the associated 
press the story was accurate 
the paper quoted gomez the police chief as saying infiltration 
by drug rings made the dismissals necessary el tiempo said the 
general noted the drug traffickers great capacity to bribe at 
all levels of national life 
in its appeal the state security council president barco 
five cabinet ministers and the attorney general urged colombians 
to resist pressure from the traffickers it cited bombings 
assassinations and other terrorist acts intended to turn people 
against the government 
the statement said traffickers were trying to create the 
impression that the government by refusing to negotiate with them 
was indirectly responsible for the violence 
although there has been no public demand for negotiations with 
the drug rings the subject has become a daily topic of discussion 
and many colombians support such talks 
barco and the others said they would not yield to threats and 
terrorism and repeated previous vows not to negotiate with the 
cartels 
reports said the government was preparing to extradite another 
drug figure 
caracol a national radio chain said authorities had completed 
the paperwork on ana rodriguez de tamayo wanted by a federal court 
in miami on charges of conspiracy and drug trafficking it said she 
could be extradited at any time 
army col fernando gonzalez said in an interview broadcast 
tuesday that bishop jaramillo was kidnapped monday in northeastern 
colombia by the national liberation army 
he said the guerrillas apparently wanted to use the bishop to 
carry a message to the government but the colonel did not say why 
he thought they killed the cleric

cancer patients who lose hope when standard 
treatments fail are fighting to force insurance companies to pay 
for drugs and procedures that the insurers call experimental and 
beyond their coverage 
the companies argue that they should not pay for unproven 
treatments ordered by researchers investigating new cures 
the issue has brought together doctors insurers lawyers and 
judges to determine who gets what kind of care for potentially 
fatal diseases 
the dilemma took on a human face wednesday when a federal judge 
here heard arguments on whether to force a health maintenance 
organization to pay for a 75000to125000 bone marrow 
transplant for a 22yearold truck driver with testicular cancer 
doctors said dean weeks of bernardsville needed the transplant 
immediately minutes before testimony was to begin memorial 
sloankettering cancer institute agreed to pay for the treatment 
out of charitable funds 
us district judge john bissell said he would hold a hearing on 
whether the hmo healthways systems inc of woodcliff lake should 
be required to reimburse sloankettering 
weeks was diagnosed a year ago and chemotherapy failed to stem 
the cancer 
hopefully ill get cured said weeks who sat next to his 
fiancee during the hearing i dont know what to say im just 
glad to have the treatment 
his lawyer kevin kovacs said forcing the hospital to pay for 
weeks could deny a future uninsured patient the chance for 
treatment 
healthways attorney jeffrey w pagano argued that forcing the 
hmo to fund experimental treatments could harm the quality of basic 
care for all its members kovacs said the hmo never defined 
experimental 
weeks needs an autologous bone marrow transplant in which his 
blood cellproducing bone marrow would be temporarily removed so 
high levels of chemotherapy can be applied that otherwise could 
kill the bone marrow 
the procedure is considered nonexperimental for certain kinds 
of cancers but not others including testicular cancer it is used 
when standard treatment fails 
in a parallel case in the same courthouse last spring us 
district judge dickinson r debevoise forced prudential insurance 
co and another firm to pay for the procedure for nicholae dosza 
60 of jefferson township 
some companies have also balked at paying for interleuken and 
lak or killer cell therapies which stimulate the bodys own 
response to cancer said john wingard an associate professor of 
oncology at johns hopkins university who treated dosza 
the problem is the same for aids treatment in which insurers 
lag behind federal approvals for new therapies said tom stoddard 
executive director of the lambda legal defense and education fund 
the insurance industrys cautious approach to new treatments is 
not based on monetary concerns argued susan pohli a prudential 
insurance co spokeswoman 
the issue isnt money the issue is safety she said 
insurers are justified in having a say in whether a treatment is 
effective or properly documented said jude payne a senior policy 
analyst for the health insurance association of america 
a key problem arises when doctors vary drug dosages or even 
uses beyond uses approved by insurance companies 
it really boils down to what is standard medical practice and 
what can be documented as effective said ms payne i think 
sometimes theres a little bit of tension there 
the insurers also argue that drugmakers seeking profits and 
researchers needing data should help pay for experimental 
treatments 
it may very well be that in lifethreatening situations where 
theres no alternative an exception should be made for insurers 
to foot the bill even if a therapy is still being investigated 
said ms payne

exiled panamanians said wednesday the failed 
attempt to topple gen manuel antonio noreiga shows his position is 
weakening and vowed the battle will continue 
all agreed that in the short run at least the victorious 
noriega will crack down even more on those who defy his authority 
from this point on there is going to be a lot of oppression 
against unallied military officers and against opposition people 
said luis endara cousin of opposition presidential candidate 
guillermo endara this is going to be an excuse for noriega to 
retaliate 
he said his cousin now reportedly in hiding somewhere in panama 
city will continue his highly publicized hunger strike and push 
for an economic boycott of the noriega regime by the people of 
panama 
exile groups here say they are receiving desperate messages from 
panama that other civilian political figures including raul ossa 
a vice president of the christian democratic party are being 
rounded up by security police 
endara was careful to draw a line between the authors of the 
coup attempt and the opposition he noted the insurgents never 
mentioned recognizing the opposition slate as the legitimate 
government of panama despite unanimity among international 
observers that guillermo endara won the last presidential election 
the coup does show that noriega is losing control of the 
military endara said 
over 300 military people are in prison in panama now endara 
said obviously the man is terrified because right now he 
doesnt know who is really with him 
the coup attempt was the second in 18 months noted aurelio 
barria former head of panamas civic crusade which organized last 
years domestic opposition to noriega he now leads an exile aid 
group here 
he hasnt gained support in this period he has been losing 
support barria said the military institution is 
selfdestructing 
he cautioned however that the officers who staged the latest 
coup attempt seemed more interested in internal military disputes 
than democracy 
it proves that isolated actions are not the solution barria 
said 
barria said he did not think the united states should have 
intervened directly but he said his contacts in panama were 
angered that broadcasts from us bases in panama failed to provide 
the populace with information on what was happening which could 
have sparked more public support 
endara went further saying a show of force by us troops could 
have tipped the balance in favor of the coup he said officers on 
the fence would have sided against noriega if they had seen 
evidence of military support by the united states 
they agreed however that noriegas days are numbered 
the fight for democracy is not over yet barria said and 
noriega has two strikes agaisnt him 
to the average panamanian political exile the coup failure was 
devastating 
my heart fell to my feet said rita conte who said her 
excited family had been planning to return home when they thought 
the coup was successful 
while most panamanians here strongly oppose noriega one of his 
miami attorneys raymond takiff said no one should count the 
general out 
takiff who represents the general in his fight against a miami 
drug indictment said he spoke early wednesday to the military 
rulers aide maj edgardo lopez who had noriega at his side 
takiff said noriega dismissed talk about dissension in the 
military and he also said the general contrary to reports 
tuesday was never hurt or in the custody of the dissidents

perthandover new brunswick ap a us air force tanker jet 
exploded in the air wednesday over canada killing at least three 
of four crew members authorities said 
a panel of military and civilian officials was being assembled 
in an attempt to determine what caused the fourengine jet to blow 
up and crash setting fire to woods near this border town air 
force officials said 
the kc135a tanker was returning from a refueling mission to 
loring air force base in limestone maine less than 20 miles from 
the crash site 
three bodies have been recovered but not the fourth said 
capt kellie rebscher a spokeswoman at loring 
rebscher confirmed that the plane exploded in the air and that 
it was not equipped with a black box that could have recorded 
crew members final words she said the crew was in radio contact 
with the loring control tower a few minutes before the explosion 
and they never indicated anything was wrong 
efforts to locate the missing man continued many hours after the 
predawn explosion which witnesses said looked like fireworks and 
felt like an earthquake people living nearby said they heard saw a 
flash of light then smelled burning rubber and diesel fumes 
the noise my whole house shook windows and everything 
said anita davenport a nearby resident 
chunks of twisted metal and other crash debris were scattered 
over a wide area said those who reached the scene before the air 
force seal it off the tail of the jet was fairly intact coming to 
rest about a halfmile from the fuselage which landed in a ravine 
cold winds dusted the wreckage with a light snow 
the plane was returning from a refueling mission when it went 
down at around 6 am in a heavily wooded valley north of this 
community of about 1900 people just across the border from fort 
fairfield maine the air force said 
the jet which rebscher said was 25 years old is a boeing 707 
reconfigured as a tanker for refueling fighters and bombers based 
at loring an aircraft needing fuel moves in behind the tanker 
plane and nuzzles a fuelreceiving arm into a long boom protruding 
from a kc135 
rebscher said she was uncertain whether the loring plane had 
unloaded its refueling tanks prior to the explosion she also said 
she did not know the altitude at which the explosion occurred 
the victims identities were being withheld pending notification 
of relatives 
wednesdays explosion was the third crash involving a kc135 
this year 
on sept 20 an alaska national guard kc135 exploded and burned 
while taxiing to park at eielson air force base killing two 
people on jan 31 all 19 people aboard a kc135 died when it 
crashed on takeoff from dyess air force base in texas a kc135 
crash in 1988 killed six crewmen at wurtsmith air force base in 
michigan 
ray gamblin who owns the woods where the debris came down said 
the plane was coming towards our place when it exploded 
when you think it could have been one of the planes that carry 
nuclear bombs well thats pretty scary gamblin said if it 
had gone down 10 seconds later it wouldve been right in our 
house

engineers replaced a faulty rocket 
computer wednesday and nasa officially set oct 12 for the launch 
of space shuttle atlantis with a nuclearpowered planetary probe 
shuttle managers had expected to select that date on tuesday but 
delayed the decision because of a problem in one of two computers 
on a rocket intended to boost the galileo spacecraft toward jupiter 
after it is released in orbit by atlantis astronauts 
the bad computer was replaced by a spare and nasa reported 
initial tests showed it was working fine and that there was no need 
to delay the launch oct 12 had been the unofficial date for 
several months 
liftoff was set for 129 pm 
officials said the two computers were supposed to talk the 
same language but they did not because one had a software problem 
because galileo will be powered by two generators fueled by 
radioactive plutonium238 dioxide three antinuclear groups last 
week sued in us district court in washington dc in an attempt 
to stop the launch 
the organizations filed briefs with the court wednesday the 
national aeronautics and space administration is scheduled to file 
its reply on friday judge oliver gasch has set an oct 10 hearing 
the opponents contend that a launch accident could spread 
poisonous plutonium over heavily populated eastcentral florida 
nasa says that in tests the plutonium containers have been blown 
up shot at and burned to determine how they would survive 
accidents they have withstood pressures far greater than those 
generated in the 1986 explosion of challenger the agency said 
even if there were a release nasa said it would have no 
appreciable adverse health effects on the population 
if they lose the lawsuit the antinuclear activists said they 
will try to physically halt the liftoff by trying to infiltrate the 
kennedy space center on launch day

two months after his first choice was rejected 
by lawmakers attorney general dick thornburgh is still looking for 
someone to be the justice departments civil rights chief a 
spokesman said wednesday 
we dont have a short list of candidates said david runkel 
press secretary for the attorney general its a difficult 
position to fill 
the delay in finding a candidate raises the possibility that 
president bush would not have a new nominee for the position before 
congress adjourns later this fall 
the last guy who was nominated for that position took a few 
knocks there are not a lot of people volunteering runkel said 
of the senate judiciary committees refusal to approve william 
lucas to be assistant attorney general for civil rights 
about a halfdozen people have been interviewed for the job 
since the panel voted aug 1 to kill the nomination on a pair of 
77 votes runkel said 
after those votes thornburgh said lucas was a victim of raw 
politics and accused the senate judiciary committee of 
establishing a litmus test that anyone nominated for the job 
must oppose recent supreme court decisions on job discrimination 
but critics contended that lucas was professionally unqualified 
for the job having never tried a court case and lacking lengthy 
experience as a lawyer 
during his confirmation hearing in july lucas stumbled several 
times when discussing civil rights cases confessing at one point 
that he was new to the law 
several democratic senators also expressed dismay that lucas 
would not criticize the high court rulings which civil rights 
lawyers say will make it harder to win discrimination cases 
lucas stuck close to the bush administrations policy saying he 
would monitor the impact on those decisions to determine if 
legislation were needed to overturn them 
justice department aides argued that lucas was a victim of 
timing as much as anything because he was forced to defend supreme 
court decisions that were handed down shortly before his 
confirmation hearing 
they argued it was absurd to expect bush to nominate someone who 
didnt agree with his civil rights policies 
thornburgh quickly appointed lucas to head the justice 
departments office of liaison services a post that did not 
require senate confirmation lucas duties include dealing with the 
very same civil rights groups that opposed his confirmation 
on wednesday runkel argued that the rough treatment lucas 
received during his confirmation hearing has hampered efforts to 
recruit a new nominee 
its not an easy position to fill and part of the reason was 
the way bill lucas was treated runkel said 
i couldnt accept the notion that lucas demise in the 
committee makes it difficult to fill the job said washington 
civil rights attorney william taylor who lobbied against the 
nomination 
there are hundreds of lawyers with civil rights experience in 
the country who would not have any difficulty passing muster with 
the committee taylor said 
the department which conducts interviews and makes 
recommendations to the white house has not asked the fbi to 
conduct background checks on anyone who has been interviewed 
runkel said 
the fbi conducts such background checks which routinely take 
several weeks before a nomination is approved by the white house 
once the nomination is made the senate judiciary committees 
own investigation can delay a vote by the panel and the full senate 
for several weeks perhaps months 
the spokesman declined to say whether the difficulty in finding 
a candidate means that bush wouldnt have a nominee ready for 
senate consideration before congress adjourns this fall 
the civil rights division which initiates criminal and civil 
cases to enforce antidiscrimination laws is being run by acting 
assistant attorney general james turner who took over after the 
departure of william bradford reynolds who headed the division 
during the reagan administration

president bush renewed on wednesday his push 
for a lower capital gains tax saying it is not a tax cut for a 
few but a way to help millions of americans find jobs 
bush made the pitch at a small business administration ceremony 
honoring minority entrepreneurs 
he urged the senate to follow the lead of the house and cut 
the capital gains tax now 
it is not a tax cut for a few but a tax cut for all a way 
to channel investment back into new growth and new jobs said the 
president 
the major beneficiaries will not be the rich but people 
looking for their first job or perhaps their second job said 
bush it is a joboriented tax cut 
the house last week voted to cut the capital gains tax now 28 
percent to 33 percent to 196 percent for two years and then 
provide inflation indexing for new assets subject to the levy 
congressional tax experts have said 80 percent of the benefits 
would go to people with incomes over 100000 a year it would 
boost federal revenues in the next three years by 9 billion but 
lose 21 billion over 10 years according to the joint committee on 
taxation 
but bush disputes those estimates arguing that by freeing money 
for investments a lower capital gains tax would spur economic 
growth and generate more tax revenues 
bush said the measure will raise employment and raise millions 
of our fellow americans to a new threshold of opportunity 
the business of america is not businss the true business is 
opportunity he told 150 people at the gathering in the old 
executive office building no government program can match the 
opportunity created for all americans by those special people that 
we call entrepreneurs 
bush drew loud applause by promising to restore and 
reinvigorate the vision behind the office of minority business 
enterprise 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher and sba administrator susan 
engeleiter joined bush in presenting awards to 
ronald thompson head of general railroad equipment and 
services inc of east st louis mo as minority entrepreneur of 
the year his company has grouwn fivefold in seven years and now 
employs 300 people 
teresa mcbride of albuquerque nm as sba minority small 
business person of the year her retail consumer electronics 
business mcbride micro source has sales of 86 million a year 
roy and rudolph terry of terry manufacturing of roanoke ala

the soviet union has bought 100000 metric 
tons of soybean meal and an additional 200000 tons of corn for 
delivery in 198990 under a longterm supply agreement the 
agriculture department said wednesday

corn announced tuesday the seventh year of the longterm agreement 
between the two countries began oct 1

corn would be about 788 million bushels 
the new sales were made by unidentified private exporting 
companies which are required to report large sales to the 
department no selling prices or further details were released 
corn prices have been averaging about 222 per bushel at the 
farm according to usdas fiveday average meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of around 175 million 
soybean meal has been selling at wholesale in illinois at an

president bush on wednesday urged zaires 
president mobutu sese seko to settle his differences with angolan 
rebel leader jonas savimbi amid reports that mobutu has disrupted 
the flow of us arms to savimbis guerrillas 
mobutu was summoned to the white house from new york to discuss 
the deterioration in his relations with savimbi and the faltering 
june ceasefire which zaire mediated between the rebels and 
angolas sovietbacked government who have been fighting for 14 
years 
mobutu savimbi and angolas foreign minister pedro van dunem 
were all in washington on wednesday but none of them met 
mobutu returned to new york where he addressed the un general 
assembly on wednesday afternoon during mobutus speech at the 
united nations un guards hustled six people out of the visitors 
gallery after they shouted murderer at him 
savimbi who leads the union for the total independence of 
angola unita is to meet with bush on thursday 
during bushs 30minute meeting with mobutu the president 
reiterated the strong us support for unita and our appreciation 
of president mobutus efforts to try to help bring about national 
reconciliation in angola said white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater 
the president urged president mobutu to work out any 
differences which he might have with unita so that the goal of 
national reconciliation can be met he said bush will also 
urge him savimbi to work with mobutu and all the parties 
involved 
the problem is that unita and the angolan government have 
differing views of what reconciliation means the sides have 
refused to sit in the same room instead they have used mobutu 
other african leaders and the united states as gobetweens 
van dunem who came to washington for one day wednesday to 
counter savimbis visit told reporters his government wants 
savimbi to step down and to integrate his forces into the angolan 
armed forces once that happens and the civil war ends multiparty 
elections can be discussed he said 
a multiparty system now is unthinkable he said 
van dunem contended that savimbi agreed to go into temporary 
exile during a closeddoor meeting in june with angolan president 
eduardo dos santos held in gbadolite zaire the same place where 
they openly agreed to a ceasefire 
however savimbi denied the claim during a news conference 
saying if there was a secret agreement it was a secret to me 
too 
he said the first step for angola must be free elections that 
would give unita a role in running the country 
van dunem accused savimbi of reneging on the gbadolite 
agreements saying savimbi had come to the united states to ask for 
more weapons to augment an estimated 40 million in arms he already 
gets annually 
he said mobutu the main channel for american arms supplies to 
savimbi told the angolan government he had stopped shipping us 
weapons to unita before the june accords 
on tuesday sen jesse helms rnc complained at a hearing of 
the senate foreign relations committee that mobutu had cut the flow 
of us arms to savimbis forces but neither fitzwater nor savimbi 
would discuss the matter mobutu did not talk to the news media 
during his brief visit to washington 
during his previous visit to washington in june mobutu told 
administration officials that us aid to unita and soviet aid to 
the angolan government should both stop to give the gbadolite 
agreements a chance to work 
but the truce agreement collapsed soon after it was signed and 
mobutu has been siding with the angolan government which demanded 
that savimbi step down 
mobutu has promised to ask savimbi to sign a commitment of 
temporary exile before an upcoming summit of african leaders in 
gabon van dunem said 
he urged the bush administration to support the gbadolite 
accords as interpreted by angola mobutu and other african leaders 
that savimbi go into exile saying he planned to press his case 
with secretary of state james baker iii baker has agreed to meet 
with van dunem although the united states and angola have no 
diplomatic relations 
van dunem also accused the administration of reneging on a 
promise by former secretary of state george shultz that the united 
states would establish diplomatic links with the angolan government 
once angola agreed to the withdrawal of the 50000 cuban troops 
stationed there 
the cuban pullout was agreed to in a ussponsored agreement 
signed last december and about half have left thus far 
the state department has denied such a promise was made saying 
the united states would withhold official recognition of angola 
until national reconciliation with unita is achieved

six members of miamis street narcotics unit were 
indicted wednesday on charges they allegedly chased down a drug 
dealer and beat him to death after an anonymous tip indicated he 
had a murder contract on one of them 
the federal indictment charged the officers with civil rights 
violations resulting in the dec 16 death of leonardo mercado two 
of the officers also were accused of beating mercado about six 
weeks before the fatal attack and all six were charged with 
attacking mercados stepson jose soto on the night of the killing 
state attorney janet reno would not respond when asked if her 
department was pursuing state charges 
a federal magistrate ordered the six officers who were relieved 
of duty after mercados death to post 200000 personal surety 
bond and appear for arraignment oct 16 
the six entered court manacled to each other amid applause from 
relatives and friends outside if convicted each faces life 
imprisonment and a 750000 fine 
its a sad day when a federal grand jury must indict six 
police officers for intentional use of unreasonable force said 
us attorney dexter lehtinen 
this case reminds us that everyone president police 
officers the average citizen is subject to the law and will be 
prosecuted for deliberate violations of the law he said 
miami police cooperated with the federal investigation and 
expected the indictment 
were saddened by the experience but we must go out and

the community said police chief perry anderson 
the indictment alleges that about six weeks before the fatal 
attack officers pablo camacho and andy watson beat mercado 35 at 
a game room near his apartment it then alleges that all six 
officers were on their way to a drug sting on dec 16 when they 
allegedly detoured to mercados apartment and attacked him and his 
stepson mercado died hours later 
reports had been circulating around the department for a few 
days that an anonymous tip indicated mercado had targeted camacho 
for murder 
all six officers were charged with conspiracy to threaten and 
intimidate mercado by use of unreasonable force under color of law 
and civil rights violations in the death of mercado and the attack 
on soto camacho and watson were charged with a civil rights 
violation in the november beating of mercado 
the officers charged and their experience with the department 
are camacho 42 13 years charlie haynes 30 10 years ronald 
sinclair 46 seven years thomas trujillo 31 nine years 
nathaniel veal jr 31 eight years and watson 32 nine years

a bridge that is the only land link 
between the mainland and homes on two barrier islands on wednesday 
was hoisted out of the intracoastal waterway where it was dumped 
by hurricane hugo 
officials of hardhit charleston put out the word that they want 
tourists to start coming back to the historic city 
officials hoped to open the ben sawyer bridge to traffic by 
thursday giving residents of the isle of palms and sullivans 
island land access to their homes for the first time since the 
killer storm struck on sept 21 
hugos 135mph wind wrenched the 500000ton swing bridge 
leaving it tipped at a 45degree angle leaning on its center 
support pier with one end submerged in the water 
the bridge was lifted out of the water by a crane mounted on a 
barge 
highway officials said they would inspect the bridge before 
declaring it safe for traffic since the storm the only access to 
the islands has been by boat or helicopter 
dozens of spectators watched the bridge operation in small boats 
stopped in the waterway 
others watched from the shoreline at the tolers cover marina 
and condominium complex where the storm ripped the roofs off some 
units and tossed boats around the parking lot 
among them was melvin anderegg mayor of sullivans island 
residents were again living on the island and power and water 
has been restored although the water has not yet been approved for 
drinking he said 
the people want to get back to their homes and get started 
digging out anderegg said everywhere you look over there are 
people cleaning up and moving things 
the mayor estimated that between 100 and 150 of the 
approximately 850 houses on the island are not habitable many of 
them are rental and vacation homes 
the south carolina electric amp gas co said about twothirds of 
the utilitys 158000 customers in the metropolitan charleston area 
had power restored by late tuesday power was restored by wednesday 
to almost all customers in other areas of the state power company 
officials said 
hurricane hugo slammed into the south carolina coast sept 21 
killing at least 18 and damaging and destroying homes businesses 
schools and municipal buildings as far inland as sumter and north 
to north carolina in all 29 people were killed on the us 
mainland 
damage in south carolina has been estimated at 3 billion or 
more 
the federal emergency management agency opened two additional 
disaster assistance centers wednesday in south carolina making a 
total of 16 centers where people can apply for emergency grants and 
loans in addition it is now operating a telephone hotline and 
applications may be submitted over the phone said paul hall 
femas coordinating officer for the hurricane recovery 
the red cross announced wednesday that only seven storm 
evacuation shelters housing 454 people remain open around the 
state down from 10 shelters tuesday since the storm approached 
453 shelters have housed 87230 people 
even while the cleanup continued officials urged visitors to 
return to historic charleston 
we plan to go to every city in america that sent aid to 
charleston and go on their media and thank them and tell them 
charleston is open for business said tom blazer chairman of the 
charleston trident chamber of commerce 
ninety percent of the areas hotels and restaurants should be 
open by midoctober 
the tourism industry is worth 49 billion to the local economy 
blazer said 
mayor joseph p riley jr also urged visitors to return 
weve bounced back from hurricane hugo and visitors should not 
cancel their plans to come to charleston but should come right 
ahead the mayor said a 9 pm to 5 am curfew should be lifted 
soon 
meanwhile a coalition of charleston area groups announced plans 
to begin replacing millions of acres of trees devastated by hugo 
the effort dubbed lowcountry releaf will collect funds to buy 
seedlings and distribute trees between thanksgiving and arbor day

the principal tasks of the nearly 13000 us 
military forces in panama are to protect both the panama canal and 
the estimated 40000 american civilians living in that country 
these forces are precluded from involvement in panamanian 
internal affairs but panamanian officials have said us troops 
frequently have been used in maneuvers designed to intimidate the 
government 
under the panama canal treaties us forces are allowed to 
patrol only their own bases and areas under joint uspanamanian 
jurisdiction 
there were about 10800 us military personnel in panama early 
this year but president bush augmented that number by 2000 after a 
postelection outbreak of violence in panama 
the us southern command responsible for all us military 
activities in central and south america is headquartered at quarry

cypriot president george vassiliou conferred 
with president bush on wednesday and said he is willing to 
demilitarize cyprus if turkey withdraws its troops from the island 
vassiliou met in the oval office with bush secretary of state 
james a baker iii national security adviser brent scowcroft and 
bushs special cyprus negotiator nelson ledsky 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said afterwards 
that bush reaffirmed us support for un efforts to negotiate a 
solution to the cyprus problem bush expressed his hope that the 
talks will be resumed at the earliest possible date fitzwater 
said 
vassiliou speaking with reporters on the white house driveway 
called it an extremely good meeting im extremely 
satisfied 
he said bush made it quite clear that he does not consider 
the status quo as a solution 
turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 and in 1983 turkish cypriots 
declared a breakaway republic in their third of the eastern 
mediterranean island turkey still has 30000 troops on the island 
where un peacekeeping forces help keep the peace between the 
majority greek cypriots and the turkish minority 
vassiliou said his government has been building up its military 
for defensive purposes but he insisted its army of 10000 to 
12000 conscripts is no match for the turkish forces 
he repeated a challenge first delivered earlier in the day in a 
speech to the un general assembly in new york 
i challenge the turkish government if theyre really worried 
about our building up our defenses lets demilitarize we are 
ready to do that any moment he said 
lets start they withdraw their armies we dismantle our army 
and also give away all our guns and lets have cyprus 
demilitarized under any kind of guarantees 
vassiliou called upon leaders of turkey and the turkish cypriots 
to stop making difficulties and sit down and talk 
i would like to give this message to the turkish people its 
an anachronism to have the cyprus issue open it helps nobody it 
causes pain to all of us and it costs a lot of money that we could 
use much better for the benefit of our people 
cyprus with its problems would be a good friend of turkey 
would be a place where turkish cypriots and greek cypriots would 
feel happy and will contriute significantly to peace in the 
region he said 
he said the impoverished turkish cypriot community had the most 
to gain from a solution 
vassiliou gave bush a gift of an ancient vase from cyprus 
dating to 600 bc 
six hundred bc exclaimed bush displaying the heirloom 
for cameras 
six hundred bc yes said vassiliou joking its maybe 
580 or 620 
it looks like about 590 bc cracked bush

a coalition of citizens groups sought a court 
order wednesday to delay the scheduled oct 12 launch of a 
nuclearpowered probe from the space shuttle 
the danger of plutonium contamination from a shuttle disaster is 
far greater than the government has admitted the florida coalition 
for peace and justice and two other organizations said in us 
district court 
the groups which filed suit sept 28 made formal requests for 
a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to stop 
the launch of the shuttle atlantis which is to carry the galileo 
probe into space 
in a 37page court brief the groups said a number of scientists 
are counseling against making the launch 
richard cuddihy a leading expert on radiation poisoning wrote 
the white house last month saying the launch puts large numbers of 
people at risk the court papers said 
cuddihy also is a member of the interagency nuclear safety 
review panel which is composed of representatives of nasa the 
department of energy and the defense department 
cuddihy estimated the cost in human lives and cleanup of a 
galileo explosion would be many times higher than that admitted by 
the national aeronautics and space administration 
he recommended that these types of missions be launched on 
unmanned rockets from remote locations 
the court filing also said that 
robert weatherwax a leading authority on the dangers of the 
space shuttle has called the galileo launch irresponsible he 
estimates the possibilities of an accident and a deadly plutonium 
release from galileo are 1in350 
nasa says the highest probability of launch area release of 
plutonium due to a shuttle accident is less than 1in2500 
horst poehler a longtime consultant for nasa contractors has 
challenged the risk assessments of nasa poehler said nasa has not 
made public for comment the assumptions and details of the agencys 
calculations for nuclear release or individual per person doses of 
radiation for various types of accidents 
once in orbit galileo is to rocket itself on a roundabout 
voyage to jupiter powering the craft are two radioisotope 
thermoelectric generators each of the rtgs are energized by 247 
pounds of plutonium238 
the suit said the galileo project will condemn thousands of 
eastern florida residents to a wholly unnecessary and virtual 
certainty of contracting cancer if a shuttle launch accident 
similar to the one that destroyed challenger in 1986 caused the 
plutonium to be vaporized and spread over the area 
joining the filing of the suit were the foundation on economic 
trends and the christic institute

eighteen east germans who occupied the us 
embassy in an effort to flee to the west left the compound late 
wednesday with assurances their government will look favorably on 
their emigration requests diplomats said 
earlier in the day east german police cordoned off the embassy 
in east berlin and scuffled with about 50 other refugees also 
hoping to gain sanctuary there 
elsewhere thousands of other east germans lined railroad tracks 
with packed bags and children in tow hoping to jump aboard trains 
carrying their countrymen to the west from prague czechoslovakia 
witnesses said the trains were to pass through east germany on 
their way to hof west germany 
east germany reluctantly agreed to allow the exodus the second 
in the last four days after thousands of its citizens flooded 
embassies in prague and warsaw poland 
wednesdays scuffle in east berlin came a day after the 18 east 
germans moved into the embassy and refused to leave until they were 
given permission to emigrate from their communist homeland 
according to a statement from the us embassy those 18 agreed 
to leave the mission wednesday night and went home east german 
officials have promised to examine with goodwill their 
emigration applications the statement said 
western diplomats in east berlin said they assume the group will 
soon be permitted to leave for west germany though it was not 
clear if east german authorities explicitly made such a promise 
after agreeing to the latest rail exodus the hardline east 
berlin government on tuesday closed its border with czechoslovakia 
that is the only country where east germans could freely travel 
without government permission 
that closure and the sanctioned exodus from prague has triggered 
a flood of other east germans desperately trying to take part in 
the mass transfer 
witnesses said about 100 east german police scuffled with about 
50 wouldbe emigres in front of the us embassy preventing their 
entry there were no reports of injuries

a blood bank plans to start reporting the 
names of aids carriers to health authorities who in turn will try 
to trace the patients sexual contacts officials said 
we dont want people with aids or people at high risk for aids 
donating blood said ken wiebeck spokesman for the southwest 
florida blood bank its not right its not safe the safety of 
the public is of primary importance 
also the blood bank wants to discourage people from using 
donations as a way to get a free confidential aids test 
one of our fears is that people may be donating blood to get a 
confidential test for aids said dr paul schmidt director of 
the blood bank and a recent past president of the american 
association of blood banks 
a spokesman for aids patients advised caution in reporting names 
passing along names would scare people said chuck kuehn 
executive director of the tampa aids network they would have 
achieved their purpose but i dont agree with their tactics 
the tampa blood bank is considered among the most aggressive in 
the country in trying to prevent aids carriers from donating blood 
in march 1988 the bank became one of two in the united states to 
start interviewing donors to identify highrisk applicants a san 
bernardino calif blood bank was the other 
donors will be told of the policy and asked to sign a form 
acknowledging they were so advised if tests show young donors 17 
or 18 carry the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome the blood bank will notify 
their parents or guardian 
dr don kwalick director of the hillsborough county health 
department said his employees intend to follow the same procedures 
they use in tracing contacts of patients with other sexually 
transmitted diseases names from the blood bank would be used as 
one source of information in tracing contacts 
he said recently passed laws let the department include aids 
patients in the tracing but that state health and rehabilitative 
services officials have to give their permission 
the health department offers anonymous and confidential aids 
testing 
the blood bank has been identifying between one and two donors 
that test positive for the aids virus for every 10000 units of 
blood donated that is about what would be expected nationally 
wiebeck said 
in the interview process potential donors are asked a series of 
questions instead of simply being asked to complete a form saying 
they do not fall into highrisk categories 
the tampa data showed 62 donors out of the approximately 36000 
seen since the questioning began were deferred because they 
gave a positive response to a question 
the questions include 
have you had sexual contact with prostitutes in the past six 
months 
have you had clinical or laboratory evidence of aids infection 
or had sexual contact with someone who has 
have you engaged in male homosexual activity or had sexual 
contact with someone who had 
two additional questions ask about intravenous drug use and 
whether the donor has immigrated from haiti or west or central 
africa since 1977 or had sexual contact with an immigrant from 
those regions

a state superintendent took control of 
jersey citys faltering public schools wednesday completing a 
fiveyear legal struggle that ended in the nations largest state 
takeover of an urban school district 
jersey city students have been subjected to educational child 
abuse said gov thomas h kean now the community can put 
politics and patronage aside and get on with the business of 
learning 
the state had cited political intrusion in hiring practices 
poor test scores failure to provide a safe clean environment for 
students violations of bidding laws failure to provide for 
handicapped children and unauthorized use of state funds as some of 
the reasons for the takeover 
on wednesday the state board of education in jamesburg gave 
final approval to the takeover and formally appointed elena j 
scambio to a threeyear term as superintendent of the school 
district 
ms scambios first act was to abolish the jobs of seven top 
administrators in the district including that of school 
superintendent franklin williams the state boards action also 
officially disbanded the jersey city board of education 
a new board is expected to be appointed by state education 
commissioner saul cooperman by december 
ms scambio a former essex county school superintendent who has 
been preparing for the transition since august promised to 
unravel the quagmire that exists in jersey city and make the 
city a national model of urban education 
under new jerseys takeover law the state has five years to 
make improvements national education groups say they will closely 
monitor the progress of the takeover 
the move gives the state extraordinary powers in jersey city 
the states second largest district with 28000 students 
ms scambio said other immediate changes may include trimming 
from 100 to 150 staff positions streamlined management physical 
improvements to schools and better community relations 
the jersey city school system has a staff of 3322 and a budget 
for the current year of about 180 million enrollment is 44 
percent black 34 percent hispanic and 13 percent white 
the boards decision was expected and ends a bitter legal battle 
by the state to take over the schools a process strongly pushed by 
kean who has billed himself as the education governor 
state board vice president robert a woodruff reading a 
resolution said the districts problems were deeprooted and 
endemic the jersey city board of education totally failed to meet 
its obligations 
this summer administrative law judge kenneth springer agreed 
with the argument of state officials in his decision to grant the 
state power to take over the district 
springer noted that some textbooks used in jersey city 
classrooms are more than 30 years old 
jersey city officials bitterly fought the takeover effort 
saying the problems were caused by a prior administration and that 
the state trumped up its case against the district 
williams who was relieved as school superintendent but can 
still teach in the district released a statement wednesday 
criticizing the takeover effort 
in a society that offers little enough to bolster the 
selfconfidence of urban children the campaign to take over the 
jersey city schools has only further lowered the selfimage of our 
students williams said 
williams said test scores have climbed in recent years and one 
of the districts high schools was one of only five in the state 
with a 100 percent passing rate on the high school proficiency test 
local officials had at first sought to rally public opinion 
against the intervention but found little political support former 
mayor anthony cuccio who opposed the takeover lost his seat in 
may to gerald mccann who said he would not oppose the move 
it should have happened much sooner i think said samir 
skular 31 a 31yearold city resident with two daughters in the 
public schools it was just politicians trying to protect their 
jobs and not thinking about kids 
jean mcdonald a researcher for the national governors 
association said kentucky south carolina texas and new mexico 
have laws allowing state takeovers of failing school districts 
in kentucky the state school board has taken limited control of 
three county districts under an academic bankruptcy law enacted 
by the general assembly in 1988

heckled by iran lebanese legislators 
met on wednesday and debated scrapping a 46yearold pact that 
divides government jobs along sectarian lines 
they agreed earlier to revamp parliament with an equal number of 
moslems and christians in an effort to end the 14yearold civil 
war 
any agreement however must win the support of powerful 
warlords who have controlled much of lebanon since fighting began 
in 1975 moslem militia leaders nabih berri and walid jumblatt 
reportedly gave negative assessments of the taif efforts on 
wednesday 
militia leaders have been kept away from the meeting 
the conflict is a battleground for conflicting arab interests as 
well as for lebanese factions the war has killed at least 150000 
people and turned much of the capital beirut into rubble 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani warned the legislators 
wednesday not to surrender to domination by maronite catholics 
if they give in they have done a great treason to the 
lebanese people and should be seriously confronted the islamic 
republic news agency quoted rafsanjani as saying 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati earlier wednesday 
rejected decisions taken by the legislators on grounds they failed 
to hand over the bulk of political power to moslems 
in beirut two foreign passenger jets an aeroflot flight from 
moscow and a french airliner landed at the airport wednesday the 
first since the airport reopened nearly two weeks ago after a 
ceasefire that ended six months of shelling duels between moslem 
and christian militias 
thirtythree christian and 30 moslem legislators representing 
all but 10 of the bodys surviving 73 members met for a fifth day 
to discuss reforms aimed at ending the war 
they agreed tuesday to expand the 99seat parliament and to 
ensure an equal distribution between christians and moslems 
the last official census conducted in 1932 showed christians 
made up a majority of the population but later estimates say 
moslems make up 55 percent of lebanons 4 million people 
on wednesday the deputies talked of using a merit system to 
fill government jobs 
sources at the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said all deputies opposed continuing the present sectarian system 
but differed on how and when to change it 
some christian speakers made reform conditional on a withdrawal 
of syrian forces from lebanon the sources said 
saudi foreign minister prince saud alfaisal and other mediators 
met christian deputies apparently to try to persuade them to drop 
this condition 
deputies also discussed possible expansion of the premiers 
powers at the expense of the president 
under an unwritten 1943 national covenant power was shared by a 
maronite catholic president a sunni moslem premier and a shiite 
moslem parliament speaker with top government army and public 
administration posts going to the maronites 
one parliament member who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
abolishing political factionalism is an issue too explosive for 
the parliamentarians to handle without the prior consent of the 
warlords who control the lebanese arena 
irans staterun news agency irna said rafsanjanis statement 
came after he met in tehran with four lebanese moslem leaders 
berri leader of the shiite amal movement jumblatt the druse 
chieftain sheik subhi tufaili a leader of the shiite hezbollah 
or party of god and sheik saeed shaaban head of a syrian and 
libyanbacked sunni fundamentalist faction 
velayati told a news conference in tehran we can place no hope 
in the taif meeting iranian tv reported 
since the majority of the lebanese people are moslems it is 
natural that the principal rule in lebanon must be in the hands of 
moslems he said 
if any decision is made at taif or elsewhere that contradicts 
this basic principle it will not be accepted by the moslem and 
nationalist forces and it will be rejected by iran and syria 
velayati said 
the broadcast and irna dispatch were monitored in cyprus 
jumblatt and berri say syrian troops are needed to guarantee a 
settlement 
iranian tv said amal issued a statement saying the taif meeting 
will not reach a just solution to lebanons crisis 
in beirut the christianrun voice of lebanon quoted jumblatt as 
saying a ceasefire that began late last month was just an 
intermission in the war 
iran is a major backer of shiites in lebanon who are estimated 
to be the largest sect there 
supporters of christian leader gen michel aoun a maronite 
demand a timetable for a pullout of syrias 40000 troops from 
lebanon before considering political reforms 
if agreement is reached on reforms the lebanese parliament 
would convene in beirut to ratify them formally with a tentative 
date set at oct 21

victim but it was not babbington 
the victim was an entirely innocent man who was on his way to 
work the constabulary said in a statement late wednesday 
the fact that the shooting appears to have been carried out

predominantly catholic party in the province 
press association britains domestic news agency said the man 
identified by the ira was taken into protective custody a

group claimed responsibility for another shooting wednesday in 
north belfast the victim who suffered shoulder and leg injuries 
was related to a prominent member of sinn fein the iras legal 
political wing police said 
the ira is fighting to end british rule in northern ireland and 
unite the 60 percent protestant province with the 95 percent 
catholic irish republic 
twenty years of violence have claimed 2758 lives in northern

a woman who fatally stabbed her two young 
daughters then forced her 8yearold son to kill her with the same 
knife had threatened last month to poison all four of her children 
a social services lawyer said wednesday 
the allegation came to light in a juvenile court custody hearing 
the day after marie king killed her 3 and 4yearold daughters 
with a 10inch kitchen knife and ordered her son to stab her 
investigators said 
the womans husband christopher king called the state 
department of health and rehabilitative services last month saying 
she had threatened to poison all four children said pablo perez a 
department lawyer 
mrs king 32 denied the threat when confronted by social 
workers perez said 
christopher king then refused state services saying he needed 
his wife at home to take care of the children while he worked said 
ruben betancourt a spokesman for the department 
the departments investigation remained open and betancourt 
said agency procedures were followed 
we started an investigation at the fathers request on the 
accusation that the mother was threatening the children we went 
and talked to the mother talked to the father talked to the 
children who were happy wellfed betancourt said 
neighbors said mrs king rarely left the twobedroom house since 
the family moved in a few months ago her husband attended two 
neighborhood crime watch meetings and the children frequently were 
seen playing outside 
judge seymour gelber said the agencys handling of the matter 
was appropriate it appears hrs did what it should have done 
he said so this was not a case where hrs failed to follow up 
the state agency went to court wednesday for custody of the 
8yearold and his 6yearold brother after the father refused to 
allow medical and psychological evaluations of the boys perez said

a jury wednesday began deliberating the 
fraud and conspiracy charges against ptl founder jim bakker and 
must decide if he is the worldclass con man prosecutors 
contend or the victim of circumstance his lawyers say 
bakker is accused of diverting more than 37 million in ptl 
money to live in high style buying rollsroyces lavish homes raw 
diamonds an airconditioned doghouse and furnishings ranging from 
mirrored walls and goldplated swan bathroom fixtures to motorized 
bedroom drapes and gigantic walkin closets 
i feel fine bakker said as he and his wife tammy faye 
left the federal courthouse asked if he was worried about the 
outcome bakker responded no im trusting god 
last night we had a great dinner together he said we 
slept like babies mrs bakker added 
the jury returned to the courtroom several times after getting 
the case wednesday morning one of the jurors requests was for 
evidence relating to wire fraud charges 
the jury also asked us district court judge robert potter for 
clarification of a charge two boxes of government exhibits and an 
explanation of federal statutes relating to mail and wire fraud and 
conspiracy 
the jury recessed its deliberations at 6 pm 
bakker 49 is charged in us district court with 15 counts of 
wire fraud eight counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy 
to commit wire and mail fraud 
prosecutors contend that bakker solicited money for lifetime 
partnerships at his heritage usa retreat near fort mill sc 
but used the the money for projects other than the lodging he 
promised lifetime partners typically paid 1000 for the promise 
of three nights and four days annually at the theme park bakker 
raised 158 million through partnership sales 
he resigned from the ministry in 1987 amid a sex and money 
scandal 
potter instructed the jury tuesday night after closing arguments 
you cant lie to people to send you money its that 
simple prosecutor deborah smith told the jury 
you cant tell halftruths if you do it if you use the 
postal service and the public airwaves you will find yourself in 
federal court answering charges of mail and wire fraud thats why 
were here today because thats just what mr bakker did 
bakkers attorneys said he was a victim of circumstances and a 
minister worried about the survival of his church 
i think 95 percent of the evidence in this case by the 
government is circumstantial said defense attorney george davis 
the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
defendant had specific intent to commit fraud davis said he 
was conducting a ministry he was doing what he thought was vital 
to the survival of his ministry 
smith insisted that the case was about money not religion 
what unfolded before you over the past month was a tale of 
corruption immense corruption what was revealed here was 
that mr bakker was a worldclass master of lies and halftruths 
if convicted on all counts bakker faces up to 120 years in 
prison and more than 5 million in fines

meanwhile pentagon officials said the routine military 
exercises have been conducted all week on thoroughfares in panama

secure a causeway and a bridge on the pan american highway which

a jury recommended wednesday that convicted 
night stalker richard ramirez die in the gas chamber and the 
devilworshiping serial killer snarled big deal death always 
went with the territory see you in disneyland 
ramirez convicted of 13 savage murders rocked in his chair and 
peered around at courtroom spectators seated behind him as superior 
court judge michael a tynan read aloud the jurys recommendations 
count by count 
jurors found ramirez deserved the death penalty on 19 special 
circumstances attached to felony convictions that included multiple 
murders burglary and sex crimes 
state law requires a separate jury finding of special 
circumstances before the death penalty can be imposed as of oct 
2 there were 265 inmates on death row in california 
tynan will consider the jurys recommendations before he 
formally sentences ramirez on nov 7 the facts of the case 
however made it unlikely the judge would reduce the sentence to 
life in prison without the possibility of parole the only other 
possible sentence 
under california law the death sentence will be automatically 
appealed 
ramirez made no comment in the courtroom but uttered his 
disneyland remark to reporters while being taken back to jail 
he apparently was referring to his lawyers contention to the jury 
that life in prison was sufficient he will never see disneyland 
again lawyer ray clark had said 
the judge thanked the jurors profusely for the year they had 
spent on the case im very proud of you he told them i 
know you had a tough time of it it was a very emotionally 
charged case i want to thank you for the public god bless you 
i have nightmares all the time about the crimes said juror 
cynthia haden ill get over it but ill never be the same ill 
never look at people the same 
how are you going to return to a normal life after going 
through something like this asked another juror bonita smith 
the jurys deliberations lasted five days in the death penalty 
phase of the trial the jurors did not look at ramirez as the word 
death was pronounced 19 times by tynan but they answered in 
firm voices yes your honor when the judge polled them 
individually 
juror alfredo carrillo said there was little dissension among 
jurors over whether to recommend the death penalty the panel took 
its time simply because there were so many counts 
it took a lot of thinking he said he added about ramirez 
i think hes a pretty crazy man 
he got what he deserved said deputy district attorney p 
philip halpin who had urged the death penalty describing ramirez 
to the jury as a miserable human being who killed for 
selfgratification defense attorney ray clark had pleaded for

the coast guard seized a ship carrying 11500 
pounds of cocaine the largest maritime cocaine seizure in 
history coast guard officials said wednesday 
the zedom sea a 185foot offshore supply vessel reportedly 
headed from colombia but flying the panamanian flag is being 
escorted to new orleans said rear adm william f merlin nine 
people aboard were arrested and will be turned over to the drug 
enforcement administration he said 
we are not sure we have found all the cocaine merlin said 
at a news conference at regional coast guard headquarters here 
we are turning it over to customs 
the vessel was seized monday when the crew of the cutter cushing 
boarded it in the gulf of mexico off the yucatan peninsula merlin 
said it was expected to dock early thursday 
the cocaine was hidden on the deck in huge shipping containers 
the size of railroad box cars merlin said it was mixed among a 
cargo of portland cement and in fake walls of the containers he 
said 
merlin said the coast guard has been patrolling the western gulf 
on the lookout for possible smugglers and found the ship headed due 
west about 60 miles northwest of progreso a port on the yucatan 
all ships in the yucatan channel are suspect to us at this 
time merlin said 
he said the boarding crew became suspicious because the vessel 
was listed as hauling cement and gelatin described as an unusual 
cargo in addition he said the ships registry gave its 
destination as vera cruz but the captain said it was going to 
tampico 
the ship was reportedly coming from baranquilla colombia said 
lt pat philbin 
in washington coast guard lt cmdr jim simpson called it the 
largest maritime cocaine seizure in history and added this 
gives us a pretty good run 
last weekend he said the coast guard seized 2000 to 2500 
pounds of cocaine in a ship near puerto rico and on monday seized 
about 1000 pounds of the drug from an air drop near that island 
in this fiscal year which began sunday weve gotten 
about as much as we got all last year he said 
in fiscal 1989 the coast guard seized a total of about 12000 
pounds of cocaine he said 
we had a real lull after things in colombia went crazy 
simpson said referring to the colombian governments crackdown on 
drug traffickers that began aug 18 after the assassination of a 
leading presidential candidate 
for a long time we didnt see anything he said until 
sept 10 when the coast guard seized about 1200 pounds of cocaine 
offshore from miami after a long lull things are moving again 
the latest seizure follows by less than a week the largest 
cocaine seizure in history about 20 tons found in a warehouse in 
los angeles the only seizure close to that was nearly 12 tons in 
colombia 
the largest previous maritime seizure of cocaine occurred in 
november 1987 in fort lauderdale fla where officials found more 
than 8700 pounds of cocaine in hollowedout lumber that had been 
cut for patio furniture

officers trying to depose gen manuel 
antonio noriega held him hostage for up to five hours but let him 
go after loyal forces told his captors they would face the 
consequences if any harm came to the general a noriega aide said 
wednesday 
lt col arnulfo castrejon director for the panamanian defense 
forces security and defense committee told journalists that during 
the coup attempt on tuesday noriega had tried to calm his 
captors during the time he was held trying to avoid a bloodshed 
lowerranking officers attempting the coup were defeated after 
loyal forces surrounded defense forces headquarters and 
counterattacked 
the surrender came when the loyal officers took command of the 
combat units and gave the rebels a last chance to release the 
commander and members of his staff or face the consequences 
castrejon said the general was a hostage for four hours 
later castrejon said noriega was held for five hours it was not 
clear if noriega was released before or after the final violent 
assault on the headquarters that led to the rebel forces surrender 
he was confident that elite forces and the special forces and 
rest of the officers and soldiers of the defense forces were going 
to solve the problem immediately as it happened castrejon added 
castrejon spoke briefly to reporters in front of defense forces 
headquarters wednesday and did not say who coordinated the rescue 
and counterattack operation 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity in 
washington said they were mystified by the decision to let noriega 
go 
noriega was in their clutches said one us official 
wednesday 
the united states has been trying to oust noriega since february 
1988 when he was indicted on drug trafficking and money laundering 
charges in florida 
if things had gone right for the rebels noriega would have 
been at night court in miami listening to a judge telling him he 
was being detained without bail one us official said wistfully 
however us secretary of defense dick cheney said us 
officials didnt know how long noriega had been held and told 
reporters clearly they his captors were not of a mind to turn 
him over to us 
in panama city neighbors said they saw noriega enter defense 
forces headquarters with members of his staff tuesday morning and 
that the shooting began about 10 minutes later they spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
during the fighting castrejon made a television announcement 
saying noriega was in an undisclosed location and was in radio 
contact with his troops 
later maj edgardo lopez a defense forces spokesman said 
noriega had personally taken the rebels surrender meaning he was 
on the spot when the fighting ended 
the headquarters building is a fourstory structure that 
occupies an entire city block the urraca company whose soldiers 
were involved in the coup attempt is located in barracks across a 
small patio in the same defense forces compound that extends for 
several hundred yards along panama bay 
jose blandon a panamanian defector once close to noriega said 
in washington he had been told by a coup leader over the telephone 
during the uprising that the general had been wounded but when 
noriega appeared before television cameras later there was no sign 
of an injury 
asked why the rebels would decide to free noriega one us 
official said its crazy i dont understand it 
the us officials said they are concerned that the rebels face 
a bleak future in detention the sources said some of the 
insurgents involved in the march 1988 uprising are still being 
tortured 
us officials have refused to comment on reports that some of 
the rebels took refuge at us southern command headquarters in 
quarry heights a few hundred yards from the fighting 
asked if anything positive occurred during tuesdays events the 
officials said noriega had tried hard through purges to ensure the 
loyalty of the defense forces but was still unable to head off an 
uprising 
tuesdays coup attempt also was much closer to succeeding than 
the 1988 insurrection the officials said adding that noriegas 
own behavior tuesday evening indicated how close he had come to 
being deposed 
noriega was ebullient after riding out the earlier coup and was 
far more subdued this time they said 
by wednesday however noriega leaned out a window to wave to a 
cheering crowd of supporters outside his bulletpocked headquarters

panamas provisional president on 
wednesday blamed the aborted coup against gen manuel antonio 
noriega on a small group of disgruntled soldiers backed by the 
united states 
in remarks to reporters provisional president francisco 
rodriguez asserted tuesdays attempted coup was fostered and 
supported by the government of the united states but that it 
found no resonance of any kind within the ranks of the defense 
forces or citizens 
he asserted there was no widespread dissatisfaction in the 
panamanian military noriega the defense forces chief uses his 
official position to maintain de facto control of the government 
in tuesdays coup attempt rebel forces attacked and seized the 
defense forces headquarters in panama city and claimed to have 
ousted noriega but forces loyal to noriega counterattacked and 
took back the compound several hours later 
the panamanian military said about 65 rebel soldiers were 
detained 
in his comments rodriguez claimed videotapes show us tanks 
and us contingents in combat readiness blocking roads in our 
country in order to prevent contingents of the defense forces from 
having access to the headquarters he said film and photographs 
would also be release as proof 
president bush has denied the united states engineered the 
attempt to overthrow noriega but white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said us officials had advance knowledge of it 
us officials said american forces moved into positions near 
the fighting for security reasons 
rodriguez was asked why a superpower like the united states 
would not be able to topple noriega if it really wanted to support 
a coup 
it is clear that overt aggression backed by actual troops of 
the us army would make everything too clear and they really 
wanted to cover up their ambitions in this area but there is clear 
evidence photographs and so on that there was support from the 
us army stationed in our country said rodriguez 
he said his provisional government will evaluate whether to 
hold national elections some time after march but that panama 
cannot hold free and fair elections until the united states ends 
its military and economic aggression 
the us government has been trying to force out noriega since 
two federal grand juries in florida indicted him on 
drugtrafficking and moneylaundering charges last year 
us efforts have included diplomatic pressure and trade and 
economic sanctions against panama 
but the steps have not budged noriega whose government annulled 
may 7 presidential elections international observers said 
opposition candidate guillermo endara won the presidency by a 
landslide 
rodriguez a longstanding associate of noriega was installed as 
a provisional president after the election was nullified

tens of thousands of boeing co machinists 
angered by what they called a stingy wage offer from the aerospace 
giant hit the picket lines wednesday and said they would remain on 
strike until they got a better offer 
pickets walked in 45degree weather outside one of boeings 
seattle plants waving signs as motorists and truck drivers honked 
horns 
the attitudes good said machinist brian mctighe people 
are willing to picket willing to do whatever it takes the 
attitude seems to be militant 
the machinists union which represents 43000 boeing workers in 
the puget sound area 12000 at boeings wichita kan plant 
1700 in portland ore and smaller numbers in a halfdozen other 
locations struck at 1201 am pdt when its contract expired 
federal mediator douglas hammond who joined the talks over the 
weekend said he wanted negotiations to resume quickly between the 
two sides because of the number of people affected and the 
potential impact of a long strike at boeing washingtons largest 
private employer 
no talks were announced although both sides indicated tuesday 
they were willing to resume negotiating 
members of other unions reported to work wednesday and boeing 
continued production work in the seattle area with management and 
nonunion employees 
boeing spokesman russ young said the strike began peacefully 
with no reports of friction at any of the companys plants 
however at the request of boeing lawyers a federal judge in 
wichita issued an injunction limiting the number of pickets at 
boeing gates and prohibiting pickets from speaking in an abusive or 
intimidating manner to employees trying to report for work 
the order was granted after pickets stopped each vehicle headed 
toward the plant attempting to persuade the occupants to honor 
strike lines traffic was snarled with delays of three hours or 
more reported 
boeings contract offer included an immediate raise of 4 percent 
with 3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991 plus annual bonuses of 
8 percent of a workers gross earnings this year and 3 percent the 
next 
workers havent had an increase in base wages which determine 
pensions and other benefits for six years although boeing paid 
bonuses of 12 percent in 1986 and 5 percent in 1987 and 1988 
the proposal also would have reduced compulsory overtime from 
200 hours a quarter to 160 hours and boosted some benefits and the 
costofliving adjustment 
for the average machinist making 1339 per hour the offer 
would have meant an additional 13800 in income over the next 
three years 
the machinists have declined to disclose their exact bargaining 
position however members have indicated they were disappointed by 
the proposed pay raise from boeing which is enjoying record 
prosperity and were upset the offer did not end mandatory overtime 
most people we talked to were basically insulted by the 
contract said picket bryce bushby 
worldwide boeing employs 144725 people including 106000 in 
western washington the company posted a profit of 614 million on 
1696 billion in sales last year 
the strike hits boeing in its fifth consecutive year of record 
jetliner orders as airlines update aging fleets the wave of orders 
has caused huge backlogs pressuring boeing to maintain delivery 
schedules and forcing workers to put in heavy overtime 
although pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business for 
boeings other divisions boeing commercial airplanes has a backlog 
of nearly 1600 jets worth about 70 billion and deliveries 
extending well into the mid1990s 
the machinists union represents the bulk of the companys 
production workers who perform tasks ranging from riveting wiring 
and plumbing in aircraft to quality inspections and machinetool 
maintenance 
young declined to say how the strike would affect boeings 
aircraft deliveries and said there were no immediate plans to bring 
in outside workers

senate democrats put the brakes on a bill to 
ban flag desecration late wednesday saying a pair of 
republicansponsored changes in the wording would leave it 
vulnerable to a supreme court challenge 
the one thing we are required to avoid doing or giving the 
court an excuse to suggest we are doing is to proscribe any 
communicative ideas any speech sen joseph biden ddel 
said as the senate postponed action 
he said however that the court might well interpret the 
proposed changes as an effort to limit freedom of speech 
sponsors had expected to pass the bill wednesday afternoon but 
instead ended up hoping to win approval on thursday 
the bill is a response to the uproar that followed a decision by 
the supreme court that overturned a texas flagburning ban last 
june 
lawmakers also acknowledged that the bill represents a move to 
head off a proposed constitutional amendment against flagburning 
set to come before the senate in midoctober 
a number of senators mainly democrats say amending the 
constitution is not the proper way to deal with the issue but many 
other lawmakers say it is the only way to get around the court 
decision 
president bush has called for a constitutional amendment against 
flag burning as have many congressional conservatives 
at issue were only three words that republicans sought to add to 
the housepassed legislation 
one amendment offered by minority leader bob dole rkan would 
make it clear that flag desecration was banned only if it occurred 
publicly 
the other sponsored by sen pete wilson rcalif would make 
it illegal to physically defile the flag 
the supreme court in the texas case ruled in effect that 
flagburner gregory lee johnson was convicted not for setting a 
flag afire but because he was engaging in political protest it 
said that limited his freedom of speech and overturned the law on 
that ground 
bill sponsors want the measure to avoid that problem by banning 
any flag desecration regardless of whether it involves political 
protest 
debate over exactly what the republican amendments would do 
meandered into semantic thickets unusual even for the senate floor 
biden said drily it was too bad former sen si hayakawa 
rcalif a noted authority on semantics as well as a politician 
was not still around to help out with the debate 
the bill differs only slightly from an existing federal law 
against flag burning 
current law bans any action that knowingly casts contempt upon 
any flag of the united states by publicly mutilating defacing 
defiling burning or trampling upon it it provides for penalties 
of up to a 1000 fine and a year in jail the texas law had a 
similar wording 
the statutory approach in my opinion is a futile and 
ineffective gesture which will not pass the constitutional test at 
all hatch said 
some critics said that there is no wide outbreak of flag burning 
in the united states and that the bill would encroach on freedom of 
speech as a means of fighting a danger that does not exist 
its not needed for the maintenance of democratic freedom 
sen bob kerrey dneb said 
of all things today in the united states of america we need 
to encourage our people to be less afraid speaking what they 
believe letting their minds and hearts give rise to what they 
truly think ought to be done kerrey told the senate 
kennedy also said provisions of the measure designed to make 
sure it would not be interpreted as an attack on dissent would be 
difficult to deal with for example the measure would ban flag 
desecration in private 
it will criminalize a great deal of relatively trivial 
behavior he said it will change the flag from a treasured 
symbol to a governmentregulated icon 
lawmakers made it clear from the outset however that the bill 
was popular enough to guarantee overwhelming approval 
i am going to vote for this sen terry sanford dnc 
said the people of my state are for it 
the flag represents the very heart of what it means to be an 
american and it would be a tragedy for us to let its power be 
undermined through legal desecration sen howell heflin dala 
said

anger mounted on capitol hill wednesday among 
both democrats and republicans at president bushs handling of the 
failed coup attempt in panama with one senior gop lawmaker saying 
we blew it 
but others after being briefed by defense secretary dick 
cheney said they agreed with the administrations caution in the 
face of weak intelligence flowing in from panama during the 
uprising on tuesday 
rep ike skelton dmo likened the situation to the failed 
attempt by exiled cubans to invade at the bay of pigs in 1961 when 
us support was withheld at the crucial moment 
why have 12000 troops in panama who are highly motivated and 
trained and not use them in either a military or a paramilitary 
manner asked skelton a member of the house armed services 
committee 
we had full knowledge they were going to do this im afraid 
its a matter of cold feet skelton said in an interview it 
was a conscious decision by bush not to assist im furious 
about it 
on his way to the briefing cheney told reporters the 
administration believes noriega was in the control of the rebels 
for a time though it had not been clear during the uprising this 
was the case 
clearly they were not of the mind to turn him over to us 
cheney said 
noriega is under federal indictment in florida for drug 
trafficking 
later after the hourlong cheney briefing skelton said the 
administrations doubts werent sufficient justification for 
inaction they wanted certainty well you do not get an engraved 
invitation to a coup they just lacked boldness 
we look indecisive vacillating and weak said rep henry 
hyde rill the consequences from this could be profound 
we blew it said rep william broomfield of michigan the 
senior republican on the house foreign affairs committee 
its a major setback for our foreign policy it raises 
questions whether people down there can ever have confidence in the 
united states 
broomfield said if the white house had advance knowledge of the 
coup plans and had called in senior congressional leaders the 
administration would have found ample support for a limited 
military response to the uprising 
sen jim sasser dtenn who attended the closed briefing 
conducted by cheney and gen colin powell chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff for members of the senate raised questions about 
the united states intelligence capability in panama 
it would appear to me that we would have better intelligence 
sources in panama than we have sasser told reporters the fact 
that this coup materialized we dont have notice of it sooner than 
we did we could not have reacted quicker to it i think its some 
indication that our intelligence sources in panama are not as 
adequate as we have a right to expect them to be given our long 
presence in that country 
asked after the senate briefing what the coup attempt means for 
noriega cheney said if i was in general noriegas shoes id be 
a very nervous man tonight heres a guy whose got to have doubts 
given the fact that one of his close supporters tried to run a coup 
on him that cant give him great confidence about his own 
security 
there were some lawmakers supportive of bushs decision as well 
the president was absolutely correct said rep joseph 
mcdade rpa were not an invading force wed like to see 
general noriega out but i support the president in what he did 
they deserve credit for the coolness and calmness they 
displayed under very difficult circumstances said rep stephen 
solarz dny 
opponents of bushs inaction were far more vocal 
armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis said the 
administration apparently has decided on a policy of not using 
force in panama 
any disturbance like this should have provided the necessary 
cover and opportunity to move with military force against 
noriega aspin said we ought to be ready at any opportunity 
they did not seize the moment 
this is laissezfaire diplomacy and its outrageous said 
rep dave mccurdy dokla a member of the house intelligence 
committee he said it would apparently have been relatively easy to 
support the rebels but the administration blinked 
yesterday makes jimmy carter look like a man of resolve 
theres a resurgence of the wimp factor mccurdy said 
there is a role for force in our foreign policy bush would 
have come off as a hero in america and probably throughout central 
america now instead we have a major credibility problem 
lack of us support for the rebels makes it even more remote 
that any members of the panamanian military will risk another 
uprising he said whos going to volunteer to do this now

human rights activists and the leaders of 
democratic forces in communist eastern europe were high on the list 
of 90 candidates for the nobel peace prize to be announced 
thursday 
the peace prize is given by a fivemember committee chosen by 
the norwegian parliament and the other nobels are awarded by the 
prize committee in stockholm sweden 
candidates included abbe pierre a french roman catholic priest 
nominated for humanitarian work bruno hussar who set up an 
israelipalestinian peace village in israel nelson mandela the 
imprisoned black south african leader and the international scout 
movement celebrating its 100th year 
sources who have been reliable in the past said the dalai lama 
exiled godking of tibetan buddhists had a chance of being chosen 
but the ferment in eastern europe caused speculation that the prize 
would go a democratic leader in the region 
often in recent years the peace prize has been used to

security forces arrested three 
members of gen manuel antonio noriegas general staff and about 35 
other soldiers after a failed coup according to a war 
communique read over national radio wednesday 
panamanian officials also said rebelling troops held noriega for 
several hours during the attempted coup tuesday but that the coups 
leader was killed during the fighting 
the communique did not give any reason for the arrests of col 
guillermo wong the head of state security and two other members 
of the 20member high command the panamanian equivalent of a 
general staff 
if members of the high command were implicated in the coup 
however it would mean the plotting against noriega extended much 
higher than the lowerlevel officers involved in the rebellion 
in those clashes rebel soldiers captured the headquarters in 
panama city but troops loyal to noriega recaptured the compound 
several hours later 
wednesdays government communique said 10 rebels were killed in 
the fighting and 26 people were wounded there were 18 wounded in 
forces loyal to defense forces chief noriega three from the rebel 
forces and five civilians it said 
the communique also said five coup leaders had taken refuge at 
fort clayton a us base a few miles from panama city us 
officials have refused comment on that report 
the other two arrested members of the high command were col 
julio ow young and col armando palacios gondola both had recently 
served as defense forces representatives when the 
noriegacontrolled government held talks with the civil opposition 
in august 
in addition palacios was a member of the combined staff of us 
and panamanian officers that deals with panama canal security and 
defense issues 
defense forces spokesmen were not available for comment on the 
arrests according to people who answered phones at headquarters 
the communique read by an announcer did nothing more than list 
the names and ranks of those arrested wounded or killed 
earlier maj edgardo lopez a defense forces spokesman said at 
least 60 soldiers and four of five officers had been arrested 
shortly after the fighting 
the arrest of ow young was puzzling because the officers who 
mounted tuesdays coup effort had named him as an officer to be 
forcibly retired 
one report said the lowerlevel officers who rebelled were 
disgruntled over not being promoted in their only communique the 
rebels said they were discarding the entire high command that 
communique was signed by a major and tw captains 
the other 20 officers arrested ranged in rank from second 
lieutenant to captain about 15 sergeants corporals and enlisted 
men were also under arrest the communique said 
the communique also said 10 rebels including nine officers 
died in the shooting tuesday it said the dead included maj moises 
giroldi vega commander of the urraca company which was blamed for 
the revolt the unit is in charge of security at defense 
headquarters 
around panama city government troops patrolled lightly traveled 
streets wednesday while us helicopters watched from overhead 
the gringo piranhas want to do away with me the general 
said during a brief tour of the street outside panamanian defense 
forces headquarters noriega has accused the united states of 
supporting the attempted coup 
the united states has been trying to oust noriega for almost two 
years but the bush administration denied any involved in tuesdays 
coup attempt 
later in the day several thousand people many of them public 
employees demonstrated in front of the building to show their 
support for noriega the general leaned out a secondstory window 
and waved through iron bars 
a noriega aide said wednesday that rebel officers trying to 
depose noriega captured him and held him for several hours tuesday 
but released him after loyal forces warned the rebels would face 
the consequences if he was harmed 
lt col arnulfo castrejon director for the defense forces 
security and defense committee told reporters that while being 
held tuesday noriega had tried to calm his captors trying to 
avoid bloodshed 
the surrender came when the loyal officers took command of the 
combat units and gave the rebels a last chance to release the 
commander and members of his staff or face the consequences 
castrejon said the general was a hostage for four hours 
later however castrejon said noriega was held five hours it 
was not clear if noriega was held when the final assault was made 
by loyal troops 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity in 
washington said earlier wednesday they were mystified by the 
decision to let noriega go 
the united states has been imposed economic sanctions and tried 
other measures to oust noriega after he was indicted on us drug 
trafficking and money laundering charges in florida in february 
1988 noriega denies the charges 
in panama city neighbors said they saw noriega enter defense 
forces headquarters with members of his staff tuesday morning and 
that the shooting began about 10 minutes later they spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
during the fighting castrejon made a tv announcement saying 
noriega was in an undisclosed location and was in radio contact 
with his troops 
later lopez the defense forces spokesman said noriega had 
personally taken the rebels surrender meaning he was on the spot 
when the fighting ended 
many panamanians chose to stay home wednesday and us bases 
were shut under condition delta which restricts movement of 
personnel about 12000 american soldiers are stationed in panama 
the uprising aggravated the panamanian crisis in every 
dimension and makes it more dangerous opposition leader ricardo 
arias calderon told a news conference he said the military regime 
is divided against itself and rejected by the great majority of 
the people 
civilian foes of noriega denied involvement 
us sanctions have damaged the economy but noriega remains he 
annulled the oppositions election victory may 7 and has put down 
two coup attempts 
after the battle tuesday noriega replaced the 350member urraca 
company with the machos de monte or wild boars a unit that 
joined the counterattack 
at the united nations in new york president francisco rodriguez 
told a news conference the coup was attempted by a small group of 
soldiers fostered and supported by the government of the united 
states that found no resonance of any kind within the ranks of 
the defense forces or citizens

dr joseph wybran the leader of 
belgiums jewish community was shot to death in a hospital parking 
lot in what the justice minister on wednesday called an act of 
terrorism 
police said wybran 49 was shot once in the head from close 
range at about 6 pm tuesday as he approached his car outside 
brussels university hospital where he headed the immunology 
department he underwent emergency surgery but died early wednesday 
no one claimed responsibility 
wybran head of a coalition of jewish groups was a moderate in 
the israeliarab conflict he campaigned for removal of a roman 
catholic convent from the site of the auschwitz concentration camp 
in poland 
justice minister melchior wathelet told a radio station 
wednesday this coldblooded murder committed with such 
efficiency points to a terrorist act probably linked to the role 
dr wybran played at the head of the jewish community even worse 
because of his moderation 
there were no witnesses police made a nationwide appeal for 
information 
police were investigating whether the killing was antisemitic 
or political 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel said wybran would go 
down in history as an example of a jew who fought for the sake of 
his people 
a statement from the israeli embassy said wybran had no personal 
enemies and it is therefore evident that he was assassinated 
in cold blood because he was a jew 
michel peytier a spokesman for the brussels prosecutors 
office said given the nature of his activities it cannot be 
excluded that this was a political attack 
he added that at first sight it is very unlikely not to say 
beyond probability that wybran was killed for private reasons 
prime minister wilfried martens issued a statement expressing 
indignation at violence and intolerance 
wybran headed the coordinating committee of jewish organizations 
in belgium which represents about 30000 jews in this 
overwhelmingly catholic country of 99 million 
he also served as chairman of the belgian chapter of the 
auschwitz committee which has pressed for removal of an order of 
carmelite nuns from the site of the former nazi death camp 
on a recent visit to poland wybran urged authorities to 
publicly oppose antisemitism and other forms of racism 
jewish leaders say the convent and its religious symbols are 
offensive at place where 25 million jews were killed 
the church has said it will move the convent to an interfaith 
center to be built nearby 
israeli ambassador avi primor told israeli army radio wednesday 
that neonazis might have been behind wybrans murder because of 
his involvement in the auschwitz matter 
in 1980 one youngster was killed in a grenade attack in 
brussels on 50 jewish teenagers bound for summer camp three 
people were killed the next year when an explosivesladen van blew 
up outside an antwerp synagogue and in 1982 attackers sprayed a 
brussels synagogue with automatic weapons fire wounding four 
people

the treasury department is planning 
regulations aimed at moneylaundering by international wire 
transfer a treasury official said wednesday night 
another initiative soon will require banks to report domestic 
currency deposits of more than 10000 on computer tapes this 
official said 
the current reports of those large deposits are made on paper 
forms the banks file millions of those year in and year out it 
creates an avalanche of paper that is extremely difficult to 
handle by law enforcement agencies trying to track drug profits 
the official said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said he was 
summarizing testimony earlier in the day by salvatore r martoche 
assistant secretary of the treasury for enforcement before the 
senate foreign relations subcommittee on terrorism narcotics and 
international operations 
just as they report large domestic deposits banks report 
transfers of large sums of cash to and from foreign banks but 
there is no requirement to report international wire transfers 
used increasingly by drug traffickers to move profits to safe 
havens 
it is very difficult to draft regulations in this area the 
official said we will be looking very carefully at what can be 
done 
the official declined to say what the substance of international 
wire transfer regulations might be 
we had meetings six weeks ago with foreign countries in paris 
we do have some discussions under way and further discussions will 
be held as to what comes out of them you will have to check back 
in a few months he said

prosecution and defense attorneys rested 
their cases wednesday in the 3yearold mcmartin preschool 
molestation trial setting the stage for closing arguments to begin 
next week 
superior court judge william pounders who often expressed fear 
that the case would end in a mistrial scheduled lawyers 
summations to begin oct 12 and said he expects the matter to go to 
the jury by nov 1 
pounders said he expects the balance of the case including jury 
deiberations to take up to three months ive got three months 
to keep 12 jurors together and that makes me nervous he added 
the trial is the longest criminal proceeding in us history 
its cost of 15 million has made it the most expensive case ever 
tried in los angeles 
raymond buckey 31 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 62 
are charged with 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of 
conspiracy involving alleged molestations of 11 children at their 
family owned school 
this is almost as exciting as the day we started jury 
selection deputy district attorney roger gunson said after both 
sides had rested 
defense attorney danny davis said he believed the case could 
have been tried in four months if the prosecution had trimmed the 
number of charges and witnesses he said that by now jurors 
probably do not remember much of the voluminous evidence but he 
predicted a swift verdict acquitting the buckeys 
my prognosis is within two weeks after we submit it to the 
jury well have a verdict you cant come to the same room for two 
years and not form an opinion on what youre going to do 
the case began in 1983 as the largest child molestation 
prosecution ever seven teachers at the prestigious mcmartin 
preschool in manhattan beach were arrested and it was alleged that 
hundreds of children had been molested during a fiveyear period 
but after an 18month preliminary hearing charges were dropped 
against five defendants by district attorney ira reiner who said 
there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them 
by then the number of children allegedly involved had also 
dropped 
since the trial began in april 1987 the jury of 12 with a backup 
panel of six alternates has dwindled due to illness and employment 
problems the last alternate was used recently to replace an ailing 
juror a panel of 12 is required for a verdict in a criminal case 
the prosecutions initial presentation of evidence took 14 
months and the defense took 10 months the prosecution also 
presented about a month of rebuttal testimony 
in april the trial became the longest in california and us 
history surpassing the twoyear record of the hillside strangler 
case

more than 100 coast guard personnel 
were joined by park rangers wednesday in the search for eight 
people missing after a fishing boat struck a gas pipeline and 
exploded in the gulf of mexico 
three people were killed and three others injured in the 
accident which happened just before dark tuesday the 
20squaremile search was hampered by the suspected presence of 
hazardous chemicals 
if they were presumed dead we wouldnt be searching coast 
guard lt scott larochelle said the probability is high but 
there is still a possibility of survivors theres always a 
hope 
two hazardous waste material experts boarded the boat later 
wednesday but found no missing crew members or dangerous chemicals 
officials said 
the search was suspended later wednesday but was expected to 
continue thrusday 
mike benson spokesman for the national transportation safety 
board in washington said the agency was sending a team to 
investigate the fivemember team was expected to arrive in nearby 
port arthur late wednesday 
a small fire continued to burn 18 hours after the 160foot 
north umberland apparently hit the 16inch natural gas 
pipeline triggering a spectacular blaze that sent flames hundreds 
of feet into the air larochelle said 
the main fire burned itself out wednesday morning after the 
pipeline was turned off 
officials speculated that nets being trawled by the boat snagged 
the submerged pipeline and ruptured it triggering the explosion 
as divers stood by to inspect the ruptured pipeline and burned 
boat coast guard officials kept everyone 700 yards away from the 
wreck they were concerned about the possible presence of anhydrous 
ammonia a flammable coolant used on board fishing boats to 
preserve the catch 
the coast guard dive team of hazardous material experts was sent 
from mobile ala with equipment to test the air and water in the 
area 
texas parks and wildlife department personnel meanwhile 
inspected 5 miles of beaches because prevailing currents would send 
survivors or victims toward the shore the coast guard said 
were hoping to find some concrete evidence that will give us 
some hope that some people are still alive larochelle said 
two victims and three survivors were spotted by private 
helicopters tuesday night a third was found just after noon 
wednesday 
the three injured survivors remained hospitalized in nearby 
beaumont 
lori kerr a spokeswoman at baptist hospital said names of the

the soviet union will keep withholding 
arms shipments to nicaragua to encourage the united states to take 
similar steps in central america officials announced wednesday 
the announcement was made in a nicaraguan government statement 
at the end of a 24hour visit by soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze the soviet official told reporters it amounted to a 
joint statement 
the communique said the suspension is a contribution nicaragua 
and the soviet union are making toward a total solution to the 
conflict in the region and a decided support of the central 
american presidential agreements 
president daniel ortega and the presidents of four other central 
american countries signed an agreement aug 7 calling for 
demobilizing the usbacked nicaraguan rebels based in border 
camps in honduras 
in exchange the leftist sandinista government agreed to make 
democratic reforms including allowing free campaigning by the 
opposition for elections advanced to february 1990 
the temporary halt to weapons shipments opens great 
opportunities shevardnadze said he said a total and permanent 
suspension in weapons shipments would have to be reciprocated 
by the united states 
however he said the region also needs a way of setting limits 
on combat forces in the central american countries 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev told president bush in may 
that the soviet union had suspended weapons shipments to nicaragua 
at the end of 1988 
soviet aid totaled 112 billion from 1980 to 1988 half of it 
in military assistance though it says it has cut off supplies of 
weapons the soviet union has still sent ortegas government 500 
million in various forms of military aid this year 
the united states has supported the nicaraguan contra rebels 
who have fought to overthrow the sandinistas however it halted 
weapons shipments to them in february 1988 while continuing such 
aid as uniforms food vehicles and other supplies 
however the sandinistas want the united states to cut off all 
aid to the rebels 
washington also provides military and economic aid to the 
salvadoran government in its 10yearold war against a leftist 
insurgency 
on the battlefront contra rebels attacked a military patrol in 
western nicaragua on wednesday killing six soldiers and wounding 
six the defense ministry said 
in a news release the ministry said the attack occurred near 
the village of puerto de paris 110 miles west of managua it gave 
no details of the fighting 
the government radio the voice of nicaragua called the attack 
cowardly and treacherous noting that the government has called 
a unilateral ceasefire in an effort to end the war 
also wednesday the interior ministry said two election 
officials were kidnapped by contras near the town of san nicolas 
about 80 miles north of managua its news release gave no details

filming a television special to be released later this year

his work doesnt appear in glossy 
architectural magazines and he draws no raves reviews for his 
timber frames collar beams and squat designs in bare concrete 
but the american john beynon wins praise in asia for designing 
schools that can stand up to cyclones floods and earthquakes 
no regrets said the 53yearold disaster architect when 
asked if he ever thinks about skyscrapers and glamorous homes he 
might have created 
here were dealing with very real urgent problems and these 
you find in the poorest and remotest areas theres more work than 
one can handle in a lifetime 
over the last few years a greater and more organized effort has 
been made in asia on minimizing the blows of natural forces part 
of the impetus has come from massive disasters as the 1985 cyclone 
that killed 10000 people in bangladesh and last years earthquake 
in armenia where 25000 people died 
as someone pointed out after the armenian earthquake 
earthquakes dont kill people buildings do beynon said 
there are very few natural disasters which should inevitably 
destroy a building 
the un educational scientific and cultural organization 
unesco where beynon serves as principal architect is focusing 
on disasterproofing school buildings in nearly 20 asian nations 
including bangladesh india the philippines and vietnam 
when there is a cyclone go to the school unesco advises 
asians in villages where the school building is a safe structure 
and homes tend to be flimsy if it survives a natural disaster the 
school often the largest building of the community serves as 
the obvious center for shelter and relief 
conversely rural children may suffer disproportionately high 
casualties in classrooms when natural disasters strike because the 
most densely populated area in an asian village is likely to be the 
school and its often not safe enough 
we dont like to talk to officials in the capitals beynon 
said we go to the end of the line 
in nepal this meant trekking for days to remote himalayan 
hamlets where he learned that while iron and concrete may make for 
the best earthquakeproofing these are hardly the materials to be 
carried in on the backs of porters material available in the area 
has to be used 
my first approach is to listen and learn from the people 
beynon said during the first week you forget everything you know 
and look at the problem through their eyes and skills and then you 
try to improve on this the greatest disaster is the instant 
expert 
beynon tries to persuade planners that for only a little added 
to a schools total cost 3 percent to 15 percent in the case of 
cyclone protection they can save lives as well as money in the 
long term 
he tries to get local barefoot architects to provide ideas 
and skills unesco gives assistance and training in the concepts of 
disaster architecture 
to resist cyclones a general term for typhoons hurricanes and 
tropical storms structures must be designed from the top down the 
great wind force of a cyclone tends to lift buildings upwards so a 
system of special attachments running from roof to foundation must 
be incorporated to figuratively chain them down 
to minimize earthquake damage schools are designed to move 
with rather than against the various motions unleashed by seismic 
disturbances structures must be flexible yet also held together by 
encompassing bands of iron wood or other materials 
schools in floodprone regions are best set above the ground 
they should include a waterproof room where equipment can quickly 
be secured as well as cooking and toilet facilities for those who 
take shelter since the school could serve as a final refuge and a 
platform for relief supplies from the sky the roof must be built 
flat and strong 
beynon accumulated his skills at the massachusetts institute of 
technology where he studied architecture and while working for an 
american foundation sponsoring innovative work in educational 
design 
he joined unesco in 1964 in paris moving in 1980 to its asian 
headquarters in bangkok where his team includes another architect 
a civil engineer and a furniture designer 
beynon was called to the island of tonga in the pacific in 1982 
after more than 10 percent of its schools were razed by tropical 
cyclone isaac since cyclones strike tonga in 20year cycles there 
had been little sense of urgency 
with beynons help cycloneproof schools were designed and put 
up prefabricated construction was used for schools on outer 
islands that lacked skilled craftsmen 
well have to wait another 15 years to see how good our work 
was he said referring to the 20year cycles

the saudis have oil reserves that 
will easily last 100 more years but theyre looking for a more 
abundant resource for their energy sunshine 
the sun which raises temperatures to 120 degrees in summer 
disappears behind clouds only a few days a year and thats mainly 
in some of the higher plateau regions 
a 26 million solar village with 160 photovoltaic solar 
generators each containing 251 solar cells is operating in the 
desert 32 miles northwest of riyadh the capital 
built in 1982 as part of a 100 million saudius solar 
research cooperation agreement called soleras it is the largest 
facility of its kind in the world and one of 10 in existence 
us involvement in the project ended two years ago but saudi 
solar research continues 
saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter is hardly 
desperate for an alternative energy source but it is trying to 
lessen its economic dependence on oil 
solar energy is still prohibitively expensive and relatively 
inefficient 
current technology can convert only about 12 percent of the 
suns energy to electricity storage of the energy in solar 
batteries which last five to seven years adds about 30 percent to 
the production costs 
but officials at king abdulaziz center for science and 
technology a quasigovernmental organization that spearheads solar 
research are not discouraged 
we knew it would be expensive at first said fahad huraib 
the centers solar research program director 
but most of the money went into research it helped in 
promoting this type of technology to develop an energy source 
takes from 50 to 100 years 
the solar village contains a sophisticated solar laboratory 
where environmental effects on the efficiency of solar energy can 
be simulated and measured 
the villages original purpose was to use a concentrated 
photovoltaic system to convert the suns rays into 350 kilowatts of 
direct current electricity a day 
the beneficiaries are the 4000 residents of three nearby 
villages they received solargenerated electricity for five years 
their first source of reliable power 
the villages are now hooked into riyadhs main power grid which 
is also suppled by the solar village 
saudi authorities hope that in time solar energy will be used 
to bring electricity to all isolated villages 
huraib said that could encourage people to stay in their 
villages and help curb mass migration to the cities 
in other parts of saudi arabia solar projects are already 
running they include a water desalinization plant in the red sea 
industrial city of yanbu 
it produces 200 cubic meters 52600 gallons of water a day 
from indirect freezing techniques using solar energy huraib said 
concentrated heat from the sun produces steam that powers the 
refrigeration equipment for the system as seawater is chilled 
fresh water crystallizes and forms ice which is then washed and 
melted 
in southern saudi arabia highway tunnels through mountains are 
illuminated by onsite photovoltaic collectors 
huraib said the ministry of transportation and communications is 
studying the possibility of lighting all remote tunnels in this 
manner 
the kingdoms giant oil company saudi aramco is using solar 
energy to provide cathodic protection for some of its pipelines in 
the eastern province 
at the king abdulaziz center in riyadh solar thermal water 
heaters service all staff housing 
yassen alsaedi site manager at the solar village said that 
next year the center will begin experimenting with solargenerated 
irrigation on a halfacre vegetable plot 
but the most ambitious of the centers plans is a saudiwest 
german research and development project to produce hydrogen through 
solar energy 
hysolar will be the largest project of its kind in the 
world alsaedi said 
financed by the center and several west german government 
organizations the project will use the solar villages 
photovoltaic solar generators to produce hydrogen by splitting 
water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen 
its the fuel of the future alsaedi said 
three major saudi universities are also participating in the 
research 
the plan is to experiment with several possible consumer 
applications such as running internal combustion engines and as a 
fuel cell to produce electricity 
huraib does not rule out the possibility of exporting hydrogen 
it could be transported through the pipeline as a natural 
gas he said

the members of flash cadillac have 
worked hard for their phds in fun 
weve been going to every college in the west for 20 years but 
never go to class said kris moe the keyboard player 
they abandoned the traditional quest for national rock stardom 
after six miserable years in los angeles even after hitting gold 
and platinum with the soundtrack to american graffiti because 
los angeles just isnt their kind of town 
when we left boulder for la i called my mom said warren 
knight the bass guitar player she said do what you want to 
do but dont go out there and become one of those people we 
didnt 
knights mom by the way has been known to occupy her time 
protesting nuclear weapons and calling her kids for bail money 
so flash cadillac left california in the mid70s and moved back 
to colorado while theyre not getting rich theyre getting by 
and just about anybody who attended a college in the rocky 
mountains during the past 20 years knows who they are 
so does the national association of broadcasters where flash 
recently did a gig and the beach boys whove tried to take back a 
crowd after flash warmed up and so does american bandstand 
but getting back to colorado was the bands goal they like 
many other residents of the mountains figured the tradeoff of less 
money for a better life was an easy call 
its great to spend all day in the recording studio and walk 
out into paradise instead of on a street corner in la moe said 
their headquarters is a ranch above woodland park about 30 
miles west of colorado springs in clear view of pikes peak they 
call it freedonia the ranch a name taken from the marx brothers 
movie duck soup 
the place has a main house extensively remodeled a trout pond 
stateoftheart recording studio and other homes as well moe and 
linn phillips live there while the other four members live in 
colorado springs to be closer to offspring 
theres a duck or two in the pond and a neighbor grazes some 
cows on the property flash cadillac used to own livestock a cow 
by the name of pot roast but ducks and pet fish are easier 
the band plays rock n roll anybodys rock n roll and has 
a reputation for being about the best party band around even 
rolling stone magazine once gave them that honor 
they do have fun they talk of how they really dont remember 
what their first official appearance was in 1969 in boulder 
because their rehersals were so much fun they cant distinguish 
between those and their stage acts 
they made headlines in boulder almost right off the bat when 
they were banned from that hardpartying college town in 1971 the 
ban came at a time when the university of colorado was ranked as 
the nations top party college by playboy magazine 
it wasnt that we were really gross or out of line but they 
decided we didnt put in enough effort to keep things under 
control moe said 
the band had been playing bar gigs in boulder tulagis a 
saloon of some note in those years initially booked flash cadillac 
for a drown night allowing students to drink unlimited amounts 
of beer for 175 
a few weeks later tulagis compounded the problem by holding a 
drown night the same time as gross night and things got 
out of hand 
police had to be summoned cu grads say there was beer an inch 
deep in the place the prizes for the no skin no win dance 
project were in a word gross 
flash has cleaned up its act since then but not the fun 
quotient 
thats why we left la moe said all anybody does out 
there is spend all day yelling and screaming and arguing so you 
waste all your time and they end up calling the shots they take 
all of the credit and most of the money 
if you really want to play music you have to get away and do 
it we were all going nuts in la 
flash cadillac hasnt given up trying for national success the 
band is working on a couple of recordings one aimed at what they 
believe is a budding countryrock blend suited to their style 
if we operate at a reasonable regional level we can stay in 
business and play music moe said were living where we want 
to live go national sure but not at the expense of living in 
la or traveling around the country as an itinerant jukebox

take up the white mans burden 
send forth the best ye breed 
go bind your sons to exile 
to serve your captives need 
rudyard kipling 1899 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
they no longer speak of their task as the 
white mans burden but some missionaries perhaps influenced by 
a decade of selfindulgence and national boosterism are said to be 
exporting selfrighteousness with religion 
the organizer of a conference on racism and ethnocentrism among 
missionaries said mission officials have noticed some evangelists 
are heading overseas with a diminishing respect for native cultures 
and beliefs 
the reagan years i dont know how else to say it have 
lessened the sensitivities and commitment to this said paul 
yount of the national council of churches wed thought wed made 
some headway into this but now were not so sure 
daniel romero a mission director for the united church of 
christ recalled being shocked when a missionary couple referred to 
third world people as heathens 
to have that terminology used now i think is an insult to 
the religious communities around the world said romero general 
secretary of the mission program of the board of world ministries 
of the united church of christ 
mission officials discussed issues of racism and ethnocentrism 
in missionary selection in a workshop earlier this week at stony 
point ny the meeting was sponsored by the overseas personnel 
office of the division of overseas ministries of the national 
council 
member churches of the national council had some 4300 
missionaries overseas in 1985 slightly more than 10 percent of the 
total 43000 protestant missionaries according to yount 
yount director of overseas personnel for the council noted 
that many early missionaries took stands against colonial 
authorities and that missionaries have translated the bible into 
almost every language and dialect 
i would stress that the missionary heritage in this is both 
positive and problematic he said 
the conference was called because many mission officials felt 
the new generation of missionaries lacked sensitivity toward native 
cultures yount said 
the climate has changed yount said there is not the more 
widespread concern about the racism within our own culture 
classism within our own culture 
romero however said he thought it was some older missionaries 
who still carry some overtones of the past in which there is a 
bit of that white superiority that comes creeping in 
he recalled for example how several such missionaries had 
joked about the odd names they had encountered overseas despite 
being in the presence of natives of those countries 
i dont think they had the slightest notion it affected the 
people sitting there he said 
julie brown vice president of the division of overseas 
ministries for the christian church disciples of christ said her 
experience had been different 
i think the missionaries that the disciples are sending out 
today are less racist than the missionaries we were sending out 20 
years ago she said 
she said many missionaries from her church appointed for 
specific terms and specifically invited by overseas organizations 
speak not in terms of making a tremendous impact on the places 
they visit but of enriching their local churches when they come 
back 
missionaries who say their only reason for going overseas is 
that they feel called by god are the first people we weed out it 
usually means they have a paternalistic attitude she said 
romero sees hope for the future in the recruitment of younger 
missionaries and more minority missionaries 
there is great value to having people who have lived with 
racism who have lived with oppression in their own countries he 
said 
in addition churches are adjusting to vast shifts in 
membership with congregations swelling in africa and latin america 
as branches in europe and the united states remain merely stable 
or in some places wither 
brown noted that the disciples of christ will have more members 
in zaire than in the united states by the year 2000 and that the 
denomination has cut its corps of overseas missionaries in half to 
110 over two decades 
such changes have prompted new attitudes toward mission work 
yount said 
participants at a recent meeting of the world council of 
churches agreed he said that if were really going to have the 
sending of missionaries we really need to have the exchange of 
missionaries

after months of controversy and hours of 
debate an angry congressional argument over federal art subsidies 
could boil down to 30 seconds the standard length of a campaign 
ad on television 
we live in fear of how someone could portray our vote in a 
30second political ad said sen herbert h kohl dwis who 
nonetheless voted against sweeping restrictions proposed by sen 
jesse helms rnc on the use of funds by the national endowment 
for the arts but for the threat of electionyear reprisals kohl 
said helms proposal wouldnt have been treated as serious 
business 
helms said the issue was whether taxpayers should be forced to 
help pay for dirty pictures advertised as art his opponents said 
it was censorship versus artistic freedom 
as is customary both sides overstated the case at great length 
the definition of art is an issue for the academy not the 
legislature sen dan coats rind had said when the issue 
arose last summer the legislature proved that point coats 
supported the helms restrictions saying the question was one of 
controlling the use of tax dollars not deciding what is or isnt 
art 
but congress did take a role in that determination 25 years ago 
when the art subsidy system was created although it delegated the 
job of defining art to panels of experts in the hope it would be 
insulated against politics the arts endowment has made about 
85000 grants and only about 20 had been called into question 
before 
the insulation broke down four months ago over a 30000 nea 
subsidy to help finance a showing of 150 photographs by robert 
mapplethorpe among them pictures of homosexual acts and of naked 
children the exhibit was assembled by a philadelphia arts group 
after mapplethorpe died of aids early this year a second 
controversy arose over a 15000 grant to another photographer 
whose works included a picture of a crucifix in a jar of urine 
with those incitements some congressional punishment was 
inevitable congress voted to cut a symbolic 45000 out of the 
171 million nea budget for next year they set up a commission to 
study changes in the way the arts agency decides who should get 
subsidies and they voted a ban on federal aid to art that is 
obscene 
the latter provision will make it more difficult for the 
religious right to proceed with its threat to tell voters that 
members who voted against the sweeping helms amendment are on 
record in support of subsidized pornography 
helms complained last week that the system has the government 
support artists whose work the taxpayers wont support in the 
marketplace 
thats exactly what the system does advocates say that is why 
it is needed but this argument is not about support for starving 
artists it is over government aid to exhibits in this case 
photographs most voters would consider at least vulgar possibly 
obscene in any case offensive 
nobody in congress defended the photographs that stirred the 
dispute defenders of the nea system called support for those works 
mistakes in an operation that generally works well 
we fully recognize that no government can call artistic 
excellence into existence president lyndon b johnson said when 
the agency was created it must flow from the quality of the 
society and the good fortune of the nation nor should any 
government seek to restrict the freedom of the artist to pursue his 
calling in his own way 
the measure was designed to put the artistic decisions in the 
hands of outside experts not government but sen claiborne pell 
dri one of the sponsors of the original act said johnson meant 
freedom not license 
the line between the two always has been hard to find 
helms wanted congress to ban arts aid to anything denigrating 
religion or even nonreligion and to works deemed indecent 
or obscene those are difficult words to define but helms is a 
master at reducing complex issues to black and white test votes 
when his amendment was adopted on july 26 without a recorded vote 
helms said that any senator who wanted the government funding 
pornography should vote against him 
when it was scrapped in negotiations with the house helms 
revived the issue last thursday night and forced it to a roll call 
all i wanted was for the senators to look at the pictures and 
then vote as they please and then answer to the folks back home 
he said 
some day if you vote against this amendment said sen 
patrick j leahy dvt who did somebody is going to run 
that 30second ad and say senator soandso supports pornography 
senator soandso wants your tax dollars spent on pornography 
helms amendment was defeated 62 to 35 and a morningafter 
version was revised into the obscenity ban 
that leaves an issue and sends a message from now on the 
panels that decide who gets federal arts subsidies are likely to do 
their erring on the side of caution

well its not long days journey into 
night or anything 
comedian colin quinn the star of mtvs colin quinn back to 
brooklyn isnt after high art his comedy special airing 
saturday at 11 pm and sunday at 730 pm just wants to have 
fun any weird way it can 
back to brooklyn is composed of a series of sometimes 
bizarre sketches most of them mocking pop culture icons the 
halfhour show opens with a parody of the pretentious rock 
documentary rattle and hum about the irish band u2 
the show was a fantasy thing because there was so much freedom 
in what we could do quinn said in an interview mtv is not 
like the networks they just let you do what you want to do if you 
went to a network and said we want to parody rattle and hum 
theyd say whats that and then theyd say well the people 
in soandso dont know what that is 
mtv is not like that 
quinn is one of the cohosts on remote control mtvs 
irreverent offthewall game show that is also a hit in 
syndication 
on remote control quinn badly sings pop songs that 
contestants have to finish in colins wheel of torture 
another of the games fixtures players must undergo such tortures 
as a wet willie quinns wet finger is stuck into the players ear 
to win points 
like remote control back to brooklyn revels in poking 
fun at entertainers 
the skits include a spoof of a rap rock video and a performance 
by a combination lounge actcatholic priest like the robe the 
priest says of his vestments got it at the italian restaurant at 
the corner used to be a tablecloth ouch 
in another brief sketch quinn returns to his brooklyn home 
only to be upstaged by an unusual wake for his uncle dermott laid 
to rest with his glasses on 
and in a parody titled i dream of gina quinn delivers a 
fairly accurate but weird imitation of robert de niro as a man 
convinced his wife is casting magic spells on all the men she meets 
everything is getting so serious there are not enough people 
out there trying to break down things quinn said 
i think audiences are dying for it i dont know anybody 
anymore who watches regular tv and doesnt have a lot of complaints 
about it saying i cant believe how bad it is its like 
everything gettings so moralistic and formulaic 
he acknowledged there are a lot of things in this special 
that people wont get but some people will get some things and 
some people will get other things the beauty is we dont have to 
worry about that 
back to brooklyn is presented with the same false 
seriousness that has become a trademark of many documentaries these 
days 
basically what the special is its me going back to brooklyn 
coming back in contact with my roots you know this kind of 
thing quinn says at the shows start my agent didnt want me 
to do it 
his fictional talent agent played by the shows director ben 
stiller is a misguided wheelerdealer whose clients include diver 
greg louganis actor kirk cameron and every notalent in between 
the agents ideas include a new movie based on batman and 
do the right thing the title do the robin thing where 
the boy wonder is stuck delivering pizzas 
i just want to do that stuff thats funny if i could just do 
a few more of these thatd be fine quinn said we hardly even 
made money on this but i didnt care i just want to do good 
stuff

in politics one of the safest popular 
commendable and perhaps rewarding stances is to be for the poor 
especially through government transfer programs 
politically speaking it is an assumption not to be questioned 
that transfers of money from the rich to the poor will over time 
improve chances of the poor obtaining a larger percentage of the 
nations income 
but it might not be so in that respect the safe popular and 
commendable political stance might also be one of the least 
effective says professor dwight lee in a paper for the center for 
the study of american business st louis 
lees position will create controversy but thats what every 
unpopular notion does in the world of economics it may be true 
also that he will never be able to prove the case but it certainly 
will get an airing 
indeed one reason why lee challenged the assumption was its 
casual acceptance not just by politicians and economists but by 
other segments of economic society and the general public and the 
cost of course was another reason 
lee who teaches at the university of georgia contends that if 
government transfer programs were helping the poor then income 
distribution would have become more equal as spending on poverty 
programs rose over the years 
it hasnt happened he says he refers to studies showing that 
income distribution has remained almost stable over the past four 
decades he cites one study of income between 1950 and 1970 that 
showed 
households in the lowest 20 percent of income distribution 
received 64 percent of the national net income in 1950 and 67 
percent in 1970 
households in the top 20 percent of income distribution 
received 399 percent of national net income in 1950 and 391 
percent in 1970 
that says lee is very little impact for the billions of 
dollars spent it is so little he maintains that you might also 
assume that to drastically reduce such spending might do little to 
worsen poverty 
how could this possibly be he believes the answer lies in the 
nature of politics and the marketplace 
poverty he says is thought to result from a marketplace driven 
by competition among selfseeking individuals who have little 
concern for broad social outcomes if so he says the same is true 
in politics 
is it not at least a plausible assumption he asks that 
people are as selfregarding in one setting as another 
the political process like the market process is driven by 
competition between individuals who are interested in promoting 
their private objectives he says some of those objectives it 
seems dont always help the poor 
even altruistic people lee claims too often simply lobby for 
or against existing government programs that provide specific 
benefits rather than the objective of reducing overall poverty 
they might see no alternative 
sometimes the poverty advocates are made up of those whose 
employment is tied to programs leading him to point out that 
poverty professionals have an overriding interest in their 
incomes and job security and favor the continuation and expansion 
of funding for poverty programs for reasons completely divorced 
from any benefits the poor receive 
in short as lee sees it the motivation in politics is the same 
as in the marketplace if elimination of poverty is the goal few 
seem interested in determining whether programs do indeed work to 
reduce poverty 
why dont the poor themselves have more input for one thing 
the group is always changing relatively few households remain in 
poverty for a decade or so as a political constituency poverty 
lacks permanency 
the very small percentage of permanently poor he says often 
are incapable of being competitive politically and for the same 
reasons they arent competitive economically they dont have the 
skills he says

another kind of combat kite fighting 
draws hundreds of afghans to the fields on the edge of kabul on 
friday afternoons 
they call it the game and some bet the equivalent of 10 
the monthly wage of a starting government employee on the outcome 
kites fly over kabul all the time especially in the strong 
winds that follow a rainstorm they are the favorite of most 
children because other toys are too expensive and kites are cheap 
all it takes to make a kite are some bright paper bamboo sticks 
and string usually costing a dollar or two those who cant afford 
the favored paper from germany make do with plastic bags 
school children invented kites said mohammid nabi delaghah 
43 one of the kite sellers around the shor bazaar who promote the 
idea that afghan children were the first to make kites 
told that other accounts have it that kites originated in china 
around the time the great wall was being built he concedes that 
maybe afghans only invented fighting with them 
two people with kites had a war 90 years ago said delaghah 
a guy named osman bijo got a medal after he won the fight 
the rules for the game call for the competing kites to be 
the same size with string from the same country supposedly to 
assure that both will be of the same strength but the specialists 
say the real strength comes in the amount of crushed glass that is 
glued onto the string too much makes it inflexible not enough 
makes it weak 
its my specialty but i wont show anybody how to make good 
line said khan shareen a recognized expert on the string 
when the kites get 900 to 1200 feet up the battle starts with 
a nod or a shout between the duelers men usually in their 30s and 
40s 
a cry goes up from the spectators theyre fighting theyre 
fighting 
a fight takes about 15 minutes 
qari gholam samih 35 said he has not lost a kite in two years 
of fighting he said he spent five years just getting ready 
the trick he said is to be brave to have no fear 
the real war occasionally intercedes last winter a helicopter 
came roaring over the field and took down about 50 kites 
kites are even part of afghan literature a famous short story 
word of honor by akram osman made into a movie centers around 
a kite maker from the shor bazaar who wants to marry his cousin 
it wouldve been wonderful if the kites had eyes like yours 
the kite maker says in the opening scene 
the cousins father however opposes the union keeping his 
daughter at home and even changing houses when the kite maker 
successfully lands a kite that says happy holidays into their 
courtyard 
then the story takes a certain afghan twist the kite maker 
takes up body building and beats the womans brother at wrestling 
only then is he allowed to marry the cousin

nearly two centuries after napoleons 
forces routed them the knights of malta are returning to the 
island they got from an emperor in exchange for a falcon and ruled 
for 268 years 
the monks in armor will be here oct 1722 for a gathering 
their leadership hopes will help bolster maltas economy 
officially named the sovereign military order of the hospital of 
st john of jerusalem of rhodes and of malta the knights are the 
oldest order of chivalry and the fourth oldest religious order in 
the roman catholic church 
they ruled this rocky and almost barren mediterranean 
archipelago from 1530 when emperor charles v gave it to them for 
the price of one trained falcon a year until 1798 when napoleon 
sent them packing without the treasures they acquired during 
centuries of plundering the ottoman empire 
fra andrew bertie the 78th grand master of the 900yearold 
order has summoned the knights back and has urged them to help 
malta improve its economy 
for centuries membership in the knights required proof of 
generations of nobility although some ranks today are open to 
those without noble ancestry the rolls are still crowded with the 
wealthy and influential 
the new york financier j peter grace is a member as are former 
us secretary of state alexander m haig premier giulio andreotti 
and president francesco cossiga of italy and giovanni agnelli 
chairman of the italian automobile company fiat edward bennett 
williams the washington attorney and owner of the baltimore 
orioles major league baseball team who died in august 1988 also 
was a member 
such men are one reason the orders maltese association asked 
bertie to call the knights back to malta which in 25 years of 
independence from britain has found the economic road as rocky as 
its coastline 
bertie a longtime former resident of malta encourged knights 
worldwide to attend the first world gathering of the order and 
openly solicited their help 
i also urge those of you who are directly or indirectly 
interested in facilitating contacts with the development of the 
economic life of the island to do so bertie told the knights 
earlier this year in new york 
roger de giorgio president of the maltese association of the 
ancient order now based in rome said about 500 of the 10000 
members are expected to travel to malta 
we want knights from around the world to exchange ideas about 
our hospital work and to rediscover malta said de giorgio 
during the 268 years the knights were here they introduced new 
thinking in architecture law medicine and merchant shipping 
the knights made malta a thriving center of christianity and 
trade de giorgio said the knights also gave malta the legal codes 
that are the basis for much of its modern law in 1575 they built 
and then operated what then was one of the largest hospitals in 
europe they gave malta an architectural heritage of massive 
fortifications and magnificent palaces and churches 
the knights today operate about 200 hospitals and first aid 
centers in 90 countries especially in the third world and war 
zones 
the order was founded in the late 11th century with the opening 
of a hospice for pilgrims in jerusalem its centuriesold 
dedication to hospital work began when it treated the sick and 
wounded after the army of the first crusade captured jerusalem in 
1099 
it first took up arms in the 12th century to defend the pilgrim 
routes to the holy land 
in the late 13th century after the holy land fell to the 
moslems the knights moved first to cyrpus and then to rhodes where 
they built a navy to fight the moslem ottoman empire 
sultan suleiman the magnificent defeated the knights and forced 
them to leave rhodes on jan 1 1523 although with huge losses to 
his troops 
seven years later the knights resumed the fight from malta 
once again suleiman attacked this time 600 knights 1230 mostly 
spanish soldiers and about 6000 maltese militia defeated an 
ottoman army of 40000 that victory in 1565 marked the beginning 
of the end for ottoman seapower and earned the knights the 
gratitude of a threatened europe

more than two centuries 
after their expulsion by the spanish crown jesuit priests are back 
in this tropical outpost to champion the rights of indians and a 
shrinking wilderness 
i always try to think in terms of how the jesuits of 200 years 
ago would have handled a problem said the rev enrique jordan 
arias a leader in the local indians battle with timber companies 
exploiting the mahogany forests 
we try to follow that jesuit heritage in our fight with the 
woodcutters he told a visiting associated press reporter san 
ignacio is where the jesuit tradition is best preserved and where 
it is replanted in terms of modern problems 
san ignacio de moxos on the vast eastern bolivian savannah 
called the beni was founded by jesuits in 1689 as part of the 
religious orders missionary penetration of south americas 
heartland during spains colonial period 
at the mission the jesuits brought 14 indian communities 
together in a communal society and taught them weaving carpentry 
cermanics music and agriculture they introduced cattle ranching 
and coffee and peanut farming 
one jesuit priest francisco eder described the indians life 
in an 18th century book as one of peace and tranquility with an 
abundance of food and clothing 
in 1768 the missionaries were forced to abandon san ignacio de 
moxos expelled with all members of their order across south 
america by a spanish crown that considered their motives and 
technique subversive 
the outpost survived but even now with 6000 inhabitants it 
remains remote a dirt road winds northeastward for 270 miles to 
the capital city of la paz high in the andes mountains it is 
impassable in the rainy season and always treacherous 
this town has become a crossroads for lumbermen merchants 
cocaine traffickers and ranchers jordan arias 50 said 
his order returned to san ignacio de moxos in 1982 with three 
priests they function from a whitewashed church with elaborately 
carved altars and furniture painted red yellow and purple all 
dating back to the jesuits original stay 
they also observe some of the founding traditions including the 
annual procession in which a statue of san ignacio the towns 
patron saint is carried around the square by the priests town 
officials prominent citizens and indians of the local moxo tribe 
some indians wear feather headdresses wooden masks or other 
colorful costumes and march to the accompaniment of long bamboo 
woodwinds playing a music taught to their ancestors by the 
original jesuits 
when the ceremony ends the europeandescended townspeople and 
the indian descendants go their separate ways this unofficial but 
deeply entrenched racial discrimination is as abominable to the 
jesuits now as it was in the 1600s when they were sharply critical 
of the spaniards treatment of indians 
there are two worlds in this town jordan arias said they 
go to school together but then the whites go to their social club 
and the indians go to their social and spiritual center 
one notices a great deal of discrimination and hostility 
between the white and indian communities he said many indians 
are used as poorly paid laborers by white landowners and merchants 
the church has published books and pamphlets detailing the rich 
cultural heritage of the moxo indians and recently helped organize 
a national conference on tropical forests and indian rights that 
attracted hundreds of delegates here 
the legacy of the jesuits is a better civilization and for 
people to care for each other as brothers said antonio coseruna 
the 36yearold president of the moxo indian council 
the jesuits are now teaching us how to defend our rights and 
to demand better pay he said the white men dont like the 
jesuits because before it was easy for the white men to cheat 
us 
the government has given seven timber companies rights to the 
vast forests around san ignacio but in response to a 
jesuitsponsored public campaign it now is considering a law that 
would declare part of the wilderness an indian reservation and 
regulate the harvest of mahogany and other valuable hardwoods 
for years standard practice has been to remove worthwhile 
timber then let settlers burn off the rest of the forest for 
farming which quickly exhausted the thin layer of topsoil left 
behind are huge tracts of worthless barren land 
in 10 years there will be no forests and animals left 
coseruna said 
not all whites resent the return of the jesuits they get high 
praise from ana maria ruiz de antelo 30 president of the town 
council and member of a prominent cattleranching family who has 
worked to revive the indian tradition in handicrafts that 
languished after the jesuits were ousted 
the jesuits she said have returned to awaken and defend 
indigenous people because they have nobody else to protect them

amid the morning rush of commuters the white 
ford taurus blended well with the hundreds of other cars on 
washingtons trafficclogged sixlane beltway 
but as the sedan passed an 18wheeler at 60 miles an hour the 
driver flicked a switch just below the dashboard and the taurus 
became like no other car on the busy highway 
it was now running on propane instead of gasoline 
as congress moves toward enacting tougher laws to combat urban 
pollution and other environmental concerns including global 
warming the word is out the 1990s may well become the decade in 
which the alternativefuel automobile with its fewer pollutants 
will challenges the conventional gasolinepowered car 
president bush has proposed legislation calling for a phasein 
of thousands of alternativefuel vehicles beginning in 1995 and for 
production of at least 1 million such cars a year by 1997 in urban 
areas with the worst smog 
william reilly head of the environmental protection agency 
says there is no other way to attain a significant reduction in 
urban smog and still acknowledge americans love of their 
automobiles than to phase in large numbers of cars that use cleaner 
fuels than gasoline 
as a result there has been a rush to washington by almost every 
conceivable maker and promoter of alternative fuels in an attempt 
to carve out a niche in that yettobedefined future market of 
motor vehicles 
the parking lots on capital hill were dotted one day recently 
with vehicles powered by various fuels from propane to hydrogen 
among then were 
a transit bus with a specially designed engine powered by 
natural gas 
a mercedesbenz sedan powered by an experimental solarhydrogen 
system 
vehicles from beer and pizza trucks to midsize sedans all 
fueled by propane 
the propanepowered sedans including the white taurus were 
equipped with duelfuel systems that allowed with a touch of a 
switch to shift from unleaded gasoline to propane even at highway 
speeds with hardly a notice 
but the alternative fuel most talked about for passenger cars 
and cited specifically by bush is methanol a liquid that comes 
from methane the main component of natural gas methanol is in 
large supply requires no pressurization and could be dispensed 
from service station pumps alongside those offering gasoline 
methanol has been so widely discussed that producers of other 
alternative fuels have sent their representatives to capitol hill 
to complain that it is the only substitute fuel the epa and the 
white house are interested in 
what were striving for with the epa and the legislative 
lobbying is a level playing field said bob meyers executive 
vice president for marketing at petrolane inc the countrys 
largest retailer of propane he said there is clear evidence of a 
bias toward methanol in washington 
top epa officials do tilt toward methanol and white house 
counsel c boyden gray has made no secret of his views on the fuel 
he has been driving a chevrolet citation that runs on alcohol for 
several years 
many people have portrayed the administration as being 
dominated by methanol junkies patrick quinn the epas director 
of congressional liaison told a propane industry group insisting 
that such a characterization is not true 
in an interview quinn acknowleged that methanol appears to be a 
fuel of choice as an alternative to gasoline for most passenger 
cars but he said the agency plans to establish pollution standards 
for other fuels as well and envisions both propane and compressed 
natural gas as eventually gaining significant niches especially in 
such areas as fleet vehicles and transit buses 
there already are an estimated 350000 propanepowered vehicles 
in use nationwide almost exclusively in fleet operations 
among them are more than 250 taxis in las vegas 160 school 
buses in kansas city kan sheriffs department cars in sarasota 
fla and a variety of delivery trucks propane has been used in 
farm vehicles for years 
but propane still is primarily used for heating with only about 
3 percent of sales going to vehicles what we see now is a golden 
opportunity for expansion the niche we see is really in the 
fleet industry says jerry schmitt a marketing consultant for 
ferrellgas a major propane retailer 
but all this talk of substitute fuels for gasoline has not 
escaped notice of the petroleum industry 
atlantic richfield co recently announced it would begin 
offering a reformulated cleanerburning leaded gasoline for older 
cars other oil companies reportedly are developing cleanerburning 
unleaded gasoline and plan soon to put them in test markets in 
light of the expected tighter air pollution standards being debated 
in congress 
meanwhile the oil industry has unleashed a public relations 
assault on methanol including newspaper ads saying that it is 
highly toxic and even small amounts could be fatal if swallowed 
that it releases formaldehyde an ozonecausing and probably 
carcinogenic pollutant and that it would likely be more expensive 
than gasoline 
the epa responded with a report on methanol saying that the fuel 
remains a sound alternative that its expected price will be 
competitive with gasoline and that its safety risks are no greater 
than with other fuels including gasoline

good news for harried parents of toddlers the 1990 nissan 
axxess minivan is especially for you 
the axxess is the first small van with a sliding passenger door 
on each side of the vehicle and that makes it easy for parents to 
extricate little ones from the back seat 
forget about folding yourself in two and climbing inside to get 
at the kids with the axxess handy doors you can just reach in 
from either side imagine how this could cut down on wailing time 
and no need to worry about the young ones opening the doors as 
you drive both doors are fitted with childproof locks that allow 
opening only from the outside 
this vehicle also should appeal to buyers who want the 
versatility of a van and the safety of a car as nissan notes the 
axxess is the first minivan that meets safety standards for 
passenger carsvans are categorized as trucks under federal 
regulations and therefore need not meet the more rigid car safety 
guidelines 
the axxess however has 5mph bumpers a highmounted rear 
brake light sidedoor beams for protection in side crashes 
passive seatbelts up front and threepoint seat belts in back all 
standard equipment 
although available in frontdrive mode the nissan axxess offers 
even better traction with its allwheeldrive version which was 
the test vehicle in a sudden thunderstorm the axxess 
allwheeldrive offered surefooted control and peace of mind 
because of its size bigger than a sedan but smaller than other 
minivans the vehicle also maneuvered easily 
the allwheeldrive test model was powered by the standard 
24liter fourcylinder engine that produced 138 horsepower and 
was paired with a fourspeed automatic overdrive transmission 
the axxess wouldnt win acceleration derbies and i noticed a 
couple of jerks as i put it through some paces and the transmission 
sought the right gear but the fuel economy of 18 mpg in the city 
and 22 mpg on the highway is close to that of other 
twowheeldrive minivans 
for example mazdas mpv with automatic transmission is rated at 
19 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway while the plymouth 
voyager automatic with fourcylinder engine gets 21 mpg in the city 
and 23 mpg on the highway 
nissan expects axxess buyers to fit the young family profile 
the targeted median age for buyers is the mid30s and they are 
likely to have some college education with a household income of 
around 38000 they will be on a fairly tight budget said company 
spokesman ec mueller 
theyre not looking for something faddish they want quality 
and style he said nissan wanted to give them something thats 
comfortable fun to drive where you dont feel youre stuffed in a 
box 
thats why the axxess has so much glass the dashboard area is 
expansive and there are even tiny windows alongside the curving 
dash the sunroof on the test model added a feeling of space as 
did the headrests with holes cut in the middle i noted however 
that all that glass lets in a lot of sunlight and could quickly 
make for a hot interior on 90degree summer days thats where the 
air conditioning came in handy 
the test vehicle had seating for seven but rather than the 
typical minivan arrangement where two people sit in the middle and 
three in the back the axxess had a threepassenger seat in the 
middle and a twopassenger bench in back 
to reach the rearmost seat you must fold forward the seatback 
at one end of the middle seat then lift the entire folded middle 
seat forward against the front seat it took a little getting used 
to but worked well once i got the hang of it 
the rear door opened easily and offered access to a space behind 
the third seat big enough for several grocery bags to get more 
cargo room you must remove the rear seat headrests flip the seat 
cushion forward and the rear seatback down that too took a 
little practice 
minimum legroom for the rearmost seat made this position 
bestsuited for children the middle seat was better although the 
backs of the front seats still hit my legs if they were pushed all 
the way back and reclined a bit 
nissan expects us sales of about 18000 in the 1989 and 1990 
model years combined the axxess made its us debut in late march 
and sales through the first six months totaled more than 2000 the 
axxess has been sold as the prairie in japan since september 1988 
because the axxess is a new vehicle consumer reports magazine 
does not list an owners trouble report

harold clark simmons is a busy billionaire but he 
needs to be to reach his goal of leaving more money for medical 
research than howard hughes 
money brings a lot of responsibility as to what youre going 
to do with it and ive given quite a bit of thought to that 
simmons said in an interview during which he gave a rare insight 
into the thoughts and actions of one of the nations wealthiest 
investors 
basically my decisions have been largely to funnel most of the 
funds that i have available for discretionary giving to medical 
research said simmons who suffers from arthritis a painful 
inflammation of the joints 
last year he gave 41 million to the university of texas 
southwestern medical center in dallas for cancer and arthritis 
research and his goal is to at least match the howard hughes 
medical institute 
hughes the reclusive industrialist who died in 1976 had 
created the institute 23 years earlier and given it sole ownership 
of hughes aircraft co 
in the mid1980s the institute sold hughes aircraft to general 
motors corp for 52 billion today the institutes endowment is 
about 65 billion making it the nations largest private 
philanthropic foundation 
i wont cry if i dont make it or i wont boast if i get over 
that simmons said i think thats a nice round figure its 
realistic 
simmons 58 is well on his way increasing his wealth at an 
average of almost 14 million a month in the 12 years since he 
cashed the stock he received from selling his texas drug store 
chain to jack eckerd corp 
he began the chain with 5000 in cash and a 95000 loan to buy 
a drug store near southern methodist university through a series 
of acquisitions he built up to 100 stores before selling to eckerd 
for stock worth an estimated 50 million 
restrictions on that stock however prevented him from selling 
immediately the stock had declined to about 12 million before he 
could unload it 
with that 12 million the son of two rural texas school 
teachers has built a fortune bumping 2 billion through a 
combination of takeovers and stock plays involving some of 
americans biggest companies 
lately simmons has become a more public figure granting 
interviews and disputing his past image among some of his targets 
as a bad guy 
i dont think i have a black hat image he said i think 
that im certainly feared and dreaded and maybe not highly 
regarded by management of public companies that dont own very much 
stock in the company 
im not trying to change an image im just trying to make 
sure that the facts match the image the facts are basically that 
im a builder i have not dissembled any company nor split up any 
companies nor do i ever buy any companies with that intent 
while other highstakes investors are either dormant or prowling 
overseas simmons has at least two major plays under way he 
continues to buy stock in lockheed corp now holding more than 10 
percent and is awaiting georgia gulf corp managements response 
to his almost 10 percent stake in the company 
i think the thing that ive done well the thing that ive 
been able to make money on is simply evaluating the public 
information of public companies simmons said 
and based on that information ive made some decisions and 
taken some actions that have resulted in most of my wealth so i 
think thats what i have a talent for its a fairly narrow talent 
and youre not always right 
simmons claims to be lazy arriving at the office late and 
leaving early he also likes to play tennis ride dirt bikes and 
fly in his private jet although in person he displays none of that 
energy 
instead he barely moved during an interview at his north dallas 
office discussing in subdued tones his life as corporate takeover 
strategist and unabashed capitalist 
since 1977 simmons has bought and sold stock in 16 companies 
taking profits of 3289 million holding the stock from as short 
as a month to as long as three years 
his biggest absolute gain came in 1987 when he sold his 179 
percent stake in gaf corp for 1979 million three years after 
investing 58 million 
simmons denies he has ever been a greenmailer 
greenmail is when you threaten a company and you go sell your 
stock to the company so theyll get rid of you and nobody else gets 
to sell their stock simmons said whereas all stockholders 
benefit from his activity 
i definitely have a shareholders perspective simmons said 
im not doing that altruistically im doing that because its in 
my own self interest to do it i think thats good for my other 
shareholders because they go along with me if i do well for 
myself then they do well for themselves 
simmons also has kept a fair share of his holdings the most 
valuable stemming from his 1986 purchase of nl industries inc for 
about 300 million the investment now is worth an estimated 12 
billion 
another key play was the 1982 buyout of amalgamated sugar co in 
a 35 million deal he later sold an unprofitable joint venture for 
30 million giving him a total cost of about 5 million for the 
company he said he recently turned down more than 330 million in 
cash for the sugar beet processor 
simmons said his decisions to keep or sell and whether to take 
a company private or leave it public are based on money 
if i had all the money in the world i wouldnt have any 
public companies the minority interest in nl industries would cost 
about 650 million to 700 million so ive got to evaluate that 
alternative vs the alternative of just buying something else in 
this case my decision is to leave the minority interest in there 
let them be partners let them prosper if i do 
as for operating a company i very seldom buy take a major 
stock position in any company that i would not be willing to buy 
all that company at the price im paying for it simmons said 
many people think you just decide theres a company you want 
to buy period and you want to buy it regardless of what it costs 
i dont 
i want to buy a company if i can buy it for what i think is 
less than its worth to me he said 
if it gets higher than that ill sell

the typical top corporate executive is a 
conservative white protestant male with a traditional family 
life and a military background according to a nationwide survey 
the survey by the wall street journal also found that corporate 
leaders believe their business practices are more ethical now than 
a decade ago generally would hesitate to promote a homosexual to 
management level and believe its lonely at the top 
the survey looks at the personal lives and habits of 351 chief 
executive officers of the nations biggest companies and offers a 
profile of whos running corporate america detailed results will 
be published this month in the wall street journal book of chief 
executive style 
the typical profile of a successful chief is a conservative one 
according to the survey results were based partly on interviews 
with the chief executives by a team of journal reporters over the 
past year 
most of the nations corporate honchos have three children have 
been married to the same stayathome woman for 20 years and have 
served in the armed forces according to the survey one in four 
grew up in the midatlantic states of new york new jersey and 
pennsylvania 
theyre mostly college educated but only 35 percent have masters 
degrees and 125 percent earned doctorates generally at a 
nonivy league school about 5 percent have no degree at all like 
charles lazarus of toys r us inc howard sells of fw woolworth 
co or martin s davis of amerada hess corp 
the ceos usually work 10 to 12 hours a day plus weekends and 
take at least three weeks of vacation each year usually in 
florida only 28 percent of those surveyed took no vacation in 
1986 
an overwhelming majority 71 percent believe that in general 
ceos of major corporations are more ethical in their business 
practices today than they were 10 years ago 
reflecting their apparent conservatism some 66 percent said 
they would hesitate to promote a homosexual to managementcommittee 
level 
although the survey dealt with weighty questions such as ethics 
and minority promotions the journal book makes only a brief 
mention of those issues norm pearlstein editorinchief of the 
journal said those issues were not explored further because the 
thrust of the book was on ceo lifesytles and working habits 
despite their salaries and perks the executives say their 
everyday behavior in many areas tends to be similar to that of the 
average middleclass joe 
j richard munro of time inc commutes to work in manhattan 
every day on the crowded 602 am train out of new canaan conn 
an area where many ceos live to avoid the income taxes of 
neighboring new york he also speaks fondly of the pleasures 
derived from mowing his own lawn 
roger smith of general motors corp admits that he likes to eat 
fast food with the masses sure we go to mcdonalds i like 
mcdonalds hamburgers he says 
but socializing with subordinates is another story many said 
that after they made it to the top they felt limited in the number 
of personal relationships they could maintain preferring to 
socialize with other chief executives 
if youre socializing with one executive and not others 
youre sending messages to those you dont see that they should not 
be getting said duponts irving shapiro 
ceos tend to meet each other at private clubs where theyre 
likely to dine on seafood instead of red meat and drink as much 
wine as they do scotch about 92 percent of those surveyed said

international business machines corp has 
announced software for supercomputers based on a patented 
breakthrough by a mathematician at atampt bell laboratories 
atampt introduced its own package of hardware and software based 
on the socalled karmarkar algorithm last year and it appears that 
ibms entry tuesday puts the two technology giants in direct 
competition 
an ibm press release made no mention of atampt and simply said 
that part of its softwares power stems from a new programming 
method which drew worldwide attention when it was introduced a few 
years ago 
ibm spokesman denis arvay who mentioned the atampt connection 
said ibm was entitled to use the atampt patent through a 
crosslicensing agreement between the companies 
atampt spokesman bob ford said he could not find anyone at atampt 
who knew of the ibm product and thus the company had no comment on 
it 
the karmarkar algorithm invented in 1984 by atampts narendra 
karmarkar is a programming method for solving resourceallocation 
problems that involve huge numbers of variables such as scheduling 
daily crew assignments for a major airline 
ibm said its software was able to obtain the best solution to an 
airline scheduling problem in less time than a cray 2 supercomputer 
from cray research inc reportedly took to solve a problem 
onetenth the size 
ibms software known as the optimization subroutine library 
runs on big 3090 mainframe computers that have addon equipment to 
make them work as supercomputers but ibm said versions of it can 
run on smaller ibm computers even its personal computers 
the chief creators of ibms software were john tomlin of ibms 
almaden research center in san jose calif and john forrest of 
the thomas j watson research center in yorktown heights ny 
atampts hardwaresoftware product korbx was introduced in 
august 1988 at a price of 89 million so far there are two 
customers willing to have their names publicized the military 
airlift command and delta air lines inc

former secretary of state alexander haig and 
former house speaker tip oneill dont usually see eye to eye but 
they do agree on the benefits of flying the trump shuttle 
according to a new advertising campaign 
haig and oneill are one of several odd couples seated together 
in the television and newspaper ads for the northeast airline 
others include author norman mailer with boxing promoter don king 
and sex counselor dr ruth westheimer with fashion model carol alt 
the trump shuttle the ultimate connection is the theme of 
the campaign which starts wednesday in the shuttle cities of new 
york boston and washington 
each commercial focuses on an ironic juxtaposition said 
mark messing senior vice president at scali mccabe sloves the 
ad agency responsible for the campaign we chose personalities 
with little in common and asked them to engage in unscripted 
conversation 
in most areas ideology culture politics style they 
disagreed about everything with the one common ground being their 
choice of the trump shuttle 
trump shuttle which developer donald trump bought from 
strikebound eastern airlines in early june and renamed has been in 
a fierce battle for market share with the rival shuttle run by pan

international business machines corp says it 
will make available a program that checks for viruses in personal 
computers responding in part to customer worries about an 
impending attack 
news reports about the socalled datacrime virus which is 
programmed to attack after oct 12 have caused widespread alarm 
even though experts say the virus is rare and a relatively small 
number of personal computers will be harmed 
up until the recent press hype our customers had not 
expressed any tremendous interest over and above what we already do 
in terms of security products and awareness said art gilbert 
ibms manager of secure systems industry support 
small companies in the antivirus field expressed support for 
the step tuesday by the worlds largest computer maker 
its about time one of the big boys realized what a problem 
this is and did something about it to date all the antivirus 
activity is being done by the mom and pops out there said ross 
greenberg a new yorkbased consultant and author of flushot plus 
its a very important and responsible step said pamela 
kane president of panda systems in wilmington del and author of 
a new book virus protection 
ibm said its ibm virus scanning program for computers that run 
microsoft corps dos baselayer software would spot three strains 
of the datacrime virus as well as more common viruses that go by 
such names as the jerusalem lehigh bouncing ball cascade and 
brain 
the program is available for 35 directly from ibm or from 
dealers marketing representatives and remarketers gilbert said 
the program will detect but not eradicate viruses some other 
companies say they have products that will eradicate viruses 
although others say such programs are not reliable 
gilbert said installing a virus checker is not a substitute for 
safecomputing practices such as making backup copies of programs 
and data and being cautious about software of unknown origin 
the datacrime virus cripples personal computers hard disks 
where programs and data are stored by wiping out the directory 
sections known as the partition table and file allocation table 
experts who have dismantled copies of the virus say it is set up 
to attack computers when their internal calendars go past oct 12 
the traditional date for columbus day

timberland is drawing increased 
attention from investors who are rediscovering its value as a 
relatively lowrisk investment that provides a good hedge against 
inflation experts say 
there is a growing interest by nontraditional investors in 
timberlands pension funds and individuals who are looking at 
timber as another asset to diversify their portfolios said clark 
s binkley a professor at yale universitys forestry and business 
schools 
the conventional wisdom has been that timber stands are 
risky investments because of forest fires insect infestations and 
a volatile demand linked to fluctuations in the housing market 
binkley said but the reality is that you can store timber on the 
stump until demand goes up and only a miniscule percentage will be 
lost to fires and disease 
because timberland does not tend to fall prey to the same market 
forces as stocks and bonds binkley said it can be a useful tool 
in building a diversified portfolio investments in timber also can 
offer comparable rates of return to stocks and bonds with 
considerably less risk he said 
southern pine timberland for example has had an annual return 
of about 10 percent since 1955 
investors are being drawn to timberland because of the 
diversification and low risk coupled with what we consider very 
good returns said robert chambers the atlantabased vice 
president and manager of timberland for first wachovia investment 
management a division of the first wachovia bank 
chambers said that pension funds have invested 600 million to 
700 million in timberland 
while some pension funds like usx corps own thousands acres 
on their own most of these nontraditional investors join with 
other investors in timberland investment funds 
the largest fund is run by john hancock the bostonbased 
insurance and financial services company other insurance 
companies including mutual of new york also manage timber funds 
as does first wachovia bank which is based in winstonsalem nc 
first wachovia runs the countrys only openended fund which 
allows investors to increase or decrease the size of their 
investments and allows new investors to join each quarter 
other funds are closedended with participants investing a 
fixed amount and remaining committed to the fund until a preset 
maturation date 
first wachovias fund has seven investors and owns about 33000 
acres of forest in georgia florida and mississippi chambers said 
he said he expects substantial growth over the next three to 
five years for timberland funds as they become more accepted by 
pension fund managers 
binkley a forestry professor who also has an appointment at 
yales school of organization and management has been working to 
quantify the risks involved in timber investments 
we need to be able to explain timberland to potential 
investors in exactly the same terms as stocks bonds and other 
investments he said in a recent interview 
binkley said his research shows that maine timberland presents 
the least risk to investors while southern woodland is slightly 
more risky and timberland in the pacific northwest is the most 
risky 
investments in pacific northwest timberland seem to be the most 
volatile because of the federal governments controls on the sale 
of timber there congress sets sales levels for timber in the 
region every year so lumber prices are not simply a function of 
market forces binkley said 
binkley said however that as risk increases so does the 
potential for investment return 
im not saying that every individual or pension fund manager 
should rush to invest in timber i am trying to provide the tools 
they can use to assess whether the investment is right for them 
he said

troubled eastern airlines striving to rebuild 
as a smaller carrier has received permission to dip into 75 
million held in escrow and to sell a 30 million note that it owns 
at a hearing tuesday us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland 
granted easterns request to use the 75 million which came from 
asset sales to help run its operations through the end of the year 
miamibased eastern which was struck by its unions and filed 
for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early march is selling 
about 18 billion in jets routes and other assets 
in a separate action tuesday the senate voted to cut off debate 
on longstalled legislation that would require creation of a 
commission to investigate and recommend solutions to the eastern 
strike which has entered its eighth month 
david i shapiro the courtappointed bankruptcy examiner for 
eastern told lifland he supported easterns request for the funds 
on the grounds that it needed the cash to keep operating 
after the 75 million is withdrawn eastern will have about 300 
million left in escrow from which to repay its creditors or cover 
operating expenses 
the 75 million is necessary for and will be sufficient to 
support easterns fourthquarter operations said bruce zirinsky 
an attorney for the airline he reiterated the companys assertion 
that it is exceeding the financial projections made in an operating 
plan it released in april 
in july eastern asked for 100 million from the escrow account 
for running operations in the third quarter lifland agreed to the 
release of 75 million at that time 
lifland also ruled tuesday that eastern could sell an unsecured 
30 million note that it acquired in 1986 from sister carrier 
continental airlines the note was originally issued by nowdefunct 
people express airlines a nofrills carrier that was absorbed by 
continental 
the judge also postponed until dec 15 a hearing on the unions 
request for a special trustee to be appointed to run eastern in 
place of current management consideration of the request by the 
eastern pilots machinists union members and flight attendants has 
been put off several times by the judge 
shapiro requested that the trustee issue be postponed until he 
can finish an indepth financial investigation of eastern 
continental and their parent texas air corp shapiro said he and 
more than 20 associates are interviewing current and former 
officers of the companies union leaders and others 
the examiner told the judge he expected to complete the 
investigation by early december and said his schedule has been 
delayed several times by lawyers for the parties involved 
bruce simon an attorney for the pilots union which supports 
appointment of a trustee said there was informal talk that the 
investigation could take until next spring 
joel zweibel a lawyer representing the committee of easterns 
major creditors said that group did not believe a trustee should 
be named at this time 
also tuesday moodys investors service inc said it had lowered 
its credit ratings on securities issued by texas air and 
continental reflecting the high leverage weak debt protection 
and decreasing financial flexibility of the parent and its 
subsidiaries 
the creditrating agency said texas airs ability to support 
continental has been diminished by the bankruptcy of eastern its 
other main subsidiary

as the 1990 model year debuts automakers are 
predicting a smaller us car and truck market more players in it 
and the likelihood of more buyer incentives 
nearly 80 million vehicles have been sold during the last five 
model years in the united states or nearly one new car or truck 
for every three people in the country there has been some concern 
that the market has been saturated 
but demand that flagged during the 1989 model year which 
officially ended saturday may get a boost in the 1990 model year 
as the vehicles on the road get older and closer to tradein time 
a lot of pessimists love to make the statement that we seem to 
be selling cars at a pretty brisk clip for eight years now and who 
needs a new car said analyst charles brady of the new york 
investment firm oppenheimer amp co inc 
if we replace just one of three of the cars 10 years or older 
wed sell 10 million vehicles he said 
final sales figures due out today probably will show that just 
under 15 million cars and trucks were sold during the 1989 model 
year experts predict that figure wont be reached this model year 
bob thomas vice president and general manager of the nissan 
division of nissan motor corp in usa this week predicted 14 
million vehicles will be sold this year general motors corp is on 
the high side of 1990 predictions at about 15 million a slight 
change from the 1989 model year 
chrysler corp expects about 142 million vehicles will be sold 
in the 1990 model year while ford motor co has said the figure 
will be lower than the 148 million it believed were driven off 
dealership lots in the 1989 model year ford has declined to make a 
formal prediction for 1990 sales 
during the past year about two cars were sold for every truck 
and analysts predict that ratio will remain about the same or 
perhaps lean a little heavier toward trucks 
like nissan analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co in new 
york is forecasting 14 million cars and trucks will be sold in the 
1990 model year if incentives remain constant 
he said that without the rebates that stretched through much of 
1989 automakers would have sold 1 million fewer vehicles 
that would have been an 11 percent drop instead of a 5 percent 
drop he said referring to the 158 million vehicles sold during 
the 1988 model year the third best year in auto history 
as the size of the market shrinks the number of models offered 
continues to grow 
in the popular minivan segment gm is introducing a trio of 
models its first minivans with front wheel drive that chrysler 
admits will dent its dominance of that market chrysler is striking 
back in part with an upscale version of its vans 
on the luxury end of the car market japanese companies are 
introducing two new lines to the united states this model year 
nissans infiniti and toyotas lexus are marketing two cars 
each ranging in price from just over 20000 to nearly 40000 
jaguar of britain also is introducing a new car to the us market 
priced lower than its others at 39700 
on the lessexpensive end of the market gms chevrolet division 
is heavily promoting its geo line of three cars and a sportutility 
vehicle made either entirely or partly by japanese companies 
chryslers dated omnihorizon models will continue but with 
less marketing emphasis while ford will introduce its new 
generation of escorttracer cars in mid1990

rj reynolds tobacco co has settled a 
federal false advertising claim by agreeing not to misrepresent 
in future advertisements the results of a study that linked 
smoking and heart disease 
the federal trade commission was divided 31 over accepting the 
settlement which was termed conspicuously weak by the 
dissenter commissioner mary l azcuenaga 
she said the acceptance demonstrates a modicum of interest at 
most in important issues related to smoking and health and 
indicates a double standard for deceptive advertising and lenient 
treatment for reynolds 
commissioner andrew j strenio jr defended the agreement 
calling it both justified and commensurately strong he said it 
provides appropriate disincentives against recurrence of the 
allegedly unfair and deceptive claims 
in a statement the tobacco firm said tuesday it remains 
convinced its advertising message constituted an exercise of free 
speech but that it felt there was no purpose in continuing its 
fight with the ftc 
we have decided therefore to accept a settlement that puts the 
matter behind the company rj reynolds said 
the ftc complained that a reynolds advertisement made false and 
misleading claims about a longterm study funded by the national 
institutes of health 
reynolds advertisement falsely claimed that the study 
provided scientific evidence that smoking is not as hazardous as 
the public has been led to believe the ftc complaint said also 
said the ftc the ad falsely maintained that the study tends to 
refute the theory that smoking causes heart disease 
the consent agreement is not an admission that the law was 
violated and it can become final after more commission debate 
after a 60day comment period by the public 
commission chairman janet d steiger did not vote on the order

two texans credited with revolutionizing 
electronics with their coinvention of the semiconductor microchip 
were named the first winners of the charles stark draper prize the 
worlds largest award given exclusively for engineering achievement 
jack s kilby chief technical officer of the houston area 
research center and robert n noyce president of sematech in 
austin will share a 350000 cash award and each will receive a 
gold medal officials announced tuesday 
the draper prize awarded for the first time this year is 
directed by the national academy of engineering a private 
organization affiliated with the national academy of sciences the 
prize will be awarded every two years 
we believe that the draper prize will focus world attention on 
the important contributions of engineers in the same way that the 
nobel prize now focuses attention on the accomplishemnts of 
scientists said robert m white president of the national 
academy of engineering 
white said kilby and noyce are credited with the independent 
coinvention of the single crystal microchip the microchip has led 
to a revolution in electronics and has become a vital component in 
machines used in communications manufacturing transportation and 
computing 
very few things have changed the world as dramatically as the 
integrated circuit white said like the invention of the 
telephone the light bulb or the automobile the creation and 
widespread practical application of the integrated circuit has 
fundamentally changed our lives 
the microchip is used in electronic circuits that are at the 
heart of such equipment as calculators digital watches 
telephones automatic cameras personal computers compact discs 
and in the electronics of satellites airplanes and military 
weapons 
before the microchip was invented in the 1950s electronic 
circuits depended on transistors resistors and capacitors that had 
to be soldered and wired together to create a desired function 
microchips however are made from a single silicon crystal and the 
functions of thousands of electronic components can be built into a 
chip about the size of a matchhead 
noyce 62 is president and chief executive officer of sematech 
a consortium conducting fundamental research in electronics and 
computers 
kilby 66 joined texas instruments in 1958 where he conducted 
the research that led to his coinvention of the microchip he is 
now an independent consultant in dallas and chief technical officer 
for the houston area research center a technology development 
concern 
charles stark draper for whom the engineering prize is named 
was the inventor of inertial navigation a guidance system that 
helped apollo astronauts navigate to the moon

the food and drug administration says its 
ongoing review of the 30 topselling generic drugs has resulted so 
far in the recall of one drug 
pharmaceutical basics inc of denver recalled its antifungal 
nystatin tablets because they were found to be below potency the 
fda said tuesday 
five other companies have recalled drugs since the fda began 
investigating allegations of fraud and corruption within its 
generic drug division and among some generic drug makers none of 
the recalled has posed a major safety problem the fda said 
the fda said the sept 27 recall by pharmaceutical basics was 
the first recall stemming from the testing it did not say 
whether further recalls would be required 
the fda said it has analyzed 1827 samples of the 30 leading 
generics for potency dissolution composition and other 
specifications and nearly all were found to be within acceptable 
specifications about 16 percent of the samples were found to be 
deficient in potency or dissolution which the fda said is about 
the rate it usually finds under normal industry conditions 
the agency said it has more testing to do and its findings are 
to be released at the end of the month

the senate finance committee early wednesday 
defeated a proposed cut in the capitalgains tax and on a tie vote 
approved a substitute savingincentive plan that would allow all 
workers to have taxdeductible individual retirement accounts 
nearing final action on a bill whose main purpose is to cut the 
federal deficit by about 8 billion in the fiscal year that began 
sunday the committee formally approved a 63 percent increase in 
the amount older americans may earn without losing any of their 
social security benefits 
the 1billionayear change would benefit only the most 
affluent 10 percent of social security beneficiaries 
on a 1010 vote nearly along party lines the committee retained 
a proposal in the bill by chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas to 
liberalize iras the same vote rejected a cut in capitalgains tax 
offered by sen bob packwood rore along lines recommended by 
president bush only sen david boren dokla broke party ranks 
siding with the gop proposal 
packwoods amendment also included some ira provisions allowing 
workers to contribute to an account without any immediate tax 
deduction but exempting interest from ever being taxed 
bentsen said that would simply shift the costs of iras to a 
future generation he portrayed his own plan as superior to 
packwoods and to a different capitalgains reduction approved by 
the house 
republicans made clear they will renew the capitalgains fight 
on the senate floor as early as this week 
most of the spending cuts in the bill would affect medicare 
reimbursements to hospitals and doctors one provision would save 
money by overhauling the fee schedule for reimbursing doctors 
basing fees on the time training and skill required to provide a 
particular service 
also added to the bill over objections of the bush 
administration was a provision removing the social security 
administration from the department of health and human services and 
creating it as an indepenent agency a similar change is awaiting 
final action in the house 
the change in the social security earnings limitation which the 
panel had tentatively approved monday would benefit only the most 
affluent retirees between ages 65 and 69 those who earn more than 
8880 a year in retirement that would be about one of every 10 
social security beneficiaries in that age group 
the committee agreed without discussion or dissent to boost the 
limit to 11700 next year and then to 14520 on the next 5000 
of earnings to a total of 19520 the social security recipient 
would give up 1 in benefits for each 4 earned 
once earnings pass 19520 the penalty would be 1 for each 3 
earned above the limit 
present law requires a retiree between the ages of 65 and 69 to 
give up 1 in social security pension for each 2 earned above the 
8880 earnings limit the penalty is scheduled to drop next year 
to 1 for each 3 earned above the limit 
a separate 6480 limit affecting beneficiaries under age 65 
would not be changed by the committees proposal those 70 or older 
could continue to earn an unlimited amount without penalty 
the house has agreed to a more modest increase in the 6569 
earnings limit to 9720 next year and 10440 in 1991 
the finance committee voted to pay for the increase by requiring 
that deferred compensation such as earnings set aside in a 401k 
retirement plan be included in the formula that determines 
average total wages for social security purposes 
the shortrun effect is to increase the amount of wages subject 
to social security taxes in the long run the change would cost 
the government more than it brings in by forcing up social 
security benefits 
the committee added to the bill a requirement that starting in 
1995 the government each year send a statement of social security 
benefits earned sto every person 60 and older starting in 1999 
statements would have to be mailed to every worker

after pounding for three months on lin 
broadcasting corps front door mccaw cellular communications inc 
is trying a side entrance in its takeover attempt 
mccaw said tuesday it would acquire a halfinterest in a new 
york city cellular franchise whose other half is owned by lin 
broadcasting 
at the same time mccaw said it would sell its interests in 13 
mobiletelephone franchises in alabama kentucky and tennessee to 
contel cellular inc 
mccaw the nations largest cellular telephone company said in 
a statement that the new york deal involves an agreement to pay 
19 billion in cash for metromedia cos onehalf interest in 
metro one one of two new york cellular franchises lin which owns 
the other half would have a 45day right of first refusal to the 
deal 
the metromedia deal would give mccaw a 50 percent voting 
interest and 4567 percent equity interest in the new york 
franchise 
lin holds a 50 percent voting interest and 45 percent equity 
interest in the franchise which would be controlled entirely by 
mccaw if its proposed acquisition of lin goes through 
its a pretty savvy move by mccaw said john reddan a stock 
analyst for moran amp associates in new york mccaw is basically 
challenging lin to either put up or shut up in new york 
the most immediate question for lin officials would be whether 
they wanted to borrow 19 billion to buy out metro one taking on 
the additional debt could make lin less attractive in its own 
efforts to merge with bellsouth corp in a 5050 partnership 
analysts said 
in june mccaw offered to buy lin for 585 billion lin 
rejected that offer but mccaw persisted and dropped its offer 
from 127 per share to 110 per share after a court decision in 
july against lin which had claimed it owned key cellular franchise 
rights in philadelphia and new york ciy 
the 110ashare offer for approximately 53 million lin shares 
has been extended to oct 13 despite lins september announcement 
that it intended to merge with bellsouth 
mccaw lins largest shareholder with a 10 percent stake has 
been tendered more than 8 million lin shares said tom campo at 
adams amp rinehart inc a new york public relations agency 
representing mccaw 
the contel agreement would provide mccaw about 13 billion in 
cash or about 205 a pop an industry yardstick obtained by 
multiplying a market area population by the percentage ownership of 
cellular systems serving the market 
each market is allowed two cellular franchises one for the 
local telephone company and one for an independent operation like 
mccaw 
the contel agreement which is subject to closing price 
adjustments would make the contel corp subsidiary the nations 
seventhlargest cellular phone company gaining controlling 
cellular interests in 13 southeastern markets including louisville 
and lexington ky nashville memphis knoxville johnson city 
chattanooga and clarksville tenn and birmingham tuscaloosa 
florence anniston and gadsden ala 
the metromedia deal covers about 68 million pops and works out 
to about 275 a pop the contel deal is about 61 million pops 
atlantabased contel currently has about 144 million pops 
these are two more steps toward achieving our longstanding 
strategic objective of creating a national cellular network that 
will give american consumers an independent alternative to 
traditional providers of telephone service mccaw chairman craig 
o mccaw said 
he described contel as a fellow independent with whom we have 
had a long and mutually beneficial relationship 
mccaw based in this seattle suburb operates in 127 areas with 
a total of 50 million pops in 26 states including major regional

the union representing 57000 boeing co 
employees went on strike early wednesday in its first strike 
against the worlds largest aerospace company in 12 years 
machinist union members in seattle portland ore wichita 
kan and elsewhere began the walkout at 1201 am local time 
union officials said 
in seattle on tuesday the union overwhelmingly rejected what 
boeing said would be its final contract offer 
union leaders had said they would notify a federal mediator who 
joined negotiations last weekend that they would be willing to 
consider resuming negotiations 
but tom baker president of the machinists district lodge 751 
said the union would not be in favor of extending the midnight 
strike deadline 
boeing issued a statement several hours after the strike vote 
expressing disappointment but vowing to continue operations with 
supervisors and nonstriking workers 
our airline customers have been notified of a strike and our 
intention to support deliveries to the best of our ability 
boeing said it is impossible to make a general statement on all 
defense and space programs since they are at various stages of 
development and production 
union leaders said the members were unified and determined to 
get a better share of boeings recent success 
im pleased that the rank and file are as solid as they are 
and as united as they are on the issues said baker adding the 
union would take a dim view of extending the strike deadline 
baker said the main reason for the strike vote was a feeling 
that boeing workers deserved a greater share of the companys 
record prosperity 
we have gone through the hard times with this company we just 
want to go through the good times with them as well as the hard 
times baker said 
baker left a brief news conference with reporters to go to union 
headquarters where he said he would attend a briefing for picket 
captains 
the rejected offer for the machinists promised an immediate 
raise of 4 percent with 3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991 
the proposed threeyear contract also contained annual bonuses 
of 8 percent of a workers gross earnings this year and 3 percent 
the next insurance improvements and reduced compulsory overtime 
requirements 
workers filling more than half of the 65000seat kingdome 
jeered the proposed contract and folded summaries of it into paper 
airplanes which filled the air of the indoor stadium throughout a 
loud meeting 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we would certainly have to have more baker told reporters 
earlier as the machinists filed toward the podium to vote we 
have told the boeing co what it would take to settle the 
contract 
boeings stock rose 312 to 5975 a share in new york stock 
exchange trading tuesday apparently on expectations that the 
contract would be ratified 
boeing machinists voting in seattle wichita kan portland 
ore and elsewhere were asked to decide whether to accept the 
contract which required a simple majority and whether to strike 
which required approval by twothirds of those voting 
the union previously authorized a strike at midnight tuesday 
the same time its threeyear contract with boeing expires 
baker said he expected the eventual settlement to set a pattern 
for labor talks throughout the aerospace industry 
judith comeau an aerospace industry analyst for goldman sachs 
amp co in new york said a strike would not be a big issue 
provided it doesnt go much longer than two weeks 
financially the company is very strong with 32 billion in 
cash 5 billion in equity and 200 million in debts the impact of 
a strike probably wont even be measurable comeau said 
it wont make customers happy because theres already been 
some delays in deliveries especially 747s quite simply theyre 
just going to have to wait she said 
union leaders told the machinists who last struck boeing in 
1977 for two months the time was right to demand more 
if you arent tough enough to secure a decent contract this 
time youll never get one said justin ostro general union vice 
president and bargaining coordinator 
if you turn tail and run dont come back in three years 
expecting great change he added there is no good time to 
strike there is only the right time 
boeing the worlds largest commercial airplane builder is 
enjoying its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders with 
carriers and leasing companies ordering 736 planes worth 385 
billion so far this year 
though pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business boeing 
commercial airplanes has a backlog of nearly 1600 jets worth about 
70 billion and deliveries extending well into the mid1990s 
for 1988 profits were 614 million on 1696 billion in sales 
baker said a strike could last a week it could be months 
he said there was some division among boeing workers about the 
bonuses with veteran employees content to see all compensation in 
their paychecks and newer workers preferring the extra check at the 
end of the year 
the proposed contract also includes a costofliving adjustment 
that is 99 percent of actual inflation which is 17 cents per hour 
better than the present formula 
worldwide boeing employs 144725 people including 106000 in 
western washington

the fair trade commission has raided apple 
computers major authorized dealers to investigate allegations that 
they pressured magazines to drop advertisements for discount stores 
selling apple products officials said wednesday 
on tuesday the ftc raided almost 40 sites including seven 
offices of canon sales co inc and apple computer japan japanese 
headquarters of the californiabased apple computer inc said 
mitsuru suzuki an ftc investigator 
canon and apple computer denied the allegations 
an official at the ministry of international trade and industry 
speaking on condition of anonymity said the ftc could warn but 
not punish any companies found to have applied such pressure 
suzuki said one nonauthorized retailer of apple products had 
filed a complaint accusing canon and apple computer japan of 
pressuring some major computer magazines not to publish such 
retailers ads featuring discounted apple computers 
its sabotage to free business activities suzuki said 
and we suspect apple might have been cooperating in the action 
which prevents equal opportunity for other competitors 
among the popular apple products involved are desktop computers 
such as macintosh plus and macintosh se printers including image 
writer ii hard discs and external drives for added memory capacity 
akisuke fukutomi an executive of step one of about 10 
individual importers of macintosh computers told the associated 
press that he filed the complaint with the ftc 
our company is the victim he said 
he said mac life a major computer magazine published by 
kawade shobo and featuring apple products carried one 
advertisement by step in april but then stopped 
the magazines editor apologized explaining that canon and 
apple pressured the magazine he said 
the editor could not be reached for comment 
we should be given equal opportunity so that everybody can 
compete on the same ground fukutomi said 
we have no fancy showrooms nor do we have beautiful 
brochures but our low pricing is reasonable and whats wrong with 
that he said 
for example a 4megabite macintosh se with japanese language 
capability costs 6030 through any of the 20 authorized agents 
whereas step sells it for 4200 he said 
since june another major monthly magazine ascii has left 
blank spaces in steps ads where there used to be prices 
step also carries nec epson and toshiba computers fukutomi 
said adding that it sells some 110 macs a month 
canon sales co was the sole agent for apple computers in japan 
until apples subsidiary was establisheed in 1983 canon does not 
import apple computers but distributes 80 percent to 90 percent of 
apple computers in japan to about 240 retail stores said motoyuki 
fujimoto a canon spokesman 
we are innocent and there is no evidence to merit such 
suspicion he said 
takashi fujimura canons managing director said in a 
statement were in a position to help the ftc investigate as 
well as conducting our own investigation internally 
the ftc also accused apple computer japan of refusing to repair 
apple products brought in by customers who had bought them from 
nonauthorized retailers 
apple computer spokeswoman keiko fukushima said the company had 
no intention to prevent fair competition 
the reason we cannot fix the machines is that many of the 
computers purchased through nonauthorized dealers do not have 
serial numbers which is the most important identification of apple 
products for repair she said 
while some individual importers have been reported erasing 
serial numbers to avoid tracing and interference with their supply 
sources steps fukutomi said his stores has been using the serial 
numbers since sept 1 ending the repair problem

unisys corp said it hopes to see savings 
in the fourth quarter from a restructuring plan that will reduce 
the work force by 8000 and annual costs by more than 400 million 
the costcutting moves originally announced aug 18 and begun 
this week are designed to counter weak domestic demand for 
computers and defense electronics products and stiffer worldwide 
competition 
unisys said tuesday it plans to cut roughly 1000 more jobs than 
originally expected when it first announced the restructuring 
the austerity measures involve laying off 6300 people and 
eliminating 1700 positions through attrition and early retirement 
that will reduce the work force by nearly 10 percent to about 
80000 worldwide the company said 
w michael blumenthal unisys chairman and chief executive 
officer said the restructuring plan was the result of months of 
planning 
the actions being announced today will reduce our costs in 
1990 significantly and along with other planned improvements this 
will lead to a substantial lowering of our breakeven point he 
said tuesday 
by simplifying our organizational structure and shortening 
lines of communication we will be better able to meet our 
customers needs 
blumenthal said the cost of restructuring would be announced 
later this month with the thirdquarter financial results the 
company said it expects to take a substantial charge in the third 
quarter 
unisys has been losing ground in the mainframe and minicomputer 
markets lately in addition its big defense business has lagged 
partly due to slowing growth in the us defense budget and also 
because of a threemonth suspension in its dealings with the 
government tied to the companys involvement in the pentagon 
procurement scandal 
unisys is cutting jobs throughout the company including on the 
corporate level according to unisys spokesman j peter hynes 
this week the company plans to eliminate 3200 jobs at 250 
sites in the united states an additional 1200 jobs outside the 
united states will be cut by the first quarter of 1990 unisys the 
nations no 3 computer company will continue cutting 1900 jobs 
later this year and into 1990 
in addition to layoffs the plan involves eliminating overhead 
and consolidating administrative and technical support functions 
reducing manufacturing overseas and increasing the move toward 
inhouse production of the companys major microprocessor lines 
the company said it expects the program to lower the companys 
breakeven point by more than 15 billion meaning that if it were 
to break even on roughly 10 billion of sales it expects to post 
for this year it would be able to break even on 85 billion of 
sales in 1990 
last quarter the company reported a 67 percent decrease in 
earnings blaming a drop in inventory pricing pressure from 
competitors and a temporary suspension of pentagon work 
hynes said the companys consolidation plans include 
transferring the manufacture of computer mainframes from tredyffrin 
to clear lake iowa by mid1990 unisys will close its st 
laurent canada plant in 1990 and shift its engineering support to 
rancho bernardo calif 
most of the manufacturing at the unisys peripherals group in 
santa clara calif hardest hit with 350 job cuts will be 
consolidated into other facilities 
in addition hynes said unisys is implementing a new plan to 
strengthen its approach to selected markets and to reallocate 
support services the original plan was adopted in 1986 when sperry 
corp and burroughs corp merged

deregulation has hurt smaller independent 
airlines while favoring larger carriers a top executive of braniff 
inc told aviation executives as his cashstarved airline tries to 
rebuild as a smaller carrier 
tom volz braniffs senior vice president for marketing blamed 
the carriers troubles on the governments 1978 deregulation of the 
nations airline industry braniff based in orlando filed last 
week for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and protection from 
creditors its second such filing in seven years 
frequentflier tickets are a particular source of unfair 
competition volz told about 300 aviation executives attending the 
transport aircraft marketing symposium in orlando tuesday 
although he said he doesnt favor a return to tight regulation 
of the industry volz suggested that the government should consider 
ordering an end to frequentflier programs which he said allow 
unfair competition 
because of its smaller size braniffs frequentflier program 
was not started until after those of the larger airlines volz 
said and wasnt able to catch up 
volz said small airlines such as braniff also were damaged by 
travel agents he described as being locked in by the suppliers 
of their computerized reservation systems those systems he noted 
either are owned outright or jointly by the big airlines 
between 1978 and 1988 he said the number of us airlines 
dropped from 36 to 28 while the carriers combined profit fell to 
600 million from 1 billion and 200 airlines filed for bankruptcy 
or halted operations 
although braniff has run out of cash it hopes to remain aloft 
as a smaller airline with hubs in orlando and kansas city mo and 
reduced service to spoke cities volz said 
kansas city will remain the airlines primary hub because of its 
central location volz said and orlando will continue as a hub 
because it is one of the fastestgrowing areas in the nation 
passengers from feeder or spoke cities will be flown to the 
hubs to catch connecting flights 
a new braniff marketing program will start within two weeks 
emphasizing a smaller independent airline with a lower price 
range volz said well have to be a boutique airline offering 
more for less 
braniff resumed service this past weekend after halting nearly 
all flights last wednesday the day before its bankruptcy filing 
the airline announced tuesday that it operated all 46 scheduled 
departures in 11 cities nationwide 
braniff also said it will continue to offer 99 oneway bargain 
fares to all destinations through oct 31 the airline was 
booking up heavily under this deep discount offer volz said 
about 2000 employees out of braniffs prestrike workforce of 
4800 were on duty tuesday the companys orlando workforce dropped 
from 1000 to 275 
in 1982 braniff filed for bankruptcy reorganization in dallas 
where it was based at the time the airline emerged from chapter 11 
protection in 1986

takes said picket brian mctighe the attitude seems to be 
militant 
no new talks have been announced

in the midst of its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner 
orders 
we have gone through the hard times with this company said 
tom baker president of machinists district lodge 751 we just 
want to go through the good times with them as well as the hard 
times 
the machinists voted overwhelmingly tuesday to reject a

and machinetool maintenance

fleets and meet a surge in passenger traffic have ordered 736 
planes worth 385 billion so far this year though pentagon 
cutbacks have reduced military business boeings commercial 
division has a backlog of nearly 1600 jets worth about 70 
billion with deliveries extending into the mid1990s 
the backlog has caused embarrassing delays in deliveries of the 
new 747400 jumbo jet boeings first in two decades and forced 
workers to put in heavy overtime 
were working on airplanes said dave branson a worker 
outside the everett plant we shouldnt be working fatigued they 
push for quantity not quality 
boeing promised to meet delivery schedules to the best of our 
ability spokesman paul binder said the company was trying to 
find supervisors to work assembly lines and keep jets rolling out 
he said there were no plans to bring in outsiders 
this is a negotiating position binder said of the companys 
latest offer its not a takeitorleaveit he refused to 
comment further on the companys reaction to the walkout 
union spokesman jack daniels said it would take two to three 
weeks to shut down operations completely because supervisors could 
finish some nearly completed planes with parts on hand 
a shutdown could worsen the us trade deficit boeing is the 
countrys largest exporter 
baker said union members were determined to get a better share 
of boeings record prosperity the company earned 614 million last 
year on sales of 1696 billion boeing also holds 366 billion in 
cash and shortterm notes 
the companys threeyear offer included an immediate 4 percent 
raise with 3 percent raises in 1990 and 1991 plus annual bonuses 
of 8 percent of a workers gross earnings this year and 3 percent 
the next 
workers havent had an increase in base wages which determine 
pensions and other benefits for six years although boeing paid 
bonuses of 12 percent in 1986 and 5 percent in 1987 and 1988 
the proposal also would have reduced compulsory overtime from 
200 hours a quarter to 160 hours and boosted some benefits and the 
costofliving adjustment 
for the average machinist making 1339 per hour the offer 
would have given an additional 13800 in income over the next 
three years 
workers filling more than half of the 65000seat kingdome 
jeered the offer tuesday and folded summaries of it into paper 
airplanes that sailed down from the second and third tiers of the 
indoor stadium 
if you arent tough enough to secure a decent contract this 
time youll never get one justin ostro general union vice 
president and bargaining coordinator told the crowd 
worldwide boeing employs 144725 people including 106000 in 
western washington in addition to the seattle workers the 
machinists represent 12000 employees in wichita about 1700 
workers in portland ore and a few hundred others in california 
hawaii montana utah and some other states 
baker said 100 million is available in a strike fund from the 
parent union which has been on strike against eastern airlines 
since march strike pay is a flat 100 a week per union member he

in politics one of the safest popular 
commendable and perhaps rewarding stances is to be for the poor 
especially through government transfer programs 
tific director since 
1985 many of the things that we used to blame on age are 
indeed modifiable by lifestyle and probably add to the life 
expectancy and add to the quality of life of people 
the blsa a component of the national institute on aging in the 
national institutes of health was founded in 1958 by dr nathan w 
shock regarded as the founder of modern research on aging he 
started the first nih section on gerontology in 1941 at baltimore 
city hospital 
dr shock wanted to measure such things as the rate of 
aging said fozard as it turns out this hope sort of 
disintegrated and was replaced by a number of more specific 
questions 
blsa researchers have studied agings effects on more than 1800 
people who are given physical examinations tests are done each 
visit on all of the organ systems the condition of the blood 
muscles bones hearing and vision electrocardiograms and tests 
using radiation are given less frequently 
volunteers also are tested on their memory reasoning and 
problemsolving abilities intelligence and personality a history 
of each persons aging that is used in more than 50 studies under 
way as part of the overall project 
among the findings is that there is no single biological 
master clock which drives all of the physiological aging that we 
see fozard said 
volunteers pay their own way to baltimore and spend more than 
two days every 2 years undergoing as many as 103 medical and 
behavioral tests i know of no other study that makes that kind 
of demand he said we ask them for a lifetime of commitment 
and many agree to be autopsied after they die 
the study pays for lodging and meals while volunteers are here 
as well as for the tests which could total 4000 at a doctors 
office or hospital 
the volunteers range in age from 20 to 97 sixtyfive percent 
are men 70 percent are college educated and half of those have 
advanced degrees most are middle or uppermiddleclass and only 5 
percent are black 
in some of the studies the social class definitely makes a 
difference fozard said in that sense the study may not be as 
representative as one with a more varied sample but when you 
compare all types of biological results these things dont vary 
much on social class 
scientists who use data from the blsa say the racial and social 
structure of the study is one of its weaknesses 
in an ideal world wed have it truly representative of all 
groups in the united states said dr hugh taylor at the wilmer 
eye institute at johns hopkins hospital but you have to be 
realistic there is a variety of people there and everybody is 
going to die everybody gets old 
researchers say the studys history explains its sociological 
profile 
the first subject dr william wesley peter recruited 
participants from among family and friends a practice that 
continues among volunteers today 
the study has a waiting list of about 1000 people and 
researchers have not made an effort to broaden its base fozard 
said 
paul kirbys grandfather volunteered shortly after the study 
began since then kirby 40 of glenwood md his father brother 
and three sisters became involved his wife pamela and a sisters 
husband also have volunteered 
the involvement of nine members of a single family could help 
the blsa determine whether heredity determines aging kirby said 
if they can see a trend in different generations of a family 
they might find a genetic link 
that genetic link still has scientists baffled fozard said 
we are constantly looking for ways to measure to get a handle on 
the genetic component of aging we think there are only a few genes 
involved with aging but where they are and what they are is still 
a mystery 
kenneth j nicholson 86 of mesa ariz joined the study in 
1960 he recently completed his 13th checkup for the study which 
he said has made me more cognizant of aging and the aging 
population 
nicholson said he also has modified his diet and made other 
changes in his lifestyle as a result of information gleaned during 
his visit 
information on any medical problem detected is given to the 
volunteers and their family physicians are notified so treatment 
can be prescribed 
the longer i have cooperated the more they are providing 
information to us nicholson said they give me good advice and 
that is very helpful 
fifteen scientists work with the blsa fulltime fozard said as 
many as 10 other scientists collaborate periodically through 
agreements with universities around the country the study has an 
annual budget of about 3 million 
volunteers say the blsas impact on society is enormous 
the longer it can run the more value they will get out of 
it said nicholson i would certainly hate to see it stopped

the 50 billion congress earmarked two months 
ago to rescue failed savings institutions may not be enough 
federal deposit insurance corp chairman l william seidman said 
today 
it is possible that 50 billion will prove to be an 
insufficient amount to deal with potential failures seidman said 
in written testimony presented to the senate banking committee 
but it is really much too early to make a reliable new 
prediction of loss he added at the first hearing on the savings 
and loan bailout since congress passed the legislation aug 9 
also testifying were treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and housing secretary jack 
kemp who are members of the oversight board setting policy for the 
resolution trust corp created to close and sell failed thrifts 
seidman whose agency operates the rtc said the government has 
taken control of 283 failed sampls with 112 billion in assets of 
the 283 it has closed 24 small institutions and expects to sell 
five large institutions by next week 
through august 1992 thrift regulators may turn over another 300 
sampls to the rtc bringing the total failures to nearly 600 with 
combined assets exceeding 300 billion he said 
those projections raise questions about the adequacy of the 
50 billion in rtc funding seidman said 
his written comments throw the strongest doubt yet on whether 
one installment on the sampl bailout will be enough however in his 
oral presentation to the committee seidman changed his tone 
slightly saying at this point we have no basis with which to 
make a different estimate from the 50 billion one youve heard 
private analysts have been saying for months that 50 billion 
would amount only to a substantial down payment on resolving the 
sampl mess both brady and greenspan told the committee it is too 
soon to know if the 50 billion is enough 
i think it isnt the point maybe we need 52 maybe we need 
48 the point is weve taken a bonfire and tamped it down to the 
point where its embers brady said 
meanwhile both seidman and brady who heads a cabinetlevel 
oversight board setting policy for the rtc reassured lawmakers 
they are working to prevent any scandal in the sampl bailout 
let us assure you that the oversight board is as anxious as 
this committee to protect against conflicts of interest political 
favoritism and other improper actions by employees agents 
independent contractors and all others who perform services for 
both the oversight board and the rtc brady said 
members of congress alarmed by the scandal at the department of 
housing and urban development are trying to prevent similar abuses 
from developing at the rtc 
the potential problems at the rtc dwarf the substantial 
problems the housing secretary has thus far encountered at hud 
said sen donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the senate 
banking committee 
the rtc last week issued an interim ethics code governing the 
thousands of independent contractors it is expected to hire to 
manage the real estate and other assets it is inheriting from the 
thrifts 
so far the rtc has spent 20 billion 18 billion to close the 
24 small sampls 83 billion to handle five large institutions by 
next week and five smaller notyetcompleted deals 85 billion to 
replace highcost deposits and 14 billion as a reserve fund to 
handle liquidity problems at thrifts that have failed but are still 
open seidman said 
deputy treasury secretary john e robson said inability to close 
the five big cases by sept 30 the last day of fiscal 1989 means 
the reported federal budget deficit will be 8 billion higher in 
fiscal 1990 however he said that would not trigger automatic 
spending cuts under the grammrudman law the 1990 budget estimate 
taken for determining those cuts was made on aug 15 he said 
members of congress also are looking at the division of the 
rtcs management in which bradys board sets its policy and 
seidmans agency does the work 
no joint enterprise of any magnitude is without its healthy 
frictions and ours is no exception brady said but overall we 
have gotten off to an excellent start 
meanwhile the oversight board announced tuesday that it has 
appointed daniel p kearney a boston pension fund adviser and 
mortgagebacked securities expert as its chief staff officer with 
the title of president 
kearney replaces robson who was filling the oversight board 
post on an interim basis

farmers may be innovative in their crop and 
livestock management but many cling to the old shoebox method when 
it comes to bookkeeping an annual survey by the agriculture 
department has found 
fewer than 3 percent of us farmers use computers to keep 
financial records while 56 percent use general ledgers or 
notebooks about 16 percent use some kind of financial records 
workbook 
diane willimack of the departments national agricultural 
statistics service said that leaves 25 percent who use other 
methods of keeping records including 14 percent who use the 
proverbial shoebox or similar way of hanging onto receipts 
invoices and bills of sale 
although usda county agents and private farm management experts 
have preached for years about the business of farming and how 
accurate records should be kept relatively few of the nations 22 
million farms have entered the computer age 
statistician willimack based her study on her agencys annual 
farm costs and returns survey for calendar year 1987 
previously there had been little documentation of farmers 
actual recordkeeping practices although much has been written 
about how farmers should keep financial records for tax or 
management purposes she said 
willimacks study was reported in the current issue of farmline 
magazine 
some other findings 
fewer than 12 percent of farmers subscribe to financial 
recordkeeping services most of those used are provided by 
accountants 
computer usage is not uniform among farmers nearly 15 percent 
of large farms those with annual sales of at least 250000 used 
computers and nearly 40 percent of those used recordkeeping 
services 
use of farm record workbooks was most popular in the midwest 
with 20 percent to 30 percent of the farmers in the corn belt 
northern plains and lake regions using them the extension service 
accounted for about 25 percent of the workbooks and the farmers 
home administration 11 percent 
computer use was greatest in the pacific region where they 
were used on 46 percent of the farms 
this was probably due to the prominence of corporate farms 
and the larger size and greater complexity of farms in this area 
willimack said 
onethird of all corporations used a recordkeeping service 
possibly their own paid bookkeepers 
willimack said the consistency of general ledger use by 50 
percent to 60 percent of us farm operators seemed to suggest that 
records are kept primarily for tax purposes rather than as aids 
for making managerial decisions 
participants in government programs apparently keep more 
complete financial records than nonparticipants she said 
also willimack noted the use of more advanced recordkeeping by 
younger better educated farm and ranch operators indicates they 
adopt such practices as they gain the ability or perceive the need 
to use them 
it appears that farm operators are moving up the learning 
curve with regard to recordkeeping practices but there is still 
ample room for improvement she said

the agriculture department says the soviet 
union has bought 2 million metric tons of us corn the first for 
delivery in 198990 under a longterm supply agreement 
rumors had been circulating in the grain trade that the soviets 
were in the market for a large order of us corn the seventh year 
of the longterm agreement between the two countries began oct 1 
officials said us grain sales to moscow in 198889 the sixth 
year of the agreement were a record of more than 217 million tons 
including more than 163 million tons of corn and nearly 54 
million tons of wheat 
in addition 198889 sales included 442500 tons of soybeans 
135 million tons of soybean meal and 102 million tons of grain 
sorghums 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 2 million tons of 
corn would be about 788 million bushels 
the sales were made by unidentified private exporting companies 
which are required by law to report large sales to the department 
no selling prices or further details were released 
arthur k homann of the departments foreign agricultural 
service said it was the soviet unions largest single order of us 
corn in at least three years although there were several orders of 
more than 1 million each last year 
corn prices have been averaging about 222 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usdas fiveday average meaning that the 
latest sale could have a farm value of about 175 million 
the agreement was extended last year until dec 31 1990 
meanwhile the united states and the soviet union are preparing to 
begin preliminary talks in moscow on dec 4 for a new longterm 
agreement 
under the current agreement the soviets are committed to buy at 
least 9 million tons of grain annually including a minimum of 4 
million tons each of wheat and corn and 1 million tons that can be 
wheat corn soybeans and soybean meal or any combination of those 
commodities 
the pact also allows moscow to buy up to 3 million tons of 
additional wheat and corn annually without further discussions if 
more than 12 million tons are wanted however the united states 
must be consulted

anthony fat tony salerno and leona helmsley 
have more in common than a criminal record 
salerno was convicted under the criminal side of the racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act of running a 
godfatherstyle crime family the kind of target the rico law was 
written for 20 years ago 
after helmsley was found guilty of tax fraud the hotel queen 
was charged in a civil racketeering lawsuit with taking millions 
from her ailing husband the type of case rico opponents say the 
law wasnt necessarily intended for 
for the third time since 1986 congress is considering a reform 
of the civil racketeering law aimed at stripping provisions 
allowing triple damages and exempting the securities and 
commodities industries from its scope 
one of the most contentious issues in business and legal circles 
today the rico ruckus pits a coalition of big business labor and 
securities firms against consumer groups state prosecutors and 
securities regulators 
a wall street journal editorial called civil rico the most 
abusive legal invention since the alien and sedition laws 
opponents quote cases from a divorce to a dispute over a rabbi 
they say the law has been used to bludgeon large settlements from 
defendants backlogged federal dockets and slandered businesses 
you hate to tell your stockholders youre being sued in 
federal court as a racketeer said kim r pearson a washington 
lawyer representing the national association of manufacturers in a 
coalition demanding reform 
defenders say rico combats widespread business and securities 
fraud by providing a powerful economic deterrent they reject the 
argument it encourages frivolous lawsuits 
silly rico cases get thrown out by the courts said michael 
waldman director of the consumer group public citizens congress 
watch in washington the issue is money the issue is 
whitecollar crime 
they dont want to pay treble damages in the cases in which 
people are responsible added notre dame law professor g robert 
blakey who helped draft the original racketeering statute 
rico was enacted in 1970 to attack organized crime the civil 
side allows plaintiffs who show two racketeering acts in 10 years 
to sue for triple damages plus attorneys fees nothing limits its 
use to mobsters 
criminal rico has received big publicity partly because 
prosecutors have used it to attack financial crime defendants risk 
minimum 20year prison terms 25000 fines per count and 
forfeiture of assets before trial 
a jury recently convicted six defendants in the firstever use 
of rico against securities professionals the princetonnewport 
partners tax fraud case bond financier michael milken and dozens 
of chicago commodity traders also face racketeering charges 
rico reformers arent quibbling with these prosecutions theyre 
more concerned about its use in inheritance fights or squabbles 
between competitors for example 
civil rico has been badly abused said rep rick boucher 
dva sponsor of the house reform bill 
it was designed to provide a remedy for people who were 
victimized by organized crime activities he said it has been 
used however almost exclusively in the context of ordinary 
business disputes 
uncertainty over the law limited the number of civil 
racketeering suits to about 500 until the supreme court in 1985 
upheld the statute and cases multiplied 
the administrative office of us courts says 1049 civil rico 
lawsuits were filed from july 1 1988 to last june 30 about as 
many as in each of the previous two years still that represents 
less than onehalf of 1 percent of the total of 233293 civil cases 
federal statistics show that in the 198788 period the most 
recent available 132 cases were settled without trial since 1985 
experts say there have been only about 15 civil racketeering jury 
verdicts judges have dismissed the bulk of cases or ruled without 
a jury 
boucher claims the lure of triple damages makes civil rico 
irresistible to any plaintiff who can meet the requirements and 
that statecourt fraud cases wind up in federal court 
what that does is leverage very substantial settlements based 
on less than substantial allegations from a defendant who fears 
treble damages and also doesnt want to be branded a racketeer 
he said 
its difficult for rico reformers to identify settlements 
reached to avoid a trial or threat of huge awards most cases they 
cited during congressional hearings this year dealt with allegedly 
abusive filings that were dismissed 
in one an illinois rock concert promoter sued another over use 
of an arena others include a freelance reporter who sued abc 
television for failing to give him credit on a story 
landlordtenant disputes and allegations of fundraising 
irregularities in walter mondales presidential campaign 
pending civil cases include a 250 million class action suit and 
11 billion government suit against defunct lincoln savings and 
loan association a 1 billion bond issue fraud suit by the 
washington public power supply system against general electric co 
and suits charging abortion protesters in pennsylvania disrupted 
businesses and damaged property 
large settlements include 25 million paid by ashland oil co in 
a case brought by two former executives who claimed they were fired 
for protesting alleged bribes to foreign officials and a 15 
million settlement by the accounting firm laventhol amp horwath after 
it was convicted of aiding securities law violations by a financial 
promoter 
antirico forces maintain that state laws and regulatory 
guidelines already cover abuses and protect defrauded consumers 
the securities industry has had this unique case law that has 
developed over 50 years that has given these people means of 
recovery said donald crawford senior vice president of the 
securities industry association there is no need for rico 
congress watchs waldman countered there is a whitecollar 
crime wave going on in this country its hard to imagine how a 
lobbyist for wall street can say with a straight face that the 
existing laws are working well 
the reform battle aside both sides agree the law needs to 
better define racketeering 
its so vague that no one knows until after the fact what they 
are required to do to avoid violating the law said new york 
attorney jed rakoff who represents eastern airlines strikers suing 
management for racketeering 
the supreme court earlier this year practically invited a 
challenge to the law on grounds of vagueness in a speech chief 
justice william rehnquist criticized abusive filings and called for 
congressional action 
most of the civil suits filed under the statute have nothing 
to do with organized crime he said they are gardenvariety 
civil fraud cases of the type traditionally litigated in state 
courts 
i think the time has arrived for congress to enact amendments 
to civil rico to limit its scope to the sort of wrongs that are 
connected to organized crime or have some other reason for being 
in federal court

its been 40 years since kirk kerkorian 
refurbished a small twinengine airplane and began shuttling 
passengers between a los angeles suburb and the fledgling gaming 
resort of las vegas 
in the years since then the shy son of armenian immigrants has 
built a billiondollar business empire while forging grand designs 
in the desert 
now hes embarking on his grandest yet an entertainment theme 
park and his third shot at building the worlds largest hotel 
kerkorians announcement tuesday of plans to build the 700 
million project on the las vegas strip is a case of promises kept 
ill be back kerkot the eight largest hotels in the world three 
of them with the kerkorian imprint 
kerkorian said tuesday his mgm grand inc will build the hotel 
on a prime strip corner now occupied by the marina hotel and casino 
and the tropicana country club 
i used the word bullish many years ago in talking about las 
vegas kerkorian said im still bullish on the city 
the 115acre theme park still in its conceptual and design 
stage will be a family attraction aimed at drawing middleclass 
tourists when it opens sometime in late 1992 
mgm grand chairman fred benninger said his company is confident 
the park will cash in on the trend toward family tourism in a town 
once dominated by highrolling gamblers 
i remember the days when las vegas lived almost entirely on 
the high roller benninger said tuesday you cant do that 
anymore 
kerkorians company built the international hotel now the las 
vegas hilton and later built the mgm grand hotel now ballys 
the international had 1500 rooms when it opened in 1967 as the 
biggest resort in las vegas and the mgm surpassed that with 2100 
rooms when it was built in 1973 
the las vegas hilton now has 3174 rooms and is the worlds 
largest hotel that mark will be broken when the 4032room 
excalibur opens next june across the strip from kerkorians new 
site 
the hiltons sister property the flamingo hilton will have 
3600 rooms when an expansion is completed next year kerkorian 
once owned the flamingo as well and he owned the land on which 
caesars palace was built 
kerkorian is expected to spend about 250 million on the new 
hotel and 450 million on the theme park which will include 
facilities for film making

a spraypainted tin sign over aldo ranieris idle pumps hangs as 
an epitaph to a oncethriving business no gas 
ranieri is one of more than 20000 independent service station 
owners nationwide likely to go out of business because of new 
environmental safety rules concerning underground storage tanks 
the potential closures represent almost a fifth of all us 
gasoline retail outlets threatening to significantly narrow 
competition and raise prices particularly in rural areas 
federal officials say the rules are aimed at protecting the 
environment from underground leaks that could contaminate water 
supplies 
thats no consolation to people like ranieri who cannot afford 
the enormous cost of replacing and insuring his tanks help 
thats what i need help ranieri says 
after 25 years of pumping gasoline at the same location in an 
affluent westchester county suburb of new york ranieri says state 
officials forced him to stop selling gasoline four months ago when 
he refused to have his tanks tested at a cost of several thousand 
dollars 
he has since laid off all but two employees who continue to 
repair cars in the garage 
the federal regulations require service station owners to 
replace or upgrade underground tanks by 1998 before then they must 
test their tanks install leak detection devices and prove through 
pollution liability insurance or other means that they can pay 
damages if theres a leak 
oct 26 is the deadline for owners of between 100 and 999 tanks 
to have 1 million in insurance coverage to pay for possible leaks 
those who opt not to take the 1 million insurance generally 
must be able to show they have a minimum net worth of 10 million 
to cover the cost of cleaning a leak 
with annual premiums more than doubling from an average of 
25356 in 1986 to 66064 in 1989 industry officials say many 
station owners will not be able to comply by the deadline 
fiftyfive percent of the people who should have insurance by 
oct 26 wont and the situation is getting worse says phillip r 
chisholm executive vice president of the petroleum marketers 
association of america 
a joint survey by three trade associations representing us 
gasoline marketers the petroleum marketers the national 
association of convenience stores and the society of independent 
gasoline marketers found that about 37000 retailers with 100000 
tanks will likely miss the october deadline 
smaller owners like ranieri who own only a few tanks have 
until october 1990 to get coverage but they face a december 
deadline for testing tanks and installing leak detectors 
ranieri says he has asked texaco inc for help since he sells 
the companys brand under a franchise but has been turned down 
hes now seeking a buyer 
texaco concedes it has no program to help independent tank 
owners 
its their responsibility said texaco spokesman gary 
taylor he said texaco is considering assisting wholesalers with 
insurance costs 
the petroleum marketers association estimates that at least 
26250 of the nations 150000 gasoline stations could close over 
the next few years as a result of the environmental protection 
agency rules 
ranieri says his tanks are at least 30 years old and need 
replacing he estimates the cost could exceed 200000 including 
compliance with state regulations that require installation of 
antivapor safety nozzles 
im a little guy for me to survive i have to replace the 
tanks i dont have the money he says 
across the street at a mobil station business has picked up 
since ranieris pumps closed one recent weekday morning a stream 
of cars pulled in and out almost nonstop the few unwary motorists 
who drove into ranieris texaco glimpsed the sign then wheeled over 
to the mobil pumps 
theyre busy all the time ranieri says im too small to 
fight i cant fight the big guys 
owners of 1000 or more tanks such as mobil corp which 
operates the mobil station had to be in compliance by last 
january most large oil companies already are self insured 
since the rules went into effect last december all tank owners 
are required to start testing the estimated 2 million underground 
oil and gasoline tanks nationwide up to half are believed to 
contain hazardous contaminants such as lead 
nobody is questioning the need for this says ron brand 
director of epas underground storage tank program the issue is 
who pays not whether we need it 
older storage tanks are made of carbon steel which corrodes 
and have typical design lives of 1520 years products stored in 
leaky or corroding tanks seep into water and underground wells 
tanks installed since 1985 had to be constructed of protected 
steel fiberglass or a sturdy composite with noncorroding pipes 
jim mccormick director of epas policy and standards division 
for underground storage tanks says that leak damage often is 
underestimated 
theyre not love canals theyre much smaller but there are 
lots more of them mccormick says 
up to 30 percent of the tanks could be leaking although there 
is no reliable estimate of the extent of environmental harm 
mccormick says 
states such as california and florida which started testing 
earlier than others have found evidence of widespread leaks that 
range in size from trickles to thousands of gallons 
epa officials say they are trying to ease the burden of the new 
regulations by phasing in the rules and giving special 
consideration to problem cases 
one provision for example enables epa commissioner william k 
reilly to suspend enforcement of the insurance deadline for six 
months if coverage is not available brand says 
but tank owners should not depend on the provision brand says 
because we dont have evidence that its not available 
the petroleum marketers group has asked the epa to suspend the 
compliance date for one year arguing that many insurance companies 
remain reluctant to provide coverage before tanks are upgraded 
other insurers require 100000 deductibles chisholm says 
industry sources say that some banks also are reluctant to lend 
money for tank upgrades because they consider it a highrisk loan 
so many tank owners are in a catch 22 situation 
while some states are coming to the rescue by establishing trust 
funds to help owners upgrade tanks and cover the major portion of 
spills only a few have been approved by the epa so far 
the way i see it im out of business says ranieri

investor alfred a checchi says he wont get 
a new partner to make up the 225 million from klm royal dutch 
airlines that the federal government ruled out as part of the 
takeover of nwa inc by a checchiled group 
the transportation department last week gave checchi six months 
to cut klms investment to 175 million from 400 million which 
had been the largest equity contribution to the deal to buy nwa 
the parent of northwest airlines 
the department said it was worried that klm could control the 
airline even though it held only 5 percent of northwests shares 
in an interview with the los angeles times published wednesday 
checchi said im not entertaining the thought of taking on 
another partner that wouldnt make sense 
instead the los angeles financier said he plans to repay klm 
the 225 million from northwests cash flow or by issuing 
nonvoting preferred stock or possibly by letting employees buy 
into the company 
nwa already has reduced its takeoverrelated debt from 335 
billion to 31 billion said checchi 
the group led by checchi including klm and other investors 
bought nwa for 365 billion in june checchi replaced steven 
rothmeier as nwa chairman last week

offset buying linked to new export sales of us wheat and corn 
corn and soybean harvesting has advanced rapidly during the the

chicagobased market research firm 
the agriculture department confirmed sales of 475000 metric 
tons of us wheat to egypt at subsidized prices and 2 million 
metric tons of us corn to the soviet union

transportation secretary samuel skinner said 
wednesday he was not ushering in new reregulation of the airline 
industry with a consent order restricting a dutch airlines 
participation in the buyout of northwest airlines 
appearing before house and senate subcommittees looking into 
leveraged buyouts and foreign ownership in the airline industry 
skinner said his decision to restrict the buyout of northwest 
airlines by wings holdings inc in which klm royal dutch airlines 
has a major investment was based on existing law 
he defended the influx of foreign capital and the use of buyouts 
to recapitalize a company when the value of assets such as 
airplanes and various rights exceeds the value of company shares 
but when they turn to highly leveraged thats bad he said 
in a leveraged buyout the new owners pay for the company by 
borrowing against its assets to pay off the debt they often have 
to break up the company and sell off parts of it 
skinner said that in highly leveraged buyouts the debt service 
can detract from important investments in safety and an uptodate 
fleet 
two aviation subcommittees are discussing proposed legislation 
that would make it more difficult for airlines to be acquired 
through leveraged buyouts the senate version addresses foreign 
investments as well 
skinner although officially undecided on either house or senate 
proposal said he felt that the law already gives the department 
authority to act when it questions the fitness of the airline to 
operate as a result of a takeover 
although the northwest case would procedurally have been 
cleaner had it been done earlier with specific guidelines too 
many laws on the books make it easier for lawyers and entrepreneurs 
to find loopholes he said 
its more difficult to unwind a transaction that has already 
been put together than it is to be there from the beginning 
skinner said but he added that it is not our intention to 
reintroduce regulation 
he disagreed with a specific proposal in the house bill that 
would allow no buyout that raised the debtequity ratio beyond 11 
in takeovers saying the ratio had to be examined individually in 
each instance that ratio doesnt exist with airlines in operation 
foreign ownership of airlines is limited under the federal 
aviation act although the provisions of the klmnorthwestern deal 
did not meet the literal guidelines skinner said it was clear that 
foreign control was an issue 
on friday the department announced that the new partners in the 
deal would cut klms interest from 57 percent to 25 percent klm 
would keep a seat on the 12member board but would have to excuse 
itself from decisions involving competition also the partners 
agreed to eliminate a threemember advisory committee that klm 
would have controlled 
the 705 million leveraged buyout announced in june is the 
largest in the airline industry skinner said and proposed a 
fourfold increase in the companys longterm debt 
the foreign ownership provision is to protect the ability of 
civilian airlines to function in wartime emergencies such as the 
transport of troops it is important if not imperative that 
the foreign ownership rule be enforced because of that 
consideration he said 
skinner said he was particularly concerned about the idea of 
having a klm board member on the northwest board when the two 
airlines would be technically in competition

burroughs wellcome co has 
introduced its antiaids drug in a strawberryflavored syrup to 
help patients who have difficulty swallowing 
the syrup form of retrovir the brand name for azt is 
expected to be available in pharmacies within four to six weeks 
company officials say 
this new formulation should provide more flexibility in making 
dosage adjustments and be particularly useful to patients who have 
difficulty swallowing capsules for a variety of reasons including 
lesions in the throat and mouth said kathryn h pattishall 
project leader for retrovir at burroughs wellcome 
kathy bartlett a spokewoman for burroughs wellcome said the 
syrup would also help doctors adjust the dosage 
azt capsules were approved by the food and drug administration 
in march 1987 and the syrup received approval last month 
azt was rushed into production in 1986 after only nine months of 
clinical tests when preliminary results showed 8 percent of 
patients died while taking the drug compared with 40 percent in a 
similar test group not given the drug 
azt is the only drug approved by the fda that directly combats 
the aids virus burroughs wellcome last month cut its wholesale 
price by 20 percent in response to complaints that the retail 
price 7000 to 8000 for a years treatment was too high

within 10 years pentagon spending will 
return to its level before the reagan administrations defense 
buildup according to a study by leaders of the defense electronics 
industry 
but defense electronics will still get a healthy cut of defense 
funds said officials of the electronics industries association 
meeting in los angeles 
defense electronics despite a declining overall budget is 
holding its own as a quality enhancer for most weapon systems 
said geoffrey k bentley chairman of an eia subcommittee that 
compiled the organizations annual 10year forecast in fact 
over the 10year period defense electronics will show real 
growth 
industry officials presented the study tuesday at the 
conference which attracted more than 350 defense industry 
executives and managers from across the country 
the 90page study drawn from interviews with industry 
executives congressional sources pentagon officials academics 
and wall street analysts says inflation will outpace the overall 
defense budget 
although the budget is expected to reach as much as 375 billion 
by the end of the 1990s it will actually shrink 15 percent when 
adjusted for inflation in 1990 dollars bentley said 
we are looking at 12 straight years of real decline which 
will bring us back to the early reagan years and fiscal 1981 he 
said 
officials warned however that a loss of power by soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev and a return by the soviet union to 
policies of the past could result in a change in the entire 
equation 
barring such a change cutbacks in bigticket items such as 
military personnel missiles tanks and aircraft appear inevitable 
association officials said but military spending will remain 
strong for defense electronics in areas such as space 
communications equipment hightech improvements in missiles and 
aircraft and other weaponry

than window dressing said arthur stevenson an analyst with

the dollar was mixed against major currencies in 
fairly quiet trading wednesday with traders cautious ahead of the 
meeting of west germanys central bank 
some analysts expect the bundesbank to raise its key lending 
rates when it meets thursday in an effort to push the dollar lower 
its discount rate now stands at 5 percent and the lombard rate is 
at 7 percent 
all eyes are watching the bundesbank tomorrow said ronald 
holzer chief currency broker for harris trust amp co in chicago 
west germany is one of seven industrial nations including the 
united states that have joined in a concerted effort to weaken the 
dollar 
analysts said that if intervention fails the backup plan is for 
some countries to raise their interest rates 
higher west german interest rates would make markdenominated 
assets more attractive than dollar holdings and would tend to boost 
the mark against the us dollar 
if the bundesbank decides to raise interest rates other central 
banks probably will follow analysts said 
if the germans do it it will be a matter of time before japan 
does it not only to show coordinated effort politically but also to 
bolster the yen said jack barbanel currency analyst with first 
global asset management 
some analysts said the currency markets have already come to 
expect a halfpercentagepoint rise so the bundesbank will have to 
kick rates higher to lower the dollar 
if they raise it only a halfpercentagepoint it will take a 
lot of the sparkle out of the deutsche mark and other currencies 
that it has appreciated against holzer said 
central banks began their intervention more than a week ago 
after a meeting of the group of seven industrialized nations in 
which they agreed that the dollars recent rise was 
inconsistent with longerrun economic fundamentals they are

a bill approved by the senate finance 
committee early wednesday would give more than 100 years of amnesty 
to fraternal groups taverns and convenience stores for pastdue 
levies under a littleknown tax on liquor retailers 
protests over the tax had grown after a pennsylvania elks lodge 
got a 9000 bill for 50 years of nonpayment 
the measure would prohibit the federal government from 
collecting unpaid balances and penalties on the 123yearold tax if 
they accrued before jan 1 1985 according to sen john heinz 
rpa 
heinz a member of the committee argued successfully to get the 
provision included in a sweeping budget bill both the provision 
and the bill were approved on voice votes 
although the tax has been in the books since 1866 the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms says that up to 40 percent of 
retailers never heard of it until the agency began a vigorous 
collection effort last year the crackdown began after congress 
raised the yearly tax 363 percent from 54 to 250 for each 
establishment 
heinz estimated his amendment would cost the government about 2 
million per year in lost revenues through the 1994 fiscal year 
according to bureau spokesman jack killorin the list of 
organizations liable for the tax includes some country clubs 
lodges limousine operators and even bait and tackle shops any 
organization that sells beer wine and distilled spirits directly 
to the public in all killorin estimates that 600000 
organizations must pay the special occupational tax 
responsibility for collections shifted to jthe bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms in 1986 from the internal revenue 
service killorin said in a recent interview that the bureau was 
working with states to make certain retailers aware of their 
obligations he said the agency was willing to negotiate payment 
plans so retailers can get their debt paid off 
opposition to the collection effort gained momentum in congress 
after elks lodge 109 in wilkesbarre pa received a bill 11 
months ago for 977698 from the bureau representing unpaid taxes 
and penalties back to 1940 when the lodge got its liquor license 
the elks who said they had never heard of the tax complained 
to rep paul kanjorski dpa who said in an interview wednesday 
that he has been fighting for a statute of limitations on the tax 
because the establishments being dunned include the small tap 
rooms the private clubs people who can least afford to pay a tax 
they knew nothing about for years and years 
bureau spokeswoman dot koester said wednesday that the agency 
was taking no position on the senate committee action whatever 
congress passes well enforce it wont be a problem for us she 
said 
the pennsylvania elks lodge which is celebrating its 100th 
anniversary recently settled with the bureau for 84412 lodge 
attorney peter paul olszewski said wednesday the lodge argued that 
it had not been open and functioning during part of the period for 
which it was being taxed 
but if the committeepassed provision becomes law olszewski 
said the lodge might petition atf for a refund 
you can call this the elks lodge bill i think there would 
be a tremendous amount of satisfaction to see congress remedy an 
administrative problem olszewski said 
heinzs amendment was included in a sweeping bill designed to 
make changes in the law to achieve the budget target set by 
congress at the beginning of the fiscal year heinz said in a 
statement wednesday that the provision provides reasonable relief 
to many retailers most of whom are small businesses and had no 
intention of evading a tax 
the house ways and means committee failed to include a provision 
similar to heinzs in its corresponding bill assuming passage by 
the senate the matter would be resolved by a housesenate 
conference committee

government bond prices finished slightly lower 
wednesday as trading slowed in advance of an important economic 
report later this week on employment in september 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond lost 116 point or about 
63 cents for every 1000 in face amount its yield held steady at 
816 percent unchanged from late tuesday 
corporate issues also dipped but taxexempt municipals advanced 
market watchers said dealings were listless for most of the day 
as traders were reluctant to make large commitments to either buy 
or sell bonds in advance of fridays scheduled release of the 
september employment report 
some analysts were looking for payroll growth of about 275000 
compared with growth of about 110000 in august 
that would suggest continued vitality in the economy and some 
analysts said they doubted that the federal reserve board would 
adjust its monetary policy as a result of that type of figure 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of 
shortterm intermediate and longterm governments were all down by 
between 116 point and 332 point the telerate inc financial 
information service reported 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer lost 072 to 117405 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures 
total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities 
of five years or longer fell 008 to 32970 
but in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 
actively traded municipal bonds rose 316 to 92 the average yield 
to maturity fell to 738 percent from 740 percent late tuesday 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 804 percent as the 
discount gained 3 basis points to 778 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills rose to 830 percent as the discount advanced 4 basis points 
to 787 percent yields on oneyear bills rose to 838 percent as 
the discount rose 2 basis points to 779 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was quoted at 8 percent down from 9 percent late tuesday 
but analysts said the relatively low funds rate was due to 
technical conditions in the shortterm market for bank borrowings 
as wednesday marked the end of a bank reserve reporting period

the dallas times herald turned to federal 
regulators wednesday in its war with rival dallas morning news 
asking them to revoke the license of a television station owned by 
the parent company of the morning news 
the times herald asked the federal communications commission to 
revoke wfaatvs license because of ah belo corps naked and 
unjustifiable actions in stripping the times herald of 26 popular 
features it had been purchasing from universal press syndicate 
belo general counsel michael mccarthy declined to comment on the 
action citing the times heralds pending lawsuit on some of the 
same issues we fully expect to be vindicated in trial he said 
as part of a joint venture between belo and universal press the 
larger morning news won exclusive right in the dallas market to the 
syndicates features which include doonesbury erma bombeck and 
dear abby 
the times herald has lost previous attempts in federal and state 
court to block the action and most of the features have begun 
appearing in the morning news a trial on the times heralds 
antitrust suit against belo and universal is pending in state 
district court 
belo has used its newspapertelevision combination to engage 
in conduct that severely undermines competition between the dallas 
morning news and the dallas times herald says the petition to 
the fcc 
the fcc has outlawed joint newspapertelevision ownership since 
1975 but allowed such ownership to continue in dallas and other 
cities where it already was in place 
wfaa is the leading television station in the dallasfort worth 
market 
under the joint venture announced in august belo and universal 
agreed to explore television programming possibilities for some of 
the syndicates features and belo president james p sheehan 
described the exclusivity clause as really secondary 
the times heralds fcc petition said the joint venture is 
nothing more than a sham to cover belos real agenda the 
elimination of its only competitor in the dallas newspaper market 
the petition says belos 1 million payment to universal press 
for the features suggests that belo is paying not for the right 
to produce new video products but rather for a monopoly of the 
dallas newspaper market 
times herald publisher john buzzetta said the petition was filed 
reluctantly 
we like competition but we want to compete fairly and 
honestly and insist that our competitor do the same buzzetta 
said in a news release 
the two papers have fought bitterly during the past few years 
even challenging each others circulation figures in court 
edyth wise chief of the complaints and investigations branch in 
the enforcement division of fcc said we operate totally on a 
complaint basis every action on revocation is on the basis of a 
complaint by listeners and frequently by competitors 
a complaint by a newspaper against a television station 
however frankly thats unusual she said although theyre 
free to do it

texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo said 
wednesday that eastern airlines is continuing to recover from a 
bitter strike and will emerge from bankruptcy proceedings as a 
better carrier 
the rebuilding of eastern is on target lorenzo said at the 
annual airport operators council international conference 
easterns machinists pilots and flight attendants went on 
strike march 4 forcing the miamibased carrier to file for chapter 
11 bankruptcy protection eastern and houstonbased continental 
airlines are both subsidiaries of texas air which also is based in 
houston 
were bringing eastern back sounder stronger and better than 
its been in years lorenzo told a luncheon at a houston hotel 
next year will be a great year for eastern he said its 
reorganization will be behind us the airline will be providing 
aggressive competitive service up and down the east coast in and 
out of atlanta and throughout south america 
this past weekend we added another 100 flights bringing us to 
about 70 percent of the prestrike eastern airlines or about 700 
flights a day he said and i dont mind telling you that by 
december well be over 80 percent of the prestrike airline 
but of the estimated 3000 prestrike pilots lorenzo said 
theres probably going to be 2000 pilots who may never see 
eastern airlines again because they were misguided and brainwashed 
by a national organization that has refused to face up to where we 
are today and indeed has tried to take over control of eastern 
airlines in an illegal way 
lorenzo also discussed the domestic airline industry and the 
need for carriers to be free to finance their needs there is an 
important link he said between the globalization of us airlines 
and the current concern by some over leveraged buyouts and foreign 
investment in american carriers

before a background that included jewelry 
and a clock purportedly made of a dismantled ss20 missile the 
soviet consulate was the setting wednesday for the announcement of 
a joint venture to put soviet products on sale in exclusive shops 
in both countries 
this is an attempt to show that working for peace is 
profitable soviet consul general valentin kamenev told a crowd 
of reporters nibbling on cabbagestuffed piroshikis out of the 
consuls kitchen we are going in the right direction 
kamenev and san francisco socialite pat montandon who has been 
waging a ussoviet peace movement of her own for eight years 
said the make peace profitable venture will install 
perestroika shops around this country to exclusively handle a 
variety of products from the ussr 
the climate for that in sovietamerican relations has never 
been better remarked kamenev 
pat montandon and associates and the soviet producers are to 
share in any profits from the sale of the goods that will be 
available in both countries she said the flagship shop of 3000 
square feet is scheduled to open in san francisco in the spring and 
investors are being sought she said 
at one point montandon modeled a decorated womans jacket made 
from the top of a red army uniform 
in a selffinanced program called children as peacemakers 
montandon estimated she has escorted some 200 youngsters to the 
soviet union in 22 trips since 1982

agreed to allow the montandon group to be his agent in the united 
states the artist winner of the lenin prize is to make available 
for export art work of his colleagues in the georgian union of 
designers 
montandon made an impassioned plea for the united states to 
lower tariffs on soviet imports she said current us policy 
amounts to a trade barrier to sovietamerican business 
relationships 
there are currently more than 900 joint ventures between the 
soviet union and other countries less than 40 of them are with the 
united states

the 50 billion congress voted two months ago 
to rescue failed savings institutions may not be enough a top 
regulator said wednesday raising the possibility that taxpayers 
could be asked for a second bailout 
federal deposit insurance corp chairman l william seidman 
whose agency is in charge of disposing of bankrupt thrifts told 
the senate banking committee it is much too early to reliably 
predict the cost of the bailout 
but he said it is possible that 50 billion will prove to be 
an insufficient amount to deal with potential failures 
his comments included in written testimony to the panel which 
is taking congress first look at the bailout since it was enacted 
aug 9 are the strongest yet from a government official private 
analysts have been saying for months that the 50 billion likely 
will prove to be only a down payment 
seidman said the resolution trust corp operated by the fdic to 
dispose of failed sampls expects losses on the 283 seized by 
regulators so far to total 35 billion 
by the time the bailout ends in august 1992 regulators may have 
seized as many as 300 more dead sampls bringing the total to nearly 
600 he said those projections raise questions about the 
adequacy of the 50 billion in rtc funding 
however treasury secretary nicholas f brady who heads an 
administration board overseeing the rtcs performance said i 
know of nothing thats occurred since the bill passed to change my 
mind that 50 billion likely is sufficient 
that isnt the point maybe we need 52 maybe we need 48 the 
point is weve taken a bonfire and tamped it down to the point 
where its embers brady said 
seidman answering questions from senators softened his tone a 
bit emphasizing the impossibility of making a certain loss 
estimate nevertheless he said theres no way we can say for 
sure that 50 billion is enough 
on a related matter he said the rtc may have to borrow 25 
billion or more in addition to the 50 billion to provide working 
cash until it can recover money by selling loans and real estate 
once owned by failed sampls 
congress authorized the extra borrowing but sen donald w 
riegle jr dmich chairman of the banking committee said 25 
billion was far more than envisioned 
so far the rtc has run through 20 billion 18 billion to 
close 24 small sampls 83 billion to handle five large institutions 
by next week and five smaller notyetcompleted deals 85 billion 
to replace highcost deposits and 14 billion as a reserve fund to 
handle liquidity problems at thrifts that have failed but are still 
open seidman said 
deputy treasury secretary john e robson said the inability to 
close the five big cases by sept 30 the last day of fiscal 1989 
means the reported federal budget deficit will be about 8 billion 
higher in fiscal 1990 
however he said that would not trigger automatic spending cuts 
under the grammrudman law the 1990 budget estimate taken for 
determining those cuts was made on aug 15 he said 
meanwhile both brady and seidman reassured committee members 
alarmed by the scandal at the department of housing and urban 
development that they are working to prevent similar abuses from 
developing at the rtc 
i think weve learned from the mistakes of the past added 
housing secretary jack kemp a member of bradys oversight panel 
seidman said the rtc last week issued an interim ethics code 
governing the thousands of independent contractors it is expected 
to hire to manage the real estate and other assets it is inheriting 
from the thrifts 
both brady and seidman said the rtc and the oversight panel 
chaired by brady were working well together despite initial 
tensions 
no joint enterprise of any magnitude is without its healthy 
frictions and ours is no exception brady said but overall we 
have gotten off to an excellent start 
at a separate hearing held by a 17member house banking task 
force rep tom mcmillen dmd complained about rtc projections 
that it would swell from 1150 employees currently to between 5000 
and 10000 
no one intended this legislation to create a big bureaucracy 
thats the last thing in the world i want he said 
rtc executive director david c cooke said his agency likely 
will handle in excess of 300 billion assets about a third of that 
difficult to sell if the rtc eventually has as many as 10000 
employees thats only one employee managing every 10 million in 
assets he said

united airlines largest union the 
machinists on wednesday formally rejected an offer to join the 
proposed 675 billion pilotmanagement buyout of uniteds parent 
company 
the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers had repeatedly expressed its opposition to the proposed 
leveraged buyout of chicagobased ual corp by its employees and 
management saying it could endanger the nations secondlargest 
airline but it had not issued a formal answer until the 
announcement from vice president john peterpaul 
after a thorough study of the proposed plan and after meeting 
with company officials the iam will go forth with normal 
negotiations as it would with any other carrier peterpaul said 
we do not feel that iam members interest would be well served by 
participating in the esop employee stock ownership plan program 
the machinists union represents 25000 of uals 70000 
employees its contract becomes amendable at the end of this month 
united said in a statement that the machinists decision was 
consistent with its previously announced and often repeated 
position 
but the company said the iam decision does not change the 
benefits that flow to uniteds employees from ownership of their 
company benefits we hope will be shared by all employees 
and the company indicated it would continue to woo machinists 
members saying we would welcome the participation of our 
employees represented by the iam and are prepared to continue to 
explore ways to achieve that objective 
the 300ashare plan calls for ual workers to own 75 percent of 
the company a management group headed by ual chairman stephen m 
wolf would own 10 percent and the remaining 15 percent would be 
held by british airways plc 
the total cost of the buyout including financing charges could 
reach 945 billion according to documents filed with the 
securities and exchange commission by pilots and management

stock prices reached record highs for the second 
straight session wednesday riding the latest wave of the powerful 
advance that began almost a year ago 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed 1653 to 
277109 stretching its gain since the start of the week to 7827 
points 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
831 up 656 down and 506 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 19459 million 
shares up from 18255 million in the previous session nationwide 
consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including trades in 
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the overthecounter 
market totaled 23199 million shares 
analysts noted some catchup buying by investors who were 
caught off guard by the markets rerurgent rally this week 
the new advance in stock prices was attributed in large measure 
to persistent strength in the dollar and declining interest rates 
talk began stirring in the financial world early this week that 
the federal reserve might soon find room to relax its credit policy 
further prompted by slowtomoderate economic growth and favorable 
inflation news 
interest rates levelled off in the credit markets wednesday but 
after hesitating for the first two hours of the session stocks

two former researchers at a johnson amp 
johnson subsidiary have charged the company withheld vital 
information about a painkiller that was linked to severe reactions 
and at least nine deaths before it was pulled from the market in 
1983 
in a lawsuit filed in state superior court in new brunswick the 
former mcneil pharmaceutical division researchers allege johnson amp 
johnson engaged in a corporate conspiracy to get drugs on the 
market even if they were medically inadequate and to maximize 
sales of the same regardless of consequences 
dr edward lemanowicz mcneils former assistant director of 
regulatory affairs and dr james dale former assistant director 
of medical research also contend they were forced out of mcneil 
for refusing to take part in the alleged coverup 
zomax a prescription painkiller developed in the 1970s was 
pulled from the market in march 1983 after more than 2000 reports 
of violent reactions and at least nine deaths 
johnson amp johnson based in new brunswick issued a onepage 
statement wednesday that refuted the accusations 
zomax was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 1983 
because of an increase in reports of allergic reactions it said 
there is no basis for their charge that johnson amp johnson and 
mcneil pharmaceutical falsified or delayed reporting any data about 
zomax or any other drug the statement said both of these 
former employees were treated with respect and consideration by 
mcneil and neither was asked to say or do anything inconsistent 
with the highest professional standards 
allan kanner an attorney representing the researchers said his 
clients sued because practices that allowed zomax to be approved by 
the food and drug administration and mass marketed despite 
potentially deadly side effects were never reformed 
this is not a suit solely about zomax he said this goes 
to the nature of what a corporation does the reality is that the 
people who get promoted there are the people who care more about 
the result of sales than protecting the publics health 
kanner said dale a physician who objected several times during 
the drugs development and the fda approval process was concerned 
that testing was insufficient that evidence of possible longterm 
kidney damage was discounted by the company and that warning labels 
for prescribing doctors were insufficient 
once on the market the suit alleges mcneil mishandled and 
understated telephone reports of adverse reactions that were made 
to the drug maker 
kanner said dale took several calls about patients who 
reportedly died after taking zomax 
he said dales superiors at johnson amp johnson rewrote the 
reports to hide the severity of the reported reactions and then 
destroyed dales source notes the reports were then sent to the 
fda 
kanner said neither of his clients was fired but instead were 
sent into a kind of corporate siberia he said the doctors were 
seeking compensation for lost wages lost tenure and possible 
punitive damages
